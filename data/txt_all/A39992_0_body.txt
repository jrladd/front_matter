Right Honourable,
MY Design in pre∣senting to you this Small and Mean Essay, is neither to keep it or my self from Censure; nor yet to take occasion to divulge

your Praises. As for the former it is ordinarly spoke in a Comple∣ment, without all Cause, and pas∣seth as such without any Effect: For it neither preserveth the Au∣thor from Reproach, nor the Book from an Answer, when any of them are deserved. And if I in∣tended to do the latter, I could hardly say that which would be thought too litle, to such as know you; but I must of necessity run the risk of being esteemed a Fla∣terer, by them, who are neither acquaint with you, nor your ex∣cellent Enduements and great Desert.
My purpose is only to shew both to your self and others, how sensible I am of the manifold Favours, I have received at your

Hands, in a Countrey where I was a Stranger, and you are, amongst the Gentlemen, the most eminent.
Yea further, you may challenge some Right to it as a Domestick, it being both Conceived and brought Forth within your Walls, while I had the Honour to attend your incomparable Lady, and some of your excellent Children.
Take it then, Sir, as an Evi∣dence of my Gratitude & Thank∣fulness, and yet be pleased to Ho∣nour him with your Favour and Friendship, whose great Ambition it is, to Subscribe himself,
Right Honourable,
