MADAM,
THose notes vvhich vvere lately vvritte forth for your priuate vse, I am now emboldned to make more common; not for any conceited worth in them,
 but to auoid the trouble, of yeelding satisfaction to o∣ther good friends, that de∣sire & expect the like office from me. I am sure herein I shall hurt none, but my selfe; nor so much as offend any, excepting those for whose vse the publishing heereof was neuer intended.
Your Ladiships fauoura∣ble acceptance of them in priuate, hath made them the bolder to come foorth in publike, and to grace them∣selues with the profession of your fauour, which is their greatest ornament.
I hope that you, who haue giuen them some intertain∣ment in your closet, will not carelesly passe by them as vnknowne, now they pre∣sent themselues vnto you in
 the street: the rather for that they come not alone, but accompanied, assisted and countenanced with a most profitable Treatise of the same Argument, writ∣ten long since by one whom your Ladiship reuerenceth, and whose person and la∣bours in the work of Christ Iesus, are (and that deser∣uedly) much esteemed of the people of God.
I shall not need to admo∣nish you of the vse of either of these Treatises: Them∣selues, how little soeuer, are in that point able to speake for themselues. Onely take ed (good Madam) least  their with-drawing of you from the damnable sin of profaning this holy Sa∣crament, you be not by mis∣construction
 brought vnto any wicked and superstiti∣ous adoration thereof.
Thus vnfainedly praying the Lord, more and more to blesse the worthy Knight your husband, and your self, and from heauen to reward those many fauors receiued from you both, I humbly take my leaue.
Ianuary 2. 1608.
