HAuing been requested (right Honourable) by a dy∣ing Souldiour, to publish in his behalfe, the xiiij. yeeres fruites of his mercinarie tra∣uaile, in the wars of the Low Countries: I haue thought fit for that the trauaile of well deseruing paines, shal not die together with the dead man, to publish his industrie, so worthy both of knowledge and prac∣tise, to the worlds view, for the present and future benefit of our Nation (as his chiefest care was) that they might with ease, reach into the knowledge of that, the knowing whereof, had cost him time, toyle, blood, and studie. The worke is commen∣ded by Captaine Robert Hichcock and others, such as experience hath made able to iudge in this ho∣norable

profession: so that for me to bestow more praises, vpon a thing so praised, were but to lessen what I wish increased, and to seeme to commend that which doth best commende it selfe. Onely thys ayde I couet, to adde for his greatest grace, that it would please your Lordship, vnder the pro∣tection of your honourable acceptance, to deigne the patronage of his painfull endeuours, and then the worke may be assured of defence: as when a well deseruing seruant, is supported by an able de∣fending Maister. Therefore onely by your Lord∣shyppe I wish this worke may be pefected, whose humors and honours of minde, so well suteth with the honourable matter it treateth on, that as there cannot be (of worldly things) a more worthy sub∣iect then this to write on, so can there not be found a more woorthie Patron, for a discourse of such worth, whose rase assured him a Souldiour whilst the flower was in the bud: and whose timely yeres since, haue witnessed that of his valoure, which neyther time nor yeeres can deface. I pray GOD rayse vp many such mindes, to make our Country of all Nations the most happy: and also that thys worke may stirre vppe the harts of all Noble men, Gentlemen, and all other her Maiesties subiects that minde to professe Armes, that by the exercise

of the same they may be the better instructed with greater skill, and so with theyr manly and valiant mindes, to the defence of our most gracious soue∣raigne Lady, Queene Elizabeth, and theyr natiue Countrey. And thus in all humilitie I cease, wish∣ing your Lordshippe such fortunes and happines, as doe euer attend so honourable and vertuous de∣serts.
