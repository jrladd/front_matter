Your pardon, Fairest, that, into the quire
Of your Adorers, my discordant Lyre
Hath thus far ventur'd, strucken to the same
By th' Cabalistick accents of your name.

 To which she thought her self oblig'd in duty
For to submit as vassal of your beauty.
And by her President Each Fathers Son,
She hopes, will modul forth an Æ²nison.
That to your glory this versatile round
May still with Eccho'd Diapasons sound.
