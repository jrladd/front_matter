SIR,
I Dedicate this Impression to you, be∣cause your Bounty occasioned it; and I am glad it did so, because I think such a Book may be always use∣ful in the Church; in which, 'tis to be feared, some, both of the Clergy and Laity, will always want such Advice as is therein offered. I did most affectio∣nately design this Book to Excite the most Serious Consideration of the Ex∣cellency of the Solemn Offices of our Com∣mon Prayers; and to give assistance, as well as I could, towards such performance as the thing deserved. I could scarce hope (tho' I much desir'd) that the Book should have had so good Success: But it pleased God (who best knew the sincerity of my Affections) to move first our Right Reverend Diocesan, and after∣wards
another Bishop, to recommend it to their Clergies; whereby the Effica∣cy thereof, to the end I designed, was much assisted: And I do also impute this your Pious Ʋndertaking, in giving a Book to every Lad that is put out Ap∣prentice, unto the same Divine Motion; And I verily believe, that, if these young Men would argue from your giving it them as they ought, it would mightily help to effect in them what I desire: For which reason I crave your pardon, for exposing an imperfect Character of you, while I endeavour to instruct them so to do. This Book, may they say, was given us by our Worthy Treasurer, who was so much esteemed in the City for his Wisdom, Piety and Readiness to all good Works as to be unanimously chosen to that Office; And that, in the discharge of it, hath out-done the Expectations of his E∣lectors, and the Example of his Prede∣cessors, and hath rendred himself a wor∣thy Pattern to all that come after him. The wholsomness of our Food, our warm and whole Cloathing, our sweet, cleanly
and well repaired Lodgings, our well ac∣complished School-masters, our diligent and careful Nurses and Attendants of all sorts, shews his great care of us: and all Men see the same in the healthiness of our Countenances; which is observed to be, beyond what was formerly: And how can we but conclude, that he, who was so kind to our Bodies, gave us this Book in kindness to our Souls; which he knew and we ought to consider) are in∣finitely better. And even for our Souls also we have found his Care exceeding great; for he hath caused us to be in∣structed in the Reasons of Worshipping God: and in the Right Way of doing it, both in Private, and in Publick: and we hear others applaud our good Order and decent Performance, in both respects, while we daily, Morning and Evening, Worship God in this great Family; and every Lord's day most solemnly Praise him in the greater Congregation; imi∣tating the heavenly Host, whose Voice was like that of many Waters or mighty Thunders in saying their Hallelujahs,
Rev. 19. And this assures us he belie∣ved this Book would teach us something very beneficial in that respect: And wi not God and Man and our own Conscien∣ces condemn us of Folly and Ingratitude if we do not read and consider it? I hope, dear Sir, these Youths will learn thus to argue themselves into a serious attention to what I have written.
I hope also, that your thus approving the Book, will perswade more of my Fel∣low-Citizens to read it, and that there∣by they may be drawn from the Imperti∣nence of Coffee-house Conversation, unto those holy Exercises of God's Worship, wherein they may find much better Diver∣sion; a Diversion which is as Rational and Sublime, as that is Mean and Foolish.
This little I have hinted to further the design of my Book not that I thought to add to the Fame of your Vertues, but rather to express that true Respect to∣wards you, which they have begotten in me: Who am,
SIR,
