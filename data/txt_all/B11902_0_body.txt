FOr as moch as the accostumable vse of this our realme after the long ab∣sens of our frēdes returned into theyr natyue cō∣tre, we semed than with gyftes and presentes the only sygnes and tokens of theyr affectyon towardes them, right worship full knyghte. I vnable to be a frend, yet of lyke affectyō wyl,



 and hart, as frendes are, haue addressed thys poore and rude present to welcome you wythe all, whyche coueteth not fame or estimacion that commonlye telleth the myndes of men, but that thing only, whō I knowe you to be to your power, a de∣fender & maynteyner namelye the glory of god & truth of his most sacred wordes the earnest of our saluaciō. Partly therfo¦re moued by affection & dutye for your benyuolēs towardes me, and chieflye for the hartye zeale you beare vnto the most sacred gospel of Christe Iesus I am so bold to dedicate thys, rude and vnlerned, yet symple and true lucubration.
Whom I hartelye desyre you to accept at my poore handes, not lokynge vnto the gyft, but
 vnto the mynde of thee geuer, not forgetting the gētylnes of Artaxerkices Kynge of Percia who refused not a draughte of colde water at the handes of a poore labourer, consyderynge his hart & not the basenes of y• gyft. Thus doyng ye shal shar¦pē any desyre hereafter, to vy∣syte you wythe soche lyke, my poore exercyses. Thus y• lorde god of myght and euerlasting power encreace you wyth hys grace and augment your knowledge in hys gloryous Gospell, AMEN.
