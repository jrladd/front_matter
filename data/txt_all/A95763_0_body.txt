My Innocencie seekes protection under your inte∣grity: if oppression, or temptaion, could haue driven, or drawn me to the Enemy, I might with others have enjoyed a slippery felicity: But I praise GOD, He hath given me a courage to maintain my honest resolutions, for my deare, but distressed Countries Welfare, against high, and powerfull Adversaries.
