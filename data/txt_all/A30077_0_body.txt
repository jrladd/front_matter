BEing perswaded (Right Noble Lady) by some friends, for pub∣like benefit to make this Colle∣ction of words common, which at first was intended onely for private use, (as written in my youth; at the re∣quest of a worthy Gentleman, one whose love prevailed much with me) I could not finde in heart to send it forth, no better furnished than with a bare Title; lest like an unknown Infant, it would be exposed to over hard usage, or per∣adventure scornfully rejected, adventuring a∣broad without countenance of any friend or
commander. Vpon sure knowledge therefore of your most honourable disposition, and former experience of your Ladiships favour toward me, I am emboldened to present this little Pamphlet unto your Honour, with hope that by your Patronage it shall not onely be protect∣ed from injuries, but also finde favourable en∣tertainment, and perhaps gracefully admitted among greatest Ladies and studious Gentlewo∣men, to whose reading (I am made beleeve) it will not prove altogether ungratefull. And al∣though I may well be taxed of folly or pre∣sumption, that for credit of a slender trifle, crave the assistance of so eminent a Person, yet such I confesse) is my care thereof (since I must not deny it for my own) and my dutie and devoti∣on so affected to your Honour, and all yours; that I have, (hoping of your Ladyships pardon) wilfully repelled all reasons which might dis∣swade me, chusing herein not so much what may seem most seemly, as what I suppose most behovefull for me.
Accept therefore I beseech your Honour, and receive under your noble tuition this little Vocabulary Treatise, which having been many yeers restrained of libertie, is now glad of en∣largement, especially recommended unto so worthy a Patronesse. The glorious Sun loseth
not the least point of his heighth by liberall lending down his light, and quickning with his influence the lowest creatures; neither is any eminency disgraced, that easily condescendeth to others desired good: which is also confirmed by the Poet, who saith;
Conspicitur nunquam meliore potentia causa,
Quam quoties vanas non sinit esse preces.
Not thinking needfull therefore to trouble your Honour with many words of entreatie (upon assured confidence of your well known Charitie and goodnesse) I conclude, sincerely wishing to your Ladiship, the best that may be wished, and resting my self ever,
