Most Noble Senators,
LEngth of Age argues strength of Constitution; and as in Naturall bodies, so this Rule holds good likewise in Politicall: Whence it may be inferrd, that the Signorie of Venice from Her Infancy was of a strong Symmetry, well nursd, and swadled with wholsom Lawes, which are no other than the ligaments of a State, or the Arteries whereby the bloud is directed and strengthened to run through all the veines in due proportion, though Nature allowes som to have a greter quantity than others. To this may be attributed Her so long duration, for having bin born a Christian, and Free from the beginning, She hath continued a pure Virgin, and an Independent (but only upon Her-self) neer upon 13 Ages; She hath shind in Her VVatry Orb among all other Republiques upon Earth, as the Moon doth in the Heavens among the rest of the Planets, Though She hath cop'd with the gretest Potentats of the World, and particular∣ly with the huge Ottoman Emperour Her Neighbour; ha∣ving not only scratchd his face, and oftentimes cut off those tuffs of hair wherin his strength lay for the time, but peeld his beard, and somtimes pluckd him by the Mustachos; She is now in actuall luctation, and hath bin any time these six yeers at handy-gripes with that monstrous Giant, who this yeer

intends to bend, and bandy all his Forces both by Land and Sea, to ravish and ruin Her; Therfore it imports all Christian Princes to resent Her condition, She being both the Key, and Bulwark of Europe that way; And, with humble leave I speak it, it may well becom England (now that she is more formidable at Sea than ever) to be sensible of Her case, That Republic having bin her antient Confederat ever since the as∣sociation of the Holy Warr, and having, for this last Centurie, mingled interests, and run the same cours of state with Her; Nor is it a Quaere altogether impertinent, but may very well admit of a debate, whether a warr against the Turk might not prove more advantagious to England than his wares. More∣over, if likenes may beget love, England hath reson to affect Venice more than any other, for in point of security ther is much resemblance between them, being both seated in the Sea, who is their best Protector; The one preserves Her-self by her Gallies, the other by her Galeons; The fairest flower of En∣gland is the Dominion of the Narrow Seas, the gretest glory of Venice is the Dominion of the Adriatic Gulph 700 miles in extent; Venice had the chiefest hand in framing the Rho∣dian Lawes for Sea cases, by which all the Levant parts are guided; and England was the busiest in constituting the Mari∣tim Lawes of Oleron, whereby the Western World is governd.
This following Survay (which is like a Frame indented with sundry peeces) will, I beleeve, make the Reder both out∣wardly and inwardly acquainted with this Mayden Re∣public, for it shewes Her policy and power, Her warrs, ex∣ploits, and confederacies, Her interests of State, together with Her advantages and defects, and how farr She hath trodd in the stepps of old Rome; Therfore, most humbly under favor, the Author deemd it a peece of industry not alltogether unworthy to be presented unto that Noble Assembly by
