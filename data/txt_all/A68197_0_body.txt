HAuing had iust occasion, Right Honorable, to re∣maine
in London, during the time of Trinitie terme last passed, and
being earnestlie required of diuers my freends, to set downe some
breefe discourse of parcell of those things, which I had obserued in
the reading of such manifold antiquities as I had perused toward
the furniture of a Chronologie, which I haue yet in hand; I was at
the first verie loth to yeeld to their desires: first, for that I thought
my selfe vnable for want of skill and iudgment, so suddenlie & with
so hastie speed to take such a charge vpon me: secondlie, bicause the dealing therein might
prooue an hinderance and impechment vnto mine owne Treatise: and finallie, for that I had
giuen ouer all earnest studie of histories, as iudging the time spent about the same, to be an
hinderance vnto my more necessarie dealings in that vocation & function wherevnto I am
called in the ministerie. But when they were so importunate with me, that no reasonable ex∣cuse
could serue to put by this trauell, I condescended at the length vnto their yrkesome
sute, promising that I would spend such void time as I had to spare, whilest I should be in∣forced
to tarie in the citie, vpon some thing or other that should satisfie their request; and
stand in lieu of a description of my Countrie. For their parts also they assured me of such
helps as they could purchase: and thus with hope of good, although no gaie successe, I went
in hand withall, then almost as one leaning altogither vnto memorie, sith my books and I
were parted by fourtie miles in sunder. In this order also I spent a part of Michaelmas and
Hilarie termes insuing, being inforced thereto I say by other businesses which compelled
me to keepe in the citie, and absent my selfe from my charge, though in the meane season I
had some repaire vnto my poore librarie, but not so great as the dignitie of the matter re∣quired,
and yet far greater than the Printers hast would suffer. One helpe, and none of the
smallest that I obtained herein, was by such commentaries as Leland had somtime collected
of the state of Britaine, books vtterlie mangled, defaced with wet and weather, and finallie
vnperfect through want of sundrie volumes: secondlie, I gat some knowledge of things
by letters and pamphlets, from sundrie places & shires of England, but so discordant now
and then amongst themselues, especiallie in the names and courses of riuers and situation
of townes, that I had oft greater trouble to reconcile them one with an other, than orderlie
to pen the whole discourse of such points as they contained: the third aid did grow by con∣ference
with diuers, either at the table or secretlie alone, wherein I marked in what things
the talkers did agree, and wherin they impugned ech other, choosing in the end the former,
and reiecting the later, as one desirous to set foorth the truth absolutelie, or such things in
deed as were most likelie to be true. The last comfort arose by mine owne reading of such
writers as haue heretofore made mention of the condition of our countrie, in speaking
wherof, if I should make account of the successe, & extraordinarie cōming by sundrie trea∣tises
not supposed to be extant, I should but seeme to pronounce more than may well be
said with modestie, & say farder of my selfe than this Treatise can beare witnes of. Howbeit,

I refer not this successe wholie vnto my purpose about this Description, but rather giue
notice thereof to come to passe in the penning of my Chronologie, whose crums as it
were fell out verie well in the framing of this Pamphlet. In the processe therefore of this
Booke, if your Honor regard the substance of that which is here declared, I must needs con∣fesse
that it is none of mine owne: but if your Lordship haue consideration of the barba∣rous
composition shewed herein, that I may boldlie claime and challenge for mine owne,
sith there is no man of any so slender skill, that will defraud me of that reproch, which is
due vnto me for the meere negligence, disorder, and euill disposition of matter compre∣hended
in the same. Certes I protest before God and your Honour, that I neuer made any
choise of stile, or words, neither regarded to handle this Treatise in such precise order and
method as manie other would haue done, thinking it sufficient, truelie and plainelie to set
foorth such things as I minded to intreat of, rather than with vaine affectation of eloquence
to paint out a rotten sepulchre; a thing neither commendable in a writer, nor profitable to
the reader. How other affaires troubled me in the writing hereof manie know, and perad∣uenture
the flacknesse shewed herein can better testifie: but howsoeuer it be done, & what∣soeuer
I haue done, I haue had an especiall eye vnto the truth of things, and for the rest, I
hope that this foule frizeled Treatise of mine will prooue a spur to others better learned,
more skilfull in Chorographie, and of greater iudgement in choise of matter to handle
the selfe same argument, if in my life time I doo not peruse it againe. It is possible also
that your Honour will mislike hereof, for that I haue not by mine owne trauell and ey∣sight
viewed such things as I doo here intreat of. In deed I must needs confesse, that vntill
now of late, except it were from the parish where I dwell, vnto your Honour in Kent; or out
of London where I was borne, vnto Oxford & Cambridge where I haue bene brought vp, I
neuer trauelled 40. miles foorthright and at one iourney in all my life; neuerthelesse in my
report of these things, I vse their authorities, who either haue performed in their persons, or
left in writing vpon sufficient ground (as I said before) whatsoeuer is wanting in mine. It may
be in like sort that your Honour will take offense at my rash and retchlesse behauiour vsed
in the composition of this volume, and much more that being scambled vp after this ma∣ner,
I dare presume to make tendour of the protection therof vnto your Lordships hands.
But when I consider the singular affection that your Honour dooth beare to those that in
any wise will trauell to set foorth such profitable things as lie hidden, and therevnto doo
weigh on mine owne behalfe my bounden dutie and gratefull mind to such a one as hath so
manie and sundrie waies benefited me that otherwise can make no recompense, I can not
but cut off all such occasion of doubt, and therevpon exhibit it, such as it is, and so penned
as it is, vnto your Lordships tuition, vnto whome if it may seeme in anie wise acceptable, I
haue my whole desire. And as I am the first that (notwithstanding the great repugnancie to
be seene among our writers) hath taken vpon him so particularlie to describe this Ile of
Britaine; so I hope the learned and godlie will beare withall, & reforme with charitie where
I doo tread amisse. As for the curious, and such as can rather euill fauouredlie espie than
skilfullie correct an error, and sooner carpe at another mans dooings than publish any thing
of their owne, (keeping themselues close with an obscure admiration of learning & know∣ledge
among the common sort) I force not what they saie hereof: for whether it doo please
or displease them, all is one to me, sith I referre my whole trauell in the gratification of your
Honour, and such as are of experience to consider of my trauell, and the large scope of
things purposed in this Treatise, of whome my seruice in this behalfe may be taken in good
part, that I will repute for my full recompense, and large guerdon of my labours. The Al∣mightie
God preserue your Lordship in continuall health, wealth, and prosperitie, with my
good Ladie your wife, your Honours children, (whom God hath indued with a singular to∣wardnesse
vnto all vertue and learning) and the rest of your reformed familie, vnto whom
I wish farder increase of his holie spirit, vnderstanding of his word, augmentation of honor,
and continuance of zeale to follow his commandements.
