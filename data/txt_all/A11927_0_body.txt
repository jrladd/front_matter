IN all Ages and times, there haue bene some godly and well disposed Fa∣thers that imployed theyr tyme and trauayle in descri∣byng the State of Christes Churche and of the common wealth of the Lordes Israell: As for example, In the tyme of the law before Christ, Mo∣ses, Samuel, Esras, Nehemiah, and others: After the law, since Christ, S. Luk, Theodoret, Sozomenus, Epiphanius, Nicepho rus, Iohn Sleidan, and in our time Maister Iohn Foxe oure Countrey man, (whose godly labour hath deserued great cō∣mendation.) As these fathers and godly learned men, in their times, by occasion haue labored and trauailed to benefite the Church of Christ, which through ignorance hath bene much endamaged: euen so that notable, graue, godly learned Fa∣ther, Petrus Ramus, the Authour of these Commentaries of the state of the Common wealth and Religion of Fraunce (whereof this booke is but the first part) hath taken no lesse paines to the same ende: and shall profitte in deede no lesse than the trauaile and paine of others, taken that way. For in his Commentaries (beside the godly lessons both concerning doctrine and manners, and otherwise) are conteined manye notable examples of Gods great mercyes, in defending and preseruing the Christian professors of his name in Fraunce in extreme perils, and also diuers experimentes of his seuere iudgements in ouerthrowing the cruel tyrants, and in puni∣shing

the persecuters. In consideration wherof, I thought is good to translate the same into our English toung, both for that I thought it should generally profit our countreymen, (and not those alone which vnderstand the Latin toung, as your worship doth:) and also for that I thoughte it a meete occasion, wherby I might testifie my good will and meaning towardes your worship, for the freendly inclination and wil∣lingnesse to benefit me, that I haue heretofore found in you. Desiring you to accept the dedicatiō hereof, though not for the worthinesse of the thing giuen, yet as a sure testimonie of such a well willing mynd, as by this which he here presen∣teth, declareth what he would do, if he had any thing of more price to giue: and also to suffer my trauaile to passe forth vn∣der your fauourable protection and garde, to the com∣mon profitte of our countreymen, and the glory of God, who send you long life, increase of wor∣ship, and the perfect felicitie of the life to come.
Your worships
Thomas Tymme.
