RIGHT HONOURABLE,
MOst requisite it is, that all bookes should bee protected by such noble Patrones, whose Dispositions and Indowments have a Sympathy & Correspondence with the Argu∣ments on which they intreate. The Title of this, is Summum bonum: to the attaining of which, those which best know you, can give assured testimony, that your Matutini, and Lucubrationes, i. your mornings me∣ditations, and night studies are devoutly intended. What the true Felicitie of man is, (or at least ought to bee) and the directest way to arrive unto it, is in this worke learnedly and religiously discoursed: and there∣fore desirous to bee shadowed under your wing, who

are as able to appcehnd, as judicially to censure. This Booke (Right honourable) at the request of divers no∣ble and well disposed Gentlemen, is brought to ex∣presse it selfe after a long silence: At whose importu∣nity I have added unto the originall such needefull or∣naments (in the former edition omitted) as best suit with the humour and fashion of the time; selecting you the sole Mecanas of so weighty and worthy a worke; whose serious contemplations are ymed a Reality, not Forme, as studying to be actually that, which others strive to seeme in appearance. Accept I intreat your Honour the perusall and patronage, as an humble Ten∣der of his observance and service, who as hee wisheth you the fruition of all the Felicities enjoyed by Man here on earth, so hee implores for you all the eternall happinesse ordained for him in Heaven.
Your Honours humbly devted
H. T.
