SIR,
BEing enioyned by the Ghost or 
beloued) to collect, gleant, or gather a bundle or trusse of Mirth, and for his 
bestrow the stage of the melancholly world with it; and withall to present it to som

 generous spirit, who was old Iohns friend; I thought upon many to whom I might haue
 my Dedication, who were both Royall, Honourable, Worshipfull, and all well-affected to∣rds
him. As to mention one for all, that Iewell of the world, and richest Iem of her sex, that
Magazine of the two inestimable Iewels, Patience and Fortitude; to that illustrious,
relesse Princesse I might haue recommended it, to whose seruice, and for whose happinesse,
his life and best endeauours, with his prayers and implorations at his death, were vnfainealy
rated. But my manners conceiuing the subiect of this Booke, of altogether to triuiall a
 to be sheltred vnder the shadow of the wings of transcendent and admired Maiestie;
 so many steps downe the staires with my inuention, where by good fortune I met with
 whom I knew did loue that old honest mirrour of mirth, deceased; and whom the world
ter knows, are, a true deunted friend to honest harmelesse mirth, and laudable recreation.
 herefore entreat you, that (when your more serious affaires will permit) you would be∣
 the looking vpon these my poore and beggarly wardrobe of witty Iests, whom I dare not
 Apothegmes.
And because I had many of them by relation and heare-say, I am in doubt that some of them
 be in print in some other Authors, which I doe assure you is more then I doe know; which
  be so, I pray you but to conniue or tollerate, and let the Authors make twice as bold with
 at any time.
Thus wishing euery one to mend one, whereby the rent and torne garments of Thred-bare
 may be well and merrily patched and repaired, crauing your pardon, with my best wishes,
aine
