THis Poem (Right Wor:) which I present to your learned view▪ some two yeares agoe was made fit for the Print; that so long keeping the corner of my studie, wherein I vse to put waste pa∣per: This first trew Oldcastle; thought himselfe iniurde, because he might not bee suffered to sustaine the scond Martyredome of the Presse: In somuch that I was contented he should stand bare-headed to these churlish times, and endure the censure of his vtmost enemies, onely to make his Death more glorious. Howsoeuer, now he passeth vnder your protection; and though my pensill be too weake, either for his or your picture; accept of the same, because it comes from zeale.
