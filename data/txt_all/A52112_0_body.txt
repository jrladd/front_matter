SIR,
THE Royal Society (in which you so worthily at this time Preside) having formerly done me the Honour to publish some of my Observati∣ons in their Celebrated Trans∣actions, it has now encouraged me to presume on your Patro∣nage, and made me prefix Your Great Name to this little Essay.
The World is in general so well acquainted with those no∣ble Endowments and great Abi∣lities, for which our most Wise
and Discerning Monarch so early raised You to the highest Places of Trust and Dignity, that only these poor Islanders of whom I Write, seem to be unhappily excluded from the knowledge of those many rare and excellent Virtues, which under Your Ad∣ministration do so signally Bless Mankind; of all which no One seems so necessary for me to im∣plore, as that of Your extraor∣dinary Goodness; which, I hope, will incline You to accept of this plain and humble Ad∣dress, as also to pardon the pre∣sumption of,
SIR,
