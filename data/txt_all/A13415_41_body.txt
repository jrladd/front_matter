NOBLE SIRS:
I Could haue soyled a greater volume then this with a deale of emptie and tri∣uiall
scuffe: as puling Sonets, whining Elegies, the dog-trickes of Loue 
to mocke Apes, and transforme men into Asses. Which kind of writing is
like a man in Authoritie, ancient in yeares, rouerend in Beard, with a promi∣sing
out-side of Wisedome and Grauitie, yet in the expected performances of
his profound vnder standing, his capacitie speakes nething but Mutimus,
But heere your Worships shall find no such stuffe: for thou I haue not done as
I should, yet I haue performed as much as I could. I haue not had riuers of
Oyle, or fountaines of wine to fill this my poore caske or booke: but I haue
(as it were) extracted oyle out of steels, and wine out of dry chaffe. I haue here of a graine of Hemp∣seed
made a mountaine greater then the Apenines or Caucalus, and not much lesser then the whole
world. Here is Labour, Profit, Cloathing, Pleasure, Food, Nauigation: Diuinitie, Poetry, the liberall
Arts, Armes, Vertues defence, Vices offence, a true mans protection, a Thiefes execution. Here is mirth
and matter all beaten out of this small Seed.
With all, my selfe for my selfe, and in the behalfe of Mr. Roger Bird, doe most humbly thanke your
Worships for many former vndeserued courtesies and fauours extended towards vs, especially at our go∣ing
our dangerous Voyage in the Paper boat: for which wee must euer acknowledge our selues bound to
your Goodnesses. Which voyage I haue merrily related at the end of this Pamphlet, which with the rest
I haue made bold to dedicate to your Worshipfull and worthy Patronages, humbly desiring your pardons
and acceptances, euer remaining to bee commanded by yon and yours in all obsequiousnesse.
