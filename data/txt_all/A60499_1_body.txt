MADAM,
DUring the long Conversation you were pleas'd to honour my Sister with at her own House, I perceiv'd so much goodness mixt with your Greatness, Illustrated with the greatest Efforts of Wisdom and Knowledge, that it not on∣ly brought me oftner to that dearest Sisters house then my Affections to her might have done, to ad∣mire the Noble Conduct of your Life, but also imbolden'd me to beg the Favour of laying this Treatise at her Majesties Feet. The Honour she was pleas'd to do me in the Manner of it's Reception, I must Impute to the great share you have in her Majesties Affections, and not to the weak Endea∣vours of
MADAM,
