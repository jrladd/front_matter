Right Honourable,
HAving received some kindness from your Lord∣ship, as also from the rest of His Majesties Com∣missioners of the Peace, for the County of Bedford; whereof, and wherein, your Honour is deservedly (for your known and well approved Loyalty) Sum∣mus procerum, & proximus à Rege, the Chiefest of the
 Governours, and the very next under, and after the King; therefore I thought my self obliged to shew my thankfulness, by doing something that might tend to the good of the whole Community. In or∣der thereunto, I was principally moved to Write this small ensuing Treatise, wherein is contained chiefly, The perfect Harmony, Consent, and Agreement between Divinity and Law, in Defence of the Go∣vernment by Law established in Church and State; and is plainly demonstrated, That Kingly Govern∣ment is by Divine Right. And now, my Lord, I most humbly beg your Pardon, that I presume to prefix your great Name before this Discourse: But since there is nothing therein, but what hath its Weight and Warrant from the Holy Scriptures, or our Authentick, undeniable, and well approved of Books of Law; I cannot but hope your kind Appro∣bation and Acceptance, and am very well pleased, I have the occasion offered me, to let your Honour know how much I am.
My Lord,
