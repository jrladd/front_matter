YoƲ drive furiously over the necks of King and Parliament, Lawes, Covenants, Loyalty, Priviledge, and no humane thing can stand before you: You are now fac'd by the ma∣jesty and light of God, while you are asleepe in a darke night of earthly affaires: You have appeald to God in your second Declaration, but did not expect so suddaine an answer: Tis eternall and almigh∣ty truth that must and will prevaile; if you come into it, 'twill save you; if you turne from it, you forsake your owne mercy; if you oppose it, you dash your selves in pie∣ces; you cannot goe from it, or besides it, but into the dark∣nesse of hell▪ The Lord is here Obraiding your unbeliefe, but mourning over his Jerusalem▪ with love to your persons, but with fierce anger against your practises: I would you had those lively and fresh evidences of your personall and everlasting good in your owne breasts, as I have; your e∣ternall state is sure; tis your present wandrings that are
here condemned; Blindnesse hath happened to you in part; and this is the time of casting you away; you will have a time of being received againe; you are now broken off through un∣beliefe, you will be graffed in againe: Tis your fall now, you shall have a restoring; you will wonder to behold so much goodnesse to your enemies, and so much severity to you Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgements, and his wares past finding out! I have reproved you sharply, or cuttingly, its pro∣per for you, With vengeance to save you, and to pull you as fire-brands out of the fire; your condition requires it; Gentle∣nesse is abusd, mercy despisd, you have a long time tram∣pled upon kindnesse, and obstinately refused the word of the Lord: You must remember my Sermon to you at Wind∣sor upon that Text. Overturne, overturne, overturne; tis Scripture still, and that word lives in and upon you. Salt-marsh his message quickly followed it, Depart from the tents of these unrighteous men; he lives still: And Mr Pinnels ad∣monition from the Lord following that: These, and other testimonies against you, have beene slighted and disobey∣ed; your sinnes grow greater, and the anger of God hotter against you; your reprieve is not your salvation; you are growne to a height of confidence and presumption upon your successes; your necks are as iron, and your brows brasse; and you walke uncontroulable in your way, triumphing as the onely Princes in the earth, as fit to sway the Scepter of England, and all nations; as the onely righteous, honoura∣ble people in the world; the great Lords of the Land▪ Therefore it pleases me to powre contempt upon you, to be shod with scorne and indignation, and so trample upon Prin∣ces as morter. Except I should deale thus with you, you would not be sensible of what I say, being hardned against
mercy; and having done all you have done against love; Prosperity ayes fooles, and therefore the rod is sit for their backs.
I know my dealing is just and righteous to such as you are, being (as Thl. 3.18, 19.) Enemies to the Crosse of Christ; seeming friends to his Gospell, Ministry and Kingdome, but enemies to his crosse: You hate to thinke that those faire beginnings of your peace and deliverance, should come to end in shame and death; you cannot thinke of leaving your hopes of outward glory, and lying down qui∣etly, to let the world trample upon you: This you count folly, Whose end is destruction: Destruction you practise, tis your worke, tis your end▪ you cant not see beyond it, and you are hastening to it, it is the center to which you tend; and therefore I cannot but shew it you, that you may stop your course before the pit shut her mouth upon you▪ Whose God is their belly; Your saith, understanding and God, is sunke into your bellies, and your rule, your strength, your confi∣dence is onely in sensuall and brutish things; your raisd spirits into the things of God are buried in an inferior region of grosse, dull, carnall affaires, and except I should peirce deepe, your slow bellies would not finde eares: Indeed you are so lost and drownd in sensible things of the world, and so eager in seeking for those things your belly, your carnall affections require of you, that I doubt you will be deafe to what I say. Whose glory is in their shame; You are full of glory in your great things that you have done; wonderfull things, a mighty presence of God. But in summe, what is it? You have torne a poore, sinfull Kingdome in pieces; You have executed wrath upon your Brethren, Friends and Country-men; You have laid desolate your
Father the King, the Parliament your Mother, your owne Country; this is your glory to be executioners; Assyria, the rod of my anger: What a crowne is this? Have you re∣strored, blessed, healed, comforted, saved any? No, you have but plunged the Kingdome and your selves into a pit of darknesse and confusion: When the things of God are proposd to you, to suffer for others, to love enemies, to doe good to all, to blesse all; you glory in your shame, and say, you serve the Lord in this, and there be lower as wel as higher di∣spensations: You are indeed servants of God, so was Ne∣buchadnezzar, so is the Devil; and you do the work of God, but tis base drudgery, tis his strange worke, to be instru∣ments of his vengeance; and tis a lower dispensation indeed, to dispense curses, not blessings, to be below in hell, exer∣cisd in the wrath of God, not above in heaven in the glory and love of God; and for sons, heires, so you would be thought, to take pleasure in such mean employment, is vile and unworthy: Who minde earthly things; this is another property of yours, your minds are now captiv'd to the earth, deepe in the lower parts of the earth, in the belly and foundations of the earth, pleading the earthly cause of earthly people, or digging caves and holes in the earth to secure an earthly peace to your selves.
Its high time to withstand you, and to rebuke this destroy∣ing Angel; for tis not men onely that suffer from your vio∣lence, but the Lord; your sword goes so deep, That it peir∣ces thorow his soule also: You are gone so farre in dissolving the foundations of government, that you are come to him that upholds the pillars of the earth: You reach to the head of principalities and powers, to the Lord who is the author and upholder of all these things; he is in these poor, bro∣ken and despised Ordinances of his, and sensible of every blow that is given to them: You have digged thorow the wall
of flesh and men, and broke downe that partition wall that divided them from God; and now you are in the bowels of the Lord, these miserable, broken powers are now the Lord: Goe on to teare and rend, you will at last looke upon him whom you have peirced, and mourne.
The King and Parliament cry unto God in their distresse, saying, Doubtlesse thou art our Father, though Abraham be ig∣norant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not, Thou, O Lord art our Father, our Redeemer. Though you in the greatness of your faith, and confidence in your priviledges, as high as Abraham and Israel in your literall forme, doe not know them, yet the Lord ownes them, and will heare their cry and deliver them.
Your proceedings are against the Lord; and though you say these things you do must be done till Christ come; and when he comes, then tis true, there will need none of these things to secure your selves, but as yet you must act as men: In this, you say, your Lord delaies his coming, and so drunke with your prosperity and victories, you beate your fellow servants.
But here you will finde your Lord in an houre that you were not aware of: You say he will come and destroy you and your waies in time, but he is already upon you, and your are not aware of it, and cuts you asunder; opens your inward parts, divides the secrets of your hearts, and ap∣points you a portion with hypocrites and unbelievers, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth: You act against God, and God against you; Your soules loath him, his soule loaths you.
Finally, Heres nothing written but what is written in your hearts; tis the opening your owne soules; tis but what you have feard, and that punishment which your owne humiliations and confessions have acknowledged just and due to you▪ Nothing but what I have suffered for
acting in those waies in which you are; What measure hath been measured to me by Gad, that doe I measure to you: And as I lay it on you, so I suffer it with you, and shall, be con∣tent to suffer till you are restored from this condition, of shame and wrath, to honour and love, and dwell with you in these everlasting burnings, which will purify you from all your filth. Till then, Farewell.
