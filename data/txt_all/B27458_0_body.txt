MADAM,
I Could have satisfy'd my self with the humble Content of a lower Patronage, were I not more ambitious of giving some Te∣stimony of that great Service which I owe You, than of deriving Ho∣nour upon my self from the glory of your Protection.
But tho Ambition be not my di∣rect Aim, yet I find that the greatness of your Quality and the
excellency of your Personal Accom∣plishments will render it suspicious that in this Dedication I rather intend Honour to my self, than Service to You, so that my De∣votion will appear doubtful and obscure, and my Incense, in too lite∣ral a sense, ascend in a Cloud.
But, Madam, let not the hap∣py necessity which I lye under of advantaging my own Credit while I serve you, prejudice the sincerity of my Intentions, or make my of∣ficiousness to be thought Mercena∣ry. 'Tis the constant Fate of all the Votaries of Greatness to be engaged in such a Necessity, and it happens to be so as well in Re∣ligion
as in Civil Address. Thus the Altar, which is intended mere∣ly for an Instrument of Devotion and Religious Service, is it self made aweful and Sacred by the Inscription which it wears, and becomes honourable by the Livery of Heaven.
Madam, I wish you could find as many things in this Oblation which would deserve your Patron∣age, as you will that will need it. However, I hope your goodness will pardon what your Judgment cannot approve. Here is one Com∣position which has had the For∣tune to please so well, that tis in∣couraged to make a second Appear∣ance
upon the Stage. Whether the rest are born under the same lucky Planet I know not; but your ac∣ceptance (Madam) will calculate their Nativity, for thence I shall take the measures of my Success. I value your single approbation more than the Applause of a Theatre, but if I miss of both, yet I hope you will give me leave to promise my self a Pardon for the Presumption of this Address, and to assume to my self the Honourable Title of
(Madam)
