Right Honourable,
IF (having nei∣ther merit or o∣ther relation to usher the admit∣tance) I seeme to intrude this present of so meane condition (whence ∣ver
 it came) upon your Lordships favourable con∣struction, and accep∣tance, the report of those many excellencies in you, imploy'd for the honour of your Prince, and good of your Coun∣try, so eminently obvious to the eye and admirati∣on of the vertuous, hath imboldned mee to the attempt, and must serve for excuse instead of a larger apologie.
I have not the will or
 skill to flatter, my thoughts aime at no base ends in this presumpti∣on; and were I not cer∣taine your Honour were as much a lover of good∣nesse, as an enjoyer of greatnesse, and no lesse humble than honoura∣ble, and would be rather a gratious interpreter, than strict censurer, my penne should not have been so ambitious, or da∣red to rest under so no∣ble patronage, nor so in∣considerate
 to have ex∣posed my owne and o∣thers weaknesse to pub∣lique view.
And yet the honesty of the subject, whiles it directs the mind to the consideration of spi∣rituall, and necessary concernments for the soules welfare, and a Christians profit, may thus farre presume (as not unworthy the peru∣sall of the religious, of what degree soever, at
 times convenient) to be∣speake protection for the matter, and pardon for the author, be hee what hee is, and his expressi∣ons otherwise never so meane, or deservings an∣swerable.
Please it therefore your Lordship to beare with this challenge, which I have not used in the way of my owne right, nor to forestall your Lordships judgement, (to which I humbly submit in both)
 but to intimate that by how much the present is the more considerable for any worth or value to be found in it, by so much the more it be∣longs, and is fit to such worthy patronage to be presented.
But herein your Ho∣nour must accept the will for the deed, from him whose desires in the height of their ambition soare no higher in that respect, than to become
 effectuall Orators for your Honors prosperity temporall and eternall, and that he may be wor∣thy
