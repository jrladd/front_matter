MADAM, I neede not haue a Lanterne & a Candle to inuestigate a vertuous woman, as Diogenes had to finde an honest man: they appeare like so many Starres, fixed in this terrestriall Globe. Yet no sooner did the Sunne of your presence enter into the Horizon of my thoughts, but it ouershad∣dowed all the fore-appearers Honour seated in your brest, findes it selfe adorned as in a rich Paace, making that excellent,
which makes it admirable, which caused me to present vnto your Ladiships protec∣tion, this my ill-looking Infant, the maden-head (as I may so tearme it) of my inuen∣tion, conceiued in my brains, by the frothy word of many Hyperbolizing selfe-concei∣tists, who deeme it their greatest grace, to be able to disgrace women. If then (exqui∣site Lady) an ouer-speedy or weaning desire of repulsing your sexes wrongs, hath caused my braines with Semele, to bring forth this obortiue Bacchus, or brood. Be you the Ioue to nourish it in the lap of your good liking, that being wrapt in the swaddling bands of your fauour, the cold of contempt may not so easily freeze it. And if Miner∣ua grant a safe returne to my Muse traf∣fking in her Indies, I shall, I hope, present you with a more richer Prize.
