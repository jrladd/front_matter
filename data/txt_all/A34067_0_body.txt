SIR,
I Cannot answer your
Inquiry, till I have
not only commended
but encouraged your
charity to your Coun∣try
men of the Roman Commu∣nion;

it being an excellent piety
to endeavour to reduce them into
the right way, who are so confi∣dent
in the wrong. The zeal of
most men expresseth it self by fu∣ry
and clamour against Dissenters,
whilst you shew your esteem for
the rational principles of the
Church of England by your dili∣gence
to propagate them, and
your desires to reconcile its mis∣informed
Adversaries to them. It is
one of the great properties of
Goodness to be communicative,
and a copy of S. Paul's most obli∣ging
charity, Act. 26. 29. to wish
that all whom you converse with,
were as happy in the choice of
their Faith, as you know your self
to be: wherefore that I may as
well quicken your generous de∣sign,
as invite some others to imi∣tate
so good an example, I will
propound these few considera∣tions.

1. The relation in which the
English Romanists stand to us
should excite our care; for they
are all Natives of the same Coun∣try,
Subjects of the same Govern∣ment,
and are called by the same
general name of Christians: many
of them our kind Neighbours, fa∣miliar
Acquaintance, or near Kin∣dred,
and some of them (where
their Prejudice doth not blind
them) persons of great reason, and
of so good inclinations, that they
are not made vicious by the evil
liberties which their principles do
allow: and shall we for want of
affection or courage suffer them
to be kept in ignorance and im∣posed
on at present, and to be led
blindfold in such a way as will ex∣treamly
hazard the Salvation of
their precious Souls hereafter? If
all the relations they bear to us do
possess us with any real affection

for them, we cannot but do our
utmost to undeceive them. The
frauds indeed of the Guides of
that Church are daily more and
more laid open, but for want of
such a charity as yours is, they
who are chiefly concerned, seldom
come to the knowledge of them:
I am sure those excellent pens
which discover'd them, did not
design we should make their delu∣sions
the subject of our mirth, but
the means to convert the Souls of
those who are linked to us in so
many bonds, that it is a shame we
should suffer them to be so de∣ceived.
2. But we usually excuse our re∣misness,
under the pretence that
it is impossible to convert them:
Had our Ancestors so esteemed it,
the World had wanted the bles∣sing
of the Reformation: I grant
'tis difficult, because of their rooted

prejudice, and the policy of their
Leaders, yet not impossible be∣cause
many have undertaken it,
and prevailed. So that as Seneca
saith in another case, it is not be∣cause
of the difficulty that we do
not attempt it, but because we do
not attempt it, therefore it seems
difficult, Ep. 104. The Philosopher
tells us where there is no difficulty,
there is no opportunity to exercise
either art or vertue: and if we
were once willing to take some
pains for so noble an end, it would
much allay the trouble thereof, to
consider the advantages which it
may bring not only to the party
which is the object of our charity,
but to the Church, yea and to our
own Souls also: for He that con∣verteth
a sinner from the errour of
his way, shall save a Soul from
death, and shall hide a multitude
of sins, Jam. 5. 20. and they who

turn many to righteousness shall
shine as the Stars for ever and
ever, Dan. 12. 3. Nay moreover if
such Pious endeavours should want
success on Earth, they shall not fail
of a reward in Heaven.
3. And finally, if we consider the
unwearied industry of our Adversa∣ries
in seducing, methinks it should
awaken our diligence, in strength∣ning
the weak, and reducing such
as are out of the way. It had been
very strange if the Apostles should
have been unwilling to travel for
the propagation of the right faith,
and the winning Souls of Heaven,
when the Pharisees compassed Sea
and Land to reconcile a Proselyte
to their particular Sect; and yet
alas 'tis too often seen, that the
children of this world are wiser
in their generation than the chil∣dren
of light, S. Luk. 16. 18. The
Hermit Pambo accidentally be∣holding

a theatrick woman dance
exquisitely before a loose assembly
at Alexandria, is said to have wept
abundantly, to consider how much
more pains she took to serve evil
ends, than he himself did to serve
God. Had we as much tenderness
as that holy man, doubtless we
have as great occasion for our
shame and sorrow, when we see
others more active to advance the
Mystery of iniquity, than we are
to promote the glory of God, and
the salvation of your brethrens
immortal Souls.
These Considerations, worthy
Sir, I know have excited your
charitable resolutions, and I hope
will prevail with many others to
endeavour the reformation of
their deceived friends: wherefore
that I may answer your desires,
and contribute my poor assistance
to so pious and generous a design▪

I have sent you the following pa∣pers,
wherein the delusions of that
party are discovered as plainly,
yet as modestly as may be, that
they may see in a little room how
much it is their interest and ad∣vantage
to embrace the true Ca∣tholick
Religion of the English
Church. I know all these parti∣culars
have been more fully hand∣led
by better pens, but most of
these writings have been by way
of dispute, and intended rather to
convince than perswade. So that
they may be very proper to give
fuller satisfaction in any particu∣lars
doubted of, when their great
Prejudices are first a little remo∣ved:
besides there are many
through unavoidable business,
company, or other divertisements,
who either have no leisure or no
inclination to read a larger vo∣lume,
being of Callimachus's mind,

that A great book is a great evil
▪ apud A∣thenaeum., who yet may
be prevailed with
to spare one hour
for so small an ab∣stract as this. The
Jewish Talmud tells
us of a noble Heathen, who came
to Rabbi Hillet, and offered to
become a Proselyte, if he could
teach him the whole Law at one
lesson, Tract. Sab. fol. 31. and if
you meet with any of his mind,
they may perhaps be gratified
with this little Abridgment,
wherein the mistakes of the Ro∣man
Perswasion are put into as
narrow a compass as they can
well be reduced to; so that even
those who are yet resolved to be
of that Church may perhaps not
be unwilling to peruse it, that they
may at one view see, what their
Religion is charged with. And if

it do not gain such persons, yet it
will teach them to censure mildly,
and to dissent from us with more
moderation: and as the volume is
small, and so may invite those to
its perusal who are delighted with
brevity, so the style is as mild as
the matter would allow, and can
give no just offence to any: the
particulars are so plain, and so
fully proved more at large by o∣thers,
that the Author resolves
not to dispute, but in pure charity
to advise the Romanists not to
resist apparent truth and reason,
having no worse intentions to∣wards
them than to set them into
the best way to Heaven; and if
any be angry at him or you for
this, they are the greatest enemies
to themselves, and more concerned
for their present Opinions, than for
their everlasting Salvation; but
it is to be hoped the sincerity of

your intention to do good may
oblige some kindly to accept this
Manual, at least as a testimony of
your love; to whom, if you have
the liberty of discourse, you shall
do well to clear those exceptions
which Prejudice may suggest, and
at least to obtain from them a reso∣lution,
impartially to enquire into
the truth of that which they so
confidently do believe: and sure,
it is infinite pity that persons of
excellent reason should be so much
enslaved, as not to dare to ask the
right way to bliss of any, but those
who have an absolute dominion
over them, nor once to go about
to judge for themselves in a case of
so great Concernment.
I would be loath to think so
hardly of their Superiours, as to
suppose they interdicted their Ad∣herents
from all converse with us;
for this were the exact parallel of

the Muscovian policy, where it is
death for any to travel out of their
own Kingdom without especial
license, for fear they should never
endure their former bondage,
when once they have seen the
freedom of other Nations: and if
once you can prevail so far, that
they will impartially compare
their own Opinions with ours, it
is probable they may become our
friends. I shall add no more but
to wish this Token may be as
kindly accepted as it will be cha∣ritably
offered by you, and to
assure you, you shall never want
his prayers for your success,
who is,
Sir,
