HOly Mother, from whom I haue re∣ceiued all that I haue, and more then I haue; to whom I owe both my selfe & seruice: Look∣ing about me, vnto whom I should De∣dicate this little Treatise, I could finde none more fit, in respect of dutie
 from me, nor none more fit in respect of parentage frō you, you being the high∣est 1 Ioh. 5. 1. Psal. 45. 9. for birth; none more fit in respect of matter; it concernes thy self: none more fit to free me from censure of any by-respects; nor none more right to claime it at me, nor none more worthy to de∣serue it of mee then thy selfe. To thee therefore, holy Mother, doe I presume to offer these first ripe fruits complete of my meditations, as a handfull of man∣drakes such as they bee: receiue them Gen. 30. 14. Mother; what though they be crazed in the gathering, and so made vnsighta∣ble, yet if they will procure thy Hus∣bands loue, whereby thou mayest bee made more fruitfull, accept of them; of which good wil of thine, I haue no cause 1 Cor. 4. 7. 1 Cor. 11. 23. to doubt, seeing they are thine owne, re∣ceiued from thee, for thee; such there∣fore as I haue receiued, doe I offer vnto thee and no other: passe by my vnskil∣fulnes, accept of my willingnes; And so doing, thou shalt increase my diligence to helpe thy furtherance. I rest a sonne of thine age,
