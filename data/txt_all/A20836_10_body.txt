SIR, to none haue I beene more beholding, then to your kinde parents, for (I must truly confesse) aboue the meaâˆ£sure of my deserts: Many there be in England of whom for some particularity I might iustly chalenge greater merit had I not beene borne in so euill an howre, as to be poisoned with that gaule of ingratitude: to your selfe am I ingaged for many more curtesies then I imagined could euer haue beene found in one of so few yeeres: nothing doe I more desire, then that those hopes of your toward and vertuous youth, may proue so pure in the fruit, as they are faire in the bloome: long may you liue to their comfort that loue you most, and may I euer wish you the encrease of all good fortunes.
