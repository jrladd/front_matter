SIR,
I Am bold to present you with this Peece of the PAS∣SION, the Originall designed by the curious Pensill of Gro∣tius: whose former afflictions seeme to have taught him pli∣able passions, and art to rule the affections of others: cloath∣ing the saddest of Subjects in the sutable attire of Tragedy; not without the Example of two ancient Fathers of the Primi∣tive Church, Apollinarius and Nazianzen. The Argument is

of both the Testaments a pathe∣ticall Abstract. Those formi∣dable Wonders, effected by God in his owne Common-wealth; those stupendious Miracles, for truth a Pattern to all History, for strangenesse to all Fables; here meet together to attend on CHRIST'S PASSION. The ef∣fects of his Power here sweet∣ly end in those of his Mercy: and that terrible Lord of Hosts, is now this meeke God of Peace; reconciling all to one another, and Man-kinde to Him-selfe. Sr. in this change of Language I am no punctuall Interpreter: a way as servill as ungracefull. Quintilian censures a Painter,

that he more affected Simili∣tude then Beauty; who would have shown greater Skill, if lesse of Resemblance: the same in Poetry is condemned by Horace; of that Art the great Law-giver. Thus in the Shadow of your Absence, dismist from Arms by an Act of Time, have I, in what I was able, continued to serve you.
