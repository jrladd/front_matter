 TO you that (like the sollid wheeles of Fate)
Giue sweete or troubled Motion to a State:
 To you that bath our soules in Sacred streames,
(In which they thriue as you grow Hot or Colder:)
 And last, to you, the Kingdomes beames.
(All, strong Collumnes that vphold her.)
O let me not seeme bolder
Than my country zeale requires,
If these weake (but hallowed) fires
Offer vp This Sacrifize,
Which vpon the Altar lyes
Of my hearts Deuotion.
Since so strange Commotion.
(Now) with giddy base Alarmes
Puffes the Romist vp in Armes,
That he dares his Cullors vant
Gainst th'vnmeling Protestant:
O You, that our Chieftaines are,
Giue not o're this holy warre,
Fight it out. You cannot fall,
God being sworne your Generall.
That your Triple darts may hit,
All your Nerues together knit,
And shoote'em with an English hand,
So shall your Heires and Houses stand
(Like Pillers) on fme Bases. So
Great Brittaine shall grow greater, and her Land
Enlarge as Wee these Lines: your Peace shall flow
Cleere: High: and smooth: So The Seauen Hills shall fall,
