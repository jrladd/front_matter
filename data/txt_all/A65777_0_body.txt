MADAM,
NO wonder if a complaint
falling from your mouth,
that you found the conside∣ration
of Heaven dry, and
knew not how to frame a content some
thought of it, was able to set a dull
wit on work, and make an insipid pen
distill milk and honey: for it is you that
do it. Accept therefore these nine drops
of oyl, which the fervour of your desire
has extracted from a hard Flint. But
I must advertise you, they still retein
their stony nature; and unlesse you apply
the same fire, according to the Rules

of Alchimy, beginning with a soft
and gentle heat, and proceeding with
a constant encrease; they will neither
render their sweetnesse to your sense,
nor their balsamick vertue to your sub∣stance.
For (Madam) in the peru∣sall
of these Discourses, you will easi∣ly
find the best method to be, first qui∣etly
to read them, seeking no farther
then onely to understand, and after∣wards
by more serious thoughts to im∣print
and sink them deep into your af∣fections.
By serious thoughts, I mean
not forc'd impetuosities of your will,
upon a conceit that you are rapt to su∣pernaturall
and unintelligible heights;
but onely such reflections as the care
of friends, of children, or houshold af∣faires
(where your help is required)
use to stirre in you: for these are natu∣rall
and free, and (apply'd to what
ought to be our greatest care) work
those solid vertues which make a
true Christian life the principall aim

of all our desires and endeavours,
and the principall wish to your Lady∣ship
of,
MADAM,

From Paris this 1.
of Sept. 1653.
