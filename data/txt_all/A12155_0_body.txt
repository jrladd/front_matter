SIR, I know you, and in that your worth, which I honor more then greatnesse in a Patron: This Comedy com∣ming forth to take the ayre in Summer, desireth to walke vnder your shaddow. The World oweth a perpetuall remembrance to your name, for excellency in the Musicall Arte of Poesie, and your singular iudgement and affection to it, haue encouraged me to this Dedication, in which I cannot transgresse be∣yond your Candor. It hath passed the Stage; and I doubt not but from you, it shall receiue a kinde welcome, since you haue beene pleas'd to ac∣knowledge the Author.
