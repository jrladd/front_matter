P. M. D.

TImes ancient Records whilst I here unfold,
And those great things that have been done of old
At whose feet else should I my Labours lay,
But at the daughters of Mnemosyna?
And when I track the Circuits of the Sun,
The Poets Father, and how times have run
From his first Fabrick to these days, to whom
But you (fair Sisters) should my Travels come,
Who are their Parent too, and have a share
As well as he in what they have or are.
Take therefore these my Works, but take them wel,
As Mothers do the tales their children tell.
