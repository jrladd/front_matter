SIR,
IN those jocund dayes, when ingenious Spirits were not daunted to behold the Physiognomy of their Minds and Man∣ners in the Mirrour of a Dramatick-Poem, this Comedy gained the success of a good Censure, and received more Acceptation then I thought it merited: Yet since the importunacy of Friends hath prevailed with me (in this tempestuous season) to print it; Prudence hath well instructed me to shrowd it under the undoubted safety of your Protection; because I am assured that the glittering influence of your bright Approbation, will, as the rising Sun doth gild all Trees he looks upon, set such a lustre on these Leaves, that Time armed with En∣vie shall never extinguish; such lawful confidence hath he assumed that wisheth your everlasting prosperity, and de∣sireth no other temporal Title, then to be found in the List, though the least of,
SIR,
