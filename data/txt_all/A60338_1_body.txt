MY most dearly beloved, for your and mine owne pri∣vate use, this Treatise was at first especially intended, and this is the best provision J can make for you: though outward comforts should fayle you, these will al∣wayes be most usefull to you, for Piety hath the promise, 1 Tim. 4.8. And Promises in your hearts are better then pearles in your Chests: but J counsell, beseech, and charge upon evry one of you
most earnestly (as it most nearely concernes you, and the neglect whereof will the more condemne you) that as you love God, and your owne Soules, as you tender my affection, and will answer be∣fore the Judgement Seate of Christ, 1 Tim. 6.13. To remember ap∣ply and practise, to reade, study and observe what J by Gods grace, with so much care and paines have thus collected for you, endeavour to get and keep the Testimony of a good conscience in all things, Acts 24.16. Sinne not against the light thereof willfully for any respect, 1 Sam. 15.22, 23. Away with knowne sins whatsoever you doe, for those are most haynous, uncomfor∣table,
dangerous, and (without repen∣tance shewed by amendement) dam∣nable, Num. 15.30, 31. Deut 19.19.20.21. In well doing commend all to the Lord, Ps. 37.3.5.7. And be content with his good pleasure, Heb. 13.5, 6. Yea trust him most in greatest extremity, Isa. 50.20. As he is God he will send help in every need, Ps. 50.15. & 9.9. & 46.1 & 142.4, 5. & 72.12. And goe all how it will, all shall (through the Lords free mercy in Christ goe well with you, Hos. 14.4. Col. 3.11. Ro. 8.28. Eccl. 8.12. Isa. 3.10. Ps. 37.37. For so run all the Promises through him unto you, 2 Cor. 1.20. 1 Cor. 1.30. 1 Tim. 4.8. Peruse them J pray you.

Now I most humbly and unfain∣edly beseech the Lord God our hea∣venly Father, with his most holy spirit, throughly to sanctify every one of you, that you may walk with, call upon, and trust in him aright, and by his infinitly wise, Almighty, most mercifull, faithfully promised, never fayling helpe to make every one of you every manner of way truly happy here and for evermore through our alone all-sufficient Sa∣viour and perpetuall intercessor, the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.
