IN the remembrance of a sorrowful losse I had by the death of the last Lord Chan∣celor, (good Sir William Hatton) and considering your great countenance partly declined by that soddaine acci∣dent, besides the great soms of money you were left to pay. For the parting from such an ho∣nourable friend, I thought (euery peece of cause well waied) you knowe as well what calamitie is as a meaner man, and feeling the smart and weight of that burthen, before you were ready to support it, your care and ca∣lamitie could not be little. First for the losse of so great a comfort, & next for the sorrow & trobles that belongs to such a losse, though lands or liuings helps to beare of a peece of the vexasion of mind, yet the body shall al∣wayes beare to the death a sorrowfull imaginati∣on of that hastie mishap, the impression therof shal neuer goe out of your memory, so long as life lasteth. So good sir, in signe of some consolation, I present you a discourse of Calamity, the right path to come to quietnesse, and the very hie way that leades a good mind to thinke of the immortality of the soule, thus presuming your fauorable acception of the same, I passe to the discourse of Calamity, wishing you much worship, hartes ease & health.
