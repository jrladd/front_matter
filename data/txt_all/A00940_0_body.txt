OF AL THINGS
vnder the sunne (Right
Woorshipfull (which are
at greatest disagreement,
the motions of mans
mind, by the iudgement
of the learned, are in such
a degree of contrarietie, that they are said
to be at mutuall strife, by reason of that same
, which our
corrupt nature, confirmed by euill custome,
doth procure.

A proofe heereof appeareth in the confession
of that notable conuert of Tarsus in Cilicia, in
whome (his apostolicall vocation notwith∣standing)
this opposition was so effectuall,
that he acknowleged a lawe in his members, re∣belling
against the lawe of his mind, and lea∣ding
him captiue vnto the lawe of sin; where∣vpon
he vttered this patheticall exclamation,
O me miserum! Quis me à corpore mortis hu∣ius
vindicabit?
For doubtles, there is no reasonable creature
consisting of soule and bodie, in whose mind
contrarie motions are not incamped, making
manie a hot skirmish, to amplifie and inlarge
the limits of their regiment; in so much that of∣tentimes
we see some soonke and swallowed vp
in seas of disquietnes, whiles waiward will
rageth against right reason, Alternis ictibus
sese mutuo impetentes, and striuing for superi∣oritie.
Heerevnto are referred the good and bad
liues of men, their thoughts, words, deeds, and
whole conuersation, honest or dishonest: to the
controlling of a certaine Greeke prouerbe, sup∣posed
of some to be a doctrine void of all
contradiction, and thus cited of the Poet:
; alluding to spirits,
vnto whome they ascribed the full charge of
mans life.
But to omit this controuersie (Right Wor∣shipfull)

so it is, that hauing read a compendi∣ous
discourse of a fatherlie churchmans pen∣ning,
intituled, Vrtutum & vitiorum certa∣men,
& seeing the same most liuelie describing
the hidden hart of man, and the variable state
of the same, I found that it is nothing else, but
a continuall temptation, and (as the patient
Idumēan calleth it) Militia super terram: in
consideration whereof, I haue called this english
booke deriued out of latine, A Monomachie of
motiues in the mind of man, &c.
Which worke written at the first in a for∣ren
tongue, and for the common behoofe of well
disposed people, turned into our owne natiue
speech, as affoording verie present remedies a∣gainst
the rebellious affections of flesh and
bloud; I submit to your right woorshipfull pro∣tection,
presuming of no worsse acceptation,
than my former labours haue atchieued,
and for this and all other offers of
vndeserued bountie, yeelding no
lesse thankefulnes, than my
bounden dutie enioineth
mee to exhibit to
so good a Pa∣trone.
