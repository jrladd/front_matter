Much esteemed in the Lord,
WHat was lately at the request of some of you Preached, is now (with some small Addi∣taments) upon the like score Published.

A hopeful intimation, that God hath yet a gra∣cious purpose towards this poor Church of his, that hee hath a Harvest yet to bee ga∣thered in this field, whereunto hee is pleas∣ed to send forth such a succession of Labour∣ers. Hereunto you have also (at the same intreatie) affixed the latter service of that day, the word of Exhortation; which giveth the like account of what is required at the hands of such servants of the Lord, as are thus dedicated unto him, and so, fitly ser∣ving as an Applicatory supplement to the aforesaid Doctrin. May both these conduce to the furthering of that good work, for which they were, and now are intended, wee have what wee aimed at, and shall  that God who maketh us in the least degree Instru∣mental in any service to him and his Church. In the desires and hopes whereof we sit down, and rest
