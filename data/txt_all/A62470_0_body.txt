THere be many useful Treatises set forth upon this subject (the Lord be blessed) concerning Mans mortali∣ty, and for the Preparation and the Conso∣lation of all such as do minde their frail condition, and their souls salvation. This, that I do here offer to you, as it hath been for many years in my thoughts, and for the most part prepared: so now, upon daily expectation of leaving this evil world, do I intend it only for the use of some particular Friends; who, I presume, will prize it before the best Marchpane, and prefer it before those fre∣quent entertainments, by Gloves, or Rings, or Ribbons. In our Health we have profi∣table Sermons, and godly Ministers, and Christian Company, and holy mens Books, to repair unto for soul-refreshment; but, in a retired languishing, painful sickness, we may perhaps, be deprived of most of these:
 For this cause I have here gathered, into as small a Volume as may be, much of it, from other mens heavenly Meditations, that, which takes in the four several seasons of decaying man; relating, 1. To the time of his present health. 2. To his first sickning. 3. To the keeping his Chamber. 4. To certain signes of approaching Death. 5. To these is added, (for the welcoming of it) some remarkable Examples of holy mens cheerful deportment in their Christianly departing out of this mortal Life. To hold you too long in an Epistle, is not proper for such an occasion as this; and therefore I shall draw to a conclusion, and only recommend it, and all you my good Friends, to the great Lord and Master of us all, the Lord Jesus Christ; who is the Propitiation for our sins, and by whom we are reconciled to the Father: in humble assurance whereof, I remain,
