NOBLE SIR,
I Have made bold to borrow your faire name, to grace the Front of my Book; It will passe for currant (I hope) now it hath your Superscription stampt upon it. Nay, doe not sweat for the matter. I will not put the sweetnesse of your modesty to the torture of a blush. I protest (were I necessitated to one of thē) I would rather choose to bee rough with you, then to flatter you. The first (I acknowledge) is an incivility; but yet the second (though Courtly) carries with it the greater danger, and the juster anger. I know the roads of Dedications well enough; It is expected there should be fucus and cerusse in them: but (if a man could find it) there is a nearer and a cleaner way. I will bee plaine with you. I stuck a while at the very word Dedication, because they doe malè audire, are something out of credit, by reason of the daubing that is in many of them: Nor had I adventured
 upon any, (especially to you, who I know would receive an Inventory of your owne good parts in line with a challenge) but that I was confident to my selfe that I had pur∣chased already in the world, the opinion of a blunt man, and therfore shot-free from the imputation of a flatterer. I beseech you, sup∣pose me not so weak to think that I beleeve any thing here (which is mine) worthy of the noyse of a Dedication and that to you. They who know you, know you deserve greater Presents, my hope in this is, they who know you not but in Landskip, (a farr off and mixt with other faire peeces of vari∣ety which make up a beautifull prospect) will certainly divine that there is something more in you then in ordinary men, and that you deserve wel of the Church and Clergy, when they shall see one of the surliest of our Tribe, leave the pursuit of Lions, Wolves, & Tygers (a game he takes delight in) to stand still onely to observe you, and glory to stile himselfe who otherwise under his gracious God and King, is free as the ayre, which cir∣cumscribes him)
