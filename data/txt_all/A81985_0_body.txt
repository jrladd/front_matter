Most Noble Ladies.
AUGUSTUS being invited by a private Gentleman to his house,
and but slenderly enter∣tained, far below the Majesty of so great an Emperour; instead of thanking him, gave him a secret but a smart checke for it, Nesciebam me tibi tam familiarem esse, I knew not (saith he) before that we were such familiars. Though Augustus like your Ladiships might just∣ly taske and check me for my over-boldnesse in commending this
Babe of Providence unto your Protection, yet I am more then con∣fident when I reflect upon your Ladiships candor and goodnesse (not to mention any other of that golden chain of Heroine ver∣tues wherewith you are in the highest mea∣sure beautified and a∣dorned) that the pre∣sumption of these my addresses unto your most noble Ladiships, will be no lesse then fa∣vourably
excused, if not graciously accept∣ed: In regard where∣of I cannot but con∣ceive my selfe highly honoured at this jun∣cture of time to be in a capacity to serve yee in presenting this Chri∣stian Orphan to your Ladiships most graci∣ous tuition. And in∣deed I should be very much wanting in my duty, by being accessa∣ry to the worst of vices (Ingratitude) if up∣on
the uninterrupted continuance of so many liberall expressions and indulgent effects of your favours and bounty towards me, had I buried them all in silence by omitting the present opportunity so strangely offered, as to the Dedication of this Treatise, which together with all my best services I once more humbly recom∣mend to your Ladi∣ships Acceptation, Pe∣rusall,
and Patronage, not thereby presuming to informe yee of any thing you know not, or confirme you in any thing you scruple at, for I am too mean an Orator to give yee Cha∣racters correspondent to your Ladiships me∣rits; 'tis as far above my ability, as I am be∣low your Eminency: I must therefore doe by your Ladiships, as the Ancient Heathen did by the Images of their
Gods, on whose heads when by reason of their height they could not place the Crownes of∣fered to their Deities, they humbly laid them at their feet: ever vowing my constant prayers for your Ladi∣ships Improvement of all vertues and saving graces in order to the eternity of glory, it be∣ing the height of my Ambition so to pro∣strate my endeavours
and expresse my self as I am
