SIR,
THE Subject of these fol∣lowing Papers being Phi∣losophical, and so not fo∣reign to the Conversations you frequent, I could not direct them better than to the Person whom the Royal Society have so often made choice of to fill their Chair. For tho' your Business hath been much in the open World, yet am I well assured that Things of this Nature have always been your Recreation

and Delight. The Truth is, your Attention to hear me discourse of my Travels under Ground, and the Uses I pro∣posed of what there I found, gave me no small Encourage∣ment to expose my Observati∣ons to the publick View: And 'tis my Hope, that those Things may find Pardon from others, which have had Approbation with you. I am very truly,
SIR,
