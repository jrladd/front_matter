My Lord,
THis following Discourse doth chiefly tend to disswade from Division, and perswade to Peace and Ʋnity; shewing the danger of the one, and the excellency and necessity of the other: a Subject, which I thought most necessary for that occasion upon which it was preached; The unanimous consent of the Citizens, in the Election of your Lordship to be Mayor for the succeeding Year, gives me some ground
of hopes, that what was said was not al∣together unuseful. I need not mind your Lordship (who is so well known to be a Lover of Ʋnity) that it is your Part, in that station, wherein God hath placed you, to uphold, and promote this good A∣greement, what in you lies, in that great Body over which you are placed, as it seems, by the special Providence of God, for this very end and purpose. What was upon that great Solemnity preached, is now, by the Command of your Lord∣ship, and the Honourable Court of Al∣dermen, made publick. And that it may have some influence upon us, to breed in us a general abhorrence of Division and Dissention, and provoke all Protestants to a serious study of, and endeavour after a happy Ʋnion both in Church and State, is the earnest Prayer of,
My Lord,
