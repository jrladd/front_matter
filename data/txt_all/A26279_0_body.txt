Honourable SIR:
IT is not my Ambition, nor was it ever my Desire to appear in Print, but was always of your Honours Opinion for that, and did ever then think my self most secure, when most private: Nor had I now exposed this to the publick view, had not the duty I owe my too much Dishonoured Mother the Church of England, the Importunities of some Friends, and the great desire I had to shew your Honour some Fruit of the Vine your Honour hath preserved, like so many
perswading Orators prevailed with me, to present your Honour with this Clustre, by the smalness whereof your Honour may well guess the Soyl to be a Wilderness wherein it grew. I must confess my repentance is rea∣dy to arrest my design, when I consider the small proportion the Present carries to your Honours Greatness, till I call to mind, that Heaven it self delights to have her name sung though from the mouths of Infancy and Ig∣norance: and, that small things do oft ex∣plain the greatness of devotion; and though your Honours Piety, Charity, and Loyalty, (whereof the whole Fame of your Honours Countrey is but one entire Panagyrick) may render your Honour the Admiration of this Age, yet I here intend an Epistle, not an En∣comium, lest I betray the shallowness of my Judgment, in offering to draw an imperfect Coppy in a place where the Original can be its own Orator, and appear with so much Lustre.
It is from hence I receive my Encourage∣ment
to commit this Orphant to your Ho∣nours Protection: For, though it be already Legitimated and Licensed by the Right Re∣verend the Lord Bishop of London, yet I think it fit in these Seducing and Apostatising Times, to Patronage it with as much Virtue as I could, that under the name of two such God-Fathers, it might with less scruple pass for a good Christian.
I humbly therefore implore your Ho∣nours acceptance thereof from him who will be ever ready to approve himself an obedi∣ent Son of this Orthodox Church, and glo∣ry in nothing more, than in being by your Honour esteemed
