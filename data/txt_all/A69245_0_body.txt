RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL: It is not a new fashion, for such as pub∣lish any Bookes, whether of greater or lesser worth, to present them to some worthy Personages, for to be patroni∣zed, which howsoeuer it may be super∣fluous and vnfit at sometimes, and for some Bookes, yet it cannot but be very requisite and sit in this, both in respect of the Authour, and of his worke: For the Authour by Nation is a stranger, and the worke doubtlesse shall meete with many enemies: And therefore howso∣euer they are both of them of very great worth, yet both of them will haue neede of good countenance and defence. And as their necessitie in a forraine Region requires this; so their great worthi∣nesse and pious intention demaunds it, as a dutie, at the hands of all good men: for herein the scrupulous doubts, or rather the subtle and querilous questions and disputes of ouer-witty and audacious men, in very waighty points of Faith, are exquisitely discussed and resolued, to the pacifying no doubt of many vnsetled and vnquiet mindes in the Church of Christ, which are more ready to be in∣quisitiue
into deepe mysteries, then to beleeue them. Now then my selfe being vtterly obscure, and indeed altogether vnaccomplished for such a businesse, yet the Lot being fallen to mee to send this tran∣slation forth into the world; I had almost let it goe at all aduen∣tures, to receiue such entertainment as the world vsually affords vnto strangers, but that calling to minde your Worships great cour∣tesie and affabilitie, I thought they should not be vnwelcome vn∣to you: Besides, hauing a great desire to testifie the loue and much respect I beare vnto you; I imagined that I could not better doe it, then by intitling your Worships vnto so learned and holy a Trea∣tise, tending to the maintenance of Religion and Truth; because as one of your Names is honoured,
Emanuell Col∣ledge in Cam∣bridge, foun∣ded by Sir Walter Mild∣may. and that most worthily, by a fa∣mont and lasting Monument of loue vnto Learning, Religion, and Truth; so I rest assured, that by your patronage of this Booke, your Honourable fame shall be encreased; for which, and for all other blessings abundantly to be conferred vpon you, praying vnto al∣mighty God: I beseech your Worships to pardon the boldnesse, and to accept of the good will of him, who euer will rest most humbly
