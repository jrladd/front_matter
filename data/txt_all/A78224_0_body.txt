SIR,
I Forget not to pay the Honour left due unto your Ancestors. Your emulation of thir loyalty, and prowesse calls for an accompt from mee. Nor can I make a full
one without an euge to your inflection toward the royall Mine. Persist then, and be eternized in the justest cause of God and the King. You shall not loose in such zeale, nor I by the divine fuell that maintaines it. Both will be gainers. You may get enough, and J keep in store to fiâˆ£nish an everlasting monument. Thereto subscribing, I am ingaged before the World, and, delivering this to remember you, enabled to acquit my selfe

Iun. 2. 1643.
