SIR,
IF my own Genius had not prompted me, the Nature of this Discourse would have led me to You; being of the Acti∣ons of that ARMY, which (as it received the compleat actu∣ation of its Form, by the concurrence of the Right honourable the House of PEERES; so it) received its first rise from that Honourable House where you sit, and have sate as Speaker, (after an unparallel'd instance) for sixe con∣tinued Years together; deriving in the mean time, not so much wonder, as benefit to the King∣dome thereby: having, all along, by the same
 Publique Organ asserted the English freedome, whereby once (since the beginning of this Par∣liament) You answered His Majesty, (who had then after an unusual manner entred your House:) That you had neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, but what that Honourable House gave you. In all the warm Influences and Moti∣ons whereby this Army hath been cherished, You have been One in the Constellation, yea, a chief and leading One.
SIR, I mention not these things to lay a stumbling-block of Pride before you; But to minde you of that which I know you acknow∣ledge, That One greater then States, gave you this faithfulnesse. Now as for this Story Sir, what is wanting in it of Elegancie of Phrase, hath been endeavoured to be supplied in the truth of the Relation: And next to that, a good propor∣tion of my care hath been to carry it without such distatefull reflection, as might render it unfit for your Candor to patronize; I make no questi∣on but you will easily discern a thread of Divi∣nity running through the whole proceeding of this Army, and that their Actions have been no∣thing else, but a Copy of the Wisdom, Power, Pro∣vidence, and love of God put forth in men.
My Prayers for you, and the Honourable Senate are, That God who hath made all your Ene∣mies without, appear but flesh, and that flesh grasse,
 would save you from the power of flesh within, that you may act all things in the strength and excellency of that Spirit that hath wrought these things for ye, that ye may be partakers of as much of God as of Victory; whereby ye shall be sure, not only to arrive your selves laden with Honour, and all the sweet fruits of your unwearied Labours at the Port of glory, but shall also direct the tossed Bark of this Common-wealth towards the Haven of Rest and Righteousnesse.
SIR, In your publike merit many thousands are no lesse then I am, who am professedly,
Sir,
