The svveete singer of Israell in his heauenly composed hymes vseth oth to pray to god, & to praise od. I need not recomend vnto you

prayer I hope you vse it as I knovv you doe publikely soe I doubte no but you vse it also priuatly Preaching is gods speach to you Prayer is ours to him. Preaching belongs to me, I preach to you  your pastor, & pray for you also Prayer belongs to you to pray for me, your selfe, all yours, all go childreÌ„. For the manner hovve no better president, noe more perfect patterne, then S. Paulls practice  his prayers, vvhich I haue here metaphrased for you in the syllables of your ovvne mother tongue. Go the father is the objecte of your prayers, & prayses. God the sonne the presenter of them as the only master of requests in heauen. Go the holy ghost the very breath  your prayers, the simle of you soule. Vse this blessed exercise both

of prayer, & praise. Be in loue vvith it, & god vvill loue you. To vvhich loue of his in this modell of my best loue to you I recomend your vvell disposed thoughts in the sauing mercies of Christ Iesus your lord, & mine. Resting
