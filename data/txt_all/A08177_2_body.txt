F. Ainting with sorrow this my youngling Muse,
R. Equires as much of you for Delias death:
A. Teare : eyes, that are sorrowes ,
N. Euer drops one, for one so deare on earth,
C. Ould all your teares at once be dry distill'd,
I. Know you would not leaue one drop vnshead,
S. O deare you lou'd your Delia, wrapt in lead.
