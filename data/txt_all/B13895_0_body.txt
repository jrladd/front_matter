Right Honourable:
YOVR Sidneian bloud, and your famed fauour to now despised Poesie, challenge the dedicati∣on of these Epigrams Better then these, none yet haue put on an English habit: and ther∣fore deserue an Honorable Pa∣tron. Report deliuers of the Renowned Sidney (whose bloud you haue, whose vertues you inherite) that the most vnfiled worke, the poorest hand could offer vp, hee receiued with thanks, making the loue of the man, to supply the worth. My hope, if not beleefe, tells me, that your Lordship will doe the like by me, and graciously ac∣cept of this booke, which the loue of a poore man presumes to present vnto you. Read then, great
 Lord, and reading approue the workes of this no meane Poet, whom it can bee no dishonour to your Honour to protect. I conclude my Epistle with this prayer, that what is best for you in this world, you may enioy before, and aboue your wish, and that at last you may euerlastingly liue in that other world, whither the emulation of your Lordships vertues will lead a troupe of soules.
