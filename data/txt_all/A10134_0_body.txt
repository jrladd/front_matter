RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
WHat reading of holy Scripture and of Ecclesi∣asticall stories, what experience hath taught mee, of the Righteous mans Evils, and the Lords deliverances; that I preached to my Church at London in nine Sermons, which in this booke I have dedicated to your Honour, as an acknow∣ledgement of the heroicall and Christian vertues, which shine in your most Noble and Honourable person, and as an homage due to them; not as having any worthinesse and excellencie from their author, whereby he should presume to offer them to such a Lord, in whom all things excell in worth, and shine in a most eminent degree of excellencie.
In Empires, Kingdomes, States, Cities, Families, wee read and see the truth of the Oracle which said to ATTALVS King of Bithinia, THOU AND THY SON, NOT THE SONS OF THY SON. His Maiestie, who now holdeth the raines of this peaceable and flourishing kingdome, is the onely King knowne in the world by stories, who can reckon neere two thou∣sand yeeres since his roiall Ancestors, of whom he is lincally descended, wore Crownes and Scepters. In France they thinke it much, if a man can prove his Nobilitie by foure
Descents. Since three hundred and odde yeeres that SIR GILBERT HAMMILTON came from England to Scot∣land, was there advanced to all titles and degrees of honours, of dignities, of greatnesse among the most noble and honourable of the Realme by the HEROS of those dayes, and King without peere ROBERT BRVCE, who had knowne in England the antiquitie of his noble house, and of all men then living, could best iudge of his courage, martiall actes, and de∣serts; and being preferred there to the mariage of the onely Daughter to my Lord Earle of Murray, the Kings Nephew by his Princely Sister, became the Stocke of the illustrious Race of the HAMMILTONS in Scotland, whereof your Honour is the golden head; how many Descents, how many generations, may be reckoned?
The fables tell of BELLEROPHON, how after he had done many feates of armes, not so much by his owne wis∣dome and strength, as by the helpe of his winged Horse called PEGASVS, he waxed proud, and attempting with the same wings to mount up to heaven, was flung to the earth, and brake his leg: whereby they teach us in a mysticall sense, that many, after they have beene borne upon the wings of their Prin∣ces favour, and thereby have done good services, conceive too ambitious and proud hopes, and, as if favour were desert, aspi∣ring to ascend into heaven, to exalt their Throne above the rest of the starres, and to be like unto their Maker, are cut downe to the ground in an instant, where all their pompe is laid in a grave of shame and dishonour; as the Scripture speaketh of the King of Babylon, under the name of LVCIFER. In all the ancient stories hardly shall we finde any great man, whose prede∣cessors or himselfe have not beene stained with the blot of re∣bellion against their Soveraignes, or of some negligence of their dutie towards them: But your Honours forefathers had ever their affections so addicted to our Kings, that King IAMES the third, with the consent of the States, and applause of the whole Realme, thought them worthy to be rewarded with the mariage of his onely and deare Sister, whom he gave in wed∣locke
to IAMES Lord Hammilton, of whom your Lord∣ship is come by many lineall successions. This proximitie of blood to our Kings, hath ever beene to your Ancesters, and to your owne selfe, a most attractive Adamant, drawing and ty∣ing inseparably your hearts, desires, wills, affections, duties, and services to their will and desires in all innocencie and upright∣nesse, according to Gods commandement: the practice whereof is the stay of the State, and the maintainer of peace in the Church and Common-weale; FEARE GOD, AND THE KING; AND MEDDLE NOT WITH FACTIOVS MEN. So that this may be the Poesie of the Cognizance of your Honours most ancient and honourable Family, FIDEET OBSEQVIO.
Of this fidelitie, of these long, profitable, and acceptable services to our Kings, continued in your Lordships familie from generation to generation, and most effectually confirmed by your owne generous, wise and good cariage in the Court and in the State, the Kings Maiestie is a most glorious witnesse, and a most magnificent rewarder: For that affection which his Ma∣iestie sheweth to your Honour, those Dignities wherewith hee hath honoured you, namely this last of LORD STEW∣ARD of his royall House, what are they but publike testimo∣nies of the continuation of your good, faithfull and well liked services to his Maiesties Royall person, to our most excellent and hopefull Prince his Royall and onely Sonne, and to the states of both kingdomes? In the Court you are to his Maiestie that which IOSEPH was to PHARAO King of E∣gypt, OBADIAH to ACHAB King of Israel, MORDECAI to AHASVERVS King of Persia, and ELIAKIM, to whom God gave the key of the house of DAVID, to the good King EZECHIAH, and most like unto THEODORVS in the Court of VALENS Emperour of the Orient; who being come of a most ancient and noble stocke, and well brought up from the Cradle, was not in∣feriour to any of the Imperiall Court in modestie, wisedome, eru∣dition and good carriage, ever seemed better than the charges
and places whereunto he was advanced, and was the onely man whose tongue was never licentiously unbridled, never spake with∣out consideration and foresight, yea was never shut through feare of danger, or hope of preferment, and therefore was equally lo∣ved of great and small, as your Lp. for the same vertues is much respected and loved of all states and degrees in both nations: For, by Gods speciall and rare blessing, you carry your selfe in all your demeanour at Court and abroad so wisely, that I may boldly affirme, that to none, if not to you, doth belong that rare and wonderfull praise which Cicero giveth to BRVTVS, and Marcellin to PRETEXTATVS, saying, that they did no thing to please, yet whatsoever they did, pleased; and that other which all men gave to ANTHEMIVS Governour to the reli∣gious Emperour ARCADIVS, HE SEEMED TO BE WISE, AND SO HE WAS. The Royall Prophet David saith most truly in the twelfth Psalme, that wicked men walke on every side, when rascals are exalted among the sonnes of men: Then DAVID fleeth, and DOEG triumpheth. But innocencie is protected, oppression is repressed, the states flourish, kingdomes prosper, the people have peace; when gene∣rous and worthy men, who hate couetousnesse, flattery, and envy, who respect above all worldly things the honour of the King, who have no other end of their actions but the weal of the State, are neerest to Kings. DARIVS King of Persia, holding a Pomegranet in his hand, wished, in stead of all treasures, to have as many ZOPYRES as there were graines in that Apple: shewing, that there is nothing so needfull and profitable to Kings as faithfull Counsellers and servants of the chiefe of the No∣bilitie, such as ZOPYRVS was; and yet no Iewell so rare to be found: For though there be many nobles about Kings, there be few upon whose fidelitie, wisdome and magnanimitie Kings may relie. Therefore blessed is this Realme, wherein so many ZOPYRES, so many of the heads of the Nobilitie, are ever neere our most wise, religious and righteous Kings eares: A∣mongst whom your Honour shineth as a radiant Planet among the bright and glistering starres.

What are generositie, wisdome, faithfulnesse to the King, love to the native soyle, good and acceptable services to the State, but gorgeous and glittering sinnes, if they be severed from true godlinesse, from faith in our Lord IESVS CHRIST, from love to his beloved Church, from holinesse of life and good workes, acceptable to God? What are Courtiers, what are the Nobles of the Land, what are Kings themselves, without Christian vertues, but like a certaine people of Asia, which were wont to carry earthen vessels in golden Boxes? What are all their riches, honours, dignities, pleasures, pastimes, delights, but tri∣fles but faire vanishing bubbles, which must give place to things more solid, that bring to true beleevers an everlasting felicitie and ioy? For as the shell of an Egge, howsoever it bee white, smoothe, and well formed, must bee broken, that the Chicken may come out, and that, wherefore the shell was made, appeare: So the fashion and shew of this world must passe away, that the incomprehensible estate which God hath laid up, and keepeth in heaven for his deare ones, may shine and bee made manifest. Therefore where greatnesse and godlinesse, where wordly prero∣gatives and celestiall priviledges, where carnall and spirituall nobilitie, faith in Christ, and faithfulnesse to the King, love to the State, and charitie to the Church, a vehement passion for the common-weale and true zeale to God, are ioyned and ma∣ried together, as they are in your Honours person; every man that seeth them is bound to acknowledge, to admire, and to praise them, and to render all honour and serviceable duties to those whom God hath so mercifully & wonderfully honoured.
This then is the cause of the Dedication of these my Sermons to your Honour. For who shall blame me, if so far as in me is, I honour with my Penne a Lord, whom God hath sorichly honou∣red with his Gifts? And who shall denie, but that Sermons of the righteous mans evils, and of the Lords deliverances, may, yea should bee dedicated to a Lord, who though living in the midst of worldly contentments, eateth the Paschall Lambe, not onely with unleavened bread of sincerity & truth, but also with the bitter hearbes of godly sorrow, ever sighing, ever sobbing
before God for the affliction of Ioseph, ever praying, ever cry∣ing to heaven for the deliverance & restauration of Ierusalem lapping of the glib-sliding pleasures of this transitorie and fu∣gitive life, as GEDEONS souldiers lapped of the running wa∣ters, and tasting them with thanks-giving as temporall gifts of God, but drinking great draughts of teares flowing from the eyes of spirituall sadnesse, ever expecting with a most firme hope the accomplishment of the Prophecies by the ruine of Ba∣bylon, and deliverance of the Church; ever hastening & setting forward that necessary & glorious worke, by courageous and faithfull counsels, and all other meanes lawfull and possible.
I cannot omit that which toucheth my selfe: For being ba∣nished from France for the Gospell of Christ, and for my nations sake, and comming to his Maiesties Court, where like unto ENDIMION after his long sleepe, I saw nothing but new fa∣ces, and seemed to my selfe as a man fallen out of the Cloudes; your Honour embraced me with such kindnesse and humanitie, and recommended me to his Maiestie with such affection, that I should be iustly condemned of ingratitude, if I did ever forget it.
Let that foule vice goe and burie it selfe in the gulfe of hell where it was bred; I had rather be esteemed clownish and home∣bred, by rendring to your Honour, in these unpolished sheetes, such thankes as I can, than called unthankefull by neglecting of my dutie. The poore woman with her mite, was as acceptable to God, as the rich men with their rich gifts, because shee gave what she had with a free heart: And great Lords receive of their Vassals strawes, and trifles for homage of great tene∣ments. I doubt not but this small and unworthy hommage shall finde in your most worthy Lordship, the like acceptation; as com∣ming from one, who with a true heart, poures out his prayers to God for the increasing of all the blessings of this life, and of the life to come, upon your most honourable Person, and illustrious Familie, and who is
