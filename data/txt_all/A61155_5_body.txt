Brethren,
THese are the sig hings of some of your own spirits under Epis∣copacy, under the Tyranny of that government. O how acute and sensible were your Iudgements and Consciences then of the usurpation, dominion, imposed Formes, when you were the sufferers! but now that your Brethren are become the Non-conformists to you, as you were Non conformists to the Prelates; and you the imposers, and your Brethren the sufferers; I find times and conditions are forgotten, and yoakes are called for which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare. I see by your printings and preachings the working of new dispo∣sitions in you, and Symptomes of something like Dominion and Persecution; surely Brethren your crying out thus for the civill power to help you or all is undon, is a sign you trust not to the Gospel strength, nor truth of you way, but to the arme of flesh. Methinks of late your Sun is turning into darknesse and blacknesse over us, and your Moon into bloud: is it possible that yoakes, burthens, whips, prisons, banish∣ments, can be soon forgotten? Can Saints like naturall men see their faces in a glasse, and so soon forget what manner of men they were?
I have reasoned with you in your own arguments; I hope your own arguments may find accesse to your spirits when ours cannot; men are sooner perswaded by their own reason then anothers. O that the same sounding of bowels may be heard in you to your Brethren, that ye wished to heare in others who were once your task-masters! What Joseph said in his affliction, we shall say to you, Think on us I pray you when it shll be well with you, and shew kindnesse; for it may be as Mor∣decai said, ye are come to the Kingdom for such a time as this; if not, enlargement and deliverance shall arise from another place.
