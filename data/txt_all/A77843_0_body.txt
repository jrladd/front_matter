HONORABLE;
HOwsoever the feare of God be not thought necessary to human Judges by men of the world, yet the Scrip∣ture doth much presse it, Exod. 18.21. 2 Chron. 9.7. Yea, some Heathens have acknowledged the neces∣sity of it, therefore amongst the Ancients the court of Judgement was neare the Temple, that so the reverence of their gods might bend the minds of
Judges to Justice. And they report that in Aethio∣pia, the Judges sitting in their Court, leave twelve seats in the highest place empty, which (they say) are the Angels seats. Therefore he was the unjust Iudge in the Parable, that did not feare God, nor re∣spect man; Such an one was Agesilaus, who wrote to a Captain for a prisoner in these words; Re∣lease Nicias the prisoner without faile; for if he have not offended, in Iustice you are to dismisse him; but of he have hainously offended, and deserved punishment, then dismisse him for my sake. Here he mingled pri∣vate affections in publick administrations, which is very sinfull. Therefore that you may avoid such rocks, especially consider, that Argument of the Scripture, It is the Iudgement of the Lord; Iudicium Dei est, (saith a Schoolman) ideo Iudex in tribus Deo debei conformari, in potestate, in bonitate, & in veri∣tate; It is the Iudgement of the Lord; therefore the Judge ought to resemble God, while he judgeth in power, in goodnesse, and in truth. All which if you doe, the Kingdome may be freed from guilt, truth and peace may kisse each other, and you deliver your own soules; Which is the ear∣nest prayer of him who desires to serve you in the Lord;
