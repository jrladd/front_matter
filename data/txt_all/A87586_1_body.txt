Madams,
WEre I not in awe of your Humility, which though it selfe publisheth the glory of your graces, yet commands me silence, I might have given the world a tast of that, which in these holinesse-contemning dayes would not have been relished, but distast∣ed, yet thus much I am constrained to say, that I cannot but look on you both, as an honour each to the other, the Mother to the Daughter and the Daughter to the Mother, and both as the Rachels of the true Church of God, and beautifull spouse of Christ, who do daily preach by example, what in this Manuall I have written with my pen: So that if any would know, what kinde of Christians I would have in this sick∣ly season, let them cast their eyes on your virtues, as the best pictures I can draw, to hold out my meaning to the world. Such is your piety, mixed with prudence and humility, that you deserve a never dying name amongst those honorable women, (in the sacred Heraldry) which believed also, and received the word with all readinesse of mind,Acts. 17.12. and searched the Scriptures daily, whether things were so; Pious po∣verty is a head of gold on feet of clay, but your devout Nobility is like Apples of gold in pictures of silver. Its honour upon honour, when ter∣rene honour is gilt with celestiall graces: amongst which let me name (without flattery) these two as most honorable and seasonable, your Christian Sympathy and Religion-adorning humilitie. The maine ground, why I am so bold to present this little Treatise (called Parlia∣ment physick for a sin-sick Nation) to your Ladiships, is, because you are the exemplary peeces of my following discourse, hoping that you will be pleased to favour that draught which is so like your noble selves, whose dayly taske it is, not onely to help forward a nationall reformation, but also, and that in the first place, a personall, in your sin-sick selves, both which you shall finde urged in this Treatise, deare La∣dies,
if this poor tribute of my Physicall studies may but kisse your hands, as a sacrifice offered by your servant, or as a weaknesse that standeth in need of your protection (for I look to be censured as a State Emperick) I shall acknowledge my self not onely much honoured, but also secured, at a distance, from my Noble Colonell, and much honoured Governour of Lincolne, under whose Buckler, many of these truthes have been taught by me, and manfully defended by himself, both by strength of argument, and dint of sword: for whose fidelity, fortitude and good successe, not onely you and yours, but also the Church of God have cause, as to pray, so to praise the Lord of Hosts, who hath made him an instrument of much good in the Parliament service, both to King and Kingdom. Much might be said in way of commendation, but lest my words might seeme to know flattery, I will conclude with a word of exhortation; Trust God with Sir Miles Hobart abroad, and take a sweet nap in the lap of Providence at home, for Divinity and experience say, that no bullet can touch him; without a Divine com∣mission. For whom I shall alwayes pray, and rest,
