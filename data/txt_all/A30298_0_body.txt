May it please Your Grace,
TO pardon the Presum∣ption of one of the Clergy of Your late Diocess, and of Your present Province, in this Address; one who had never the honour to see your Person, but in your
 Episcopal Visitation, where he observ'd, with a mixture of Contentment and Admiration, the Humility, Condescention, and Paternal Tenderness to your Clergy; when you might have come with a Rod, you chose to visit us in Love, and the Spirit of Meekness; by which you subdu'd every Heart to Obedience, and com∣manded all our Acknowledg∣ments. But, my Lord, you have a more especial Title to these Papers from your Piety and Charity, which are their Argument: Of both which (even then when you were but a private Presbyter in the Church) you gave so large a Specimen in your own Parish,
 and in dangerous Times, that it remains as a lasting Monu∣ment, and a sufficient Testi∣mony of what you durst then, and what you will do still for the Support of that Church of which you are deservedly now the Chief Member. And we have all the reason in the World to congratulate your Advancement to the Archi∣episcopal Throne, (as the Anci∣ents use to call it) not so much for your Happiness as our own. And so much the more, when we remember that we are un∣der the Care of such a Leader, who is an Example to us all, in Word, in Conversation, in Cha∣rity, in Faith, and in Purity. One, who (having regularly
 past through all the Degrees of the Clergy to the highest Place in the Church) knows the Nature and Circumstances of all its Members, and con∣sequently will take all occasi∣ons to encourage the Inferior as well as Superior Parts of that August Body: The poor Curates (that do the whole Re∣ligious Duties sometimes of great Parishes for small Sti∣pends) and the poorest Vicars, (dis-spirited and dispossess'd of the ancient Demesns of their Churches, and forc'd with their Families to live upon the Tythes of Mint, Anise, and Cummin, &c,) as well as the Reverend Dignitaries, or o∣thers of larger Revenues.

And, in a word, when we re∣member that You are not only a prudent and careful Governor, but a skilful Pilot, who will omit no Diligence or Oppor∣tunities to Steer the late tossed Ship of our Church amongst so many Rocks and Waves, private and publick Enemies, into the Haven of Prosperity and Peace. To which the Au∣thor, in his present Circum∣stances, can only contribute these his Papers and his Prayers; who is,
My LORD,

From Little Gaddesden in the County of Hertf. March 12. 1695.
