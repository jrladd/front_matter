SIR,
BEfore I pay my Debt to Nature, I would willingly discharge the Debt I owe to your so many Civili∣ties and Favours. And I should then Depart well pleas'd; could I leave something to shew, That I have Lived; And a Testimony that I Died with the Honour of being knowne Your Servant. How farre These few MOTTETS (which I here humbly present you) will contribute to the Ambition of my Designe; the Modesty of an Old Man, alwayes distrusting his owne Compositions, may make him suspect: Which yet cannot but find a Pardon, if not a Patronage from a Soule so Harmonious as Yours. However the Offer is Pious, and the Adventure Noble, that I should Dare to put a Spirit (for the Note is That by which they Breath) into the Words of Excellent Sandys: Words so Pure and Proper, as that David Himself would have sung them with Joy: I might without Prophanation have spoke higher. And had the Church of England but the Happiness to receive into Her Assemblies Those Psalms Thus Translated; Her Enemies long before this would have turn'd their Scorn into Envy, and Witty Atheists their Scoffs into Admiration. I am sure the Prudent Worshipper of God, in stead of Scandal, had receiv'd Delight. I complain not of all; Some I confess are Tolerable. In the mean time I am among Those, who Mourn to see, These transcendently Holy Raptures even in Publick Worship exposed to so much Scandal and Scorn. I could not say less to Advance the Subject of my Mottets: Nor can I speak too much to Excuse the Meanness of the Composition: yet, having followed the Grounds of an Art by me studied more then 50 years, something in These may prove not unwor∣thy of Your Eye: though the Author has at present little else to bring him forth from Obscurity, then the Honour He hopes to receive of being acknowledged,
Sir,
