Much honored Ladies:
IT is too true a saying, that Greatnes, and

Goodnesse sel∣dom go together; for not many mighty, not ma∣ny noble are cal∣led. Yet (bles∣sed be God, for his mercies to you-wards) wee finde both of these, in both of you. For your Greatnesse (next

under God) yee are beholding un∣to your Parents, out of whose loynes you came. For your Good∣nesse, yee are in in some measure beholding unto Affliction, by which The Lord hath done you good: so as I make

no question but that ye may both of you say with David, It is good for mee that I have beene afflicted. Hereupon (wor∣thy Ladies) I have adventured to put forth this small Treatise, touching the Ne∣cessitie, and utility

of Affliction, un∣der your Ladi∣ships names, and Patronage: joyn∣ing you both to∣gether, because God hath alrea∣dy conjoyned you so neere in af∣finity, by the mar∣riage of your Pi∣ous and Religi∣ous children: be∣seeching

your Ladyships to ac∣cept of these my poore labors, be∣ing such as tend to the furthe∣rance, and in∣crease of your comfort in pre∣sent, or future trials. For all∣beit yee bee good proficients in the

School of Affli∣ction; Yet (per∣adventure) yee may have forgot∣ten some good lessons which Af∣fliction hath for∣merly taught you; or else have not attained (as yet) to that good, wherein it may hereafter instruct

you. To help you in either, or both of these, be pleased (I hearti∣ly beseech your Ladiships) seri∣ously to peruse, what is here ten∣dered unto you: and then I doubt not, but (by Gods blessing) yee shall be able

to make that good use of Af∣fliction, that yee shall not only blesse God, the Father of mer∣cies, and God of all comfort (who as hee hath affli∣cted, so hath hee comforted you, in all your tribu∣lations) but yee

shall also be able to comfort o∣thers, which are in Affliction, by the cōfort where∣with yee your selves have been comforted of God. Which fruit that yee may reape, I shall sow my Prayers before


throne of Grace, and for ever rest,

Cranham.
