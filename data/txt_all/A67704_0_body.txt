MY LORD,
THE Presumption would be too great, should I offer a Work of less esteem than this of Xenophon's to a Person of your

Lordship's Quality and Honou But as all Ages past have given a Universal Testimony of their valu for this Wise Book: so I hav reason to believe all to come, wi as generally approve my Choice  your Lordship for its Patron. Fo who so fit to desend the Cyru that was design'd a Pattern fo Princes and Great men to imitate, as one so remarkably eminent for Loyalty? Whose De∣scent is from a Race of Kings whose Education has been agree able to so high a Birth, and, wha is yet more rare, whose Virtue fully answer both. This I may say without being suspected for flattery, that no one has made a nearer approach than your Lord∣hip

to this Character of Perfecti∣n in general, and that none has qualled your Lordship in that articular Part which consists in Candour and Forgiveness. 'Tis his, my Lord, which has hard∣ed me to the boldness of this Ad∣ress, which I hope your Lord∣hip will Pardon from
My Lord,
