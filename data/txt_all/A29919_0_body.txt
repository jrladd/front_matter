Honourable Mistrisse:
IT hath ever been a custome in dedicating labours to great Personages, to present such matter as may seeme (as it were) in affinity with the mind to whom it is offe∣red, fitting it as Comicke Poets do their enterludes, to make them be plausibly heard of the whole audito∣ry,
 and herein have I strived to shape my subject to the affection of so Honorable a Patronesse, as your self, to whom I dedicate this rude peece; which I could have wished might have been undertaken by a more able workman, that our nation might not be de∣prived of that commodity, which other countries sur∣feit of; and I was the more encouraged in this re∣solve, that I might shew my gratitude to your self, whose many favours (though I come far short of de∣serving) yet J have alwaies been ambitious, in en∣deavouring to expresse an acknowledgement. And though I cannot come in so full a current as my de∣sires would offer, yet such as my murmuring streams produce, I here present; resolving to expose this in∣fant to the light of your judgement to be tried; & not hold him for legitimate till you approve him. Vouch∣safe therefore to shroud under your protection this un∣pollisht worke, which I offer not as a present whereby I pretend to oblige you, but as a homage I owe you, whereby to acquit my self of the first act of venerati∣on; as for me I find in your favour all I seek for; and having you on my side, I care not what malicious envy can do; having once your testimony, I can easily slight her calumnies; and though all her tongues were joy∣ned together, yet can she say nothing against me, ha∣ving
 your Honorable approbation: to whom I pro∣test so much respect, as that I may say without flatte∣ry, (complements being below the dignity of your stile) that you want much of that J wish you, if you want any thing of absolute felicity. And therefore the marks I herein cheifly aimed at, was not any vain hope of praise to my selfe (which how little I hereby deserve I am not so weake but to perceive) but to leave a te∣stimony to my Country how much I desire her benefit, and to your self how much I am bound to remain
