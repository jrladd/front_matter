My Lord,
IT was your pleasure to put the Service of Preaching at this Election upon me; and it is your common desire to have that brought to your eyes, which lately was presented to your ears: Assuredly, I neither value my self nor this Sermon at that rate, as to make it thus publike; what is now done, is onely to express my due respects unto your strong commands, for such I do interpret your desires of Printing this Sermon to be: It is now no longer mine, but yours; For you I studied it, to you and the City I Preached it, at your request I publish it, and to all of you I humbly offer it; and be you pleased to remember, that Verba Dei sunt vivenda.

I have little else to say unto you in way of Epistle, onely this, You are a City upon a Hill, the whole Kingdom looks upon you, and are apt to move as your Orb moves, all Publique Places and Persons are exemplary: You have been famous for your Piety, for your Charity, for your Fidelity, for your Vnity; Give me favor to apply unto you those words which Christ delivered unto the Church of Thyatira, I will put upon you no other burthen, but that which you have already, hold fast; Per∣severance in well doing, is one step further in the path of Duty, and the very next step to Glory; continue therefore in the love of God, in the obedi∣ence of his Truth, in zeal for his Glory, in regard to his Servants, in Peace amongst your selves, and in one Vnited Heart for the Publique good; This will be your Honor in life, your Comfort in death, your Crown for ever: For this above all, you shall have the choycest of his desires unto the Father of mercies, who is,
