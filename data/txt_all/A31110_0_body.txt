My Lord,
WHen I Preach'd this Sermon at your Invitation before your Lordship and the Court of Aldermen, whatever fault was in it was imputable wholly to my self: But now that I Publish it by your Lordships and their Order, you will pardon me if I tell you, you have made your selves sharers in the Blame. Yet I must needs say, had I bin convinc'd there was any thing in it that justly deserv'd Censure, I should not easily have bin prevail'd with to expose it to Publick view, unalter'd as it is. But such is my Unhappiness, that though I have bin told that many were offended at it, yet I have not met with any one that knew a good Reason why, or that was himself perswaded there was any Reason for it. The onely Passage I have heard of (tho' there may be many more for ought I know) that gave so much Offence, is that toward the Conclusion wherein I express my detestation of such a Wickedness as the inviting in the French would be, in an English-man and a Protestant. I am not yet perswaded that the declaring my Ab∣horrence
of it in the manner that I have done, is so much as a tacit accusing any Person of it: Neither can I think that I have aggra∣vated the Crime in an undue manner, when I make it next to the worst that can be imagin'd. But if any one will tell me of a grea∣ter that ought to come between, I shall not be backward to acknow∣ledge such a Mistake. Neither lastly, can I think it worth my while to answer such a weak and peevish Objection as some I hear have made, as if it were Blasphemy forsooth to suppose that wick∣ed men may account the Government of Almighty God a Tyranny. And yet if nothing of all this be the Fault that is to be found in that Expression, I must needs say, I am yet to seek where it lyes. In composing of the Sermon it was my real desire to promote as well as I could the great End for which the Day was set apart, viz. Re∣pentance and Reformation whereby the Judgments of God might be prevented. And I am not out of hope that it may have had, and may yet have by virtue of this Publication, some little Effect that way. And therefore I humbly present it to your Lordship as a Testimony that I am
My Lord,
