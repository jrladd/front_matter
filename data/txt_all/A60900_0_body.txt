SIR,
THE Noble Favours and Encourage∣ments you have vouchsaf'd me, Me∣rit more than the tender of this Poem; which craves Protection under the sha∣dow of your Name; and though (as to its style) it may seem much beneath your Judgment and Acceptance, and I consequently judged Guilty of Presumpti∣on and Arrogance: yet as I owe you a just Service, and wou'd publish it: I less fear the Censure of Vain-glory and Conceited∣ness, than of Ingratitude. He that doth but tacitly resent the Candour of a true Friend, in a manner buries it: When he
that Proclaims it may in some measure seem to make some shadow of Requital, tho' not Restitution. Were it not for this Considera∣tion, I might have exposed these Labours to the Criticism and Comment of an Age, in which are too many, who undervalue most things, because they are common; and many things because they are Sacred, and savour of Divine Vertue and Good∣ness: However, if I have your kind Inter∣pretation; I fear not the rigid one of the Times. They beg your Courteous Aspect, which if afforded, you no less Crown and Honour them, than him who in all Hu∣mility is,
