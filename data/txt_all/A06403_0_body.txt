MY LORD, when I make a dedication of some wri∣ting of mine, it is not for to follow the common and ordinarie proceedings of other writers: but onely because J see such a deed to haue beene ef∣fected by the Euangelist S. Luke, which dedicated his writings to
that great man, most Honorable Theophilus. The certainty wher∣of doth manifestlie appeare about the beginning of his Gospell, as also in the entrance of his other booke, commonly called, The Acts of the Apostles. And now I dedicate these my Conclusions vpon dances to your Lordship, because I was once moo∣ued to speake of them in your Lord∣ships companie: which matter I could not then handle so pertinently in speach, as I can at this time in ink and paper. Thus in London, with my praier to God for you, my Lord, the 23. of Nouember. 1606.
