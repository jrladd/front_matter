Worthy Sir,
BEfore I proceed farther, let me crave par∣don
of your Worship, for these my bold at∣tempts in presuming to Dedicate these my
weak Labours to your Worship, to whom di∣stance
of place hath now almost made a
stranger; but considering that Ingenuity of Spirit that was
once in your Father, & flourisheth in you who are the Branch
of so Noble a Root, together with the antient Familiarity that
was between your Father and mine, imboldned me after I
had converted a few idle hours into Study, and having
brought forth to birth what then I conceived, I present it
at your Worships feet: I hope there is nothing in it unbe∣seeming
the name of Culpeper; if there be failings in it they
are no more then what we are all subject to. The Ingenuity
of your Worship, I know to be such, that you will not onely
passe by my boldness in dedicating it to you, for that Objecti∣on
our Alliance in blood may take off,
Sigenus amborum scindit se sanguine ab uno.
Besides, as your ingenuity is Operative, which the Bowels of
all your poore Neighbours daily blesse God for, which you
are commended for, even where you are not known, and is

is no small joy to mine (your poore Kinsmans) heart, so shall
you be eternally rewarded for it another day, blessed is he
that remembreth the poor, your Worship knows well e∣nough
what follows. I hope your Worship will expect no
Flattery in the Epistle, there being none in the booke: if
you accept the Book, I shall thinke my selfe happy, and I am
confident those of our blood will hardly degenerate; it was
a notable expression of Plato, O Knowledge, how would
men love thee, if they did but know thee! for as Health
is the conservation of the Body, so is knowledge the
conservation of the Soul. Though it hath been neer upon
fifteen years since I saw your Worship: yet have I often
heard of you, both by Master Thomas Culpeper and Ma∣ster
Whitfield, who are both of our kindred, as by many o∣thers
more, and I heare your vertues increase daily more and
more, the Lord encrease them till the time of your change
come: and though we live in such an Age which calleth
Good Evill, and Evill Good, which takes Vice for Vertue
and Vertue for Vice, which think they strike at the Devill
and hit God, yet your Worship knows as well as I can tell
you, & better too, being no stranger to the writings of Phi∣losophers,
what Plato said of Vertue and Vice: quoth he,
If Vertue could take a bodily shape, shee would be so
beautifull a creature, all men would be in love with her,
(of which your Worship is one) also if Vice could take a
bodily shape, shee would be such an Ugly beast, all
men would hate her: for if Drunkards have so many
Apish and beastly postures, what would Drunkennesse
it selfe have if it were Visible? and yet that is but an Attri∣bute
of Vice neither.
I know very well, and my Genius prompts me to it, what
an excellent love your Worship beares to Learning, & truly
I might make another reason of that for Dedicating these

my weak labours to your Worship, as knowing the brightnes
of your brain will dissipate the clouds of my Ignorance: the
truth is, there arose a Question within my selfe whether I
should dedicate it to your Worship or not, but that contest
held not long, for I doubted not of your favourable accep∣tance,
for I knew well enough what failed on my part in
the performance of the worke, or what other imperfections
you could find in the booke, should be most Nobly censured,
and like your selfe: then presently I proceeded, and stampt
your Worships name upon it, that it may be said, in despight
of the proudest carper in the world, it is the Godchild of a
peerlesse Godfather. Sir, one thing more I must intreat you,
for I doubt I have been so bold, your VVorship will thinke
I flatter, and that I know your VVorship hates, as well as
my selfe; if there happen any thing in the booke, which
your VVorship cannot understand, I know you will say as
noble-minded Chion did, Let my betters judge of these
matters. I must confesse the thing is a worke of worth if
well understood, else your VVorship had not had it presented
to you, your worship knowes very well, and far better then
I can tell you, that knowledge requires the whole circuit of
a mans life, even from the terminus à quo to the terminus
ad quem; and the longer a man lives the more he may
learne. I am briefe, for tis brevity your VVorship delights
in, therefore to use many words I account it needlesse: your
VVorships friendly acceptance of it shall be such a favour
to me as I shall never forget (indeed I have so much the
blood of Culpeper in me that I cannot) what such as are al∣together
unlearned or proudly learned, speak against, I shall
take to be a badge of a weake, or stubborn braine, rather
than any blemish at all to the worke. I know your worship
will judge like your selfe, to whom I make bold to present
this as a memoriall of those former favours not unknowne

to your worship which passed between your Father and
mine; Lastly, before I conclude let me intreat one favour of
your worship, if I have mistaken in, or robbed you of any of
your titles of honour, I beseech you pardon
