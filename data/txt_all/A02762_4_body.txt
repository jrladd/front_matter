IF one Deuill loos'd so tortur-tosse the minde,
If Princes ire so vexe with thousand cares:
If crosses here, so fill men with despaires:
If so with tooth-ach, stone gowt, they are pin'd,
If here sterne conscience gnawing worme so grind,
What sorrowes then in Wraths infernall caues,
With matchlesse might shall wound all Satans slaues?
To blacknes, darknes, endlesse woe confi'd?
More, O! but when great iudgements voice shall sound
That last retreat, neuer to meete againe.
Me think's I heare what shout's, what shrick's in vaine
They bellow forth, to see the Saints so crown'd,
Amongst the best, Sir, this shall be your crowne,
To mount with these, when those shall be cast downe.
