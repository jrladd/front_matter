I Haue recei∣ued youre let∣ters (ryght reve¦rende & my ve¦ry good Lord) the .xxvi. daye of May .1558. in vvhich, you declare your a¦bondaūt good∣nes not only to me, in takyng my trauei∣les of my Prognosticatiō and Almanack vvhiche I sent you, in the best parte: but also to all men, vvhan you vvyshed thē to cum forth as a vvarning to corect and

amende their ill lyfe, and dissembling trade▪ and vvhere as your excellency af∣firmith, that thinges forseen may be alte∣rid, or at the leest the malice of them mi∣tigatid, and that the sicknes and infirmi∣ties of this yeare folovvyng, be diuers in their kynde, dangerous, mortal, and vni∣uersally reigning: for vvhiche men shall scant haue time to counsell vvith the ler∣nyd doctors, and maisters of Phisicke. VVherfore to shovv my dutie, and hū∣ble seruice vnto you at this tyme, I haue at youre requeste, deuised a treatyse, in vvhiche I haue touched the diseases, and maladies, vvhiche shall spring the yeare of .1559. and .1560. vvith the preser∣uation from them: and the curyng such as shalbe troubled vvith any of them. And if I shall deserue any prayse, and laude of the commō people for my la∣bour, I vvill they giue all that to youre honour, vvhiche are the only occasion of this enterprise. And if there shall any fault be founde in this booke, let them

ascribe that to the difficultie of the vvorke, and not to my negligence. Thus I leue to trouble your Lordshyppe any longer, vvilling suche as vvill take pro∣fit by my labour, to haue my medicines vvell made by the helpe of good and ler¦nyd Apothecaries. And suche as may haue the lernyd doctours and maisters of Physick, I vvyshe that they leue my booke, and folovv their counsel, not spa∣ryng anye expence: For lyfe is more of value, thē mony, or treasure. (For I make my boke for ther cause vvhiche can not haue the lernyd vvith thē.) God sende your excellency, long life, bodely helth, and in∣crease of honor.
At Salō, in the prouince of Craux, the .xii. of August. 1558.
