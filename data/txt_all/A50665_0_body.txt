Worthy Sirs,
HAving formerly had several Doubts and Quaere's in my minde, upon some particu∣lar Cases which oftentimes come in question betwixt Land-Lords and their Tenants, and being desirous to satisfie my self in those points; I thereupon made it my Study and Re∣creation at some spare hours to search and collect some choice Cases, (out of the Reports and other Works of seve∣ral Learned and Grave Judges, and other Sages of the Law) touching the Covenants, Conditions, Grants, Pro∣visoes, Reservations, Exceptions, Sur∣renders, Assignments, and many other things concerning Leases; as also

touching Distresses, Rescous, Avow∣ries, Replevins, Waste, and other matters often coming in debate be∣tween Land-Lords and their Te∣nants, as appears in the several Chap∣ters hereafter in this small Treatise. Which little Manual at the first un∣dertaking was intended onely for pri∣vate use, and a Vade mecum for my own Pocket; but having since com∣municated it to some special Friends and knowing Gentlemen, they have been very importunate with me for the publishing of it; at whose requests (they being my very intimate Friends and Acquaintance) I have now adven∣tured this small imperfect Treatise to the publick view. If it finde Ac∣ceptance it will be much Satisfacti∣on to him who is,
Gentlemen,
