IF to admire Worth and Honour were a Crime, it would highly con∣cern me to beg your Lordships pardon for the presumption of this Ad∣dress. For that's the Cause,

this the Effect. It is true, the obscurity of my Con∣dition, and remoteness of my Scituation, have plac'd me out of the reach of your Lordships Knowledge; yet your Lordships Fame Ecchoing out of Oxford-shire through all the very Cor∣ners of the Kingdom, could hardly escape my Ears, were I not particularly entitled to the same Coun∣ty, which hath given me thereby the greater op∣portunity both to know, and admire the Greatness of your Generosity, the Magnificence of your Li∣ving, and Prudence of your

Governing, accompanied with all other Qualificati∣ons and Endowments re∣quisite to render any per∣son both Great and Good: As also, that though your Lordship is a great impro∣ver of your own natural parts by your elaborate stu∣dies, and of others Know∣ledge by your Edifying Conversation; yet to ob∣viate Idleness, and to anti∣dote Sickness, as also the better to enapt your active Body to suit your Loyal Mind for Martial Employ∣ments, should the concerns of your King and Country call you forth into the Field,

your Lordship is a most in∣defatigable user of all active Sports and Recreations, and consequently become the great Oracle and Master of them all, and all their Artful Terms. Under what other Wing then could this little Treatise on those Sub∣jects so properly creep for shelter and Protection? Under no other certainly, without some kind of In∣justice to your Lordship, and real Injury to the Work it self. Be pleased therefore a little to unbend your Thoughts (I humbly be∣seech your Lordship) from your more serious Studies,

allowing your Eyes to run over these few Leaves, and either vouchsafe to correct their Errours, (if any have escaped those Judicious Sports-men who have been pleased to be my Guides in perusing this Work, and purging it from many Errors and Mistakes of the former Edition) or stamp them with the unquestionable au∣thority of your Lordships Approbation. This will ob∣lige all true Lovers of the same generous Recreations to become greedy purcha∣sers of these Rules, both to improve their Knowledge, and reduce their Language

to the same significant terms, to the great satisfaction of the Buyers, and the benefit of Proprietor and Seller, who humbly craves leave to lay himself at your Lord∣ships Feet, in the quality of
(May it please your Lordship)
