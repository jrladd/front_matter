MADAM,
MAy this discourse appear as gracious in your eyes, as it lately seemed pleasing and accept∣able to your ear. I shall not be∣shrew my self of my folly in let∣ting it walk abroad, & giving it leave to take the fresh air. Ma∣dam, my obligations from you are very many, & the comforts which I have hither to enjoyed under you (ever since I first took Sanctu∣ary in your family) not a few: I
 have lived to see many wave∣ings & tossings in other mens for∣tunes and conditions, whilest I my self have laid at anchor, and en∣joyed the sweetness of a secure re∣tirement, and have been sheltred from those storms and tempests which have lighted heavy upon many. This priviledge, next under God, I do humbly acknowledge to be owing to your Honour; and the remembrance hereof affects me with the sense of a great Obliga∣tion; and this forces my modesty, and puts me upon the necessity of returning (though nothing pro∣portionable,
 yet at least) some∣what in way of acknowledge∣ment as a pledge and testimony of my thankfulnesse. And to let your Honour see how ambitious I am to be accounted gratefull, I have adventured to do that now against which I ever had the greatest aversation: which is, to appear in Print. And though what I here present you with, be no wayes worthy your eye; yet having been lately honoured with your ear, it is ever since grown proud, and will needs be gadding abroad, and see the fa∣shions
 of the world, with resolu∣tions (according as it likes it's en∣tertainment) to bring more of it's fellows after it. But, Madam, I must remember that it is but a very small discourse which I here present you with, and I must not widen the gates be∣yond the proportion of the Ci∣tie; I doe therefore most hum∣bly offer it into your Honours hands, and if you please cast it at your feet; and in case you shall think so favourably of it, as to vouchsafe it now and then the Honour of your eye, and admit
 it graciously into your presence, it will reckon it self highly graced and dignified, and not ambitiously desire any other patronage. And howbeit (I confess indeed) it is not so properly calculated for your Family and relati∣ons, (whose Loyalty hath been abundantly tryed in the Fur∣nace, and have come forth glorious and shining) yet I (am proud to conceive) it may be of some Use to others, and if but to one, it is enough. And thus recommending both
 it to the favour of your gracious acceptance, and your self and most excellent relations to the prote∣ction and blessing of God Al∣mighty, for a continuance of his comforts to you here, and a full consummation of perfect joy and happiness hereafter, I do humbly take my leave of you, and rest
MADAM,
