My Lord,
THIS Collection of some of the scattered Copies of Verses, com∣posed in various and perplexed times, by Edward Lord Herbert your late Grand-father, belongs of double right to your Lordship, as Heir and Executor: And had it been in his power t' have bequeath∣ed his Learning by Will, as his Library and personal Estate, it may be presumed, he would have given it to you, as the best Legacy:

But Learning being not of our Gift, though of our Acquisition, nor of the Parapharna∣lia of a Ladies Chamber, nor of the casual and fortunate Goods of the World; it must be acknowledged of a transcendency beyond natural things, and a beam of the Divinity: For by the powers of Knowledge Men are not only distinguished from Men, but carried above the reach of ordinary Persons, to give Reasons even of their Be∣lief; not that Men believe because they know, but know because they believe; Faith must precede Knowledg; and yet Men are not bound t' accept matters of Religion (though Religion be th' object and employment of Faith, not of reasoning) meerly without Reason and probable Induce∣ments.
That the learned Centuries are past, and Learning in declension, is too great a truth,

which may introduce Atheisme with Igno∣rance; for as Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion amongst the Papists, so 'tis the Mother of Atheisme amongst th' Ignorant; The great and most dangerous design of our Church and National Enemies, is to make us out of love with Learning, as a Mecha∣nick thing, and beneath the Spirits of the Nobility and of Princes: Whereas nothing improves and inlightens th' understandings of great Persons, but Learning, and not on∣ly innobles them far above their birth, but inables them t' impose on others, and to give, rather then take advice: The Learn∣ed, Generous, and Vertuous Person needs no Ancestors; And what can so properly be call'd ours, as what is of our purchase? Gentiles agunt sub nomine Christiano, was an old Reproach upon the Primitive Christians, and now Men out-act the Gen∣tiles.
The Goods of this life are all Hydropick, Quo plus bibuntur, plus sitiuntur, Men are the dryer for drinking, and the poorer for covetousness; no satiety, no fulness, but in spiritual things: The way of Vertue ap∣peared to th' Heathen to be th' only way to Happiness, and yet they knew not many Vertues which are the Glory of Christianity, as Humility, Denying of our selves, Taking up the Cross, Forgiving and loving our E∣nemies, which th' Heathen took for follies rather then Vertues.
As for Poetry it bears date before Prose, and was of so great authority with the com∣mon People and the wiser sort of Antiquity, that it was in veneration with their sacred Writ, and Records, from which they derived their Divinity and belief concerning their Gods, and that their Poets, as Orpheus, Linus, and Musaeus were descended of the

Gods, and divinely inspired, from th' ex∣traordinary Motions of their Minds, and from the Relations of strange Visions, Ra∣ptures and Apparitions.
My Lord, Excuse the liberty of this De∣dication, and believe me,

March 18. 1664/5.
