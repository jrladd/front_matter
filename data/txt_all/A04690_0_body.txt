SIR, Amongst all the sinnes, that humane nature doth stand pos∣sest with, ingratitude, doth challenge a pro∣pertie in man, although it bee a thing repugnant to reason, and disa∣greeing with all mutuall focietie. To free myselfe from this vitium naturae, I am bold in these fewe lines to de∣dicate my loue to you: for it were
too tedious to vse many wordes, where good wil is the bond of loue. This smal gift I would intreate you to accept, if not for the quantitie, yet for the qualitie.
From London the thirteenth of October, 1610.
