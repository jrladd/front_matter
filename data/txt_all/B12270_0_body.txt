Worthy Sir,
THE Subiect of this ensu∣ing Discourse, is for com∣monnesse and familiarity, like thunder; the oftner heard, the lesse feared: did men but seriously recount how it will be the last try∣all, and vpon it an euer∣duringestate, either in hea∣uen or hell, they would ra∣ther desire to be often remembred of what they must once be called vnto. These Notions not long since deliuered to the eare, were neuer intended for the eye. Conscious∣nesse of mine owne meanenesse, and withall the great dis∣parity twixt a liuely voice, and breathlesse lines, haue easily disswaded me hitherto from appearing in Statio∣nary view. If now too soone, I must borrow my Apo∣logie
 from your selfe; whose request not onely commands, but passeth with me for an Approbation. Otherwise (as curiosity ouer-rules the case) it's neither nature, nor the God of nature that satisfieth all. This criticall Age of ours hath at once reuiued and verified Tertullians complaint; Nisi Deus homini placuerit, Deus non erit. The best is, as I cannot be confident of immunity from censure: so I am taught to neglect it. Gal. 1. 10. Should I seeke to please men, I were not the seruant of Christ. Such then as these reuised Papers are, I am bold to commend to the vse of Gods Church, vnder the patro∣nage and protection of your name. Reasons hereto indu∣cing, a stranger will not enquire after; and they that haue knowne my reference to such a pious Parishioner, a reall fauourer and encourager of my Ministery, neede not. Only may they find that acceptance, which the Author before them, and in any proportion further you in the way to heauen▪  haue no more to desire, but as Saint Paul for Onesiphorus, The Lord grant vnto you, that you may finde mercy of the Lord in that day.
