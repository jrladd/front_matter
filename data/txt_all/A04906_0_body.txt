HAuing written this small Treatise vnder the protectiō of thee most reuerend, most sweete, and almigh∣tie IESV (which I did begin with in∣tention to lyne out and directe a way vnto thee the author of all trueth and goodnesse) taking the cause vppon the greatest abuses of the worlde, raigning and raging euery where at this day: and continuing, concluded the same with exhortation of amende∣mēt of life according to thine expresse worde and commandements, aswell by thine owne selfe pronounced out of thy most sacred mouthe, at what time thou wert conuersaunt in this miserable vale, and anguished with the iniquities of Ierusulem, Corasm, Beth∣saida, the whole land of Iuda, yea and

all the worlde, and continually be fore that by the holy Prophetes which haue bin since the world began, whose bookes are so ful of declamatiō against sinne: and like argumentes to exhort the retourning vnto the Lorde with haste, and so laborious to prepare the way vnto thee. The greatest matter thē rested in hand to whom I should di∣rect the same, who might take the pro∣tection in hand of this my woorke to defend it against the maleuolent and malicious worldlings, who furnished with all the suggestions of Satan that olde enemy, who seaseth nullum non mouere lapidem against thee and thy truthe: Resting vpon this considera∣tion, I founde the great men of the world were busied, the richemen had no disposition, the meane men were afearde, the simple men might answer me, they could not iudge. And so not to trouble the great, nor to hazard the small, I determined to offer the same vnto thee (OIESV) which I pre∣sent vnto thy Diuine Maiestie with bowed knees, ioyned handes, and all

simplicitie of mind, beseeching thee mercifully to looke vpon mine infir∣mities who for the multitude of my sinnes am vnworthy to lifte vp mine eyes to thy mercy seate, and vnable to imagine any thing worthy of thine ac∣ceptance, but stayed on the founda∣tion of thy worde, wherein it appea∣reth how thou diddest accepte of the widowes myte, and how thou diddest condemne the seruant of sloth for hy∣ding his tallent, are sufficient assurāces of thy fauourable, fatherly and com∣fortable acceptance to such as with good intent of the fruites of their la∣bour yelde aught vnto thee, as sacrifice proceeding from the puritie of hearte whereof thou onely ar the searcher, vnto whose tuition I doe most hum∣bly submit my self body and soule.
