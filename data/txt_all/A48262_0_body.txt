My honourable Lo.
AMongst the rare and curious Propositions which I have learned out of the studies of the Mathematicks in the famous University of Pont a Mousson, I have taken singular pleasure in certaine Pro∣blemes no lesse ingenious than recreative, which drew me unto the search of de∣monstrations more difficult and serious; some of which I have amassed and caused to passe the Presse, and here dedicate them now unto your Honour; not that I account them worthy of your view, but in part to

testifie my affectionate desires to serve you, and to satisfie the curious, who de∣light themselves in these pleasant studies, knowing well that the Nobilitie, and Gentrie rather studie the Mathematicall Arts, to content and satisfie their affecti∣ons, in the speculation of such admirable experiments as are extracted from them, than in hope of gaine to fill their Purses. All which studies, and others, with my whole indevours, I shall alwayes dedicate unto your Honour, with an ardent desire to be accounted ever,
