KNowing all the vertues and en∣dowments
of Nobility, which
floisht in their height of emi∣nence
in your Ancestors, now,
as by a diuine legacy, and line∣all
inheritance, to suruiue in you;
and so consequently from you, to your truly
ennobled Issue. (Right Honourable) I presu∣med
to publish this vnworthy worke vnder
your gracious patronage: first, as an acknow∣ledgement
of that duty I am bound to you in,
as a seruant. Next, assured that your most iu∣diciall
cenre is as able to approue what there∣in
is authentike and good, as your Noble and

accustomed modesty will charitably conniue: if
there be any thing therein vnworthy your lear∣ned
approbation. I haue striu'd (my Lord) to
make good a subiect, which many through en∣uy,
but most through ignorance, haue sought
violently, (and beyond merit) to oppugne: in
which, if they haue either wandred through
spleene, or erred by non-knowledge, I haue
(to my power) plainly and freely illustrated,
propounding a true, direct, and faithfull dis∣course,
touching the Antiquity, the ancient
Dignity, and the true vse of Act, and their
quality. If my industry herein be by the com∣mon
Aduersary harshly receiued, but by your
Honour charitably censured, I haue from the
iniuditious (whom I esteeme not) but what I
expect: but from your Lordship (whom I e∣uer
reuerence) more then I can merit.
