READER,
TRuth never had that advantage nor countenance from
the men of this world, (though wise in their generation)
(since sin entered into it) to have the approbation of the World,
neither of the powers and Potentates thereof, for it alwaies hated
the truth, because it bore witness against the World, and the deeds
and works thereof which are evil; for Wisdom is only justi∣fied
of her Children; and Truth is justified of her Children:
neither indeed doth it need any other Patron to shelter it self
under, but the God of all Truth, from whence it proceeds; nei∣ther
shall I seek a shelter, neither run to any mountain or hill
for safety or protection, nor to the mighty of the Earth, as many
of latter dayes have done to Patronize their Labours, and to
make them the more acceptable, and to be the sooner and more
readily received: But seeing the Apostle saith, Not many
wise, not many rich, not many noble are chosen, but he
hath chosen the weak and poor, and despised of the world,
who are rich in Faith and good works, who are heirs of
the promise, and of the world to come. I chuse only to be
approved to the witness of Christs light in every mans Consci∣ence,
and to the measure of his holy Spirit which he hath placed
in every man, to that only I desire to be either approved, or by
it reproved, for wholly unto the judgment of that in every Con∣science
I appeal, and do commend this ensuing Discourse, in the
sight of God, and the Answer unto A. Smalwood's Book, who
hath sought to make void Christs command, for to obey the com∣mand
of men, as is manifest in his Epistle Dedicatory to the
Gentlemen of Cumberland: For it seems by his Epistle they
put him on work, to Preach and Print this Sermon, whether

upon this subject or not I shall not determine, but however he
sayes he hath obeyed their commands; though he hath laboured
as much as in him lies to make the command of Christ void, and
the Apostles Doctrine by his Arguments which he hath raised
to prove Christs Doctrine one thing, and his intention ano∣ther,
and so would blind the minds of people, only to establish the
Doctrines of men, and the Traditions of men in the Apostacy,
and hath put divers Constructions upon the plain words of the
Scripture and interpretation to prove his false Assertion that he
laid down at the first, that Christ did not forbid all swearing;
I say I could have willingly have been silent rather then to be
found over and over again contending with every new opposer,
of those old truths, that have been believ'd and received long
before the Apostacy entered in, which hath been answer'd (by
that People I own, in judgment and conversation) long ago; to
let pass those disadvantages, we have adventered upon; our
low persecuted, imprisoned, and in a manner condemned
condition, so that we may exspect our words, how true soever,
yet they are not like to gain much credit against such an eminent
man as Doctor Smallwood. Again, considering how we ex∣pose
our selves to the lash and severity of a sharp law, which some
men in their blind zeal are far more ridged and severe in their
Prosecution of it then I am apt to believe the supream enact∣ors
of it were in their intentions when they did inact it; all
which notwithstanding are no discouragement unto me, for as
much as the internal and eternal truth of our God, which we
have known, received and believed, is very precious in our eyes,
yea, far more then either life or liberty, and estate, (which some
have forfeited and lost upon Truths account) or any external
treasure, or outward enjoyment whatsoever, so that considering
how the truth lies at stake we cannot be silent, least thereby we
should appear to some mens apprehensions, as to be satisfied with
what the Doctor hath said, and own his Arguments & Reasons

that he hath laid down for possitive truth; I could do no less
then to show our dislike of his Doctrine, and to manifest the
weakness of his Arguments about this particular of Swearing
at all, under the Gospel, though he hath strained very hard to
prove his Assertion, that Oaths may lawfully he taken by Christi¦ans
in some cases, notwithstanding Christs prohibition and
command to the contrary, but of how little effect or force his
Reasons are thou wilt see in the ensuing Discourse, although his
Book be looked upon by some, to be sufficient force to convince all
gain-sayers, and although he say he hath had divers Papers and
Books of Dissenters, who are of a contrary judgment, where he
found any Reason offered against what he hath laid down for
Doctrine, he hath answered, though indeed he hath over-riden
the most weighty matters in them, and hath said little but that
hath been said before by other opposers of Christs Doctrine;
though its very like the Doctor will count this but a loose Dis∣course,
as he hath done others of very great weight, (yea indeed
of more weight and reason in them then any thing, he hath
exhibited, yet to the contrary) and so count it not worth taking
notice of; but though he do not, it is not of much moment, for
that end only I have writ, to bear my testimony for Christs
Doctrine against all the false and feigned interpretations of men,
being that which I have stedfastly believed, and is of that
force and weight upon many Consciences, and so evident by the
Spirit of Christ, that they can receive nothing of mans faln
reason and conceptions which are variable and changable to an∣swer,
or weigh down the Doctrine of Christ, and his Apostles,
and Primitive Christians, who walked in the order of the Gos∣pel,
and obeyed the Commands of Christ before the Apostacy
entered in, and the power was lost, and the life and Spirit of
Christ erred from) and mingled the Ordinances of the first and
second Covenant together, and the injunctions of men among
them for Doctrine, and then compelled all to receive it, all this

long time of Antichrists reign, and the false Church visibility,
wherein she hath sitten as a Queen upon the Waters, which are
the Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People, which A. S.
brings as a great argument to prove Swearing in use among
Christians since Christ gave out that command, Swear not at
all. The reasons the very strength of them, I have laid down
as A. S. hath published them, without varying from his own
words; the Answer thou may peruse and read without prejudice,
and weigh with the measure of Gods Spirit in thy self, for unto
that I appeal, which is a more certain thing then Councils, or
Nations, or Consent of multiudes, who hath the name of
Christian, and walks not in his Doctrine, neither lives his
life, nor doth the things he saith, I am shut up in a corner, and
have not that advantage that some opposers have of others la∣bours
as to bring Authors of divers Ages that denied to Swear,
though not only some there were but many; but alas, they are
condemned already by A. S. and others for Phanaticks and
Heteradox, and so their sayings, will seem of less force, but
however, I have not much striven, neither shall to fetch things
from far in the Apostacy, but rest in that which makes all things
evident, even the spirit of God in thy own heart and the Scrip∣tures
of Truth, which was spoken by the Spirit, which are so
clear unto many, that there needs not multitude of words, to
demonstrate this truth of the prohibition of all Oaths among
true Christians; but I shall not detain thee from the matter it
self, and the Lord give thee an understanding.
