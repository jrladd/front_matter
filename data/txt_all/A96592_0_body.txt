Most gracious Soveraigne,
WIth no small paines (and the more for want of my books, and of any set∣led place, being multùm terris jacta∣tus & alto, frighted out of mine house, and tost betwixt two distra∣cted Kingdomes) I have collected out of the sacred Scripture, explained by the ancient Fathers, and the best Writers of Gods Church, these few Rights our of many, that God and nature, and Nations, and the Lawes of this Land have fully and undeniably granted unto our Sveraigne Kings. My witnesse is in Heaven, that as my conscience directed me, with∣out any squint aspect, so I have with all sincerity, and freely traced and expressed the truth, as I shall
 answer to the contrary at the dreadfull judgement; ; therefore with all fervency I humbly supplicate the divine Majestie, still to assist Your Highnesse, that, as in Your lowest ebbe, You have put on righteousnesse as a breast-plate, and with an heroick resolution withstood the proudest waves of the raging Seas, and the violent attempts of so many imaginary Kings; so now, in Your ac∣quired strength, You may still ride on with Your ho∣nour; and, for the glory of God, the preservation of Christ his Church, and the happinesse of this King∣dom, not for the greatest storme that can be threat∣ned, suffer these Rights to be snatched away, nor Your Crowne to be throwne to the dust, nor the sword that God hath given You, to be wrested out of Your hand by these uncircumcised Philistines these ungracious rebels, and the vessels of Gods wrath, , unlesse they do most speedily re∣pent; for if the unrighteous will be unrighteous still, and our wickednesse provoke God to bring our Land to desolation, Your Majestie, standing in the truth and for the right, for the honour of God and the Church of his Sonne, is absolved from all blame, and all the bloud that shall be spilt, and the oppressions, insolencies, and abhominations that are perpetrated, shall be required at the hands, and re∣venged
 upon the heads of these detested rebels. You are and ought, in the truth of cases of conscience, to be informed by Your Divines; and I am confident that herein they will all subscribe, that God will undoubtedly assist You, and arise in his good time, to maintaine his owne cause; and by this warre, that is so undutifully, so unjustly made against Your Maje∣stie, so Giant like fought against Heaven, to over∣throw the true Church, You shall be glorious like King David, that was a man of warre, whose deare sonne raised a dangerous rebellion against him, and in whose reigne so much bloud was spilt; and yet, notwithstanding these distempers in his Domini∣on, he was a man according to Gods owne heart, espe∣cially, because that from α to ωAs, in the be∣ginning, by re∣ducing the Arke from the Phi∣listines, through∣out the midst, by setling the service of the Tabernacle, & in the ending by his resoluti∣on to build, and leaving such a treasure for the erecting of the Temple., the beginning of his raigne, to the end of his life, his chiefest endeavour was to promote the service, and protect the ser∣vants of the Tabernacle, the Ministers of Gods Church. God Almighty so continue Your Maje∣stie, blesse You and protect You in all Your wayes, Your vertuous, pious Queene, and all Your royall Progenie. Which is the daily prayer of
