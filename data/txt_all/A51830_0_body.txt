Honoured Sir,
VVHEN you was pleased to Impose this Piece of Ser∣vice upon me, and thereby drew me out of that Privacy whichI confess my self fond of, because very sensible how well it becomes me: I did not in the least think of being made more Publick. But since the repeated Importunity of some to whom I owe Obedience, being joyned to your own Desires and Encouragement, have at last laid a kind of necessity upon me; I gladly, Sir, Embrace this Opportuni∣ty of Expressing the Sence of a whole Neighbourhood, who find themselves extreamly happy in your Presence, and Authority amongst them. Whilst, lea∣ving the Extravagant Persuit, of I know not what Imaginary Gallantries, to those Vain Souls that are not ca∣pable of more Rational Satisfactions: You, Sir, Live Honourably in your Countrey, where by an approved Loy∣alty to Their Majesties, upon whose
Prosperity that of the Whole Nation doth Depend; By an Ʋnshaken Zeal for our Holy Religion and Established Church, in whose Happiness that of the State is Inseparably Included; By a Well-Re∣gulated Family; an Exemplary Oeco∣nomy; an Ʋpright Justice, sweetned with a Peaceful Pacifying Temper, You Worthily Endear Your self to all that are Wise and Good: And do indeed Appear that Magistrate I have here endeavoured to describe.
May so Great a Merit never miss of as Great a Reward, But may the Abundant Mercies of God continually Descend upon You, Your Excellent Good Lady, and most Hopeful Chil∣dren; that so my Countrey may never want an Arundel to do it Service andCredit; nor any of Your House ever want that Respect and Honour so long Injoyed by the
Cranes Your Ancestours. This is part of the Dayly Prayers of
Sir,
 Old Stratford,
Octob. 15. 1694.
