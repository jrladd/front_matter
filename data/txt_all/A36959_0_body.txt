My Lord,
THe Particular favour your Lordship has been al∣ways pleas'd to bestow on my Genius and En∣deavours, and not only on mine, but on Poetry in general, which has still appear'd by your good-natur'd Condescension, and Readiness to assist the Stage against its Enemy's Injustice, has engag'd me not only to give your Lordship my grateful thanks, but to beg leave to dedicate my last off spring to your service; in hopes it will be so happy to make an hour pass plea∣santly in the Country, at a time when your Lordship has a little leisure to retire from your Affairs at Court.
As I doubt not but your Lordship has been Entertain'd with the baiting of the Poets, by a late horrible Severe and Rigid Critick, so I also hope, that now, or very sudden∣ly you will be diverted with the aforesaid Critick's being exercis'd by the Poets. That Performer, by those who are taken with Glosses more than Realities, has had a

mighty Cry of his side; but, as one mans Tale may not always be so good as 'tis thought when anothers comes to be heard, so it may happen that his ill-manner'd Remarks upon me may give occasion for as good a Scene to please your Lordship, in an Answer of my Writing, as the Ori∣ginal Lampoon did of his.
My Lord, 'tis fit that I inform your Lordship that I would not have presum'd to have troubled you with this Dedication, had not the following sheets been Encou∣rag'd by men of the first rate understandings in England, whose Commendation made me think 'em consequently fit for your perusal. Besides, having been for many years so happy to know that your Lordship is of a Judgment so Clear, a Temper so Generous and Just, and a Humour so Charmingly obliging, that a Poet is not only Honour'd and Caressd, but his Labour from Injustice and Unrea∣sonable Malice nobly indulg'd and defended.
'Tis certainly therefore proper, that to such a Patron a soaring Muse shou'd be entirely devoted: The Poet's Song has always the greatest Influence when the Theme improves the Harmony: And your Lordship's Character is of such Efficacy with me, that whenever I am Inspird with it, which I hope I shall often be, as well as now, I am very well assur'd, my Auditory, when they shall hear me sing on that subject, will never imagine the time lost or ill spent, or me out of Tune.
But to avoid Prolixity on a subject, which I know is ungrateful to your Lordships Admirable Temper, (I mean Praise) I will unwillingly leave off here, and only beg to be rank'd amongst those many that have a true sense of your valu'd qualities. And if the following Piece diverts, as I hope it will, and gains that favourable reception, which your Indulgence, Affability and Good Nature pro∣mises, through all your Actions, to all those who are so happy to be concern'd with you, it will be a surprizing satisfaction to,
My Lord,
