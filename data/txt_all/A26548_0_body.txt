MY LORD,
THE Liberal ARTS
(amongst which, with the
Greeks and Romans,
I place Painting) do so
naturally depend upon the
Countenance of Great Men,
that without their Protection, they seldom take
Root enough to defend themselves against

Envy and Ignorance: Nor, on the other
side, does Greatness it self, though never so
Luxuriant, either sit Easie in its present
Enjoyments, or live Kindly in the Memory of
Posterity, without those Ornaments of its Pow∣er,
the Arts and Sciences. But this Ali∣ana
of Knowledge and Greatness, is always
more Conspicuous, where the Maecenas is not
only a Lover, but a Judge of the Beauties
of Ingenious Productions: This being, where
could I have sought a Patron, but in your
Lordship, for the Improvement of an Art,
which makes one of your chiefest Delights; and
in the Knowledge of which, you show as much
Skill as the Artists themselves do in the Exe∣cution.
Secret Beauties are the great Charm
of Life to Dilicate Souls; but they want nice
Observers to be enjoyed; and Pictures have
that singular Priviledge, that though they seem
Legible Books, yet they are perfect Hiero∣glyphicks
to the Vulgar, and are all alike

to them. 'Tis to remedy in some measure, this
Misfortune of so noble an Art, that I have
taken the pains; your Lordship will see if you
daign to look into this Volume, which is
Humbly Dedicated to you: The World, I am
sure, will justifie my choice of a Patron, what∣ever
they may do for the Book it self; for in
your Lordship, besides Nobleness of Birth, and
Eminency of Fortune and Dignity, there is an
Innate Sweetness and Candour, accompanied
with a Serenity of Temper, and Firmness of
Courage; which draw to you the Vows and Re∣spects
of Mankind, and make Offerings of this
Nature to be but just Tributes to so known a
Merit. I should hardly, after this, dare to
mention my particular Obligations to your No∣ble
Family, could I hope for a more favoura∣ble
Occasion of Expressing that Gratitude
which I owe: They were laid upon me, not only
in my Infancy, but even some days after my
Birth; and so Generously contrived, that they

are like to last as long as I live: And there∣fore
I reckon my Dependance to be a part of
my Being; and shall as soon forfeit the one as
the other: I am only sorry that Fortune
concurs so little with my Wishes, as to have
made me hitherto an Useless Servant to your
Lordship, whose particular Merit I have al∣ways
as much Admired, as others may do the
Splendour of your Fortune; the Influence of
both will, I hope, be felt by this Noble Art of
Painting; and I in my particular, shall be
continually studying how to express my De∣votion
to your Lordship's Service, in a
better Manner than by barely assuring, as I
do now, that I am,
My Lord,
Your Lordship's most Humble,
Obedient, and Obliged Servant,
