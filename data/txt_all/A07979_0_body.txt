Sir,
I Have (though boldly being a stranger) elected you, to countenance a piece, that (undeserved∣ly I hope) hath beene de∣nied the credit which it might have gain'd from the Stage; though I can

accuse my selfe of no errour in it, more than a nice curiosity (which not with∣standing I must boast to be without pre∣sident) in the method where I have de∣ni'd my selfe much liberty, that may be allow'd a Poet from old example, and new establisht custome. Your selfe have given many sufficient testimonies of your owne abilities and judgement, by your owne many published and un∣questionable labours. In giving way and pardon to this bold act of mine, you will engage to thankefulnesse, & honour him that is ambitious to be knowne by you, and stil'd
Your honourer and humble Servant,
