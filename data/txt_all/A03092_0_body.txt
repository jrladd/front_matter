Noble Sir,
THere is a double Tie upon my du∣ty towards you, that bindes me to the largest acknowledge∣ment that can bee ex∣prest by my best abili∣ties:

Your generall eminence both in Ho∣nour, and, the worthiest meanes to it, Desert (which duly chalenge the generall observance of all men) and your particular noble fa∣vours to me, that re∣quire from me a never sufficient gratitude. But as Presents derive their value as well from the esteeme of the Re∣ceiver,

as from their owne inherent quali∣ties; so will you make this rich by your acce∣ptance, that is without all worth as it is my poore Donative, though it containe in it selfe many secret and mysti∣call vertues, being an Enchiridion of many rare subjects, both Morall and Divine, fit for the most serious

observation and medi∣tation: The industry of many excellently-learned Authors, whose severall Papers were most accidentally com∣mitted to me, to be their fortunate, though un∣worthy, preserver and Publisher. The only end for which I beg your Noble disposition to entertaine it, is that it may be understood a te∣stimony

of his due thank∣fulnesse, whose only ambition is to be knowne and stiled,
