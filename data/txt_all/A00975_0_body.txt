SIR, your very anci∣ent Gentry doth not so enoble you in the eyes of the

world, as your new man in the sight of the Church:Greg. Naz. , saith that ancient & eloquent Father, The new birth is the noblest birth: In the Creation, Man was the first, and last creature; last in time, first in place and dignily, being made the Sonne of God,Luk 3. 38. and the great Favourite of hea∣ven. And now the New Creature, though last borne, as Iacob, yet as Ia∣cb, obtaines the birth-right, and over-tops the elder. The best Herald,

Now though I well know that the neare relation of fleshly Alli∣ance, and bloud which is betwixt us, (beside many other knots of friendship) have tyed my heart, long since, unto you both, in all unfeyned affection, yet this spirituall kindred is a much dearer, and nea∣rer linke, uniting my soule unto you in the bond of the Spirit; so that I can truly say with that blessed Apostle,es. .8 I am affectionately desirous

of you, and willing to impart to you (not onely this slender fruit of) the Go∣spell (but) mine owne soule, bebause you were deare un∣to mee. I am confident you will receive this pledge of love with the same afection with which it is presented, and therefore leaving these few Consolations to the application of that great Comforter, and your selves with all your Olive branches, unto the Vnction of that holy one, and perfect growth

of the blessed Spirit, I commend the weake Author to your Christi∣an love, and prayers, who while hee is, shall ever be
