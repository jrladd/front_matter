REading of late (my Lord) a Chapter of Esdras, folding up in a mysticall and dark discourse, a li∣ving Representation of a long time, whereof the most is past, and some little to come; I thought it no lost labour to take my Pen and unfold the same, that therein wee may behold (which naturally all desire to see) as well the issues of things to come, as what is past, or now in being: and thereafter to qualifie and moderate our hopes, and call our troubled thoughts (which otherwise run with reins on Neck) within the Circle and limitation, bounded and drawn from above.
And finding this Prophesie written by a Man greatly belo∣ved of God, and thereto (which rare is) a Prines Favou∣rite, high in grace with a King of Persia; I presumed the rather to present this my Labour to your Hon. Lordship, as upon whom God hath vouchsafed like great and rare graces. 'Tsufficeth that your Honour read it, greater favour Esdras seeketh not.
He Labours not to praise or please, which now a dayes finds many friends; but to admonish and forewarne, which fataly finds none, till't be too late.
He fears not the Noble and Learned Reprover of supposed Predictions, for he hath heard him honour the Prophesies of Holy Writ, wherein himselfe hath no less honour gotten, then
 given. His other Enemies have wisht me to conceal, and to reserve them to a more open hearing. But Esdras is at the next leaf (my Lord) and craves your Honours patience for an Hour.
