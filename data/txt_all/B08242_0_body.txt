Truely Vertuous,
NOne that know you but know your worth is so farre above a Comple∣mentall flatterie, that who har∣bors a thought thereto, be wraies himselfe a sycophantizing Pa∣rasite. None that know me, but know

 is as farre be∣neath me, as a Complement is above me: In downe right fide∣lity, did not your ample and ad∣mired testimony of good seed, sowne in good ground, discover it selfe, the world should never have been intelligenced thus, of your continuall practice, to un∣derstand and record the prin∣ciples of Religion: your atten∣tivenesse at, your delightfulnesse in, sacred Ordinances; a shame, as patterne to riper yeares: May I adde, tis pitty, but all incouragement to a further pro∣gresse, should raise it selfe, to steele your resolution, in imita∣ting and exceeding Honourable precedency: That the last may

be the best gener  m∣ber (hopefull off-spring) what advantages you have above mil∣lions of Families in the conti∣nuall dropping of Gospell-Or∣dinances; if your measure sur∣mount not other, you come short; if you grow not in grace, as in yeares, you frustrate expecta∣tion. I have over-boldened my selfe to present this to your eye, which was tendred to your eare, and taken by your Pen; but your gracious and noble spirit can ac∣cept the desires, and connive at the failings of them that wish you well in the Lord.

Wisedome with an inheritance is good, spake that wise, and rich man, and King: your inheritance is faire in respect of the nether, let your continuall growth in the grace of Jesus Christ speak you still wonderfull in regard of the upper springs. Proceed (gracious stem) to florish, so as long you may continue an ex∣ample and honour to your Fa∣mily, an encouragement to all that feare God, a president to all young noble plants, and an

ornament to the  Christ.
For this purpose (pardon the presumption) I have dared to Dedicate to your worthinesse, the Saints practice, with their pri∣vilege, and path-way to both; the two first discoursed in your Chapley-field Oratory, the last to my dearely beloved Parish.
May the Lord reap glory, you, or for your sake any, bene∣fit; Who can expresse my joy or thanks? Thus bowing the knee to the Father of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, making continuall mention of you in my prayers day and night without ceasing, that the Lord would bestow up∣on you length of dayes, with

, perfecting the good work he hath hopefully be∣gun in you, to his eternall glory, and your everlasting salvation by Jesus Christ, to whose in∣tercession and acceptance I commend your soule and body: resting,
