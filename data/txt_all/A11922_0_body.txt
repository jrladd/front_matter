SJR,
NO vaine ambition of mine owne Desire, much lesse presumption of my none Desert, incited me to present this Volume to your Princely view; but rather, the gracious Countenance, which (euen from your Childehood) you haue euer daigned to all good endeauours, invited Mee also (after so many others) to offer at the high-Altar of your Highnesse fauour, this new-Naturalized VVorke of a learned Stran∣ger: Not with pretence of Profit to your Highnesse (who want not more exquisite Tutors in all excellent Sciences) but, vnder the Patronage of your power∣full Name, to benefite the Publicke; and conuay vnto my Countrymen (especially Ar∣chitects and Artificers of all sorts) these Necessary, Certaine, and most ready Helps of Geometrie: The ignorance and want whereof, in times past (in most parts of this King∣dome) hath left vs many lame VVorkes, with shame of many VVorkemen; which, for the future, the Knowledge and vse of these Instructions shall happily preuent, if the euent but answere (in any measure) to that Hope of mine, which alone both induced this Desire and produced this Designe: VVherein I must confesse my part but small, sauing my great aduenture in the Charge, and my great Good-will to doe Good. All which, together with my best Seruices, I humbly prostrate at your Princely feete, as beseemes
