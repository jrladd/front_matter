SIR,
THese two Ser∣mons were brought unto me for the Sermons of that learned and religi∣ous Divine, whose name they beare: and, so farre as I am able to judge, the stile and spi∣ritualtie of the matter

argue no lesse. Being earnestly requested to peruse them, I thought fit to commend them to the world under your name, because I know that you so well affected the Author. Now my request unto you is, that you would be pleased to accept the Dedication of them as a testimony of his sin∣cere affection, who la∣bours, and prayes for your good in the best things,
