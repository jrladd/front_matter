My Honoured Friends,
I Do not set here your Names,
designing to Celebrate your rare
Christian Vertues. These have
long shone brightly in your Country;
and their Fame hath rung very loudly
in this City. You have good report
of all Men, and of the Truth it
self. So that it would be no News

if it should be here told what your
Praise is in the Churches.
Wherefore, I Meditate what is
more Expedient; what doth better
Become me, and will less Dis∣please
you. Intending no more,
than to make you a small Present
of these Pages, as an Acknowledg∣ment
of your Favours.
Their Subject is, unto Most, a
Hard-Saying; with too Many, an
Obsolete one; and whereof, not
a few will say, Who can bear it?
Nor should I have thought it an
Argument grateful to your own Palats,
but that I do very well know under
what Shadow you Sit, and whose
Fruit it is that is sweet to your
Taste Whereby I am certified,
that you will as much more Value
this Discourse, as you less Need it,

than others do for the Regulation
of your own Speech.
I shall Congratulate my Self the
good Nature of my Readers, if it
be he who really Needs it not,
that Casts the first Stone at it.
But, I will reverence the Doctrine
that I Preach; and Talk no more
to you in this Porch.
With a special, Flame my Prayer
ascends, for your Selves, and your
blessed Branches. The good Lord
continue still, to teach you the
Way that you are to Chuse;
and to make your Souls dwell
at Ease in Grace, till they shall
triumph in Glory! May your Seed
after you inherit the Earth; and
be such Blessings unto their Coun∣try
as your Holy Ancestors have
been, and as you your selves are

this Day! Thus, pray, very many;
but none more sincerely, than

Bridges-Street, near
Covent-Garden,
Jan. 22. 1693-94.
