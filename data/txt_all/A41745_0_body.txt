May it please Your Grace,
AS there is a small An∣nual
Rent payable to

one of your Norfolk Man∣nors,
from that little Spot of
ground which I possess; so there
is a great and perpetual Tri∣bute
of Honour due to your
Grace, from the Possessor of it.
And as the holding that Land
gives me the Priviledge, to be
one of the Tenants of a most
Just and Generous Lord; so the
Tenure of my Reason, while I
shall be Master of any, will
make it my Duty, to be one of
the most Humble, most Awful,
and most Obsequious Admi∣rers,
of such a truly Noble and
Puissant Prince, as Personal
Virtue would have made your

Grace, if Glory of Ancestors
had not.
This I have been ambitious
publickly to acknowledge, and I
kneel to your Clemency for a
Pardon of the bold Product of
that Ambition, the almost un∣pardonable
Confidence of a De∣dicatory
Address from so mean
to so great a Person, and the
presuming to offer such imper∣fect
Discourses, as these Ser∣mons,
to your most piercing and
discerning Judgment.
But whatever Defects they may
labour under, they were Preach∣ed
with an Honest Design of
doing God and the King the

most seasonable Service I could,
in these Licentious and Sedi∣tious
Times. And they are
now Published with an encou∣raging
Hope, as well as with
an humble Desire, of receiving
the best Advantage they are
capable of, towards the pro∣moting
their well chosen Design,
if they may be sheltered un∣der
the auspicious and favou∣rable
Protection of such an Il∣lustrious
Patron of Pious Loy∣alty,
as the First and High∣est
Duke in England, next
to those of the Blood Royal,
manifesty is, I had almost said,
necessarily must be.

Your Grace well knoweth
that Loyalty is a considerable
Part of Christian Religion;
and that it is no where more
strenuously asserted, than in the
Church of England; a Church
signally Eminent as upon all
other Accounts, so particular∣ly
for requiring of all her Mem∣bers
the most faithful Allegi∣ance
and Subjection to their
Lawful Soveraign, his Heirs
and Successors.
Hence it was, that (al∣though
the present Age hath
afforded but few Proselytes
from the Church of Rome to
us, and too many from us to





them) neither the Corruption
of the Times, nor the prejudi∣ces
of Education, nor the pow∣erful
Influence of the Neerest
and Noblest Relations, nor a∣ny
of those tempting Considera∣tions,
which bear so great a
sway with other Men, could
keep Your Grace from the Com∣munion
of our Church; a thing
very memorable and worthy to
be known by all Posterity, both
to our Churches eternal Ho∣nour,
and to Your Graces im∣mortal
Renown.
My Lord, The very Height
of your Dignity, inferior only
to Sacred Majesty, and Roy∣al

Highness, doth hardly equal
the transcendent Height of your
Great and Noble Spirit;
which makes it a Province
worthy of an Angel, to give a
just Character of Your Grace,
and forbids my weak Pen to at∣tempt
it, lest I should affront
Your Heroick Virtue, with a
dissonant and deformed Pa∣negyrick.
But yet, as an Echo
of publick Fame, I shall ad∣venture
to repeat, what with
an unanimous Voice is general∣ly
said of Your Grace, That
none ever more deser∣vedly
enjoyed the Fa∣vour
of his Prince, or

the love of his Country.
And long may your Grace live
to enjoy more and more of both,
until you be at last tran∣slated
from this great Hap∣piness
to a far Greater. So
prays,
My Lord,
Your Graces
most humbly
devoted Servant
