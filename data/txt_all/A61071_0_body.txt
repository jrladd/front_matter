SIRS,
SInce the People of the World imagine ye to be Prisoners, I shall endeavour to offer my instructions how you may convince them of their Errors: Study how to be Content; so though you change your place, your Fortunes are the same; ye alter the habitation of your Bodies, for the better enjoying the tranquillity of your minds. He is truly Noble, that knows how to rejoyce in Crosses, as well as in Contents; that will not think of Desperation, nor be urged with Impatience. The Body of a wise man, is a House unto the Soul; but to the ig∣norant, a Prison: for the discontented man is a slave to his own humours, and a Prisoner in a double sense. Nor can the Soul of a discreet man be confined, more than the windy breath of Boreas; or as easie is it to shut up the bright beams of light within a Chrystal. No Prison in the world, be it famous, or infamous, can be so deep, as to bury; so dark, as to blind; so strait, so crooked, so narrow, as to bind the Ge∣nius of a wise man: for wisdom is the wing of the Soul, that bears it not only out of Prison, but to all the parts of the Terrestrial Globe. A continuation of which happiness, is heartily wished by
(GENTLEMEN)
