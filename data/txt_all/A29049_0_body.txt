RIGHT HONOURABLE.
THose who owe great sums of Money, and withal have any thank-ful esteem for the civility and kindness of their Creditours, do seldom come to ask any longer time of forbearance, but they bring a Present in their hands, not so much in part of payment, as to give a Test and Evidence of their Gratitude, and to shew how willing they are to deserve a Favour. Thus, my Lord, I having now some moneths been indebt∣ed
to your Lordship, for a Work of another Nature, and by those many Intervenient Businesses (which this Town is but too full of, and which as I could not prevent, so your Lordship was not willing I should decline them) foreseeing that I shal not presently be in a capacity of satis∣fying my own Desires, which shall alwayes be commensu∣rate to my Obedience unto Your Lordships Commands; I made hast therefore, together with my request for some longer time, to bring along with me this small Offering, not onely as part of the Tribute Iowe, but likewise to pre∣vent all sinister suspitions, as if, while I omited to do that which your Lordship principally enjoyned, I had al∣together idled away my time, and done just nothing at all; which, besides the sin of it to my self, would be too un∣handsome a return of your Lordships Noblenesse, in af∣fording me so full convenience and opportunities of stu∣die.
And though some of those things I have writ, since this Engagement was upon me, may seem to be Casual and un∣designed in their Choice, yet I must humbly leave it to your Lordships Judgement (whose thorough knowledge of that Controversie makes you the fittest person to decide it) to resolve, whether my late Treatise about Heresies, and this about the Spirituality of Gods Nature & Worship, were not antecedently necessary to be published, before I proceeded to meddle with the Popes Infallibility; which, as your Lordship hath often most judiciously observed, is the At∣las
and Principal Column to support all that Babylonish Building; and could it but once be removed out of the way (which sure is no great Mastery, in a thing that is so Airy and so defencelesse) all that is built upon it, would, for want of a Foundation, tumble down to the Ground. And this employment, of laying my Ax to the Root of that Tree, your Lordship, who could have done it much better, was pleased long since to lay upon me, and there∣by (that you might be free to serve the Publick) denyed your self that Honour, which, in so famous and con∣cerning a Cause, Your Lordships own more able and learn∣ed Pen would have justly gained you.
But how impatient and eager soever I was to perform this Task, and thereby give your Lordship a suddain Proof of my obedience, yet I had not waded far into it, but presently my edge was taken off; for the Arguments I met with to maintain that Opinion, were so very Weak and Fallacious; there was so large a train of Non sequi∣tur's, and such a series of Impossible Suppositions, that I grew quickly tired, not so much with the length and difficulty of the Journey, as with the Noysom Dirt and meer Tediousness of the Way: And I immediately took it for granted, that none of those Authors I read, did be∣lieve the Popes Infallibility themselves, since they took so little pains to convince others. And here, my Lord, for want of finding something that might deserve a Scho∣lar-like confutation, I have stuck ever since, and though
my Papers wanted but one day to perfect them, yet the Ab∣surdities I oppose, are so grosse and open, and the Conquest so very easie, that I am almost ashamed of my victory, and therefore have not yet been at the pains to compleat it.
Whilest I did thus delay to perfect my First Design, I thought Writers of Controversies ought to do, like Generals of Armies; before they sit down before the Capital City, they summon in every petty Garison, which might either im∣pede their March, or prove a Retreat for the vanquish∣ed Enemy: So before the Main Question in any Contro∣versie be handled, every Objection that lies perdue in the way, must be answered, that so those stumbling-blocks being removed, we may have a better prospect into the Strength or Weakness of any Point, as it stands by it self, without the Enterfering of those Additional Appen∣dixes. In this, the Kingdome of Christ and Antichrist agree, that to the Destruction of the one, as well as to the Establishing of the other, the way must be first prepared and levelled, and before their Fort of Infallibility be ta∣ken, all the snares they scatter in the way, all their Mists and undermining Polices, all their Ambushes and little Hiding-places, and lastly every thing, which may render the Victory insecure and hazzardous must be discovered and prevented.
Since then the Papists do commonly use two Masks, un∣der which they cover their Dark and Divilish Doctrine; the one of a terrible and frightful appearance, (which is
their vehement urging the great Inconveniences that fol∣low separation from them; in which the multiplicity of He∣risies is most Tragically insisted on: And for which our Church is still reproached by them as Schismatical) The other of a more benign and pleasing Aspect; which is the outward gaudery, & curious dresse of their Religion, where∣with that Spiritual Whore attires her self, and strong∣ly fascinates her unwary beholders. In opposition to the first, before I had the honour to attend your Lordship, I pleaded for Christian Liberty, in the just extent and latitude of it; I have already shewed that those ill consequences so much talked of, do not flow from Liberty, (which no Rational, much, lesse Spiritu∣al agent can be without) but from the abuse of it; which if it breaks out into Civil or Moral misdemeanors, the Ci∣vil Laws ought to punish, unto which our Outward Man is subject; but if it terminate and rest in speculative errors, which may otherwise be called Heresies, such Tares ought to grow together with the Wheat; for an un an∣swerable reason, which Christ hath given, though Anti∣christ approves it not, for fear the rooting up of them by violence, should prove the Destruction of the good Corn also; for since every Heretick, thinks his own Opinion to be true; if he finds nothing used to sup∣presse him, but such force, as no Scripture doth countenance; what will hinder him, when he gains Power, from using Legem Talionis, and endeavouring the same violent waies
of suppressing dissenters? and then it will be in vain to plead for Liberty, which by appearing first in persecution of Hereticks, we denied to others. And this, my Lord, is the summe of what I have lately published, and dedica∣ted to your Noble Kinsman, who is most Dear to your Lord∣ship,
Sir J.V. not more by the nearnesse of his Relation unto your Excellent Lady, then by his Resemblance and Imitation of the same Vertuous and Noble Qualities. Ʋnto whose indeavours on my behalf, I have me thinks made but too faint a return, since by his means I have been made parta∣ker of one of the greatest Temporal Happinesses I could am∣bition, and that is an acquaintance with, and a Personall Relation to your Lordship and Family; in which who ever fails of living virtuously, must fall inexcusably by his own Fault, since he is every day taught the contrary, and that by Eminent and Illustrious Examples.
As for that other Maske of a Glittering and Pompous Worship, which makes the Romane Religion so taking with Vulgar and Injudicious Observers; and by which their eyes are so dazzled, that they are unwilling to admit of any thing, which may undeceive them; I did conceive no∣thing could better take them off from doting upon that Painted Carcasse of Devotion, then to make a discourse a∣hout the Inward purity of Gospel-worship, which de∣pends upon and flows from the consideration of Gods Spi∣ritual Nature; which were it but once thoroughly under∣stood, men would presently spurne and trample upon all
that Devised and Fantastick Beauty of the Ro∣mish Dagon; and when true worshippers felt, how much the Splendor of service, which feeds the eye, is short of the Spirituality of it, which satisfies the soul; they would no longer feed upon Huskes, or let their senses lead them in the choise of their Religion. Since it may be found by ex∣perience that Thretrical Pomp, Delightful Aires, Wel∣tuned Orisons and the loud Insignificant Jargon of Latine Payers, do only glut and sate the appetite, but leave the Understanding unfruitful; like Rich and Poinant sawces, they gratifie the Flesh, but perish with the Using, and after all the Immoderate care about them, their end must be to be cast out into the Draught.
I have therefore in this short Treatise endeavoured to raise the Soul, that it might understand the True Height of Religious Worship, by fixing an intent eye upon the Au∣thor of it, which may be of great Ʋse in this Age we live in, as equally opposing the Bold Atheisme of some, and the mean-spirited Superstition of others; and because I entend it as an Introduction unto my following Discourse against the Pope and Church of Romes Infallibility, I humbly begg your Lordship's acceptance of it, which is the only way to make both It and the Author Con∣siderable. Since, to omit your Lordship's other Excellen∣cies, even in this very part of Learning (which argues a great and universal insight) of Accurate and close writing
as well as speaking, your Lordship hath gained such a Ge∣neral and Deserved Esteem, that if this piece doth pass into the World, under the Countenance of your Lordships Approbation, it will be a sufficient pass-port, without any other Recommendation.
But I shall forbear to urge, what, though it may become me to speak, because I speak knowingly, yet your Lordship may be unwilling to hear, since you care not for living in the Aire of your own praise; I shall conclude therefore, with desiring that your Lordship may be long preserved to do, what you have alwaies hitherto done, things truly great and Noble; that while others begin to scorn Religion, you may still go on to practice the Truth and stricktness of it; That with Your Honourable and Virtuous Lady and Fami∣ly, You may shine in the brightest Sphere of Honour here, and of Happiness hereafter, this is and shall be the Constant Prayer of
Drury-Lane
