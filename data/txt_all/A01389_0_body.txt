MAster Wither; When I first
tooke vp your Booke to
reade, (which I confesse I
did not out of curiositie,
Criticisme, or any desire to
bee your Antagonist) I
thought to make the same
vse of it for Collections and
obseruations, as I haue accustomed out of other
mens endeauours: but when I found a certaine
confusion in the same, besides many repetitions, I
compared it to Protogenes pencill, that throwne
away in a rage, effected that worke, which with
all his cunning hee knew not how to con∣triue;
and so in my conscience, you writ this in
anger, (I will not say in fury) and fortune hath
giuen way to your good spirit, which though
(if men were as angry as your selfe) might be cal∣led
presumption, yet out of iudgment consonant to

to you: non recte dixisti, nec habeo, nec careo, nec
curo: How I proued that, it is so many yeares a∣goe,
I cannot tell: but how I shall proue yours, it is
so few dayes agoe, since I attempted it, that I can
almost say it without booke: yet because a mans
memory may faile, I haue here sent it you written,
if not pinted: now if the worst come, we shall doe
no worse then Lawyers, who fall out with one ano∣ther
at the Barre, and are friends when they meete
at the Temple Hall at dinner: For I can assure
you, I pray that your Muse may haue a Plautus
plaudite,—and though I am so vnfortunate a man
in these compositions, that I may stil exclaime, Ne∣mesis
in tergo—, yet doth my hart leape at the thri∣uings
of other men, and I wish you, the reward of
your worth, remaining to you, to others, to my
selfe, to all, honest:-
