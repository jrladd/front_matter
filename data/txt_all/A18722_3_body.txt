IN trauailing abroad, & searching some secrets at home that closelie would lurke in corners vnknowen, I found (good M. Lieutenant) manie oc∣casions to write off, but none more greeuous to behold than the wan∣dring minds of this world, & sowers of dissention, hatefull to themselues & Enemies to their Countrey, & for reformation of their follies, & amend∣mēt of their liues, I drew certain verses fit for those cau∣ses, and I hope pleasant to read. And because your good mind and office of worthie credit, is as it were a curbe & musrole to hold in such strong-headed wanderers wil∣fully

bent, & wickedly disposed: I did on goodwill dedi∣cate this little Volume to your view and good conside∣ration, knowing that therein is no verse, nor meaning of any matter, but that attends only to the aduauncement of vertue, rebuke of vice, and loyaltie to our Countrey. So wishing you much worshippe, I enter into the dis∣course alreadie heere mentioned.
