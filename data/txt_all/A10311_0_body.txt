MADAME,
TO Vindi∣cate, and de∣liver my self, from the im∣putation of Sarcastick, bitter, too loose, & liberall speaches, agaynst the most Noble, Worthie, and Transcendant Sexe of WOMEN, (which some, kno∣wing their own imperfect weaknesse, may apprehend to be
Calumnies, and detra∣ctiue to the whole Sexe) I here make humble Obla∣tion;
 &, with all Reverence, present vnto your Ladiships Honorable Hands, this litle TREATISE; as a part of my Studie, in my wearisome Journie, this halfe yeare by∣past, in forraygne Coun∣treys.
Which, indeed, MADAME, I aimed for Your La: the last New-years-day; if di∣stresse of weather, and con∣trarie winds, had not hin∣dered.
But, through the mercie of GOD, your La: Servant being safelie arrived, I de∣sire no more, but that this Abortiue may shelter it self
 vnder the shadow of Your La: Honourable Affection. Then may I think my selfe happie, and the payns well bestowed.
Not doubting, but that it shall so plead for me, that by a just judgement of all Your La: most Glorious, Noble, and Gracious Sexe, I shall be pronounced guilt∣lesse, quyte, and free, from all Aspersion, and Imputa∣tion, vnjustlie here to fore layd to my charge.
How-so-ever, Madame, if eyther this Subject maye anie wayes seeme pleasing vnto Your La: or my selfe
 serviceable; all my cited Au∣thors never thought them∣selues halfe so GRACED; as I will continuallie confesse MY FORTVNES HONOVRED.
And, thus, MOST NOBLE, AND GRACIOVS LADIE,
With humble Heart, true mynd, and tempred Brayne,
NED vowes, Your Sexe poore PRINTER to remayne.
