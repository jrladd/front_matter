SIR,
I Have heard you often complain that we see Relations enough of Chi∣na and Canada, but that none had yet appeared which truly declared, what Country Jansenia is. Be content, Sir, here is what you have longed for, ano∣ther would have made a great volume hereof, but
I know how tedious pro∣lixity is to you: I have considered your inclinati∣on, and to tell you all, my own, which does not carry me to that enlargement of speeches which you tearm the profit of the Stationer, and the torment of the Reader. If I had fur∣ther amplified my dis∣course, you would per∣haps have laid it aside, either through contempt or irksomness, as we do great talkers; and many
persons who abridge themselves of their dear∣est satisfaction would have easily bereaved themselves of a Book that had cost more. We may tell many things in seven or eight leafs of pa∣per, and I am mistaken if you find nothing in these that approach Col∣ledge amplifications, or the style of Commenta∣ries. I had believed that the discourse I address unto you should have been
sufficient to satisfie your curiosity, and that of the publick also, but some body advised me to joyn to it the Map which you see here, where in a moment the site of the Country is ex∣pose to the worlds view; the Rivers that water it, and that bind it to the neighbouring kingdomes; the several things that it produceth, and the Sea where all the waters of so famous a Country fall. Some one will perhaps
have a desire to make a more exact and regulate description of it, when he hath seen this, I shall be very glad of it, and I'm sure 'twill have a greater sale in France, than the Almanack that made so much noise, after the De∣claration of Pope Inno∣cent the tenth, and since Jansenisme was beaten down. I would not dare to tell you, that you will do that better than any other, for it would be to excite
you to follow my lights, and I acknowledge that I have none which equal yours. Do then, Sir, what you please; and believe me ever,
