RIGHT REVEREND, AND HONOVRABLE,
I Haue adventured this second time to commend my poore la∣boures to your Honourable pro∣tection. My former were in∣volued in a few paper leaues. In presenting them to your Lordship, I seemed not much vnlike the Samian Poet, Choerilus, who presumed to offer to great ALEXANDER a few harsh verses. Your then favourable acceptance of that litle Sermō, hath emboldned this larger volume to presse into your L. presence. It conteineth coūtry Sermons. They intend principally the reformation of mā∣ners, in such, as desire to liue a godly life in this pre∣sent world. This is the mite, which for this time I cast into Gods treasurie. If I haue done it with your Honoures good liking, I shall the lesse regard,
 what bitter tongues shall say. Censurers I will not heed. I know whose liveries they walke in. It must be an admirable piece of worke, that shall haue their approbation. Against such I oppose a wall of brasse: VVhat I doe, I doe it only to discharge some little parte of that duty, which I owe vnto Gods peo∣ple through my Ministery. I may not longer detaine your Lordship. God Almighty so blesse your governement in his Church among vs, that the bounds of the Gospell of CHRIST may be en∣larged, that faithfull Pastors may be comforted, that the enimies of true religion may be suppres∣sed, that the glory of God in all may be advanced.
 From my Study in CORPVS CHRISTI COL∣LEGE in OXFORD, Iuly 5. 1613.
