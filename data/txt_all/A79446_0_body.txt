SIR,
I Have often desired an Op∣portunity to testifie both to your self, and the World, how much I honour your transcendent Learning. This Peece comming to my hands to translate, I pit ch'd upon your self to beg your patronage for it. Some perhaps may urge, it deserves not your Acceptance: the greater then will your Candour appear in desen∣ding
at from the overhasty censure of rash Criticks. It was a Speech made to the famous Cardinall Ri∣chelieu, who is acknowledged by all to have been the grand Politick States man, either of his own, or pre∣cedent times. But neither this, nor the Cardinals good Approbation of it, are the onely causes of my Dedi∣cation.
This, Sir, is an excellent Founda∣tion for a beautifull Structure. It Containes an exact Method for the trayning up of youth in all manner of Sciences, and in so short a time as no former Age afforded the like: and I am confident this our Present cannot choose but approve of. But to take a∣way all Scrupulous doubts, from the common Reader, whether our Author hath set down the right way to atcheive this so laudable an Enterprise, I ap∣peale to your Judicious Approbation. If You think my labour well bestowed, I shall think my felf happy: if not, I
must fry to your Courteous Clement assuring my selfe of your pardon for my bold Intrusion, which I hope you will look upon as only my Ambition to deerve the Title of
Sir
