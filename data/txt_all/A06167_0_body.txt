MY honoured good Lord, ha∣uing resolued with my selfe to publish certaine my poems, and knowing them subiect to much preiudice, except they were graced with some noble and worthie patron: I haue followed the example of Metabo, king of the Uolschi, who desirous to deliuer his onelie daughter from all perill and danger, conse∣crated and dedicated hir to the sister of the sunne. So I no lesse carefull of my labors, then

the king of his Camilla, with deliberate and ad∣uised iudgement, wholy deuote, and offer vp my poems to your fauour and protection: who being the true Maecenas of the Muses, and iu∣diciall in their exercises, are of power to relieue my weaknes, by your worthines, and to priui∣ledge me from enuie, though she were prest to deuoure me: If midst your generall fauour to all desert, your honour vouchsafe this particu∣lar benefite to my industrie, no day, or time, (as Tully counsaileth) shall define the memorie of your benefits, but as your noble father in mine infancie, with his owne hands incorporated me into your house, so in this my retired age and studie, my labour, lines, and whole life, shall be imployed to doe you honour and seruice.
