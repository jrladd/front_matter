Right Honourable:
HOW needfull it is to haue alwayes at hand diuers helps and furtherances to godlinesse, and to be of∣ten conuersant in Meditation
 and Prayer, and such like ho∣ly and religious Exercises, none can be ignorant, who is eyther priuie to his owne naturall indisposition and vn∣towardnesse vnto that which is good, or otherwise a dili∣gent obseruer of the sundry occasions whereby the affe∣ctions are distracted, and with-drawne from that, on which they ought chiefely to be placed; or lastly, not for∣getfull of the subtiltie and stratagems of that old and malicious enemie, in seeking by all meanes, eyther to keepe men from entering into the right way, or else to diuert them from it, being once
 entred into it, by laying many stumbling-blocks in the way, or insnaring them with the al∣luring baites of the lying and deceiueable vanities of this fading and perishing world, with which many are so strangely inchanted, that whiles they fondly thinke therein to finde felicitie, they runne on head-long vnto vt∣ter ruine and destruction. Hence it is, that many moued with the zeale of the glory of GOD, and the good of others, (the welfare of whose soules was deere vnto them) haue imployed themselues in see∣king to remedy this euill, by seasoning the affections of
 men with wholesome instru∣ctions, and to preserue them from that danger, which o∣therwise they were like to fall into through the craft and malice of that deadly aduer∣sary, who desires nothing more, then to make a prey of them, and to drowne their soules in perdition, without all hope of recouery. And this indeede it was, that first induced mee (being also mo∣ued thereunto by the often and importunate request of godly & wel-disposed friends) to publish this Treatise for the benefit of others, and to proceede in the course which vpon the like considerations,
 I had formerly enterprised. The Worke I acknowledge to be slender, yet such as I hope may not be without profit to those that are sin∣cerely affected; and not sicke, eyther of that euill disease of vaine and fond curiosity, which raignes among too many: or else of that spirituall sur∣fet, which is a cause of much hurt, not to a few, whose di∣stemper causeth them to loath better and more sauory dishes then this, which I here set before them, not hauing in∣deede any relish in any thing which is not fitted to their Aguish and disordered appe∣tite. Whatsoeuer it be, I
 presume to send it forth into the light, vnder your Ho∣nourable Patronage. Why I should vse this boldnesse; a∣mong others, this was not the least incitement; namely, considering that your Lo: hath not onely beene a Pa∣tron of the Labours of diuers in this or the like nature: but also an Honourable and wor∣thy Instrument for the en∣trance of many into that chiefe and maine worke of the Ministerie, dealing there∣in with much sinceritie and faithfulnesse (a thing so rare in this decayed and corrup∣ted age, wherein eyther Flat∣tery or such like sinister re∣spects,
 or (which is worse,) Briberie and Simonie, haue so much defiled and defaced the Lords Sanctuary, to the losse of many soules, which haue perished by meanes of such execrable and sacrilegi∣ous impietie.) I thought it my dutie, to take occasion here∣by, of ioyning with others in publishing to the world your sincere and religious care here∣in towards the Church of God (which shall no doubt in due time be more abun∣dantly recompenced1 Cor. 11.15.58. Gal. 6.9.;) not so much to stirre vp your noble and generous minde, to conti∣nue in that honourable and worthy course, vvherein I
 know right well your Christi∣an and constant resolution and forwardnesse, as to prouoke others of your, or inferiour order, to whom that great and weightie businesse is com∣mitted, to follow your steps, that thereby they may parti∣cipate with you in the like de∣serued praise, and so the Church fare the better for them; which they ought to account (as it is indeed) their greatest glory: being that wherein Christian Princes and Emperours in former times haue much reioyced, & striuen who should therein exceede and surpasse others. Besides this generall respect, which to∣gether
