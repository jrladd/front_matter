MADAM,
IN stead of imploring alone, your prote∣ction of this little Book; I come like∣wise my self, humbly beseech∣ing you to shelter us under the secure wings of your favour, from those killing frownes and great displeasure, I see sitting on my Mothers angry brows,
occasioned by my fault; if I may call it one. Madam, if you will know what it is, here read it in my hand; it is the publi∣cation of this little Book, which I felloniously laid hands on, knowing very well my Mothers humility, that will not suffer publickly her pen to speak her praise, till she chang∣es this life for a better. As soon as I had possest my selfe of this rare Jewell, (as I take it) I came running with it to your Ladyship, as being only wor∣thy of the first sight thereof, and with all knowing, that the great influence you have over my dear Mother, will smooth her brow when she lookes on
me, if you but give the word, fiat. As for the Book, your ve∣ry name prefixt to it, carries with it such virtue and effica∣cy, that it hath equall power with the Sun to dissipate all vaprous exhalations, that ob∣loquie can raise against it. Par∣don, Madam, I beseech you my ambition and folly in this dedication, since I have done, as one that would invite Great Jove, to be a Patron to a little Gnat. But I hope your usuall clemency will stand my Medi∣ator, I shall for beare to speak of encomiums proper to your selfe, since we all know, the very naming you, is a suffici∣ent Trumpet to sound your
worth. May your Lady-ship please; to accept of this small gift from a hand, that would erect statues of Piramids to the honour of your everlast∣ing name, and I shall haste, as being eagerly proud to sub∣scribe my selfe.
