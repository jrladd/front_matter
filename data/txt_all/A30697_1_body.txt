Sirs,
A Short Epistle best sutes a short discourse, you may remember I gave to you a hint formerly, that some Citizens were endeavouring a refor∣mation of and provision for the necessitous poor in our City, which would be an example and inducement to all the Kingdom to doe the like. It is now in some probability of effecting: An Ordinance is past both Houses, creating a Corporation for that purpose, which Ordinance being (as is conceived) not full enough, some additions thereto are by the Corporation desired, which is the present obstruction, and will doubtlesse be removed as soon as the emergent businesse of State will admit. In the meantime I thought good to give you this account, it being one of the most probable waies to promote it with You in my own native County, and after through the whole Kingdom: and being effectually and conscionably perform∣ed, will, doubtlesse, remove from us many evils, disorders, clamours and tumults, and procure upon us the blessings promised to them that consider the poor, The Lord will de∣liver them in the day of trouble. Despair not because it hath been long preparing: great bodies move slowly, and good designes take not effect as could be desired. I had thought to have given you the summe of the discourse, but on second

thoughts, I conceived it better to refer you to the relation at large, the which, if you shall approve, doe your endeavour to doe your County that service to promote so good a work, which will be a blessing to the poor, and a comfort to the rich. The Lord direct and assist You. So praieth,

London, March 16, 1649.
