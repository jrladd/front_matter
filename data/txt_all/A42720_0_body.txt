SIR,
DRawn by your Commands from my poor but quiet shade into the open Sun, I should be affraid it would be too bright and too hot for me, if I was not assured of the advantages of a shade from your lustres. You shine with the Rays of a generous integrity in all your references which way soever they point, particularly that Publick Office which you now bear you have managed with so Noble and Powerful à light of Loyalty to your great Master, and of Equity, Discretion, Goodness, and Honour towards all, that the evil eyes which some disaffected to His Majestie's Government have cast upon you, have thereby been dazzled, and had their Malignant beams, when they could meet with nothing unbecoming in you to fix upon, with no little vexation reflected upon themselves, upon their own unworthiness and untowardness. The only Cloud by which you could be thought to suffer was made for an hour by my Blacks in the Pulpit. And I acknowledge that your Glories when lookt upon through me, must have a faint as∣pect. You might have had enow who would have serv'd you in my place with better and more agreeable Skill, none with honester Design. My De∣sign was to promote that fear of God which lies in the fearing and honouring of the King, that which I knew would be Satisfactory to you and to all other good Men. To which purpose I undertook for my Sub∣ject a Text of Scripture which the Ʋnlearned have wrested to a far diffe∣rent Sense, and I wish they may so repent, that they may not do it also to their own Destruction. Whether I left (as I have been accused) ei∣ther my Text, or (considering the juncture of Affairs) my Auditory, I leave the unprejudiced to judge. Indeed as the Israelites were wicked
in their manner of asking a King, not in the matter that they askt, I might also be faulty in my manner of handling their wickedness; but I dare affirm I was not in the matter which I thereupon asserted. Not Art, but Truth was my Business. And what if some were stung, swell'd and opened their Mouths? It was because Truth met closely with very much vitiated intelligence and humour. That this may appear, what I Preach't I have Printed, without either Substraction or Addition; without Sub∣straction, because what I said I am ready to defend; without Addition, because I would have some Reserves for Defence in case of Assault. But here give me leave to add that Prayer for the King, which I then forgot in winding up my Discourse, which Tertullian says, The Primitive Chri∣stians always used for the Emperors, and in which I assure my self you and all other his truly Christian Subjects will joyn, that he may have Vitam prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, Senatum fidelem, populum probum, orbem quietum, quae∣cun{que} hominis & Caesaris vota sunt: urging it so much farther, That if he should not have Senatum: fidelem and populum probum, yet he may not miss of having exercitus fortes, that so no disloyalty, no ma∣lice, no seditious or rebellious practisings may be able to hinder him from having Vitam prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, &c. And this also, that whereas St. Augustine says Regum est, non esse sine comitum obsequio, he may have neither Comitem nor Vice-Comitem nor Comitatum, which does not esteem this obsequiousness to him their Duty, and study to perform it. As for your self, who will never fail of doing so, my Prayer is that you may live long to be, as you are, a very excellent and influential Exemplar of Allegiance to your Prince, and of such other Vertues as are suitable to your Character, and the Complexion of your Concerns. I am,
SIR,
