BOund to your eternall
seruice, (diuinest of all Vir∣gine
creatures) both in honour
of your renowned Grandfa∣ther,
to whom my Name was
euer immortallie obliged, and
your excellence admired, as
farre as admiration hath force
to conuay true praises; and lastlie, coniured by an vnre∣sistable
edict, from them to whom my lifes course is all
onelie enthralled, with humble reuerence I offer to your

mayden censure, these hallowed lines, metamorphosed by
mine vnhallowed sences; daine thē (deare flower of deare
virginnitie) with gracious aspect to smile vpon mine in∣fant
Muses deuotion, and in dispight of tirannizing time,
lende life to my labour and loue to Salomon. Then your
selfe, no power is greater, and with your power is equall
no worke of Nature; bee then your selfe the powerfull
Engine to sustaine my fortunes, and my fortunes the first
created, to make knowne your power, that when mine
vnfeathered Muse shall be impt by your graces, shee may
straine her vntuned numbers to sing of you and your ado∣red
Father, whom heauen holds to make happie her habi∣tation,
earth wants to giue wonder to her age, and men
wishe to make mightie their fortunes.
Happie inough if I please inough.
