My Lord, and Ladies,
I Have performed this small Service, to the Memory of one deserving to be had in everlasting Remembrance!
The Part of it which concerns her Heavenly Vertues, claimeth as its undoubted Right, and is sure to have, your most honourable Testimo∣ny. Although the whole be so blemish'd with the Author's Imperfections, that it deserveth his Blush, and needeth your Pardon!
A Pardon, whereof he despairs not; because, through your overflowing Affection unto the Deceased, You have pleased to honour me with many great Favours. And because, as every one seeth, the Greatest and the Best Persons be not the hardest to please!
My Gratitude shall ever keep my Prayer ascending to the Almighty, for your noble Fa∣mily!
Whereof, so renowned Relatives, as your Lordship's incomparable Mother, the Illustrious Roger Earl of Orrery, and the im∣mortal Mr. Robert Boil, have long ago obliged me to be a true Votary!
May your Redeemer's Grace hold you safe upon the Precipices of your Prosperity! And make your secular Grandeurs to become Testi∣monies of his present Favour, and Pledges of your future Felicity!
May your Persons and Off-spring be Bles∣sings to this World! And when you are Transla∣ted to the next, May you carry the Peace of God with you, and leave the Praise of Men behind you.
