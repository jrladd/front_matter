My Lord,
SInce the Papists who have of late so notoriously appeared to be the Grand and Implacable Enemies of this Kingdom, by De∣signing the destruction of His Ma∣jesties Person and Government, and the Protestant Religion, left to us by our Ancestors, have been so wicked∣ly Industrious to promote their curs∣ed Opinions among the Ignorant, as they have demonstrated by that
 vast number of Popish Primers, Catechisms, Manuals, and a multi∣tude of such Romish Trash and Trumpery, which they intended to have dispersed like a General In∣fection among the youth of this Na∣tion, if they had not been happily seized, and justly committed to the Flames, since the discovery of the Damnable and Horrid Popish Plot; I am confident it cannot be unaccepti∣ble to your Lordship, if I endeavour to strengthen and confirm this young Generation in Protestant Princi∣ples, by the methods whereby they in∣tended to Debauch them; This My Lord is the Design of this little
 Book, which being seriously consi∣dered, will discover an horrible pro∣spect of the Tyranny and cruelty of that Bloody Religion, and will ob∣lige all good Christians and Prote∣stants, by all lawful ways and means to oppose to the utmost the putting our necks under that slavish Yoke, which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear, and which of all Judgements we may beseech Almigh∣ty God to deliver us from; which is the daily prayer of
My Lord,



My Lord, my weak Endeavours out have too
The Sum and Substance of The Martyrs Book;
Arotection and Acceptance if you give,
It shall, as shall your Lordship ever live.
My Lord, the lives & deaths of Saints & Kings,
This little Book unto your Lordship sings.
For pardon and protection I intreat,
The Volumes Little my Presumption Great.
