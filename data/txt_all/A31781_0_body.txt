Reader,
AMongst the many sad objects of pitty and commise∣ration which these dayes afford and do bring forth here is one not of the least, where thou may behold the sad and woful sufferings of many of the dear and preci∣ous servants of the Lord, who have denied themselves and the glory of this World, that so they might be followers of Christ, and doers of his Will, that so they might receive peace with the Father through Jesus Christ, who hath called us to suffer for his Names sake, and be conformable unto his Will, that so the Crown of Glory may be received, which is laid up for all them that keep the faith, and doth not deny it, nor him in whom-they have believed, before men, as these Cloud of Witnesses and faithful suffererers have done, who have kept the Faith, and confessed him before men, and a∣mong such also where the Devil hath his Throne, and rules as King; and by his unrighteous Scepter hath the Rulers of Che∣ster acted, as the Discourse hereafter will manifest, wherein thou may see the Image of the Father in the sufferers, and of the Lamb, who was dumb before the Shearer, and opened not his mouth: And in this after written thou may see the Scriptures fulfilled, as it is written by the Prophets, They eat my people as men eat bread, and they chop them in pieces as flesh; for the Caldron and the time which Christ spoke of is come, that they that kill you shall think they do God service, & all these things they wil do unto you for my Names sake, and they shall shamefully entreat you, & cast you into prison, & speak all manner of evil of you falsly for my Names sake; but blessed are they who are not offen∣ded. And in those blood thirsty inhumane Magistrates (so called) who have done all this violence and cruelty, thou may

also read the image of the Devil brought forth, for their works that they have done and wrought are of him; and as Christ said to them who would have been counted holy, who said God was their Father, but their Works manifested them to be of the Devil, and he was their Father who abode not in the truth. And that which makes the violence & cruelty more intollerable of these men, is, because they profess themselves to rule for God, & are christian Magistrates, but their actions that they have brought forth will Christ never own, for he came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them; neither did he ever set up any such rule as to slay his servants, nor any such Magistrates who are a terror to them that do well, and there∣fore they must be recorded among the Adversaries of the Lord▪ whom the Lord will dash to pieces. What! Is this the reformation brought forth in their City, imprisoning them that reprove sin in the Gate, and set drunkards at liberty? Oh preposterous and prodigeous cruelty! In the time of the King, and in the time of the Bishops, never such presidents of cruelty was found, and this hypocritical generation will be lesse excusable then they, they in ignorance, but these in the day, when light is declared abroad, and have been warned; they never professed liberty of concience, but these do; they never professed toleration or protection unto any but them that conformed to them in all things, but these do. Oh Eng∣land! Is thy Sun set when it was but new risen? and utter) darknesse coming upon thee again? And must this be fulfil∣led upon thy Rulers, and among them, They are all evening. Wolves, who devour so greedily, that they gnaw not the bones till the Morrow? Oh unheard-of cruelty! unparelell'd Wickednesse! violence is broken forth into a Rod, and now smiteth the just in great cruelty, and the innocent in great rage; but all these things are recorded and taken notice of by him who weighs all things in an even ballance, and will scatter the wiced and ungodly as Chaff, and as dust shall they be blown away; but all the stripes, reproaches, sighs, tears, and sufferings of the upright will he reward, when their ene∣mies shall sink as a stone into the Sea, and be overwhelmed

in the pit of everlasting vengeance, wo and misery, which▪ is prepared for the old Dragon, the Devourer and all his Seed and Race for ever, who would not have Righteousnesse to rule, nor Innocency to live, but subtilty and craft, pride and arrogancie, in which the Kingdom of the Devil stands, and envy, murder and oppression, and he that hates his Brother is a man-slayer. And when thou hast read over this Discourse and sees the envy, wickedness, and madness, and cruelty of these Rulers, their spirit thou will see, and cannot but ab∣hor as detestable, and may truly say, While such bear rule, the Land cannot but mourn; but the mischief they have hat∣ched shall fall upon their own pate, and peace shall possesse the reins of the just, and the heart of them that have suffer∣ed shall rejoice and be glad in him who hath counted them worthy to suffer for his Names sake, and great shall be their reward, for they shall reign with him for ever and ever over all their Enemies, and shall trample them down under their feet; which if thou believe, and in patience endure and suffer with them that suffer, thou shalt rejoice with them that rejoice, in the joy which is unspeakable and full of glory, and know the Dominion which is everlasting, when all those un∣righteous powers and dominions shal come to an end; and all that endure to the end, and keep the faith, this shall see ful∣filled; and the Lord is hastening it for Wiekedness is near at the heighth, and then his Wrath shall consume his Enemies, and they shall melt away that hate the Lord.
