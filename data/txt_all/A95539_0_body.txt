TO the high and mighty Davidius Vulcanus, Duke and Dominator of the Dunghils, and absolute, reso∣lute, dissolute, Scavenger of the Town and Territories of Gravesend in Norfolk, great Master and Baron of the Wheel-barrow, the only Farmer, Transporter, Lord of the Soyle, and Privy searcher of all Mixens, and Muckhils, simple or compound, in the Liberties aforesaid. Cleanser, Clearer, and avoyder of the most Turpitudi∣nous, Merdurinous, excrementall offals, Muck, and Garbage. Refiner, Purger, Clarifier, Purifier, Mundi∣fier, Excluder, and Expulser of Putrifactious and Pesti∣ferous Contagions; the Potentissimo, Excellentissi∣mo, Invader, Scatterer, Disperser, Consumer, and Con∣founder of offensive unsavoury savours, smels, scents, and Vapours: Great Soldan, Sultan, and Grand Signiour over all varieties of stinks, and stinkards; most Trium∣phant Termagant, vnresistable Conquerour and Com∣mander of the major and minor (the great and the less) Turditanians, chief Corrigidor & Beadle of all the Pre∣cinct, sole Transplanter, Terrifier, Controler, and Cor∣rector of Beggers and Vagabonds. The terrible Hue and Cry, Cryer, chiefe Court-Cryer, Jayle-Keeper, and only Consiner of the Hogs; chiefe and most frequent vigilant Watchman, demy-Constable, and Image of Au∣thority, the most accomplished Cobler, exquisite Transla∣tor,
and exact Reformer of oppressed, decayed, wicked, & oppressed soals: And the only judiciary rectifier, un∣derlayer, and setter upright of such Brethren and Si∣sters as doe goe aside, and tread their foot awry in these dayes of Vanity, and paths of Iniquity: In hope (Great Sir) I have not abated you of the least tittle of your title, your Honorable stile being so high, that no Christian, Pagan, Heathen, Turk, Jew, Infidell, Cuckold, or Can∣niball, can never climb to the top of it, there being a late report that your multiplicity and many affaires of State have disturbed your rest, & impaired your health, insomuch as it is thought your pericranion is crazed or cracked, and you thereby in danger to fall into a Callen∣turian disease, which is to be doubted may produce a Ver∣tigo in your head, wherby your wit may be troubled with a superfluous flux, which may prove a molestation to your selfe, and the whole Town, that hath in it selfe, and in every place round about it, more troubles then they can well bear. But if their hard fortune should be, that when you are working to your own Ends, and that you should call for your Aule, and death should mistake and bring you your Last, whereby such a privy member as your selfe might be publickly lost; it is feared, griefe would overflow the whole Town, and that some of the Townesmen (with the help of their Wives) would run starke horne mad: To prevent this great detriment of such a losse as that Town may undergo in this time of scarcity of wit, wisdome, and wise men; for feare you should fall into the dangerous diseases of the Mubble∣fubbles, or the grumbling of the Gizzard: Therefore to drive away dumps, and to give you some Recreati∣on,
I have made bold to present your greatnesse with this Dedication, which if you will vouchsafe but to read and understand, and in so doing you shal do more for the Authour, then he ever was or shall do himselfe.
