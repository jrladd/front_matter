My Lord,
THese Sermons now pub∣lished, do (pardon the expression) challenge your Lordships Name to be praefixed before them, as yours in point of Right. They were
preached in your Diocese, where I now reside; and are the First-Fruits of my poor Labours exposed to the World, and upon that score, ought to be offered into your Lord∣ships Hands. It is not a curious Itch of Popular Applause which hath drawn me into Print, (I could never fancy any thing of mine de∣served any Persons notice.) Nor will I alleadge the Importunity of Friends as a Ground of this Ʋnder∣taking; (though sometimes suffici∣ently sollicited.) But to say truth, The Auditors were so ingenuous as favourably to accept them when Preached, which makes me hope they may be serviceable from the Press, as they seemed to be from
the Pulpit. Such as they are, I humbly present them to your Lord∣ship, as a real Testimony how much I am
My Lord, 
Leicester Novem. 9. 1669.
