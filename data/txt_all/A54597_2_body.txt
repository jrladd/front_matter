SIR,
I Am here, a confined Person, for my being too kind to others, and too unjust to my self▪ and for not doing what was not in my Power to perform, by wanting the Justice of my Debtors, whereby I am rather a Prisoner to them than to my Creditors.
Yet I can dispense with all these, because they have occasi∣oned my happiness, in your Acquaintance, and my contenting Retirement in this place, which was once a Palace, after, a Staple of Comerce, and long since and still, a Repository of our Laws: And now, like Homers Iliads in a Nut-shell, here are all sorts of Degrees, from Prince to Peasant, all sorts of Pro∣fessions, from the Doctor to the Novice; all sorts of Trades and Manufactures, and all sorts of Virtues; but your Prudence doth still suppress the Vices.
And I ingeniously confess, that by yours, & your Ladies con∣stant Kindness & Indulgence to my declining years, I have made it a Colledge of Learning, and so may other Gentlemen do (if they please) it being so qualified, that in an hours time there is no Art or Science wherein one may not be punctually instructed.
Now, Those that think themselves Prisoners to you are much mistaken, for they are Prisoners to the LAWS, and may make themselves Students of All-Souls in Le Fleet, of which you are Warden.
A Guardian-ship very needful for the People, as a Completion of JƲSTICE, in point of Restraints: For, (besides many other wise Considerations) they are good for Cooling the Animosities between Creditors and Debtors, and between the LAWS and Contemners of them, (and thereby prevents the Effusion of Blood, which hath often hapned) and for Curing the sullen and contemptuous Dispositi∣on of others to their Superiours.

For, I can truly say, That, by my patient Submission to them and my Misfortunes (being prepared with my 14 months Impri∣sonment in Windsor Castle, under the late usurped Power) I do now with more Satisfaction to my self, undergo this under a Le∣gal Power, and thereby I affirm, That no Gentleman hath receiv'd greater Respects from you than my self, and therefore I take this Occasion to make my publick Ac∣knowledgments, that it may be a Guid to other mens Con∣tentments, for, as I have observ'd, That as you never were out-Hector'd by Affronts or Resistances, so you were never out-done by Civilities or Compliableness to your Methods.
As to the first▪ I never gave Occasion, and as to the other, my studious temper complying with your Love to Learning have so won on your good Disposition, that I must acknow∣ledg to my honored Subscribers, and others, that had it not been for your Incouragement and particular Assistance with your purse; (though with some Inconveniencies to your own Occa∣sions) I could not have finished this Book, as now I have done, and therefore as one Memorial of your kindness, I have given it the name of FLETA, and in my Picture minted the word insletatus from this Place.
I could with delight to my self and others, spend more time on this Subject; but I must end with this request, That as you have given House-room here to the whole Impression of my Books, so you will please (in respect my person is restrain'd in Execution of the Laws,) to encourage it in its Travels a∣broad; and so not doubting of your Favour, I shall conclude with Ovid (then, in my present Condition, but I will not pu∣nish my self with his Tristibus's,)
Parve nec invideo sine me Liber ibis in Aulam Ʋrbem
Which I have thus Englisht,
Go little Book, leave me, but make report,
Who treats thee best, the City or the Court.
However you shall have the continuing thanks of
