Madam,
I Cannot properly call this, my first fruits; I cannot, in respect of my self; but, in respect of this first Dedication to your Ladiship, I can; for as yet, I never had any thing, worthy your honours Accep∣tance; neither is this: It is not, in respect of the Author, it is not; but in respect of the matter, it is: the Matter, hea∣venly Praiers, and Almes deeds, done in Faith, as a sweet smelling sacrifice, accepted of God; the tears and godly sorrow, of all humble, and penitent Sinners, as the like sacrifice, accepted of our Saviour, who here pro∣miseth. I will give you Rest, and, according to his pro∣mise, will reward hereafter. Behold I come quickly, and my Reward is with meRev. 22.12.. So it is, eternal rest,
 eternal life, is a promised Reward, on our Saviours part, (and he will perform his Promise) to all, that in the Race set before them, in this life, run, and wrestle, and strive, to obtain, that promised Reward, This is the short summe of the two following Sermons: which I send forth into the World, under your Honours name; yet, not, as Noah (doubtfully) sent forth the Dove out of the Ark,Gen. 8. ver. 9.10, &c. to try, by some Sign, or other, whether the Waters of the floud were asswaged, or not, No; but, confident∣ly, knowing that the Floud of Gods wrath is asswaged towards all that truely repent, and faithfully believe in his beloved Son▪ who here saith, Come unto me, this I send forth, as a witness (I confess) out of due time; yet, as a witness still, that it is so; 'tis the joy of my heart, to write it: 'tis a greater joy, to believe it, and, my confidence is, that I do not, I shall not, present this in vain to your Ladyship, who (I know) is also fully per∣swaded, that it is so.
Madam, I am
