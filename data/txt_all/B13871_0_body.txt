MOST GRATIOVS AND DREAD SOVERAINE,
NOthing can so much concern a man to seeke for, as life eternall; the onely meanes to finde this eternall life, is the knowledge of God; there is no meanes to know God, (to purpose,) but by his Word; this word, though plaine, and cleare in the maine truthes, yet wants not some difficulties, in other expressions; the explication of these difficulties, is (for a great part) the occasion, and matter of our Sermons, Lectures, Commentaries; every man holding it both an high honour, and an happy service to be Gods trucheman to
