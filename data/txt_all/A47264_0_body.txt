Thrice Noble and truely Vertuous Lady,
AFter mature delibera∣tion, what to tender unto your acceptance worthy your Patro∣nage, nothing occurred more probable, than this small Ma∣nuall; which was once esteem∣ed as a rich Cabinet of know∣ledge,

by a person truely Ho∣norable. May it auspitiously procure but your Honours like friendly Estimation, and then I doubt not, but it will find a uni∣versall acceptance amongst per∣sons of greatest Eminency. Sure I am, it may be justly deem∣ed as a rich magazene of ex∣perience, having long since taught the world its approved excellency, yea, even in many dangerous exigencies. All I humbly crave for tht present is, my bouldnesse might be favour∣ablely excused, since twas my lawfull ambition, thereby to a∣void ingratitude for the many singular favours I have already

received from your endeared truely Honorable Husband, my always true noble friend, and most happy Country-man. God multiplie his blessings on all your noble Family, and make you no lesse honourable heer on Earth, than Eternally happy hereafter: which shall be the daily prayer of him, whose highest Emulation is,
