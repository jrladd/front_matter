Madam,
SINCE my small and short Ac∣quaintance with your Ladyship, I could not but be one of the Admi∣rers (amongst ma∣ny others) of your great Gravity, and peculiar Piety in this our loose and debauched Age: Whereas other La∣dies of Honour doth glory in this, that they are La∣dies

of Pleasure too. (Alas, they do but glory in their own shame, Phil. 3. 19.) Your Ladyship doth e∣steem it your grea∣test Glory, not on∣ly to be a Lady of Honour, but also a Lady of Holiness. This is abundantly demonstrated not only by your re∣pairing [duely] to the publick means of Grace, where you may enjoy them in power and purity, but also (to my knowledge) your upholding [daily] the private worship of God in your Family. This, this is that which

makes you [truly] Honourable, and therefore ought to be honoured (as you are of God, so) of all good men, but especial∣ly of all good Mi∣nisters. In pursu∣ance whereof, I make hold to pre∣sent to your Lady-ship (the best Ho∣mage and Honour I can pay you) this Christian Mirror; which is a Loo∣king-glass for an elect Lady, for a Lady indeed. I doubt not, but while other Ladies (in their Vanitie) do, as it were, nail their very Eyes to their literal Loo∣king-glass,

and that onely for pluming the body as to man; your Ladyship will be improving this mystical Looking-glass for the trim∣ming of your Soul as to God, that your inner man may be∣come as amiable & acceptable to your Heavenly Hus∣band, Isa. 54. 5. as your outward man is to your Earthly one.
