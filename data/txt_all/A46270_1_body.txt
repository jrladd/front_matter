Most Royal, Honourable, and truly Worthy.
ALthough Poets and Poetry
(which the best ages for∣merly
had in an exalted
Estimation) are, in these
loose latter times so discrowned and dis∣couraged,
that the very Name is made
but a Title of Infamy, and their inspi∣red
Persons considered but in the need∣less
number of metrical Mendicants;
(because Poverty and Poetry are such
Correlatives) yet I hope those Persons
to whom I direct my Endeavours, and

squint-eyed souls of rustick capacities
render them.

I remember (very opportunely) that
I once presented a Manual of Meeter to
a very popular Physician of this City in
Oliver's time, who made me no better
return, then that He hated Poetry; after
which words such a judgement fell up∣on
him, that he hath lien sweating un∣der
the heavy displeasure of Venus ever
since. I could tell you more and worse
punishments that have fallen upon such
Hereticks, but I should then make my
Epistle exceed the length of my Book,
and your patience; which I fear I shall
preserve to suffer more by the Saw of
my rude Compositions, although never
