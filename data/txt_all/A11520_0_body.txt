My most Honoured Lord,
THe Author of this Excellent Historie was the same wise and worthy Frier, who of late with so great iudgement and fidelitie hath reuealed vnto the
 World that piece of the Mystery of
Iniquity, those Arcana Imperij Ponti∣ficij, in the
History of the Trent Coun∣cell, which shall bee a lasting Mo∣nument of his memorie, and Fame to all Posterity. His owne Coun∣trey-men knew well how to value and reward his Vertues, iudging him a Person capable to assist in their Highest Counsels of State: But at
Rome his goodnesse easily merited the extreme hatred of the
Courtiers (though hee liued and died in the outward Cōmunion of that
Church,) so farre, that they sentenced and martyred him in his Picture (being defeated in their reall attempt vpon his Person) as a
Mezzo Lutherano, an Heretique, such as are, in their account, all those that cannot be∣leeue
 that thirteenth Article of the Roman Creed, Subesse Romano Ponti∣fici &c. est de necessitate salutis. In these Annals Your Lordship may see the naturall Power of all Soueraigne Princes and Law-giuers, first rudely assaulted by Him who will needs bee Perpetuall Dictator at
Rome, and giue Lawes at his pleasure to all the World; then generously asser∣ted and vindicated by that most Pru∣dent and
Illustrious Common-wealth, which though one of the most aged in
Europe, hath still maintained it selfe fresh and flourishing, amidst all the Confusions and Alterations of Italy; an indubitable argument that it is a Body well complexion'd, and found∣ded vpon sollide Rules of good Po∣licy. The Translator presumes to
 put this Piece into Your Honoura∣ble Hands, not as prizing so high∣ly his owne performance (which is but weake like Himselfe, then whom none is more conscious of infirmi∣ties:) but encouraged hereto both by Your Benignity, and by the Dig∣nitie of the Worke it selfe, from which hee knowes Your Lordships Wisedome will draw many serious and important Considerations. Also his priuate
Interests binde him pub∣liquely and vpon all occasions to professe his very very deepe obli∣gation to Your Honour, such as He can neuer satisfie. He could speake largely in Your Praise, and the com∣mon Voice of the People would ac∣quit him from suspition of flatterie (which naturally Hee abhorres,)
 the Kingdome generally being much comforted to obserue the great Iudgement of our most Gracious Soueraigne, and his loue to the Pub∣lique in his choice of so Able and worthy an
Officer: But hee forbears, lest He should offer violence to Your Modesty, and refers Your Good∣nesse to God, and Your owne good Conscience to bee more really re∣compenced. Finally, Hee euery day heartily blesses God to see this Church so happy in so great a Friend, and an Example of Religion, and this State in so great a Patrone and Patterne of Equity. The same
God of Grace continue long Your Lord∣ship an Instrument of his Glory, and multiply all his Mercies vpon Your owne Person, Your most Reli∣gious
 Ladie, and Your Hopefull Children. This is the Prayer of
