SHeweth, That by the Ninth by Law of this Corporation, It is Or∣dered that no Member thereof do prefer any Bill, or Petition to the High Court of Parliament, or any other Jurisdiction for any Sea Cause, without acquainting the Master, Wardens, and Assistants therewith. And your Petitioners finding themselves Agrieved in the Matters following, do Humbly Pray you Honors relief therein.
First, That the Duty of Poundage is an Innovation on your Petitioners, the same not being imposed on them but about these Two Years last past, although they now receive, nor can get any more than formerly. And al∣though the Corporation always did, and still do receive the same Money of the Master of every Vessel, by the Name of Loadsmanage. Pilotage, and Loadsmanage by the said Charter being one and the same Duty.
Secondly, The Charter provides, That the Channels, Sands, Flats and Rocks in, or near the Sea Coasts, shall for the more Safety and Strength of the Kingdom, be kept secret within our Selves, and altogether un∣known to Straingers. And that therefore no Alien, or Strainger Born, shall Sail, or Serve in any Ship, coming in or going out of the River of Thames, unless for urgent Causes to be certified under the Seal of the Corporation, That contrary to the said Charter, Straingers and Aliens, and Unlicensed Pilots are suffered to Pilot Ships, whereby the Strength and Safety of the Kingdom (which the Charter taketh so much care to have kept secret) is discovered, and your Petitioners grately Injured in the loss of the Money they ought to receive for such Pilotage, which the Aliens under some other name do Pay to this Corporation.
Thirdly, That of late a Bond not mentioned in the Charter, nor required by the By-Laws, have been Imposed upon your Petitioners, with condition for their Civil Demeanor, Comportment, and Obedience to your Orders; and notwithstanding their Civil Demeanor, Comportment, and Obedience, divers of your Petitioners have been Arested lately, and troubled by such Bonds, to their almost utter Ruin; and were not discharged until they had paied the Innovated Duty of Puondage; to raise which, some of them were forced to sell their Goods. And your Petitioners do conceive, if they shall be compelled to Seal such Bonds, they are not to be Arested for any Matter out of the Condition.
