RIght worthie MADAME Hauing in my handes an ab∣hortiue infant, which
 hath a father, but wan∣teth a mother, my breast (the tables wherein I euer write the loues of those to whom I am obliged) had many impulsions, hamblie to present this litle gift to your protection; encoura∣ged in this, that honora∣ble persons, doe not bal∣lance oblations according to their bignes; nor weigh so much the gifte, as the good will of the giuer; nor yet respect the matter, but the mind of the offerer
You are not ignorant, that euen the verie left
 things in this world, ar of∣ten times those which, of the most noble & curious of all, are chieflie required. Orient pearles are litle in quantitie, but riche in apri∣ment. Archimides sphere cōtained no more in its en∣closure, saue onlie the big∣nes of a hazell nut, but for that it so ingeniouslie re∣presented what so euer was admirable in the mo∣tion of the heauens, it rauished the spirits of all behoulders
Holie Scripture doth also teache vs, that the
 daughter of kinge Pharao was not offended at the lit∣tlenes of Moyses (whom she termed so, because she tooke him foorth of the vvaters) moued vvith pit∣tie and commiseration to∣ward him, by reason of the singular beautie vvhich shined in him.
This motherles childe, of far greater price then any Orient pearle, admi∣rably surpassing Alchimi∣des Sphere, & shining in al sort of beautie like the in∣fāt Moyses, might happelie neuertheles haue incurred
 like misfortune, if he had not had the good hap, to be taken vp into the armes of so worthy a mother as your selfe, far surpassing Kin∣ge Pharaos daughter, in pittie, compassion, vvith many other diuine and ho∣lie virtues, vvhereof that vnchristian Queene must needes be incapable.
Conceiue then (Right Curteous Madam I doe be∣seech you) of this my pre∣sent, as of a pearle of vn∣speakeable price, or at the least, as of a Messenger by vvhom I sende you, my
 best, my truest, and hartiest eire of your spiritual pro∣fit & aduancemēt in virtu. If I haue offended in presu∣ming to write without suf∣ficient pretext, to so wor∣thie a person your self (vir∣tuous Madam) be pleased at the least to disburthen me of some part of the bla∣me, finding my selfe bound here vnto, by the sundrie bondes of honor, benigni∣tie, with diuers most sin∣gular fauours which you haue demonstrated both vnto me, and to myne: which, together with your
 gular pietie and zeale to virtu, haue pressed my pen, in part to acquit me of mine owne dutie, and of your desert Wishing you conti∣nuall encrease of all vir∣tues, with long life, health, and happines in this world and euerlasting life in the next, I take my leaue, Re∣mayning euermore.
