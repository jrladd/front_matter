Sir,
THe Author of this Treatise
unwilling to affix his name,
gave me the liberty to de∣dicate
the same to whom I
would: So I knew none that
I was more obliged unto then your self, or
did better understand this Treatise, in
regard you are Landlord, and an Impro∣ver
of Lands, and so capable of putting
in Practice some new Discoveries offered
to the Publick. If you have any Lei∣sure
to peruse the same, I hope you may
with your Pen leave such a Platform for
your hopeful Heir, your great Grandchild,
Sir Henry Winchcomb my Kinsman;

That if God shall bless him with health,
he may follow your Directions as may most
improve his Estate; that when God shall
be pleased to take you out of this wither∣ing
Durance, he may survive you, and be
the main Prop and Lustre in your Fa∣mily,
which shall ever be the Prayer of,
Sir,
