BEing desirous (my honorable Lord) to exhibite some testimony of that ardent desire which I haue to doe your Lordship seruice, I am enfor∣ced to imitate that poore mā, which wanting better meanes to expresse his affction, offered his hands full of running water to Artaxrxes. For, knowing your Lordships loue to learning, (for Ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem) and hauing no inuention of mine owne, I haue boldly aduentured to draw water from another mans fountaine, and to commend this poore translation to your fauourable censure and honorable protection. Which I do the more humbly desire, for that I know your Lordships honorable name will be a sufficient bul∣warke against those snarling dogs, Quibus innatum est, vt non pro feritate, sed pro consuetudine latrent, which barke

more of custome then of curstnesse; which being guiltie to themselues of their owne imperfections, and hauing such muddie wits, that a man would sweare they were borne at Puddle wharfe, do notwithstanding labour to build their owne reputation vpon other mens disgraces; and by disgorging their malicious censures vppon the painful indeuors of all those which either diligētly write, or painfully translate, do thinke to purchase a lease of e∣ternall commendation. I will not blot my paper with any commendation of my Author, who was so noble for his birth, so famous for his learning, and so admirable for his inuention; lest I should seeme to hang out a bush where good wine is alreadie knowne to be sold, or to light a candle when the Sunne is in his vertical point. For if he proue any where distastful to your iudicious vnder∣standing, I must ascribe the fault to my selfe, which haue done him iniury, to cloath him with a sute so ill fitting to his proportion. But how meane soeuer it be, my humble request is, that your Lordship will accept it as a pledge of his dutifull loue, which is desirous to be euer at your Lordships commandement. And so humbly presuming to kisse your faire hands, I pray continually for the happie successe of all your honorable deseignements.
