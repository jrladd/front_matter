SIR,
MAY it please you to Pardon the Boldness of a Stranger to your Person, if upon the encouragement of Common Fame, he presumes so much upon your Can∣dor, as to lay before you this Account of his Travels. As the Scene of them is not only Remote, but for the most part little fre∣quented also, so there may be some things in them New even to you; and some, possibly, not altogether unuseful to the Publick. And that just Veneration which the World pays, as to your Genera! Worth, so especially to that Zeal for the advancement of Knowledge, and the Interest of your Country, which you express upon all Occasions, give you a particular Right to whatever may any way tend to the promoting these Interests, as an Offering due to your Merit. I have not so much of the vanity of a Traveller, as to be fond of telling stories, especially of this

kind; nor can I think this plain piece of mine, deserves a place among your more Curious Collections: much less have I the Arrogance to use your Name by way of Pa∣tronage for the too obvious faults, both of the Author and the Work. Yet dare I avow, according to my narrow sphere and poor abilities, a hearty Zeal for the promo∣ting of useful knowledge, and of any thing that may never so remotely tend to my Countries advantage: And I must own an Ambition of transmitting to the Publick through your hands, these Essays I have made toward those great ends, of which you are so deservedly esteemed the Patron. This hath been my design in this Publica∣tion, being desirous to bring in my Glean∣ings here and there in Remote Regions, to that general Magazine, of the knowledge of Foreign Parts, whieh the Royal Society thought you most worthy the Custody of, when they chose you for their President: and if in perusing these Papers, your Goodness shall so far distinguish the Experience of the Author from his Faults, as to judge him capable of serving his Country, either im∣mediately, or by serving you, he will en∣deavour by some real proofs to shew him∣self,
SIR,
