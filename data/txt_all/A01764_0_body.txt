TO THE RIGHT WORSHIP FVL SIR EDWARD Dimmock, Champion to her Maiestie, SAMVEL DANIEL wishèth happie health with increase of Worship.
He vnskilfull Statua∣rie wanting the twoo principall instruments of his science, iudge∣ment, and art: hauing rudely fashioned the forme of either some Apollo or Cupid, & waighing therewithal, the basenes of his simple worke: by good aduise e∣recteth the same on the sommitie of some high Pil∣ler, to the end that both the errors therein commit∣ted, may escape the narrow vewe of the captious, & likewise shadow all imperfections which might dis∣like the curious, both which he auoydeth by the di∣stance of his loftie mounted statue, escaping there∣by the staine of reproofe. In like maner right wor∣shipfull, haue I aduētured to place these my vnpoli∣shed labors on the Piller of your worthines, crauing the supportance of your fauorable protection. Whose

worthy name and Martial title being enstamped in their forehead, shal adorne them with a sufficiēt or∣namēt to passe the vewe without reprehension. And if herein I shall any way satisfie the delight of the studious Gentlemen, you alone are to receiue the guerdon of their fauorable voyces, whose offered courtesie hath enforced me to vndertake the tillage of so hard a soyle, to make you a present of the first fruites thereof: which if they are not such as your vertues deserue or my affection desires, yet spring they from the ground of a willing minde. Solon or∣dayned that the Sacrifices offered to the Goddes, should bee of as little cost as might bee, to the ende that great expences might not hinder religion, say∣ing: the Goddes did onely accept the willing heart respecting the pietie of the giuer, without waighing the largenesse of the gift. And I hope my small Sa∣crifice, proceeding from deuotion, shall be ac∣cepted on the Aulter of your courtesie. To whom he wisheth all happie felicitie, who remayneth al∣waies yours at com∣maunde.
