NOt long sythens, right hono∣rable, and my especiall good Lord, there was deliuered to mee A collection of the kinges prerogatiue, whiche Maister Staunforde had gathered and dedicated vnto your honour: which woorke by∣cause it is thought well of by the Sages of the lawe, and well worthy to be printed, I am there∣fore the bolder to put it in print, and publishe the same. And although the saide Maister Staun∣forde verie shortlye after that hee hadd dedi∣cated the same booke vnto your Lordship, were for his wisedome, grauitie, learning, integritie, & syncere dealinge, aduaunced to be a Iudge in the chiefe Court of this Realme for common plees, and for his good seruice therein was by iust de∣sert made knight, and albeit that your Lordship also sythens that tyme haue achieued the place,
 title and degree of high honour by the iudgemēt & calling of the Queenes most excellent maiesty: Yet I haue printed the Epistle dedicatorie of the said woork, in the same termes that the Authour thereof vsed, and with the same stile that your honour, and he both then had, when he dedicated the said woorke vnto your Lordship, as a Monu∣ment and token of the mutuall & long continued amitie betwene you: moste humbly praieng your Lordship to accept in good parte, accordinge to your accustomed goodnes, this my boldnes with your honour, and to pardon the same.
This 20. day of Nouember.
