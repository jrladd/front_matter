My Lord,
I Have been your debter these ma∣ny years, and although I was perswaded for∣merly to appear in print in a short Exposition upon the Book of Common-Prayer, yet that small and imperfect piece did seek pro∣tection

from the wings of another. It is my happiness now to make choice of a Subject most proper and fit for your Lordships Pa∣tronage; wherein Christianity and the Fence about it, the Vine and the Hedge are so delineated, according to the Primitive Pat∣terns, that this present age, wherein we live, may blush and stand amazed to see how much short they are in the practise of that Religion which they profess, and be ashamed of themselves that they of the first Age should be Christians indeed, whilst too many of this are one∣ly Christians in Name. It hath been very well observed by

the Antient Fathers, and as much by these two as by any, Holy Polycarp, and Divine Ignatius (who fly to the sa∣cred wings of your Lordships protection to secure them from a second Martyrdom, which the unkind world may threaten them withall) That Religion consists more in practice than in speculation, and is rather an Occupation than a meer Pro∣fession. But I will detain your Lordship no longer from the reading of them in our plain English, whom you have so often conversed with in their own Language. Thus having discharged a small part of my





debt, which yet your Accep∣tance will double upon me, I remain your Lordships debter still, ever praying for your Lord∣ships health and happiness.
