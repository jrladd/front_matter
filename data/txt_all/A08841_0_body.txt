Knight, and late Lord Embassadour
At Constantinople, that Cittie so renown'd
Whose like on earth is scarcely to be found.
William Painter wisheth all increase of grace
In this life, and in heauen a Mansion place.


RIght worshipfull Sir, for many fauours show
To me, that neuer yet deserued One.
Some from your selfe: your brother many Moe
Your Sister, and their Children also.
And though I no way can requite the same,
If I forget them should, I were to blame;
For meere humanity all men incite,
Vnto their power all kindnesse to requite.
I haue of late some little labour tooke,
The English prouerbs to write in a booke;
Though , yet the best that I could doe,
And  Worship Dedicate it to:
Yet c thereby shall declare,
The loe hich I doe vnto learning beare:

And I haue hope as the old prouerbe spake,
That barking curs oft times great mastifs wake,
That this my booke some scholler may incite,
Ere it bee long some better for to write.
If this I shall by any see amended,
I shall bee pleased and no whit offended.
If you vouchsafe but pleased herewithall,
I double paid account my labour shall,
If I could but in a full measure show,
The loue and seruice which to you I owe,
Although it came by labour and much paine,
Or with some losse, I should account it gaine.
But as the prouerbe saith, Few words suffice,
When they are spoke to those men that be wise:
So I had rather too abruptly end,
Then with long protestations to offend.
I thus conclude, beseeching mighty Ioue,
Hourely to send you blessings from aboue.
Your Worships Orator, wholy deuoted,
Till death in sunder cut the vitall threea.
