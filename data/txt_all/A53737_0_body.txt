Christian Reader,
ALthough our Lord Jesus Christ
hath laid blessed and stable
foundations of Unity, Peace and
Agreement in judgement and
affection amongst all his Disci∣ples,
and given forth Com∣mand
for their attendance unto them, that
thereby they might glorifie him in the world,
and promote their own spiritual advantage:
yet also foreknowing what effect the crafts of
Satan in conjunction with the darkness and
lusts of men would produce; that no offence
might thence be taken against him, or any of
his wayes, he hath sorewarned all men by
his Spirit what Differences, Divisions, Schisms
and Heresies would ensue on the publication of



the Gospel; and arise even among them that
should profess subjection unto his Authority
and Law. And accordingly it speedily came
to pass; For what Solomon sayes that he dis∣covered
concerning the first Creation, namely
that God made man upright, but he sought out
many inventions, or immixed himself in end∣less
questions; the same fell out in the new
creation or erection of the Church of Christ.
The state of it was by him formed upright,
and all that belonged unto it, were of one
heart, and one soul. But this harmony and
perfection of beauty, in answer to his Will
and Institution lasted not long among them;
many who mixed themselves with those Pri∣mitive
converts, or succeeded them in their
profession quickly seeking out perverse inven∣tions.
Hence in the dayes of the Apostles
themselves there were not only schisms and
divisions made in sundry Churches of their
own planting, with disputes about Opini∣ons
and needless impositions by those of the
Circumcision who believed; but also opposi∣tion
was made unto the very fundamental
Doctrines of the Deity and Incarnation of
the Son of God, by the Spirit of Antichrist
then entring into the world, as is evident
from their Writings and Epistles. But yet
as all this while our Lord Jesus Christ accor∣ding
to his promise preserved the root of



Love and Vnity amongst them who sincerely
believed in him entire (as he doth still, and
will do to the end) by giving the one and
selfsame spirit to guide, sanctifie and unite
them all unto himself; so the care and Au∣thority
of the Apostles during their abode in
the flesh, so far prevailed, that notwithstand∣ing
some temporary impeachments of Love
and Union in or amongst the Churches; yet
no signal prejudice of any long continuance
befell them. For either the miscarriages
which they fell into, were quickly retrieved
by them, the truth infallibly cleared, and pro∣vision
made for Peace, Vnity and Moderation
in and about things of less concernment; or
else the evil, guilt and danger of them, re∣mained
only with and upon some particular
persons, the notoriety of whose wickedness
and folly cast them out by common consent
from the communion of all the Disciples of
Christ. But no sooner was that sacred Soci∣ety
 with their immedi∣ate
successors, as Egesippus speaks in Eusebius,
departed unto their rest with God, but that
the Church it self, which untill then was pre∣served
a pure and incorruppted Virgin, began
to be vexed with abiding contention, and
otherwise to degenerate from its primitive
original purity. From thence forward, espe∣cially
after the heat of bloody and fiery per∣secutions



began to abate, far the greatest
part of Ecclesiastical Records consists in relati∣ons
of the Divisions, Differences, Schisms and
Heresies that fell out amongst them who pro∣fessed
themselves the Disciples of Christ.
For those failings errors and mistakes which
were found in men of peaceable minds, the
Church indeed of those dayes extended her
Peace and Vnity, if Justin Martyr and others
may be believed, to such as the seeming war∣mer
zeal, and really colder charity of the suc∣ceeding
Ages could not bear withal. But yet
divisions and disputes were multiplyed into
such an excess, as that the Gentiles fetcht ad∣vantage
from them not only to reproach all
Christians withall, but to deterr others from
the proession of Christianity. So Celsus in
his third Book deals with them; for saith he,
.
At first when they were but a few,
they were of one mind, or agreed well enough:
But being increased, and the multitude of them
scattered abroad, they were presently divided
again and again; and every one would have his
own party or division, and as in a divided
multitude opposed and reproved one another; so



that they had no communion among themselves,
but only in name, which for shame they retain.
So doth he for his purpose, as is the manner
of men, invidiously exaggerate the differences
that were in those early times amongst Chri∣stians:
for he wrote about the dayes of
Trajan the Emperour: That others of them
took the same course, is testified by Clemens,
Stromat. lib. 7. Augustin. lib. de Ovib. c. 15.
and sundry others of the antient Writers of
the Church. But that no just offence as
to the truth, or any of the wayes of Christ
might hence be taken, we are as I said before,
forewarned of all these things by the Lord
himself, and his Apostles; as also of the use
and necessity of such events and issues:
Whence Origen cryes out 
, Most admirable unto me seems
the saying of Paul, There must be Heresies
amongst you, that those who are approved
may be manifest. Nor can any just exccepti∣on
be hence taken against the Gospel it self.
For it doth not belong unto the excellency
or ignity of any thing to free it self from
all opposition, but only to preserve it self
from being prevailed against, and to remain
victorious, as the sacred truths of Christ have
done, and will do unto the end. Not a few in∣deed
in these evil dayes wherein we live, the
ends of the world, and the difficulties with



which they are attended being come upon us,
persons ignorant of things past, and regard∣less
of things to come, in bondage to their
present lusts and pleasures, are ready to make
use of the pretence of divisions and differences
among Christians, to give up themselves unto
Atheism, and indulge to their pleasures like
the beasts that perish Let us eat and drink for
too morrow we shall dye: Quid aliud inscribi
poterat sepulchro bovis! But whatever they
pretend to the contrary, it may be easily
evinced, that it is their personal dislike of
that holy obedience which the Gospel requi∣reth,
not the differences that are about the
Doctrines of it, which alienates their minds
from the truth. They will not some of them
foregoe all Philosophical inquiries after the na∣ture
and causes of things here below, though
they know well enough that there was never
any agreement amongst the wisest and severest
that at any time have been engaged in that
disquisition, nor is it likely that ever there
will be so. And herein they can countenance
themselves with the difficulty, obscurity and
importance of the things inquired after. But
as for the high and heavenly mysteries of the
Gospel, the least whereof is infinitely of more
importance, then any thing that the utmost
reach and comprehension of humane wisdom
can attain unto, they may be neglected and



despised because there are contentions about
them.
Hic nigrae succus loliginis, haec est
Erugo mera.
The truth is, this is so far from any real
ground for any such conclusion, that it were ut∣terly
impossible that any man should believe
the truth of Christian Religion, if he had not
seen or might not be informed that such con∣tention
and differences had ensued in and about
it; for that they should do so, is plainly and
frequently foretold in those sacred oracles of
it, whereof if any one be found to fail, the
veracity and authority of the whole may just∣ly
be called into question; If therefore men
will have a religion so absolutely facile aud ea∣sie,
that without diligence, endeavour, pains
or enquiry, without laying out of their rational
abilities, or exercising the faculties of their souls
about it, without foregoing of their lusts and
pleasures, without care of mistakes and mis∣carriages,
they may be securely wrapt up in it,
as it were whither they will or no: I confess they
must seek for some other where they can find
it, Christianity will yield them no relief. God
hath not proposed an acquaintance with the
blessed concernments of his Glory, and of their
own eternal condition, unto the sons of men



on any such terms, as that they should not
need with all diligence to employ and exercise
their faculties of their souls in the investigation
of them, in the use of the means by him ap∣pointed
for that purpose, seeing this is the
chiefest end for which he hath made us those
souls: And as for them, who in sincerity
give up their minds and consciences unto his
Authority and guidance, he hath not left them
without an infallible drection for such a dis∣charge
of their own duty as is sufficient to
guide and lead them in the middest of all diffe∣rences,
divisions and oppositions unto rest with
himself; and the difficulties which are cast upon
any in their enquiring after truth, by the errour
and deviation of other men from it, are all
sufficiently recompenced unto them, by the
excellency and sweetness which they find in
the truth it self, when sought out with dili∣gence
according to the mind of Christ. And
one said not amiss of old, ,
I dare say he is the wisest Christian, who hath
most diligently conidered the various differences
that are in and about Christianity, as being built
in the knowledge of the truth upon the best
and most stable foundations. To this end hath
the Lord Jesus given us his holy word, a per∣fect
and sure Revelation of all that he would
have us to believe or do in the worship of God.



This he commands us diligently to attend un∣to,
to study, seach, and enquire after, that we
may know his mind and do it. It is true in their
enquiry into it, various apprehensions concern∣ing
the sense and meaning of sundry things
revealed therein have befallen some men in
all ages; and Origen gives this as one occasion
of the differences that were in those dayes a∣mongst
Christians, .
Lib. 3. Con. Cel. 1. When ma∣ny
were converted unto Christianity, some of them
variously understanding the holy Scripture which
they joyntly believed, it came to pass that heresie
ensued. For this was the whole rule of faith & u∣nity
in those dayes; the means for securing of
us in them imposed on us of late by the Roma∣nists,
was then not heard of, not thought of in
the world. But moreover to obviate all dan∣ger
that might in this matter ensue from the
manifold weakness of our minds in appre∣hending
spiritual things, the Lord Jesus
hath promised his holy spirit unto all them
that believe in him, and ask it of him, to
prevent their mistakes and miscarriages in the
study of his word, and to lead them into all that
truth, the knowledge whereof is necessary,
that they may believe in him unto the end,
and live unto him. And if they who dili∣gently
and conscientiously without prejudices,

corrupt ends or designs in obedience to the
command of Christ, shall enquire into the
Scriptures to receive from thence the whole ob∣ject
of their faith and rule of their obedience,
and who believing his promise shall pray for
his Spirit, and wait to receive him in and by
the means appointed for that end, may not
be, and are not thereby secured from all such
mistakes and errours as may disinterest them
in the promises of the Gospel, I know not how
we may be brought unto any certainty or assu∣rance
in the Truths of God, or the everlast∣ing
consolation of our own souls. Neither
indeed is the nature of man capable of any
further satisfaction in or about these things,
unless God should work continual miracles,
or give continually special revelations unto all
individuals, whch would utterly overthrow the
whole nature of that faith and obedience
which he requires at our hands. But once to
suppose that such persons through a defect of
the means appointed by Christ for the instru∣ction
and direction before mentioned may
everlastingly miscarry, is to cast an unspeaka∣ble
reproach on the goodness, grace and faith∣fulness
of God, and enough to discourage all
men from enquiring after the truth. And
these things the Reader will find further clear∣ed
in the ensuing discourse, with a discovery
of the weakness, falseness and insufficiency



of those rules and reliefs which are tendred
unto us by the Romanists in the lieu of them
that are given us by God himself. Now if this
be the condition of things in Christian Religi∣on
as to any one that hath with sincerity con∣sulted
the Scripture, or considered the Good∣ness,
Grace and Wisdom of God, it must
needs appear to be, it is manifest that mens
startling at it, or being offended upon the ac∣count
of divisions and differences among them
that make profession thereof, is nothing but
a pretence to cloke and hide their sloth and su∣pine
negligence, with their unwillingness to
come up unto the indispensable condition of
learning the truth as it is in Jesus, namely obe∣dience
unto his whole will, and all his commands
so far as he is pleased to reveal them unto us.
With others they are but incentives unto that
diligence, and watchfulness, which the things
themselves in their nature high and arduous, and
in their importance of everlasting moment, re∣quire
at your hands? Further on those who by
the means formentioned come to the know∣ledge
of the truth, it is incumbent according
as they are by Gods providence called there∣unto,
and as they receive ability from him for
that purpose, to contend earnestly for it. Nor
is their so doing any part of the evil that at∣tends
differences and divisions, but a means ap∣pointed
by God himself for their cure and



removal, provided as the Apostle speaks that
they strive or contend lawfully. The will of
God must be done in the wayes of his own
appointment. Outward force and violence,
corporal punishments, swords and faggots, as
to any use in things purely spiritual and religi∣ous,
to impose them on the consciences of men,
are condemned in the Scripture, by all the
antient or first writers of the Church, by sun∣dry
Edicts and Laws of the Empire, and are
contrary to the very light of Reason whereby
we are men, and all the principles of it from
whence mankind consenteth and coalesceth
into civil society. Explaining, declaring,
proving and confirming the truth, con∣vincing
of gainsayers by the evidence of com∣mon
principles on all hands assented unto, and
right reason, with prayer and supplications
for success, attended with a conversation be∣coming
the Gospel we profess, is the way
sanctified by God unto the promotion of the
truth, and the recovery of them that are
gone astray from it. Into this work according
as God hath imparted of his gifts and spirit
unto them, some in most ages of the Church
have been engaged; and therein have not
contracted any guilt of the evils of the con∣tentions
and divisions in their dayes, but cleared
themselves of them, and faithfully served the
interest of those in their generation. And this



justifies and warrants us in the pursuit of the
same work, by the same means, in the same days
wherein we live. And when at any time men
sleep in the neglect of their duty, the envious
one will not be wanting to sow his Tares in the
field of the Lord; which as in the times and
places wherein we live it should quicken the
diligence and industry of those upon whom the
care of the preservation of the truth is by the
providence of God in an especial manner de∣volved,
and who have manifold advantages for
their encouragement in their undertaking; so
also it gives countenance even to the meanest
endeavours that in sincerity are employed in
the same work by others in their more private
capacity, amongst which I hope the ensuing
brief discourse may with impartial Readers
find admittance. It is designed in general for
the defence and vindication of the truth, and that
truth which is publickly professed in this Na∣tion,
against the solicitation of it, and opposi∣tion
made unto it with more then ordinary
vigilancy, and seeming hopes of prevalency,
on what grounds I know not. This is done by
those of the Roman Church, who have given in
themselves as sad an instance of a degeneracy
from the truth, as ever the Christian world had
experience of, from insensible and almost
imperceptible entrances into deviations from
the holy rule of the Gospel, countenanced by



pecious pretences of piety and devotion, but
really influenced by the corrupt lusts of ambiti∣on,
love of preheminence, and earthly mind∣edness,
in men ignorant or neglective of the
 and simplicity of the Gospel, their Apo∣stcy
hath been carried on by various degrees
upon advantages given unto those that made
the benefit of it unto themselves, by political
commotions and alterations, until by sundry
artifices and sleights of Sathan and men, it is
grown unto that stated opposition to the right
wayes of God, which we behold it come un∣to
at this day: The great Roman Historian de∣sires
his Reader in the perusal of his discourses
to consider and observe, quae vita, qui mores fu∣erint,
per quos viros quibus{que} artibus domi mili∣tiae{que}
& partum & auctum imperium sit. La∣bente
einde paulatim disciplina velut dissiden∣s
primo mores sequatur animo; deinde at ma∣gis
magis{que} lapsi sint, tum ire caeperint praecipites,
donec ad haec tempora, quibus nec vitia nostra nec
remedia pati possumus, perventum est; What was
the course of life, what were the manners of
thse men both at home and abroad, by whom the
Roman Empire was rected and enlarged; as al∣so
how antient discipline insensibly decaying, far
different manners ensued, whose decay more and
 increasing, at length they began violently
to decline untill we came unto these dayes wherein
we are able to beare neither our vices nor their



remedies: All which may be as truly and justly
spoken of the present Roman Ecclesiastical
estate. The first Rulers and members of that
Church by their exemplary sanctity and suf∣fering
for the truth, deservedly obtained great
renown & reputation amongst the other Chur∣ches
in the world; but after a while the disci∣pline
of Christ decaying amongst them, and the
purity of his doctrine beginning to be corru∣pted,
they insensibly fell from their pristine
glory, untill at length they precipitantly tum∣bled
into that condition; wherein because
they fear the spiritual remedy would be their
temporal ruine, they are resolved to abide, be
it never so desperate or deplorable. And
hence also it is, that of all the opposition that
ever the disciples of Christ had to contend
withall, to suffer under, or to witness against,
that made unto the truth by the Roman
Church, hath proved the longest, and been
attended with the most dreadful consequents.
For it is not the work of any one Age, or of a
few persons to unravel that web of falshood
and unrighteousness, which in a long tract of
time hath been cunningly woven, and closely
compacted together. Besides the Heads of
this declension have provided for their secu∣rity
by intermixing their concerns with the
Polity of many Nations, and moulding the con∣stitutions
of their Governments unto a subser∣viency



to their interests and ends. But he is
strong and faithful who in his own way and
time will rescue his Truth and Worship from
being trampled on and defiled by them. In
the mean time that which renders the errors
of the Fathers and Sons of that Church
most penitious unto the professors of
Christianity, is, that whether out of blind
zeal, rooted in that obstinacy which men are
usually given up unto who have refused to retain
the Truth in the love and power of it, or
from their being necessitated thereunto in
their Councils for the supportment and preser∣vation
of their present interests and secular
advantages, they are not contented to em∣brace,
practice and adhere unto those crooked
paths that they have chosen to walk in, and
to attempt the drawing of others into them
by such wayes and means as the light of Na∣ture,
right reason, with the Scripture, directs
to be used in and about the things of Religion
which relate to the minds and souls of men,
but also they have pursued an imposition of
their conceptions and practises on other men
by force and violence, untill the world in ma∣ny
places hath been made a stage of oppression,
rapine, cruelty and war, and that which they call
their Church, a very Shambles of the slaughter'd
Disciples of Christ. So that what the Histo∣rin
said of the old Rmns in reference unto



the Galls or, Cimbrians; us{que} ad nostram memo∣riam,
Roman alla omni virtuti suae prone esse;
cum Gall is pro salute non proglorta certari; we
may apply unto them; it is not Truth only,
but our Temporal safety also that we are en∣forced
to contend with them about. And
whom they cannot reach with outward vio∣lence,
they endeavour to lade with curses, and
by precipitate censures and determination to
eject them out of the limits of Christiani∣ty,
as to the spiritual and eternal priviledges
wherewith it is attended. And these things
make all hopes of Reconciliation for the future,
and of present moderation languid and weak, as
all endeavours after them hither to have been
fruitless. For whilest they contend that every
proposall of their Church, every way, and
mode, in the worship of God that is in usage
amongst them, is not only true, and right,
but of necessity to be embraced and submitted
unto; and therefore impose them by all sorts
of penalties on the consciences and practises of
all men, is it not eviden that there can be no
peace nor agreement in the world but what
waste and solitude arising from an extermina∣tion
of persons otherwise minded then them∣selves,
will produce? some o them I confess
to serve their present supposed advantages, have
of late declmed about moderation in matters
of Religion; and I wish that herein that may



be sincerely indeavoured by some, which for
sinister ends, is corruptly pretended by others.
For mine own part, there are no sort of men
from whose frame of spirit and waies I shall
labour a greater distance then theirs, who
set themselves against that moderation towards
persons differing from them and others in the
result of their thoughts upon an humble sin∣cere
investigation of the truth and wayes of
Christ, which himself and his Apostles com∣mend
unto us, or that refuse to consent unto
any way of Reconciliation of dissenters, where∣in
violence is not offered unto the commands
of God, as stated in their consciences. Let
the Romanists renounce their principles about
the absolute necessity of the subjection of all
persons unto the Pope, in answer unto that
groundless and boundless Authority which in
things sacred and civil they assign unto him,
with their resolution of imposing the dictates
of their Church per fas & nefas upon our con∣sciences,
and we shall endeavour with all qui∣etness
and moderation to plead with them about
our remaining differences, and to joyn with
them in the profession of those important
truths wherein we are agreed. But whilest
they propose no other forms of Reconciliation,
but our absolute submission unto their Papal
Authority, with our assent unto, and professi∣on
of those doctrines which we are perswaded



are contrary to the Scripture, with the sense of
Catholick Antiquity, derogatory to the Glory
of God, and prejudicial to the salvation of those
by whom they are received, and our concur∣rence
with them in those wayes of Religious wor∣ship,
which themselves are fallen into by de∣grees
they know not how, & which we believe
dishonourable unto God, and pernitious to the
souls of men, I see no ground of any other peace
with them, but that only which we are bound to
follow with all men, in abstaining from mutual
violences, performing all offices of Christian
love, and in a special praying for their repen∣tance
and coming to the acknowledgment of the
Truth. On this account was it, that some
while since upon the desire of some friends,
I undertook the examination of a discourse
entituled Fiat Lux, whose Author under a
pretence of that moderation, which is indeed
altogether inconsistent with other principles
of his profession, endeavoured to insinuate
a necessity of the reception of Popery for the
bringing of us to peace or agreement here,
and the interesting of us in any hope of eter∣nal
rest and peace hereafter. Whether that
small labour were seasonable or no, or whe∣ther
any service were done therein to the in∣terest
of Truth, is left to the judgement of men
unprejudiced. Not long after there was pub∣lished
an Epistle, pretending a Reply unto that



discourse, being indeed a meer flourish of em∣pty
words, and a giving up of the cause where∣in
the Author of Fiat Lux was engaged, as
desperate and indefensible. However I thought
it not meet to let it pass without some consi∣deration;
partly that the design of that Trea∣tise,
with others of the like nature of late
published amongst us, might be further mani∣fested,
and partly that the ends of moderation
and peace being fixed between us, I might
farther try and examine, whose, and what prin∣ciples
are best suited unto their pursuit and
accomplishment. I have not therefore con∣fined
my self unto an Answer unto the Epistle
of the Author of Fiat Lux, which indeed it
doth not deserve, as I suppose, himself being
judge; but have only from it taken occasion
to discuss those principles and usages in Reli∣gion,
wherein the most important differences
between Papists and Protestants do▪lie. For
whereas the whole difference between them and
us, is branched into two general heads; the
first concerning those principles which they
and we severally build our profession upon,
and resolve our faith into; and the other re∣specting
particular instances in doctrines of
faith, and practice in Religious worship, I
have laid hold of occasion to treat of them
both; of the former absolutely, and of the lat∣ter
in things of most weight and concernment▪



And because the Judgement of Antiquity is
deservedly of moment in these things, I have
not only manifested it to lie plain and clear
against the Romanist in instances sufficient to
impeach their pretended infallibility; which is
enough to dissolve that whole imaginary fa∣brick
that is built upon it, and centers in it;
but also in most of the material controversies
that are between them and us. These things
Christian Reader, I thought meet to premise
towards the prevention of that offence which
any may really take, or for corrupt ends pre∣tend
so to do, at the differences in general that
are amongst Christians, or those in especial
which are between us and the Roman Church;
as also to give an account of the occasion,
design and end of the ensuing consideration of
them.
