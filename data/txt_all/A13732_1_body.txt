BEing willing (Right Ho∣nourable, and my verie good Lord) in the sight of all the World to leaue some publike testimonie of my humble dty, and vfi∣ned
 good will towards your Honour, I thought I could no better way performe it, then by dedicating these poore labours of mine, to bee shrowded and harboured vn∣der your Honours fauoura∣ble protection; beseeching your Honour to accept this my humble and bounden du∣tie. And as I dedicate it to your Honour, so I humbly craue that it may bee defen∣ded: for GOD hath set you in authoritie to maintaine his Word, and loue his Reli∣gion, which hee hath prescri∣bed in his holy Gospell. Hee hath honoured you, that you should honour him; and hath set you up, that you should
 maintaine him, and wholly trust in him, and lie to him, as a say that can neuer faile, neither in this World, nor t the World to come. All o∣ther things shall faile (for all flesh is grasse, and the glo∣ry of man is as the flower of the field) but GOD is euerlasting, his Word is euer∣lasting, and they that are be∣gotten to him by the ir∣tall seede of his Word, shall liue for euer: and this life be∣ginneth, and groweth, and increaseth in the true know∣ledge of GOD, to the increa∣sing of our faith, and ∣king in vs as the seale of our adoption that true sanctifi∣cation, that maketh vs to liue
 vnto GOD by righteous∣nesse, purely to worship hi ccording to his Word, an with brotherly loue deuoi of all ypocisie, from a pur heart to oue our Neighbour This (Honourable Lord) i true Religion, whereunto  GOD in great mercy hat called you, so g cheerefull forward. Beware of thi vaine World, and of tha ine trust that wiched m are wt to put in it; lean t vpon it, but stoppe you eares against the eeanting and fawning whispering of the hollowesse thereof and the dissolute Professors for there can bee  grea∣ter trespasse against the L
 theto  vpon Assyria, to rest in the strength of Egypt, to goe downe into Ethopia: Cursed is that Man that putteth his trust in Man, and maketh flesh his e; hee shall be like the Heath that groweth in the Wildernesse: But con∣, He that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall mbrace him on euerie side, he shall neuer be con∣founded, hee shall bee s Mount , and shall ne∣uer be remoed, for the Lord is his secret place, & is with him, therefore who can  against him? What is a ns owe, what are his legges, what is the
 swiftnesse of Horses,  the strength of an Hoa or the fauour of all th Princes of the World i comparison of God, i whom is onely the assu∣rance of that euerlastin inheritance? It is the Go of Iacob that must be ou defence, our strong Tow∣er and Rock; the Chari and Horsemen of Israe the testimony of his pr∣sence and fauour, th onely can make vs glad Wherefore againe, and ∣gaine, I most humbly be∣seech your Honour, bewa of vaine trust and consden in Men, and in things th are lesse worth then M
 nd as GOD hath in mercy estowed vpon your Honour reat wisedome, so pray that ou may haue a discerning pirit, that the deceiuable lory of this World make you ot forget your greatest duty, hat so you may shine in his erlasting Kingdome.
True Religion (Honou∣able Lord) is effected by at diuine and eternall wis∣ome, whereby the contem∣atiue vertue of man is lif∣d vp to the happy know∣dge of the Maiesty of God, all other the greatest ver∣e; and wherein resteth the iefest contentment in this . For if there be a Pare∣e in this life, it is seated in
 one of these two, either in Re∣ligious Meditations, or i holy studies and godly spec∣lation: because whatsoeu is not in one of these two,  full of griefe, vexation, bi∣ternesse, fearefulnesse, ca and sorrow. But as Christi moesty (Right Honourabl hath moued me to giue to e∣rie thing his due, in not ce∣sing from setting forth a thing in the praise of th which of right deserueth  be commended: so Christi Iustice and equity would  suffer mee to let that pa without some commenda∣on, whereunto I am not ab sufficiently to giue any. B considering that slightly
 commend a thing, were the next way to dispraise it, ex∣ept withall it were shrw∣ded under the Patronage of ome worthy Person; and hinking it vnmeete to let hat go like an Orphan with∣ut a father at home: I haue resumed to commit it vnto our Honours protection: not bare Lawrell, which of it lfe for the greennesse (when ther be withered) may seem  bee accepted, but the same ecked and adorned with ost heauenly Meditations.  that (as I thinke) if your onour were presented with materiall Lawrell, wherein esides naturall greennesse) ere but this necery vse,
 that it could defend you i your Garden from the heat of the Sunne, you would ac∣cept, if not of the gift, yet o the good will of the giuer.
So relying my selfe still vp∣pon your Honours wonte accustomed fauour and cle∣mency, I doubt not but yo will affoord mee a fauoura∣ble and friendly acceptatio hereof. For herein is not th greennes which consisting  naturall qualities must the wither, when all things ha their ending according t their nature: but the flourish∣ing greene promises of th coenant of God, which ( God himselfe) last alwaie immutable and vnchangea∣ble.
 Here are not the beauti∣full leaues of a materiall tree, which delight onely the out∣ward sight, but a most fami∣liar view and patterne of God himselfe in Christ, euen to the delight of the soule, and inward comfort of the spirit, which take pleasure onely in Heauenly things.
To conclude, here you are not shrowded from the heate of the Sunne, but shall finde most coole shade from the parching heate of sinne: from which, (as in duety I am bound) I will pray, that God in this life shield and defend you, and in the life to come grant you eurlasting rest.
Thus presuming on your
 Honors wonted fauours and curtesies shewed vnto mee, and crauing pardon for this my bold enterprise, I hum∣bly take my leaue.
