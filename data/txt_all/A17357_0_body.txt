Great CHARLES

I Doe not thinke the Verse I write,
VVorthy the honour of your Princely fight;
(And should you read no lines, but worth your view,
Men knew not what to dedicate to you)


But hauing nothing els to shew my zeale,
VVith VViddow, what I haue, I freelie deale: Marc. 12▪
To giue rich Donatiues great Princes vse,
T'is also greatnesse badge not to refuse
Smal presents; els how should meane persons showe
That duty, which to Potentates they owe?


To you my PRINCE I consecrate my booke,
Reward my Muse: with what? your gratious looke.


Vouchsafe to read our Poëm, vvherein all
Is written without malice, without gall:
VVee are not bitter at the Present time,
Onelie wee saie Rebellion is a Crime.
Aud auntient sectaries our verse doth strike,
VVho so shall doe your Highnesse needs must like.


And though wee speake in rime, as Poets vse,
Yet sacred veritie attends our Muse.
Truth on our Poëm waits: (an vpright cause,
To set it fourth needeth no lying clause:)
In all our building there is not a stone,
But wee dare justifie to be our owne.
Certes now wee haue perfited our frame,
Casting reflections eie vpon the same
VVe doubt much vvhether vvee haue anie vaine
In Poetrie, because wee doe not faine.
Vouchsafe then Mighty CHARLES my Booke to view
VVhich is all Innocent, all smooth, all true.
