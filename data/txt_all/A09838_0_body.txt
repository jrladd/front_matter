SIR, I would think it an vn∣worthie thing to presente your Highnesse with such a meane Pamphlet as this; ta∣ken out of my  Ser mones; vnlesse the argument thereof craued a powerfull Protector and pa∣trone. For besides, it speaketh the truth ∣ly, without coloured Rethoricke of wordes, the matter therein entreated, is odious in the eyes & eares of many, who find themselues tuitched as guilty of Sacrilege. Herefore I could seke no other retreate, but vnder your highnes wings: who (besides ye would gladly heare the trueth simply spoken) haue also your parte in this turne. For your Highnesse is no lesse interest then the Kirk, in the wrongfull abusing of the Kirk-rents. And as to me, the Lord know∣eth how far it is from my heart, to procure wil∣lingly the hatred of any person, great or smal. Yet in respect of the charge I beare; and that it

is very vncomely for my gray-haires (my one foote being alreadie in the graue) to play the hypocrite or flatterers parte: But to discharge a good conscience in this and all other behalfes belonging vnto my calling: Herefore reposing vppon your Maiesties good minde and coun∣tenance against all calumniators of mee, for this my plaine dealing; and humbly submit∣ting this and all other my laboures, to your hie∣nesse censure and correction, in any thing I shalbe found to haue failed or spoken amisse, I humbly take my leaue: Beseeching the Lorde of Heauen to further and aduance all your Hie∣nesse good and godly intentions, to therefor∣mation of all abuses within your Land.
