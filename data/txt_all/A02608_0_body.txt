Most Renowned, most Dread, and most Gracious Soueraigne,
IT is not long since I heard a Recusant of vnderstan∣ding and qualitie professe, that the Spiritual presence of our Sauiour Iesus Christ in the holy Sacrament of the Lords Sup∣per, contented him sufficiently. But he de∣sired satisfaction, at the same time, in the matter of Supremacie, and to haue rea∣sons why Christian Princes should chal∣lenge it. I promised to resolue him in that point too; and had not any thing so readie to do it withall, as certain collections which I gathered for a Sermon preached before your most Excellent Matie. Those I haue

now published, that all of my charge may take cōmoditie to reade them for their sa∣tisfaction or vse. And that they are like to do with more cheerefulnesse, if your Matie wil be Gratiously pleased to let them passe vnder your Royall protection, with the same Clemency now which you vouchsa∣fed to countenāce them withall, when they were pronounced in your Sacred presence. The Lord that hath giuē your Matie both this great power, to be his Lieutenāt, & a prudent heart to exercise it, continue your happy Gouernement, to the aduancemēt of his glory, the comfort of these Churches, and your owne Eternall honour. Euen so prostrating my selfe to kisse your blessed hands, I remaine
