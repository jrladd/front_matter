Reverend and worthy Sir,
YOur late Approbation of my good and zealous design herein (however meanly manag'd by so young, help∣less, and unqualify'd an Author) emboldens me to this Publication under your Name; which has so well merited of the Christian Church; That I cannot but find Protection hereby, from the Insolencies and Affronts of Scorn and Prejudice; and from all the open Injuries of un∣just Censure, and uncharitableness: Though Pride, World∣liness, and Hypocrisie, may still prove irrefragable, and constantly undermine the Plain-dealer: Yet alass! this Grievance is nothing to that common Infidelity, Prophane∣ness, and Irreligion uncontroulably revelling in this confused Age; and impudently confronting every thing Just, and sacred; doing all possible despight to God, and his Church. This intolerable madness, with those many-headed Mon∣sters, every where rending Christs seamless Coat, cry a∣loud for speedy suppression; or woful vengeance upon a stupid People; which latter nothing surely can now pre∣vent, but either an Universal Reformation, and unanimous Piety; or a due execution of Primitive Discipline, which the Gospel authorises; which our more Zealous and Godly Forefathers exercised under the hottest Persecutions; which the Greek Church has all along maintain'd under Turkish Bondage; and which alass! our holy Establish'd Church could not thus long have only wish'd, and annually hop'd for in vain; were not here more fatal and general Corruptions, and
more daring Impiety, than any where else; as consequent∣ly more dreadful will be our Desolation, which nothing certainly, but Gods infinite mercy, through the merits of our gracious Redeemer, hearkening to the Prayers and Tears of some faithful Sons of Abraham amongst us, hath hitherto delayed.
Now therefore since only gentle perswasion remains; since we are to preach in Season, and of Season, to Rebuke and Exhort, and not wilfully to neglect any means of informing our selves, or instructing others: And since we must be careful of mistakes, and resolvedly honest, not to concel any part of our Duty from our Flocks: And since it is high time for the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord, to weep between the Porch and the Altar; and to say, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thine Heritage to re∣proach. Who can blame me for, or how can I excuse my self from such poor endeavours, as my double charge and circumstances can allow, which otherwise perhaps might produce something more correct, and elaborate, and thus far more useful, &c.
However give me leave, Sir, thus to attend you as my Gamaliel; and in an humble (tho faint) imitation, and even in as great a distance as your noble endowments, and ex∣cellent Abilities have set me; thus to presume upon ad∣miration of your Zeal and vigilance, your Piety and goodness, your publick Spirited Charity and Justice, your profound Judgment and Prudence, and your constant meekness and affability, so well know to the World, in your many Beneficial Writings and Conversation at home and abroad. This without Compliment or flattery (which can't be here, and which has always been far from my Tem∣per) I shall only mention, and thus beg your favourable accep∣tance hereof, in Testimony of those many condescending favours bestow'd upon your unworthy,

Orpington, Jan. 23. 1692.
