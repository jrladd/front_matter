I Know my selfe and mine owne vnwor∣thinesse too well, to be so far in loue with a∣ny thing of mine own, as to thinke it worthy publicke view. That which once Augustine spake of himselfe in humility, I must say
 of my selfe in truth: Serm. de Di¦uersis. 32. Quis sum e∣go? Homo sum vnus de multis, non de magnis. And I know the truth of Saluians obseruation. Contra. Auarit. lib. 1. Om∣nia dicta tanti existimantur quan∣tus est ipse qui dixit, et qui legunt non tam considerant quid legant quam cuius legant, nec tam di∣ctionis vim atque virtutem quam dictatoris cogitant dignitatem. So that vpon these grounds I had great reason to haue for-borne the Publi∣shing of this Sermon. Yet agayne, some reasons there were that were preualent with me, to put it forth. First, that I might a little inlarge some things that streights of time would not in the deliuery, permit to be medled withall. Secondly, it was my desire to leaue a Monument,
 and to giue a publicke testimony of my thankefulnes to the Honourable House, for your so faire acceptance, and recompence of so weake, and vn∣worthy a Seruice, as was done you in this Sermon. Lastly, endeauours in this kinde haue a blessing from God, and want not their successe: I easily fore-see to how many censures I ex∣pose my selfe by this course, but I haue set vp my rest with him. Saluian. contr. Auarit. lib. 4.  Suffi∣ciunt nobis in hac parte sancto∣rum sensus et Iudicia, quibus idem sentientibus at{que} nos certi profecto sumus Deum ipsum sentire nobis∣cum: Pravorum hominum sensus aut parvi aestimandi sunt, aut nihil omnino faciendi. If I find acceptance with those that be good, and hereby may doe any good, I haue enough.
 The God of Heauen guide and blesse you in all your weighty deli∣berations, and make you an happy healing Parliament, to make vp all the breaches of the Land.
