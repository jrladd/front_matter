GReater thy Selfe,Autor vvebat ista ante auspi∣catiss▪ nuptias. by greatest Princes sought,
On whom best Starres haue smilde their influence,
Where heau'n a Map of Miracles hath wrought,
Our glory, Natures pride, Earths excellence:
In whom alone the Graces liue refinde,
Where Chastitie with more then Cyprian-feature,
And Beautie with all vertue liues conioyn'd:
O Goddesse sure! or some Celestiall Creature!
In whose whose faire face so equally doe runne
The purest Lillie-white, the Orientst red,
Like Vialactea, and the Rising Sunne.
Happy that Prince shall the faire Princesse wed,
Which holy Hymen shall no snoner finish,
But we shall pray. That thou the blessedst Bride
Mai'st with such blessed ones the World replenish,
That may hereafter help the world to guide.
And that our Royall blood more deepe root take,
As they from thee, so may from them spring other:
May thy great Father, great Grand-father wake,
And reckon their descent from thy blest Mother:
And Englands King, and Queene, may liue to see,
Their Childrens Children, Kings and Queenes to bee.
Maneant afata nepotes.
