REVEREND SIR,
I Have read over the Books you were pleased to lend me, (viz.) Dr. Burnet's Theory of the Earth, and Dr. Wood∣ward's Essay toward a Natural Hi∣story of it: Both which entertain'd me with a great many new and ve∣ry notable Hypotheses, managed with a great deal of Art, Ingenui∣ty and Learning; but in my Opi∣nion very ill grounded; many of their Notions being inconsistent with common Sense and Experi∣ence, with Scripture and Reason;

especially the Mosaick Account of the Creation, Paradise, and the Universal Deluge; and in some Particulars, Dr. Woodward seems inconsistent with himself.
These following Chapters, (which I make bold to present to your Hand, and to give you the Trouble of perusing) will shew you wherein I cannot concur with these great Virtuoso's, and why I endeavour to establish a quite dif∣ferent Notion of things; and do ground it upon such Philosophical Theses, as Moses, that great Philo∣sopher, has laid down as so many Postulata in his short, but most comprehensive System of the Cre∣ation; the whole being a short and compendious Description of this World of Matter, and this World of Life wherein we live.
SIR; I am so far from being big with a fond Concei of any of these Notions, that I dare not trust them in any Hands but yours; for I am unwilling that these Pa∣pers (without your Approbation and Encouragement,) should go further abroad than your Study, lest some ill-natur'd and peevish Critick should take occasion to ex∣pose the Ignorance and Disingenui∣ty of their Author.
I know (Sir) that the Experi∣ence you have lately gain'd by searching into those occult Regi∣ons of Matter, being now added to your former Speculations about it; has made you the most capa∣ble of determining all Differences, and solving the most difficult Phae∣nomena of this Kind. If you will be pleas'd therefore to correct with your Pen the Mistakes you meet

with in any of these Notions, and let me have your honest and im∣partial Opinion of them, you will further oblige,
Sir,
