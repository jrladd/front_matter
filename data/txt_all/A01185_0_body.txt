Madam,
AMong many the
worthie Chancellors
of this famous Isle,
there is obserued in
Sir THOMAS MORE, and Sir
FRANCIS BACON an admirable
sympathy of wit and humour:
witnesse those graue monu∣ments
of inuention & learning,
wherewith the world is so
plentifully enricht by them
both. I will instance onely in

the conceaued Vtopia of the
one, and the reuealed Sapientia
Veterum of the other: Whereof
the first (vnder a meere Idea of
perfect State gouerment) con∣taines
an exact discouerie of the
vanities and disorders of reall
Countries: And the second (out
of the foulds of Poeticall fables)
laies open those deepe Philoso∣phicall
mysteries, which had
beene so long lockt vp in the
Casket of Antiquity; so that it
is hard to iudge to whether of
these two worthies, Policy and
Morality is more behoulding.
I make no question therefore
but this obseruation (touching
the parallel of their spirits) shal
passe so currant to succeeding
ages, that it will be said of thē as
in former times pronounced of
Xenophon & Plato, Fuere aequales.

And for this Booke that
humbly present to your High∣nes,
which so eminently ex¦presseth
its owne perfection, in
me it would seeme no lesse a va∣nity
to giue it attributes of
glory and praise, then if I should
lend Spectacles to Lynx, or an
Eye to Argus, knowing it
needles to wast guilding on
pure Gould, which is euer best
valued by its owne true touch
& luster. But to descend to my
selfe, that doe now lay before
your Princely cēsure the Trans∣lation
of these excellent and iu∣dicious
discourses, so barely
wrapt vp in my harsh English
phrase, that were by the Author
so richly attired in a sweet La∣tine
stile: I must therein flie to
the Sanctuary of your gracious
acceptance. In which hope se∣curing

my doubts, doe with
all reuerence kisse your Prin∣cely
hands: Remaining
euer readie to ap∣proue
my
selfe
