My first Love,
LOve is strong. That providence which brought me amongst you makes me love you; that love, time and absence have not obliterated; but still like the Laurel it retains its green∣ness.
I served a full apprentiship with you in the Ministry of the Gospel, wherein my design and desire was the conversion of your souls. These papers I send after my former pains with you, to second what I then taught you. The Spirit as principal bless both the one and the other to you. I called you often in the name of Christ to come to Christ, and I hope it was not wholly without effect on some. My love constrains me to call again in this ensuing Treatise, which while you are reading, I hope I shall be praying that God would prosper it to you.

 Be convinced of the danger of a na∣tural condition. I have often touched on this string; if it have jarred to you, I wish the Lord would so temper your spirits, that now it may be melodious. I pray that he that succenturiates, and is come in my room, may reap the harvest of my seed-time; and if what was sown and came up then but thin, may grow up now to full ears of corn; it shall through grace be a cordial to my spirit: Love and cherish that light which burns among you. Take heed of the infection of error. Be diligent hearers, and not only so, but also dutiful practicers of the Word.
The Lord prevail with you, and effe∣ctually call you unto himself; that pre∣destination from eternity may be mani∣fested by your timely acceptance of Christ. This is and shall be the prayer of

From my house in Hevenin∣gham, Feb. 4. 1657/8.
