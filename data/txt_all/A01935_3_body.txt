RIGHT WORSHIP.
WHen J consider the manifold fa∣vours and courtesies that J have found at your hands, J am ready to say unto my selfe, as Ruth said once to Boaz, Ruth 2. 10. Qua∣re inveni gratiam? Why have J found grace in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing J am a stranger? For mine owne part J can impute it to nothing, but unto Gods goodnesse, and your owne worthinesse: And my onely ambition is to make you this acknowledge∣ment

 the world may for, though J  pre,  N  Ioa ist to David  Sam. 24▪ 3. so wish J to you, The  God  t your tate, how much soever it be, an hundred fold, and that your eyes may see it, and your heart may rejoyce in it all the dayes of your life.
