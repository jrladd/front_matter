MY LORD,
IT was the saying of a lear∣ned,
wise, and great Man, of
our Nation, that Books of
Use ought to have no
Patron, but Truth and
Reason; And whether or no I have obser∣ved
this Rule, in devoting this Book to
your Lordship's Patronage, will not be
much disputed by Any, who have the Hap∣pinesse

and Honour to Know you well. For,
whoever understands your general insight
into all Kinds of Learning, your exact
Iudgment in distinguishing Truths from
Falshoods, however subtily concealed and
plausibly delivered, and your strict Reaso∣nings
in all Arguments offered to your Con∣sideration,
doth need no other proofs to con∣vince
him, that, if You are not Truth and
Reason it selfe Animated, yet (at least)
you have them in you, in so eminent a de∣gree,
that it can be no Flattery to say, You
are therein a Grand Exemplar to Others:
nor will the most Scrupulous refuse to em∣brace,
as Authentique and Current, what∣ever
Position hath once received the stamp
of your Assent and Approbation. So
singular a Felicity it is, to render Nobility
more illustrious with Learning; to have
long cultivated a fertil Mind, with select
Precepts, and usefull Observation of
Men and Manners; and alwayes to make
mature Deliberation the Harbinger to
Belief, as well as to Action.
Besides, the Argument of this Dis∣course,

which now humbly seeks your Lps.
Countenance, is much more proper and
fit for Your Cognizance, than vulgar
Eyes perhaps may judge, when they
first glance upon the Title of it. For (to
omit, that it leads to the most excellent of
all Human Knowledges; the Knowledge
of Ones self, which is the ground-work of
Civil Prudence) it explaineth the most
probable Oeconomy of Nature in per∣fect
Animals; and especially the most per∣fect
and noble of them, Man: A piece of
Science, certainly, so far from being Unne∣cessary
to a States-man, that I dare affirme,
None can ever attain to any compe∣tent
proficiency in the Mysteries of
State-principles, or the Art of Govern∣ing
Men, who is not in some measure
conversant in the Mysteries of Human
Nature, as well those which concern the
Constitution and Fabrique of the Body,
as those which belong to the Inclinations
and Passions of the Mind. And, the
Reason hereof is obvious and plain; since
the Maximes of sound Policy ought to be

derived from the Lawes of Nature, at
least by way of Analogie and Imitation:
& the best way to understand, how to pre∣serve
Men in Societies, is to observe, How
Nature at first produceth, and afterward
conserveth them in their single Persons, or
individual Beings. Certainly, My Lord,
the highest pitch, to which Human Wis∣dome
can aspire, is, to imitate the works of
God in his Creatures: and the most perfect
Model or Form of Government, is that,
which comes neerest to the Idea of the
Divine Constitutions, either in the larger
Volume of the Universe, or in the exact A∣bridgment
of it, the Body of Man. This
made Pythagoras call Man, the Measure
of all things. This makes the greatest
Politicians so frequently consult the ora∣culous
Aphorisms of our perpetual Dicta∣tor,
Hippocrates; and transferre His Rules
of curing Diseases of the Body, to the com∣posing
Disorders, and rectifying Distem∣pers
in the State. This Menenius A∣grippa
found a happy truth; when He, in
a moment, appeased the seditious and mu∣tinous

Commons of Rome, only by a speech,
wherein He compared the several Mem∣bers
requisite in a well-ordered Common∣weath,
to those in the Body of Man; and
shewed the Offices of Those, to be as ne∣cessary
as the Functions of These. And,
this that incomparable Sophy, the Lord
St. Alban, seems to have reflected upon,
when He said, It was without president,
that any Government had been dis∣astrous
in the hands of Learned Go∣vernours;
and doubted not to call those,
Empirique States-men, who are ignorant
in Natural Philosophy. I could, My
Lord, expatiate in this noble and ample
Theme, and permit my Pen to run into a
Parallel betwixt the several Parts in a
Body Politique, and those in the Body
Natural; and demonstrate the neer Affi∣nity
and Correspondence of them, in
their respective Uses, Actions, and wayes
of subministring to the Health and Con∣servation
of the whole: but that I here
speak to a Person, to whom such specula∣tions
are so familiar, that I should dero∣gate

from the Vastnesse of his Parts, to i∣magine
it needfull for me onely to put Him
in Mind of them, or (indeed) of any thing
else suitable to that place of Eminency, and
Condition of Dignity, to which his Virtues
have advanced Him.
Now, My Lord, these my Exercitati∣tions
being thus, in a Twofold Respect,
capable of your Lordships Favour; their
Ambition in seeking to acquire to them∣selves
more of Value and esteem, from the
Knowing and Ingenious part of Mankind
in our English World, by carrying your il∣lustrious
Name in their Front; is not only
Excusable, but also Commendable, as
being grounded on the Law of Decency,
which forbad them to addresse to any other
Sanctuary; and which evinceth, that this
their applying themselves to your Lord∣ship,
was upon due Regard, not upon Fa∣cility.
And, for my Own part; that I have ta∣ken
this way of Testifying the extraordi∣nary
Respect and Honour I bare to your
Person and Virtues: this is to be imputed,

partly to the Humility of my Condition;
which permits me not to be so happy, as to
have any better Means, or Opportunity
of expressing my Devotion; and partly to
my Gratitude, for the many singular Fa∣vours
Your Generosity long since con∣ferred
upon me, which alwayes urgeth me,
in the best manner I am able, to acknowledg
my selfe,
My most Honoured Lord,
