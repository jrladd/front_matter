SIR,
IF the Author and the work bee conside∣red, it is no hard matter to finde, to whom the Au∣thor should first of all offer his worke. A sonne cannot

present his labours more fitly then to a Father, e∣specially when they bring with them so excellent a thing as Blessednesse. And although I know you haue beene an ancient Trauailer in the path of Felicitie, so that the commendation of your posteritie shall bee to follow your steps, yet I am assured, it cannot but bee a comfort to you, to see some increase from aboue, where your careful education hath planted & watered below; in which you haue farre ex∣ceeded the vsuall prouidēce of Fathers, that ordinarily lookes no farther then the bodie, pride, and earth. I cōfesse, the outward shewes

of this world had so farre transported me, that I was very vnlikely to haue made this kinde of Matter the maine busines of my Time, but I tooke ship to goe to Tarsus, euen to forraine Countries, and in mine owne beganne the studie of the Law, vntill a storme from heauen chased mee a∣way to the studie of Eter∣nitie, wherein I haue found so much comfort and assi∣stance from aboue, that the incouragement thereof is to mee in stead of a voice speaking in mine eare; This is the way, walke in it: And in this way I desire to walke as stedfastly, as bodi∣ly infirmitie, and the neces∣sarie

distractions of this life will permit, vntill my Time shall bee no more, that so I may passe immediately from the contemplation of Felicitie, vnto the fruition. This felicitie I likewise wish vnto you with most hum∣ble and heartie prayer, and that this worke following may giue some (though small) aduancement to it, that so you may reape a little, where you haue sown much.
From my house in Laurake, Aprill 29.
