RIGHT WORSHIPFULL,
GReat is the love of Christ to his 1 Ioh. 3. 16. Saints, and gracious is the effect thereof in them, which is their Christian charity one to another. This is not in word neither in tongue onely, but Verse 18. in deed, and in truth: and such is that of your Worship to mee. This is a comfort; but what shall I say? it inferres a difficulty, it must bee mutuall, love requires a requitall, and how can Cleanthes requite a reall, a golden love with the airie store of his phantasie? For po∣verty is the patrimony of the Muses. Noble

Sir, though Momus reckon, that letters are but the clouds of Helicon, yet in Apolloes esteeme they are durable riches: yea so lovely is learning, and gracious are the Muses, that Favin. Parisien. in his Theatr. Honor. the Rose is become their livery, and the Hie∣roglyphick of such as love them; and good rea∣son, for most tried is the truth of that posie: Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori: For Th' Immortal Sisters Chaplets in their bowers, They wither not, as doe all other flowers.
Reject not therefore (I humbly intreat) this poore present of my rustick muse, the testi∣mony of my love; so shall my little infant be∣ing swadled in the gentle bands of your most worthy acceptance, batten at the last among men, and its parent shall be bound to continue,
