SIR, amongst many which most deseruedly loue you, though I the least, yet am loth to be the last, whose ende∣uours may make knowne how highly they esteeme of your noble and kinde disposition; Let this Epistle Sir (I beseech you) which vnworthily weares the badge of your worthy name, acknowledge my zeale with the rest, (though much lesse deseruing) which for your sake, doe honour the house of the Mounsons. I know true generositie accepteth what is zealously offred, though not euer deseruingly excellent; yet for loue of the Art from whence it receiueth resemblance. The light Phrigian harmony stirreth delight, as well as the melancholy Doricke moueth passion; both haue their motion in the spirit, as the liking of the soule moueth the affection. Your kinde acceptance of my labour, shall giue some life to my Muse, which yet houers in the vncertaintie of the ge∣nerall censure.
