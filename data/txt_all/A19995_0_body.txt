RIght Honourable, this sermon being prea∣ched at the funerall of your louing, and religious Sister Mris. Neale, hath beene to me (as most children are to their parents) Both cause
of griefe, and cost: but in what manner I think not fit∣ting to publish, let the world imagine it was by the dread∣full blasts of malediction, & enmity: for , euill words wound deeper then sharpe swords, & are the cause of much con∣tention: & albeit I can looke for no other but that perget maledicere, qui nunquam bene loqui didicit; he will not cease to speake euill who neuer learnt too speake well: yet in the midst of these blustring fu∣ries this is my comfort that many wise and learned fa∣thers
(out of whose wels I haue drawne much for the furnishing of this little worke) haue in time past beene as little beholding to such as now I am; and there∣fore at length I haue learnt this wisdome that vituperari ab illaudato viro laudari est, it is the greatest praise to be dis∣praysed of an vnworthy man: so that the sole care I now take for my wandring orphane, is that he may by his trauell atteine that fauour to be receiued to your ho∣nours seruice, and I shall then assure my selfe that nec oleum,
nec operā perdidi, praying from my heart that he may do your honour that good ser∣uice his place requires, to which end I cease not to pray to the Lord God that hee would preserue your honour vnblameable in your soule, and body vntill the day of his appearing.
