IF the many cros∣ses & temptati∣ons with which the life of all men, euen the most godly is distressed, be seriously weigh∣ed,

and withall the great dis∣consolation that too often sur∣priseth the hearts of most Christians, be compassionate∣ly thought on: and if with all the singular glory of a godly mind framed vnto vnmoue∣able rest, and stedfast con∣tentment, be throughly con∣ceiued of; it cannot but bee manifest, that if a way can bee shewed how a Christian may fill his heart with com∣fort in any condition hee can fall into, in respect of afflic∣tion, that such a course is pro∣fitable, and all ought to take notice of it, and with all care and paines imploy themselues about it. This by Gods assi∣stance

vpon apparent groūds of Scripture I haue indeuou∣red to shew in this Treatise; and doubt not but by experi∣ence humble and godly Chri∣stians will finde much refre∣shing and establishment of heart, if they apply them∣selues distinctly & diligently to draw of the water of life, out of those wells of saluation, opened for them euery where in this roule of Gods Promi∣ses.
This Treatise I present to your Worships, and vnder the countenance of your names, desire to commend it vnto the Church of God: and this I am induced to doe for

diuers reasons: your for∣wardnesse in the profession of sincere Religion for many yeares, the publike seruice you haue done in your Coun∣try in the administration of Iustice, for the incourage∣ment of the good, and refor∣mation of abuses, your great care from time to time to plant painfull and profitable teachers in the places of your abode, together with the ex∣cellent gifts with which God hath furnished your mindes, deserue to be freely and pub∣likely acknowledged in the Church of God; and in mine owne particular I haue beene so many waies obliged, that

with much gladnesse I em∣brace this occasion, to let the world know my desire to bee thankfull for the many helps & furtherances my ministry hath receiued from the coun∣tenance & endeuours of both your Worships, as occasion hath at any time bin offered. Desiring your acceptance hereof, and praying God to preserue you in his fear with∣out offence, till the Day of Christ, and to inlarge in you the desire & power of wel-do∣ing in all things, I end and rest, Isleworth, Octo. 1618.
