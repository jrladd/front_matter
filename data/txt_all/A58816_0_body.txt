SIR,
I Do not think my self obliged to make an A∣pology
to the World for the publication of
this Sermon, which you very well know, Sir, is
none of my act, and I am sure was far from my
intention when I composed it; indeed, as for the
faults of the Sermon, I alone am responsible, but
then it ought to be considered that the more faul∣ty
it is, the more obedience I have shewn in the
publication of it; and indeed, it would have
very ill become me, especially after I had been
preaching up Submission to Superiours, so far
to have contradicted my own Doctrine by my
Practice, as not to have complied with the re∣peated
desires of the learned and reverend Iudge,
your self and those loyal Gentlemen of the Grand
Iury. I know very well that Discourses of this na∣ture
are but too needfull in such an Age as this,
wherein the minds of the People, by sucking in
the contagious breath of false Teachers, are so
wofully infected with seditious and rebellious
Principles; against which I have herein endea∣voured

to prescribe as much antidote as the nar∣row
compass of a Sermon would contain; but in
so short a Discourse it is a hard matter to doe
justice to so copious an argument. And I am
apt to think, Sir, that had not your judgment
been too much bribed by the known candour and
goodness of your nature, by your kindness to the
Authour of it, and especially by your immoveable
Loyalty to your Prince, which could never be
shock'd by all the late attempts of a popular
Faction, you would have found defects enough
in it to have excused me for my own credit sake
from publishing it to the World; but since it
must be, I pray God it may answer your honest
intention, which I am very sure was to doe good
to the World by it, to open the eyes of those mi∣serably
misled Souls that in numerous droves
have been seduced into Faction and Disloyalty,
and to direct their wandring steps into the paths
of righteousness and peace and obedience. I
remain,
Sir,
