SIR,
THE Ʋniting of Christians is so ve∣ry desirable a thing, that the bring∣ing it to pass will deserve the utmost of our Care and Pains; whoever offers any thing that tends this way, deserves to be heard. The Mischiefs of causeless Sepa∣ration from one another, are not easily to be reckon'd up: On the other hand, the Advan∣tages of Ʋniting upon tolerable Terms are exceeding great. Ʋpon these Considerations I think the following Papers well worthy to

be made publick; and no Man (I hope) will think it unseasonable to publish them at this time, when there are on foot honest Designs and Endeavours of procuring a lasting Ʋnity among our selves. This Opportunity which we have of effecting it, I hope, will not be lost; and I shall much rejoice, if these fol∣lowing Papers will any way contribute to so blessed an End: Ʋpon that Score it is, that I cannot but commend them to the Considera∣tion of all that wish well to our common Chri∣stianity; and, considering the Authors, and Occasion of this following Letter, I cannot think it will be unacceptable to any that are Protestants.
I need not tell you why I prefix your Name: 'Tis but just that it should return to him, from whom the Copy, and the Opportu∣nity of Printing it came. I trust, you will have no Cause to repent that you consented to this Publication: It is high time, in our se∣veral Places, to do all we can to the putting

an End, as much as may be, to our unhappy Differences.
God of his Mercy inspire us all with the Spirit of Peace and Charity, of Meekness and Modesty, and mutual Forbearance; and grant that we may mind the Things that make for Peace, and for the Edifying of one another.
I am, in great Sincerity, SIR,

October 21. 1689.
