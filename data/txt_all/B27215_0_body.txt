Honoured Sir,
THE Learned and Famous Lord Ve∣rulam, delivering his Opinion of the Dedication of Books, declares himself no Friend to Addresses of that Nature; be∣cause Books ought to have no Patrons but Truth and Reason. But had that Right Honourable Personage received so many signal and noble Favours from any one, as you have liberally dispensed to me and mine, I am apt to believe he would himself have Licensed the Dedication of this Discourse to you, especially if I had first convinced him (as I could by many unanswe∣rable Arguments, were he now living) that that Book which may be allowed to shelter it self under your Pa∣tronage, may be truly said to have both Truth and Reason for its Patrons: Your great Truth, Justice and
Integrity, being as well known to all that have any Concerns with you, as your strong Reason is to those that dare attempt to converse you. But I fear, Sir, I commit a Rape upon your Modesty, and grow troublesom to you, by presenting you (though only) with this small Map of your Vertues, which I know you desire should rather be as a Terra incognita, than that many Eyes should travel over, and make disco∣veries of them. I shall not therefore put you to the Penance of reading more of your own (though just) Commendations, but beg your Pardon for this Violence offered to your Nature, by forcing your Name from the Privacy of your so beloved Retirement into a publick View; the Grant whereof will be no small Accession to those Kindnesses and Favours, which have entitled you to the Publick Acknowledgments of,
Honoured Sir, 

Ansty, Octob. 19. 1678.
