THose who desire the favour of a Prince, do commonly intro∣duce
themselves by presenting him with such things as he
either values much, or does more than ordinarily delight
in; for which reason he is frequently presented with Horses, Arms,
Cloath of Gold, Iewels, and such Ornaments as are sutable to his
Quality and Grandeur. Being ambitious to present my self to your
Highness with some testimony of my devotions towards you, in all my
Wardrobe I could not find any thing more precious (at least to my
self) than the knowledge of the Conduct and Atchievements of Great
Men, which I learn'd by long conversation in modern affairs, and a
continual investigation of old: after long and diligent examinati∣on,
having reduced all into a small Volume, I do presume to present
to your Highness; and though I cannot think it a work fit to appear
in your presence, yet my confidence in your bounty is such, I hope it
may be accepted, considering I was not capable of more, than pre∣senting
you with a faculty of understanding in a short time, what
for several years, with ininite labour and hazard I had been ga∣thering
together. Nor have I beautified or adorned it with Rheto∣rical
Ornations, or such outward imbellishments as are usual in such
descriptions. I had rather it should pass without any approbation,
than owe it to any thing but the truth and gravity of the matter. I
would not have it imputed to me as presumption, if an inferior per∣son
as I am, pretend not only to treat of, but to prescribe, and regulate
the proceedings of Princes: for as they who take the Landskip of a
Country, to consider the Mountains, and the nature of the higher
places, do descend ordinarily into the Plains, and dispose themselves
upon the Hills, to take the prospect of the Valleys; in like manner,
to understand the nature of the people, it is necessary to be a Prince,
and to know the nature of Princes, 'tis as requisit to be of the people.
May your Highness then accept this Book with as much kindness as
it is presented; and if you please diligently and deliberately to re∣slect
upon it, you will find in it my extreme desire that your High∣ness
may arrive at that Grandeur which Fortune and your Accom∣plishments
do seem to presage; from which pinacle of Honour, if your
Highness vouchsafes at any time to look down upon things below,
you will see how unjustly, and how continually I have been exposed
to the malignity of fortune.
