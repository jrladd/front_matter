PErusing my paper notes, and finding some heads of do∣ctrine touching this argumēt of tillage, deliue∣red vpō occasion of my calling to the publike place: & withall considering, and vnfainedly



bewailing the hard hap of the generall expected hope, for the necessarie redresse of the dan∣gerous decay thereof; as a wel∣willer of the common good of my coūtry, I haue added these my second thoughts to my for∣mer meditations, to be (if may be) as a further spurre for the more speedy reforming of this grosse abuse, or at least a Chri∣stian warning to preuent a fur∣ther mischiefe. VVhich my best endeauour I present to you (right worshipfull) not onely as a pawne of greater duties purposed for your kind de∣serts, but for that I am perswa∣ded



of your innocencie and harmelesnesse herin, as also of the honestie and vprightnesse of your hart for your countries good. For howsoeuer some in secret may vncharitably cen∣sure you, and put you in the ca∣talogue of the iustly accused: and so nibble at your credite, as one not altogether free from this great offence: Yet dare I be bold to ingage my poore credite, that whatsoeuer action of yours hath but a shew of any hinderance, you would be rea∣dy to redresse, and most willing to redeeme with any tolerable priuate losse for the publicke



gaine. And so beseeching the almighty to increase your loue to our Church and common-wealth, that still you may pro∣cure the profite and welfare of them both, by all possible pur∣pose and practise; I commend you to Gods grace, with the good successe of this needfull businesse. From my poore stu∣dy in Sheas by this of Aprill. 1611.
