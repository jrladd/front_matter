SIR,
AMong several Eminent Marks of your Greatness of Mind for promoting the Publick Good, that of your Bounty for the Advancement of Ex∣perimental and Real Knowledge, by the Founding a Physico-Mechanical Lecture,
deserves to be Recorded as One, and more especially by me whom you have honoured by establishing your first Lecturer. As an Earnest of others more considerable shortly to follow, I here present you with one of my Discourses in that Employment, which though short and plain, conteins somewhat of Information which the Learned have hi∣therto desired, though almost with despair. As I hope their kind Acceptance will pro∣duce their thanks to you to whom they are justly due, so your Acceptance will incou∣rage me in the further prosecution of these Inquiries to approve my self,
Noble Sir,  
From Gresham Colledge, March 25. 1674.
