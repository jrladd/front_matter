MADAM,
COuld any intrest prevail with me to address a Person undeserving, my task would then be easier much; as the Painter who has a Face before him, indifferent to Paint, knows his chief busi∣ness is to flatter; he knows he is not to draw a Face, but make one. But, Ma∣dam, I have so Beautyful a Pattern be∣fore me, my Eyes grow dazzled, and my Soul is aw'd; your Ladyship is indeed an Original, a ravishing Original. I here present you the Miscellany of Love; in my Opinion, a very humble present, yet very suitable; the  of all that's

Good and Lovely, your Ladyship is presented by Nature to the World. So much Beauty, with so much goodness mingled, scarce ever met before; so much, that I hope humbly there's enough of both to smile on, and for∣give the weak Endeavours of
Madam,
