WEE are all prisoners for a debt
we owe to Nature, commit∣ted
to the Gaole of this tran∣sitory
world: Some pay soo∣ner:
Some later: All must pay.
As yesterday, our Blessed Saviour paid
it: To day your deare Husband paid it: A
bitter example sweetly followed: He fol∣lowed

Him in his life: He followed Him
in his death: and so close in both, that as
in life, he was assuredly His by Grace, so
in death he is most certainly His in Glo∣ry.
Madam, my most entire affection
hath performed this last service to his
deare Remembrance, which I present to
your Noble hands, beseeching Almigh∣ty
God to comfort you, and hereafter to
raise you to the same pitch of Glory
where he is.
Madam,
