VOuchsafe great Lord, that art our Nations pride
In whose rare Vertues, they alone conside
To be the Patron, of my humble Muse
Who doth thee onely, her Maecenas chuse:
This work displayes the times, therefore tis meet
I should present it, humbly at thy feet
Who art no sever of the times, but thou
Will serve thy Nation, and thy help allow
For to maintain their Priviledges and be
A propogator, of Gods veritie.
To thee therefore great Lord, this work I give
That I and it, may in thy favour live.
