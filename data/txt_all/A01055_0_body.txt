My Honour'd Friends,
THe account of some leisurable houres, is here summ'd vp, and offered to exa∣mination. Importunity of Others, or Opinion of mine owne, hath not vrg'd on any confidence of running the hazard of a censure. As plurali∣ty hath reference to a Multitude, so, I care not to please Many: but whre there is a Parity of condition, there the freedom of constructi∣on, makes the best musicks. This concord hath equally held betweene YOV THE PATRONES, and ME THE PRESENTOR. I am cleer'd of all scruple of dis-respect on your parts; as I am of too slacke a Merit in my selfe. My presumption of comming in Print in this kind, hath hitherto been vn-reprooueable. This Piece, being the first, that euer

courted Reader; and it is very possible, that the like complement with Me, may soone grow out of fashion. A practice of which that I may auoid now, I commend to the continuance of your Loues, the memory of HIS, who without the protestation of a seruice, is readily your Friend,
