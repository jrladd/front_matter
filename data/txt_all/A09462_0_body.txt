RIGHT Honorable, as Iohn
the Baptist was in one desert,Mat. 3.
so our Sauiour Christ he was
in an other:Mat. 4. 1. but as these two
differed in their being in the
world: so did they not accord
in their being in the wildernesse. Iohn was with
some men, Christ with none; Iohn was with wild
men, Christ with wild beasts; Iohn was preach∣ing,
Christ praying; Iohn was baptizing, Christ
fighting; Iohn was feeding, Christ fasting; Iohn
was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Christ
did encounter with the Prince of those Diuels.
From Iohn preaching in the desert, learne we

diligence in our callings: from Christ tempted
in the desert, see we troubles at our calling:
Psa. 34. 19 Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the
Lord deliuereth them out of all.
If it please you to giue these after-lines the
reading, you shall see set downe that monoma∣chie
or single combat, which was hand to hand
betwixt Christ and the Diuell. And as for
Christ Iesus, you shall see him fasting, fighting,
conquering. Fasting and an hungry, to shew he
was man: fighting & encountring, to shew he was
Messiah; and conquering and triumphing, to
shew he was God. And as for the diuell, you shall
see him obiecting, answering, flying. Obiecting,
thatMat. 4. 3. Christ might despaire;Mat. 4. 6. answering, that he
might presume; andMat. 4. 11 flying, when he could not o∣uercome.
In Christs temptations, we see the estate of
the1. Pe. 2. 21 Church; in Satans assault, we see his malice
to the1. Pet. 5. 8 Church. Is Christ tempted? thinke it not
strange if we fall intoIoh. 15. 20 tēptations. For the griefe
of the head, is the griefe of the1. Cor. 12▪ 26. members: & the
temptations of Christ, shew the temptations of
Ioh. 15. 20▪ Christians. It is true of Christ, thatAct. 14. 21 by many
tribulatiōs he did enter into the kingdom of God:
thatHeb. 2. 10 our High Priest was consecrated by affli∣ctions,
that so he must suffer and enter into his
Luk. 24. 26. glory.

He is no sooner borne into the world, but he is
Mat. 2. 14 hunted by Herod; baptized at Iordan,Mat. 3. 16▪ 4. 1. but Sa∣tan
sets on him; a Preacher for repentance, but
theIoh. 7. 1. Scribes proscribe him; toLuk. 11. 15. worke miracles,
but the Pharisees slaunder him. He is no sooner
to suffer, butIoh. 12. 27 the Diuell assaults him; apprehē∣ded,
but theIoh. 18. 28 Iewes deliuer him; deliuered, but
Luk. 23. 11. Herod derides him; derided, butLuk 23. 24. Pilate con∣demnes
him; condemned, but the souldiersMat. 27. 27. a∣buse
him. Is he on the crosse? theMat. 27. 39. people will not
pitie him: is he risen? the high Priests willMat. 28. 15. be∣lie
him. In a word, is he vpon earth? he is tem∣pted
in hisLuk. 11. 16. person; is he in heauen? he isAct. 9. 4. temp∣ted
in his members. Thus the life of Christ was
a warfare vpon earth, and the life of Christians
must be a warfare vpon earth. We liue here in a
sea of troubles: the sea is the world, the waues
are calamities, the Church is the ship, the anker
is hope, the sailes are loue, the Saints are passen∣gers,
the hauen is heauen, and Christ is our Pi∣lot.
When the sea can continue without waues,
the shippe without tossings, and passengers not
be sicke vpon the water, then shall the Church
of God be without trials. We begin this voyage
so soone as we are borne, and we must saile on
till our dying day.
We do reade in Gods word of many kinds of
temptations: God, Satan, Man, the World, &

the Flesh, are said to tempt. God tempteth man
to trie his obedience, Satan tempteth man to
make him disobedient: men do tempt men to try
what is in them: and man tempteth God, to trie
what is in him. The world is a tempter, to keepe
man from God: and the flesh is a tempter, to
bring man to the Diuell. So God tempted A∣braham
Gen. 22. 1 in the offering of his son: SatanIob. 1. 18 temp∣ted
Iob in the losse of his goods: a1. King. 10. 1. Queene tem∣pted
Salomon in trying his wisedome: menEx. 17▪ 3. tēp∣ted
God by distrust in the desert: the world
tempted Demas,1. Tim. 4. 10. when he forsooke the Apo∣stles:
and the flesh tempted Dauid,2. Sa. 11. 4 when he
fell by adulterie. Doth God tempt vs? take heed
of hypocrisie: doth Satan tempt vs? take heed of
his subtiltie: doth man tempt man? take heed of
dissembling: doth man tempt God? take heed of
inquiring: doth the world tempt man? take heed
of apostacie: doth the flesh tempt man? take heed
of carnalitie. But do we so? are we warie of these
tempters? No, we are not, and therefore we fal.
We fal on the right hand, by temptations in pros∣peritie,
and we fall on the left, by temptations
in aduersitie. Of the one it may be said, it hath
slaine1. Sa. 18. thousands: of the other, that it hath
slaine ten thousands.
When we come and see cities dispeopled, hou∣ses
defaced, and wals pulled downe, we say, the

souldier hath bene there: and when we see pride
in the rich, discontent in the poore, and sinne in
all, we may iustly say, the Tēpter hath bin there.
Now of all other temptations, it pleaseth God
to suffer his Church to be tempted with afflicti∣ons.
It is neuer free either from the sword of Ish∣mael:
which isGen. 21. 9 a reuiling tong: or the sword of
Esau, aGen. 27. 41. persecuting hand. Neither was there
yet euer Christian man found, who had not his
part in the cup of affliction. We must drinke of
theMat. 20. 23. same cuppe our maister did:Mat. 10. 24. the disciple is
not aboue his maister.
The reasons why God doth visit vs thus with
afflictions,Reasons why God doth afflict his children▪ are: 1. To humble vs. 2. To weane
vs. 3. To winow vs. 4. To preuent vs. 5. To teach
vs. 6. To enlighten vs. 7. To honour vs. 8. To
cure vs. 9. To crowne vs. 10. To comfort vs.
11. To protect vs. 12. To adopt vs. And last of
all, to teach & comfort others. ToEc. 3. 10. humble vs,
that we be not proud:Psal. 119. 67. to weane vs, that we loue
not this world:Luk. 22. 31. to winnow vs, that we be not
chaffe:Psal. 119. 71. to preuent vs, that we do not sinne:Psal. 39. 9 40. 1. to
teach vs, that we be patient in aduersitie: toGe. 42. 21 en∣lighten
vs, that we see our errors: toIam. 5. 11 honor vs,
that our faith may be manifest: to cure vs, that
weDeu▪ 32 15. surfet not of securitie: to2. Tim 4. 7. crowne vs, that
we may liue eternally: toIoh. 6. 33 comfort vs, that he
may send his spirit:: toAct. 12. 7 protect vs, that he may

guide vs by his Angels: toHe. 12. 7. adopt vs, that we may
be his sonnes:2. Pet. 2. 5 and to teach others, that they see∣ing
how sin is punished in vs, they may take heed
it be not found in them: that they2. Cor. 1. 6 seeing our
comforts in troubles, may not be discouraged in
the like trials.
Thus a Christian mans diet is more sowre thē
sweet: his physicke is more aloes then honie: his
life is more a pilgrimage then a progresse: & his
death is more despised then honoured. This if
men would thinke of before, afflictions would be
as welcom to the soule of man, asRuth. 2. 8 afflicted Ruth
was to the field of Boaz. But because we looke
not for them before they come, think not on Gods
doing when they are come, and do desire to be
happie both here and hereafter: therfore we can
away with the name of Naomi, but in no case
would we be calledRuth 1. 20. Mara. WeIon. 1. 15. see the sea, not
the whale: theExod. 14 11. Egyptian, not the saluation: the
Dan. 6. 16 22. Lions mouth, not him that stoppeth the Lions
mouth. If we could see God in our troubles, as2. King. 6. 16. E∣lisha
did in his, then would we say: There are
more with vs, then there are against vs. But be∣cause
we do not, therefore at euery assault of the
Assyrians, we say, as the seruant to2. King. 6. 15. Elishah did:
Alas maister, what shall we do? and with the dis∣ciples:
Mar. 4. 38 Carest thou not maister that we perish?
Yet it is good for vs to suffer affliction.Iam. 1. 12. Iob. 5. 17 Blessed is

the man that endureth temptation: for when he
is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which
the Lord hath promised to thē that loue him. It
isPro. 3. 11 commanded by God,Mat. 4. 2. practised by Christ,
2. Tim. 3. 12. yeelded to by the Saints,Psal. 119. 71. assigned by Gods pro∣uidence,
and good for vs each way. We are Gods
Psal. 1. 4. trees, we shall grow better by pruning: Gods po∣mander,
smell better by rubbing: Gods spice, be
more profitable by bruising: and Gods conduits,
we are the better by running. Let vs suffer affli∣ctions,
they are2. Cor. 4. 17. momentanie in respect of time:
Phil. 1. 29 fauors, if we respect Gods loue, and a meanes to
bring vs to the kingdome of God. If they did con∣sume
vs, we might wish them an end: but they do
purge vs, let vs be content. TheyAct 14. 21. 1. Pet. 1. 5. are Gods fan,
we are Gods wheate: they are Gods boulter, we
are Gods meale: they are GodsExod. 3. flame, we are
Gods bush: they are GodsGe. 22. 9. cords, we are Gods sa∣crifice:
they are Gods frnace, we are Gods gold.
The wheate will not be good without the fan, nor
the meale without the bolter, nor the bush with∣out
the flame, nor the sacrifice without the cords,
nor the gold without the fornace: they are trials,
not punishments, if we be sons: punishments, not
trials, if we be slaues. Let vs then beare thē, they
Psal. 37. 37. will haue an end: ioyPs. 126. 5 will follow: theyIsa. 38. 10 shew vs
our weaknesse: theyHos. 5. 15. moue vs to pray: theyLuk. 24. 26. shew
we are in the path way to heauen: andEcc. 1. 2. make vs

contemne this present world. By them we2. Sam. 24. 17. learn
to repent vs of sin past,Ge. 39. 9 to take heed of sinne pre∣sent,
and to foresee sin to come. By them weAct. 2. 2. re∣ceiue
Gods spirit,Phi. 3. 10 are like to Christ: are ac∣quainted
D 23. 17 with Gods power: haueExod. 15. 1. ioy in deliue∣rance:
know benefite of prosperitie: made more
hardie to suffer: and1. Pet. 1. haue cause to practise
many excellent vertues. They cause vs (as one
saith) to seeke out Gods promise: the promise to
seeke faith: faith to seeke prayer: and prayer to
find God.Mat. 7. 7 Seeke, and ye shall find:Iob. 22. 27. call, and he
will answer:Hab. 2. 3 waite, & he wil come. I am to write
an Epistle, I must not be long. IobsIob 2. messengers
came not so fast on him: but Iobs afflictions may
come as fast vpō vs. Hath Dauid slaine1. Sam. 17. 37. a Bere?
he shall encounter with a Lion: hath he killed a
Lion?1. Sa. 18. 27. he must fight with Goliah: hath he sub∣dued
Goliah? he must make a rad vpon the Phi∣listims:
are the Philistims conquered?1. Sa. 21. Saul wil
assault him. Remēber Dauids troubles, and fore∣see
what may be our troubles. The more righte∣ous
we are, the more manifold are our troubles:
and the better we are, the better we may indure
them.
But as our troubles are many, so are our deli∣uerances
many: God will deliuer vs out of all. He
that deliueredGen. 7. Noah frō the floud,Gen. 19. Lt frō So∣dome,
Gen. 33. Iacob from Esau,Gen. 41. 14. Ioseph from Potiphar,

Moses from Pharaoh,Exod. 9.Exod. 12▪ Israell frō Egypt,1. Sa. 19. Da∣uid
from Saul,1. King. 21. Eliah from Acab,2. Kin. 6. Elysha from
the Syrians,2. King. 5. Naaman from his leprosie,Isa. 38. Heze∣chiah
from the plague,Dan. 3. the three children from
the fire,Dan. 6. Daniel from the Lions,Mat. 6. Ioseph from
Herod, the ApostlesAct. 5. from the Iewes,Mat. 4. and Christ
from the Diuell: he, euen he will either deliuer
vs frō trouble, or comfort vs in trouble, or miti∣gate
troubles when they come vpon vs.
He,Ro. 4. 21 he hath promised to do it, and he that
hath promised, is able to do it. And this he doth
sometimes by no meanes, sometimes by small
means, sometimes by ordinarie means, sometimes
by extraordinarie, sometimes contrarie to all
meanes. By noIoh. 5. 9. meanes he cured a creeple at
Bethesda: byIoh. 6. 12 small meanes he fed fiue thousand
in the desert: byMat. 4. 7 ordinarie meanes he was
brought from the pinnacle: by meanes extraor∣dinarie
he was prouided for in hunger:Mat. 411▪ and con∣trarie
to all meanes were theDan. 5. three children
preserued in the fornace of fire.
I haue good cause to thinke of Gods gracious
deliuerance, being my selfe deliuered frō a great
trouble.Saint An∣drewes in Norwich. Since the time I was vnkindly dismissed
from my poore charge, where I would haue con∣tinued,
if malice had not hindred me, I haue li∣ued
in an end of this City: dangerously in respect
of the sicknesse; poorely, in regard of maintenāce;

and painfully, in respect of my ministerie: yet ti
this time hath the Lord deliuered me: and 
Paule said:2. Tim. 1 18. he will deliuer me, if that he se
it be best for me.
Let man therefore1. Sam. 30. 9. comfort himselfe in the
Lord:Hos. 6. 2. after two dayes he will reuiue vs, and
the third day he will raise vs vp againe:Psal. 30. 5 Heaui∣nesse
may endure for a night, but ioy will come in
the morning.Psal. 58. 11. Doubtlesse there is a reward for
the righteous: verily,Mica. 7. 8. God retaineth not his
wrath for euer. Could he ouercome the world,
and can he not ouercome many troubles in the
world? Yea, let one plague follow another, as one
quaile sings to another: yet as theAct. 28. 3 viper leaped
on Paules hand, and forthwith leaped off again,
so one trouble shall leape vpon the righteous,
and anon leape off againe:Ps. 37. 4. though he fall, he
shall rise againe, the righteous shall not be forsa∣ken
for euer.
If he hath deliuered vs from the guilt of our
sinnes, he will deliuer vs from the punishment of
our sins. Let vs then therefore be patient in trou∣ble,
constant in hope, rooted in loue: let vs waite
 he will come, call and he will heare, beleeue
and he will performe, repent vs of our euill com∣mitted
against him, and he will repent of his euils
intēded against vs. He is ouer vs by his proui∣dence,
about vs by his Angels, in vs by his spirit,

with vs by his word, vnder vs by his power, and
vpon vs by his Sonne. In him is our helpe, from
him is our comfort, by him is our victorie, and
for him is our trouble.Psal. 25. In thee haue I trusted,
saith a king:Iob. 5. who euer was confounded that
trusted in the Lord, said a friend? and as Elanah
was to1. Sam. 1. 8. Hannah in stead of many sons, so God is
to his in stead of many comforters. Of other com∣forters,
we may say as Iob did of his friends:
Iob. 16. 2. Silly comforters are you all. They wil leaue vs,
as mice do a ruinous house: but the Lord (like
Ruth 1. 16. Ruth to Naomi) will neuer leaue vs, nor forsake
vs. Especially in the houre of death,Ecc. 41. 1. which is in
remēbrance bitter to great men: in that houre of
death he will be with vs, and command hisLuk. 16. 26. An∣gels
to take charge of our soules, theIsa. 57. 2. earth to be
as a bed for our bodies: that so the oneLuk. 23. may go in∣to
glorie, the other reserued in hope of like glo∣rie,
Phil. 3. 20 and be made one day like vnto the glorious
bodie of Christ Iesus. Thus right Honourable
you haue seene the righteous in afflictions: asPsal. 137. Is∣rael
was in Babylon: and that the Lord likeZac. 4. 6. Zo∣robabel
is readie to deliuer them. Though in tro∣bles
Christ seemes as in theMat. 8. 24. ship to sleepe, yet in
deliuerance he awakes as a man out of sleepe, and
as a Giant refreshed with wine. He will rebuke
the waues and winds of trobles and persecution,
and they shall flie before him as Sysera did be∣fore

ud. 17. 4 Debora, & the1. Sam. 14. Philistims before Ionath
and his seruant. And as Christ asking the wom
of her accusers, she answered:Ioh. 8. There was none: 
in the end aske a Christian of his troubles, & h
will say, There are none. He is a buckler for ou
left hand, and a sword in our right: he is an hel∣met
on our head, and harnesse for our bodie. We
shall look vpon troubles, asExo. 14. Israel did on the E∣gyptians,
as the1. Sam. 17. 52. Iewes did on Goliah, and as the
Grecians did on Hector, to triumph ouer them:
and as the Angell said to Ioseph:Mat. 2. 20 They are dead
that sought the childs life, so the Spirit shal say to
the afflicted, They are dead that did seeke your
life. A day of deliuerance, a yeare of Iubile will
come, and thenGen. 41. Ioseph shall be out of prison,
Gen. 31. Iacob out of seruitude, andIob 41. 12 Iob shal lie no more
in the dust of the earth:1. Thes. 4. 18. Let vs comfort our
selues with these words.
I haue exceeded an Epistle, especially to such a
small booke. If the wals seeme too great for this
citie: abundans cautela non nocet. It is vsu∣all
for Students not onely to present their owne
labours, but also other mens to great personages,
especially such Works wherin they haue bene ei∣ther
Translators or ouerseers. It were infinit to
instance this point. I am bold to do the like to
your Honour at this time. This Copie it was
brought vnto my hand, I haue conferred it with

another, I haue perused it at the Presse, I heard
diuerse of the Sermons, I haue added nothing of
mine owne: and I desire, that of thoseIoh. 6. 22 many bas∣kets
ful of most delicate diet, which this worthie
man hath now left behind him, there may not so
much as any one be lost. If any such come vnto
my hand, surely they shall not be lost. By his life
had I much comfort, and I will seeke to honor
him after he is dead. I was twentie yeares ac∣quainted
with him:The Golden chaine. I at his request made the first
fruites of his labours to speake English. And now
I am bold to present this his posthume to your pa∣tronage.The Earle of Bedford. The Coun∣tesse of Bed∣ford.
