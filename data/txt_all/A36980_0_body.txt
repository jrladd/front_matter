Much Honoured LORD;
LEt the blisfull streames of Gods eternall mercies, run plentifully, through all your Parliamentary designes, and others else, to make you, as truly prosperous in your Acts of State, as Religious in your intentions for Piety, that's my desire for you. The next for my selfe, is this, that some drop of your Ho∣nours
 favour, and Clemencie, (how little soever) may through your Ho∣nourable acceptance, of this my small tender, fall on me, to make me as truly happy, in the enioyment of so great a Patronage, as I am forward in the de∣dication of the same, unto your Ho∣nour. True it is, you may wonder, I beg (thus bold) for the latter, especi∣ally being that I am so farre remote, from your Honours knowledge: but to speak iustly, there's no iust cause of marvaile, for though I am a stranger to your Person, I am not to your ver∣tuous practises, which make our He∣misphere of Great Brittaine, with ad∣miration to be acquainted with you. The booke (I confesse,) is not wor∣thy your iudicious eye, nor reading, but the Bishop in it, I am confident you love with all your heart: straying
 sheep, (I have heard) your desire is, should returne to the fold, imitating here our great Shepheard, that makes welcome all the Flock, that come. VVhat you finde amisse, in the hand∣ling of the propounded subject, wch is good, let your love to goodnes par∣don, and what otherwise in the rash attempt, of so bold an adventure as this upon your goodnesse is, let your wounted mildnesse passe by. Great∣nesse in you (I beleeve) is as pardon∣full as your goodnesse, for O how sweetly in you, may both Church and State see, how they goe hand in hand together? I dare not speake all I beleeve, of your almost unparal∣lell'd pietie, tis enough for me, to see it, and to heare it abroad, but for feare of suspition of unpleasing flattery, to your selfe, I dare not speake. VVhat now is to bee spoken for the present
 on my behalfe, hath an eye upon your mercy, that you would vouchsafe the same, (though undeserved,) upon the worke and Author. So shall I that am but even the smallest of Christs mi∣nistry, be encouraged in the painefull worke of the Lord, and endeavour daily, (if not more,) to bring Goates haire, (by no means lesse) to the buil∣ding of Gods Temple; continually morne and evening, as long as I have a day to live, praying heartily, to the eternal Trinity for you and yours, that an encrease of true honours welfare may abound on your Honourable selfe, Your truly vertuous and Reli∣gious Lady, and hopefull Progenie here, and that an immortall Crowne of endlesse glory with the communion of Saints through Iesus Christ, may be your eternall inheritance hereafter.
