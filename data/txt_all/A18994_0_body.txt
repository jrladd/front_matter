THe singular good af∣fection (right wor∣shipfull) I haue rea∣ped at your handes, deserueth more at mine, than a bare imitation of lear∣ning: Neuerthelesse for the loue you beare me, I haue aduentured (and the rather) to present these labors, what∣soeuer they may seeme vnto you, to signifie asvvel the continuance of my studies, vvherein you haue encoura∣ged me, as to manifest that desire I should haue, to shew my selfe as vvil∣ling

to be thankfull for a benefite re∣ceiued, as any reason would I should be. Besides the argument it self consi∣dered, our modern natures, and mine owne imperfection togither, might iustly moue no lesse. When there∣fore I considered (first) that you fa∣uour the Authour, next, so well ap∣pointed to defend the worke (the re∣galitie, laws, and customes of this land vntouched) I reasoned thus, Duo vin∣cula fortiora, and so it became an ob∣lation vnto you, which accepted, you receiue it from him, vvhose heart gi∣ueth it freely, and vvithall, that dutie and affection, that your former fa∣uors haue merited: and so I rest your Worships in equall duetie and affe∣ction.
