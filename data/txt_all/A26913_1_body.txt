HAving seene and heard the many (though scarce divers) Petitions to this Honorable Assembly by the Inhabitants of divers Counties and Cities of this Land, as also Corporations, Companies, and Trades, some against Bishops, some against the Common prayer, and all against such judiciall and things super-elementary to the Region of their capacity of judging, and matters onely belonging to the Judicature of this grave Synot, which seemes either to distrust, or direct, or both, your great wisedomes; Wee therefore the Gentlemen and other the Inhabitants of Corn∣wall, with as many hearts, though not hands, with as wany good wills, though not persons, not in imitation, but rather by provocation, and necessity in these times, to show our good minded affections, doe humbly prostrate the ut∣most of our service to your feet. In which (or rather after which) we take leave humbly to beg.
That you will bee pleased to bend your auxi∣liary and good affections to the redresse of the distresse of the misertble Protestants in Ireland. To gaine whose good, prosperity, peace, and tranquility, to perserve the Soveraignty of that

Land to our Royall King, and to maintaine his and this Kingdomes honour, We shall willing∣ly lay downe our lives and fortunes.
That you will bee pleased to continue your great respect, dutifull love, and true obedience to our Royall Soveraigne, by maintaining his just, and no way antelegall Prerogative.
That you will be pleased to put the Lawes in due execution against all Jesuites, Seminaries, Papists and Recusants.
That you will be pleased to looke upon the otherside, and duely weighing the actions (or ra∣ther factious) of some, (whom most men call Ci∣tizens) to scourge their irregular and disorderly schisme and hereticall Sects, into tight paths of serving God, to frequent his House, and to pray as well as heare, to allow order, and obey confor∣mity, to reverence learning, and bow to authori∣ty, to be under a discipline, and live in order.
That you will be pleased to maintaine and esta∣blish the ancient fundamentall and most venera∣ble Lawes, order and discipline, both of our Church and Commonwealth, to continue the revence'd Office, and punish the offending per∣sons of Bishops, to have in high account, and ternize as farre as in you lyes) the Divine and excellent forme of Common prayer, to correct braine forg'd doctrine, by your examplary pre∣cepts strike a reverence of Gods House into every mans breast.
That you will be pleased to intimate to the people your honorable and wise intentions con∣cerning

Divine Service, least while you hold your peace, some rejecting it in part, others altogether, they vainly conceive you countenance them.
Lastly, (not to trouble your great affaires any longer) That you will be pleased to take into your sage consideration, those scandalous and ill affected Pamphlets, which flye abroad in such swarmes, as are able to cloud the pure ayre of truth, and present a darke ignorance to those who have not the two wings of Justice and knowledge to fly above them.
Now to polish this our worke with a smooth demonstration of our modest intents, that the tinctures which in introduction fell on the forementioned presents, may slide without a staine from this; Wee doe in all humility de∣clare, that neither distrust of your intentions, nor opinion of any of our councels worthy your eares ever tainted our thoughts, but that we have still beene and are confident, that this most wise Synod hath ever thought fit, resolv'd and will confirme into action, what wee now humbly request, therefore this our present, not so much a Petition as a prayer of willing and thankefull hearts for the hop'd sequell, is onely to shew our true intentions and good∣will towards his gracious Majestie, and this high Court, as Instruments of the peace of our soules and bodies, for which wee are unani∣mously and immutably resolv'd to spend our dearest blood.

FINIS.
