MY LORD,
NO body, I hope, will accuse me of temerity, if I take the boldness to Dedicate to Your Lordship this Discourse; though hereby I have the unhappiness, to interrupt with this little Address of mine, Your more important Affairs. For no wonder if a stranger comes to implore, nay to impor∣tune Protection; even his very condition gives him title to it; since every Stranger in a Foreign Country may be look'd upon as an Orphan, without particular Kindred, Friend, or Acquaintance, it may be allow'd him to have Recourse to the First Magistrate of the City wherein he lives, as to a Publick Patron, Friend, and Father. As for my part; My Lord, 'tis true, I am not so abandoned a Stranger, but that I have found some Friendship and Cha∣rity, not only among my Countrey-men, who are here meer Strangers as my self, but also among the English-men.
 Nevertheless were I not in need of any Pro∣tection or Favour, I should be glad of an occasion to give my self the honour of approaching to Your Lordship, to manifest in describing the Hypocritical and Cruel character of an Enemy of Your Religion and Liberty, That I desire heartily the happiness of this magnificent City, of Your Lord∣ship, and of Your Honourable Brethren, who so happily steer it at this time, to its present measure of Peace and Or∣der; to congratulate it for its Loyalty and Love to so Good, so Generous, and so Illustrious a King; to Rejoice and Bless you for Your great Care and Unwearied pains, in Rooting out the Seminaries of Sedition, in supressing Irreligion and Profaneness, and doing what lies in men, for the keeping of the Unity and Concord; in which worthy deeds that you may ever proceed, and be succeeded, by the Blessing and Con∣course of Divine Providence, is, and shall be the daily Prayer of Your
(RIGHT HONOURABLE)
