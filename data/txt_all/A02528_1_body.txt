RIGHT HO:
After your long and hap∣py acquaintance with o∣ther Courts & Kingdoms, may it please you to compare with them the estate of old ISRAEL; You shall finde the same hand swaying all scepters; and you shall meet with such a proportion of dispositions, and occurrences, that you will say, men are still the same, if their names



and faces differ; You shall finde Enuie and Mutabilitie ancient Courtiers; and shall confesse the vices of men still aliue, if themselues dye; You shall see God still honouring those that honor him, and both rescuing innocence, and crowning it. It is not for mee to anticipate your deeper, and more iudicious obseruations. I am bold to dedicate this peece of my labour to your HONOR, in a thankfull acknowledgment of those noble respects, I haue found from you, both in FRANCE, and at home. In lieu of all which, I can but pray for your happines, and vow my selfe
