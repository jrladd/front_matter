My LORD;
THe secret love of Hero and Lean∣der first brought to light in the pure Greek of di∣vine Musaeus, was afterward

new moulded in Latin by the fluent Ovid; in imitation of whose Epistles, the most emi∣nent Poëts of all Climates have (in their native languages) written upon this subject so many Paraphrases and Es∣sayes, that like the numerous streames of Nile, they al∣most overflow the remem∣brance of their Fountaine. I confesse the report of Poëms borrowed from Musaeus made so great a noyse, that to mee the Authour had beene lost in the crowd of Imita∣tours,

if I had not heard his soft lines sweetned by your Lordship's accent; but then I could not be satisfied till I made triall how the Greeke would go in English: my in∣tent being to translate and de∣dicate it privately to your Lordship. The Translation was forthwith dispatched, the Dedication is now presented, but the intended Privacy lay not in my power; for my ac∣quaintance (who would know what I was doing) had in∣gaged me for so many Copies,

that I held it my safest course, rather to venture upon the Printers pardonable errours, then to runne the hazzard of grosse mistakes in ignorant Transcribers. Yet, as I could not make it altogether private, so I meant it should not be al∣together publique, and there∣fore at first I suffered no more to be printed, then the just num∣ber promised. But now, find∣ing so many freinds as challeng not a few copies but a whole Impression. I am forced to answer them, as Pisistratus

did his sons, that I have done my best to convert them to my Opinion, but since I cannot pre∣vaile, I am resolved to be of theirs; and for their sakes, what I writ for my private ex∣cercise, shal be exposed to com∣mon censure, yet among the crowd of Readers if some pre∣tending Critick shall assault me, I shall smile to see him retire with double speed, beholding the name of the illustrious and learned person that priviledges
