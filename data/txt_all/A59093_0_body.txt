AND as it were with consecrated
Flowr, and crackling grain of
Salt, I offer up in Sacrifice. I
am not in condition to do it with
a costly Victim, or a full Censer. GREAT
SIR, deign with favour to receive these
scraps of Collection; relating intirely, what
they are, and as far as the present Age may
be supposed to be concerned in ancient Sto∣ries
and Customes, to the English-British State
and Government; and so far forth to Your
most Honoured Name. Which Name of
Yours, whilest I, one of the lowermost
Bench, do with dazzled eye-sight look up∣on
(most Noble Lord, and great Support of
your Country)
I devoutly lay down Upon its ALTAR This small Earnest and Pledge
of my Obedience and Duty.
