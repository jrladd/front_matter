REVEREND MOTHER, AND RESPE∣CTED SISTERS,
Amongst the Religi∣ous Families of our Na∣tion,
I do not make the least accompt of yours, though I salute you not with the first, hauing stil expected a fitt occasion. Which being now offe∣red, it may please you to accept in good part this small Present, that I send you, in testimony of my aboundant affe∣ction, and reuerence to your Person, and holy Family.
Two things I cōmend heerin to your prudent
Consideration: to wit, CONTEMPLATION, or Mentall Prayer, which is the life and soule of Re∣ligion; and SPIRITV∣AL PROFIT, the high way to Perfectiō. Wher∣fore I haue ioyned them in one little Volume, that you may haue the vse of both togeather; for the one greatly hel∣peth the other.
Touching the Au∣thors; the former, Fr. An∣tony de Molina, yet liueth,
a most Deuout, and Re∣ligious Carthusian in Spaine. The second, F. Francis Arias, now decea∣sed, of the Society of ESVS, is a man so well knowne to the world for his singular learning & Sanctity of life, as  shal need to say nothing, see∣ing his workes are extant & printed in many Lan∣guages, which make my testimony and praise vn∣needfull.
I haue added also to
these two litle Treatises, a Dialogue of CONTRI∣TION and ATTRI∣TION: which is so fit a Remedy against Temp∣tations, and so easy, sure, and ready a way to keep friendship with God; as I doubt not, but you will receyue particuler com∣fort, and reap great be∣nefit by the frequent ex∣ercise therof.
I will not be tedious with a longer Epistle: only I desire that my
good will and zeale of your seruice, may be re∣membred in the practise of these holy Documēts. And so crauing pardon, with due Respect, I humbly take my leaue, resting.

S. Omers. 25, Ian. 1617.
