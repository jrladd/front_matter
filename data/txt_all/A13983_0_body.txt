LIcence mee (I humbly beseech your Reverend fatherhoods) with the contrite penitent: Inge∣niously to acknowledge my Er∣rour, which is over-much pre∣sumption in undertaking, more in publishing, but most in thus presenting this my Collection: But withall to appeale from the barre of Rigor, to the borde of favour, and thereat to obtaine this extenuation of censure; That being it was begun with a good intent, prosecuted to a seeming good end, and is now in all befitting hum∣blenesse presented to procure protection, that I may passe without publicke reprehension: And

sithence words and writing are not reall according as they are spoke or writ but as they are appo∣ved by others: Let your noble dispositions but make a favourable exposition of what is done: And then I am confident I shall untoucht passe the pikes of scorne and reproofe; In earnest expectation whereof, humble and hearty prayers to God, the giver of all good gifts for our long lives, in health and hearts ease here, and sempiternall happinesse hereafter, shall not want daily to bee powred out, by him that hourely rests,
