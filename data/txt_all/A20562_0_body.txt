Right Honourable:
THose many encouragements which beyond the measure of my deserts it hath pleased your gracious fa∣uour, from the ouerture of your loue, to shew towards mee, may iustly claime at my hands some thankefull acknowledgement thereof. Sapientis estLib. de bene. (said Seneca) benè debere beneficium, & benè soluere, interdum autem solutio est ipsa confes∣sio, So fals it out with me (right Honourable) who hauing receiued more then I can deserue, and wanting power to requite, Nam tibi quod soluat non habet arca Jouis: my heartiest prayers must be your best payment, and no other requitall, then a thankfull ac∣knowledgement,
 which if I should forget, I were wor∣thy (as Alexander once serued one) to be branded inPlutar. the fore-head with Ingratus hospes.
Accept therefore, I beseech you, of the offer of these my slender and worthlesse endeauours, sheltred vn∣der the patronage of your worthy name; which if you will please to grace with the viewing and reading ouer, you shall adde life to these dead lines, depriued of the breath of a liuely voyce, wherewith sometime they spake, and put now bloud & spirit into the veines of this dead carkasse, and animate it a new with the breath of your Honourable fauour, wherewith you haue animated mee in all my proceedings, and giuen life to my languishing, and faint hopes, which other∣wise would not haue beene, or beene expired. The re∣membrance of which your honourable fauours shall draw life from my last breath, and shall be a motiue daily to stirre me vp to sacrifice to you, and for you, the calues of my lips, and hourely to send vp the in∣cense of my prayers to almighty God to send downe vpon your deere Lord (my R. and H. Master) your selfe, and both your happily-ioyned Issues, what prospe∣ritie in this life can be desired, and what happinesse in the other can be conceiued.
 Yorkehouse. Aug. 29.
