Madam,
I Humbly offer Your
Grace the last sacri∣fice
of this nature
that is in my power,
having only a hope
that it may be re∣ceiv'd
by You with that favour as
when it was formerly presented. And
so, Madam, I only dare to appear in
an address to You, as others to their
Altars, who by sacrifices get pardon
for their defects, if not advance their
devotions. This was to your Sex in∣deed

a peculiar offering, whilst all
either gave as much Passion to their
Adorers, or wisht their Beauties great
enough to do it: your Graces excel∣lencies
alone have been by all admi∣rers
esteem'd at so great and just a va∣lue,
as to create, and not reward mens
passions. This with as just a reverence
I present to you, hoping for this Ro∣mantique
passion such an entertain∣ment
as none durst expect for real
ones; your severity would deny a
reception to those, which your cha∣rity
may grant to this: And believe,
he that attempts all ways to express
his respects and duty, has more then
Fortune will give him leave to shew,
The unhappy condition at this time
of
MADAM,
