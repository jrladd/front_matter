WORTHY SIR,
I Happen'd to wait on your Honour, when a Relation was brought you, of the Treatment, which some of our Nation, taken by the Dutch, in the last years Engagements, receiv'd a∣mong them. Ʋpon the hearing of that, and a reflection on what I had read in the ensuing Treatise, I imagin'd to my

self, what parallel might be made be∣tween the Slavery at Agers, and the Restraint at Amsterdam, and▪ other places in the Netherlands▪ and, ab∣stracting from the Obligations of a Christian Perswasion on the one side, I weigh'd the actions of both, by the bal∣lance of that Generosity, which may be expected from an Enemy. The result was, an inclination to believe, that down-right Mahumetisme may rise up in judgement against the feign'd pro∣fessions of Christianity in a Low-Coun∣try people, exemplary for their persidi∣ousness to their greatest Benefactors the English.
Having thereupon fix'd my thoughts on the rendring of this Piece of the Slavery of Algiers into English, I withall resolv'd to dedicate it to that Person, whose easiness of access, even

when the last years Contagion was neer the height of it's rage (a singular fa∣vour to a person of my station) had gi∣ven me the occasion of doing it. It hath pleas'd that invisible hand, which guides all humane actions, to answer the wishes I made at a great distance hence, to wit, that, at my return, I might find your Honor (as I have) in perfect health. Which indulgence of Heaven fills me with hopes, that a life so miraculously preserv'd, will, for the future, be as miraculously con∣tinu'd.
I flatter my self with a presumption of your pardon, for the roughness of this Address, especially when I reflect on the many favours I have receiv'd from your Honour since the happiness of my first being known to you. These I must confess have been so great, that

they require, not only an acknowledge∣ment, but also a publick profession of my being,
WORTHY SIR,
