TO THE Most Noble, and He∣roick Gentleman, IOHN DIGBYE. Esq. at Gothhurst.
SIR,
By making this De∣dicatory Addresse unto you, I may truely say tis done to the Renowned Authour Himself; for, besides the ordinary relation of Father and Son betwixt you, there was never, I dare boldly say,

such a perfect exact similitude twixt any two since the World be∣gan. For you resemble him, not onely in the outward Symmetry, in that goodly proportion, and comportments of your body. You are like him, not onely in Physiognomy of face, having the same spacious front, the same per∣spicacious eyes, with other visible parts so marvalously alike, but the tone of your voice, the accent of your words, your very breath, and articulate sounds are the same with his; insomuch, that it being well observed, this admira∣ble similitude, or rather Identity, may be called one of the greatest wonders of these times.
Now, Sir; this Resemblance being so exact, through all the outward parts Capapee; It may be well presumed, that you are also like him in the Idaeas of your soul, and the intern motions of your

mind, and consequently in his sublime speculations. Therefore, I hope, that neither the World will accuse me of Impertinence, or your self of presumption that I make this Dedication, and thereby stile my self.
Highly Honoured Sir,
