RIGHT REVEREND LADY, AND RELIGIOVS SISTERS,

DID not the abun∣dance of my Re∣spectfull Affecti∣on to your holy House and Fami∣ly, ouercome the distance of Place, or my small Acquain∣tance; I should not commend this little Treatise of RELI∣GIOVS PERFECTION to a Patronage so far remote from our Natiue Countrey: but ra∣ther seeke a Protectour neerer home. But seing so much Land, as lyeth betweene, doth not hinder the Fame of your Ver∣tuous

Example & austere Life, from passing into these parts: so neither shall the seas drowne my Desires of your continuall Progresse, nor stay them from aduenturing with this Present, to make them knowne vnto you.
In this RELIGIOVS MIRROVR, you may behould rare Vertues, and accordingly draw in your selues the forme of highest Perfection. Heere shall you find whatsoeuer may help to the spirituall Aduance∣ment of your soules: and by reading attentiuely, reape con∣digne fruites of your deuout Labours. The Method is easy, the Stile plaine, the Treasure

thereof infinitely rich, and the Author well knowne through the world by his worthy Trea∣tises of Piety, and Deuotion: Wherof this One may seem, by Gods speciall Prouidence, ap∣poynted for fuell to increase the fire of Deuotion in your Brests; thereby to inflame the Harts of many Worthy Perso∣nages, to an holy Emulation of your Example.
I will not trouble your Ladiship, nor the rest of your vertuous Family with a longer Epistle; but end, with many harty wishes of spirituall Light to your soules by this resplen∣dent MIRROVR, and of Hap∣pines to our afflicted Countrey

by your returne to your An∣cient SION, now forlorne and desolate by your Absence. At least, that I may meet with you in the Heauenly SION, with all Respectfullnes I craue your holy prayers. This feast of the Glorious Virgin SAINT BRI∣GIT, resting euer,
