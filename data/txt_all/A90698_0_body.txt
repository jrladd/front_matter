May it please your Grace,
HAving been some years Secretary to the King's Minister at the Court of Denmark, and brought some Memoirs from thence relating both to the Ancient and Mo∣dern
State of that King∣dom, I was prevailed with, through the Importunities of some Friends, to com∣mit them to the Press. For the Northern Regions not lying in the usual Road of our Travellers, and not being thought to have any thing sufficiently inviting as to engage them to undergo the inconvenien∣cies and hardships that at∣tend all Voyages into those Parts, nor to make such a stay as is requisite for the
rendring their Observations worthy of the Curiosity of the Age. We are gene∣rally very much in the Dark as to the Government and Manners of those People. This has made me liable, since my return from those Climats, to daily Que∣stions about them, especial∣ly of late, since the Discour∣ses of the Match between my Lady Ann, and Prince George; People beginning to accuse themselves for entertaining so slender an
Opinion of these Countries, that can produce a Prince every way so great, and endued with such Royal Qualities, as is His Royal Highness.
Though these Considera∣tions made me give way to the instancy of my Ac∣quaintance, yet I could not resolve upon the making them publick, without im∣ploring the Patronage of your Graces Illustrious Name. And though I ought to have curb'd my
Presumption from offering you up so unpolisht, and so imperfect an Oblation, yet hoping that some things in it might merit your Graces Speculation, I flatter'd my self that your Grace a∣bounding with so much goodness, would pardon in me the Ambition I had to declare the profound Zeal, Respect and Submission wherewith I am,
My Lord,
