My LORD,
WHEN I consider with what
reluctancies I appear thus in
publick; I have all reason
to suspect and fear, lest this
offering, which like an un∣willing
Sacrifice was dragg'd to
the Altar, and which hath great defects too, will
be far from propitiating either for its self or for
the votary. But I must crave leave to add, that
how averse soever I was to the publishing this
rude Discourse, I make the Dedication with
all possible zeal, and ready cheerfulness. For
I expect your Lordship to be a Patron, not
only to my Sermon, but to my Subject. Such
a separate eminence of virtue and of sweet∣ness
mixt together may hope to ingratiate
Your Function, to a Generation of men that
will not yet know their own good, but

resist mercy, and are not content to be
happy. And for my self, Your Lordships great
goodness and obligingness hath encourag'd
me, not  to hope that you will par∣don
all the miscarriages of what I now
present, but also to presume to shelter it
and my self under your Lordships Name and
Command, and to honour my self before the
World by this address, and by assuming
the relation of▪
My Lord,
