IT is neither ambition nor coue∣tousnes (Right Honourable) that moueth me to publish this Trea∣tise to the view of all, which not long since I deliuered to the eares of a few, being then Lecturer in the Citie of Lincolne: but partly the motion of some friends, partly and chiefly the satisfying of some si∣nister spirits haue in a manner wrested from me that, whereto otherwise I had little affection. Cre∣dit through writing bookes, is a thing of such dan∣gerous hazard, by reason of the varietie of censu∣rers, that it is doubtfull whether a man shall winne or lose thereby: Gaine also is so slender, as that, for a booke of a yeeres paines and studie, it will be a ve∣rie hard matter to attaine, if it were set to sale in
 Pauls Church-yard, so much money as inck, paper, and light cost him that penned it: so as except a man should doate, hee must haue better grounds of publishing his writings, than either credit or gaine: especiallie considering the plentifull haruest of bookes of all sorts, amongst which there appeareth variable contention. In some it is questionable, whether wit or learning getteth the victorie: in o∣thers the strife is betwixt wit and the truth: some bewray dissentions betwixt conscience and policie: others contend after other fashions: All declare thus much, that except a man can adde something new of his owne, it is vanitie to write bookes: for otherwise a man shal sooner get mocks than thanks for his paines. Wherefore I doe professedlie re∣nounce all ambitious affection of credit, and coue∣tous desire of gaine: and betake my self to a better refuge, which is the cleering of my selfe from vn∣iust imputations and accusations. I haue beene strangely traduced for the doctrine I taught out of the Lords Prayer: I haue been vrged to answere in defence of the doctrine I deliuered touching that subiect, before the Magistrate ecclesiastical: as if so be I called in question the truth thereof. For the cleering of the truth I am bold to publish this pre∣sent Treatise: wherein (I protest before the God of heauen, and before your Lordship) I haue truly set downe the substance of all that which I deliuered in handling the Lords Prayer. I must needes con∣fesse that it is not word for word the same (for that were impossible to me) yet to my knowledge it differeth not in any materiall circumstance: nay I
 doe verily thinke that if I misse the truth, it is rather in the writing than in the preaching. Howsoeuer it be, I most humbly beseech your Honour to vouch∣safe the patronage of this traduced Pamphlet: I must acknowledge it is presumption in me to im∣pose vpon your Honour the scandall of countenan∣cing so suspitious a writing (for who knoweth whe∣ther it shal gaine the approbation of the godly lear∣ned, when it commeth to their censure?) but for that your Lordship had the managing of the cause of difference betwixt my accusers and me concer∣ning this occasion, and for that your Honour so wisely and charitably compounded the controuer∣sie on both parts to the contentment of either of vs; your Lordship might iustly challenge a greater title herein, than any other whatsoeuer: wherefore al∣though it proue a troublesome burthen, I beseech your Honour not to refuse it: the rather for that the honourable interest which your Lordship hath in the affections and iudgements of men honestly dis∣posed, will so farre preuaile, as to cleere your Ho∣nour from the least spot of dishonour, which per∣haps might accrew through the patronage of so dangerous a tractate: yet thus much I may be bold to assure your Lordship, that this Treatise passeth with approbation to the presse; and doth not shroud it selfe in tenebris, as if it either shamed or feared the light: which may be some reason to in∣duce your Honour the rather to receiue it into your Honourable protection: for my selfe I freelie confesse, there is in me no abilitie to declare my thankfulnes to your Lordship, otherwise than by
 betaking my selfe by some such pamphlet to your Honours safe conduct: which if it shall please your Honour to affoord, I shall at all times acknow∣ledge my thankfulnes; and instantly pray for your Lordships continuance and increase in al true honor and happinesse.
