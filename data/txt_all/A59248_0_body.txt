Madam,
THough the Faith I write for
be far more firmly esta∣blish't
then Heaven and
Earth themselves, (as the Worlds
great Master has by his own word
assur'd us) and so needs no Sup∣port
but its own Invincible
Strength: Yet, I am told by my
reason, that nothing so clears and
recommends Religion to the Ge∣nerality,
as the vertuous Life and
eminent Devotion of Them that
profess it. But, where shall I seek
those happiest Effects and noblest
Arguments of Truth? If I consider

them in their abstracted Idea's they
are Invisible as Angels; too sub∣tle
and delicate for vulgar eyes.
Where then may I hope to meet
those excellent Forms vested with
Bodies? if I consult the com∣mon
Judgment; I expect to be
sent to some Hermit's Cell, or the
private Oratory of some holy Vo∣taress;
where I may find them, in∣deed,
embody'd; but withal, half-bury'd:
Incomparable Lights, but,
shut up in a kind of dark Lanthorn;
where they burn safely I confess, but
shine to few: while Those I seek,
must be high and conspicuous, to
send forth their Beams and Influ∣ences
over all the VVorld; and in
that regard, Courts are the properest
Firmament for such Illustrious

Stars; and Courts are easily seen,
but where's the Star?
In this perplexity, Madam, it
pleas'd the Goodness of Heaven to
relieve me; for, as the mention of
Courts brought immediately into my
memory the happiness our Nation is
blest with by Your Majesty's Resi∣dence
among us; so the Contempla∣tion
of Your Exemplar Life fill'd
my soul with joy to have found,
at last, those sublime and heroick
Virtues; whose perfect Conformity
to the Rules of Catholick Religion
is, alone, capable to convince the
Certainty of its Truth. Such an
unwearied Constancy in Devo∣tion,
such a degree of Fervor in that
Constancy, cannot possibly pro∣ceed
from a luke-warm Probability

in Faith: such frequent Retire∣ments
to intimate Conversations
with Heaven, such Mortifications,
and contempt of Court-Entertain∣ments,
and (which is yet harder)
such Innocence and Purity amidst
the necessary Admittances of them,
as they all conspire to speak Your
Soul Angelical, so they clearly
prove the vigorous Activity of the
Faith that breeds them, far beyond
the drowsy Indifferency of a pro∣bable
Opinion. Thus, Madam,
while Schollars but discourse, YOV
live Demonstrations. Permit me
then to use, not Your bare Name,
but Your Vertues as a Patronage to
my Endeavours; since the Motive
of this my Dedicatory meant These
for its Substance, and Your Tem∣poral

Supremeness onely for a Cir∣cumstance.
Others Complement
while they dedicate, I Argue all
the while: nor intend I this for a
farther Display of Your Excellent
Vertues (which already are suffici∣ently
manifest to all the VVorld)
but to breed a more serious reflexi∣on
on Them in the minds of those
against whom I write; and other
well-meaning, but mis-led per∣sons.
This advantage Your Majesty
and the Practical Provers of Ca∣tholick
Faith have above us Specu∣laters,
that Your whole Life is a
Continual Argument for It; while
we are bound to expect Seasons
and wait Opportunities: Nor
should I at this time have of∣fer'd

to appear, had not the Mul∣titude
of Books lately Printed a∣gainst
Catholick Religion made it
my plain and necessary Duty with
all my little power to defend It,
VVhat I have endeavour'd, I
most humbly lay at Your Maje∣sties
feet, and remain,
MADAM,
