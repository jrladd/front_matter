My ever honoured Lord:
I Confesse my
charity led me
into an error;
Your Lord∣shippe
well
knowes how
apt I am to be
overtaken with these better de∣ceits
of an over kinde credulitie. I

had thought that any dash of my
pen, in a sudden, and easie adver∣tisement,
might have served to
have quitted that ignorant scan∣dall,
which was cast upon my
mis-taken assertion, of the true vi∣sibility
of the Romane Church.
The issue proves all otherwise:
I finde, to my griefe, that the mis∣understanding
tenacitie of some
zealous spirits hath made it a
quarrell. It cannot but trouble
me to see that the position, which
is so familiarly current with the
best reformed Divines; & which
hath beene so oft and long since
published by mee without con∣tradiction;
yea, not without the
approbation and applause of the
whole representative body of the
Clergie of this kingdome, should

now be quarrelled, and drawne
into the detestation of those that
know it not; As one therefore
that should thinke it corosive
enough, that any occasion should
be taken by ought of mine, to ra∣vell
but one thred of that seamless
coat, I doe earnestly desire, by a
more full explication, to give
cleare satisfaction to all Readers;
and by this seasonable reconcile∣ment,
to stop the flood-gates of
contention; I know it will not be
unpleasing to your Lordship, that
through your honourable and pi∣ous
hands, these welcome papers
should be transmitted to many;
Wherein I shall first beseech, yea
adjure al Christians, under whose
eies they shall fall, by the dreadfull
name of that GOD, who shall

judge both the quicke, and the
dead, to lay aside all unjust preju∣dices;
and to allow the words of
Truth, and Peace; I dare confi∣dently
say, Let us be understood,
and we are agreed.
The searcher of all harts knows
how far it was from my thoughts
to speak ought in favour of the
Roman Synagogue: If I have not
sufficiently branded that Strūpet, I
justly suffer. Luthers broad word is
by me already both safely cōstru∣ed,Ob.
& sufficiently vindicated. But,
doe you not say, It is a true visible
Church? Doe you not yeeld some
kinde of communion with these
clients of Antichrist? What is, if
this be not, favour? Marke well,
Christian Reader, and the Lord
give thee understanding in all

things:Resp. To beginne with the
latter; No man can say but the
Church of Rome holds some
Truths; those truths are Gods,
and in his right, ours, why should
not wee challenge our owne,
wheresoever we finde it? If a ve∣rie
Devill shall say of Christ, Thou
art the Sonne of the living God, wee
will snatch this truth out of his
mouth, as usurped; and in spight
of him, proclaime it for our own.
Indeed; there is no communion
betwixt light and darknesse, but
there is communion betwixt
light and light; Now all truth is
light, and therefore symbolizeth
with it selfe. With that light,
therefore, whose glimmering yet
remaines in their darknesse, our
clearer light will, and must hold

communion; If they professe
three Persons in one Godhead;
two natures in one person of
Christ; shall we detrect to joine
with them in this Christian veri∣tie?
We abhorre to have any com∣munion
with them in their er∣rors,
in their idolatrous or super∣stitious
practices, these are their
owne, not ours. If we durst have
taken their part in these, this
breach had not beene; Now who
can but say that wee must hate
their evill, and allow their good?
It is no countenance to their errors
that we imbrace our owne truths;
It is no disparagement to our
truths, that they have blended
them with their errors: Here can
be no difference, then, if this com∣munion
bee not mis-taken; no

man will say that we may sever
from their common truths; No
man will say that we may joyne
with them in their hatefull er∣rours.
For the former; Hee that saith
a theefe is truly a man, doth hee
therein fauour that theefe? He that
saith, a diseased, dropsied, dying
bodie, is a true (though corrupt)
body, doth he favour that disease,
or that living carcasse? It is no o∣ther,
no more that I say of the
Church of Rome: Truenesse of
being, and outward visibility, are
no praise to her; Yea, these are ag∣gravations
to her falshood: The
advantage that is both sought and
found in this assertion is onely
ours; as we shall see in the sequell,
without any danger of their gain.

I say, then, that she is a true church,
but, I say withall, shee is a false
Church: True in existence, but
false in beleefe: Let not the ho∣monymie
of a word breed jarres,
where the sense is accorded: If
we doe not yeeld her the true be∣ing
of a Church, why do we call
her the Church of Rome? What
speake we of? or where is the sub∣ject
of our question? who sees
not that there is a morall trueness,
and a naturall? He that is moral∣ly
the falsest man, is, in nature, as
truly a man, as the honestest; and
therefore in this regard as true a
man: In the same sense therefore
that wee say the Devill is a true
(though false) spirit; that a cheater
it a true (though false) man, wee
may & must say, that the Church

of Rome is a true (though false)
Church; Certainely, there hath
beene a true errour, and mis-ta∣king
of the sense that is guiltie of
this quarrell. As for the visibility,
there can be no question: Would
God, that Church did not too
much fill our eie, yea the world;
There is nothing wherein it doth
more pride it selfe, than in a glo∣rious
conspicuitie, scorning, in
this regard, the obscure paucitie
of their opposers.
But you say,Ob. What is this but
to play with ambiguities; That
the Church of Rome is it selfe,
that is, a Church; that it is visible;
that it is truly existent, there can
be no doubt; but is it still a part
of the truly existent, visible church
of Christ?Resp. Surely, no otherwise

than an hereticall and Apostaticall
Church is, and may be: Reader,
whosoever thou art, for Gods
sake, for thy soules sake, marke
where thou treadest; Else thou
shalt bee sure to fall either into an
open gulfe of uncharitablenesse,
or into a dangerous precipice of
errour. There is no feare, nor fa∣vour
to say, that the Church of
Rome, under a Christian face,
hath an Antichristian heart; over∣turning
that foundation by neces∣sarie
inferences, which by open
profession in avoweth: That face,
that profession, those avowed
principles are enough to give it
claime to a true outward visibili∣tie
of a Christian Church; whiles
those damnable inferences are e∣nough
to feoffe it in the true style

of heresie, and Antichristianisme;
Now, this heresie, this Antichri∣stianisme
makes Rome justly odi∣ous,
and execrable to God, to An∣gels,
and Men; but cannot utter∣ly
dischurch it, whiles those main
principles maintaine a weake life
in that crazie, and corrupted
bodie.
But is not this language diffe∣rent
from that whereto our eares
and eies have beene inured, from
the mouthes, and pens of some
reverend Divines and professors
of our Church? Know, Reader,
that the streame of the famous
Doctors, both at home, and a∣broad,
hath runne strongly my
way: I should have feared, and
hated to goe alone; what reason
is there then to single out one man

in a throng? Some few worthie
Authors have spoken otherwise,
in the warmth of their zealous
contention; yet so, as that even to
them durst I appeale for my Iud∣ges;
for if their sound differ from
me, their sense agrees with me:
that, which as I touched in my
Advertisement, so I am now rea∣die
to make cleare by the instance
of learned Zanchius; whose preg∣nant
testimonies compared toge∣ther,
shall plainly teach us, how
easie a reconcilement may bee
made betwixt these two, seeming∣ly-contrarie,
opinions: That wor∣thie
Author, in his profession of
Christian Religion, which hee
wrote, and published, in the 70.
yeare of his age, having defined
the Church of Christ in generall,

and passed thorow the properties
of it, at last, descending to the sub∣division
of the Church militant,
comes to inquire, how particular
Churches may be knowne to be
the true churches of Christ, wher∣of
he determines thus. Illas igitur,
&c. Those Churches therefore
doe wee acknowledge for the
true Churches of Christ; in which
first of all, the pure doctrine of the
Gospell is preached, heard, admit∣ted;
and so onely admitted, that
there is neither place, nor eare gi∣ven
to the contrarie: For both
these are the just propertie of the
flocke or sheepe of Christ; name∣ly,
both to heare the voice of their
owne Pastor, and to reject the
voice of strangers. Iohn 10. 4. In
which, secondly, the Sacraments

instituted by Christ, are lawfully,
and (as much as may bee) accor∣ding
to Christs institution, admi∣nistred,
and received; and there∣fore,
in which the Sacraments
devised by men are not admitted,
and allowed; In which lastly, the
discipline of Christ hath the due
place; that is, where both pub∣liquely,
and privately, charitable
care is had, both by admonitions,
corrections, and at last (if need be)
by excommunications, that the
Commandements of God be du∣ly
kept, and that all persons live
soberly, iustly, and piously, to the
glory of God, and edification of
their neighbour. Thus hee;
wherein, who sees not how di∣rectly
he aymes, both at the justi∣fying
of our Churches, and the

casheering of the Roman, which
is palpably guiltie of the violation
of these wholsome rules? And in∣deed,
it must needes be said, if we
bring the Roman Church to this
touch, she is cast for a meer coun∣terfeit;
shee is as farre from truth,
as truth is from falshood: Now
by this time you goe away with
an opinion that learned Zanchie
is my professed adversarie, and
hath directly condemned my po∣sition,
of the truenesse, and visibi∣litie
of the Roman Church: Have
but patience, I beseech you, to read
what the same excellent Author
writes, in his golden Preface to
that noble worke, De natura Dei;
where this question is clearly, &
punctuall decided: There you
shall finde, that having passed

through the wofull and gloomie
offuscations of the Church of
God, in all former ages, he, descen∣ding
to the darknesse of the pre∣sent
Babylon; concludes thus:
Deinde non potuit Satan, &c. More∣over,
Satan could not, in the verie
Roman Church, doe what he li∣sted,
as hee had done in the Ea∣sterne;
to bring all things to such
passe, as that it should no more
have the forme of a Christian
Church; For, in spight of Satan,
that Church retained still the chief
foundations of the faith, although
weakned with the doctrines of
men; it retained the publique prea∣ching
of the word of God, thogh
in many places mis-understood,
and mis-construed; the invocati∣on
of the name of Christ, though

joyned also with the invocation
of dead men; the administration
of Baptisme, instituted by Christ
himselfe, howsoever defiled with
the addition of many superstiti∣ons.
So as, together with the sym∣bole
of the covenant, the Cove∣nant
it selfe remained still in her;
I meane in all the Churches of the
West, no otherwise than it did in
the Church of Israel, even after
that all things were in part profa∣ned
by Ieroboam, and other impi∣ous,
and Idolatrous Kings, upon
the defection made by them from
the Church, and Tribe of Iuda;
For, neither doe I assent to them
which would have the Church
of Rome to have no lesse ceased
to be the Church of Christ, than
those Easterne Churches, which

afterwards turned Mahumetan;
what Church was ever more
corrupt than the Church of the
ten Tribes, yet we learne from the
Scriptures, that it was still the
Church of God? And how doth
S. Paul call that Church, where∣in
Antichrist (hee saith) shall sit,
the Temple of God? neither is it
any Baptisme at all, that is admini∣stred
out of the Church of Christ.
The wife that is an Adulteresse,
doth not cease to be a wife, unlesse
being despoiled of her mariage-ring,
she be manifestly divorced:
The Church of Rome, therefore,
is yet the Church of Christ; but
what manner of Church? Surely
so corrupted and depraved, and
with so great tyrannie oppressed,
that you can neither, with a good

conscience, partake with them, in
their holy things, nor safely dwell
amongst them. Thus he againe;
Wherein you see hee speakes as
home for me, as I could devise to
speake for my selfe: and as appo∣sitely
professeth to oppose the
contrarie.
Looke, now how this learned
Author may be reconciled to his
owne pen; and by the very same
way, shall my pen bee reconciled
with others: Either he agrees not
with himselfe, or else, in his sense,
I agree with my gainsayers: No∣thing
is more plaine, then that hee
in that former speech, and all o∣ther
classicke Authors, that speake
in that Key, meane, by a True
Church, a sound, pure, right belee∣ving
Church; so as their vera is

rather verax:Ibid. prae∣fat. de nat. Dei. Zanchie explicates
the terme, whiles he joines veram
& puram together; so as in this
construction it is no true Church
that is an unsound one; as if truth
of existence were all one with
truth of doctrine: In this sense,
whosoever shall say the Church
of Rome is a true Church, I say he
calls evill good, and is no better
than a teacher of lyes. But, if we
measure the true being of a visible
Church, by the direct mainte∣nance
of fundamentall principles,
though by consequences indirect∣ly
overturned, and by the possessi∣on
of the word of God, and his
Sacraments, though not without
soule adulteration; what judici∣ous
Christian can but, with mee,
subscribe to learned Zanchius, that

the Church of Rome hath yet the
true visibilitie of a Church of
Christ: what should I need to
press the latitude, and multiplicity
of sense of the word, Church;
there is no one term that I know,
in all use of speech, so various; If,
in a large sense, it be taken to com∣prehend
the society of all that pro∣fesse
Christian Religion, through
the whole world, howsoever im∣pured,
who can denie this title to
the Roman? If, in a strict sense, it
be taken (as it is by Zanchius here,
and all those Divines who refuse
to give this style to the Synagogue
of Rome) for the companie of e∣lect
faithfull men gathered into
one mysticall bodie under one
head, Christ, washed by his blood;
justified by his merits, sanctified

by his Spirit, conscionablie wait∣ing
upon the true ordinances of
God, in his pure Word, and holie
Sacramēts▪ who can be so shame∣lesse,
as to give this title to the Ro∣man
Church? Both these senten∣ces,
then, are equally true; The
Church of Rome is yet a true Church
in the first sense; The Church of Rome
long since ceased to bee a true Church
in the second. As those friendly soul∣diers
therefore, of old, said to their
fellowes (?) why fight
we? Stay, stay, deare brethren, for
Gods sake, for his Churches sake,
for your soules sake, stay these bu∣sie
and unprofitable litigations;
put up, on both sides, your angrie
pens; Turne your Swords into
Sithes, to cut downe the ranke
corruptiōs of the Roman church;

and your Speares into Mattockes,
to beat downe the walls of this
mysticall Babylon; There are ene∣mies
now abroad, Let us bee
friends at home; But if your sense
be the same, you will aske, why
our termes varie, and why wee
have chosen to fall upon that ma∣ner
of expression, which gives ad∣uantage
to the Adversarie, offence
to our owne? Christian Reader,
let me beseech thee, in the bowels
of Christ, to weigh well this mat∣ter,
and then tell me why such of∣fence,
such advantage should bee
rather given by my words, than
by the same words, in the mouth
of Luther, of Calvin, of Zanchie, Iu∣nius,
Plessee, Hooker, Andrewes,
Field, Crakenthorpe, Bedel, and that
whole cloud of learned and pi∣ous

Authors, who have, without
exceptiō, used the same language?
And why more by my words,
now, than twentie yeares agoe, at
which time I published the same
truth, in a more ful and liberall ex∣pression.
Wise and charitable
Christians may not be apt to take
offence where none is given. As
for anie Advantage that is hereby
given to the Adversaries, they
may put it in their eye, and see ne∣ver
the worse. Loe; say they,
we are of the true visible Church;
this is enough for us; why are we
forsaken, why are we presecuted,
why are we solicited to change?
Alas, poore soules, doe they not
know, that Hypocrites, leud per∣sons,
reprobates, are no lesse mem∣bers
of the true visible Church?

what gaine they by this but a dee∣per
damnation? To what pur∣pose
did the Iewes crie, The Tem∣ple
of the Lord, whiles they despigh∣ted
the Lord of that Temple? Is
the sea-weed ever the lesse vile, be∣cause
it is dragd vp together with
good fish? They are of the visible
Church, such as it is; what is this
but to say, they are neither Iewes,
nor Turkes, nor Pagans; but mis∣beleevers,
damnablie hereticall in
opinion, shamefullie idolatrous
in practice; Let them make their
best of this just Elogie; and tri∣umph
in this style, may we never
prosper if we envie them this glo∣rie:
Our care shall be, that, besides
the Church sensible,Epist. l. 2. resp. ad Ca∣tabaptist. (as Zuinglius
distinguisheth) we may be of the
Church spirituall; and not resting

in a fruitlesse visibilitie, wee may
finde our selves livelie limbes of
the mystical body of Christ; which
onelie condition shall give us a
true right to heaven; whiles fa∣shionable
profession, in vaine
cries, Lord, Lord, and is barred out
of those blessed gates, with an, I
know you not.
Neither may the Reader think,
that I affect to goe by-waies of
speech: no, I had not taken this
path, unlesse I had found it both
more beaten, and fairer: I am not
so unwise, to teach the Adversarie
what disadvantage I conceive to
be given to our most just cause, by
the other manner of explication.
Let it suffice to say, that this form
of defence more fully stops the ad∣versaries
mouth in those two

maine and envious scandals,
which hee casts upon our holy
Religion, Defection from the
Church, and Innovation; than
which, no suggestion hath wont
to bee more prevalent with
weake, and ungrounded hearts,
what wee further win by this,
not more charitable, than safe
Tenet, I had rather it should bee
silently conceived by the judi∣cious,
then blazoned by my
free penne; shortly, in this state
of the question, our gaine is as
cleare, as the Adversaries losse:
our ancient Truth triumphes
over their upstart errours, our
charitie over their mercilesse pre∣sumptions;
Feare not therefore,
deare brethren, where there is
on roome for danger; Suspect

not fraud where there is nothing
but plaine, honest, simplicitie of
intentions; censure not where
there is the same Truth, clad in a
different, but more easie habite
of words; But if any mans fervent
zeale shall rather draw him to the
liking of that other, rougher, and
harder way, so as in the meane
time he keepe within the bounds
of Christian charitie, I taxe him
not; let everie man abound in
his owne sense; Onely let our
hearts, and tongues, and hands,
conspire together in peace with
our selves, in warre with our
common enemies.
Thus farre have I (Right Ho∣nourable)
in a desire of peace,
poured out my selfe into a plaine
explication, and easie accordance:

Those whom I strive to satisfie,
are onely mis-takers; whose cen∣sures,
if some man would have
either laught out, or despised, yet
I have condescended to take off
by a serious deprecation, and
just defence.
It is an vnreasonable motion
to request mindes prepossessed
with prejudice to heare reason;
Whole Volumes are nothing to
such as have contented them∣selves
onely to take up opinions
upon trust, and will hold them,
because they know where they
had them: In vaine should I spend
my selfe in beating upon such an∣viles;
but for those ingenuous
Christians, which will hold an
eare open for justice, and truth, I
have said enough, if ought at all
needed.

Alas, my Lord, I see and grieve
to see it; it is my Rochet that hath
offended, and not I; In another
habit, I, long since, published this,
and more, without dislike; It is
this colour of innocence that hath
bleared some over-tender eyes;
Wherein I know not whether I
should more pittie their errour,
or applaud my owne sufferings;
although I may not say with the
Psalmist, What hath the righteous
done? Let mee (I beseech your
Lordship) upon this occasion,
have leave to give a little vent to
my just griefe in this point.
The other day I fell upon a
Latine Pamphlet, homely for
style, tedious for length, zealous∣ly
uncharitable for stuffe, where∣in
the Author (onely wise in this,

that he would bee unknowne)
in a grave fiercenesse flies in the
face of our English Prelacie; not
so much enveighing against their
Persons, (which he could be con∣tent
to reverence) as their verie
places. I blest my selfe to see the
case so altered: Heretofore, the
Person had wont to beare off
manie blowes from the function;
now the verie function wounds
the person: In what case are we,
when that which should com∣mand
respect, brands us? What
blacke Art hath raised up this
spirit of Aerius from his pit? Wo
is mee, that zeale should breed
such monsters of conceit: It is
the honour, the Pompe, the
wealthe, the pleasure (hee saith) of
the Episcopall Chaire that is guil∣tie

of the depravation of our Cal∣ling;
and if himselfe were so over∣layd
with greatnesse, hee should
suspect his owne fidelitie. Alas,
poore man, at what distance doth
hee see us? Foggie Ayre useth to
represent everie object farre big∣ger
than it is. Our Sauiour in his
temptation upon the Mount,
had onely the glorie of those
Kingdomes showed to him, by
that subtile Spirit, not the cares,
and vexations; Right so are our
dignities exhibited to these envi∣ous
beholders; Little doe these
men see the toyles, and anxieties
that attend this supposedly-plea∣sing
eminence.
All the revenge that I would
wish to this uncharitable Cen∣surer,
should bee this, that hee

might bee but for a while adjudg∣ed
to this so glorious seate of
mine; that so his experience might
taste the bewitching pleasures of
this envied greatnesse; hee should
well finde more danger of being
over-spent with worke, than of
languishing with ease & delicacie.
For mee I need not appeale to
Heaven: Eyes enow can witnesse
how few free houres I have en∣joyed,
since I put on these Robes
of sacred honour. In so much as
I could finde in my heart, with
holy Gregorie, to complaine of my
change; were it not, that I see these
publique troubles are so many
acceptable services to my God,
whose glorie is the end of my
being: Certainly, my Lord, if
none but earthly respects should

sway me, I should heartily wish
to change this Pallace (which the
Providence of God, and the
bountie of my gracious Sove∣raigne
hath put mee into) for my
quiet Cell at Waltham, where I
had so sweet leasure to enjoy
God, your Lordship, and my selfe:
But I have followed the calling of
my God, to whose service I am
willingly sacrificed; and must
now, in an holy obedience to his
Divine Majestie, with what
cheerefulnesse I may, ride out all
the stormes of envie, which una∣voidably
will alight vpon the
least appearance of a conceived
greatnesse; in the meane time,
what ever I may seeme to others,
I was never lesse in my owne ap∣prehensions;
and, were it not for

this attendance of envie, could
not yeeld my selfe any whit grea∣ter
than I was; what ever I am,
that good God of mine, make
mee faithfull to him; and com∣pose
the unquiet spirits of men, to
a conscionable care of the pub∣lique
peace; with which prayer,
together with the apprecation of
all happinesse to your Lordship,
and all yours, I take leave and am
