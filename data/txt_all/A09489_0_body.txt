Right Honourable,
IT may seeme strange vnto
some, that J be∣ing no professed Diuine; should presume to pre∣sent vnto the viewe and ver∣dict of curious Censurers, a Treatise of prai∣ers; It being a subiect fittest for deepe grounded Divines to deale
withall. And as∣much, that J should Dedicate these my Medi∣ations vnto your Lordship. For the first, my ex∣cuse is, that I offer them not for instruction of the iudicious, but for the vse of them that are as
weake in Iudge∣ment, as I am, and to others of meaner capaci∣tie, if any such there bee. For my addresse of them to your Honour, J haue no other excuse, or defence, but that which is best knowne vn∣to
your Honor, to whom I am more obliged, then my weake Abilities can giue hopes to yeelde other re∣compence, then by Prayer vnto God, that your proceedings may prosper by pietie, and be rewarded
with eternall fe∣licitie.
