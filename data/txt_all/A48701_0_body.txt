My LORD,
WIsdom is the Founda∣tion of Justice and Equity, and it
seems not to be perfect, without it com∣prehends also
Philosophy and Natural Learning, and what∣ever is of good Relish in Arts.
It is certain, my Lord, for the Honour of your high Station, that the
greatest Philosophers of this Age, were of your Prede∣cessors; nor is
your Lordship in any thing behind them; as tho nothing inspired People with
more Equity, than a true value for Ʋseful Learning and Arts. This hath
given me the boldness to offer your Lordship this short Account, of the
Magnificent and Noble City of Paris, and the Court of that great King,
who hath given Europe so long and vehement Disquiet, and cost
England in particular so much Blood and Treasure. 'Tis
pos∣sible, my Lord, you may find a leisure Hour to read over these few
Papers for your Diversion, wherein I promise my self, you will meet with
nothing Offensive, but clean Matter of Fact, and some short Notes of an
unpreju∣diced Observer. But that I may no longer importune you, perpe∣tually
busied in so laborious and useful an Imployment, I beg leave to
subscribe my self,
My LORD,
