Honoured Sir,
WHat You have so often fought for, and the Church of England has so long pray'd for, it has pleased the great
King of Kings in Mercy at last to bring to pass, the discovery, and thereby, the dis∣appointment of the Enemies of this Church and State. For which as we are all bound to render our unfeigned Thanks to the Almighty, (who alone gives Victory to Kings, and has once more preserved our Royal David from the hands of Blood∣thirsty and deceitful Men.) So have none more reason to rejoyce before the Lord, than those that serve at his Altar, and were designed to be Sacrificed upon it. And among those, none more than your poor Servant, whose unfeigned (though useless) Loyalty has been so long coun∣ted his Crime, that it can scarce yet render him acceptable to those men, who say to the Ministers of the Gospel,
as the Rebellious Jews did to the Prophets of old; Speak unto us smooth things, Prophecy deceits; Get you out of the way; turn aside out of the path: cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from us. But blessed be God, who has preserved the Clergy of the Church of England from the Super∣stition of Popery, and the Atheistcal Hipocrisy of Fanaticism. To both which, as the whole World can witness your Loyal and Zealous Aversion; so am I bound in Gratitude to acknow∣ledge the great Encouragements I have always received from your Generous Bounty in that narrow Sphere, where∣in I move; For which I can onely offer up my Prayers to the Great God of
Recompences; That be would still con∣tinue you in that true Religion, which you have received from so many Noble, so many Honourable Ancestors, in the deserved Favour of the best of Princes, and the best Judge of Worthy Per∣sons, and in the due Respect and Ho∣nour of all Loyal Men, among whom be pleas'd to admit of the most humble, most gratefull Acknowledgments of,
Sir,
