My Lord, and you, my Lords, the Judges,
BE pleased to give me leave to acquaint your Lordships, that I
have not presum'd to pre∣sent this small Tractate under so noble a Patro∣nage, out of any worth I conceiv it can draw from the Author, but onely what it takes from the nobleness of the Subject, being the Profession of Physick, a Profession of late struck at by many Writers, who have not made themselves in any thing more famous then in their bold Calumnies against those Rules and
Method, which more learned men then them∣selves have for many Ages thought fit to re∣commend unto Posteri∣ty. Neither have they rested here, but endea∣voured to draw His most Gracious Majesty's con∣currence to their under∣takings, and by that dan∣gerous way of innova∣ting through subscripti∣ons of Hands, laboured to erect a new Society of Chymical Physicians in
London, in opposition to that Body already setled.
'Tis certainly high time to fly to your Lord∣ships for protection, whose wisedom is dis∣cerning enough, and in∣tegrity always awake to do justice to our poor College, especially when His Majesty's Name is like to be traduced, their Liberties granted by His Charters, and confirmed by Acts of Parliament, in
danger to be infringed, by introducing a Liber∣ty in practising Physick by every one shall pre∣tend himself able in that Faculty.
I shall humbly cast my self and what I have written at your Lord∣ships feet, being in no∣thing more ambitious then by any act of mine to express the great Ho∣nour I have for all of your learned Profession,
and the service I shall ever readily pay to your Persons, who am,
My Lords,
