Right Honorable,
ALL that J can say for my selfe, is a desire of doing good; which if it were as feruent in ri∣cher hearts, the Church which now we see come∣ly, would then be glorious: this honest ambition hath caried mee to neglect the feare of seeming prodigall of my little; and while J see others Talents rusting in the earth, hath drawne mee to traffique with mine in publike. I hope, no aduenture that euer I made of this kinde, shall be equally gainfull to this my present labour, wherein I take Gods owne Hi∣storie for the ground, and worke vpon it by what Meditations my weaknesse can afford: The diuinenesse of this subiect shall make more then amends for the manifold defects of my discourse; al∣though also the blame of an imperfection is so much the more, when it lighteth vpon so high a choice. This part which I offer to your Lordship, shall shew you Pharaoh impotently enuious and cruell, the Israelites of friends become slaues, punished onely for prospe∣ring; Moses in the Weedes, in the Court, in the Desart, in the
 Hill of visions; a Courtier in Aegypt, a Shepheard in Midian, an Ambassador from God, a Leader of Gods people: and when you see the prodigious varietie of the plagues of Aegypt, you shall not know whether more to wonder at the miracles of Moses, or Pharaohs obstinacle. Finally, you shall see the same Waues made both a wall and a gulfe in one houre; the Aegyptians drowned, where no Jsraelite was wet-shod: and if these passages, yeeld not abundance of profitable thoughts, impute it (not without pardon) to the pouertie of my weake conceit; which yet may perhaps occa∣sion better vnto others. Jn all humble submission J commend them (what they are) to your Lordships fauourable acceptation, and your selfe with them to the gracious blessing of our God.
