HAuing for many yeeres to∣gether bin an eye-witnesse of your great care, in proui∣ding all manner of neces∣saries both for the bodies and soules of those men that you haue sent and im∣ployed in your seuerall fleets into the East-Indies: I haue longed to ex∣presse my loue for many fauours receiued from you; but had no other meanes, but by adding to your great prouisions for the Sea, these Medita∣tions following, fitted especiallie for Sea-men. A worke wherein I know not any man that hath gone before me, and therefore I hope the better to be accepted: In which I haue onely broken the

ye, and giuen the onset, to encourage some more skillfull workeman to vndertake it in some better fashion; seeing there is such varietie and plentie of heauenly meditations in this argument, as in no other particular that I know of: And yet a∣mongst the great multiplicitie of learned workes in all other matters, this only hath bin neglected, and not thought of. The substance of these Me∣ditations were purposed to haue been Preached at the setting forth of your last fleete, aboard the ROYALL IAMES, as a farewell-Sermon (as I had diuers times before, vpon the like occasions, done the like office). But God then otherwise dispo∣sing of it: As our law condemneth malefactors that speake not for themselues, to be pressed to death; so I contrariewise haue thought fit, to presse this benefactor to Sea-men (as I hope) to a further life: that the things that then escaped the eares of a few, may now bee in the eyes and sight of all that please; and may not onely bee a meanes to them to beguile some idle howres, but teach them in all places of the world, to make spirituall vse to their soules, of all occurrences that either by Sea or Land they shall meete withall. The great blessings of Almightie God vpon our little Iland; since the shaking off the superstitious Idolatrie of the Church of Rome, and the sincere Preaching of the true Catholike Faith amongst vs; as they appeare in the vniting of the two King∣domes of England and Scotland, and the vniting of the hearts of both the peoples, hauing One

Lord, One Faith, One Baptisme, One God and Father of all: So by your meanes and Christian care, in the sending forth of your great Fleetes vnto the furthest parts of the earth, Our Faith is published thoròugh the World; and our Land made famous vnto the remotest parts thereof: And yee cannot but thankefully remember and acknowledge, to the honour of our great God, how hee hath poured out his blessings more a∣boundantly vpon your Fleets, then vpon any of our bordering neighbours. I humbly beseech him not onely to continue, but to increase and multiplie his goodnesse and mercy euery day more and more toward vs, maugre the malice of all our enemies. I know that some secretly (through enuie) doe repine and murmur at your prosperous successe: and some haue publikely in Print taxed and traduced your Trading, laying foule and scandalous imputations and aspersions vpon it, as preiudiciall to the State and Com∣mon-wealth: and it were easie for me to shew the ridiculous vntruth of those cauils which they ob∣iect: but that I am therein preuented both by a worthy Knight in his defence of Trade,Sir Dudley Diggs. as also by a reuerend Diuine in his holy Pilgrimage;Mr. Purchas. vnto whose writings I referre them that desire satis∣faction. I must needs set downe what I know and see daily, of your great bountie and liberalitie, to the honour of God, and your further encou∣ragement to doe good: viz. that as God hath greatly encreased your store, so yee haue not been

backward to impart much, and more then any o∣ther Societie (that euer I could heare of) to the supplie of the wants of his poore members: your dailie reliefe of poore Ministers of the Gospell, your charitie to Prisoners, to Widowes, to Or∣phans, and to all well minded poore people that you find to stand in neede of your helpe, cannot but pleade for you in the eyes of God and all good men.
Goe on therefore (in Gods name) in your noble designes, and rest ye still vpon his blessing, who (I doubt not) hath many more in store for you, and so long as you conscionably seeke to honour his name among the Heathen, and (vn∣der him) to aduance the State wherein yee liue; will (no doubt) affoord you many comfortable assurances of his loue and fauour, both to your bodies and soules here in this life, and crowne you with eternall glorie with himselfe, in the life to come. And thus recommending your selues, your ships, your men, your goods both abroade and at home to Gods blessed protection; with my dailie Prayers to God for you all, and more speci∣ally for that Fleete which is now shortly to be set forth, I beseech you kindely to accept of this little Newyeeres gift, and I shall be bound to rest
