RIght Reuerend and my verie good Lords, I am bold, out of that duetie I owe to two so great Pre∣lats and pillars of this our Church of England, to present vnto your learned and judicious censures, my vnlearned and simple labours, bestowed vpon a worke worthie the reading in it selfe, howsoe∣uer by my vnskilfull pen it may be disfigured. I confesse I was vnfit∣ting, amongst a thousand, to vndertake a worke of such conse∣quence, and yet better I (as I thought) than none, being a Mysterie fit to be layd open to as many as can read it in their mother tongue. My good Lords, pardon such faults as either by too much speed, or too little skill, or otherwise, haue slipt my pen: There is nothing past that may not be amended in a second edition, if your Grace shall be pleased to giue the encouragement. The God of heauen, as he hath multiplied his gifts and graces vpon you, fit for so high a calling, euen in the highest measure, so euer assist you with his holie spirit, in that great worke you haue vndertaken, to his glorie, and the good of his Church.
