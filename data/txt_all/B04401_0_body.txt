MADAM,
YOUR long and great Experience of the pleasures and sweetness's of Religion, hath made it so dear and precious to you, that whate∣er you conceive can have any Tendencies to e Advancement and Propagation of it in a egenerat World, you are inclined highly to alue. It was your Charitable Apprehension at the following Performance, in the Cir∣mstances wherewith it was attended, and  reason of the Account it gives, might have me influence this way, at lest among those hom it did more particularly concern, that
 prompted you to plead for the Publication of it. The Piety and goodness of the motion of being serviceable to the World, I did ex∣ceedingly relish; but I was so sensible of the defectiveness, and unaccuracy of my Medita∣tions, that I could not think of allowing them to face the Publick without a Blush. The Circumstances in which I was, when obliged to have these Reflections, and my frequent interruptions since (with which your Lady∣ship was not altogether unacquainted) will, I know, be a sufficient Apology to you, for all the imperfections that will appear in them, especially when this consideration is added that great and elaborat performances, can∣not be justly expected from one of so little experience, and so mean capacity, as, with∣out any great Self-denyal, I must acknow∣ledge my self to be: And if this will no procure the favourable Constructions of o¦thers, I shall give them leave, if they thin it worth their while to pass Censures. How¦ever, if what I have done be of any efficacy to beget a pious Inclination, or a good Re¦solution in the Hearts of any that shall giv themselves the trouble of a Perusal, yo have got the design you aimed at, and shall think my self very sufficiently rewarde
 though more of my time and pains had been expended.
The worthy Person, of whose Funeral So∣lemnities, the ensuing Discourse, made a∣part, you was used to admit into great and (while he was alive, he would himself mo∣destly add) very undeserved degrees of your Favour and Esteem: And indeed, your Respects to him have not died with him: You was deeply sensible, how sad a Presage, and how great a Disadvantage, the removeal of a gracious and useful Soul out of the World is; and therefore you heartily wished, and chearfully contribut∣ed your loving Endeavours, that his Life should be lengthned; but when that could not be, you was content to take occasi∣on to put Respects upon his Memory; and therefore you often times testified, with a deal of pious Affection and Concern, how well he deserved to be had in everlasting remembrance; And the sense you had of his singular subserviency, for advancing the great design of Religion, did draw that kind Expression from you, when he was in his Grave, that now a great Light was laid in Darkness.
How tenderly you endeavoured to wipe
 off the Tears from the Eyes of his mourn∣ful Relations, by the influences of your Cha∣rities, it would, I know, be an incroach∣ment on your Modesty, to make a pub∣lick declaration of it, though it were but a doing Justice to the World, to set so lau∣dable and imitable a Pattern of Goodness be∣fore it. You have been long and well Train∣ed up in the School of Afflictions: Your continued experience of a distressed State, hath acquainted you with the Temptati∣ons and necessities that attend it, and makes you to melt and dissolve in Mercies and Compassions, towards all whom you see in it, and hath furnished you with a Maga∣zine of suitable Consolations, and Directi∣ons to Relieve under it; out of this pro∣ceeded that excellent Sentence, wherewith you did alleviat and ease the Griefs of your deceased Friends, disconsolat Relict, which was to this purpose, that we should not fol∣low our dead Relations to the Grave, for this will nourish and foment our Sorrows, But to Heaven, where they are made perfect and hap∣py; and this can not choose but silence our immoderat Regrates for them.
Madam, The reason why I prefix your Name to these Papers, is not to honour you,
 but to adorn them. The pious design that was proposed in the Publication of them, can not be attained, you know, if they be not Read; and to oblige to do this, it will be inducement great enough to see your worthy Name in the entry: For all that know you, will reasonably conclude, that certainly some excellent thing must needs follow so Noble and Glorious an Introduction. 'Tis true, I am sensible they meet with a signal disap∣pointment. However, I think the time that is spent in perusing these few Leaves, may haply be worse imployed.
I shall not trouble you any further, on∣ly suffer me heartily to wish, that, for the benefit of the World, which stands greatly indebted to your large and universal Chari∣ty, for the interest of Religion, to which much Honour, and many Advantages re∣dound from your Christian and Examplary Conversation, for the sake of the Ministry, which, wherever you are, you signally en∣courage and respect, and for the comfort and satisfaction of your Relations, who can not enough value the happiness they have, in be∣ing interressed in your dayly and fervent Prayers, your Life may be long and prospe∣rous, your Consolations aboundant, your
 Piety persevere and flourish, and bring forth Fruit in your old age. So prays,
Madam
