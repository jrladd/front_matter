THere hath been presen∣ted unto us, a Remon∣strance of the deplora∣ble estate of this Church of Ireland, and the la∣mentable Condition of the Clergy therein, occasioned by the present Rebellion; The Remonstrants de∣siring our Letters in the Represen∣ting of the same to the honourable House of Commons in England; unto whose grave and wise conside∣ration they do apply themselves.

We shall not need to say much in a matter, so much speaking it self, and the experience we have of the true sence they have of this distract∣ed State, gives us great assurance, that they will take to heart this our mise∣rable Church, and Gods servants therein, reduced unto unexpressable extremities, both Church and State being now involved in one common calamity.
The bearer hereof, Henry Jones, Doctor in Divinity, is intrusted by the Clergy to negotiate in their be∣half, and we have intreated him to solicite the cause of the poor robbed English, expressed in our Letters to you of the fourth of this moneth.
We therefore do crave leave to recommend him in this imploy∣ment to that Honourable House, he

being a Person who is able to say much in this businesse, having been some while a Prisoner in the hands of the Rebels, and observed much of their proceedings, and being in∣trusted with others, as a Commissi∣oner to take the examinations out of which the Remonstrance now to be by him offered to that Honourable House, is extracted.
As for himself, he hath suffered much in his private fortunes by these troubles, and in respect of his Abi∣lities and Learning, and Painfulnesse in his Ministry, he deserveth favour and encouragement; Besides we have found him very diligent, and for∣ward in attending all occasions, for promoting the publike services here by timely and important intelli∣gence given to us of Occurences, du∣ring

his imprisonment with the Re∣bels; and since especially in his in∣formation made to us of the approa∣ches of the enemy to Drogheda, when we could not conceive they would rise to that boldnesse, by which in∣formation (amongst others) we had the opportunity of sending thither the present Garrison, without whom it might have been in danger of sur∣prising; And so we remain from His Majesties Castle of Dublin the seventh day of March, 1641.
