GEntlemen, looke not heere to finde anie
sprigs of Pallas bay tree, nor to heare the
humour of any amorous Lawreat, nor the
pleasing vaine of any eloquent Orator:
Nolo altum sapere, they bee matters aboue
my capacitie: the Coblers checke shal ne∣uer
light on my heade, Ne sutor vltra crepi∣dam,
I vil go no further than the latchet, and then all is wel.
Heere you may perhaps finde some leaues of Venus mirtle,
but heven down by a souldier with his curtlaxe, not boght
with tle allurement of a filed tongue. To bee briefe Gen∣tlemen,
roome for a souldier and a sailer, that giues you the
fruits of his labors that he wrote in the Ocean, when euerie
line was wet with a surge, & euery humorous passion coun∣tercheckt
with a storme. If you like it, so: and yet I will bee
yours in duetie, if you be mine in fauour. But if Momus or
any squinteied asse, that hath mighty eares to conceiue with
Midis, and yet little reason to iudge: if he come abord our
Barke to find fault with the tackling, when hee knowes not
the shrowds, Ile downe into the hold, and fetch out a rustie
pollax, that sawe no sunne this seauen yeare, and either well
bebast him, or heaue the cockescombe ouer boord to feed
cods. But curteous Gentlemen that fauour most, backbite
, and pardon what is ouerslipt, let such come and wel∣come,
Ile into the Stewards roome, and fetch them a kanne
of our best beuradge. Well Gentlemen, you haue Euphues
Lgacie. I fetcht it as farre as the Ilands of Terceras, & ther∣fore
read it, censure with fauour, and farewell.
