THE Universal Admiration Your Ladyship has ob∣tained in the World, hav∣ing
inspired a young Prince with a Curiosity to see so many Wonders as Fame does Your Ladyship the Ju∣stice to relate, He is come from beyond Sea with hopes not only of having leave to satisfie the Ambition He has of paying Homage to so many Excellencies, but
likewise, if you can think fit, Madam, to allow Him a favourable Audience, He does not question but to make appear, that his Mis∣fortunes are of such a Na∣ture as both to merit and engage Your Ladyships Pi∣ty and Protection. Both His Commission and Pass∣port
to Your Ladyship have something in them so extra∣ordinary, that as One has wherewith to raise Compas∣sion, so the Other has to create Veneration in all People. For He is ad∣dressed, Madam, to a La∣dy whose Family has ever, and is still at this day
fruitful in Hero's, and who has likewise the advan∣tage of being united to One that has filled the Chroni∣cles of all Ages with its Extraordinary Performan∣ces, and miraculous Instan∣ces of a Constant Loyalty, wherein they have been so zealously followed by the
present Earl, that the Best of Subjects and Greatest of Men may be proud of imi∣tating his Conduct and A∣ctions: Yet, notwithstand∣ing all these Invitations, this Prince does acknow∣ledge that he was incited to this Address more by Your Ladyships own Merit
and Lustre, than all these Advantages of Extraction and Alliance: It was a Beauty, Madam, above de∣scription, a Wit beyond all imagination, and these at∣tended by a benign Disposi∣tion, an Affability, a Good∣ness, and all and none but those Qualities which pro∣cure
Respect and Acclama∣tion, that made him ambi∣tious of laying himself at Your Ladyships Feet, and to beg leave to declare the Devotion with which I am, Madam,
