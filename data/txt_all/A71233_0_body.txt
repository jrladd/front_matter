Christian and endeared Friends,
VPon that Edict of the first of January 1655. pro∣hibiting Sequestred and Ejected Ministers from Pulpit, and all other imployments (though I verily beleeve, that his Highnesse and Councill chiefly aymed at the muzling of the Mouthes of such turbulent Spirits, and Martiall Ministers, as are no sooner claspt in their Pulpits, but presently Proclaym War, in stead of Preaching Peace; Sedition, in stead of Obedience; and Confusion in stead of Order; without the least intent of prejudice to such as were quiet and peaceable in Israel; and not hearing as yet of any limitation) being (amongst many others) by force thereof, not onely disused from officiating in Publick, but likewise de∣barred of all wayes and means, through which, by my costly Education, I might have procured some reasonable compe∣tency for my selfe, and the many depending wholly upon me; I have had leisure enough to bewayle both mine own and others miseries. And after not a few melancholy Cogitati∣ons, finding my selfe an Achan, a great troubler of this poor Church and People; and seeing mine, as much (if not far more) then others sins to be the onely cause of all our woes; I set my selfe to find out some Remedy for distressed
Englands Malady: Hereupon I sometimes Mournfully, yet willingly, sate downe by the Banks of Babylon, there making Sorrow my Soules Solace, finding indeed no greater joy in my heavinesse, then in Sorrow for sin: Sometimes I walked abroad into the pleasant Meadows, greene Fields, and fresh Pastures of holy Scriptures, there to seek and sinde some soure Hearbes, and of the tartest relish, and some Flowers of the darkest hew, and strongest scent, that their sad complexion might best please the weeping Eyes of a pensive Heart, and their bitter smell might best affect the distasted Pallat of a sin sick-sorrowfull Soule. Of both which sorts, I found the Psalmes, Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, Neho∣miah, and the Lamentaions of Jeremy well stored, and thick Planted; and gathering some of them, such as I thought for my purpose. I then took a turne into the delightsome Gardens of holy Writ, to seek out some sweet flowers of com∣fort; and finding plenty, I cropt some few, to mix with the other, that the ones sweetnesse, might something alay the others tartnesse. And though thus full furnisht, yet distrusting my own Skill and Judgement in so great a Cure of such a dangerous and deadly Disease; I went to View the Receipts of far more Able, Wise, and Learned spirituall Physitians, and from them extracted the best directions; which together, with my own weake Meditations, I mixt with all the other In∣gredients; and having first washed them well in the waters of Marah, have of all these severals or simples, made up such a Compound, as I hope will be a good Preservative against the Infectious poyson of sin, and a good Salve for Englands present Sore. And upon some thoughts, that if this Medicine were good for my selfe, it might, by Gods blessing, be comfortable to others also: Considering also, that a Book perhaps may speake, when an Author may not; not
harbouring the least thoughts of Vain-glory, or Popular Ap∣plause; I resolved with my selfe to make my Meditations Publick, like our Sorrows. And not knowing how to doe it any other way, I took this occasion of manifesting my dearest affections, and best wishes, to you, amongst whom I had my first Breathing, and have lived so long, as that none, better then your selves, are able to give evidence both of my former con∣versation, and present condition. It may be (meane and plain as it is) it may conduce to the benefit of many; but my prin∣cipall intent in it, was the zeale I have to your Soules, the salvation of which, I shall ever most heartily pray for. Accept therefore I beseech you of these my poor Endeavours, and make use of this Physick I have prepared for you: But give me leave to give you some Directions in the taking of it; You must Chew it, Swallow it, and Digest it, not throwing it up so soon as you have received it, for then it will doe you no good; but if you can keep it in the Stomack of your Souls, you will find it to be such a Violent Purge, and working Vomit, as will force you to Cast or Spue up all the Poyson of Sin. If you think it be toe much to swallowow all at once, you may divide it, at you please, into severall Potions; yet, I think, the whole will be but three easie Mornings Draughts for your Soules; however, leave it not in the halfe, though you take longer time to Drink and Digest it all, and then I doubt not, but as it bath been to me, so it may be to you that takes it, somewhat usefull and helpfull; And if any of you find ease, or get help by this Publick Sorrow, the onely Phy∣sick for a sin burthened Soule; then Prayse God, and Pray for,
