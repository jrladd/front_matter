I AM BOLD, RIGHT Honorable, to present this booke vnto you & to craue your fauora∣ble patronage therein, bicause there are many reasons which mooue me so to do. First, the subiect matter of the booke, which is your selfe especially, and the rest of the leaders, vnder whose happie conduction hir Maiesties nauie preuailed against the Spanish fleete. Second∣ly,
 the time, which I haue spent in the grauing of the seueral Tables belonging to the booke, whereby the reader shall haue not onely the report, but the sight as it were of what notable thing soeuer was performed by your Honor in that high and honorable seruice. Thirdly, the booke it selfe, which as it hath beene kept backe these two yeeres almost from our men in an vnknowen toong, so (as I gesse) it had lien hid for euer, had not the good foreseene giuen iust occasion of the publishing thereof. Last of all, the time it selfe doth mooue to that which I haue done, which being the beginning of the new yeer, calleth for by custome a NEW YEERES GIFT, that is, as I construe it, a signe as abilitie permitteth, of that dutiful thankful∣nes, which I acknowledge my selfe to owe vn∣to your Honor. The which my thankfulnes, bicause I had none other more conuenient signe, I was inforced to shew in presenting you this booke. Forsomuch therefore as it is now come abroad to the view of the world, trans∣lated and printed at my cost, I was mooued by the reasons aforesaid, to craue your Ho∣nors patronage, that thereby I might the bet∣ter
 withstand, both the malicious toongs of such as carpe, and the manifest iniurie of such as are readie vnaduisedly to counterfet ano∣ther mans worke: The which your Lordships fauor obtained (as my hope is) shall binde me foreuer to praie for your Ho∣nors daily increase in all good things.
