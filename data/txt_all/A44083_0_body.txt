THE Providence of God having stirred me up for some years last past, to represent the dreadful Ruin and Misery and Destruction of the Loyal and Valiant Seamen of England, in the Destruction of their Lives, Health, and payment, in such a most deplorable Case as is in no Age or History Record∣ed, that I could hear or read of either of these Nations, or any o∣ther Nations, for the Sea-faring part of Mankind. And there ha∣ving been an Act of Parliament or two concerning their Relief, it may be supposed now all is well. But what shall I say, their Mise∣ries have been in some cases worse than before; as first, before those Acts, there were many Ships had three or four years Pay due to them, and now there is many have five or six Years Pay due to them. Secondly, Before they had, it may be, ten hundred thousand Pound due to them, but they have had above eigh∣teen hundred thousand Pound due to them for Wages, as the Ho∣nourable House of Commons in their votes last March declared was due to them at Michaelmas, 1697. And though there was a Pay∣ment
last Winter of near forty Ships, there were not four of them paid clearly off, but want to be Re call'd many thousands of Payments, and of above two hundred Ships put up for Re∣cals in August 97, there is above an hundred of them not paid one Groat since, and so there is some thousands of Payments of above 4, 5, and 6 years standing, as by the Printed List put up at the Navy-Office, and of the Ships names and times of Payment, will appear, two of which List I intend to present to the Honoura∣ble Speakers of the Houses of Lords and Commons, for the Hou∣ses to peruse, and two to present to his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, one for himself, and the other for his Majesty, and there every one may see that those poor Wretches Families that had run the hazard of Starving and perishing, by lying out of their honest Pay 3 or 4 Years, have now, to add to their full Ruin and Destruction, if possible, lain out 5 or 6 years or more, and there is ten or eleven Ships now at this time at Portsmouth, that have not been paid off this 4 or 5 years, most part, and having between Three and four hundred Thousand Pound due to them, as by the several Ships Books will appear; and though their Miseries have been so great, yet the Nation has been put to some hundreds of thousands of Pounds of needless Charge, that might have been saved, if they had been paid off when the War was ended, and as I said, there are many other Ships of several Years standing unpaid, that counting there was last year 1800000 pound due for Sea-Wages, and suppose 600000 paid since, four hundred Thousand grown due since, it will be found to be about Sixteen hundred Thousand Pound due at this Day for Wages; and how dreadfully ruined and Starving a Condition those Families must be in who have not had one Penny to support them with Bread or Cloaths to keep them from starving for 5 or 6 Years, cannot easily be known, nor easily Lamented, and as they have been worse paid, so also have they been worse fed since the Act of Parliament for their Relief; for before this Act sometimes a Ship was put to short Allowance for a few Weeks at Sea in Case of Necessity. But after the Act for their Encou∣ragement, they were most part of the Summer, and the greatest part of the Fleet put to Short Allowauce, Six Mn to have but four Mens Victuals, and that a great part of the Year 1697; and not only at Sea, but in Harbours at Portsmouth, and at Chatham, and wanted Bread at the Buoy of the Nore, as the Books of the
whole Fleet will make appear, and therefore let their incourage∣ment have appeared to be what it will, their discouragement was Augmented; and for that, and for some other Reasons. I would humbly entreat for the Loyal Seamen of England, that some part of that Act may be Repealed, or altered. But the first thing, which I believe both God and Justice, and Moral Honesty, and Humanity requires, is, to pay the Labourers, these miserable, poor, impoverished, beggered, ruined and undone Wretches, their Wages due to them, for their hire, that after the laying down of above Sixty Thousand of their Lives, and the Ruin and Running of above an Hundred Thousand of their Payments, that they are strip∣ped of by those fatal Letters, Q. R. The rest of their Payments not Ravished from them as yet openly, being near an Hundred and Forty Thousand Payments; may be honestly and speedily paid them; and that the Nation need not to excuse the Paying of them for want of Money, I would humbly propose how there might be the full Payment of them with Ease, before Lady-day, without Borrowing a Groat: That is, by the Issuing out of six∣teen, or 18 hundred Thousand Pounds of Chequer-Bills, as before; but they must be appropriated for the Payment of the Fleet only; for if there be five times as much raised, and it runs in other Chan∣nels, the Seamen may be as Miserable, and as Ruined still as be∣fore. I bless God, Since I did write great part of this, that God hath put it into the Hearts of the Honourable House of Commons to enquire into the state of the Sea Affairs, to see what is due, and what hath been paid since there was Eighteen hundred, and sixty Thousand Pound due at Michaelmas 1697, for Wages to the Fleet. But I would humbly intreat their Honours to Consider, That the Number of the Seamen in our Fleet, and Ships in our Fleet was much more than ever before, and perhaps a quarter more than need∣ed, if they had been led on to fight, by their Managers, as in o∣ther Ages. And it may be some will suppose, because there was about 37 Ships paid off the very Last Winter, altho' the Recalls was never paid, which perhaps is twice or three times as much, and because there hath been, it may be, twenty or thirty Ships Paid this year, though by the way, many of them have above a Year and quarters pay due still of the New, and some of them several Years of the Old. But it may be some will suppose the Fleet paid off, when as there were about 160 Ships Employed, as your Honours will sind; and if Forty Ships Paid in a Year, will
be four Years in Paying at that Rate, and yet make a great noise, to pay off ten Ships every 12 or 13 Weeks, and at that rate of paying off Thirty or Forty Ships in the Year, must of necessi∣ty be two or three years made in payment of them off, and then for the Recalls of the Hundred and odd Ships un-recalled, as by the printed List will appear, if they begin to recall them, and pay off a Ship every Week, it must be above two Years time in Paying them, and the Ships that were pretended to be Paid off last Year, and having so many Thousands now left unpaid; if they be Paid off fully, one Ship in a Week, will be near ano∣ther Years Work. So that, unless God Almighty put it into your Honours Hearts for to consider their Ruined Case, here is like to be of Necessity three or four Years time more, before the ru∣ined, Begger'd Seamen be all paid, as any that will but count the Number of the Ships aforesaid, may easily find; or if your Ho∣nours would but count the more than two Millions of Wages due for Pay of the Fleet since the 1st of October 1697. and what is Paid since, and if your Honours find that there hath not been a∣bove Seven or Eight Hundred Thousand Pound paid in the Year 1697. and 1698. Then at that rate, considering the great Number of Ships pretended to be paid, that have above a Year and a quarters Pay already, and the growing Pay coming due, it will require 3 or 4 Years time to Pay them off at that rate, which will be Misery to Misery, and Ruin to Ruin: And if it should be objected, that the Army must be Paid off first; to that I would humbly An∣swer, That if the Honourable Houses will raise Three millions of Exchequer-Bills, it would pay off the Fleet, and Army before May-Day, and save his Majesty the Trouble and Charge of Borrow∣ing Money at I know not what prodigious Charge, Procuration, and Continuation; and these Three Millions of Bills would be of use to his Majesty, and the Nation, and either save the hoarding up of our Ready-money by the Great, and Rich; or these Bills, if returned but twenty times in a Year, or thirty times in two Years, one Bill with another, among Tradesmen, they might, at ten in the Hundred Profit, gain the Value of the Bills three times over; and we find by daily experience now, that those Exche∣quer Bills now out, are hoarded up, and esteemed better than Gold or Silver; and as to calling in of the 3 Millions of Bills, the Honourable House of Commons might settle a sufficient Fund, either by a 3 aid, as this last Year, or by what means and ways
their Honours in their great Wisdoms do think sit. But that there is a necessity of paying off the miserable, Ragged, Ruined Sea∣men, and their Beggered, and Perishing Widows, Wives, or Relations: I have humbly presumed to lay down several Reasons, and if any should ask why I do put my self to the Charge and Hazard to represent their Ruin, having not bought one Penny of their Pay these 4 or 5 Years, to that I would humbly an∣swer, That their Ruin, and Destruction, and starving Conditi∣tion of them and their Family cries so loud in my Ears, and afflicts my very Soul, that I cannot forbear Representing their miserable Casel, having known so much of their Continued Mi∣sery so many Years, that I have a Call from God, Angels, and Men, and my own Conscience, not to let their Ruins be hid; and if God Almighty Commanded the Jews under the Law not to let their enemies Ox or Ass lye in a Ditch without helping him out; Then certainly God will be well pleased that I should Labour to help His Majesty, and the Nations loving and faithful, serviceable As∣ses, the Seamen and their Families, that lye in the Ditches of Po∣verty and Ruin, to help them out, by endeavouring to cry out to His Majesty, and your Honours.
I Remember a Story I have read in the Book of Martyrs, that it was a Saying of an Outlandish Priest in the times of Popery, That the Englishmen were good Asses, and would bear all Burthens. And I do believe I may say in the Presence of the Lord, before whom I write, That there were never such a number of faithful, mise∣rable, contented Asses belong'd to the Sea in any Ages of the World, who died and perished at that dreadful Rate, above 60 Thousand of them, as the Ships Books prove, and were a∣bove a hundred Thousand of them run out of their Pay, and the rest kept so many Years out of their Pay, and be contented to dye and perish without Speaking a Word of it; and I must say, Balaam's Ass was wise enough to tell his Case, and for my part, they are like never to know from me that they are any other Creatures. But Asses bear Asses Burthens, and if I were their Mouth, I would say, to the Nations in the words of Balaam's Ass; Are we not your Asses, upon which ye have Riden over since we were yours, and did we ever Rebel against you, and wherefore have you smitten us these three times so dreadfully out of our Lines, Liberties, and Payments. And I suppose some will not Represent their Case, because they cannot,
and some others that know their Ruins, get Estates by it, in buying many of their Tickets at eight, or ten, or twelve Shillings in the Pound Loss, which is the Devil and all of Extortion, and I be∣lieve will Cry in the Ears of God, Angels, and Men, either for the Relief of the Oppressed, and punishing the dreadful Extor∣tortioners, or Vengeance on the Oppressors; and indeed, I have read much in the Prophets, of the Oppressors and Extortioners, that God complain'd of against Israel; but could never find, neither in the Scripture, nor in Josephus's History, or any other History, that there was any could parallel the Extortion, and Ruin exercised on the brave, Couragious Seamen of England. I shall say more in the Reasons following, and leave all to the Serious Considerati∣on of His Gratious Majesty, and the two most Honourable Hou∣ses, and lay my self at their Feet, humbly begging Fardon for whatever is amiss in this, or me; and either in doing, or Suf∣fering, shall still subscribe my self to be His Majesty's Most Humble, and Hearty, and Loving Servant to Command,
Hermitage-Bridge, Jan. 1699.
