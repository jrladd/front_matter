MY LORD,
I Have now by the assistance of God, and the advantages of your many favours, finished a Year of Sermons; which if, like the first year of our Savi∣ours preaching, it may be annus acceptabilis, an acceptable year to God, and his afflicted hand-maid the Church of England, a reliefe to some of her new necessities, and an in∣stitution or assistance to any soule; I shall esteem it among those honors and blessings, with which God uses to reward those good intentions which himselfe first puts into our hearts, and then recompenses upon our heads. My Lord, They were first pre∣sented to God in the ministeries of your family: For this is a blessing for which your Lordship is to blesse

God, that your Family is like Gideons Fleece, irriguous with a dew from heaven, when much of the voicinage is dry; for we have cause to remember that Isaac complain'd of the Philistims, who fill'd up his wells with stones, and rubbish, and left no beauvrage for the Flocks; and therefore they could give no milke to them that waited upon the Flocks, and the flocks could not be gathered, nor fed, nor defended. It was a designe of ruine, and had in it the greatest hostility; and so it hath been lately;
—undi{que} totis
Vsque adeo turbatur agris. En! ipse capellas
Protenus aeger ago; hanc etiam vix Tityre duco.
But, My Lord, this is not all: I would faine also complaine that men feele not their greatest evill, and are not sensible of their danger, nor covetous of what they want, nor strive for that which is forbidden them; but that this complaint would suppose an unnaturall evill to rule in the hearts of men; For who would have in him so little of a Man, as not to be greedy of the Word of God, and of holy Ordinances, even therefore because they are so hard to have? and this evill, although it can have no excuse, yet it hath a great and a certain cause;

for the Word of God still creates new appe∣tites, as it satisfies the old; and enlarges the capacity, as it fils the first propensities of the Spirit. For all Spirituall blessings are seeds of Immortality, and of infinite felicities, they swell up to the comprehensions of Eternity; and the desires of the soule can never be wea∣ried, but when they are decayed; as the sto∣mach will be craving every day, unlesse it be sick and abused. But every mans experience tels him now, that because men have not Prea∣ching, they lesse desire it; their long fasting makes them not to love their meat; and so wee have cause to feare, the people will fall to an Atrophy, then to a loathing of holy food, and then Gods anger will follow the method of our sinne, and send a famine of the Word and Sacraments. This we have the greatest reason to feare, and this feare can be relieved by nothing but by notices and experi∣ence of the greatnesse of the Divine mercies and goodnesse.
Against this danger in future, and evill in present, as you and all good men interpose their prayers, so have I added this little instance of my care and services; being willing to mi∣nister in all offices and varieties of imploy∣ment; that so I may by all meanes save some, and confirme others; or at least, that my selfe may be accepted of God in my desiring it.

And I thinke I have some reasons to expect a speciall mercy in this, because I finde by the con∣stitution of the Divine providence, and Ecclesi∣asticall affaires, that all the great necessities of the Church have been served by the zeale of preaching in publick, and other holy ministeries in publick or private, as they could be had. By this the Apostles planted the Church, and the primitive Bishops supported the faith of Mar∣tyrs, and the hardinesse of Confessors, and the austerity of the Retired. By this they confoun∣ded Hereticks, and evill livers, and taught them the wayes of the Spirit, and left them without pertinacy, or without excuse. It was Preaching that restored the splendour of the Church, when Barbarisme, and Warres, and Ignorance either sate in, or broke the Doctors Chaire in pieces: For then it was that divers Orders of religious, and especially of Preachers were erected; God inspiring into whole companies of men a zeal of Preaching: And by the same instrument God restored the beauty of the Church, when it was necessary shee should be reformed; it was the assiduous and learned preaching of those whom God chose for his Ministers in that work, that wrought the Advantages and persuaded those Truths, which are the enamel and beautie of our Churches. And because by the same meanes all things are preserved, by which they are pro∣duc'd, it cannot but be certaine, that the pre∣sent

state of the Church requires a greater care and prudence in this Ministerie then ever; espe∣cially since by Preaching some endevour to supplant Preacbing, and by intercepting the fruits of the flocks to dishearten the Shepheards from their attendances.
My Lord, your great noblenesse and religious charitie hath taken from mee some portions of that glory which I designed to my selfe in imi∣tation of St. Paul towards the Corinthian Church; who esteemed it his honour to preach to them without a revenue; and though also like him I have a trade, by which as I can be more usefull to others, and lesse burthensome to you, yet to you also under God, I owe the quiet and the opportunities and circumstances of that, as if God had so interweaved the support of my affaires with your charitie, that he would have no advantages passe upon mee, but by your interest; and that I should expect no re∣ward of the issues of my Calling, unlesse your Lordship have a share in the blessing.
My Lord, I give God thanks that my lot is fallen so fairely, and that I can serve your Lordship in that ministerie, by which I am bound to serve God, and that my gratitude and my duty are bound up in the same bundle; but now, that which was yours by a right of propriety, I have made publick, that it may still be more yours, and you derive to your

selfe a comfort, if you shall see the necessitie of others serv'd by that which you heard so dili∣gently, and accepted with so much pietie, and I am persuaded have entertain'd with that re∣ligion and obedience, which is the dutie of all those who know, that Sermons are arguments a∣gainst us, unlesse they make us better; and that no Sermon is received as it ought, un∣lesse it makes us quit a vice, or bee in love with vertue; unlesse we suffer it in some in∣stance or degree to doe the work of God upon our soules.
My Lord, in these Sermons I have medled with no mans interest, that onely excepted, which is Eternall; but if any mans vice was to be re∣proved, I have done it with as much severitie as I ought; some cases of Conscience I have here determined; but the speciall designe of the whole, is to describe the greater lines of Dutie, by speciall arguments: and if any witty Censu∣rer shall say, that I tell him nothing but what he knew before; I shall be contented with it, and rejoyce that he was so well instructed, and wish also that he needed not a Remembrancer: but if either in the first, or in the second; in the institution of some, or the reminding of others, I can doe God any service; no man ought to be offended, that Sermons are not like curious inquiries after New-nothings, but pursuances of Old truths. However, I have already

many faire earnests that your Lordship will bee pleased with this tender of my service, and expression of my great and dearest ob∣ligations, which you daily renew or continue upon,
My noblest Lord,
