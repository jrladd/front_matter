MY LORD,
THE Noble Character you are Master of, And the kind Re∣ception your Lordship has been pleas∣ed to give to Things of this Nature has embolden'd me to make this Pre∣sent to Your Lordship. And the Your Lordship's Hours are generall Employ'd in more serious Exercise
yet the Perusal of so Trifling a Pam∣phlet, may so soften your more severe Studies, as it may be counted a Di∣version, if it cannot have the Name of a Pleasure. My Lord, since the Corruption of the Age has been such, as to render Things Animate ill em∣ployers of their Reason, it is but just that the Things which are Inani∣mate, should serve as so many In∣structions to 'em; and to give Beasts, and Things void of Speech, the use of their Tongue, cannot be counted as Harm, since to take it from Man, who makes so ill use of it, would arry the appearance of Justice with it. The two Flags which rave Your Lordship's Acceptance, ontend for Religion and Loyalty,
and I cannot but think I have done Justice to that of the Court, in making it prevail in the Dispute, since the Church's has so far made a Forfeit of Both, as to have no very good Plea to Either. But, my Lord, there needs no giving your Lordship a light into my Design, who will but too soon (for its Author) give Your Judgment of it. All I have to do, is, to ask Your Lordship's Accept∣ance, and that You would be pleas'd to pardon the Deficiencies of,
My Lord,
