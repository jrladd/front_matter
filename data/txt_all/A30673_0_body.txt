MADAM,
IT fares with me, as 'tis fabled of Pan, that pretended Rural God, who being admit∣ted into Apollo's Presence to shew his skill upon his Oaten Pipe, at the first he was bash∣ful and timerous, but being uncontrouled, he grew bolder, and Pip't louder; This was my Case when I wrote the ensuing Letter, which was in a dark and gloomy Day; my Bashfulness, and Sense of Ʋnworthiness when it was finish'd, had like to have strangled it in the Womb, and to have kept it from your sight, fearing what
 Reception it might meet with; but knowing what ever was wanting, a good Meaning and an Intention to do good was not wanting; and after some conflict in my self, I resolved to put it to the venture, and send it I did, but your ind Acceptance beyond my Expectation, made me Pipe louder, and without your privity I sent it to the Press, thinking, that having past this Test, and you approving of it, others al¦so might possibly do the same, but had you past it by with a Check or Disrespect, you had spoiled my Musick; yet durst I not pre∣fix your Name to it, as thinking it unworthy of you. But your kind Acceptance of it when it was Printed, and Approbation, doth make me yet bolder to prefix your Name, and tell the World to whom it doth of right belong; and this will be some excuse for me, that you did not manifest your dislike, nor forbid me to do it, the Reasons why I did this, and do now again Publish it were given you then, there were many worthy Friends then, and since that time, that lay under the like Di∣spensation of Providence that you did, viz. That had parted with their near Relations, to whom I was willing to give a Word of Advice and Comfort but my Occasions would not permit me to Speak or Write to all, neither was I able to do it to all that needed my Advice; I there∣fore imagining what doth one good, may benefit another also, I made it publick; this Letter
 may speak my Mind when I am absent, even to those to whom I cannot come; for I see Grace itself will not wipe off immoderate Tears, but they sometimes flow like a mighty Torrent with∣out Bank or Bottom, and tho' here be some things peculiar to your Condition in the Let∣ter, yet in the general 'tis of publick concern, the Disease is common, and the Receipt I hope will not be useless. Most People first or last are concerned in parting with Relations, here are Considerations to quiet them, at least they see the Death of others as well as of their Re∣lations; and here are profitable Instructions to improve that for their own good, and Directi∣on how to prepare for their own Death. These Considerations made me make that publick, which at first was intended for private use, and I hope this second Edition will give your Ladi∣ship, no Offence, nor to read your Name in the Front; when I sent the Letter to you, I did foresee that I must shortly come into the Fur∣nace again, and so I did the very Week I re∣ceived the printed Book, I Bried my eldest Son; as you had done your eldest Daughter, and how soon I may have another Trial I know not. The Lord grant I may learn the Lesson my self I am teaching others; some Additions I have made, at the Request of several which may be more needful to others then to you; I hope they tend towards the perfection, not im∣perfection of the Book. But I forget my self,
 the whole being but a Letter, and that to your Ladiship; I must not make the Gate too wide for the Building. I shall cease further to trou∣ble you, when I have committed you and your dear Relations into the Hands of him that ne∣ver leaveth his, and subscribed my self
MADAM,
