MInerua, fained goddesse of best skill,
Seem'd friendles to my sad & feeble Muse:
The Sisters nine bar'd me Parnassus hill,
Mount Helicon, where praised Poets vse:
Therefore (my Lord) my pen deserues no praise,
But pardon. Honor pardons weake essayes.


The Change of things, in slender verse I sing,
A weighty subiect, common yet to all:
From lowest creature to the loftiest thing,
Nature her workes doth tosse like Tennis ball,
Now rayz'd by force, then downe again by poyze,
Rising ne falling, she showes not by noyze.



But when sterne Time eche thing created sees,
She fawnes a while, and tenters it on Pride,
And soone she frownes, and then forthwith decrees
To pull it downe, and lay that thing aside.
Yet as a mother, she againe doth beare
Some new: and that a while she doth vpreare.


Thus Time by turnes, turnes all things out of date,
And will preuaile till she her selfe haue end:
For sure things changes, proue time terminate:
And times exchanges doth her turne portend.
This time once gone, a timelesse time shall bee:
Till then in things a changing state wee see.


This mooues my Muse, erst silent, now to sing,
Though slenderly, the swift exchange of things:
And this to you (my Lord) I fearfull, bring,
Wishing that time, that plants & puls downe Kings,
Would daigne long time to her that still is one,
By whome we here enioy true Helicon.
