AN unknowne person, (and desires so to be) the meanest of many Thousands, presents these papers to your hands, which he call a Booke, having (he doubts not) Truth and reason for its Parrons Libri, hoc nomine dignandi, in verita∣tis tantum et rationis clientelam se dare debent. Ver. de Aug. l 1.; Therefore he does not doubt, but yee will be its Patrons too; yee will countenance these, where-ever you find them, though amidst some refuse, bearing GODS Image and superscription. For the man, you will weigh him with his full allowance,
 he needs all that, and he looks for no more. So far as he dares trust a great Deceiver, he dares say, That he has no other end in this, but the glory of GOD, and good of his brother: That he may be informed, if ig∣norant; confirmed, if weake; convinced, if froward and obstinate, That is the White he levells at. There are Three maine Exceptions. 1) Against the Title, It is a Dialogue. (2) Against the Author, A knowne enemy to Bishops, sayes Here-say, a most notorious liar. (3) A∣gainst the wayes of worship now: For some say, There be two. I shall endeavour to give cleare satisfaction to all this in the next Pages. I cease here to interrupt you any farther, so fixed upon your worke, Earnestly con∣tending for the faith; and striving together each with o∣ther, and for other, in your prayers
Now the good will of Him, That now dwells in the Bush, dwell in your Assembly (upon that glory let That defence be) and in your houses, To supply your absence, and all needs there; In your severall Congre∣gations, and be a small Sanctuary there; In your hearts, and be Lord and King there, Amen. The GOD of Truth, lead you into all Truth, Amen. The Lord of Peace Himselfe, give you peace alwayes by all meanes, That no occasion be given to the Adversary to speake reproachfully, Amen. The LORD be with you all, Amen. Take you by the hand, keepe you in His way, hold you fast to it for the Churches good, and your owne good everla∣sting, Amen and Amen.
