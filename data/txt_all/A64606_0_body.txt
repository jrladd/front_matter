MY LORD,
BEing confident, that your gracious
disposition will hold in greater account
the ingenuous meaning of who gives,



then the sufficiency of the present: I here
tender to the favour of your Honours acce∣ptance
a bundle of Epigrams; Which
though they be but flashes of wit, and such,
as may with advantage receive point from
your ordinary conceptions: yet for that nothing
doth better recommend them, then vivacitie
of concet, I cannot figure to my fancie a fitter
Patron to protect the sublimest Poems of this
Nature, then your owne Noble selfe; of whose
valour, and prudence, even from your infan∣cie,
both this, and forraine Nations will afford
an approbation so Authentick, that by the u∣niversall
consent of all, that ever knew your
Lordship, the depth of experience since the me∣mory
of man was never seene wedded to fewer
yeares: nor the splendor of heroicke vertue to
the astonishment of whole Armies, and Prin∣ces
Palaces, more evidently apparent, then in
the magnanimity of your generous car∣riage.
What formerly, by the most vertuous, and
pregnant wits, could not bee acquired without
a long continuance of time: and was esteemed
to be incompatible with youth (and much
more extraordinary in young gallants, then
gray haires, or the Gout) hath beene still in
your Lordship, a quality concomitant to the
source of all your actions: coaevall with the
gentile powers of your mind: and no lesse natu∣rall,



then to speake, or thinke.
And what others, not being able to reach
into (have therefore admired in the Legend
of the Worthies) hath, since the yeares of dis∣cretion,
bin the constant Object of your dailie
exercise, and complyed with your very most
neglected cogitations: Which glorious, and
rare endowments, out-reaching the extent of
vulgar goodnesse, and seeming the more won∣derfull,
that it is not long since by your
birth, you did grace the World with the honour
of your presence, doe possesse the faculties of my
soule with a stedfast resolution, so unfainedly
to acknowledge the absolute right, your Lord∣ship
hath over me, and the inclinations of my
mind: that, as I cannot impart that portion
of the fruits thereof to any, which by a prior
disposition is not already yours: so may not I
(though the matter be but small) without
breach of duty, devote this Dedication to ano¦ther.
Therefore (my Lord) you may be pleased, ac∣cording
to your accustomed manner, to vouch∣safe
a courteous entertainment to this testi∣mony
of my regard: till Fortune be so favou∣rable,
as to blesse me with the opportunity, one
day to make knowne my designments more ef∣fectually
yours; for the best of my affections, be∣ing
touched with the Magnetick vertue of your
good parts, are fixed on you, as on their Pol-estar



which serveth to direct the course of my life
in a continuall progresse of embracing all
the occasions, whereby I may testifie,
how earnest I am, and alwayes
shall be, deservingly to ob∣taine
the title
Of
Yours
My Lord
in all humilitie of sincere
respect, to serve your
Lordship.
