My LORD,
OFFenders, long conniv'd at, come at last to be try'd for their Lives, and are forc'd to call upon their fatally indulgent friends to bring them off: for Volunteer Poets are at least as mad as those who, out of wantonness play themselves into the Gallies. 'Tis high time to cast my self at your Lordships, Feet, and hum∣bly beg your Protection to this ride Piece, which grew the bold∣er by your incouragement. All Poems in their Dedications, ought to return to your Lordship, as all Rivers to the Sea, from whose depth and Saltness they are season'd and supply'd: none of them ever coming to your Lordship's hands, without receiving some of the rich Tinctures of your unerring Judge∣ment; and running with much more clearness, having past so fine a strainer. If this receives any approbation in the World, I must ascribe it principally to your Lordship's partial recommendations, and impartial corrections. Your Lordship is the first person in the World, by whom I have been Highly and Heroically oblig'd: and if the first Impressions of Gratitude, may be as strong and captivating, as those of the first Love; they must needs be much more lasting and immutable, in my Passion for your Lordship; since the World affords no object so high and admirable, ever

to work a change; your Lordship being the most accomplish'd of all Mankind, that I ever knew, read, or heard of, by Hu∣mane testimony. Eminent Beings are as hard to be believ'd, as they are to be understood: and no Man can speak Truth of your Lordship's Superlative Endowments, without suspicion of Flattery; nor conceal them without conviction of Ignorance. That famous Temper of weight, so rarely found in Bodies, ap∣pears most Illustriously in your Lordship's Mind. Judgement, and Fancy, seldom concurring in other Men, in any small pro∣portion, are possest by your Lordship in the highest degree that ever was allow'd the Soul of Man; yet with so happy and har∣monious a mixture, that neither of them predominate nor usurp; but, like two peaceful Colleagues in Empire, agree within them∣selves, and govern the rest of the World; acting in your Lord∣ships noble, and elevated Mind, like Fire and Air in the up∣per Region, whose Purity makes them easily convertible, and mutually assistant, whilst they are always quarrelling and prey∣ing upon each other, in gross inferior Bodies. What was favour∣ably said of my Lord Bacon in his time, may much more justly be affirm'd of your Lordship, in yours; That if ever there were a beam of Knowledge, immediately deriv'd from God, upon any Man, since the Creation, there is one upon your self. Others, by wearisome steps, and regular gradations, climb up to know∣ledge; your Lordship is flown up to the top of the Hill: you are an Enthusiast in Wit; a Poet and Philosopher by Revelation; and have already in your tender age, set out such new and glorious Lights in Poetry, yet those so Orthodox and Vnquestionable, that all the Heroes of Antiquity, must submit, or Homer and Virgil be judg'd Nonconformists. For my part, I account it one of the great felicities of my life, to have liv'd in your age; but much greater, to have had access to your Person, and to have been cherysh'd and enlighten'd by the influences, and irradiations of so great a Luminary. For, I must confess, I never return from your Lordships most Charming and Instructive Conversation, but I am inspir'd with a new Genius, and improv'd in all those Sci∣ences. I ever coveted the knowledge of: I find my self, not on∣ly a better Poet, a better Philosopher; but, much more than these, a better Christian: your Lordship's-miraculous Wit; and

Intellectual pow'rs being the greatest Argument that ever I could meet with, for the immateriality of the Soul; they being the high∣est exaltation of humane Nature; and, under Divine Autho∣rity, much more convincing to suspicious Reason, than all the Pedantick proofs of the most Learnedly peevish Disputants: so that, I hope, I shall be oblig'd to your Lordship, not only for my Reputation in this World, but my future Happiness in the next. Reflect then, my Lord, I beseech you, on your own sublime per∣fections, the profuseness of your Favors, my powerful (though presumptuous) inclination to your Person, and judge if it be possible, for any other Man living to pay your Lordship so sincere and affectionate a Veneration, as
My Lord,
Your Lordships most Devoted,
Obedient, and Humble Servant,
