THe occasion which induc'd me to the
writing of this Discourse hath been
already touched at in our general Pre∣face,
and shall be shewn thee more at large
in the following Preamble or Introduction.
Let it suffice thee now to know, that it was
done on an occasion really given, and not in
supposition only, the better to bring in the
Design which I have in hand; and that it
gave such satisfaction to the Party for whose

sake it was undertaken, that it was thought
fit by some to have it publisht for the Use
of others. But being published by a faulty
and imperfect Copy, I caus'd it presently
to be call'd in; not willing it should goe
abroad (though without my Name) till it
were able in some measure to defend it
self, if not to justifie the Authour. Being
now set upon a resolution, which God
bless me me in, of vindicating this poor
Church (as far at least as in me is) in her
Forms of Worship, her Government and
establisht Patrimony, together with the
Times and Places destinate to her Sacred Of∣fices;
I have thought good to place this
Tractate in the Front, as a Praecognitum or
necessary Manuduction unto all the rest. The
way and manner of the Reformation of the
Church of England declared and justified, can∣not
but give a good Relish unto all that
follows, being no other then the Essenti∣all
parts and branches of that Reformati∣on.
If thou art satisfied in this, it will
be a faire Omen to me, that the rest may
not prove unwelcome. And that thou mayst

peruse it with the greater chearfulness; I
will not keep thee longer in the Entrance
of it; it being no good Husbandry to
waste that Friend in petit Matters, whom
we endeavour to preserve for nobler fa∣vours.
And so fare thee well.
