RIght Honourable, knowing the tedious∣nesse
of time, to bee best beeguiled by the
sweetnesse of exercise, I haue exercised the
nine sweet Muses, with greedy affection, to
delight the tenth. Your Honour, is the same
excelent tenth Muse, of more in valewable
worth then the other nine. To your de∣light,
I consecrate my duties, and offer vp
my nights labors for your dayes pleasures, and voutsafe noble
Lord, to grace the offering by your kinde acceptacion, & enter∣taine
with fauor, the offerers entire deuocion. In your faworable
regard, consisteth my safest gard, and my Muses securitie in your
Honours satisfaction. If I satisfie not you, I satisfie not any, al-
though all beesids. If I content you, I hope I shall content all,
whom I am to haue regard not to discontent, & therby I gaine,
which is the sweetest gaine, the comfort of my labors. I therfore
right humbly beeseech your Honour, not presuming vppon
the worth of so poore and base a present, but vppon the wor∣thinesse
of your owne noble hart, that this may rest secure vn∣der
your Honourable patronage, as vnder priuiledge of a religi-
ous Sanctuarij, commended by your redie acceptance, and de∣fended
by your fauorable countenance.
