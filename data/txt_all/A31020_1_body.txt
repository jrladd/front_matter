Madam,
WHen last I came to kisse your hands, you were
Reading the Legend of the Trojan Warre.
Then did you wish t'have seen that peerlesse Dame,
Whose forme (rarer then wonder) partiall fame
Proclameth with so loud a blast, as it
Fires coldest hearts, and deafest eares doth hit.
You mus'd of what fine clay Titan did make
Her, better than the rest, that for her sake
Th' hot Phrygian Prince thought it not much to come
To scarse known Greece, from remote Ilium;
And that Greece thought not millions lives too deare,
With all her Mines to boot, to ransome her;
And that the Teurans did not stick to fill
Their Trenches with their blouds to guard her still.
If her Effigies, or a better face,
Madam, you long to see, look in your Glasse.
