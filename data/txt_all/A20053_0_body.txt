Honorable Praetor:
Noble Consuls.
YOu are (this Yeare) the Subiect of my Verse,
In You lye hid the Fires which heate my Braines,
To You, my Songs Triumphant I rehearse:
From you, a thankes brings in a golden Gaines,
Since You are then the Glory of my Muse,
But You, whom can shee for her Patrons chuse?
