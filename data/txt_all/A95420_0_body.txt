My Lord;
THE Doctour of the Gentiles, of whom it is cer∣taine some of us English-men are descended, (though many are degenerated into the very faith, or rather perfidiousnes of the Jewes: some turnd
Nulli-fidians, others plain Canni∣bals, delighting with Cyrus in raw flesh, and to wallow in bloud,) almost all Barbarians, not knowing, at least not regarding Divine, Nationall, or Martiall Lawes; I say this great Doctour writing to the Thessalonians with purpose to mitigate their sorrow, for some departed friends, insists altogether on the resurrection, and future glory, that by the evidence of this argument they might assure themselves they had not lost, but should certainely enjoy (and in the plenitude of all pleasures) their dead friends. I will not say your Honour has lost, but sent before you a most noble Brother, whose death (like that of the Queene of Scots) our most gracious Soveraignes Grandmother (sic parvis componere magna, &c.) as it will redound to the perpetuall infamy of our Nation, so it shall be a lasting Ornament to your noble family; and therefore you may with symphoniack voices, and choisest melody prosecute the fune∣ralls of your most Loyall and worthy Brother; and such as Ma∣crobius witnesseth was the custome of the wisest Gentiles in per∣forming the solemne obsequies of those Heroes, who had sacrificed their lives for the safety of their Countrey, assuring themselves their noble soules were translated hence to heare the harmonious melody resulting (as
Pythagoras constantly affirmed) from the divinely ordred conversion of the heavenly spheres, and therefore
 those Ancients would accordingly with musique, and honour con∣duct such happy spirits to the joyful mansions of eternall beatitude: These gnomicall, yet consolatory Monodies of Statius in Epi∣cedio Glauci are too generall for your heroik thoughts.


All dye, or else shall dye, the dayes and nights
Are borne, and vanish: STARS put out their lights,
Who for this thing call'd Man, will wet his eyes,
That by so many severall chaunces dyes?

But certainely what Seneca writes to his honourable friend Po∣lybius, Cum plus aequo fratris morte perturbaretur, may be ad∣dressed to your noble selfe; Cum voles rerum omn ium oblivisci, cogita Caesarem; fas non est tibi recordato Caesare de fortuna queri; especialy reflecting how your noble Brother so justly payd Caesar what was Caesars, couragiously dying for his Prince and Countrey, and as that famous Epaminondas the glo∣ry of Thebes left two illustrius Daughters behinde him the Vi∣ctories at Leuctra and Mantinea to perpetuate his memory: In like manner so many battailes in the defence of our King and King∣dome, and Colchester with such galantry defended are the ever-li∣ving Off-spring of your renowned Brothers vertues; and may solidly comfort your Honour in the absence of so brave a Parent of them, and your so neere Kinsman, which are the hearty desires of, Your
