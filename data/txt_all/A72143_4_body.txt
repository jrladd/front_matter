This the rather, because I as∣sure my selfe, that you are both of you of the Persons therein decyphered, and have joint share therefore in the Benefit therein propounded and promised. For the Worke it selfe; I doubt not, but many things will bee found in it, that to a meere Naturall Man will seeme to bee.

So it is indeed thatOpera. Dei sunt in mediis contrariis. Lu∣ther. apud Paulum ab Eitzen in Genes. . Greg. Naz. in Cypr. GODS Workes (as that blessedVerè . Quod de Bapt. Domi∣nus Ioan. 5.35. Light of GOD Martine Luther, was wont to say) are effected usually by Contraries. And a Christian Mans Life here (asAeternitas rerum constat contrariis. Se∣nec. ep. 107. . Eurip. Plut. de tranquill. . Menand. Stob. c. 93. the Heathen Man said of eve∣ry Mans) is a meere Mixture of. Caesarius apud Greg. Naz. ep. 59. Contrarieties.Psal. 34.19. & 73.14. Luk. 9.23. & 21.12, 16, 17. Act. 14.22. 1 Cor. 15.19. None incumbred with more Crosses; butLuk. 9.24. & 21.18. 2 Cor. 1 3, 4, 5. & 2.14 & 6.10. & 10.4. none accompanied with more Comforts, and those such as may well not countervaile onely, but even through∣ly weigh downe the other. In so much, that I see not why a Christian Man, though exposed to such a multitude of Crosses, (were it not for his owne, ei∣ther want of Wisedome, or weaknesse) might not well live the comfortablest life of any Man in the World, whatsoever estate or condition of life GOD hath pleased to assigne and confine him unto. Nor have any therefore cause to waive the profession of Christia∣nitie in regard of such Crosses, as a disconsolate and uncomfortable estate. Of Children wee use to say, that they are. Plut. de prolis amore. . Incertus Author. . Democrit. apud Stob. cap. 74. . Evenus apud Plut. de am. prol. Certaine Cares, uncertaine Comforts; and yet wee seeGen. 15.2. & 30.1. Iohn 16.21. ; Menand apud Stob. c. 73. how desirous naturally Men and Women are to have Issue: and that,1 Sam. 1.6, 7, 8, 11. . Idem ibid. even those al∣so that for outward things mihgt well live comfor∣tably
 without. How much more have all cause to desire Christian Grace, when the Comforts that attend it, are so sure and certaine, if men bee not their owne enemies; yea when no sound Comfort (as is here shewed) can bee at∣tained without it; Unworthie is hee of Issue, that. Eurip. Oenoma. estee∣meth not the Care hee taketh for his Children, especi∣ally.—Eurip. Me∣leagr. . —Menand. being toward, dutifull, and inclinable to good things,. Eurip. Danae.—. Idem Androm. inde restituendus apud Stob. cap. 74. abundantly over-countervailed in the Comfort he hath or may have of them. Nor is hee worthie of Christ, that accounteth not the Crosses that Christiani∣tie and the Profession of it may procure, (for of other Crosses that worldly men are alike subject to with such, what need I say ought? and yet let these goe also in the same reckoning with those;) all abundantlyRom. 5.2, 3. & 8.18. over∣countervailed with those spirituall Comforts, that the as∣surance of Gods favour towards him in Christ Jesus may af∣ford him, if the Eye of his Soule bee throughly opened duly to apprehend it. This mine endevour is to shew in this weake Discourse; (the weaker,. Languente mens & languet unâ corpore. because amids much weaknesse during my late restraint by sicknesse, out of broken Notes, either reserved by my selfe, or taken by others from my mouth, as they are wont to bee, at the time of the deliverie of it, with addition of such things as came then further to minde, and seemed not altoge∣ther impertinent, it was by peece-meale put together:) and to encite all good Christians (notwithstanding such oc∣currents) to strive and straine themselvesPsal. 13.4, 5. & 42, 5, 11. by their cheere∣full carriage in such cases, to seale up the truth of it (which they cannot but acknowledge;) to those that may que∣stion it, or make doubt of it. This was I the rather endu∣ced to take some paines in, supposing that other weake ones like my selfe, (for of such am I bold to judge, as. Greg. Naz. in Iulian. 1. . Idem post redit. suum. Hoc enim proclivius homo suspicatur in alio quod sentit in seipso. Aug. in Psal. 118. conc. 12. the manner is, by my selfe;) being ordinarily too too backward herein, might have need of some quickening and stirring up thereunto. To which purpose if it shall be availeable unto any the meanest, I shall have cause to blesse
 God for his Blessing thereupon. If to your selves among others, Persons for Place and Pietie so eminent, (for even. Greg. Naz. in Basil. the worthiest also have their wants; nor doe the best joy so much as they either ought or might in this their Blessed Estate; andLiceat usurpare Pau∣li illud Rom. 15.14, 15.

Let it howsoever testifie my deserved respect to you both, and my thankefull acknowledgement of your Lordships kindnesse shewed me in my friend and my selfe, at home and abroad. So with unfained thankes to Gods Goodnesse for your Lordships Safe returne to us, re∣served, I hope, in mercy for further Service to God and his Church; and heartie Prayer for the continu∣ance of health and well-fare, such especially as3 Iohn 2.
