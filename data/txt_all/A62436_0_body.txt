MY LORD,
YOU have so obliged
this whole NATION
to Love and Honour
you, for those many eminent
Graces and Virtues conspicuous

in you, especially that transcen∣dent
Charity towards your Neigh∣bour
in time of Extremity; that
should I, conscious of your No∣ble
Actions, having so fit an op∣portunity,
neglect to render
you Thanks, and to celebrate
your Praises, for your bounty
and liberality to this miserable Ci∣ty,
when the Contagion was gras∣sant
to the depopulating and de∣pauperating
of it, I might deser∣vedly
be reckoned among un∣gratefull
men; Augustam Animam
Augusto in pectore gestas; you

have a Soul like the Image of the
Great Creator, of a vast extent,
diffusive, communicative, bene∣ficial
to good and bad. Sir, you
have given such example of Cha∣rity
upon this late Exigent, as
more powerful to convert this
hard-hearted Age, than the Tongue
of Men and Angels. Certainly,
the presence of your Person, hath
been a means to counterpoise the
evil effects of fugitive Physicians;
so that many probably have e∣vaded
the fury of the late Pest,
through a strong Imagination that

it was not so Contagious and Mor∣tal
(as was conceived) because
a Person of your Dignity did dare
to tarry here when it was most
outragious. Blessed be the Wise
Disposer of all things, who hath
preserved you to be an Instru∣ment
for his further Glory, the Be∣nefit
of your Countrey, and the
maintenance of FUNDAMENTAL
TRUTHS against all Opposers.
And now I draw a little nigher
your Lordship, offering to you
the First-fruits of my Diffi∣cult
Labours, collected in the

time of the Raging Pest. The
Substance of this Discourse is Pra∣ctical,
no idle Dogmatical Fancy
of a Non Ens, no Necessary Di∣rections
from Hearsaid; But I
have here laid open what I visi∣bly
and experimentally have
found to be true, what I have
handled with these hands, and
seen with these eyes. Really,
Noble Sir, all that I begg of your
Honour is, That you would be
pleased to favour me so far, as I
Speak, Write, and Act according
to Truth: which I know is so

prevalent, that maugre all Ad∣versaries,
it will at length be
Triumphant, and bestow upon
all Honest Endeavours an Immor∣tal
Crown of Glory.
Your Lordships most Humble,
and Affectionate Servant,
