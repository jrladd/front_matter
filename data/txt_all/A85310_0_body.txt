May it please your Excellency, with you
all,
WHat I have heard, seen, and understood, is present∣ed to
you in this book; it craves your attention, because it relates to you: It
hath the boldness to cry aloud, and not to spare, to shew the Lords
Hoast their transgression, and the house of Jacob their
sin: It breaks the order and custom of the world in courting you, and,
clothing it self with the spirit of Truth and burning, judges you.
Peradventure it may be a stone of stum∣bling, and a rock of offence to you,
yea, to both the houses of Is∣rael: The Spirit would have it so;
for you must fall, that you may rise; dye, that you may live; be nothing,
that you may be all. You have much glory to lose, some of you the Glory,
Rule, and Go∣vernment of the World; others of you the Glory and Rule of the
Church, and yet many of you have a greater Glory to possess: Your wood,
hay, and stubble, shall be burnt up, you shall suffer loss, but ye
shall be saved, yet so, as by fire: Your loss shall be your gain, and
your shame, your praise; yet for the present you will be so shameful
as to cover the glory of the Lord, rather then you will lie in the dust, and
part with what you have by strength obtained.
