PRaier is the true Christian pro∣per element, without which hee can no more liue, then without fire: Breath is the instrument of the life of the body; Prayer is the breath of the
soule: I haue obserued in many a difficulty of this breathing, which I haue endeauoured ac∣cording to my simple skill, something to re∣medie by this directi∣on.
I humbly desire your Ladiship to giue it leaue to passe vnder your worthy Name: I confesse it can bee no waies vseful to you; but it may bee to weaker Christians, who are yet as babes newly begin∣ning to cry, Abba Fa∣ther.
Herein I present my thankfull mind to your
Ladiship, whose great fauours and encourage∣ments, my deserts can neuer equall. I daily pray for your Ladiship, that as God hath highly aduanced your Name on earth for godlinesse, so he would in the time appointed, glorifie your soule in heauen, for the merits of your Iesus.
