Honoured Sir,
I Have ventured upon a great work, I do need a Patron; I beseech you, be you mine, and the Citie's. The Subject, I know, can∣not displease you; it is about a peni∣tent City, and Gods pleading for it, to have it spared. Would it not be your comfort, to see your City thus qualifi∣ed? Would it not be your joy, to behold it thus secured? Yes; your vertue, I know, doth desire the repentance of it; and your zeal, the safety of it. Who knowes, but the motion may take place? God, of Stones, can raise up Children to Abraham; the Womb of the Barren may be fruitfull. This City, which hath learned little by
Pulpits, may learn much by a Pat∣tern.
I have prepared the Piece, and al∣tered and amplified it much, since the first drawing or preaching of it; that I might make it as exact, as mine Art would attain to. I desire to present it, by your fair and spotlesse hand, to your City; The innocency and piety of such a tried Citizen, may do much, to promove my intention, and to san∣ctifie the Work. Blesse but my en∣deavours with your Name, and the successe shall be left to God Almigh∣ty. Sir, I know you; therefore I am sparing in my exhortation. I seek a∣bout for others of your fellow-Citi∣sens, to them I shall enlarge my ad∣vice. Gods blessing light upon your Person, this Drift, and the City, that it may have Niniveh's graces, and Niniveh's felicity. Thus leaving my request to your charitable constructi∣on, and my suit at the Throne of God, with my humble service pre∣sented to You, submissively, I take leave, and rest.
