Right Honourable,
IT is necessary
that Christi∣ans
should bee
warned of sin
against God,
lest they incurre his wrath.
And withall it is as necessa∣ry
that the sins of which
men are warned should be

Plainely, and distinctly de∣clared.
Without the one
mens consciences will sinne
without feare: without the
other they will feare where
no feare is: the defect of
the former will make con∣sciences
secure: the want of
the latter perpetually un∣quiet,
or setled in errour.
And errours in conscience
produce many great evills
not onely ad intra in mens
owne soules, but also ad
extra in humane affaires.
The endeavouring then to
direct mens consciences in
practique cases cannot but
be a needfull and charita∣ble
worke.
And surely as it is usefull
in other arguments, so ve∣ry
needfull in this of scan∣dals.

Few there bee that
heed the terrible commina∣tion
of our Saviour against
scandalizers, and there∣fore
are affected as if by
transmigration they had
Cains spirit, when he said
nunquid ego fratris mei
custos? Whence it is that
offences are multiplyed
dayly, many soules perish,
alienations of minde,
schismes, jarres and warres
too arise. Wee wish, wee
pray, I would wee might
say we hope for a true uni∣on
and consolidation of
mens minds. Certainly it
is not to be hoped without
removeall of scandals. On
the other side the greivous
threatning of our Lord
Christ doth so affright ma∣ny

consciences, that they
are almost irresolute in e∣very
thing they doe before
men, as fearing least there
be anguis in herba, some
scandall in it. In my small
reading and experience I
find few doubts of consci∣ence,
concerning mens pa∣tent
actions, in the resolv∣ing
of which the difficulty
hath not most of all rested
on this point of scandals.
Which considerations
moved me to apply some
part of my studies to cleare
this argument, and to re∣move
this evill. And ha∣ving
in this forme fashio∣ned
a treatise, I cannot say
polished, it is now produ∣ced
into the light for pub∣lique
good by discovery of

truth. Such as it is I hum∣bly
present to your Lord∣ship,
as to a person made
honourable not only by your
high dignities, but also by
your noble vertues, mani∣fested
abroade in your em∣ployments
of State, and in
this your native countrey
(wherein as in your proper
Orbe you shined many
yeares tanquam stella pri∣mae
magnitudinis) by
your eminent prudence and
integrity in government,
and by your rare, pious, and
large munificence in resto∣ring
tithes, and bestowing
lands and building on the
Church, and indeared to
my selfe by reason of that
noble favour by which
your Honour hath beene

pleased to cheare me in
this very great, and very
poore Cure, in and under
which I now labour. Which
I beseech your Honour to
accept of as from him that
rejoyceth in the prosperity
of your Honour and your
noble House, and studies to
acquite himselfe
