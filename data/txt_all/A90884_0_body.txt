Dear Sister,
AS men usually Dedicate their works to their best beloved or most respected friend; so I De∣dicate this Treatise unto you, who after God have ever been the object of my dearest love and best respects; Be pleased then to peruse the same; for you will finde comfort in it, if you oppose or ap∣ply as Antidotes to the passions of Sorrow, Way-wardness and Fear incident to old age, the passions of Love, Hope, and Ʋndaunted∣ness; for the love of God will wan your af∣fections from the vanities of this life, and give them wings to soar up to heaven to six themselves upon that infinite object of all perfection God himself;Psal 6.11. In whose presence is fulness of joy, and at his right hand
pleasures for evermore. Secondly, the Christian hope you have to be made by the merits of Christ co-heir with him of the Kingdom of Glory, will expel all the sorrows, way wardness, and discontents, proceeding from the crosses and afflictions you are subject unto in this life. Lastly, your Christian for∣titude or undauntedness will annihilate, as the beams of the Sun doth the morning dew, the fears which may perplex your mind by the apprehension of the dart of death, and will make you say with confidence at your depar∣ture out of this vayl of Tears,Cor. 15.55. O death, where is thy sting? O grave where is thy Victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And so being confident you will accept this small evidence of my love with the same af∣fection it is presented unto you, I commend you to the Lords protection, desiring to re∣maine
Dear Sister, 
From London, June 1. 1651.
