J. St. N.
AN adventurer in the first Plantati∣on. A Sympathiser in your Joyes, Fears, Sorrows. A spectator, and obser∣ver of the mutual transactings twixt God and you, doth present this small Trea∣tise of the History of Baptism, the fruits of his retired thoughts in old Age, with a setled mind in quietness and comfort, to be weighed and considered with a se∣date spirit making allowance for hu∣mane Infirmities.
As that which he conceives may be of use in the further planting and propa∣gating the Gospel: And therefore is willing to leave this as a publick testi∣mony of his good will to that great and honourable work, which he heartily commends to the Blessing of him, who is the God of all grace and is able to strengthen, settle, stablish you. To him be Glory for ever. Amen.
