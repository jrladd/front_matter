MAdame, this Psalme was preached not long since at Bury. Afterward some desired the notes, short, ragged, broken, vnfit to profit any Reader, witnesse (at the first blush of them) your Ladi∣ship: to whom though, for that you are wont to thinke somewhat of my nothing, I presume to send them, onely in desire someway to witnesse my thanks, to GOD, for his grace bestowed on you in the mysterie of Christ, and for your L. kind∣nesse to me in that behalfe. I thinke of Sinaetas the Persian, who hauing nothing according to the fashion of his country to present Artaxerxes with, ranne to the Riuer Cyrus, and tooke both his hands full of water, and offered that. He was not much misliked, as for the necessity of water, so for the name of Cyrus which it bare. Foorthwith was it put to be kept in a golden flagon. The Scriptures are aboue allwater, and Dauid beyond any Cyrus, onely my vnmannerly hands may tincture, & lessen account. The Psalme is the same that euer it was, which if I haue any way ope∣ned, I thanke God. Howsoeuer, I wish the sweet fruite of it in your Ladiships hart, as I know God hath, and will more still there treasure it vp. Often pray this Psalme to God, and keepe these blotted leaues vnto your selfe. Serue them as they deserue. I were loth that euery body should know my rawnesse. Thus crauing humbly your pardon, I take my leaue. Bury.
