HIpercyan the vnskilfull Piper, when he had sounded vpon his Oaten reed his rustic Roundelaies in presence of God Mercurie, before whome, Orpheus (douting of his cunning) was ashamed to tune his Harpe: being at the first vncontroled, in the end began to blowe lowder. So I right worshipfull, not vnlike this rude Pi∣per, hauing presumed to tune my rustie stringes to larum foorth my simple musicke in the translation of the first parte of Blanchardines aduentures, in presence of you, whose learned censure as farre passeth my capacitie, as Mercuries cunning did poore Hipercyans skill: yet ha∣uing found your fauourable acceptance of the former, I am encouraged to perseuer in the dedicatiō of the second parte also, to you, his first and most worthy Patrone: o whose vasselage, not only many vndeserued fauours, but bountifull rewardes haue bound me during life, in all ob∣seruancie. And hauing no fitter meane to make manifest the integritie of my zeale, wherewith I honor your wor∣shipfull

house: I thought it my best to take hold of occa∣sion, whilest (in my conceit) she proffered her selfe to be taken, which I greatly feared, if now I should negligently ouerslip, I should scantly hereafter ouertake.
This consideration (right worshipfull) was the spur that prickt me forth to offer the simple kernell which this fruitlesse shell incloseth, to your fauourable view, which I trust you wil vouchsafe to accept, though not according to the value, which is nothing, yet for the dutifull desire of the giuer, which is my most: For in this I protest, you may well deccrne, that my willing minde dooth bewraie my good meaning. And as the brightest Sun wanteth not fuell to yeild increase to his glorious light: so there is not wanting in me a sufficient will, to do you all possible du∣tie and seruice (by which two, the Scutchion of my zeale is and shall for euer be supported) Thus more then halfe assured, that this my poore Booke shall finde shelture to flie vnder the shadow of your wing, in whose good grace (if once it be armed) I force not what back-biting Momus or his currish mates can imagine against it. And as these (my Premities, patronized by you) shall seeme pleasing: so wil I alwaies be most readie (if any matter of more worth chance into my handes) to offer it vp in all dutie at your shrine: vntill when I take my leaue, pray∣ing God in this life to grace you with all happines, and in the other life withall blessednes.
Your Worships euer deuoted
P. T. G.
