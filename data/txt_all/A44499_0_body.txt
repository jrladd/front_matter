Beloved,
AT your motion and by your request these papers are become more pub∣like then was intended: not for any rare worth in them, but to satis∣fle your desire and esteem of them, which though at first I was more inclinable to, considering that they bear some testimony, though not much, against some spreading evils of these times, yet upon second thoughts I began to recoil, and should have contented my self with your private en∣jment of them, considering the plenty of books, and the slendernesse of what these contain, and what the temper of the world is, that they would be ready to laugh at and deride my doings, and accuse me of arrogancy and soolishnesse: of arregancy as if I sought to be known and taken notice of, of footishnesse in endeavouring it by (or in filling the world with) such dead discourses, and this had stifled it in its birth, and made it never for me to have seen the Sun in this way, had not my respect to you and your desire, made me to disregard these reasonings which yet it did with some reluctancy, while I further considered, that as my weakresse would provoke some to sleight the witnesse born against their evils, so my plainnesse might perhaps offend others, and engage them against me into some contentions, not which but their bettering and profit is my desire: but Gods will be done in it, he is a fr agent and can do all things, and oftentimes worketh by most unlikely means, and doth most good where least is expected. One talent put to the improvement may bring forth a second with is blessing on it, and though some may hart themselves, yet others more sober minded may happily pick something from it that may serve to their profit, yea, some perhaps may finde leisure to look on such a Paper who either want it for, or money to procure larger volumes: for your sakes then and for theirs I have adventu∣red it to publike censure.
And seeing you were so much his whose furerall this solemnized, To you it's meet∣est in the first place with these portions of himself he hath left surviving him, that I commend it, not to provoke you to renewed gries in thought of your lesse of him, but to stir you up to imitate his vertues in miding his gains by them May you his and yours be so minded hereby of his or those forer worthies saith and walkings, as thereby to be stirred up to receive embrace and where you have enbraced to hold fast the word and premises, and so to follow their vertuous footsteps in contempt of the world, and carnest pursuit of the promise rest as to live by saith and die in saith  I shall thank y labor brciy well bestowed, whose hearty prater is your prosperities, subscribing my self with my endeavours,
