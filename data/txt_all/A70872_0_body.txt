MAdame, Vouchsafe to owne and patronize
These Meditations, which did first arise
Within those walls, which your bright vertues grace,
And fitted were for that Mount Or∣gueil. high rockie place
The Poem's like the Subject, barren, rude,
Ʋncompt, yet wholsome to an heart renu'd:
Your kind acceptance will it crowne, and raise
Above its worth, and be the Poets Bayrs
Who for your Noble Favours whilst that hee
Remain'd close Prisoner, Exile in Jerse.
Sequestred from all friends accesse, shall rest
Whiles any sparkes of life stay in his Brest
