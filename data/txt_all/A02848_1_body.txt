YOu will thinke it strange Maister Dole∣man, that hauing lien these many yeares in quiet harbour frō the tempest of mens tongues, you should now feele a storme to breake vpon you; peraduenture you were perswaded (as euery one suffereth himselfe to be beguiled with desire) that this si∣lence did growe, eyther vpon acceptance of your opinion, or from insufficiencie to oppose against it. I assure you neither; but partly from contempt, and partly from feare. Th contempt proceeded from the manner of your writing, wherein you regarde not  but : not how eyther truly or pertinent∣ly, but how largelye you do wright: endeauouring nothing else, but eyther to abuse weake iudgements, or to feede the humors of such discontented persons, as wante o disgrace hath kept lower then they had set their swelling thoughts. The feare was occasioned by the nimble eare which lately was borne to the touche of this string: for which cause our English fugitiues did stand in some aduantage, in that they had free scope to publish whatsoeuer was agreeable to their pleasure; knowing right well, that their bookes could not be suppressed, and might not be answered.
It may be you will question, wherefore I haue not answered your second part: it is ready for you, but I haue not now thought fit to divulge the same; partly because it hath beene dealt in by some others; but principallie because I know not how conuenient it may seeme, to discusse such particulars, as with generall both liking and applause are now determined. I forbeare to expresse your true name; I haue reserued that to my answere to some cast Pamphlet which I expect you will cast forth against mee: and I make little doubt but to driue you in the end to such desperate extremi∣tie, as (with Achitophell) to sacrifice your selfe to your owne shame, because your mis∣chieuous counsaile hath not bin embraced.
