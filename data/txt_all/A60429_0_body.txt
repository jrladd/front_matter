TO you, my dearly beloved Lambs and Babes in Christ Jesus, chosen of God the Father before the Foundation of the Word; called to be Saints; sanctified with the living Truth in the inward parts; justified by him that is near; redeemed with the Blood of the new Covenant; glorified as a royal Diadem in the hand of the Father; preserved through believing and obedience, by the mighty Arm of unlimited Power; com∣passed about with Salvation; anointed with Oyl of Joy, and Gladness of Heart; who are beloved of my Soul, and the Joy of the whole Earth, who are chosen, and faithful and true; who through great Tribubation the Kingdom do come to receive; who have not loved your Lives unto the Death; who did once walk in the Shadow of Death; whose feet now come to be guided in the Way of Everlasting Peace, to whom the hand of the Father's infinite Love hath been reached forth, as unto tender Babes, who come to be born and nursed up by the Womb and the Paps that are free, which is the Mother of us all; who know the first-born, which is blessed for evermore; who are become the first Fruits unto God, and to the Lamb; who have received the Testimony of Jesus; who have washed your Robes in the Blood of the Lamb, and have received the fine Linnen, which is the Righteousness of God, and the Righteous∣ness of the Saints; whose Sins are done away forever; whose Naked∣ness is covered; who have put on the pure Robes, and are adorned as a Bride for her Husband; who are clothed with Righteousness, as with a Garment, and are all Glorious within, and are able to stand upon the Sea of Glass, mingled with Fire, and before the Throne, out of which proceeds Lightnings, and Thunders, and Voices; who have cast down all your Crowns at the fect of the Lamb, and come to wait on him forever and ever, who is King of Kings, and Lord
 of Lords, who is worthy of all Glory, and Honour, and Praise, and Thanks, and Obedience, and Dominion from all his for evermore.
The Salutation of me, the Prisoner of Jesus Christ, with my own hand, unto you, my dear Ones, unto whom at present my Bowels of Love from God the Father are poured forth, with whom I am in the Spirit of Love and Meekness, among whom I have passed through good Report and evil Report, yea, that which is not to be named, who am as one of the least, yet not the least in Love unto you, who are unto me as the Children of my own Bowels, bound up with me in the unspeakable Life of the Father, which from all the World is hid for evermore, where Life and Immortality dwelleth forever, and is daily felt by all you that abide faithful in the Obedience, and keep your Garments unspotted of the Flesh, abiding in the pure Fear and godly Humility, your Bread is continued, and your Waters are sure, and your Souls are made as a watered Gardn, and Peace and Life springs up in you, and you may delight your selves in Fatness, and find the replenishings from the Fountain of God's living Mercies, and grow up in the holy Life as Trees of Righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.
The Church of the first born are you come to be, the Pillar and Ground of Truth, made lively Stones, elect and precious, growing up a holy Building unto God the Father, who will dwell in you his holy Temple forever and ever, who are founded upon the elect, precious and Corner-stone, the sure Foundation, the Rock of Ages, the Light of the World, whose light is your life, which is shining forth unto the Sons of men, that they may see your good Works, which are wrought in and by you, and hear your seasoned words, which ministers Grace unto the Hearers, and answers Gods Witness in all, and makes for your Ad∣vantage, who are as Plants of Renown, a Habitation of Holiness, Vessels of Honour, Clusters of Grapes, who receive nourishment from the Vine, whose Fruit never fadeth, whose Rivers are never dry, whose Rayment never waxeth old, whose Glory never fadeth, whose strength is renewed as the Morning, your Dread is upon the People, and your Terror upon the Heathen; your Enemies are all as stubble before you, and your God in the midst of you is a consuming Fire; Dreadful is his Presence in you, unto all his and your Enemies, the Workers of Iniquity, who shall fall before you as the Grass that is cut down, and wither as the Blossom that is cut off; Paleness shall cover the faces of all
 your Enemies; before you shall all People be much pained; Sorrow shall take hold upon them in the Night-season; then shall the Arrows of the Lord reach into their Bowels; Astonishment of Heart shall be upon them, and they shall fly when none pursues; and be in Distress, and none shall deliver. Arise against them, O ye, my Lambs! in the strength of the Lord, who teacheth your hands to war, and your fing∣ers to fight; let the Beast be overturned forever, let the Whore have blood to drink; let her Merchant be spoiled forever, and all her Children dashed against the Stone, and broken to pieces as a Potters Vessel with the Power of the Light; let the Darts of your hands, who handle the Word of Life, strike through all the false Prophets, and reach unto the secrets of all their Hearts, to the renting open of their Chambers of Darkness, and the cutting down of the Enemies of the Most High; and fear not, let not your hands be slack, the Lord of Hosts goeth before you, the mighty God is in the midst of you, the shout of a King is among you, and your Weapons are not Carnal, but Spiritual, which will bring down their Holds, though never so strong.
And you who suffer in outward Bonds, and there in your place, according to your measures, bear your Testimony against the covetous Hirelings, who are the Merchants that belong to the great Whore, who have long fed at Jezables Table and have long deceived the sim∣ple: Oh! faint not in your long-suffering, the Lord God is with you, as you continue in patience and long-suffering, and you shall be crowned with Immortality forever, if you endure to the end; for the Cry of your Affliction is ascended up on high, and the Lord hath heard the Sigh∣ing of the needy, and a three-fold Reward will you at last receive, who endure to the end; For the Lord God of Life, who seeth in secret, is sc∣cretly undermining the very Foundations of all Sions Enemies, and bringing Deliverance unto the Captives in a Way that hath not been known; that unto you, O ye afflicted Ones! may Deliverance come, not by might, nor by strength of man, but by the mighty Arm of Gods Power, which in due time will bring Deliverance unto all the dear Lambs of Christ, who this day stand faithful in the Innocent sufferings.
And all you who are yet but young and tender, abide you all in Meek∣ness, Lowliness Diligence and Faithfulness, without murmuring at them that are growing up before you; and let no Root of Bitterness
 spring up among any of you, I beseech you in the Bowels of the Lord Jesus Christ.
And all you that are grown up into the Understanding of Holiness, walk you all in the Life of God, and let that guide you in God's Wis∣dom, as Examples to the Flock, among whom you are placed, not as Lords, to rule with any thing in the Will, but in Tenderness to serve the least Member, that it may be preserved, that all may grow up a holy Building unto God the Father, To whom be all Glory forever and ever.
The Blessing of the Lord be upon you, and the Power of the Most High overshadow you, that you may spring forth as the Rose in Summer, and be fruitful as the Vine in its Season.
