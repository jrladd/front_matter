THe worthiest Subjects (as the Sages say)
Be those who be their Countries joyfull stay
Which Gods due glory, next their Princes Fame
And these three marks do make their best blest ayme;
How well's your worth approv'd to God and Man,
Our Church, our King, our Kingdomes witnesse can,
How well your life doth hit this triple white,
Whose Goodnesse, Gravenesse, Greatnesse, all delight
May that bright name shine uneclipsed here
Whom all his Country justly holds most deere;
Whom Heaven hath stellified for's Piety,
Whom his great King loves for's loyalty.
O may this threefold twist be nere untwin'd,
Long may Learning of you a sure friend find.
May Honors Pinnace Fames swolne sayles admit,
Tackled with merit, Piloted with wit.
That as you God, God may you ever honor,
The while you fight under Faiths sacred Banner.
That as you grace your King, your King may grace you,
Your God, your King, your Countrey may embrace you,
With humble heart and voyce thus sayes, thus prayes,
Who in devout admiring rest alwayes.
