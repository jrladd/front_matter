BEhold now (most Illustrious Prince, and most ho∣norable Prelate!) the rest of the books of Occult Philosophy, or Magick, which I promised Your Worthiness that I would put forth when I publish∣ed the first of them: but the suddain, and almost unexpected death of holy Margaret of Austria my Princess coming upon it, hindred me then from the endavoring to put it forth. Then the wickedness of some Pulpit-sycophants, and of some School-Sophisters incessantly raging against me for a de∣clamation I put forth concerning the Vanity of things, and the ex∣cellency of the word of God, and contending against me continually with bitter hatred, envy, malice, and calumnies, hindred me from putting of it forth; whereof some very proudly, with a full mouth, and loud voice aspersed me with impiety in the Temple amongst a promiscuous people. Others with corner-whisperings from house to house, street by street, did fill the ears of the ignorant with my infamy: others in publike, and private assemblies did instigate Prelates, Princes, and Caesar himself against me. Hence I began to be at a stand, whether I should put forth the rest of the book or no, whilest I did doubt that I should by this means expose my self to greater calumnies, and as it were cast my self out of the smoke into the fire, a certain rude fear seised upon me, least by put∣ting them forth I should seem more offensive then officious to you,

and expose your highness to the envy of malicious Carpers, and tongues of detracters. Whilest these things troubled me with a various desparation, the quickness of your understanding, exact discretion, uprightness of Judgement, Religion without superstiti∣on, and other most known vertues in you, your authority, and in∣tegrity beyond exception, which can easily check and bridle the tongues of slanderers, removed my doubting, and inforced me to set upon that again more bodly, which I had almost left off by reason of despaire. Therefore (most Illustrious Prince) take in good part this second book of Occult Philosophy, in which we shew the mysteries of the Celestiall Magick, all things being opened, and manifested, which experienced antiquity makes relation of, and which came to my knowledge, that the secrets of Celestiall Magick (hitherto neglected, and not fully apprehended by men of latter times) may with your portection be by me, after the shewing of na∣turall vertues, proposed to them that are studious, and curious of these secrets: by which let him that shall be profited and receive benefit give you the thanks, who have been the occasion of this Edition, and setting of it at liberty to be seen abroad.
Farewell.
