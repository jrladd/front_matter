Worshipfull Sir,
THe due respect I beare vnto your worth, and the thankes I owe vnto you for the many

arguments of your loue, and in∣couragemēts of my studies which I haue receyued from you, were the maine motiues that induced mee to tender vnto your accep∣tance, and to commit vnto your patronage this little Pamphlet and Alpha of my endeauours: Let me entreat your goodnesse to enter∣taine it. It consisteth of two dis∣courses, vpon the Natiuitie and Passion of our Sauiour. The Mat∣ter thereof is as he spake of the yron, borrowed: the Language is our owne. That wherein they both concenter and agree, is no lesse then CHRIST; then whom there is no greater, no better. For if the pursuite of anie thing be∣sides the happinesse of Heauen be still without end, and neuer with∣out danger: then may wee bee fully ascertained, that CHRIST a∣lone

is the chiefest obiect, where∣on we may fixe the eye of our per∣petuall contemplation, and em∣brace him with the armes of our deuoutest Affection: who is a Load-starre to direct vs vnto Hea∣uen. I will not so much preiudi∣cate your zealous intentions, as to perswade you to reade what I haue written: but rather to pardon, if I haue written amisse.
Thus am I still iealous of mine owne errours and inability, bee∣ing no lesse desirous to submitte my selfe vnto your iudicious cen∣sure: hoping that hereafter I shall addresse my selfe vnto the per∣fecting of some larger proiect: yet euer acknowledging that you deserue more then I can performe, and that you haue performed more then I can deserue. And therefore euer consecrating vnto

you both my paines and my pray∣ers: the one for your ser∣uice, and the other for your safety:
