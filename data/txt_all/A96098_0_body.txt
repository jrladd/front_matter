HONOURED FRIEND!
IT was not my intention when I preach'd this Sermon, that it should go any further then the Pulpit; But seeing you were plea∣sed to request me to print it, that I might herein gratifie your desire, and exhibit a testimonial of that respect which I did bear to your deceased Husband, I was willing to make it more publick, and the Lord make it profi∣table. You are sensible enough, I doubt not, of the late losse you have susteined, I did therefore choose to treat on this subject, that I might re∣vive you with the hope of future gain: not forgetting that of Solomon, Prov. 31. 6. Give wine to those that be of heavie hearts.
The Jewes have this forme of Speech at their Funerals, whereby they would chear up the par∣ty surviving; Let thy consolation bee in hea∣venSic consola∣tio tua in coeli. so I say to you, Look up to Heaven, let the Crown laidup comfort you The Lord help you to make a sanctified use of this sad stroke of Provi∣dence; learn (dear Friend) to make sure of Christ, when you cannot make sure of other relations. Faith will Contract you to CHRIST, and if your Maker bee your Husband,Isa. 54. 5. Death shall not dissolve, but perfect the Ʋnion: La∣bour still to Anchor within the vail,Hebr. 6. 9. 'tis no casting Anchor downward; wee break our earthly comforts while we lean too hard on them, but I must not expatiate. I have here presen∣ted you with the Sermon as I preach'd it, onely I have cast in some few additionals, which through straits of time I was then forced to omit. The blessing of the Almighty rest upon you, and let that golden Oil bee powred out upon your Posteritie. Ignatius ad Heronem.
