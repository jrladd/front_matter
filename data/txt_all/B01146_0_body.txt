Honorable Praetor:
THe Triumphes which these few leaues of paper, pre∣sent to your vew, (Albeit their glories are but short-liued as glittering onely for a day) Boldly show their faces vnto the eye of the world, as Seruants attending on your Lordship onely to doe you honor.
With much care, cost and curiosity are they brought forth; And, with exceeding greatnes of Loue, a free han∣ded bounty of their Purse, a Noble and generous Alacrity of Spirit, haue your worthy Fraternity, and much to be honored Brother-hood of Ironmongers, bestowed them vpon you.
It much winnes vpon them, to haue such a Cheife; and you cannot but be glad to haue such a Society: By a free Election are you Londons Praetor; The Suffrages of Commoners call you to your seate. A succession to the place, Takes you by the hand, your Industry hath met with Blessings, those blessings giuen you ability, and that ability makes you fit for a Maiestrate.
Yet there is a musicke in your owne bosome, whose strings
being touchd yeilds as harmonius a sound to you, as All theis: And that is, to see your selfe heire to that Patrician Dig∣nity with which your Father was Inuested. Jt was an ho∣nor to him to weare that Robe of Scarlet, It it a double glory to you, in so short an age to haue his sword borne be∣fore you.
You haue the voyce of Senators breathing out your wel∣come, A confluence of Graue Citizens, Adding state to your state, The acclamations of People, vshering you along. Whilst I (the least part of this Triumphant day) spend such sand as I haue to helpe to fill vp the houre glasse, my Ser∣uice ronning.
