Dear Madame,
I Present you the Notes tran∣scribed with mine own hand of the two Sermons preached be∣fore
 you, and your Honoura∣ble Husband at Fulbeck, where∣in I hope I have at once, both fulfilled mine owne promise, and satisfied your Ladiships de∣sire; they came unto me later then I purposed, but they are drawn out more fully and lar∣gely: according to the Ori∣ginal draught, as you heard them delivered. I doubt not of your favourable acceptance of them, such as they are. Your Honour will find, that amidst the whimsies of these times, this will prove a sure Card, to steer your course by unto the heavenly Jerusalem. There was more force and vigour I confesse, in the lively voyce, when you heard them; but you will find
 more opportunity to make use of them in a serious review, while you have them by you upon all occasions. As your hearts were warmed in the hearing of them at first, so I wish, that the living and quickening of the blessed spirit of God, may be on you, in the reading, and perusing of the same. My desire is, that the severall particulars of this short abstract out of Scripture, were written in your Noble heart, in golden characters; with the point of a Diamond. I humbly beseech your Ladiship, that your conversation may be a legible Expresse hereof before the world, to the comfort of your owne conscience, praying for the hap∣pinesse
 both Temporall and Eter∣nall, of you and yours. I re∣maine,
From Grantham. Sept. 9. 1654.
