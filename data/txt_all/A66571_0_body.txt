May it please your Grace,
IT was a saying of the late Earl of Ossory (Lord Deputy of Ireland (your Son) at what time he deliver'd up the Sword of that Kingdom to the Lord Lieutenant Berkeley) Action is the life of Go∣vernment: Common experience tells us, Usefulness, is the end of Action, and without which (like a Glass-eye to a Body) a man rather



takes up a room, than becomes any way serviceable. The sense of this, put me on those thoughts, I here∣with present your Grace, and un∣to whom more fitly, than to a Person, in the defence of which, few men sate longer at Helm, or suffer'd more; You, that hung not up your Shield of Faith, in the Temple of Despair, and never seem'd more worthy of the great place you now fill, than when far∣thest from it. Nor am I in the so doing, without some prospect of advantage to my self; in as much, as if the censuring Age, shall han∣dle me roughly on this account, under your great Patronage, I shall fight in the Shade.
And now (my Lord) I was just breaking off, when it came into my head, that I had, in some of



our late pieces, found Sir Edward Coke, often quoted, especially, to the defence of those Notions, which had better slept in their for∣gotten Embers; and therefore I thought it not altogether forein to the matter, that I us'd the words of S. Peter (2 Pet. 3.16.) touch∣ing S. Paul's Epistles, In which (saith he) are some things, hard to be under∣stood, which they that be unlearned, and unstable wrest, as also they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction: I have purposely made use of him in many places, as an high Asser∣tor of Monarchy, and Preroga∣tive; Those that find him other∣wise,
—Habeant secum, serventque—
Or let him lie indifferent, my Ar∣gument depends not singly on



him: which I humbly took leave to advert, and am,
