My Lord,
OF the Union of the two Kingdoms now happily intended, these being the Elaborate and most Learn∣ed Thoughts and Resolutions of that great States-man, yet more great

Lawyer, but most of all, the far great∣est Schollar of his Age and Nation, Sir Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, Vis∣count of St. Alban, presented to our sometimes Great SOVERAIGN, King James, the most Wise and Learned; I have advised them again to the Press, for the satisfaction of divers Noble and Worthy Persons, the Book in which they first came to light, being too voluminous for or∣dinary use, and rarely to be found in this Kingdom. And now, my Lord, I have made bold to give you the trouble of this Address, and pre∣sent these few Papers, though small in bulk, yet vast in matter, to your hands, both upon my own, and the Authors account. Upon mine own, who have ever been your most humble

Client, and have had your noble Friendship and Favour to counte∣nance me in all my private concerns: And moreover, you do as Chief Magistrate, govern that City in which I was first educate in the Peripatetick∣walks, and under, and in which, I have for divers years profest Letters, or practised Chyrurgery and Physick; and with the rest of my fellow Citi∣zens, have found such refreshment under your Shade and Care, that I thought it my duty to signifie it by this small testimony of my thankful∣ness. And I am sure, that upon the Authors account, there is not a fitter Person, to whom these Papers could be committed. The great prudence and knowledge he had in State Af∣fairs, made him very acceptable to

the Kings and People of his own Nation; and the great moderation, watchfulness and wisdom you have used in governing this City, one of the greatest Interests of this Kingdom, hath endeared you to all the Princes and Chiefs of this People. What la∣bour and trouble you put upon your self to preserve it under the late Usur∣pers, your very enemies do acknow∣ledge and praise. How your care and resolution preserved it from ruine, when the VVest Male-contents came marching to its very Gates, all that were faithful to His Majesties Service are ready to witness. And with what sweetness and calmness you have keep∣ed together the Union of the Bur∣gesses, who were ready, through heat and unadvisedness, to divide them∣selves,

your late appearance before the Right Honourable Committee of Trade, and your oppose to those that were ready to violate the old Sett of the Good-Town, is a testimony above exception. I could add many more evidences of your great Prudence and Moderation; but I will rather for∣bear them, then give the least blush or trouble to your modesty: Only this I must add, that as your Lord∣ship hath been a great Preserver of the Union of this Burgh; So I do not doubt, but you, who are the most eminent Member of a Party not least concerned in this Affair, I mean the Burroughs, will with your good advices, endeavour such an Union of the two Kingdoms, as shall most advance the Glory and Prerogative

of our Gracious King, and pro∣move most the Honour, Trade and Safety of both People. This and your Preservation, shall ever be the sincere Devotion of,
My Lord, Your most humble Servant,
