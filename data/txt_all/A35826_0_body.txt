May it please your Highness;
YOUR near Relation to the Imperial Crown of England, whence those HONORS compris'd in this ensuing Treatise are deriv'd, in∣duced
 me, with all Submissive Deference, to lay these First-fruits of my poor Endeavours at Your Highnesses Feet, as an humble Ob∣lation of my Dutiful Service, in a modest Assurance of Your Fa∣vourable Acceptance and Patro∣nage; an Encouragement able to put Life into the Meanest Un∣dertaker, and without which it must never have appear'd in Public, the Author being every way too Inconsiderable to afford it the least Protection.
The much-lov'd Name of Favourite GLOUCESTER, is alone sufficient to Guard it
 against the Censures of the Pre∣judic'd and Envious, who, thro' a lazy Malignity, decry many very Useful Performances, rather than take the Pains of out-doing 'em by any Commendable At∣tempts of their Own.
That Noble Disposition and Generous Condescension, Mighty PRINCE, so eminently Conspi∣cuous in Your Highness, is too well Known, and justly Celebra∣ted, to receive an Additional Lustre from any faint Enco∣miums of mine: I shall there∣fore readily acknowledge my own Inability, by declining the
 Custom of such Addresses, and on∣ly Presume to make it my Con∣stant and most Ardent Prayer, That Your Great Birth and Glo∣rious Endowments may be further Ennobled by Your yet Greater and more Glorious Atchieve∣ments; And that, as You are now in Your Blooming Youth, the Dar∣ling Object of Great Britain's most Promising Hopes, so, in Your Riper Age, You may be the De∣lightful Subject of its Loftiest Pa∣negyrics, and Europe's united Admiration: That so, after You've attain'd the Highest Step of Earthly Grandeur, and nume∣rous
 Years prosperously enjoy'd the Happy Honor, You may from thence have the easier Ascent to a Celestial Throne: Which, as 'tis the NATIONS Universal Wish, shall in a more especial manner be sincerely offer'd up to Heaven by,
Illustrious SIR,
