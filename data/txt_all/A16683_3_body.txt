IF promise be, as it is said to be
A Debt, you may expect the like of me;
Which tho it be not pai'd, it shall be don
And then your quittance for my Corydon.
Receiue him Sr. for trust mee hee's your owne,
And one that will be knowne where you are known;
Whom if you cherish (as I hope you will)
From yeare to yeare hee'le better's running still,
And grow in time to be a Dogge of prize,
And scorne to spend his mouth in common cries;
For time will come (as I perswaded am)
When hee'le be heard and hallow'd too of Pan.
