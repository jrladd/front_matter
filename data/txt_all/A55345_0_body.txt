MY LORD,
SINCE I must ac∣knowledg, that of all men in the World, I am

the most unfit to speak such great Things, as the following Relation doth justly challenge; I was in some suspence, whether I should lay it at your Feet, for Patronage, or Par∣don. But being Conscious that I have performed it very ill, and that it may fall into some other hands, that may think so too, I

must humbly beg them both. I shall most willing∣ly confess, that for the same Reasons I blame the writing, I ought to have foreborn the Impression; because Folly is the more excusable when it dwells within its own Retire∣ments, and goes not abroad to give others the Trouble, or Occasion of a freer and

more publick Censure. But I have sent it forth with my own Condemnation; and shall only Beseech Your Lordship to expound the Mistake, as a Testimony of that value I had for the Countess of Devon∣shires Memory, and Ver∣tues. And having named to Your Lordship, that Dear and Honourable La∣dy,

I may rest assured, that for the sake of that Re∣lation, the following Ac∣count hath to Her, it must have also a kind Re∣ception from You; if it be, but for those Regards the thing it self hath to Your Mother. And then I am the less concerned what Fortune I meet withall from others; since I did

not intend it as a Strata∣gem for Applause, but as plain Relation of the great Merits of a Personage, that ought to be Dear to Your Lordship; and of such Worthiness that Renders her mighty valuable to all others. And though, I have failed in giving just Accounts of her Vertues (which were in themselves

the greatest) yet I have at least signified what should have been said by
My Lord,
