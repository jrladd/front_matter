MADAM,
I present you vvith this translation, not to remaine in your hāds, but through them to pass vn∣to the publick. So shal it dou∣bly
bee aduantaged: First, more gratefully accepted of, comming immediatly from one so worthy as your self, and next be beleeued worthie the acceptation, that J dare offer it to your sight, so wel verst in at the Original Languages. So, Madam, goe my obligations multi∣plying to the Jnfinite, whilst J cannot think of paying you one curtesy but I receiue for it two; The whilst I must euer remaine.
