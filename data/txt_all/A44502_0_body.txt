SInce you are pleased, our of your love to the De∣ceased, and to the mat∣s herein contained, by your




benign and friendly hand to do the office of a Midwife to this my conception, to help to bring it into this World, which other∣wise had either proved, as to that abortive, or stuck longer in th Birth; I think it but meet and reasonable that your name also be put upon its front: and that your love both to the Truth, & t the Deceased for the truths sake should be therein acknowledged God give his blessing with it, tha you, and many others may hav good thereby, and that I ma not labour in vain, and by you help bring forth this fruit there of for trouble, but for edifica∣tion and benefit to many; and that the seed you have sow
thereabouts, may also bring forth fruit upon your account in he day of the Lord Jesus Christ, hat so you may never have cause o repent you of it. And the Lord recompence all your love nd labour of love to the De∣eased (as also I wish and desire for that very kind and loving Friend and Brother to him, at whose house he died, Mr. R. John∣on, and all other his Friends) nto your bosomes, and fill you, nd all that name the Name of Christ with an abundance of his pirit, and of the fruits of his ghteousness; that you and they ay, in the Heavenly and glori∣ous Kingdome hereafter Shine as e brightness of the Firmament,
and as the Stars for ever and ever. So desireth and prayeth for you and them,
Sister, 
At my House in Lin Regis Au∣gust 13. 1672.
