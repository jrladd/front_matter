My Lord,
THe occasion of this Sermon, which but rarely happen's, having per∣swaded me to the publishing of it; The extraordinary favours which I have con∣stantly received from your Lordship, will, I hope, excuse the prefixing so great a Name to so inconsiderable a Paper. I humbly beg, that it may be ac∣cepted
as a testimony of my Sincere acknowledgments and that the innocent Design hereof may not be denyed the Protection of so Revered a Sanctu∣ary.
