MAnie men (right Honou∣rable) when they intend some euil, I meane when they haue resolued free∣ly and boldly to trade in some sinne without check and control∣ment, doe seeke to shroude themselues vnder the cloth and countenaunce of some great persons of Worship and Honour. If my purpose or practise were such, I might iustly feare to bee
crossed and cursed in this my enter∣prise. The searcher of all hearts know∣eth, that my purpose, prayers, and en∣deuours (through his gracious assi∣stance) are, and shall bee, to keepe a good conscience in my ministerie, to walke in the vprightnesse of my heart, and to bee kept blamelesse to the com∣ming of Iesus Christ. In this resolu∣tion, may it seeme good vnto your Ho∣nour, as you haue alreadie (at the ear∣nest and humble sute of manie my ve∣rie good and worshipfull friends) re∣ceiued me to fauour: so still to conti∣nue your most honourable protection for my further encouragement in well doing. May it also please your ho∣nourable and religious disposition, to comfort and countenaunce this Mite, and small measure of comfort, which according to grace receiued, I haue once addressed, and now the second time published, and enlarged for the reliefe of such as grieue and groane vnder the heauie but then of their sinnes. Behold I presume to present it vnto your Ho∣nour as the best present I haue, to testi∣fie my humble dutie, seruice, and thank∣fulnesse.
And if by Gods good fauour and blessing there shall be ame one sen∣tence, worde, syllable, or letter, which may bring, or adde comfort to you or yours, I shall be occasioned the rather, heartily to blesse God for so great mer∣cie, and to pray more instantly, that your Honour may be blessed for euer.
