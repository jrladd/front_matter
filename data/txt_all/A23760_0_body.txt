Mr. GARTHVVAIT.
YOu needed not any
Intercession to recom∣mend
this task to me, which
brought its Invitations and
Reward with it. I very
willingly Read over all the
sheets, both of the Dis∣course,
and the Devotions an∣next,
and find great cause to
bless God for both, not dis∣cerning
what is wanting in
any part of either, to render
it with Gods blessing, most

sufficient, and proper to the
great End designed, the Spi∣ritual
supplies and advanta∣ges
of all those that shall be
exercised therein. The sub∣ject
matter of it, is indeed,
what the Title undertakes,
The whole Duty of Man, Set
down in all the Branches,
with those advantages of
brevity and Partitions, to in∣vite,
and support, and en∣gage
the Reader, That Con∣descension
to the meanest
capacities, but with all, That
weight of Spiritual Argu∣ments,
wherein the best pro∣ficients
will be glad to be as∣sisted,

that it seems to me e∣qually
fitted for both sorts of
Readers, which shall bring
with them a sincere desire of
their own, either present or
future advantages. The De∣votion
part in the conclusion
is no way inferior, being a
most seasonable aid to every
mans infirmities, and hath
extended it self very parti∣cularly
to all our principal
concernments; The Introdu∣ction
hath supplyed the place
of a Preface, which you seem
to desire from me, and leaves
me no more to add, but my
Prayers to God, That the

Author which hath taken
care to conveigh so liberal
an Alms to the Corban so
secretly, may not miss to be
rewarded openly, in the vi∣sible
power and benefit of
this work, on the hearts of
the whole Nation, which
was never in more need of
such supplies, as are here af∣forded.
That His Allsuffici∣ent
Grace will bless the seed
sown, and give an abundant
encrease, is the humblest re∣quest
of
March 7. 1657.
