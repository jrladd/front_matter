Encrease of glory.
MOre thē much beloued when god brought man forth at the first he put him not into a vvildernes, but into a garden, a paradise, & place of pleasure wherby I see that his sacred maiestie did not reioyce in the misery, but in the delight & happines of his creatures. Cheere∣fulnes therefore pleaseth god

better then dulnes,  & heauines of hart. Let vs be▪ godly, & good in our pleasures, & it vvill neuer displease our maker) neither vvill he grudge, or repin at our ioy. To this purpose haue I framed certayne hymns for th priuat solace of such as shall take delight there in. One portion vvhereof I haue consecrated to you▪ Let yt haue acceptance of you by your practice of yt▪ I expect  other guerdon for my paines. For the highest knovves vvith vvhat an honest hart I composed this, & the rest, & vvhat a desire I had in the framing thereof for the good of many. I haue euer hated epi∣curean resolution▪ Let vs eate, & drinke to morrovve vve shall dye. But I haue euer loued entyre  exhortacion. Let 

vs pray, & praise god, To mor∣rovve vve shall liue For to loue, is to liue, & vvhere vve loue, thee vve liue▪ If vve loue god, vve shall liue in him by our prayers, by our prayses, & all by one spirit. O then let vs so loue him, that vve may liue in him in our daylie voices, that they may be hard to his glory, our comfort, & good example of our brethren. The god of heauen ioy your art in all your life, & in your death that vve may all meete to sing together in the quire of heauen vvith the angells in the sauing mercies of our Sauiour Christ.
