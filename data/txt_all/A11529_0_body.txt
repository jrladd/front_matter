INgratitude or vnthankefulnes for be∣nefits receiued (right worshipfull) is, and euer hath beene a thing so lothsom and vile to men of good minds, that (among some nations) they haue set downe lawes and ordinances to punish the offenders therein, so hard and sharpe, that those that haue beene found within the compasse of the same, haue suffered no lesse then losse of life: yea more then this, the verie brute beasts haue so much loathed this horrible vice, that they according to the instincti∣on of nature, haue shewed themselues (in this respect) more indifferent then some men: as it is reported in Gueuarra his workes, of a Lion, who finding in his den a fugitiue bondman that was fled from his mai∣ster, a Romaine Proconsul, dwelling in the confines of the desarts of Aegipt, hauing hurt his foote with a thorne which he had gotten roming vp and downe seeking his praie, suffered the same to be lanced, cut, and cured by this fugitiue, so that within short space it was throughlie whole and well. This poore man although he dwelt quietlie with his new found hoast, and might also vse and take such as he got in the wil∣dernesse, yet louing libertie, on a time gt foorth of the
 den, and being seene of the espials which his maister had laide for him, was by them taken and brought to him, who caused him to be sent to Rome, to be tor∣mented among other condemned men, at such time as the Emperour should make anie solemne feast or tri∣umph. It fortuned afterward, this same Lion to be ta∣ken and sent also to Rome, to be there kept among o∣ther sauadge and wilde beasts. Not long after this, the same condemned bondman, was amongst others ap∣pointed also to the slaughter, & brought into the field called Campus Circulus, to trie his fortune with some wild beast, and to conclude, it was his good hap to in∣counter with that Lion which hee before had cured: Assoone as this hungrie ramping Lion had espied that man, as one desirous of his praie, he ran towards him to haue deuoured him, but when hee perceiued well that he was the verie man that had lodged with him in his den, and done him good, he straightwaie stood ouer the man, defending him from the crueltie of anie other beast. When the man who exspected nothing but death, had well considered the humanitie of the beast, and throughlie regarded him, he was then assu∣red that it was his quondam hoste in the deserts, and therevpon made the bolder to touch him, and so stro∣ked and cherished him. The Emperour and the whole state of Rome stood still, abashed at this strange & rare sight, and after a little staie made, caused to be inquired of the man, whether he were a Nigromancer, or whe∣ther he had inchanted the Lion, seeing that he was hunger-prickt, and yet had no power to hurt him: to this he answered, that his safetie came by the gentle∣nesse of the beast, and not of anie power of his owne, and reported at large the cause of that clemencie, as be∣fore
 is expressed. To be short, the man had his life, and licence to beg vp and downe the streets of Rome, leading the Lion in his hand, vpon whose breast was written as followeth. Hic Leo est hospes, huius hominis. and in the forepart of his coate was set downe, Hic homo est medicus huius Leonis. To auoid this horrible sinne, I haue (Right worshipfull) presumed to dedicate vnto your worship, the true reports of my troubles, & of certeine others in Turkie, which although they be not set out with braue termes, yet is in them set downe nothing but plaine troth, easie to be told, but hard to be tollera∣ted: beseeching your worship, as frēdlie to accept of the same, as I willinglie present it, which if it were answe∣rable to my desires, should then signifie what heart I carrie to your worship, vnto whom I confesse my selfe most wholie bounden, and least my rude speeches should sauor of flatterie. I here leaue your worship to the Almigh∣tie, who send you health and heauen.
