SIR,
THere are but three reasons indu∣cing
an Author to dedicate his
Book to any one man, rather
than to another: The first is
the patronage of his Work, under the
shelter of some o're-spreading tree, whose
armes may happily receive the suppliant
under his protection, and defend it from
the stormes of persecution. The second is
a willingnesse in the Author, to expresse a
Gratitude by Dedication, by reason of some
former Courtesies received. And the
third is a fitnesse in the person to whom he
dedicates his book, whereby his dedication
may become suitable to such a Patronage.
The first I never affected, as never be∣lieving
that the estimation of any Patron
could be o sufficient authority to dignifie
the patronage, if it had not that within it
selfe to make it acceptable, according to
that expression of the Father of the En∣glish
Poets, vz. I never knew that a Ge∣neralls
Oration could make an Army
either stand or fall, but look how much
habituall valour each man hath in him∣self,
so much in act it shews.
The Second I alwaies loved, viz. to be
gratefull to my friends, and where such
love and gratitude cannot otherwise goe
or stand upon their owne legs on any
ground, they shall both creep on paper;
wherefore, most worthy Cousin, having
received so great a benefit (at your hands
beyond the Seas) as in my low condition,
not onely at once to relieve the Father in
his necessity, but also to adde so bountifull
a hand in the bringing up of that child,
which by you speciall charity is now able
to live of it selfe, to you onely do I dedi∣cate
this book as an acknowledgement of
all your loving kindnesses.
Nor is the dedication of the History (of
this renowned Bishop and Cardinall elect)
to your selfe altogether improper for you,
being a Merchant your selfe, he being a
Merchants Son, whereby it may appeare,
that men of your profession do not altoge∣ther
bring home, together with your Gold,
from Ophir, Apes, and Peacocks fea∣thers,
but sometimes Iewels of Divine
verity, and highest estimation. Thus
with my prayers to God for you, and your
continuance in his Grace and Favour, till
you reach his Glory, I take leave to rest,
