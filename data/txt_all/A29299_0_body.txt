May it please your Grace,
DEdications are now be∣come
so necessary, that
such Books as appear
without them, meet with the
same Fate as Men abandoned
by their Tutelar Angels,
Scorned and Neglected, not
thought capable of entertain∣ing,

nor worthy to be lookt
upon; but when addressed,
the more illustrious Patronage
is, the greater is the Opinion
of tbem, and the more kindly
are they received. These rea∣sons
have caused several to
present you, Madam, with
Works of this kind, and have
Obliged me to make your
Grace an Offering of this A∣musement.
I could never
have hoped to have procured
Pardon for this Presumption,
if that your goodness were not
known to be infinite, and that
your Grace being generally ac∣knowledged
to be the best
Judge of these sort of Pro∣Productions,

I fancied it
would have been injurious to
your Prerogative to have offe∣red
them, and sought else∣where
for Protection, and that
it had been as great a Crime,
as for a Subject to have done
homage to any other than His
true Soveraign.
These, Madam, were the
incitement, to the Ambition
of having your Grace at the
head of this Translation,
whose only name is a perfect
Elogy, and though without
the Attendance of those vast
Advantages of Birth and
Fortune, which your Grace
possesses in the highest Degree,

would still have been the grea∣test
and most admirable Per∣son
in the World, by what
You have received from Na∣ture.
Writers now flock to You,
Madam, as to the Fountain
of all Perfections, not only
to be own'd and countenanc'd,
but also to copy and admire
those Excellencies, which the
Most Famous Princesses of the
World have been celebrated
for, and which so abound in
Your Grace, that there needs
no more to the Composing the
Compleatest Panagyrick, than
to say, the Dutchess of Al∣bemarle,
in which Words

are comprehended all those
Extraordinary Qualities,
which all the Earth have
ever had in Veneration. So
glorious a Prospect firing me
with the Zeal and Pride of
laying this Piece at Your Gra∣ces
Feet, I humbly beg it's ac∣ceptance,
and leave to declare
the most Profound Respect,
with which I am,
May it please your Grace,
