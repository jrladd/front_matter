Madam,
IF Sophonisba receiv'd some ap∣plause upon the stage, I arro∣gate nothing from the merit of the Poem, but as I ought with the humblest acknowledgments and profoundest gratitude, impute it to the favourable aspects of the Court-Stars. But above all, I must pay my adora∣tions to your Grace, who as you are the most Beautiful, as well in the bright appear∣ances of body, as in the immortal splendors

of an elevated soul; did shed mightier in∣fluence, and darted on me a largess of glory answerable to your stock of Beams. Han∣nibal himself whose hardie spirit never bowd but to the fair imperious Rosalinda: nay, he who in spite of beauties charms, durst gaze upon that sun with Eagle-eyes, and tax her with a blemish, now making his approaches to your Grace, seems awed with the source of so many rayes, and dazl'd with a presence so illustrious. He sees with new bleedings, eyes more attractive than those of Rosalinda, somthing more delicate in your shape, and lofty in your meen; an Air so charming sweet, that 'tis miraculous it shou'd be Majestick too: Smiles of more delightful Shine than April suns, such softnesses and languishings, as the almigh∣ty Poets hand cannot describe, nor Pain∣ter's Pencil ever draw. For my own part

I am resolv'd to look up to you daily, and de∣dicate my Life and Labours to your Grace, to spend all the store of my yet unexhaust∣ed fancy in your unbounded Fame. For I declare to be wreath'd in Lawrel from head to foot, is not comparable honour to that of being Madam.
