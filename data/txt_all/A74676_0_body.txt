Reverend SIR,
THese few Dis∣courses, which (next to their being Gods Sacred
Truth) derive all their Worth, from your vouchsafing an Ac∣ceptance of them, had not seen the light, un∣less you had cast a smiling Aspect upon them and their Au∣thor.Eccl. 1.7. The grate∣full Rivers acknow∣ledg their Homage, by sending their Streams to the Ocean from whence they were re∣ceived.
Dumb Creatures
teach me to speak, and thankfully to acknow∣ledge, That next to God, you are One, to whom I owe what I have or can do. You have been the Con∣duit, through which he hath conveyed much good to my outward, many Mer∣cies to my inward Man. I desire to praise him, to testifie my Thanks to you, by Devoting these
Meditations to His Honour, your Patro∣nage and Perusing. Let others commend their Patrons; desire of Praise, implieth weakness in the Sub∣ject; your Brighter Name stands not in need of such a shadow as mens Applause, to make it more Re∣nowned in the world. Native Worth is ever more respected, than Adventitious Glory:
Yet excuse me, if I say you are one who in these last dayes, de∣light to Meditate of the last things, who in these worst dayes, put not the evil day far from you, or him who presents it to your view. Your Acceptance of these Papers, doth make them more welcome to those who are look∣ing Sion-ward, and doth encourage him
in what may promote his own or their jour∣ney thither: who is
St. Johns Col: Camb. March 30. 1657.
