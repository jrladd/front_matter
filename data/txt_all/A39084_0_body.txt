COpies, with what Art and Delicacy soever they may be taken, never attain to the Worth and Accuracy of the Original, unless the Original it self had been drawn by an unskilful, or a partial hand, and then its fail∣ings and imperfections may be rectified by the Copyer; but to

Copy from a sophisticated Copy, of a sorry Original, is the Devil, and this has happened in the late Translation of the History of the Buccaniers, which being written originally in the Dutch, with a French-mans name, for the Author cannot be thought otherwise than counterband Ware. For the French were never found to be over-rea∣dy to learn other Languages, and especially for one to make choice to express himself in so harsh an one as Dutch, rather than in his Mother Tongue, is a Miracle. Wherefore the Dutch Relation it self may reasonably be supposed to have been jobbled up between a French-man and a Hollander, the first furnishing the Matter, and the latter the Disposition and Orna∣ments.

Now who can other∣wise think but these two would glory over, and extol their own Nations as much as possibly they could; we having never found either Nation so over-conscien∣cious, but that their Historians were always ready to put the In∣tegrity and Impartiality due and requisite to the Title upon the stretch, rather than their Country∣men should suffer by a plain and faithful Representation. Now a Piece delineated by such suspi∣cious hands, to be afterwards drawn by a Spaniard, who is no less jealous of, and zealous for the Honour of his Nation, must infallibly have its truth and pro∣bity a little tainted. Thus we must of necessity conclude, that a

man must have abandoned his Reason, who gives entire Credit to such a spurious Relation, and to have delivered up his Sense and Experience as a prey to Cre∣dulity and Imposture. This the Publisher of the following Sheets was sensible of, and therefore though he knew both the Dutch Original and the Spanish Transla∣tion contained most excellent Re∣marks in point of Natural Histo∣ry, with several Observations never before extant upon that Province. He thought not fit to prosecute his Design of having them rendred into the English Tongue, before that he had had them stand the Test of such who had resided many years in those Parts, and, as it were, been pre∣sent

at, and Eye-witnesses of those Pyratical Expeditions, and so were fully acquainted with the Interests and Affairs of our Buc∣caniers; these Gentlemen were pleased to correct, purge and re∣form it of many Abuses and Mistakes, wherewith this Ac∣count was sullied by Self-interes∣sed Pens; so as Reader, you have here the History of the Buccaniers exposed open before you, and in a condition to undergo the most impartial View and Scrutiny. Yes, you have it here prun'd of all those Tautologies wherewith the other Accounts are loaded, which is in∣deed, as the Hollander says, Veel Spreken en niet seggen. But the merit of these Sheets does not only consist in Abbreviation and Conciseness,

but the Reader will quickly find how much more it is to be valued than a slavish, a superstitious draft of so Erroneous a Translation as is that of the Spanish, which has en∣deavoured to pourtraict the Spa∣niards more mild and favourable, and the Buccaniers more cruel and barbarous than they really were. And here I cannot forbear putting the Reader in mind of God's just Judgment upon the Spaniards for their inhumane usage of the poor and miserable Native Indians, and look upon our Coun∣try-men, how horrid soever some of their Actions may have been, as Instruments of the Divine Ven∣geance for the punishing those e∣normous Crimes, and unparallel'd Barbarities committed by that Na∣tion

upon a naked, defenceless sort∣of People, and whose only Crime in their Eyes was their Riches, and so Destruction was pull'd upon them by the goodness and plenty of their Possessions. And I must needs add, that how home and real soever may be the Accu∣sations of our Buccaniers Inhuma∣nity and Barbarism, yet that they are but meer Infants, meer Novi∣ces in Cruelty, in comparison of the Spaniards; witness all Relations of their American Conquests, which even all the Artifice of Priest-craft, and the plausible pretence of Religion has not been able to var∣nish over.
Having thus cleared this Ac∣count of all the filth and ordures, wherewith this Account was poi∣soned

and infected, I do not que∣stion but that I may safely assert this Piece to be as agreeable to, and as necessary for an English Reader, as any this Age has pro∣duc'd, it thoroughly acquainting us with the Lives, Laws, and Man∣ners of the Buccaniers, they being for the most part our Country∣men, or at least the Bravest of them, who have distinguisht themselves in several occasions with that incredible Bravery and Gallantry, that their Great, Bold, and Generous Exploits in point of Military Conduct and Valour, are in no wise to be match'd by any Circumstances of the Expeditions of the most famous Conquerours of the Universe. And so far do they exceed the pitiful, sottish

Courage of a Town-Fop for aMi∣stress, or of our common English Highway-men, that their most sparkling, most illustrious Action seem guilty of Pusillanimity in comparison of those of our Buc∣caniers; for they had not to do with an Effeminate, Dastardly Degenerate sort of People, but with such as were spirited by their Religion, and fought pro Diis & Focis, and were Headed by brave Leaders, being commonly those who having perform'd extraordi∣nary Atchievements in the Spanish Dominions in Europe and Africa have afterwards Employment conferred upon them in the West-Indies, as a Reward for their Ser∣vices. But though the Spaniards have a sufficient stock of real Bra∣very,

yet they seldom miss of shewing it greater in their Words than in their Actions. Thus in the Translation into that Tongue, you find many flourishes that ought to have been left out, but which indeed are as easie to be known as a Child is by his Father, or as they themselves say,
Cada uno es hijo de sus obrus.
And indeed we may say that both the Dutch Author and Spanish Translator were both of a Herd in that respect, and as the Spa∣niard says,
Oncias bobas, for do va una van totas.
