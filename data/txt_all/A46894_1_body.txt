SIR,
I Have perused with much comfort
the Manuscript you sent mee; and
whereas you desire my opinion of it,
truly Sir, I must tell you, without
complement, that it is a very useful
& pious piece of devotion. Doubt∣lesse,
you were truly inspired, when you were compi∣ling
the work, and your soule had taken a high fight
towards her Creator, insomuch that one may finde
that you felt the joyes of heaven, while you were thus
meditating upon them.
This part of the Christian Common-wealth will be
much obliged to you for such materiall notions, and
strains of piety. For my particular, I must confesse
they affrded me much solace in this my sad conditi∣on,
for they raised my spirits to a great height of com∣fort,
and I am confident they will worke the same ef∣fect
in any soul that is susceptible of spirituall impres∣sion.
So, with my very kinde respects to my deare
friend, your kinsman, Major John Jackson, I rest.
From the Fleet this
11. of September.
