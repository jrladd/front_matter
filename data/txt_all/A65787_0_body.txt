Sir,
THe many attempts
you have this long
time made upon
me, to declare a
point of Philoso∣phy,
wherein partly I was igno∣rant,
and partly loth to meddle
(being mindefull of the Poets
admonition, Incedis per ignes
suppositos cineri doloso) have at
the last beaten out of my resi∣stance,
this little sparke of fire,

or rather light; borne by the
Authors intention, to shine, not
to burne. For, having by ex∣perience
of many our debates
upon single points, found that
such skirmishes were not like
to gaine the victory of satis∣faction
upon your so solid un∣derstanding;
I saw my selfe
forced to lay before your eyes,
in one Platforme or designe,
the most intimate and bottome
principles of Obedience and
Governement. The which, I
have strived to doe in the most
short and summary manner I
was able: not willing to bee
over-curious in so awfull a
subject. I play therefore the
pure Philosopher. I deliver

the abstract notions onely:
leaving to the prudence of par∣ticulars,
to draw such conse∣quences,
as every ones circum∣stances
shall make necessary
and evident unto him by the
short hints I give. And as for
your selfe, I doubt not but my
time is well employed. As
for others, I feare the fortune
of my other Writings, may
prove constant also to this;
that it will finde, those who
reade it not, or who cannot
judge of it, severe Censurers:
and those who like it, fearfull
to oppose so loud and clamo∣rous
a multitude; or at least,
stonned with the adverse noise.
But for this, let the eternall Pro∣vidence

care. To me such cla∣mours
will bee no novelties:
But the content of having gi∣ven
you satisfaction, an abun∣dant
reward of the endeavours
of
Sir,
