Encrease of Courage and Constancy of Spirit.
SIRS, Those who chose you unto your places of great trust and toyle might have justly (by nativenesse of soyle, expres∣sions of Love, and earnestnesse of desires) challenged the de∣dication; yet they being many, and you their representative body in an eminent and publike way, I hope it shall neither displease them or trouble you, that the ensuing Sermons doe passe under your names to the publike view: I wish them in their printing their happie successe in their preaching, they were words in season to the best, and words of vexation to the worst; Our ministry cannot please the one, but it must dis∣please the other; How ever its sit, that every one have his portion; It is my comfort that by the happie successe of the Gospell in the hearts of the people, Marlborough is a Towne honouring and cleaving fast to the Parliament; they chose not Burgesses either to disgrace or to desert them; neither you nor they come under the censure of Solon's Law to the Athenians who adjudged him to die, and unworthy to live that in time of civill Garboyles (as carelesse of the weale pub∣like) withdrew himselfe, and became a Neuter: As you have not been drawne into unfaithfulnesse by the ill examples of Revolters from their fidelity to their Country: so they have not beene betrayers of their owne liberties in joyning with any persons (thugh great in place) in any illegall courses of di∣vision twixt King and people.
If these Sermons had an influence on them, why may they
 not have an effect on you? The times are encreased in their troubles, the Cloud is growne blacker and bigger; some men are desperate, others despaire, most see their dangers, few can believe and hope for deliverance: Out of my generall respect to the Times Lamentation, and for the raising up of yours, with other mens spirits, under our sad conditions I have gathered up my scattered Meditations, which for substance are what I then delivered, though they have received their further additions.
Sirs, I will be no further troublesome to my selfe or you: know; that the eyes of many are upon you, the prayers of ma∣ny are for You, Nay there are more with you, then against you; as you have begun well, so end well, and the great God who is the King of Kings, even the supreame Iudge of all the world, hold up your spirits against all discouragements, and carry on your great works unto perfection, against all oppositi∣ons, giving unto you reward with himselfe, so daily prayeth for you,
