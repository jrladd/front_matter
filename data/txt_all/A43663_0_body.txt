Gentlemen.
ALtho' the Glory of God, which is the Subject of this Discourse, be the supream end of all Human Actions, yet it is very certain from many of the greatest
Pretenders to Religion, that they have obscure, perverse,, and incongrous No∣tions of it. And if what I have said upon it in this short compass may any way contribute to rectifie such mens apprehensions, I shall be thankful to God for it, and think my pains very well spent. I had presented you sooner with it, but that I was hindered by sundry Avocations; and perhaps had I published it, when you first de∣sired me, it might not have done so much Good amongst us, as now it may do in cooler times, when men are in a better temper, and more fit to mind both the concerns of this World, and
that which is to come. I wish you all happiness, and shall be ready to serve every one of you in particu∣lar, as I have all of you in general in first, Preaching, and now, Publishing this Discourse, which comes with all due respects from
Gentlemen,
