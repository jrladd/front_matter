Much honoured Madam,
KING Solomon, the wisest of men, having tyred him∣selfe in seeking to obtaine happinesse by the stu∣dies of learning, and know∣ledge,

and at last, finding that hee that encreaseth know∣ledge, encreaseth sorrow, hee turnes himselfe another way, and seeing the knowledge of the creatures could doe him no good, he thought to try what delight the use of them could bring unto him; in the pur∣suance whereof, hee gave not himselfe over to brutish, and unmanly pleasures, but to the free use of such creatures, as the Lord hath bestowed upon the sonnes of men, for their refreshing and delight: a¦mongst which hee reckons up gardens and Orchards stored with all sorts of fruits, and flowers: these hee might have enjoyed with much pro∣fit, and comfort, if hee had

used them aright, but seeking for happinesse in them, no such honey could be sucked out of the daintiest of those flow∣ers; no such wine out of the fruitfullest of those grapes: and therefore hee concludes, looking upon all the workes which his hands had wrought, that all was vanity and vexa∣tion of spirit. Eccles. 2.11.
Now as the Lord afforded unto him such choise delights: so he hath bestowed upon your Ladiship a confluence of out∣ward felicities; and amongst them Gardens (if I may guesse) not farre inferiour to Solomons: and those beau∣tified, and inameld with va∣riety of the choisest flowers, whose lively verdures, and

fragrant smels (if I mistake not) your Ladiship is much pleased with: yet herein I presume in a much different way from Solomons, as not seeking happinesse in them; but rather desiring by those objects to raise up your soule to such contemplations, as may truly further your eternall happinesse: and if your La∣diship shall find such heaven∣ly odours in those flowers, whose purest matter is the earth: and whose freshest beauty is so fading: what will you doe in a Nose-gay of flowers, whose matter is di∣vine; and whose smell, and beauty will never decay: Such anone I doe here humbly pre∣sent unto your Ladiship: you

may use it summer and win∣ter without feare of withe∣ring; yea, herein are flowers both for food and physick: for meats, and medecine. Length of time will no whit impaire, either the beauty or Vertue of them, and therefore they doe most transcendently excell all earthly flowers whatsoever: Indeed I must ingenuously confesse, that few of them grew upon mine owne soyle; yet before I could bind them together in this handfull, my labour was not small in wal∣king through so many Gar∣dens, out of which I have se∣lected them: neither as I hope will it be offensive, or prejudi∣ciall to the worthy Planters, and Owners of them (some of

which are with God, others now living) that I thus dis∣perse them abroad, them∣selves having first made them common: If your Ladiship please to vouchsafe your fa∣vourable acceptance of them, I doubt not but they will take the better with others; and if God may receive the glory, and his People benefit by these my labours, I shall have mine end, whose ambition it is to to be esteemed.
Alcester. Septem. 20. 1641.
