SIR, it is a point well knowne vnto your Worship, that in du∣ties of absolute neces∣sity wee must regard what God doth com∣mand and enioyne, not what men doe ap∣proue and like of: and that wee must still offer vp our seruice in obedience to the Almighty, whatsoeuer men doe thinke or speake of vs. As for this worke of publi∣shing the labours of such faithfull and painefull Ministers, as desire rather to spend their time in preaching, then in wri∣ting, I take it not to be a duty of that kind:
but of an inferiour nature; wherin the ac∣ceptance or disallowance of those that are godly wise, should haue a great stroke, either for encouragement to pro∣ceed in it, or for discouragement to desist from it. Herein hauing made some triall, I haue (through Gods blessing) found successe beyond my expectation: which as it ministreth vnto mee matter of much reioycing, in regard there are many thou∣sands in Israel, who desire and embrace the sincere & plaine doctrine of the Gos∣pell; so doth it set an edge on my desires to take vp some vacant houres in this im∣ployment: being right glad, if by any meanes I may bee an helper to the truth, and an instrument of refreshing hunger∣bitten soules, by conueying vnto them some baskets full of such fragments, as may bee communicated without any de∣triment or disaduantage to my selfe, or to any else. These Sermons I haue made bolde to recommend vnto your fauoura∣ble acceptance and patronage, not onely in regard of the interest which you haue
in them, and that encouragement which I haue often receiued from your Worship in businesses of this nature; but also be∣cause I perswade my selfe that your very countenancing of them, wil adde, though not vnto their goodnes, yet vnto their good esteeme, among many that are re∣ligiously affected.
And thus nothing doubting of your Worships fauour in taking in good worth this my bold attempt, I leaue you to the safe tuition of God Almighty, be∣seeching him to enrich you & yours with all manner of corporall and spiritual bles∣sings in Christ Iesus; and to adde vnto your life, as also vnto the life of your faithfull and gracious yoake-fellow, ma∣ny happy and comfortable daies.
