Deare Sir,
GIve me leave to pre∣sent you with a few meditations, which owe their birth to that place wherein your Honourable Father received his; and therefore by a kind of Alliance may seem to challenge your acceptance. The solemne retirements of those silent walks, gave life to these thoughts; which now under your name dare shew themselves abroad, and from the society of Groves and Ecchoes take the liberty of a more open
 view: They are not that which the world usually calls by the name of study (though heaven cannot be too much studied on) but the exercise only of a few spare thoughts some∣times, on a pious subject; a tribute, which no Godly mind can pay too often. And I was the more ambiti∣ous, they should receive the honour of their Dedication from your hand as being so well acquainted with your vertue, and the noblenesse of your spirit; which is already be∣come its owne Herauld, beyond the loudest Encomium my pen can give. Let Philosophers count the orbes and reckon up the starres, none can speak so feelingly of Hea∣ven as he that loves it best. Of all Knowledge, experimentall is the noblest; and of all Meditation, that which informs not onely the mind, but the manners too. The end of Di∣vine Contemplation is reformati∣on, and he is but a dry Christian whose life consists more in specu∣lation
 then in practise: and though I am no Preacher, yet I hope, with∣out putting me to the trouble of a Complementall excuse for being in print, you will pardon my ambi∣tion, if, desirous to acknowledg my engagements to your Noble Relati∣ons (as a testimony of my respects to your selfe) I have made choice of this, having no other way to ma∣nifest how much I desire to be e∣steemed,
SIR,

Oxford
Novemb. 1658.
