SIR,
IT was a very wise return that a Reverend Divine, now in being, made, when the Act of Uniformity was framing; Who being asked, What he intended to do: Answered, That if the Act was tolera∣ble, he would comply; and the reason was, because he dreaded Faction, not knowing when once he got into it, how far it would drive him, meaning, I suppose, that when men once come to think themselves hardly and unkindly treated by their Governors, and see the Encouragements of the Nation disposed of to others, whom they think not so truly worthy as them∣selves; this works such a discontent in them, as dispo∣ses
them to any Action or Opinion, whereby they may keep at the greatest distance from the Commands of Governors, and express their hatred both to their Per∣sons and Authority.
And, truly Sir, we have sadly seen this thing, that be feared of himself, come to pass in many others, and those who some years agone contested with the spirit of Separation, and both preached and wrote vigorously against the Principle from whence it took its birth and being, and denounced the heaviest Curses both of Heaven and Earth against all those who were Fau∣tors and Promotors of it; and now (I am afraid too much thorough a spirit of discontent and anger at the Government under which they live) baptized into the same Principles, and become Examples of the same Separation, which they condemned so violently, and with so great an heat in others, and cannot be content onely to meet and gather people from the seve∣ral Quarters both of City and Countrey, but they must choose the same time with those who are the onely le∣gally constituted Preachers; and that is not all, but they pitch in those places, and plant themselves in those streets, where they acknowledge the Parish Minister is worthy and laborious, and where they know there is Love and Ʋnity betwixt both the Pastor and his People.

And what this looks like, but revenge against the Government, and an obstinate resolution to do what in them lies to undermine the present Ministry, I cannot tell; a thing which I am sure the Puritans of old, whom they pretend to be followers of, would have disowned, and vehemently declaimed against.
Sir, The sad and serious consideration of this, was one occasion of bending my thoughts upon the follow∣ing Subject, after you had been pleased to give me an invitation to appear in so honourable and judicious an Assembly. And, in earnest, he that considers well what must needs be the Consequences of all this here∣after, be must necessarily vindicate any honest-hearted and true English-man, that stands up, and ac∣cording to the power he is invested with, endeavours to put a stop to these irregular proceedings. And those men who, notwithstanding all that can be said or urged to them from their former professed and avowed Practices and Principles, will yet so far countenance their rage and prejudice, as to continue in this unseasonable and irreligious Schisme, I dare tell them, that they are making Rods for, and putting Weapons into their Adversaries hands, wherewith to fight against themselves.
And if they would but impartially look back upon the late bad Times, and consider when they had
thrown down the Churches Walls and Fences, what was the natural product of those Principles by which they found so great fault with, and afterwards de∣stroyed the Constitutions and Injunctions of our Church, and how quickly the Wars and furious Bil∣lows of Separation (raised and occasioned by those Principles) flowed in upon them to their total over∣throw and destruction. I am confident, if they be not resolved upon Ruine, it would either bring them back to an honest and just compliance with the Or∣ders of our Church, or else make them more modest in their dissenting from us.
And now Sir, if any man shall be provoked against me for this plain and honest dealing both here and in the subsequent Discourse, I have no more to say, but that I am resolved to be patient under his Censures: He shall be the object of my Pity, the subject of my Prayers, but not mine anger; and to this purpose, I shall onely desire that I may be furnished with some good degrees and proportions of that excellent meek∣ness and ingenuity, of that admirable candor & oblig∣ingness, which I have alwayes found both in your Self, and in the several worthy Branches of your Family, by which you have, and alwayes shall engage to any Ser∣vice him,
