VNto the boundlesse Ocean, most dread Prince,
Of thy surmounting Great magnificence,
Doe we (poore Palatines) from our best hearts,
(Enlarg'd with Loue of thine admired Parts)
Blushing, obiect to thy deepe Iudgements eye,
The fruit (though poore) of rich Loues industrie.
Not that we are Ambitious, or that wee
Can thinke it worthy; of (most worthy) THEE.
But, with our best integritie, to show
The Awfull Duetie which our Loues doe owe,
To thy great Greatnesse; who (beyond compare)
Doth shine so bright in our Loues Hemisphere
That, in thy right, our Hearts, Liues, Limmes and Swords,
Shall stretch our Actions farre beyond our Words.
