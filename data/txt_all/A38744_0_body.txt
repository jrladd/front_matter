My Beloved,
SInce I have heard of your manifold Tribulations and frequent Sufferings, which of late have befallen you, in your Native Country; my heart hath often been filled with heaviness, not only hrough the Report which plenteously have had thereof, but much rather hrough the sensible feeling which I have ad of the same: well, my Friends, this the day which we have looked for, ha∣ving

foreseen its coming in the light the Lord; and therefore did some of th Brethren often put you in mind of it,  (I believe) many of you can testifie: A since this gloomy and dark day came upo the Nation, I know your tryals have bee sharp, your burthens many, your Tribu∣lations great, and your Temptations no a sew: Yet Nevertheless many of our An∣cestors, who have striven for the same Fait and suffer for the same Truth, for whic you suffer at present, have endured a gre∣ter fight of Torments, Exilements, and m terrible Afflictions, then as yet you hav sustained, as may in part appear by this fo∣lowing Treatise: yet in their days the fir had a time to kindle, before it brok o into such a vehement and consuming flame in which many of the Antient believing Christians were tryed, and their faith and patience thereby exercised, and when th Lord had sufficiently proved and trye his jewels, as in a fiery Furnace, then the vi∣gor of the fire ceased, the flame came to be quenched, and then the jewels they were gathered, spared, and treasured up, in th Closset of the Lord's Sanctuary: where nei∣ther

moth, rust, nor thief could in any wise enter.
This seems to be a day of your eternal trouble (my dearly beloved) wherein your Faith and Patience must be yet tryed, as in a Furnace of hot persecution, and surely the flames thereof have lowed, and blazed al∣ready about you, though as yet it doth not appear that the vehemency thereof hath so much as scorched that vesture where∣with the Lord had adorned you; although the fury of man's wrath and indignation hath been greater against you (that would not fall down to worship) then against many Malefactors and Truce-breakers: but O will not the Lord open their eyes, that they may see, that through the fiery indig∣nation of their wrath and jealousie were kindled seventy times hotter than ever it hath been against any others, yet shall it not be able to consume your Faith, nor to burn that garment wherewith your God hath arrayed you; would they but see this, I know they would stand Astonished; yea and fall down in submission to the power of God, in the light of his Son; to wor∣ship him with you, O ye worshippers of the

only true God, who can bow to no Imag that is formed in the likeness of the true faith, true worship, true Religion, but is it not that which it resembleth, neither Conform to, or obey any Decree, which enjoyneth you to act contrary to the Righteous and Royal Law, which God the Father hath put in your hearts, neither can purchase any freedom or liberty by fraud, guile, Treachery, falshood or deceit; surely your liberty shall be glorious, your reward shall be great, and your Fame and Renown shall spread among the Godly and upright, who when they hear of your Constancy and Fidelity will be glad and rejoyce therein, and offer sacrifice of Praise unto the Highest on your behalf with me.
Wherefore my dearly beloved lift up the heads that droop, and the hands that hang down, yea strengthen the mind that is fee ble, and cheer up the heart that is heavy and sad, for your Redeemer is at hand, and his salvation is very nigh, yet not withstanding his pleasure may be farther to try you that for the future you may be more Precious in his sight, and his delight may be more and more in you; who above many of the

Children of this world have obtained great favour in his sight, O loose not, loose not the same, but rather grow and increase therein; to the enriching of your souls, with the Coelestial or heavenly Treasure which will remain when that which is uncertain is vanished and gone.
I have here, Composed a little Treatise which Consisteth chiefly of a Cloud of wit∣nesses who have been ingaged in the same case, for which you now suffer spoyling of your goods, the external Ruin of some of your families & Estates, the deprivation of your liberties, and what not? And now through perusing of the same you may be∣hold (as in a glass) what the Antient Chri∣stians have suffered; first by the Jews, se∣condly by the Gentiles or heathen and fi∣nally by false Christians; yet I do be∣lieve that the notion of these things to some will be but as the shell to the kernel, or as the chaff to the wheat in comparison of that Internal, sweet joy, comfort, and living re∣freshment which (I do not doubt, but that) many of you plentiously injoy, yea even in the heat of these troublesome and Perilous times.

This same Abridgment of Remarkable things which I have found upon Record, I have thought good to Dedicate unto you, in as much as you above many in the nati∣on, are aquainted with the Christian suf∣fering state and condition, who hereto∣fore have been men of sorrows and well ac∣quainted with grief, as by that which follow∣eth will more palpably and evidently ap∣pear. Let not the Innocent and simple be offended at it, because it is extracted out of some Ecclesiastical Histories; For this I say, that many Frivolous Histories which fre∣quently are perused by such as are Prone and inclining to that wisdom and know∣ledge which is from below, are not to be compared to this; for they being oft-times Stuffed with forged fables, and lying tales, they stir up the vain, light, frothy minds in people: but the perusing of this which I have here Collected, will rather stir up zeal, love and tenderness to the truth, and such as now suffer for it, as the Antient Christians heretofore have done.
Moreover through the viewing over of this, a litteral knowledge may in part be obtained, of the Fruits, Doctrines, Prin∣ciples

and Practises, of the Apostatized Christians, after their degeneration, of their Synods and Counsels, and what they Decreed; of the temptations, and provo∣cations, which they had (who retained their integrity) both from the Heathen and from the false Christians, and how sad and lamentable their conditions were that did not continue faithful: which may serve for examples, to such among you (belo∣ved) as are inconstant and of a doubtful mind, let them look upon Origen and hear what he saith in his lamentation after his fall: and let them consider the Faith and patience of such as chuseth rather to die than they would swear, or sacrifice, re∣nounce the faith, or deny their Lord and Master, and therefore were some torn in pieces of wild beasts, some Crucified, some be∣headed, some stoned to death, some stifled, some fryed or Rosted, some burned to ashes, some hanged, some brained, some had their eyes pulled out, and the empty place seared with a hot Iron, some were drowned in the Sea, some fettered and famished to death, in noysome Prisons and dungeons: Oh the torments that they endured are hard to be

uttered, and that about the exercise of their Conscience and the worship of their God.
And truly I must tell you (O beloved) that I was constrained to lay those things be∣fore you, that if peradventure they might in any wise tend to the Confirming and strengthening of the faith of some, to the forewarning of others of shrinking in the time of tryal, and to the strengthening of the hands of the weak and feeble against their Persecutors; who also hereby may see what judgment and misery came upon sundry of their Persecuting fore-fathers: so that in my judgment it may be of use not only to you who are persecuted, but also to your oppressors and persecutors; who now persist in their wickedness and impie∣ty as if they should never come to judgment for the same: well my dearly beloved, be not you discomforted and cast down in your spirits, because the wicked is set up, and the ungodly prospers in his ways, and the wor∣kers of iniquity they are counted happy yet it was not thus in the beginning, neither shall it allways so continue; for the Lord our God in his due time, will strik the hook into the jaw of the Leviathan, so that he shall be Re∣strained,

and the pure and upright in heart shall be delivered out of his paw, and snare, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God: wherefore let none be afraid who are called to follow the lamb in this Notable day, for I am perswaded, that Tri∣bulation, nor Persecution, Exilment nor Banishment, Fire nor Sword, things pre∣sent nor things to come (though all these do come) shall not be able to seperate us from that love which we are made par∣takers of, in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom I bid you farewel; my dearly be∣loved.
