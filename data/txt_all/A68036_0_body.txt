Right Noble and truely Worthy,
VNDER whose protections could I more meritoriously commit this Dedica∣tion then to you, whose Noble hearts are so deeply stampt with the true marke of vn∣tainted honor, that your faire Names in the front of this Booke, will bee to it a strong Buckler, as well as a singular Ornament; For it is not the eminency of your great∣nesse; that induceth me to this De∣dication, but your admired good∣nesse, and sweet affability, most rare, in this Iron age, but still in∣herent

and abiding in your Illustri∣ous blood. Vouchsafe then now, out of your noble disposition, and vsuall, fauour, to learning and good endeauours, to honor with a kind acceptance this poore oblati∣on; consecrated to your VVorth: For such courtesies from you, will make you liue againe and flourish in your graues, Laurell springing from your ashes; while the dis∣dainers of the Muses (which doe abound in this degenerated Age, and like VVormes in Libraries, seeme onely to liue to destroy, root out, and banish Learning) will lie witherd, neglected & forgotten; Therefore as the Poet hath,
Let not our Worthy thinke, it is in vaine,
They by this meanes eternall Names doe gaine,
The Muses doe such Honour to them giue,
That when they dye, their vertues most doe line:

But the enemies of learning, when they die,
As in obliuion shut forgottenlie.
VVere it not for the Muses, our Names and Liues should at one time depart; and when faire Ver∣tues worthy louers dye, then doe their memories suruiue eternally;
Our guilded Monuments doe soone decaye,
But Fame thus sounded shall endure for aye,
Muses embalme our names with sweet perfume,
Times Odor, which no time can e're consume.
Accept then (most Noble and Worthy) of this small scantling of the Muses seruices, by this Dedi∣cation, as courteously, as officiou∣sly it is humbly Dedicated and Consecrated vpon the Altar of your Diuine Vertues.
