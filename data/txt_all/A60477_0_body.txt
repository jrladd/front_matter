My Lord.
THe benign Aspect you were pleased to cast upon the Em∣brio of this Discourse, and the Unworthy Author, in conjun∣ction with the importunity of some Learned and Pious Per∣sons (who weighed more the Seasonableness of such like, than the Likelihood of that poor Essaie's prevailing with an Age so ob∣durate

in its opposing pure and undefiled Religi∣on) had almost brought it to the Birth before its time: When the Edition of that excellent Trea∣tise of Doctor Stillingfleet upon the same Subject, in that juncture, inclin'd me to think of Stifling it in the Womb as altogether useless. But when I ob∣serv'd that the greatest part of the Serpents Brood stopped their Ears to the Doctors Learned Charms, it came in my mind, that the Cure of this Tarantu∣la requires (according to the different Constituti∣ons of the Patients) different Tunes, and that per∣haps a less skilful hand might hit upon Lessons, that might recover some out of that distemper, which re∣sist the Musick of smoother Airs: I therefore re∣turn'd to my old Opinion, that I could not put the hours I spare, from dayly business incumbent upon me, to a better improvement, than by expending them in study how to reason the World out of that High-way to Atheism it is faln into. The Re∣sult of these Studies I humbly submit to the Censure, and commend to the Patronage of your Grace, as that Person whom the Holy Ghost hath made Over-seer over the whole Flock of God within the Pale of that Province, whereof by your Graces Benevo∣lence, as Patron, and Institution, as my then Dio∣cesan, that part was committed to my Cure, whereto I have hitherto diligently, though, God knows, un∣profitably attended. To whom I therefore think my self peculiarly bound (in Conscience as well as Gratitude) to give an account even of my Leisure, as well as Work, in that part of the Vineyard where

it pleased your Grace to assign me my Station and Im∣ployment. Humbly requesting your Graces Par∣don of those Nods you may possibly see me take at a Work of this Length, and interwoven with such variety of Matter, and some Threads that have ei∣ther been snarl'd or not well unravel'd by the best Criticks: (wherein if my Pen hath dropt a word or sentence prejudicial to the Common Faith, Good Manners, or the Peace of the Church, I heartily wish it cancel'd,) [Secundas partes habeat, mo∣destiae; qui primas non potuit habere, sapienti∣ae: qui non valuit omnia non paenitenda dixis∣se, paeniteat quae cognoverit dicenda non fu∣isse.] And your Candid Acceptance of this my good meaning and Labour for the Vindication of the Cre∣dit of Religion, as being a Sacrifice that hath not cost me nothing; your Grace being both privy to that mature Deliberation I have taken in moulding these Meditations, and apprehensive of the Industry is required in making so many Quotations out of Se∣cular Authors: which have long lain out of my rode, and which I was therefore forc'd to run over again, that I might speak to the heart of those in∣genious Fools, with whom nothing is savoury but Humane Learning. In which Particular I am not conscious to my self of trusting to any but mine own eyes, in any material Testimony, except where I make Reference to Second-hand Authors.
And lastly, your Graces Blessing, and Intercessi∣on for the Blessing of Heaven upon these poor endea∣vours. May the saving Strength of Gods right Hand

still support your Grace in a patient continuance in well-doing till he crown your Endeavours (in his own good time) with happy success, as to the Con∣cerns of the Church; your Head with eternal Glo∣ry after the expence of a good old Age in his service; and in the mean while, may the assured expectance, of reaping with Joy what you sow in Tears, be your hourly Companion and Crown of rejoycing. This is, and through Divine Grace, shall be, the dayly, hearty Prayer,
MY LORD, Of Your Graces Most Dutiful Son, And humblest Servant,
