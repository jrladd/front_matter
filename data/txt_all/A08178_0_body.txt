WERE it not (Sir) that your rare curtesie and singular affabilitie is by sufficient proof & day∣lie tryall generallie to the world already kno∣wen, and in many a place, to many a mans comfort both felt and tasted: I should haue bene at this time much a∣bashed thus boldy to prefix your Wor∣shipfull name in the forhead of this poore Pamphlet. Wherein I haue not ambitiously hunted after any blaun∣ched termes or picked phrases, neither (to confesse the trueth) doth this Ar∣gument either allow or require it. But my purpose was with as much perspi∣cuitie as I could, to deliuer the mea∣ning

of myne Author: which (I trust) in some reasonable measure, and accor∣ding to such proportion and pittance of skill as the Lorde hath endued mee withall, I haue faithfully performed. Accept it I beseech you, as the gift of a poore Chesshyre-man (the Countrey where your worship was also bred and borne) and as an earnest penny of that vnfayned loyaltie which I duetifullie beare vnto you. Assuring your self, that although many things, farre better in valewe, and much finer for handeling, might haue bene presented vnto you; yet with a more syncere good will and vowed hart, could not any thing haue beene possibly vnto you offered: As knoweth the Almightie, vnto whose good protection I doe with my hum∣ble prayer commende you.
At Little Jlford in Essex, the viij. of Ianuarie. 1586.
