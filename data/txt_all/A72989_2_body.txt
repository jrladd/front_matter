I May perhaps by some bee accounted a right Son of LeviNumb. 16.7., in taking too much upon mee, to present this Ser∣mon to your Patronage (Right Worshipfull) But it hath some right and title to you, who shew your selves to bee members of the Church, in
extending your charitie to them that are farre off. For you doe not take delight, as Cyrus did,Xenophon. , in putting men in good hopes, but in doing good deeds, & allowing good helpes, to maintaine manie of the Sonnes of the Prophets. Among the rest J was one that had an exhibition from your Company, while I lived in the University. This I could not forget, and therefore, though I cannot doe any thing by way of requitall with David1 Kings 2.7. to Barzillai, & Jonathan2 Sam. 9.7., yet J must ever by way of thankefull acknowledgement, pray for your society, as S. Paul
did for the house of Onesipho∣rus2 Tim. 1.16.. The Lord give mercie unto you all, and grant that you may all finde mercie of the Lord in that day.
