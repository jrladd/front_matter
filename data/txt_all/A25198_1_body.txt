SIRS,
YOƲ are both Adventurers, the one of Estate, the other of Life: I could tell you I am an Adventurer too, if I durst presume to come into your Com∣pany. I have ventured to come abroad in Print, and if I should be laughed at for my good mean∣ing, it would so break the credit of my Ʋnder∣standing, that I should never dare to shew my face upon the Exchange of (conceited) Wits again.
This dish of Discourse was intended for you at first, but it was manners to let my Lord have the first cut, the Pye being his own. I beseech you accept of the matter as 'tis drest, only to stay your stomachs, and I'le promise you the next shall be better done. 'Tis all as I can serve you in at present, and it may be questionable whether I have served you in this or no. Here I present you with A Character of Mary-Land, it may

be you will say 'tis weakly done, if you do I cannot help it, 'tis as well as I could do it, considering the several Obstacles that like blocks were thrown in my way to hinder my proceeding: The major part thereof was written in the intermitting time of my sickness, therefore I hope the afflicting weak∣ness of my Microcosm may plead a just excuse for some imperfections of my pen. I protest what I have writ is from an experimental knowledge of the Country, and not from any imaginary suppo∣sition. If I am blamed for what I have done too much, it is the first, and I will irrevocably pro∣mise it shall be the last. There's a Maxim upon Tryals at Assizes, That if a Thief be taken upon the first fault, if it be not too hainous, they only burn him in the hand and let him go: So I de∣sire you to do by me, if you find any thing that bears a criminal absurdity in it, only burn me for my first fact and let me go. But I am affraid I have kept you too long in the Entry, I shall desire you therefore to come in and sit down.
