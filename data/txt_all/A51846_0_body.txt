My LORD,
IF the Soveraign Disposer of all things had continued the Life of the Author of the following SERMONS, he had express'd his Thankfulness for your Real and No∣ble Favours, by the Dedication of the best Fruits of his Studies to your Lordship: But since it hath pleased God to remove him from the Church on Earth to the Church in Heaven, I am desired by his most near surviving Relation, to comply with his Intention, by Inscribing your highly Honourable Name in the Frontispiece of this Work.
Your Lordships Esteem of the Author, and most free Kind∣ness, plac'd him in an Eminent Station; and how faithfully he discharged his Publick Ministry for those great and most wor∣thy Ends, the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls, as there is a full Testimony given by many sincere and under∣standing Persons of all Ranks, that were the happy Partakers of it, so it is evident to others, by the several Volumes of most useful SERMONS Printed since his Decease. These had

been more Exact, and worthy of your Lordships perusal, if they had been publisht by himself: But such as they are, I doubt not but they will be very Acceptable, for the hea∣venly Matter contained in them.
I shall not Record here the many excellent Vertues that are Conspicuous in your Lordship, and truely adorn your Honour; but I cannot forbear to mention the Foundation of them, Sincere and Solid Piety, so clearly discovered in a most Christian Deportment under your heavy Afflictions. Surely, that Reverence and meek Submission to the high and Holy Providence of God, that humble Trust in his Mercy, which so admirably appeared in your deep Distress, was from the Divine Spirit, whose glorious Attribute is, The Comforter. I shall Earnestly pray, That God, who turneth the shadow of Death into the Morning, will be pleased alwayes to Support you with his Reviving Presence, that he will guide you by his Counsel through this Afflicting World, and bring you to his Glory. I am,
My LORD,
