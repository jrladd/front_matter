IT will doubtlesse seeme strange vnto your Holinesse (most blessed father) how I so boldly durst aduen∣ture to take in hand this disputation concerning the Oath of Allegiance, which your Holinesse hath already by your Breues declared to be cleerely re∣pugnant to the Catholike faith, and with all to dedicate the same vnto your Holinesse. But if your Holinesse will be pleased to consider aduised∣ly the true state of this controuersie, both concer∣ning the Papall authoritie to depose Princes, and also concerning the lawfull taking of this oath of Allegiance, and carefully to obserue the prepo¦sterous manner of proceeding, which my aduer∣saries

haue vsed in impugning my doctrine, and in maintaining their owne, and diligently to ex∣amine the reasons, which did moue me to write, I make no doubt, but that your Holinesse will pre∣sently perceiue, that I am free from all temerari∣ous presumption, and that I am very cleere from all those slanderous imputations, whereof some men haue in publike writings falsely accused me, and that with farre greater reason I could returne their calumnies against me, backe vpon them selues.
2 And first of all it was neuer my meaning, as heretoforeIn the Pre∣face to my A∣pologeticall An∣sweare num. 8. and in the An¦sweare it selfe nu. 111. in the verie same words I haue decla∣red, when I did set forth my Apologie for the right∣full power of Princes against Cardinall Bellarmine, to impugne the common opinion of Diuines, which granteth to the Pope authoritie to depose Princes, as apparantly false, and with inuincible arguments to demonstrate the contrarie opinion to be true; but whereas some very few later Diuines, and especially Cardinall Bellarmine only in a later Edition of his workes, yet bringing no other reason to proue the same, then in his former Editions hee had brought, doe so stifly, and with such vehemencie defend this authori∣tie of the Popes Holinesse to depose Princes, that they imagine to haue most cleerely conuinced the same, and feare not to charge with heresie all those Ca∣tholikes, who in this point doe not run with them; this only was my intent, (to the end I might learne the truth in a matter of so great importance, as is to know what is heresie) to giue at the least a probable answeare to the arguments of Cardinall Bellarmine

(whom rather then any other writer I tooke vpon me to confute, both for that he had out of all the best writers gathered all the chiefest argu∣ments which to proue this authoritie were most forcible, & also for that he being now aliue knew best how to maintaine his owne opinion, and being a question of such great moment, would also by all likelihood defend the same) and con∣sequently I did only intend to shew probably out of his owne principles, and not inuincibly to conuince, that his arguments for confirming this authoritie were not so certain & insoluble that as they did euident∣ly demonstrate, that those Catholikes, who doe not approue the said authoritie, are not to be numbred a∣mong the faithfull, and true beleeuers, or not to be ad∣mitted to the participation of holy Sacraments. There∣fore the present controuersie, which is at this time be∣tweene me, and Cardinall Bellarmine is not concer∣ning this absolute question or proposition, which the Diuines doe commonly defend, to wit, whether the Pope hath authoritie to depose Princes for heresie, but concerning this modall proposition, Whether it be so certaine, and without all controuersie, that the Pope by Christs institution hath the said authoritie to depose Princes, as that those, who defend the contrarie opini∣on to be probable, doe expose themselues to manifest danger of heresie, error, or any other mortall sinne.
3 By which it is euident, that I haue not taken vpon me to demonstrate, but only to answeare pro∣bably; and therefore I can not iustly be blamed, if I haue not brought altogether demonstratiue rea∣sons, or answeares; for it is sufficient for my pur∣pose,

if for the confirming of my opinion I haue either brought at the least wise probable reasons, or else haue giuen only a probable answeare to the reasons of Cardinall Bellarmine, or of any other who hath taken vpon him his defence: for pro∣babilitie of one thing, and certaintie of the con∣trarie can not stand together, neither can there be alleadged any probable answeare to a reason which is truely demonstratiue and inuincible. But he that imagineth to ouerthrow my Apologie for the right of Princes only with plausible, and probable ar∣guments, is both himselfe grosly deceiued, and will al∣so very easily deceiue his Reader; for he that will take vpon him to demonstrate his opinion to be certaine, & to be beleeued as a point of faith, and to conuince the contrarie to be heretical, & which can not proba∣bly be defended by any true Catholike, must of ne∣cessitie produce either vnanswerable authorities, or inuincible reasons, and to which no probable an∣sweare can be giuen. And this is the true state of the question concerning the Popes Holinesse pow∣er to depose Princes. Now what profit this man∣ner of disputing bringeth to Princes, I haue shewed in the end of my ApologieSee also be∣neath cap. 3. sec. 2. nu. 4., and this benefit Subiects doe reape thereby, that, be∣sides the knowledge of the truth in a matter of so great importance, as is to discerne a proba∣ble doctrine from hereticall, they shall most cleere∣ly perceiue, that for the defending of opinions, which are onely probable, they are not bound to cast away there whole temporall estate, to in∣curre the high displeasure of their Prince, and to

expose their whole posterity to danger of perpe∣tuall beggerie.
4. Neither is the state of this controuersie concerning the Oath of Allegiance, which doth greatly depend vpon the former question of de∣posing Princes, vnlike to the state of it. For they that are of opinion that the Oath may lawfullie be taken, are for this cause moued thereunto, for that they are perswaded, that by the Law of God they are bound to obey the command of their lawfull Prince, so long as it doth not apppeare, that he commandeth them any vnlawfull thing, or which exceedeth his authority to command. And therefore these men thinke it to be sufficient for them, if they doe but make a probable answere to all the arguments which are drawne from the authority of holy Scriptures, Councells, Canons of holy Church, your Holinesse Breues, and from Theologicall reasons, or any other proofs, which do seeme cleerely to demonstrate, that the whole Oath, or any part thereof is repugnant to faith or saluation, or doth exceede his Maiesties authori∣tie to commaund. But they that will take vpon them to conuince that this Oath cannot bee taken by any man with a probable, and consequently safe conscience, it is not enough for them to bring only either probable reasons, or probable authorities, but they must also bring such demonstratiue, and inuincible arguments, to which no probable answere can be giuen. But this they will neuer be able to doe, for it is an easie matter to cite some texts of holy Scripture, whatsoeuer thou shalt loose, feede my

sheepe, If you haue Secular iudgements, &c. also some Generall Councells, that of Laterane, that of Lyons; and that of Trent, some Canons of Holy Church, Nos sanctorum, Iuratos, Absolutos, and three Breues of your Holinesse, for the confirming of their opi∣nion; But that this is the true meaning of the Scripture which they pretend, that this is necessa∣rily concluded from the Councells, Canons, and your Holinesse Breues, which they would haue, I doe not say, onely probably to perswade, but by a de∣monstratiue argument to which no probable answer can bee giuen euidently to conuince this truely is a thing of too too great difficulty. And this is the reason, most Holy Father, which maketh me to be so cōfident against such learned Aduersaries. For I am confident in the cause, which I am certainly perswaded to be most iust, and not in my owne learning which I acknowledge to be but very lit∣tle. For it is sufficient for me to bring reasons, or answeres, which at the least are probable, which in a disputable matter is not very hard to do; but my aduersaries, vnlesse they bring demonstratiue argu∣ments, and which euidently doe conuince, and doe cleerelie confute my answeres as altogether im∣probable, they labour all in vaine, and they will at length perceiue, that they do not fight against that doctrine, which I haue taught, but against that, which they themselues haue faigned.
5 Secondly, the manner, which my aduersa∣ries haue obserued in confuting my Doctrine, & confirming their own, is too too exorbitant. For to that which hitherto I haue written, two Do∣ctors

of Diuinity haue made an answere, to wit, Edward Weston, and Adolphus Schulckenius; (if Schulckenius, and not Cardinall Bellarmine him∣selfe, as D. Weston hath constantly auerred to ma∣ny, be the principall Author of that booke;) but both of them so vnsoundly, guilefully, bitterlie, that they doe plainely shew, that they rather de∣sire by imposing vpon mee that which I neuer saide, and by reproachfull speeches to disgrace my person, then by solide reasons, & arguments to confute my doctrine, & to defend their owne. For eyther they charge mee with those things which I neuer wrote, nor imagined; or those things which I haue written, they doe in such manner depraue, that they doe altogether mis∣conceiue the true meaning of them, and so they do not impugne, what I haue affirmed, but what themselues haue inuented, or else they doe so couldly confirme their owne opinion, that al∣though with their clamours they fill the eares of the vnlearned, yet the learned may plainely per∣ceiue, that they are cleane ouercome, and that they prosecute their cause not so much by argu∣ments, as by reproachfull speeches; and lastlie they would willingly that their owne vncertain inferences out of the holy Scriptures and Councells, which we haue heeretofore fully satisfied, should be accounted infallible positiōs of faith; al which partly I haue beneath briefly insinuated, lest that I should be more troublesome to your Holinesse, then a supplicatorie letter doth require, partly I will shew heereafter, God willing, more at large.

Wherefore if your Holinesse relying vpon the lear∣ning, and conscience of these men, or of others of greater place, and dignity, and giuing credit to their false informations, should condemne my writings as hereticall, or erroneous, as Doctor We∣ston, and Doctor Schulckenius, or if D. Weston bee to bee beleeued, Cardinall Bellarmine himselfe, haue falsly and iniuriously laide to my charge, what great wrong your Holinesse should doe me, & what occasion of no small scandall you should giue to the aduersaries of the Catholike Church, I remit to the iudgement both of your Holinesse, & also of the whole Christian world: Neither is it vnknowne to your Holinesse how that certaine bookes, which if neede shall require, I wil heere∣after name, where some few yeares since, by a particular decree of the See Apostolicke, and Ge∣nerall Inquisition through the euill information, and importunity of some certain men, condem∣ned as erroneous, and if I doe not forget, as flat hereticall, who neuerthelesse did afterwards, the matter being better examined, recall the former sentence by a new decree, which did not contain so seuere a censure.
6 Now what manner they haue held in im∣pugning this Oath of Allegiance from the begin∣ning hitherto, I wil with as much breuity, as may be, sincerely declare vnto your Holinesse. It is well knowne, and publicke to the whole Christian world, and which I cannot but with greefe re∣hearse, how that horrible, and infamous conspi∣racie of the Powder-Treason, plotted by certaine

Catholickes vpon a preposterous zeale to ad∣uance the Catholike religion, intending to blow vp with Gunpowder the whole house of Parlia∣ment, together with the Kings and Queenes most excellent Maiesties, their Royal issue, & the three States of the Realme, & innumerable other per∣sons of euery state, and condition, was the prin∣cipall occasion of deuising & enacting this Oath of Allegiance. For in the next Session of Parlia∣ment after this detestable conspiracie was but newly discouered, it was thought conuenient by all the States of this kingdome to frame the a∣foresaid Oath of Allegiance, and to ordaine, that it should bee tendred to all sorts of Catholickes vnder most greeuous punishments to all them who did refuse it, thinking this to bee a most fit meanes for the better discouering heereafter of such like traitors, and preseruing of his Maiestie from such like future conspiracies. The Law be∣ing now enacted there was a great, and long con∣sultation among Priests what Catholikes ought to do in this case. At the last Master George Black∣well beeing then Arch-Presbyter of the English Priests was resolued to be of this opinion (which the greater part of Priests, who came then to London to know what was to be done in this so difficult a matter, did also follow) that this Oath, according to the plaine and common vnderstan∣ding of the words, might with a safe conscience be taken by any Catholike. But this resolution of Master Arch-Priest was nothing pleasing to cer∣taine Iesuites, and some other very few Priests in

comparison of the rest. And from hence all this sturre and controuersie concerning the taking of this Oath did first arise. For those Iesuites did ve∣hemently oppose themselues against Master Arch-Priest, and did constantly affirme that they would reuerse whatsoeuer had bene concluded by him, & that they would procure a Breue from your Holinesse to command all Catholikes not to take the Oath. Which truely with very great ex∣pedition according to their promise they did performe. For, although a certaine Priest not of the meaner sort did presently vpon Master Arch-Priests resolution with all the speede hee might write to Master Nicholas Fitzherbert beeing then at Rome, and did sincerely relate vnto him how al things had past, earnestly requesting him, that either by himselfe or by meanes of some Cardi∣nalls hee would effectually deale with your Holi∣nesse, that you would not bee perswaded to send hither at this time, and things standing as they doe, any Breues to forbid the taking of the Oath, lest that otherwise your authority, as well tem∣porall to depose Princes, as spirituall to define infallibly without a Generall Councell, were more strongly called in question by Catholikes, then euer heeretofore: (For at that time Master Blackwell did onely intend to deny the lawfull executing of your power to depose Princes, things stan∣ding heere as they doe, and not the aforesaid ei∣ther spirituall, or temporall power it selfe) yet this answer he receiued from Master Fitzherbert, that these letters, although they came to his hāds

in a very short time, yet they came too late, for that it was determined at Rome, that your Breues should presently bee sent hither to forbid the Oath. Whereupon Father Parsons fearing least our English Catholikes would be drawne away by the authority of Master Arch-Priest, and of the other Priests, who followed his opinion, sent in∣stantly hither his letters (the true copie where∣of I will beneath c set downe) which were cer∣taine forewarnings of your future Breues, wher∣in he gaue English Catholikes to vnderstand, that there was at Rome a consultation of seuen, or eight of the learnedst Diuines that could be cho∣sen, and all were of opinion, that this Oath vnder this forme of words could not bee taken by any man without denying the Catholike faith, for that the Popes authority in chastizing Princes vp∣on a iust cause is de fide, and moreouer that your Holinesse gaue the like answer to the same Father Parsons in the presence of Master Thomas Fitzher∣bert. But because very many Catholikes with vs (as will appeare by this disputation) do not wel perceiue from whence any good inference can be made, that your authority to chastise Princes in generall is in this Oath denyed, they would gladly concerning this point bee more fully in∣structed by your Holinesse.
7 Not long after this letter of Father Parsons, your Holinesse sent hither your first Breue, wherein you expresly declared, that this Oath, cannot law∣fully be taken by any man, for that it containeth many things which are cleerely repugnant to faith, and salua∣tion.

Some few months after it hapned that Ma∣ster Blackwel the Arch-Priest was apprehended, & being brought before the Magistrate he took the Oath being tendered him; whom Cardinall Bel∣larmine by priuate letters (about which time al∣so your second Breue came hither) did sharply re∣prehend, as though he had abiuted your Holinesse spirituall primacie: But Master Blackwell by other letters (which by chance came into the hands of his Maiesties priuie Counsell, and which were an occasion that hee did more cleerely explane his opinion concerningFor hee was very vnwilling for feare of in∣curring your holinesse dis∣pleasure, to declare sin∣cerely his opi∣nion concer∣ning the Popes power to de∣pose Princes. al the particular clauses of the Oath) did returne an answere to Cardinall Bellarmine. Against your Holinesse his Breues, and Cardinall Bellarmines letters, the Kings Maiestie, cōcealing at the first his name, did write an Apo∣gie in defence of the Oath of Allegiance. To which Apologie Father Parsons in English, and Cardinall Bellarmine, Iacobus Gretzer, Leonard Coquaeus, An∣tonius Capellus, Martinus Becanus & diuers others did answere in Latine: But all of them did so slenderly handle the question of the Oath, which was the principall controuersie, that the English Catholickes, who did before thinke the Oath to be lawfull, were therby more confirmed in their opinion, and the rest, who fauoured the Iesuites, did not a little blush to see a matter of so great importance so weakely handled. For these Di∣uines, otherwise doubtlesse most learned, doe la∣bour to proue, that in this Oath is plainely deny∣ed the Popes Holinesse spiritual primacie, his power to excommunicate, and to bind and loose, which

neuerthelesse the defenders of the Oath, as will appeare beneath, doth thinke to shew sufficient∣ly to be false. Neither is there scarce any (learned) Priest with vs, the Iesuites only excepted, & those not all, who is of opinion, that there is any thing contained in this Oath, which is cleerely repug∣nant to faith, as your Holinesse in your Breues hath declared, and therefore neither dare they pub∣likely defend the same, but least that they should seeme to bee wholly discomfited, some of them fly to certain other arguments of lesser moment, which in their due places I will rehearse. Where∣vpon betwixt a certaine Iesuite, who was then prisoner in the Gatehouse, and some other Priests, who at the same time were prisoners in Newgate, (yet all of them very vehement against the Oath) there was by intercourse of letters a great con∣tention concerning this matter; But at the last these Priests, who affirmed that the oath neither contained in it any heresie, or error, compelled the Iesuite by force of disputation partly to si∣lence, and partly to interpret his opinion in a milder sort.
8 And this is the reason (most holy Father) why very few Lay-Catholikes of any name, or worth with vs doe refuse to take the oath, being tendered them by the Magistrate. For while they aduisedly call to remembrance, that this oath, be∣fore it was by your Holinesse declared to be cleere∣ly repugnant to faith, and saluation, might with a probable, and consequently with a safe consci∣ence be taken by any Catholike, by reason of the

authoritie of so many learned, and vertuous Priests; and with all they doe now not only con∣sider, that your Holinesse prohibition, being a meere declaratiue preceptSee what is a declaratiue precept be∣neath cap. 1. sec 4. nu. 1. & 2. in the end., can haue no greater force to bind, then the reason wherein it is foun∣ded, and whereon it wholy dependeth, as be∣neathCap. 10. sec. 2. nu. 41. and the rest. out of the doctrine of Franciscus SuareZ shall be made manifest, but also they are proba∣bly perswaded, that your Holinesse was by Cardi∣nall Bellarmine, and Father Parsons wrongfully informed of the reason, for which you forbade them to take the oath, to wit, for that it containeth many things, which are cleerely repugnant to faith, and saluation; seeing that neither your authoritie to chastise Princes, to excommunicate them, to in∣flict censures, or any spirituall authoritie which is certainely knowne to be granted by Christ to Saint Peter, and his Successours is in this oath de∣nied, as Cardinall Bellarmine, whom Father Par∣sons, & diuers others Diuines of the Societie of Ie∣sus doe imitate, doth by fallacious inferences la∣bour to deduce; they can not as yet sufficiently perceiue, by what forcible argument they are bound with the perpetuall temporall ouerthrow of themselues, and there whole posterity to obey your Holinesse declaratiue command, which at the most is grounded vpon a probable reason. Nei∣ther doe they imagine that they ought therefore to be accounted rebellious to the See Aposto∣like, for that they, reseruing otherwise all dutifull reuerence to your Holinesse, doe not in a matter which is so preiudiciall vnto them, obey your Ho∣linesse

Apostolicall letters, which either are writ∣ten vpon false information, or grounded onely vpon a probable opinion. For although they be most willing to loose all temporall goods, yea, and life it selfe for the Catholike faith, neuerthe∣lesse for defending of opinions, although they be receiued almost by the Vniuersall Church not as points of faith, but only as probable opinions (for they are not ignorant, that betwixt the Church firmly beleeuing, and onely probably thinking a great difference is to be made) to bee depriued of al their goods, to be accounted Trai∣tours to their Prince, and Countrie, and more∣ouer to suffer their children, nephewes, kinsmen, & their whole posteritie which this our age doth so much labour to aduance, to be brought to per∣petuall beggerie without incurring any danger of denying the Catholike faith, or committing any mortall sinne, they thinke it to be neither wisedome, nor charitie. And therefore they both thinke themselues to be more hardly dealt with all, that hauing so long time endured so great ca∣lamities, there should be now so heauie a burden laid vpon them by him, from whom they rather expected to haue receiued some comfort, as that they should be enforced, to the vtter ruine of their whole posteritie, besides the perpetuall losse of their owne goods and libertie, and also, which is most grieuous to them, with manifest danger to incurre the high displeasure of their Prince, being otherwise very mercifull, to defend opinions which only are probable, & may with∣out

danger of damnation be reiected by Catho∣likes; and also they think themselues to be great∣ly wronged by some few of their countrimen, and those for the most part vnlearned persons, as Tailours, Shoomakers, and especially ignorant women, who although they can scarsely reade the Oath, yet they doe so bitterly inueigh against it, and the defenders thereof, that they are not a∣fraid publikely to auouch, that it is farre worse to take the oath, then to go to the Protestants Chur∣ches, and to communicate with them in Religi∣ous seruice, and Sacraments. And doubtlesse if your Holinesse were but rightly informed, how scandalously, and vnsincerely some of those per∣sons here with vs, who would gladly in outward shew be accounted vehement impugners of the Oath, carrie themselues in hugger mugger, of whom, if it shall be necessarie, I will hereafter in∣forme your Holinesse, truly I cannot tell, whether the tender bowels of your fatherly charitie would rather bee moued to take compassion of those Catholikes, who without dissimulation do defend the Oath for causes which they thinke to be reasonable, or to take displeasure against their Aduersaries.
9 I partly pitying the miserable state of these my Catholike Countrimen, partly moued at their earnest request, and partly allured with a feruent desire to learne certainly the truth in this so important a matter, as is the denying of the Catholike faith, and the dutifull reuerencing of both the spirituall and temporall authority, haue

composed this Disputation of the Oath, faithfully putting downe all the reasons, and and answeres on both sides, and for that cause I haue dedicated it vnto your Holinesse, that after you haue careful∣ly examined all the reasons, for which the Eng∣lish Catholikes do thinke the Oath may lawfully be taken, your Holinesse may prouide both for their spirituall and temporall safetie, as to your father∣ly wisedome, and charitie shall be thought most conuenient. For as it is not fit that hereticall opi∣nions, which ouerthrow the Church of Christ, should be maintained by Christians for Catho∣like doctrine, so neither is it meet, that doubtfull opinions, and which are only probable, and ther∣fore not to be beleeued with supernaturall, and Catholike beleefe, should be preached for vn∣doubted assertions of the Catholike faith, and by some priuate Doctors bee forced by violence vpon Christian people to their exceeding great temporall preiudice, and to the notorious scan∣dall of the Catholike Religion; but as the Ca∣tholike truth, which is necessarie to Saluation, ought by all Christians to bee found out, and maintained, so that doctrine, which is not Ca∣tholike, ought to bee distinguished and seuered from that which is Catholike.
10 And verily if this controuersie had beene of such a nature, that the treating thereof might without danger of doing other men wrong haue been pretermitted, I would not doubtles by exa∣mining it haue endangered my selfe to incurre your Holinesse high displeasure. But considering

that it tendeth to the publike good of our Coun∣trie, to the iust defending of my owne innocen∣cieFor some doe chiefly for that cause among the vnlearned people taxe my Apologie, for that it seemeth to confirme the principall poins, for which your Ho∣linesse hath de∣clared the oath to be vnlavv¦full., and of diuers others, and to the declaring of that obedience, which by the law of Christ wee owe both to the spirituall command of your Ho∣linesse, and also to the temporall precepts of our Kings most excellent Maiestie, I haue great hope, and confidence, that your Holinesse will not take in euill part, that I not with any obstinate minde, but to informe more fully your Holinesse of the whole matter, whereof, as we thinke, you haue not as yet beene rightly informed, and to learne the truth in this so weightie a businesse, I haue sincerely taken vpon me this disputation, whereby we may at length be instructed, what authoritie we are bound to grant both to your Holinesse, and also to his Maiestie according to the principles of the Catholike faith. For both the spirituall and the temporall power we doe reuerence with all dutifull respect; to both of them wee desire to render those things, which are theirs, as well to Caesar, which are Caesars, as which are Gods to God, what belongeth to either authoritie according to the grounds of Catholike faith, we intend to de∣clare sincerely, vprightly, & without any flatterie at all; being most certainly perswaded, that your Holinesse will not take in good part, that any man, vpon ouermuch affection towards the See Apo∣stolike, should attribute to the Popes Holinesse more ample authoritie, as a thing to be certainly belee∣ued as a point of faith, then which by necessary, and euident consequence can be proued out of

holy Scriptures, or some definition of the church to be granted him by Christ our Lord: For these mē, as very wel saith most learned CanusLib. 5. de loc. cap. 5. prope fine., do wea∣ken not strengthen, doe ouerthrow not establish the au∣thoritie of the See Apostolike. For what will he in the end gain by disputing against heretikes, when they per∣ceiue that hee taketh vpon him to defend the Popes au∣thoritie not by iudgement but by affection, neither that he endeauoureth to finde out the truth by force of his disputation, but to apply himselfe to another mans will and pleasure? Peter hath no need of our lying, he hath no need of our flattering.
11 This therefore (most Holy Father) is our most humble supplication to your Holinesse, First, that your Holinesse will be pleased to examine dili∣gently the reasons, for which our English Ca∣tholikes doe thinke the Oath may lawfully be ta∣ken, and whereof they are perswaded your Holi∣nesse is not as yet rightly informed: Secondly, that after you haue throughly examined them, you will vouchsafe in regard of your Pastorall careful∣nesse to instruct them, which parts of the Oath are, (I doe not say only according to a probable opinion of some Doctors, but according to Ca∣tholike doctrine, necessarily to be beleeued by all Christians) repugnant to faith and saluation, and therfore cannot be taken by any Catholike with a safe, and probable conscience: Thirdly, that if your Holinesse shall finde, that you haue not beene rightly informed of those reasons, for which our English Catholikes doe thinke, that the oath may lawfully be taken, and that therefore they haue

not in a matter of so great weight proceeded rashly, and vnaduisedly, you will be pleased to re∣ceiue them and their Priests into your ancient fauour, and that if they, or any of them haue, not through their own fault, but through the in∣discreete zeale of others suffered any losse or de∣triment in their good name, or other waies, it may bee restored againe vnto them in that best manner, as shall seeme conuenient to the charitie, iustice, and wisedome of your Holinesse. And in the mean time they will not neglect to pray con∣tinually to almighty God that he will grant you a long, and happie life to the good of the Catho∣like Church, to the saluation of your owne soule, and to the comfort of them who are wrongfully oppressed.
