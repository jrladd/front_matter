MY LORDS,
YOur Honours were then Princes in sack∣cloth, and it was one argument of your humbled spirits, that your Honours gave so gracious entertainment to so poore a mes∣senger.

I omitted something while I spake before you, that I might invite your Honours to heare. And I have added a little now, that I may invite your Ho∣nours to reade.
The Lord keepe your Ho∣nours humble in the midst of all your successes, that your hearts may not be lifted up upon the great things that God hath done by you, and for you.
Thinke on the poore Church of Christ, and hasten the settling of some government, that the Foxes may be taken that destroy the Vines. Thinke on those that perish for want of knowledge, and thrust out more Labourers into the Vineyard; Yea, thinke on
 those that labour in the vine∣yard, and let them have their double honour.
The God of heaven streng∣then your Honours hearts and hands, that you may continue to contend for truth and peace, and in the seeking of both, honour God, that God may honour you, and encrease your Honours.
