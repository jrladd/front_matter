May it please your Grace;
SInce the great Characters, and Subjects of
serious Plays, are representations of the
past Glories of the World, the arrogance
of an Epistle Dedicatory may pretend to some
Iustice, in offering the Heroick Stories of past
Ages to their Hands, who are the Ornaments of

the present.—Once Persia was the Mistress
of the Earth, the Royal Seat of the Monarchs
of the Universe. Then, as that God, the Sun▪
which they ador'd, lends his kind 'Rays to all les∣ser
lights; so all the Tributary Glories of Inferi∣our
Princes shin'd by reflection from the Persian
Crown. But now that Sovereignty must cease,
and the Eastern Monarch Cambyses can pretend
to no greatness of his own, but comes to borrow Glo∣ries
from the Western World, in seeking a Patro∣nage
from your favourable goodness. The same
Cambyses whom History has represented to be
Blasphemer of the gods, a Prophaner of Religi∣on,
and a Defacer of Temples, is by your power
become a Convert, and humbly payes his Devotion
to that Divinity, to whose protection he commit
himself and Fortune.—But whilst I thus bold∣ly
proceed to Dedicate this trifle to your Grace,
forget to ask pardon for the meaness of the Offer∣ing,
and the confidence of him that offers it;
Crime unpardonable, were not your Mercy as sig∣nal
as your other Virtues: For when kind Heaven
honours the World with some Worthy and Illustri∣ous
Person, in which Rank your Grace mus
claim an eminent place; who, besides your late

Affinity, are Allied to that Royal Race, to which
England owes its three last Monarchs; Heaven,
I say, besides the Great Souls, High Spirits, and
Noble Thoughts it lends such Persons, endues
them too with more Familiar Virtues; as Courtesy,
Generosity, and a Condescension to entertain the
Addresses of Inferiour Mankind, and to smile on
the Endeavours of the meanest of their Subjects,
and Admirers. Else they would be forced, like
Planets, to move in a Sphear alone; and Great∣est
Monarchs, should they admit of none below
them, would make their Palaces but solitary Pri∣sons.
The assurance therefore of these Virtues,
which particularly possess so large a seat in your
Heroick, Breast, animate me to present this Poem
to your Hands, that it may take Sanctuary there,
where in its Infancy it received protection. As
he that's born under some happy Planet, owes the
success of his whole Life to the Predominance of
that kinder Star that ruled at his Nativity. The
Entertainment you gave it in loose sheets, when
it first saw light, encourages me to this presumpti∣on,
now in its riper growth, to devote it wholly to
your Self, and under that Title to stile it happy:
Since thus Guarded, I dare expose it to the World;

and stand in less awe of Censures, when your In∣fluence
protects it, For, as that timerous Pilot, in
a Storm, was Condemn'd for fearing Shipwrac
when his Vessel carried Caesar; this Poem ca
fear no dangers when it carries your Name for i
Defence. But besides the fortunate and glorio
Advantages this Piece may justly challenge from th
Favour of so Indulgent a Patroness, it entitles 
to this happiness, the opportunity this Dedicat
gives me, of writing my self,
Madam,
