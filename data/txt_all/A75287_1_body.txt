Reverend Sir,
I Crave your pardon for keeping your Papers so long: I have at length perused them, and reâˆ£turned them. I wonder at, and could almost envy you, that can finde so much leisure, and imploy it so well, in these hurryings and clatterings of the Times. I am yet, by Ordinance of both Houses, a Licenser of Books to the Press, and have made use of that Authority, by Subscribing my Name at the end of your Papers. I pray God bless you, and them, and all the rest of your labors, to the good of his Church, and the praise of the glory of his Grace: So rests
Winwick, March 29. 1649.
