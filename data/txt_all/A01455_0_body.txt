IN the full affiance I haue in the Lordes mercie, which made this poore Sermon, welcome to so many eares, being preached: that hee will direct it to the com∣mon comfort, being now presented to their eyes printed: the importu∣nitie of many of my good friends had successe with me.
I consecrate it, most Honorable Lady, vnto you, in token of duetie towards you: for your great Loue, by which I am enabled to labour in this sort, and indeede to liue. Gods blessing be vpon it, and vpon you.
