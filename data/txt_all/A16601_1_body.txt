Madam,
IT may seeme a solecisme to match
a Lady and a battaile: for
Trumpets and Fifes are harsh
accents in a Ladies eare; and a
Battaile though but in arras is
terrible: But this makes the constuction good.
I see your virtue (most Honourd Lady) stand
higher then your Sex, and in that I know that
the atcheiuements of actiue spirits are more wel∣come
to a masculine vertue then a soft discourse.

Besides there hath euer beene a sympathie be∣twixt
Ladies and Martialists, and the Doues
of Venus make their nests sometime in a Sol∣diers
helmet: Nay (to passe true stories) the
bookes of Knight errantrie were but shrunken
things, if wee tooke out of them aduentures
done for Ladies. I hope the reconcilementis
made, if not, your Ladiship is mercifull; and
though you detect an errour in my Iudgement,
you shall finde an infallibilitie in his deuotion,
who here laies his hand vpon your Altar for pro∣tection.
