IT was the cō∣mon guise in an∣cient time, & ge∣nerally is imbra∣ced at this instāt (ryght worship∣full) that such as did or do yelde the fruites of their studie to bee patronized vnder the rampiers of any noble Philomos, or Mecoenas, as they vsed and vse (though vsur∣pedly to terme them) neuer stin∣ted to trauaile with tooth & naile to hunt for hauty stately and cur∣rant

termes, wherwith they flo∣rished forth such vertues as their patrons practised, so that vsual∣ly, for hope either of gaine or fa∣uor, a thousand times more laud thā they deserued, was attribu∣ted vnto thē, whose tristing vain and Gnatonicall humour, I har∣tily abhorre, in so much yt (least I might incurre the suspition of cer¦tain in that Getical kind of gab∣bing) I will speake no worde in your laude, and that not vnadui∣sedly: for weying the insufficien∣cie of my wit in performance but of the naked truth (if I shold at∣tempt to pen your panigrick) eke dreading least it should be obiect to me, which was to a certaine writer (not vnsēblable to my self in this matter) purposing to pen the praises of Hercules to desist frō such a foly, wherby rather disho∣nor

thā fame might be purchased to him, considering that there is no such simple sot whiche alredy reputeth hym not inthronised a∣mōgst ye heroicall estates. Way∣ing the case then as it standeth, I count it a mere mockerie here, as the fashion was and is, to tell you of youre rare and vertuous qualities, of which youre very ennimies, if you (as I doubte) haue any, can saye nothyng but good. Thus then, al vain words set apart, I desire your worship benignely to accept this as a to∣ken of the intier affection I bear towards you, which taken as I meane it, shal deserue to furnishe some voyde corner in the lowest parte of your Librarie.
From my chamber in your house at Gaudy Hall.
