Right Honourable, &c.
IN obedience to your commands, I have published this honest-and loyal Discourse: which is all I can say to its advan¦tage: except, what was an unexpected commendation to it, that the Enemies of our Church and State have thought fit to dislike it; and to shew they did so, have had recourse to

their old Arts of lying, and slandering. But it is no matter what they say or do; whilst you continue like your selves, to think the practice of Loyalty not only a part of your Profession, as Souldiers, but of your Religion as Christians.
As to the main Doctrine here delivered, there is not any one true Son of the Church of England, but will consent to it: nor any of its Adversaries, that can oppose it without renouncing the common Principles of Christian Government. As for the manner of handling it, I have reason to ask your par∣don, but not theirs. That I have not managed it as so noble an Argument deserves, I beg your excuse. That I have not treated of it with bitterness, or virulency; I believe, even they will confess, when they shall read it; and let them consider, what modera∣tion, and temper a man had need be of, that in this Nation, and this Age, shall speak against Faction, and Rebellion, with∣out extraordinary Severity.
Right Honourable, &c. 
April 29, 1682.
