Honoured Sir,
WHEN I first resolved to publish these Pa∣pers, I could not be long in suspense to whom to Dedi∣cate them: They contain a short Account of our Own British Island, and I know not better at whose Feet chiefly to prostrate them, than where I found the brave, old, he∣roick, English Spirit most eminent∣ly Predominant.
'Tis the unhappy Genius of some Grandees in this Age to affect no∣thing, but what either appears in a Foreign Dress, or comes fraught with new and unheard-of Rarities from abroad, as if our English Soil was so barren in its Productions, that it could not afford any thing to divert the Curious; or it was altogether not worth the while to Contemplate herein the wonderful Works of Nature, because they are nearer to our own Doors.
And yet, as it is not very easie to discover many other Countries, where Nature hath been more dif∣fusive of her choisest Blessings than in our Own; so likewise to point out any one Place, where she hath beeen more liberal in dispersing va∣rious and delightful Objects, than within the Confines of this flourish∣ing Monarchy, a Scheme of which I take here the boldness to present to your Honour.
Upon which account I could have wish'd that I had Pourtray'd the Features in a more exact con∣formity to the first Lineaments of Nature; but however it may mis∣carry in the Draught, perhaps there may be something which may not prove altogether Indivertive, when your vacant Hours from greater and more important Affairs in the Government, in one of the highest Orbs of which Your experienc'd Wisdom and Integrity have most deservedly placed You, will give You leave to cast some few glances on it.

SIR,
I confess I ought justly to Apo∣logize for prefixing Your Great Name before so mean a Trifle, whose late signal Service to the An∣cient and Worthy Corporation and Port of Dover, will alone perpetuate it to succeeding Generations.
But when again I consider Your great Candour and Goodness, Your generous Temper and obliging De∣portment, with which You are wont to Proselyte all who have the Honour of Your Acquaintance, I am apt to Flatter my self, that You will please to Pardon this bold Ad∣dress, and look upon it only, as in∣deed it is, a sincere Testimony for me, how ready and officious I am to express my Gratitude for the manifold Favours conferr'd upon,
SIR,
