WHere a generall voyce warrants an approbation (worthie Gentlemen and Souldiers) there euery seruice is a Duty. The truth of it concernes & inuites mee to write a pecu∣liar Epistle vnto you, and therein to extoll your worth: And none will discommend me for it, that either imitates your vertues, or would be praysed (as you) for worth. Your worth Implyes your rare parts: your rare part (though many) may bee Epitomized in Foure.
1. Your pronesse of mind to beare Armes. 2. Your actiuenesse in all Milli∣tary motions. 3. Your Subiugated wills to obey your Officers. 4. Your Da∣mon, and Pythian like affection one to another.
The three first are rare, but the fourth and last is the most rare and ex∣cellent; For as a Diamond fairely set in Gold, it giues luster to all the rest, and makes me stile you Philonida or Philonis, a bande of friends, or true friendship, or indeed the Holy band.
Plutarch telleth of an holy band errected by one Gorgidas,Plutarch in the life of Pelopidas. which did con∣sist of three Hundred chosen men, entertayned by the state, & kept within the Castle of Cadmea, called the Townes band, (as you the Kinges band:) This band was neuer broken nor ouerthrowne before the battaile of Chae∣ronea, where they were all slaine, found lincked together with cordes of silke arme in arme, Pikes sticking in their brests.Philip King of Macedon. Father to Alexander the great. King Philip their enemie shedding teares for them, and causing them to bee buried together, who in death would not be parted.

Thus the louing Holy Band,
Fell by the Macedonians hand.
Each one dying for his Frend,
Keeping Friendship to the end.
From whose ashes doth arise,
You that them doth Sympathize.
Neuer to dissolue together,
Nor like God to liue for euer,
For one by one, be sure to die,
Time takes away, time will supply.
And as he brought you to the Wombe,
So backe hee leads you to your Tombe.
