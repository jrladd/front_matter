Right Worshipful,
'TIs matter of just amazement, that sin so wretched in its nature, so pernicious in its issues; should yet obtain so vast, so general an Interest all over the world.
This great dishonour thus apparently done as well to Reason, as Religion, must certain∣ly be attributed to the common depravedness of mankinde, to the naughtiness of our own hearts, which (in this collapsed conditi∣on of ours) are now carnal, and sold un∣der sin. Or (as Solomon expresseth it) fully set in us to do evil.
For the better redress whereof, God ha∣ving erected those solemn ordinances Ma∣gistracy, and Ministry, hath put this matter into both their Commissions; making it an e∣minent part of their work in their several

sphears, to give all due rebukes to vice, all due encouragements to vertue; as the proper direct method both to civil, and sacred wel∣fare.
Such hath been the gracious care of God in our behalf. Every good man must, and will heartily say, Amen; Oh let this righteous pleasure of the Lord prosper in their hands.
In some desires of serving these good ends was this discourse at first compos'd; and since thus published.
Honoured Sir, Omitting any circuitous ambages; I shall only take leave with all due gratefulness to acknowledge the many oblige∣ments you have pleased to lay upon me: and by this paper to offer to your second Meditati∣ons, what you vouchsafed so religiously to re∣sent, when first preached before you, by
Honoured Sir,

Bristol, Aug. 10. 1676.
