Right Honourable,
AS the Queen of Sheba was by the fame of Solomon's wisdome encouraged to take a
 long journey, to have the personall sight and real experience of those ex∣cellencies in him, where∣of she was before (upon credit only) so great an admirer: so I being a stranger to your Person, but invited by the re∣port of your Honours Religious conversation and good affection to∣wards pious and de∣vout persons, and all la∣bours effectually endea∣vouring to bring Chri∣stians unto an exact
 rule of holy living, do now presume to offer this Mite into the pub∣lick Treasury under your Noble Patronage, ho∣ping the stamp of your acceptance and counte∣nance will make it cur∣rant in the world, to whose censure it is ex∣posed, and for whose sake it now comes forth a Posthumus after the decease of the Reverend Author, whose abilities and exemplary life were well known. And I was
 the rather moved here∣unto, upon consideration of my own unworthiness and unprofitableness in the age I live in; and that I am never likely to advantage it so much, as this small Treatise may, although there be more want of the pra∣ctice of Piety, than of the works of those that ear∣nestly perswade to it. And be sides I thought it incumbent upon me as a debt due to the memory of the Author, and satis∣faction
 of importunate friends, not to let this Tract written upon a solemn invitation and request of an Acquain∣tance, to be buried in oblivion; and that there∣by God may be glorified, his Church and ser∣vants furthered in their passage through the de∣sart of this mortall life, towards the celestiall Canaan, and your Ho∣nour (whose affection and choice is with Mary in the Gospel set upon
 the better part and spi∣rituall things) may reap some content and re∣freshment therein, is the earnest prayer and de∣sire of

Octob. 6. 1662.
