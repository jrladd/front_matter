YOu are no stranger to things of this nature, and
therefore the Dedication will not startle
you; such there are (my Lord) whose soules are
confin'd to their Chinck, and these looke squint-ey'd upon
a Dedication, because they feare there is a Spirit in't will
separate them: But my Lord, your Noblenesse to learning,
and wit raiseth your estimate to so high an accompt among
knowing men, thi from thence I have derived this bold∣nesse,
which I hope is pardonable not onely for that your
justice calls upon me for a duty I long since owed your Ho∣nour,
but also in regard the Thing presented is no sleight
Piece, but such (my Lord) at I presume will accord with
your judgement and likeing: It past the Stage with gene∣rall
Applause (my selfe being the last that that Acted Ma∣tilda
in it) and since through the absurdity of times, it
hath laine obscured. My Lord, though it doth not appeare
in it's ancient and full glory, yet it comes drest; first, with
an humble regard to your Honour, and then a confidence of
it's naked worth, but both it and my selfe, are willingly
subjected unto your Honours sentence, which I hope will not
be too heavy, especially upon
My Lord,
