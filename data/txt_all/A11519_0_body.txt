To the Most Renowned Duke of Venice: F. P. V. S. wisheth all happinesse.
PERFORMING with all due reverence the command laid on me by your Highnesse to draw unto a head, and set downe in order all matters which concerne the Office of the Inquisition a∣gainst Heresie: I have found all things so well or∣dered in times past, by the Counsells of this most Renowned Common-wealth, that there needeth no other thing to be done, but onely to put to∣gether that which on divers occasions hath beene determined, brin∣ging to passe that which was deliberated by the most excellent Coun∣cell of Ten, and in the yeare 1550. the 22 of November, the 8 Chap. vid. that throughout all the Venetian Dominion should bee an uni∣forme

proceeding, and conformable to what is observed within this renowned City: As also it was agreed upon betweene Pope Julius the third, and this most illustrious Common-Wealth, in the yeare 1551. Chap. 18. 19.
Which in my respectfull opinion may easily be done, if the orders made upon severall occasions be reduced unto Chapters, and thence as it were a recapitulation framed, wherein shall briefly and sum∣marily be set downe so much as is necessary to be observed, and Co∣pies may be given either of the Heads alone, or joyned with the a∣foresaid determination it shall seeme best.
I will first gather the Heads, then will I adde the considerations and causes for which these Orders were first established to the Ho∣nour of God; for the which it is also necessary to continue the kee∣ping of them, for the maintenance of holy Religion, and publicke quietnesse.
