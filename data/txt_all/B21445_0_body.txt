MADAM.
IF our labours ought to be dedicated to those persons to whom we are most ob∣liged, then I am sure, I am not mistaken in addressing this small translation to your Lady∣ship. And consequently I had been guilty of injustice had I addressed it elswhere. Besides, had I let slip so fair an opportunity of publishing to the world my thankfulness for the many and great favours you have been pleased to confer on me, I had been guilty of ingratitude: which is so odious a vice, that certainly, it is inexcusable in a Christian. For the
 very Heathens by the light of nature have discovered so much of its ugli∣ness, that the ancient Persians were wont to say, If you call a man an un∣gratefull person, you call him every thing that implies baseness, and unworthiness. But Madam, I know well enough, that the highest pitch of gratitude I am capable of, bears no proportion with the greatness of your favours: but I know withall, that where no∣thing else is to be had, your Lady∣ship will accept it instead of good pay∣ment; a mite or a talent being all one to you, whose goodness, regards not the quantity, or quality of a pre∣sent, but the intention of the person that presents it. Wherefore this tri∣fle dares promise it self a gracious re∣ception from your Ladyship, which fa∣vour if you shall be pleased to vouch∣safe it, it needs not care what enter∣tainment it finds from others. I shall use no other argument to invite your Ladyship to the perusal of it, than
 to tell you that the variety of its plea∣sing divertisements, may prove a good bulwark against the assaults of (your old enemy) melancholy: and if it does you that good service, I shal think my pains in translating it very happi∣ly bestowed. I cannot conclude with∣out paying my gratefull acknowledg∣ments to the worthy Gentleman your Husband, and to the hopeful young Gentlemen your Sons, for the many undeserved civilities I have received from them: But they must give me leave to acknowledg my Obligations to your Ladyship in particular, and therefore to stile my self more parti∣cularly
MADAM,
