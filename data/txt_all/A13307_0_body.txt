SYr, your long Experience in the varietie of Cases, hath made me send you these fewe mery, pitti∣full Cases: In which, if your lei∣sure be to reade, your iudgement is sufficient to discerne the cause of their gathering together, and setting down as you see: the best is, they are no such vnreasonable Cases, but they may be pleaded, with pleasure, in the priuate conference of conceit and patience: Some are longer then other, all are free from the thought of malice: But, lest I speake any thing in their praises, knowing nothing woth any thing; I will leaue them to your kindnes to consider of, and my loue to your farther commaundement. And so, fearing, lest through want of meanes to ex∣presse my affection, I should, in the suspition of ob∣liuion,

bury the great heape of your vndeserued fauous, intreating your patient acceptation of this, till a better be made readie: in a pittifull Case of dis∣contentment, that I haue not a better present for your kindnes: wishing your worthines, the com∣fort of all happines, I rest in the midst of al my Cases, and in what Case soeuer: to my vttermost power.
