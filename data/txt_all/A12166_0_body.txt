Right Honourable and truly Noble:
IT was not so much the Nobility of your blood, as that of Grace gi∣ven unto you from the divine hand, which did so much interest you in the love and esteeme of that worthy Ser∣vant of Christ, and Author of this worke; in whom▪ Vrim and Thummim met, whose whole course being a reall, and

vitall sermon, sweetly consonant to the tenour of his teaching, made him amiable living, and honourable dead in the opinion of as many as well knew him: This was the thing (I suppose) which wrought unto him from you (as well as from many o∣thers of your Noble Stock and Ranke) more then an ordinary esteeme: and this is that which maketh me in nothing to doubt, but that his labours made pub∣lique under your names, shall be very welcome unto you: the worke is answering unto the man; and therefore worthy you, and your acceptance: onely this is the disadvantage; that though these Sermons had his owne toung to preach them; yet they

want his owne pen to commend them unto your Honours: I well know that the expressions of holy truthes from a gratious heart by lively voice doe breed deeper impressions in thirsting and reverent hearers, then any publishing of them in dead let∣ters can doe; yet this we finde in experience, that holy and ne∣cessary truths, this way com∣ming abroad into the Churches of God, doe get the advantage to continue longer, and to become a more generall good; they may stirre up the affections, and set on-wards in the course of holi∣nesse where the comforts are sure, and the honours honou∣ring everlasting.
In these ensuing Sermons you

have variety the mother of de∣light; and such notable descrip∣tions of the person, offices, love, and life of Christ, that by them you may not only be setled in di∣vine assurances to your further comforts, but also directed and incouraged (both in your in∣ward and outward conversati∣on) to follow the example of Christ, the most blessed and un∣erring example unto all Chri∣stians. This Champion I be∣seech you both to follow unto your lives end; make it your worke to set up Christ, and his Religion both in your hearts, and in your houses. Acknow∣ledge none but Christ in matter of salvation; and none to Christ in point of affection: let Christ

be Christ with you, and then if Christ (and if not Christ no∣thing can) be worth any thing he will make you worthy in∣deed, he will proove unto you in life and death a Sun, a shield, even a full and an answerable good: with this Christ I leave you, and with you these ensu∣ing Sermons, to be read and ob∣served for your spirituall furthe∣rance in the enjoyment of eter∣nall life by Iesus Christ, desiring the great God of Heaven and Earth to looke upon both you and yours in much grace and mercie; giving unto you all the comfort and crown of Religion here on earth; and hereafter in Heaven. I rest,
