May it please your GRACE,
THe simple strain of the following Discourse, being adorned with no Flowers of Rheto∣rick, no entisements of humane Eloquence, nor swelled with Citations of Humane Writers, Antient, or Modern, speaketh it out sufficiently to all men of Spirit or Candor, that it is not Pride or Vani∣ty, that hath put it to the Presse; but the true reason wherefore it appeareth to the World so publickely, is to prevent and obstruct the Misrepresentations of other, who
having taken it by swift writing when it was delivered, may perchance wrong the Authour, either from mistake or pre∣judice. When it cometh abroad, I know it will meet with such entertainment, as Papers of a more Elaborate and Judi∣cious composure have done before. Who knoweth not, Envy and Malice, to be a restlesse Wretch, like a filthy Flie which seeketh all the body over for a Soar, and when she cannot find one, she maketh one? I should wish to be free of such Wasps; but since it is not probable, that it can be so, in this Conjuncture of Affairs and blessed Revolution, when mens spirits are not to be seen in their Faces, nor their Loyalty to be known by their Rheto∣rick: I have adventured upon those mens Criticisms, to whom I neither stand nor fall. Let none think that I presume in such a plain Discourse, to teach the Learned, who are more knowing nor myself; yet the Ignorant, and such as have fleeted hither till, upon the surface of Businesses, may be brought to some serious consideration, how deeply the Stability and Peace of a Nation, which is truely MONARCHICAL is founded: and if I shall meet with a cloud of Obloquie, Malice, and Prejudice, for speaking the truth in freedom and sobernesse, Who shall shel∣ter me, but your GRACE and the High Court of PAR∣LIAMENT, at whose command I did preach? Therefore let it not offend your GRACE, that I have presumed to affix your Name to such a worthlesse Piece, and offered it to your Judicious View and Censure: I have no excuse, but my reall Respects and Affection to your GRACE (to whom I am so much engaged for your so many undeserved Civilities,) which have imboldened me to lay it down at your feet, and to let the World see it under your GRACES Patrociny. If I know my self well, I account Flattery below me; but I know it is Justice to speak the truth of all men, and especially of those whom God hath made the Shields of the Earth: Yet your GRACES innate Modesty maketh me sparing; and there∣fore I shall onely say this, that the LORD hath made your GRACE a polished shaft in his own hand under the KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY, to raise up
a poor sinking Land from the deep waters of Tyranny, Con∣fusion, Trouble and Anarchy: to vindicate the Honor of this Ancient NATION, over which some Unnaturall men had stretched a black Cloud of Disloyalty and Reproach, to Assart and Restore His MAJESTIES just Power and Preroga∣tive: to sweep down mdny Spiders Webs, which the Iniquity of the late Times had woven, to the great offence of GOD, Scandall of the Protestant Religion, to the sad Affliction and bearing down of His MAJESTIES most Loyal and Faith∣full Subjects. The LORD hath made your GRACE and this Noble Court of PARLIAMENT, eminently Instru∣mental to settle this long tossed NATION, upon a solid Ba∣sis of Religion and Righteousness, to break Yokes, and undo Heavy Burthens, and is shall be your Honor, and the Honor of this Noble and Loyal PARLIAMENT in all Genera∣tions to come, to be called (under GOD, and the KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY) The Re∣parers of SCOTLANDS wofull Breach, and Physici∣ans of our sad Distempers. Go on as you have begun to act vali∣antly and prudently for GOD, for RELIGION, KING, CHURCH and COUNTREY, and the Lord shall be with you. This shall be the daily Prayer of
My Lord,
