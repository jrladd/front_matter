SIR,
AMongst many other Bar∣barismes which like an impetuous Torrent have lately rush'd in upon us, The interception and o∣pening of Letters is none of the least, For it hath quite bereft all ingenious Spirits of that correspondency and sweet communication of fancy, which hath bin alwaies esteemed the best fuel of affection, and the very marrow of friendship. And truly, in my judge∣ment, this custom may be termed not only a Barbarisme, but the baest kind

of Burglary that can be, 'tis a plunde∣ring of the very brain, as is spoken in another place.
We are reduced here to that servile condition, or rather to such a height of slavery, that we have nothing left which may entitle us free Rationall creatures; the thought it self cannot say 'tis free, much less the tongue or pen. Which makes me impart unto You the traverses of these turbulent times, under the following fables. I know you are an exquisite Astronomer. I know the deep inspection you have in all parts of Philosophy, I know you are a good Herald, and I have found in your Li∣brary sundry books of Architecture, and Comments upon Vitruvius. The unfolding of these Apologues will put you to it in all these, and will re∣quire▪ your second, if not your third thoughts, and when you have concoct∣ed

them well, I believe, (else I am much deceived in your Genius) they will af∣ford you som entertainment, and do the errand upon which they are sent, which is, to communicate unto you the most material passages of this long'd-for Parlement, and of these sad confusions which have so unhing'd, distorted, transvers'd, tumbled and di∣slocated all things, that England may be termed now, in comparison of what it was, no other then an Anagram of a Kingdom. One thing I promise you, in the perusal of these Parables, that you shall find no gingles in them, or any thing sordid or scurrilous, the com∣mon dialect and disease of these times. So I leave you to the gard and gui∣dance,

Of God and Vertu who do still advance
Their Favorits, maugre the frownes of Chance.
