MOst Reuerend Father, albeit it be somewhat beside custom to make Dedi∣cations of prin∣ted Sermons, yet it is not beside dutie in me to of∣fer
 to your Grace, the first fruits of my returne to this famous Vniuer∣sitie, wherof the chiefest protection vnder his most Excellent Maiestre, belongeth to your Grace, & wher∣in through your Grace his cōmen∣dation, though to a forward and wel-willing companie, I am now become a Head, where I liued som∣times an inferior member. Which place, as by your Grace his fauour it hath befallen mee, without my expectation or seeking, so I desire to vse it being befallen mee in such sort, as to satisfie your Grace his ex∣pectation and good conceipt of me. In the entrance whereof, if I haue done a seruice so acceptable and so likly to profit many; as the desire of many for the publishing of this Ser∣mon
 would import, it shal (I hope) ominate further good in the pro∣cesse of my abode here, which I wish to be no longer thē shalbe for the glorie of God, the seruice of his Maiesty, & the benefit both in spe∣ciall and in generall of the Church of God. To which I shall bee the more encouraged, if it shall please your Grace to accept in good part, this small worke as a token of my thankefull minde, which in all due∣tie I recommend to your Grace his fauour, and your selfe in all your affaires, to the mercie and blessing of Almightie GOD, who euer∣more so assist & guide you in your Pastoral care and Gouernement of his CHVRCH, as that when the chiefe Pastour shall appeare, you
 may in lieu of present toyle and tra∣uell, receiue an incorruptible Crowne of glorie in that life that is for euer. So resting,
