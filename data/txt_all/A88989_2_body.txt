HAving by Gods assistance (most worthy Lady) finished this difficult, but most profitable worke, upon a Booke of holy Scripture, wherein abun∣dance of Divine treasure lyeth hid, beyond that, which one by the bare reading thereof would conceive; I thought it would not be un∣acceptable to your Ladiship to commend it, as to all Christians in generall, for the light, and instructions contai∣ned herein, so to your selfe in speciall, as a testimony of my best re∣spects unto you, for your undeserved favour towards me, ever since you first knew me. After my writing upon the whole Bible, first upon the New Testament, and then upon the Old, and all the Bookes therein contained, wherein I laboured many yeares (and that, I hope not unprofitably to those, that make use of my La∣bours) the good God that strengthened me, a most infirme man, to that great work, still prolonging this my fraile life; I thought that it would much more availe for the edification of the Reader, to adde upon some of the most usefull Bookes of Scripture to the light given in the Exposition, profitable observations, most genuinely flowing here-from; and therefore finding this little booke, being rightly understood, to be full hereof, but by almost all men passed over, without finding them out, I have also obtained help from a∣bove, to make my worke hereupon yet more compleat, by raising; and prosecuting somewhat largely many good instructions through∣out all this Song, and by turning it into English Meeter, and that so, as by the helpe hereof it may be understood in every passage; and if any shall delight to sing such holy Hymnes, he may now sing them with understanding; For the matter herein contained, al∣though it be a Love-Song, there is nothing in it vaine, or carnall, but Spirituall, and heavenly, all of the greatest moment in the world, viz. the Incarnation of Christ, whereby two Natures were joyned in one Person, the one unseen, and the other seen; the ex∣cellency of Christ in all his parts, and the excellency of the Church, or faithfull Soule in all hers; the sweet savour made by the Apo∣stles going out to preach the Gospel, the spreading of Christs name; the conversion of the Gentiles, then of the Jewes, and after that a∣gaine of more Gentiles; the mutuall love and delight, which Christ and his Church take in each other; and lastly, Christs coming the second time to Judgement, the consummation of this world, and
 the everlasting Life to come, as appeareth in briefe, in the method set forth at the end of this Booke; and now what is my desire, but that the People of God may injoy the benefit hereof, they that hi∣therto have not tasted of the sweetnesse of Divine contemplations, having their mindes now elevated hereunto, and they that have, be∣ing more raised up, and through the joy and comfort found herein, the better able to beware the of sad condition of these troublesome times, for which we have need of all helps, that though the earth shake, and the mountaines be cast into the midst of the Sea, as the Psalmist speaketh, yet we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, may be established in the good way, and so have hope that maketh not ashamed.
Amongst the many miscries of these times it is not the least, that the study of the holy Scriptures, which is now most necessary, is most neglected, to the great discouragement both of Writers and Printers, and the great detriment of the Soule, because as Chryso¦stom saith of worldly men, that pleaded their many worldly busi∣nesses, as a Supersedeas to the reading of the Scriptures; what sayest thou (O Man) hast thou no need to read the Scriptures, be∣cause thou art full of worldly imployments, let Clerkes read them, who have nothing else to doe? Thou hast most need of all others to read them, because thou art, as one upon the Sea, tossed with tem∣pests, and in continuall hazzard of drowning, that hereby thou maist have comfort; so I may say to those that live in these times, will yee lay the holy Scriptures, and Bookes written hereupon aside, because the times are troublesome? the more troubles we are in∣tangled withall, the more need we have to pray, and read, that through Spirituall joy in so doing, our mindes may be eased of our griefe, at the hearing, and seeing, and feeling thereof, and we may the more patiently beare all our oppressions, and miseries, and be kept on in the right way, without declining to the right hand, or to the left, till we come at the end hereof, the salvation of our soules; To which salvation that we may come in his good time, the Lord sanctifie us by his Truth, his Word, through the daily exercising of our selves in the reading, hearing, and meditating thereupon, and by his grace ordering our lives and actions accor∣dingly to the end of our dayes.
Now the God of all grace and mercy make this a meanes to con∣firme, inlighten, strengthen, and stablish you in every good way and worke, to the coming of our Lord Jesus, that your soule may then be found to be one of those, in this Booke so highly commen∣ded, to his glory, and your everlasting blisse.
