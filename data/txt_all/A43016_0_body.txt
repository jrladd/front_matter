WHen your People, Great SIR, had for many Years been Afflicted with Maniacisms, and Fascina∣ted Distempers of their Minds, in a moment You miraculously Cured them upon Your Blessed

Restauration; a good Crisis, whereof not the Influence of the Stars, but of Divine Providence was the Primar Efficient. The Diseases of their Estates were no less Great and Dangerous, some had Lost all, others had Little left, to these likewise your Unparallel Justice was a Sove∣raign Remedy, by Restoring to every one what was his just Right. Moreover that their Lives might be Praeserved from the pernicious Attempts of Em∣pirics, You have Re-establisht a College of Experienced Phy∣sicians, and to these your Royal Laboratory sheweth out of what Materials, and in what Manner

the best Remedies are to be Praepared; So, as You are the Greatest KING, You are the greatest Physician, whence I have praesumed to lay this Treatise at the Feet of Your most Gracious Majesty, humbly craving Your Protection against the Scorvey of this Age, and imploring Your Royal Clemency for a Pardon for this Address, am in all Duty bound to Acknow∣ledg my self,
