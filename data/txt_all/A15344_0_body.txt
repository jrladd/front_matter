THough I doubt not (my good Lords) but that you haue ere this heard of the feareful and lamen∣table fire, that in September last light vpon the towne of VVoo∣burne, in the countie of Bedford, and am fullie perswaded, that according to the measure of heauenly wisedome, that God hath vouchsaued to you both, you haue made spirituall profit, not only thereof, but of sundry other such like iudg∣ments past alreadie, in diuers quarters of our kingdom, and iustly feared, that hereafter may




fall out vpon vs for our sinnes: yet because the particularities of that punishment are not so wel and certainly knowne as were meete, mens minds are so various, and fame increaseth by going, as wee say in the Prouerbe, besides that euen in these things, likewise there is a trueth fit to be vnderstood, & also because the gene∣ralitie of men, either see them not, because they are blind, or els bee amazed at thē for a while, because they haue no further insight, or else make not good vse of them, because they are of carelesse hearts, I haue thought it sit, and that vnder your Lordshippes protections, and with your good acceptation also I trust, to publishe though a short, yet a true narration of that pi∣tifull spectacle, and therewithall, some medita∣tions of mine owne concerning that matter begunne within a daye or two after the afore∣named fire it selfe, and finished in howe short a space I will not write, least I might seeme to vaunt. In regard of the matter, I haue aimed at nothing but this, that the trueth it selfe be∣ing laide open, and some obseruations made thereupon, men might bee lead by the hande to make some profitable vse of it, they being drawne on to repentance for that which is past, and carefully to looke to themselues for that
which is to come, least otherwise the flame of Gods wrath should break forth further against vs, and that to our vtter wasting and destru∣ction. For the manner obserued in this dis∣course, it is not so methodicall I confesse, as it should be: but the reason thereof was the sodain feare and great griefe, that I conceiued vpon the very viewe and sight of the ruines it had made, all making me vnfit indeed for that pre∣sent, especiallie for matter or manner to han∣dle such a subiect, as it ought, both the one and the other then tooke such a deepe impression in me, and that is the reason also and nothing else I assure you, why I seeme as it were so con∣fusedly to deale in the cause, for how can a dis∣tempered mind be sit, especially in methode to propound any matter, sith that to the orderlie deliuerie of thinges, there must of necessitie concurre a quiet hart, and a staied head? How∣beit this I dare notwithstanding protest, that for the bodie of the treatie, there is in it no∣thing vnsound or vncertaine, and therefore in that respect may the more safely be receiued. As for the reasons leading me to present this little labour to your Lordships, though they bee many & the same waightie also, yet take them I beseech you, in a worde as it were. You haue
vouchsaued me sundry honorable fauours, and I would not willingly seeme or be thought, ei∣ther vnmindfull of them, or vnthankefull for them in any dutie that God hath or shalbe plea∣sed to inable me to performe. You execute the iustice of the land, nay which is more, the verie iustice of God himselfe, euen deriued from him∣selfe, by her Maiesties holy hand and power. How fit therefore it is, that his example should bee set before you, whose person you doe in some sort beare, and whose iudgement also you exe∣cute in your functions, that so you might in your places tread also in some good measure in his pathes, your selues can more wisely iudge, than I am able to relate. You both professe the holy gospell of Christ, and may in some sort and sense be reckoned amongst them, that mourne for your owne sinnes, and for the transgres∣sions of the land also. How meet it is, that you and others with you shuld see, that you haue not taken vp this lamentation without cause, as welfor that which is past & present, as for that which is feared to come. But I will represse my selfe in these thinges, and will not cease accor∣ding to all the graces that I haue receiued frō God, to commēd these causes into his most mer∣ciful hands, who only worketh wonderful things
both in heauen and in earth, that so turning vs from our euil waies vnto himselfe, and knit∣ting our harts daily more and more vnto him, wee may haue assured hope of the bettering of our estate in this life according to his owne good pleasure, or at the least of the euerlasting sauing of our soules, notwithstanding all the troubles and turmoiles that may fal out in the world. The Lord alwaies and in all things al∣so direct your Lorships both by his holy spirite, and vntill the daye of Christ make perfecte in you all good works that hee hath begun for the prosperitie of Sion, or the commoditie of the common wealth, to his glorie, and your euerlasting comforte thorowe Christ. London the 1. of Nouember. 1595.
