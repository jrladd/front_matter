SIR,
IF the holy Scriptures had
not told us, that Rebellion
was as the sin of witch∣craft,
we have had cause
enough to believe it;
when in the evil days of
our last twenty years unhappy Wars and
Confusions, we have seen so very much

of the folly and madness of that Soul, as
well as Kingdom Destroying-sin, and per∣ceived
all that traded therein to have met
with Circes, & the fate of Vlysses his Com∣panions,
and to have been almost transfor∣med
into Swine, who muzling in the
earth, and looking for some filth agree∣able
to their bruitish appetite and diet,
can without any remorse or pity of better
things, turn and overturn, spoyle and
trample upon the fairest flowers; and
are at the best no otherwise to be esteem∣ed
then as men bewitched, or hugely mis∣led
by their own Fancies, and arrived to a
degree beyond Fanatiques, and as near
unto madness as the most outragious In∣habitant
of Bedlam: when as in the be∣ginning
of the long and unhappy Parlia∣ment,
in the year 1641. it was their com∣mon
Out-cry, that the Laws of England
were their Birth-right, and they should
be most miserable if they did not enjoy
them; could after that, without any just
cause, take Arms to defend and preserve
them; and employ themselves, their
Wives and Children in a procession or

Pageant, to dig and make Out-works
and Fortifications about the City of
London, to secure their Laws and Li∣berties,
when in effect they did but
keep them out; and after that, engage
themselves, and as many as they could
enforce unto it by an illegal League and
Covenant to maintain them, and yet after
the Kings Murther, by that rebellious con∣trivance,
and the consequence of it, and
a Declaration made and published by
those that called themselves a Parliament,
that those Laws were most suitable to the
good and constitution of the Nation,
could in the Hirecano of their pretended
Reformation of the same Laws, agi∣tated
and driven on by a Mechanick
party that did not understand them, en∣deavour
all they could to subvert and
take away those very Laws, as they
had done the Lives of many, and the E∣states
of most of those of the Kings party;
who really and not hypocritically fought
for them and their King, and adventured
all they had in it; and in that furious,
ignorant, and self-seeking humour of Re∣formation,

could like nothing but what
came out of their own groundless imagi∣tions:
the Discipline and Orders of the
Church were looked upon as Antichri∣stian;
the Laws were pretended to be
chargeable, dilatory and Antichristian;
the equitable sense of Laws and Scri∣pture
of their own framing and picking
out, were more (as they said) to be estee∣med
then the better or learned Interpre∣tations
of them: the inward spirit and
intentions of men were to be the Rule of
all our Justice and Actions: old Customs
and Constitutions were to pass away, and
be laid by, and the new Inventions and
Notions acted (as they foolishly imagi∣ned)
by a more Divine Light, were to
take place, and rule in the stead of them.
In order whereunto, the common people
were taught in all their discourses to make
that which before they had taken so much
care of, to be as a By-word or Reproach;
the Law it self must be called a Cheat; and
the Lawyers,Constitut. Othoboni in Lind∣wood. whom the Heathen could
stile Sacerdotes Justitiae, and our Christian
Fore-fathers Laudabile genus hominum qui

in Campo Justiciae tanquam Athletae militant,
so hated and threatned, (except at such
times as they had need of them) as it was
some danger to wear a Gown; and one
of their mighty Mechanick Comman∣ders
threatned to pull off their Gowns,
and hang them up in Westminster-Hall
amongst the Scotch Colours. The
Judges were many times threatned to
be pulled out of the Courts, and
from their Tribunals; the Innes of Court,
the Nurseries of the Law, designed to
be turned into Brew-houses, Tene∣ments
or Garisons, and places for the
quartering of their Rabbi Red-coat souldiers.
That which was in our Law-books of
French or Latine, must be translated, and
the Writs, Process and Pleadings put in∣to
English; and they that knew not right
reason, the Original and Foundation of
all Laws, nor the way or method of it,
would like no Laws further then their
vulgar and shallow understandings could
come up unto it: and where they might
or could reach it, found it to be no loss
unto themselves to pull down old Laws

and Constitutions, to the end they might
be gainers by the invention of setting up
new. Every thing but themselves were
Grievances: the Moral and Judicial Laws
of Moses, were commended and desired
to be introduced by some, and those of
Holland and Scotland by others, that Par∣liament
not long before as much adored
by a factious and rebellious part of the
people, as the Rebel-Israelites did
their Golden Calf; when nothing but the
Parliament was to be the standard of their
Religion and Conscience: now seemed
unto them not to be well constituted, or
in an equal frame or Balance, but would
be much better if the Venetian Balloting-Box
were cast in amongst them, the Mili∣tary
Officers and Commanders, many of
whom could not well read English, and
worse write it, busying themselves in read∣ing
Livy and Plutarch, and other Heathen
Authors translated into English; and not
well observing the many mutinies, sedi∣tions,
dangerous and trouble some altera∣tions
and changes, which the people of A∣thens
& Rome had sadly experimented and

dearly paid for, and how those levelling
humours by necessity as well as fate fell
afterwards into the better state and con∣dition
of Monarchy, thought nothing so
good and profitable for the good of the
people and of themselves (more especi∣ally)
then to advance and increase the
Changes of Government, which was most
commonly cast into a frame and designe
of their own interests. Every common
Souldier thought himself as wise and as
fit to frame a Commonwealth, as Lycurgus
or Solon; and pretended that their business
was not only to fight, but to be Legislators
and Superintendents of our Parliaments as
well as Laws, they were to bind and limit
them (to their silly as well as knavish)
contrivances. The Lands of the Crown,
Church and Loyal party, were to be a
part of their Land of Canaan: and
they were to make what further pro∣gress
they could in the altering of
Laws and Customes, hitherto, and
through many Ages, so very much ap∣proved:
put down the old Offices and
Employments, and erect new; and the

Citizens and men of Trade finding fault
with all but the multiplyed Deceits and
Knaveries of their own Trades; which
with the adulterating and enhauncing of
all Manufactures and Commodities, have
not onely lost and spoiled our Trade in
forreign parts, but do by the connivence
of their Companies or Mysteries, and
for want of a due execution of Laws, and
Regulations of Falshoods, yearly cozen
and cheat the people at home, as much
as amounts to some Millions of Sterling-money,
or a great deal more then doubles
our Taxes, and not understanding the
right reason, just ends and intentions of
our Laws, nor distinguishing betwixt the
right use and abuse of Laws, of the which
onely the Cozening part of the people are
guilty, neither contented to have gain∣ed
so much as they had done by the Law
and its residence at London, could not
be satisfied unless they could pull it
all in pieces, and make a Merchandize of
it; and believed a Citizen in a Committee
by the study and help of  Diurnals, be∣ing
the Tinder to the greatest of all Re∣bellions,

to be as grand a States-man as the
late Lord Burleigh, or as if he had been
bound Apprentice to Solomon, and served
out his time in the compiling of his Pro∣verbs:
and their multiplying costly Or∣ders,
at 6 s. and 8 d. or ten shillings a piece
for a few lines, to be as great a blessing
and refreshing to the people, as the land
of Promise was to those that had endured
a forty years tedious journey thorow the
wilderness; and when as too many of them∣selves
were, and are by their tricks of
Trade, the grand & superlative grievances
of the Kingdome, could at the same time
raise their false and groundless clamours
and scandals against the King, the Church,
and the Laws; because he would not quit
his Regalities, and suffer a rebellious and
prevailing part of the people to enslave
the residue: and our Religion and Laws
did forbid it. In the midst of which Fren∣zies,
whilst the Trades-men did drive on
the soldiers, many of whom had been their
Run-a-gate or Cast-off Apprentices; and
the soldiers were driven on and encoura∣ged
by some Lecturers, & men of extempore

Non-sense rather then Divinity; and the
Devil leading them with his new lights,
and false expositions of Scripture, and a
gaining ungodly part of the people were
busie in plundering and oppressing the
loyal, honest, small and remaining part
of them, and used our excellent Laws
and Customes as the Bactrians are said to
do by their Parents when they are sick or
aged, and set their Canes Sepulchrales, dogs
kept on purpose to tear and devour them:
it would have been a wonder how any of
the most refined Right Reason or Constitu∣tions
of our Laws, could rest in quiet,
when the Graves of some of our British
and Saxon Kings were in a most unchristi∣an
and barbarous manner opened and di∣sturbed,
and their dust and bones cast
into the Air and High-ways, and the Book
of God it self suffered a kinde of Mar∣tyrdome,
in their suspecting the Origi∣nal,
and covering the sense and meaning
thereof with ridiculous Notions, and ig∣norant
Interpretations.
Or that a very innocent and legal part
of the Kings Revenue so well employed

in the support and administration of Ju∣stice,
should escape a disturbance: and
therefore the Fines which were usually, &
through many past Centuries and Ages,
paid in Chancery upon all Original Writs
in personal Actions, wherein the debt or
damages demanded exceeded forty pounds,
must have its share in the suffering under
those grand and continued persecutions of
Truth, Loyaly and Right Reason, and be for∣bidden
by an Act of a Factious part of the
people, supposing themselves to be the
Commons of England, assembled in Parlia∣ment,
and sacrificed but to the pretended
Liberties of the people, to the intent to
leave them as little as they could of their
Liberties in greater matters: which being
with other of our good Laws & Customs,
worried and cryed down by the causless
out-cries and clamors of those that better
understood their own evil purposes & de∣signes
in it, then the Original institution,
benefit, and right use of them, could not
rise again, or be revived, until that happy
restauration of our King, Religion, Laws
and Liberties: nor then neither without

the Cicatrices and skars of the wounds un∣der
which they formerly languished; and
as the imagination being once hurt is sel∣dome
ever after free from those melan∣cholicque
impressions which it once har∣boured;
so did those of a necessity of re∣forming
our Laws, or of supposed evils or
grievances in them, beget an ill opinion in
the minds of the people, where yet it sticks
so much, as some well-meaning and good
men are not so willing as they should be
to abandon the causless suspitions and
prejudices which they had entertained of
them: and those illusions, and inconside∣rately-received
impressions, have as yet
kept up in too many the humour of en∣deavouring
to overthrow those and many
other of our good Laws & Constitutions;
which if Understanding or Knowledge
may be the Judges or Touch-stone of them,
will appear to deserve a better usage.
The more then ordinary misapprehen∣sion
whereof, by those that build upon no
better a foundation then the ignorance of
its Legal, Original and Right Use, hath
summoned my Duty to our Soveraign and

his Laws to hinder what I may the unjust
Censures and ill-advisedness of some peo∣ple,
who are as ready to cast away their
own good, as those who to avoid a little
cold which their delicacy and a surfeit up∣on
peace and plenty cannot perswade
them to endure, can think it to be no small
part of prudence to tear up and burn the
planks of the Ship wherein they are sail∣ing
at Sea, and far from the Shore, and run
the inevitable hazard of perishing by the
fury of a cooler Element; and that I might
satisfie such as mislike the payment of
Fines in Chancery upon some Original
Writs, and that it hath for many Ages
past been a most Legal and useful part of
the Crown-Revenue, without any the
least of grievance to the people, or our
so often reiterated Magna Charta, or any
other our Laws or Liberties; and shew
them that the usefulness and Legality of
it, is not taken away, or diminished, be∣cause
a part of it is paid, or goeth to the
support of the Lord Chancellour or Lord
Keeper of the great Seal of England for the
time being, in that great, and as eminent

as careful, place of Administration of Ju∣stice,
in granting Writs Remedial, or a∣bating
by moderation and equity the ri∣gour
and justice of the Laws, many times
too unconscionably made use of, or put
in execution by the people, one upon the
other, who are to be enforced and kept
from being over-severe, or taking unjust
advantages one upon another, which hath
taught the most of Nations to look upon
that high and superlative Officer of State
as greatly necessary; and to give him
allowances becoming so great and ho∣nourable
a charge and employment: in∣somuch
as the very thrifty and prudent
Commonwealth of Venice, well under∣standing
the use and dignity of that great
Officer in most of the Kingdomes and
Nations of Europe, and the necessity of his
honourable support, do think it requisite
to allow their gran Cancelliero a great Re∣venue
out of the Publick stock.
And that it cannot be a grievance that
the Master of the Rolls, and Cursistors in
Chancery, are allowed some part of that
small part of the Kings Revenue for their

support and encouragement, which would
be more chargeable to the people, and be
more unequal, and not consist so well with
the Rules of Justice, if it should be raised by
any other way, or contrivancce, to give
them a recompence proportioned to their
cares and labours.
Which my Endeavours, I have presumed
to offer unto your view; not that I can be∣lieve
that your known integrity, sincerity
and care of Justice in that honourable Of∣fice
and Dignity wherein his Majesty hath
worthily placed you, can by any Byass of
Self-interest lead you to a better liking or
approbation of these my Labours in the vin∣dication
of a Legal duty which so many are
ready to throw stones at; and do dislike it not
because it is not a friend to Caesar, but because
it is. But that I can be sure to be well-weighed
in the Balance of Judgement by you
who in the times of our unhappy Wars and
turmoils of the Pen and Sword, when the
Seas roared and swelled, the Winds and
Waves cuft each other, and Mountains and
short breaking Seas did onely busie them∣selves

to run over one another, would not
like the representation of our old Britannia,
sit safely upon the rocks, & contemplate the
fury of the Seas, but would with your Boat
adventure to launch into the Deep, and help
to rescue as wel as you could the Ship of the
Commonwealth, which by the inconstancie
of Winds and Weather, and the rage of ma∣ny
Waters, had lost her Anchors, Rudder,
Masts, and Cables, and was ready to dash up∣on
the next Rock she met with, or founder
or sink into the bottom of an unmerciful
heap of Waters: and when the Law was in
Extremis, and at the last gasp, did like the
undespairing Roman that bought a field,
when Hannibal being at the Gates with a
conquering and prevailing Army, had put
Rome into more then an ordinary fit of an
Ague, publish those excellent Reports of
your learned Father-in-law Justice-Croke, to
tell as well as instruct the Students of our
Laws, that our Laws would notwithstand∣ing
like the triumphant Lawrel and peace∣ful
Palm be green again, and ever flouri∣shing,
and did together with some other
good Patriots and well-wishers to your King

and Country, adventure your Estate, and
not without some hazards and dangers, did
by all the Rocks, Shelves, and Quicksands,
more perilous then those of Goodwin, over
the Scilla of a guilty party on the one hand,
and by the Charibdis of a prevailing interest∣ed
party of the other hand: and of as many
more difficulties as summed up all together,
made a Miracle, help to bring into the Port
or Haven that Weather-beaten and distressed
Ship, fraught with the unvaluable Riches of
the hopes of England, and Restorer of our
Peace and Plenty; who hath' built up and
repaired our Jerusalem, and brought our Re∣ligion,
Laws and Liberties from its captivi∣ty,
and the waters of Babylon: in contem∣plation
whereof, his Majesty well under∣standing
how much it would conduce to the
good and welfare of himself and his people,
did intrust you with the keeping of his Re∣cords,
being the Evidences of the people,
as they were called in an Act of Parliament
in 43 E. 3. together with those which have
been since added thereunto, and do now
remain in the Tower of London, and in the
High Court of Chancery; and with the dis∣pensing

of Equity and Conscience in Causes
accustomed to come before you: in which
great Office and Employments, and care for
the common good, that you may long con∣tinue;
is; as it ought to be, the hearty well-wishes
and desires of all that know you:
Amongst whom you cannot erre, if you
shall please to number.
