MY LORD,
I Should doe my
inclination wrong,
to call this, the first
Testimony of my
Zeale to your
Lordshippe: For I did neuer

thinke the wonder, or the prayse
that I haue written, iust; vntill I
found your Lordships Chara∣cter
in both: and yet the age is
growne vnworthy to receiue
such truths; therefore, some were
purposely conceal'd; and this fit
esteeme of your Lordship, is
chiefly left to delight Posterity.
I could vrge the dignitie of Dram∣matick-Poems,
but that were vain∣ly
to direct, rather then wooe,
an acceptation. Those errors,
your Lordshippes leasure shall
vouchsafe to reade in this Tra∣gedy,
are its originall Crimes,
hauing receiu'd no examination
since the Birth, and being ad∣uised
to correct it, by a suruay,
I sayd; I had study'd your Lord∣ship,

and would not lessen, the
noble office of your Mercy. This
confidence (I hope) shall no∣thing
preiudice
