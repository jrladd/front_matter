RIght Worshipfull, the due consideration of the
in∣numerable Treasons practised and entended a∣gainst the Queenes most
excellent Maiestie since the tyme of her Highnesse most happie and
pro∣sperous raigne, togither with the successe of them and all other
Traytors whatsoeuer, aswell in the Raigne of o∣ther Kings and Princes of
this Land (from whom she is royally decended) as also in her owne, might
sufficiētly haue terrified those late executed Traytors to haue bene
warned from their wicked entents and daungers depending thereon, not onely to
their liues, their soules, their goodes and Lands, but also of the infamie
ensuing there by to their posteritie for euer: in re∣spect of their
horrible practises, against our most gracious and dread soueraigne
(whose Highnesse God long preserue in all health and happinesse)
for whom all her louing and duetifull Subiects are bound (euen in our Soules)
to giue God cōtinuall thankes for preseruing her Maiestie and vs all, from
so appa∣rant daungers as was pretended, and had ensued thereby, to the
ruenating of this whole Realme, had it not most gracious∣ly bene preuented
by the finger of God. The substaunce of which their entended Treasons, I
haue rudely handled in a fewe verses here ensuing, and haue boldly
dedicated them to your Worship, humbly beseeching you to accept them at his
hands, who standeth bound to your Worship (in respect of the vndeserued
courtesie he lately re∣ceiued by your good meanes) to pray for you and yours
during his life.
