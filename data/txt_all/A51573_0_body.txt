MADAM,
THe world hath been dead to me of late; I wish I were as dead to it. It is hard to make or keep a friend in adversity: and innocency is no protection; it rather ex∣poseth unto dangers. But I intend not to write satyres, nor to trouble your Ladyship with any te∣dious or unacceptable discourse. I rather submit my self and cause to him, who is best able to judge: and amongst other my worthy friends, whose favour hath had influ∣ence upon me, I fly unto your self for protection, hum∣bly intreating you to accept of my homage and service, whilst according to my ingagements I do ever remain'
