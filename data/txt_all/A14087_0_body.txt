MAdam,
The desire I had to manifest my seruicea∣ble affection towards your Honour in outwarde Com∣plement, hath on such idle houres, as remained free to mee from your imployments, begot this young and tender Infant; whom I presum'd, vpon his birth (beeing yet an Em∣brio in his fathers braine) to de∣vote, & consecrate wholly to your honourable Selfe, as to the chiefe,
and finall end of his beeing. His ca∣pacitie is not of the weakest: and therefore, howsoeuer hee may now seeme altogether vnfashion'd, I make no doubt, but by conversing with your Ladiship (whose bosome the hand of heauen hath so richlie furnisht with all exemplary ver∣tues, that from among so many, Wisdome selected you, to be the Go∣vernesse, from whom the Princely issue of a royall bed might receiue instruction) his ruder ignorance may be reduced to a better forme. Essaies are the things hee vttereth. His yeeres deny him that length of breath, which should enable him to holde out in a continued, and long discourse. My selfe haue imparted vnto him, part of that beauty and
Perfection, which Art, & Nature hath bestowed on me. Such therfore as he is, I present him to your Ho∣nours view; who, I hope, will af∣foorde him such worthy entertaine∣ment, as may hold some euen corre∣spondencie, with his desires, as well as his deserts. And so in the hum∣blest degree of service, that either loue, or dutifull observance can imagine, I kisse your Honourable handes; desirous of nothing more, then alwaies to be reputed,
Madam,
