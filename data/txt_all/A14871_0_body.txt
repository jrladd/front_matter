MY Worthy Lord, these
presentmentes which
were intēded principally
for your Honor, and for
Illustrating the worth of
that worthy Corporatiō
(whereof you are a Member) come now
humbly to kisse your Lordships handes;
and to present the Inuentor of them to that
seruice, which (my ability exprest in this)
may call me to (vnder your Lordships fa∣uor)

to you, do you honor, and the City ser∣uice
in the quality of a Scholler: assuring
your Lordship, I shall neuer either to your
eare, or table presse vnmannerly, or imper∣tinently.
My indeuours this way haue recei∣ued
grace, and alowance from your worthy
brothers (that were supervisors of the cost
of these Tryumphs) & my hope is, that they
shall stand no lesse respected in your eye,
nor vnder valued in your worthy Iudge∣ment:
which fauours done to one borne
free of your Company, and your seruant;
shall euer be acknowledged by him, stands
interrested
