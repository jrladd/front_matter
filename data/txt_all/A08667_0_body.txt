I Haue liued to be the cause of thy wrong;
I may liue to doe thee right; the first by
casualtie, contrary to my desire, the lat∣ter
voluntarily, according to thy de∣sert.
Accept therefore these few lynes,
whatsoeuer they are, and howsoeuer at∣tirde,
yet as true witnesses of my euer∣lasting
loue. If they seeme vnpollisht (as I feare) hide
them, for thou gauest them their beginning: If possessing
any thing of worth or pleasure, (as yet I hope) ioy in it, and
enioy it, for thou wert the first moouer of my Muses circu∣lar
conceits, which had neuer beginning but by thee, and
neuer shall ende, but in thee: and whatsoeuer they doe, all
shall be for thee. Farewell.
