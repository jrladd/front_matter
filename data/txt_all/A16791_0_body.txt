AS I must of necessitie (right hono∣rable and
vertuous Lady) geue leaue, licence and libertie vnto such as altogeather search
out the straunge operations of thinges wel∣nigh incredible to the rude and
ignorant sort: So reposing a confidence in your noble degree, redy prest to
accept the simple gift of a yong and vnskilful hus∣bandman, I am the more bolde
to present your Ladyship with this litle handful of Flowers, the sent
wherof I trust, being gathered in so fruitful a time, wil so reuiue your
senses, that your godly industrie wil vouchsafe to plant the roote therof in
the Gardē of nobilitie, which I am assured, being watered with the
due vnderstāding of the founten of knowledge, cannot chuse but encrese to a
defens modest de∣meanor. As therfore on
th'other side, your vertuous life is such as rather alloweth the godly worke of
a simple scholler, willing by dayly practise to grow vnto more & exacter
ripenes of vnderstā∣ding. And on the other part is redy to prefer the base
& coūtrey mās pen, to the end that I mght hereafter take the more hart of grace, to attempt a more
substantial peece of worke. And then if it shal please the almighty to be my
guide, in future time I wil not be forgetfull of your Honors clemencie, which
the almighty Gd garde and furnish plentifully
with increase & mayntenance of renowne for euer.
