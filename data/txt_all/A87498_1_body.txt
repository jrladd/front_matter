My Lords and Gentlemen,
THe first of these Sermons being Co∣pied out the last Year for the Press, after serious perusal, the Request for pub∣lication
seemed to flow rather from a good opinion of, then any real worth I found therein: and further, being discouraged by this foolish, and Voluminous Age, wherein every man almost (abounding in his own sense) if the product of his thoughts amount but to the worth of an Egg, is restless till he cackles it to the Press; the abhorrency from which practise did make abortive that In∣tention.
Yet afterwards being wearied with the many Why-nots both of City, and Countrey Acquaintance; I almost repented the re∣tracted purpose; and beginning to reflect upon the Mode of the Times, found my self in an errour, if the Directions of that Wise Man of France to his Scho∣lar be true,Charron. to wit, That 'tis a great point of Wisdom, most precisely to obey the Customs of the place and age where∣in
we live, to prevent misprision and po∣pular disdain, however irrational they may seem to us.
And truly Gentlemen, if you could read that honour I bear You in my heart, You would easily believe your Entreaty to have the force of a Command upon me, though it were to much inconvenience: yet in the cir∣cumstance give me leave ingeniously to tell you, that I chuse much more gladly to em∣brace the motion of the Press, then to en∣dure the shock of another years Interroga∣tories; and the rather, because I have not found, either since the revival of your late Meetings, or in times before their adjourn∣ment by unhappy War, any thing extant from our Country of this nature▪ which presumes the Virtues, and Beauties thereof are not ordinary, in that that comly Dame, and keeper of the virtues, Modesty I mean,
hath hitherto been so strangely prevalent.
For the last, my notice (through failed expectation) being small, and secular diver∣sions then upon me great, gave but one free day to recollect my self: and I trust a good interpretation will be admitted, in that this Gospel-Text (seeing Necessity hath no Law) at that pinch was ready; otherwise a Text calculated for all the Countries un∣der heaven.
Plainly as it was Preached, you have it Printed, without any alteration, save only the particulars in the Analogie of the seed; which was then named, but the prosecution nipped off by the coldness of the season: Wherein you have, as from the Father, the highest contrivance of heaven to be at peace with man: so from the Son, an example of eternal admiration, in the acts and suf∣ferings of his love to effectuate that Design
for you. There seems to remain nothing more, but that you in a double sence Bre∣thren, after the exemplar of this love, may learn to love one another: and to the end that the great acts of this love, both of the Father, and the Son, may be sealed to your souls by his holy Spirit, Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and e∣vil speaking be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another; e∣ven as God for Christ sake hath forgiv∣en you. That ye may be united and carried together in the bonds and arms of that last-born,1 Cor. 13.13. but never dying Grace, to your hea∣venly Country: where her twin-sisters, Faith, and Hope shall cease, but that of Love abide for ever: Which is the hearty Prayer of him that is your most humble and faithful Servant and Countryman in the work of the Gospel,
