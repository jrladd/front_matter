MADAM,
THe late smarting Afflictions which I have felt in my Person and Family, have made me very quick of Sense in resenting Yours; and have ingag'd my Mind on such Meditati∣ons, as may render me
capable of speaking a Word in Season to You.
I dare not be so unjust to your Sorrows, as to dissemble or extenuate your Loss: All who knew the Lady Essex, found it necessary to ad∣mire her for the Beauty of her Person, the Quick∣ness of her Parts, and the most obliging Sweetness of her Conversation; but chiefly for her Reli∣gious Accomplishments, her unaffected Vertues, and her frequent Exer∣cises
of Devotion, both in publick and private. But I need not tell your Ladyship how good she was, who took so much delight in making and seeing her such; and I dare not gratify my self any farther in displaying her excellent Character, lest I should thereby sol∣licit those Tears, which your Religious Wisdom endeavours to suppress. I would rather observe to you those good things wherewith the Divine
Wisdom hath attempe∣red your Affliction, that the Sweetness of the One, may allay the Bit∣terness of the Other.
The Person You be∣wail is indeed gone from You, but to her Hea∣venly Father; She died in the Youth of her Age, but not before She was capable of a Life of Glory; She left the World when it began to temp her with a New Scene of Enjoyments; but She left its Vanities,
and Troubles too, and hath gain'd by the ex∣change much purer and more lasting Joys.
You have lost One Blessing, but Others continue still, which de∣serve your Esteem and Love, and which may support and consolate the Remainder of your Life, You have lost a Child, but Your Hea∣venly Father is immor∣tal and unchangeable, who will continue to dwell with you here by
his Holy Spirit, till he take you up to dwell with him Above; of which he hath given you a Pledg in advancing a part of you already thither.
Let not then the evil Things You have met with, so far ingross Your Thoughts and Af∣fections as to rob God of the Honour, and Your self of the Comfort, of all those good Things he hath provided and prepared for You.

And to assist You here∣in, I humbly offer the ensuing Discourse, to perfect You in that Art, wherein You are already so well improv'd, of re∣ceiving dutifully what∣ever good or evil is dis∣pensed to You by the Hand of Providence.
That You may continue long among us to recom∣mend the Power and Beauty of Religion by Your Illustrious Example: And may at last exchange Your Earthly
Honour for a far bright∣er Glory in Heaven, is the Hearty Prayer of,
MADAM,
