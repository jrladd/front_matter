Worthy Sir,
JUstice should ever be first served, before Charity, and e paying of Debts, be before he giving of Alms. And how∣ver the Subject of this Dis∣urse be meer Alms, yet the pre∣enting of it to your Hand, is ut a piece of Justice owing from  to your self; not only from he more common score, as you re a part of that Body, unto whose audience it was first deliver∣d, but upon the private account of our especial Favours to my par∣icular, which I shall always knowledge, with all due and deserved thankfulness. For in

truth, when your Kindness first found me, it was very singu∣lar, being such as wholly pre∣vented my very acquaintance with you. So that I first felt you favour as a Patron, before  had the Knowledge of your Fac or Person. This so unusu and surprizing a Method of Benificence, hath moved me to take this first occasion in my appearing in publick, to declare your Nobleness, and to testifi unto the World my deep Obli∣gations. Accept, I beseech you this small Testimony, of a great and grateful respect, from him who desires ever to show himself

From Reifham Nov. 15. 1679.
