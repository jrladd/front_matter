My Lord,
COntemplation and Action have their different Seasons. It was after the defeat of Antony, and

the business of the World pretty well oer, when Virgil and Horace came to be so distinguish'd at Court.
Alexander, who had given so good proof of his Judgment by the Ho∣nours paid to the Memory of Ho∣mer, and of Pdar, found in his time no better Poet than .  to the great Alexander, was for Laureate and Historiographer.
When once again the business of the World is over, Now my Lord, that the Muses Commonweal is be∣come your Province, what may we not expect? This I say, not with intent to apply that of Quintilian on Augustus Caear, Parum Diis visum est esse eum Maximm Poetarum: that were a Common Topick: But because, when some years ago, I tryed the Publick with Observations concern∣ing the Stage; It was principally your Countenance that buoy'd me

up, and supported a Righteous Cause against the Prejudice and Corruption then reigning.
I would not raise up again the Spirit of the late Prince of Conti; His Traite contre la Comedie, has by o∣thers been termed la defense de la ver∣tu. My zeal goes no higher than the Doctrine of Horace, and Ari∣stotle; and the Primitive Fathers of Dramatick Poety: If that Purity may be Allow'd under a Christian Dis∣pensation.
The World, surely, other Mat∣ters apart, owes much to Cardinal Richelieu, for his Encouragement to the Belles Lettres. From thence we may reckon, that we begin to un∣derstand the Epick Poem by the means of Bossu; and Tragedy by Monsieur Dcier. The World is not agreed which is the Nobler Poem: Plao and Bossu prefer the

former; Aristotle and Dacier declare for Tragedy. Three, indeed, o the Epick (the two by Homer and Virgil's Aeneids) are reckon'd in the degree of Perfection: But amongst the Tragedies, only the Oedipus of Sophocles. That, by Corneille, and by others, of a Modern Cut, quan∣tum Mutaus! but I already trespass too long upon your time, who am,
My Lord,
