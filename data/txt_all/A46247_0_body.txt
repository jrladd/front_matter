Most honoured Sir,
WHen you shall make a review of your own Merits, and peruse with pausing Curiosity these Poetical imperfecti∣ons, my fears are that you will con∣demn my confidence, but my hopes are as great that you wil commend my prudence from whence I extract this presumption, that though all Crit∣ticks should comply to cry down my wit in Com∣posing my Poems, they shall applaud my judg∣ment in the choiee of my Patron.
Sir, Your own deservings declare you to be no less then a Palace of Honour, if these Poems, like a Vine or Woodbine may support themselves upon Your Edifice, they may by this fortunate transplantation grow more fragrant, and grati∣fie

Your Indulgence. Sir, in one Word, Your Candor hath compeld me to make these Poetical Adresses, if any thing in them may either pro∣voke Your praise or pardon, I shall congratulate that happy means which (through this martial mist of violence and ignorance) hath safely con∣ducted me to so splendid a Sphere of Love and Ingenuity, and be alwaies studious to deserve (what I have been ever ambitious to desire) a seat in Your memory, and liberty to subscribe
Sir,
