Worthy Mistrisse,
THE acknowledge∣ment
of your
favours shal
bee my meanest thankes

and to thanke you for
those favours, must bee
my best acknowledge∣ment.
I can doe no
more, I will doe no
lesse, Nor have I any
better meanes to shew
my owne living grate∣fullnesse,
then by cou∣pling
it with my dead
Sons thankfullnesse, and
by receiving his, to en∣liven
my owne, and to
testifie both to posterity,

to your selfe, to
whose name and worth,
he meditated and inten∣ded,
to rayse a fairer
Monument, had hee li∣ved.
This prevented,

what remaineth, but
that this remnant
cloathe his thankfullnesse
as farre as it can, and
supply the necessitated
defect of his uneffected
purpose. These collected
out of loose papers, seeme
to bee wrought in some
sudaine temperate heate
of his honest fantasie,
and hammered on the
anvill of objected occase∣ons,
and being forged
roughly into these
shapes, were cast a coo∣ling

into the next paper
that came to hand: and
so wanting filing, and
polishing, must crave
pardon for their ruder
forme. They assume
their greatest worth and
value from your courte∣ous
acceptance, and ac∣compt
it their chiefest
happinesse, if, for them,
you love his memory
while you live, who en∣deavoured
to make
your memory out-live
your selfe. This if you

deigne to doe you shall
much comfort the sad∣nesse of
