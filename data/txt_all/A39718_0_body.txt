Madam,
I Present you here with my Love's Do¦minion,
to which you are no Stranger
having the Art, by your many Excellent
Qualities, to make your self honour'd, and
beloved of all: Neither is it a Stranger unto
you, you having been pleased to like it, when I
made you but a confused relation of it, and will
much more now (I hope) representing it more
clearly to your view. I must intreat you to fa∣vour
it a little, for never a more Innocenter thing
appeared in Court; and I do not know how much
it would be out of Countenance, were it not en∣couraged
and Countenanced by you; For the rest,
I dare not Interest you in its more publique Re∣presentation,
not knowing how the palat of the
Time may relish such Things yet, which, till it

was disgusted with them, was formerly numbred
amongst its chiefest Dainties, and is so much
onged for still, by all the nobler and better sort,
as could it but be effected by your mediation, you,
should infinitely oblige them all; and in parti∣ar,
Madam,
