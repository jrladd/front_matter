NOble and mighty Lords, I present un∣to your Lordships a little Book; or ra∣ther it presents it selfe, which though the quantity thereof

bee very small, yet being of a great quality, and altoge∣ther appropiate unto your Lordships; for it maintaineth your command, your Right and Soveraignty. The scope and drift thereof is to demon∣strate and prove, (as it were cursively, and running over the times past, even from the beginning of this so famous Nation, unto this very present day) how that the chief So∣veraignty of the publike af∣fairs, hath ever had place in the principall of the two States, which were then the Battavers; but now are the Hollanders and the West Freises. The which So∣raignty through a long conti∣nuall

consequent Succession, is now at this present esta∣blished in your Lordships.
This Soveraignty and pow∣er of the States hath been the foundation of the Common∣wealth, the harbour of per∣fect moderated equity, and the bridle of the Principalities prodigality.
This power in former times hath been a terror, and for feare thereof, even the chiefest Commanders, and those Re∣gents of the State of the Land, have willingly submitted their magnifience thereunto; yea, whether they were Kings, or Generals, or those which in these latest times were

called the Earles thereof.
The very Lawes and Privi∣ledges thereof, which are ho∣ly and unviolable, have like∣wise also continually been pre∣served safely in the custody and possession, and as it were in the bosome of the States.
By the resolutions of their Lordships, is that Liberty, (which in former times the Hollanders have had, and is now againe so farre famous) sailed through those mighty raging tempests, even unto these happy dayes and times.
For what greater dangers could have hapned to any for their Liberty, then that which hath hapned unto them? as

first, that the Romish power, and afterwards that of the Spanish power, which is the next unto the Romish, or else according unto their own opinion farre greater then the Romish, power it self was.
Yet neverthelesse, that Li∣berty hath wrestled and strug∣led it self through both of those hideous dangers; and when they were enforced to take Arms, They first opposed a∣gainst the violence of their Oppressors, the reasonable∣nesse of their Cause, a good politick Order, and an invinci∣ble courage.
The happy event thereof hath declared it self at two se∣verall

times unto the admira∣tion of all Nations, upon the face of the Earth, and with the Warre is the fame and power thereof encreased, even as it pleaseth the wisedome of God, commonly first to prove and assay those with great travels and dangers, whom hee will afterwards ad∣vance to great honours.
Under the condition of those same Lords and Go∣vernours, hath ever appeared that great fidelity of the Bat∣tavers, which was never lesse then the valiantnesse of their deeds in Warre; which fide∣lity the Romans can suffici∣ently testifie of, in the times

of your Lordships Predeces∣sors: And the Neighbouring Kings doe now acknowledge the same in your Lordships: And not only they, but also even those which are our Antipodes, and which behold another Firmament and Stars.
The recitation of all which things according unto their deserts, would be matter for the furnishing of a great Hi∣story.
It may suffice for this pre∣sent, shortly and summarily to relate the Antiquity of this Government which hapned under the Government of the Nobles or States, the labour whereof I doubt not but it

will be profitable for the In∣habitants, and very acceptable unto Strangers; for although it be very true, that which in old time was reported of Al∣cibiades and also Augustus, which is, That a good Subject is bound to defend the present estate of the Common-wealth, and to seek for no Alteration▪ Yet neverthelesse, we desire and more earnestly affect such a kinde of Government, as we our selves enjoy, and besides we perceive hath been pleasing to our fore-fathers, whether it be as the best in it self, or whe∣ther it be that which is most convenient for them, the which our Fathers have main∣tained

and defended even with their dearest lives, ha∣ving left the same as their own proper inheritance unto their succeeding posterity.
Hereunto may also be ad∣ded, that in all matters Anti∣quity is much respected, and of great worth; yea, so much esteemed, that they of Marse∣illes, whose Common-wealth is anciently reported to be so exceeding famous, and for which they are so highly com∣mended, that they even from the first foundation of that Ci∣ty, have themselves used the sword for the execution of Justice upon Malefactors; shewing thereby, that also

even in the smallest matters, all the least points of Ancient Custome ought to be main∣tained: for Antiquity in some respects commeth nearest un∣to God, by way of resem∣blance that it hath with Eter∣nity.
From whence also it pro∣ceedeth, that in our hearts, there is bred a reverentnesse and respect unto Antiquity; which Antiquity in the Com∣mon-Wealth ought much more to bee had in estimati∣on, rather then in the persons of men, in regard that in the persons of men, which are mortall, their Antiquity or An∣tientnesse is a sign of their

approaching Death: But An∣tiquity in the Common∣wealth being once settled and grounded upon hope of never to die, doth beget from time her vertue and force, and be∣commeth the more old the more able; for continuance is an infallible demonstration of a well framed policy: from hence proceedeth an assu∣rance and affection unto the Government, even from the very hearts of the Inhabitants. And this is the very principall occasion of the continuance and standing of a Common∣wealth, because that in former times it so continued.
It was also reason that I had

some respect unto Strangers, to the end that those which are exceeding desirous to be informed of the state of this Common-wealth, by reason of the greatnesse of those fa∣mous Acts atchieved by the same, might not only know the estate thereof as it is at this present, but also in what estate the same hath been in times past.
Also taking away an abuse which oftentimes proceedeth from names that are alike, in matters that are differing; for the Princes themselves were not alwayes alike, nor yet the States neither; for sometimes the Chief Power and Sove∣raignty

was in the person of one man; but then the coun∣sell and advice for the effect∣ing of businesses was in the persons of many. At other times the Soveraigntie was in many, but the Administration in the person of one man. At some times the Lawes were subject to the Prince; at other times the Prince subject to the Lawes: All which, if a man will deliberately ponder, hee shall easily find, that that Com∣monwealth which is at this present among us, hath not had its begining now of late, but that the very same Com∣monwealth that in former times hath been, is now made

more manifest, and appeareth more cleare and evidenter then ever before. For like as a house may continue stand∣ing though some parts there∣of be altered and changed: but if the foundation bee over∣throwne, it cannot continue standing; Even so, the alter∣ing and changing of names and Offices of some Magi∣strates, doth not make pre∣sently another Common∣wealth, in regard that the principall Power and Sove∣raignty, and as it were the very soule of that whole body which hath its being, moveth and keepeth together, and doth remain and continue one

and the very self-same.
It remaineth then, (Noble and most worthy Lords) that we pray unto the Lord God, who is the establisher and maintainer of this State, That it will please him to defend and maintaine that Liberty, the which is not so much de∣fended by your especiall pro∣vidence, and the worthy va∣lor of the Burgesses and Soul∣diers, as it hath been hitherto, and is yet defended by his heavenly assistance, and may yet extend it selfe for many yeeres to come; and GOD grant, that it may continue among us, and be made our owne, even all these blessings

that we now at this present do enjoy; but before all things grant us as an assured pledge of the common Tranquillity, Piety, Equity, and Vnity; thus prayeth he who is
