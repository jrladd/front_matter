SIR,
THis work made for the defence and by the express command of your blessed and glorious Grandfather King JAMES, and after his de∣cease presented by the Author to your incomparable Father, our great King and holy Martyr, is now humbly presented to your Royal Highness by the Translator, son and heir of the Authors Zeal to the vindication of Gods Truth, and the Rights of your sacred Family. The enemies we had to wrastle with in the late desolation of our beheaded Church and State, are the same that are impugned in this Book. For although the Kings enemies and yours were at open defiance with the Court of Rome, yet they were acted by that Court, and played the Popes game. Their common interest, which was most earnestly followed, was to force our King
 and our Princes into the Romish superstition. And as the one side had made of Davids com∣plaint a Motto for them, They have driven us this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, say∣ing, Go serve other Gods: So the other party left no way untryed to work upon the distresses of your sacred persons, and inrich their party with so great a prize. But God indowed your pious and magnanimous hearts with so much heroick strength, that the great Tempter offered in vain unto you, as unto Christ, the greatness and glory of the world to make you fall down to him and worship him: And your valour in the field, which hath got an immortal fame to your name, was yet inferiour to your valour in the tempta∣tion. By thus fighting the good fight and keep∣ing the faith, you are become Conquerers of three Kingdoms, besides that of Heaven, and have engaged God in the defence of your Cause by sticking to his; with so much glorious success that all ages shall adore the excellency of his love in the miracles of your restitution. Go on, Generous Prince, in the strength of God, and in conjunction with our gracious King, to be the Protector of true Religion, the maintainer of Justice, the comfort of good men, the terrour of the evil, and the pattern of all vertues, the true way to be the example of all blessings. That all the blessings which heaven can shower down, and make the earth bring forth, may ever flow upon your Princely head, is the daily prayer of
