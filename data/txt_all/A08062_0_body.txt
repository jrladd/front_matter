SIR,
I Am not carefull
to annexe your
other Titles: for
they are not so
much honour to you, as they

are honoured by you; and
your bare Name sounds
more honorably in my judg∣ment,
then that which the
breath of others can adde
unto it.
I have made bold there∣fore
(though without your
knowledge) to send abroad
with your Name prefixed,
this ancient Greek Father,
newly taught to speak En∣glish;
that hee may receive
your approbation where
hee well expresseth his
meaning, and your cor∣rection
hereafter where
hee proves defective; For,
I presumed you might by
this meanes be provoked
to the perusall thereof, not∣withstanding
your many
studies.

Your Candor, and sin∣gular
humanity, make mee
confident in this attempt;
For though my Author be
a stranger to most moderne
Students, you (from whom
no such Worthie is obscu∣red)
are his familiar ac∣quaintance;
and in whose
Name could I have more
properly brought this Aun∣cient
among my Country∣men
(to be entertained
with respect) then in yours,
who are the truest lover
of Antiquities; and hee,
who hath best shewed the
right use of them to this
Age?
I think not you to be any
whit honoured by this De∣dication;
but, hat I have
rather magnified my selfe

in making it an occasion to
signifie that I have so noble
a Friend. Yet without all
such respects, I have done
this, meerely to content my
self, in that which I thought
could not justly discontent
you; and, to say truth, having
a long time loved your per∣son,
and honoured your
worth, it is now an
ease, and a delight to mee,
to expresse it by this occa∣sion.
And, you have not been
pretious to mee without
cause: For, I being one of
those, who preposterously, be∣gin
to write before they
learne, you might justly
enough have reputed mee
worthy of contempt onely,
when I was first presented to

your acquaintance. Never∣thelesse,
(perceiving, it may
be that the affections of my
heart were sound, though
the fruits of my braine were
defective) you vouchsafed
mee a friendly, and a fre∣quent
familiarity: where∣by
I got opportunities both
to rectifiemy Judgement,
and encrease my Vn∣derstanding
in many
things.
Were the same humble af∣fability
in those, (whom a
lesse degree of knowledge
hath vainly puffed up, to the
corrupting of them into
that, which is worse then
Ignorance) they might
have beene more beloved;
and perhaps, more wise men

then they are. To amend
them & to encourage others
to the like Vertue, I have
testified this of you, and
in that, shall perchance,
adde somewhat to your ho∣nour.
I have lately confined my
selfe to my rustick habita∣tion,
in that part of this
Kingdome, which is famous
for the best of those meats,
wherewith the Poet Martial
invited his friend: Pallens
Faba, cum rubenti Lardo:
yet it hath not made mee so
meer a Corydon, but that I
relish the delicates of the
MVSES; and retaine
some ambition to be continu∣ed
in your esteem. And, SIR,
wheresoever I am, you shall

ever be remembred, and be∣loved
of

From my Cottage, under
the Beacon hill neere
Farnham. May 23.
1636.
