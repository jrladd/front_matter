 but stand ready for such another? I had dedicated these my first-fruits in the Church, to him to whom all first-fruits are due; but that I considered, that Kings, like High Altars, ought not to be approached all at once, but by steps and degrees; as also that such a Tragedy as I here relate, could not be pleasant to his Majesty to read, though very profitable for his Subjects that it should be written. The Loyal Con∣tents of this small Treatise may assure the world, that your Lordship hath admitted into his Majesties Service, a Person of as unfained and fervent Loyalty as your heart could wish, or as the world affords. And now my Lord, what remains but my most ar∣dent wishes (in which I know your Lordship will joyn with me) viz. That the Soul of our Lord the King may be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord his God (as the Phrase is, 1 Sam. 25.29.) and the lives of his enemies may be slung out as out
of the middle of a sling; that his Ene∣mies may be clothed with shame, but upon himself his Crown may flourish; and that God would cover his head both in the day of Battle, and of Peace. For your Lordship, I have no greater thing to wish, than that the King of Kings may take your Lordship as much into his favour, as the King of England has done; and instead of the Star which his Majesty hath bestowed upon you, may in due time give you that Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judg shall give at the great day to all them that love his appearing, which is the hear∣ty Prayer, of
My Lord,
