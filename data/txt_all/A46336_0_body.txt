MY LORD,
THis Sermon Preached Sixteen years agoe and upward, upon your Lordships Account (though then you was not able to take notice of it) having layne by me ever since, does now, by your Lordships particular desire, (which I shall ever interpret as a Command) present it self to your Lordships hands. It was my desire (being sufficiently conscious to my self of se∣veral Reasons for it) that it might have enjoyed the same security, by enjoying the same obscurity still. But since your Lordship will have it otherwise, I prefer my obedience to all other considerations, and wholly surren∣der
my self and it to your Lordships Disposal, hoping that if you shall think it fit (as I do not) to suffer it to see any further light, then that of your Lordships Closet; it may appear under the Patronage of your Honours name, as a small Testimony of the great obligation I have to your Honour, and Noble Family: For whose health and happiness daily pray∣eth (as in duty he is Bound)
My Lord,
