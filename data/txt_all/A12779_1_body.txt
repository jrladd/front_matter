I Haue the rather presumed hum∣bly to offer vnto your Honour the dedication of this little Poëme, for that the noble and vertuous Gentlewomā of whom it is written, was by match neere alied, and in affection greatly deuoted vnto your Ladiship. The occasion why I wrote the same, was aswell the great good fame which I heard of her deceassed, as the par∣ticular good will which I beare vnto her husband Ma∣ster Arthur Gorges, a louer of learning and vertue, whose house, as your Ladiship by mariage hath honou∣red, so doe I find the name of them by many notable re∣cords, to be of great antiquitie in this Realme; and such as haue euer borne themselues with honoarable reputa∣tion to the world, & vnspotted loyaltie to their Prince and Countrey: besides so lineally are they descended from the Howards, as that the Lady Anne Howard, eldest daughter to Iohn Duke of Norfolke, was wife
to Sir Edmund, mother to Sir Edward, and grand∣mother to Sir William and Sir Thomas Gorges Knightes. And therefore I doe assure my selfe, that no due honour done to the white Lyon, but will be most gratefull to your Ladiship, whose husband and chil∣dren do so neerely participate with the bloud of that noble family. So in all dutie I recommende this Pam∣phlet, and the good acceptance thereof, to your ho∣nourable fauour and protection. London this first of Ianuarie. 1591.
