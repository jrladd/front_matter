My Lord,
AS the Tempers of men are different, so are their Conditions, according as they are placed by Pro∣vidence, Nature, or their Industry; but all priviledged men, whether with nobleness of Birth, ful∣ness of Riches, or greatness of Parts, and Vertue, are equally bound in their station to act according to the mea∣sure of their power.
They who are in elevations ought

to avoid making idols or cyphers of themselves; as if they were thus placed only for their own sake, or for a shew to others: but the higher they are, the nearer they are to God; and the more lively images of him, whose influences are more immedi∣ately derived on them; not there to rest, but to be imparted to those of an orb inferior to theirs; which ends, if they do not answer, they may well look upon themselves in their eleva∣tion as standing on the edg of a dread∣ful precipice. For the higher they are lifted up, the greater and more dan∣gerous will be their fall; and to their own shame they will undergo the fate of those fiery vapours, elevated in the air; which to the eyes of men seem to be Stars, and placed amongst them; but on a sudden, by their fall, vanish away; and then it appears what they were, namely, an illusion without reality. No man endued with

Judgment and Reason, will believe him who acts the part of a Prince up∣on the Stage (though for a time he borrows Royal Ornaments, and as∣sumes over his equals a Sovereign Au∣thority) to be indeed what he seems and pretends to be; 'tis so but for a time, and to give delight to his Spe∣ctators: so will he off, who being a man of quality, is useless to those, who, because he is above them, have their eyes fixed upon him, and gives them neither good Precepts, Advises, nor Examples. There is no Star but hath its influences within her sphere, no good Tree but produces good Fruit; but he who is noble, and doth not act his part, is but a vain shadow.
Your Lordship knows, and is con∣cerned to know these things; for not only you are born to be under our Sovereign, one of the chief Pillars of the State, as a member of the most illustrious House of Peers, whereof

few go before you; but also you are so highly advantaged by your Birth, that the Blood of many Princes runs in your Veins. This Priviledge is so far improved by the care and ten∣derness of the extraordinary Person who brought you into the world, and your own good dispositions, that in your Lordship we find this to be true, Men of a superior Orb are not tied to common Rules, neither doth ver∣tue in such persons as you, stay for years. You make a good use of such advantages, and in your Lordship these good causes produce good ef∣fects: that which into others would in∣fuse pride and loftiness, in you breeds meekness and humility; so that you never give occasion to the ordinary dispute in the world, between Supe∣riors and Inferiors, caused by want and excess, too little, and too much; for often great men are apt to require and exact too great respects and sub∣mission

from the lower sort, who, on their parts, are too prone to deny yielding the Honour and Obedience which they owe to those who are above them.
My heart not satisfied some years ago to have vowed it self to serve your Lordship, is now ambitious to make it known to the world; and that which first of all was the effect of a choice, being attended with my inclination, is at last become a strong and necessary duty, grounded upon those Vertues, which, for a competent time, I could perceive to spring in you, but now are ripening and draw∣ing towards perfection: whereupon I must express my joy to your Lord∣ship, pray for an increase, and beseech him who will honour those that honour him, to make you like a new shining Star in the Firmament of the State, to raise you from one degree of light to another; that you may have Chri∣stian

and wise influences over those that are round about you, and to sea∣son your tender years with his true Grace, which none will be more glad of, than
Right Honorable,
