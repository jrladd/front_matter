TO that cleare Maiestie, which in the North,
Doth like another Sunne in glorie rise,
VVhich standeth fixt, yet spreds her heauenly worth,
Loadstone to Hearts, and Loadstarre to all Eyes;


Like Heau'n in all; like th'Earth in this alone,
That though great States by her support do stand,
Yet she her selfe supported is of none,
But by the Finger of th' Almighties hand;


To the diuinest and the richest minde,
Both by Arts purchase, and by Natures Dower,
That euer was from Heauen to Earth confin'd,
To shew the vtmost of a Creatures power;


To that great Spirit, which doth great Kingdomes moue,
The sacred Spring, whence Right and Honor streames,
Distilling Vertue, shedding peace and Loue,
In euery place, as Cynthia sheds her beames;



I offer vp some sparkles of that fire,
VVhereby we reason, liue, and moue, and bee:
These sparkes by nature euermore aspire,
VVhich makes them to so high an Highnesse flee.


Faire Soule, since to the fairest bodie knit,
You giue such liuely life, such quickning power,
Such sweete celestiall influence to it,
As keepes it still in youths immortall flower,


(As where the Sunne is present all the yeare,
And neuer doth retire his golden ray,
Needs must the Spring be euerlasting there,
And euery season like the Mon'th of May.)


O many, many yeares may you remaine,
A happie Angell to this happie Land:
Long, long, may you on earth our Empresse raigne,
Ere you in Heauen a glorious Angell stand;


Stay long (sweet Spirit) ere thou to Heauen depart,
VVhich mak'st each place a Heauen wherin thou art.
