MY LORD,
THis being my first Essay in Print, I thought I could not but in duty present

it to your Lordship, as being a Description of that Re∣nowned Court and Kingdom, wherein your Lordship, as upon a Most Illustrious Thea∣ter, Signaliz'd your Self with so much Reputation to your Self and Country, and Mu∣tual Satisfaction to those great Princes, between whom you were so successful an Instru∣ment of that good Corre∣spondence, that has not a lit∣tle Contributed to the Hap∣piness of Both Monarchies, the most Flourishing at pre∣sent of Europe.
And indeed, France, my Lord, being the Place too, wherein I was honoured and

made happy, by so many of your Lordship's Favours, what more Congruous Mark, could I give you, of the Lasting and deeply Impressed Sense, I have of them, than the Pre∣sent, I humbly make you of France it Self, or at least of this small Prospect of so vast a Monarchy? A Present, which (though perhaps inconsider∣able on the account of the Im∣perfections it may have con∣tracted from it's Author) will, I hope, be grateful, in respect of its noble Subject, and by your accustomed Goodness, be accepted as a Cordial Testi∣mony, of the real Gratitude, and Profound Respect, I have

and shall ever preserve, for your Honour, of whom, I am,
My Lord,
