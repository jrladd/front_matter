RIght Honorable,
I knew I could not bestow
my thoughts better than
vpon Gods owne histo∣rie,
so full of edification and delight:
which I haue in such sort indeuoured to
doe, that I shall giue occasion to my
Reader of some meditations, which
perhaps hee would haue missed. Euery

helpe in this kinde deserues to be preci∣ous.
I present the first part to your
Honour, wherein you shall see the
world both made, and smoothered a∣gaine:
Man in the glorie of his crea∣tion,
and the shame of his fall: Para∣dise
at once made and lost. The
first man killing his seede, the second
his brother. If in these I shall giue
light to the thoughts of any Reader, let
him with me giue the praise to him from
whom that light shone foorth to me.
To whose grace and protection
I humbly commend your
Lordship: as
