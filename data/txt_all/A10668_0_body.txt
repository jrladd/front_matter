SIR,
AS Rivers, though in their passing they fall in∣to many neighbour Currents yet finally emp∣ty themselves into the Sea, so let these my poore Labours (though formerly Dedicated to divers Illustrious Peeres of this your Realme) bee suffered at last to terminate in the Ocean of your Princely Greatnesse and Goodnesse, whereinto all vertuous endeavours (as so many lines in their Centre) desire to be united.
What private respests might challenge of me towards their Honors, the same towards your Majesty will claime the publicke Bond of Common Allegiance, whereby I am more eminently, and more universally obliged. I am not so over weening of my weake Endeavours, as to thinke them wor∣thy

of your Majesties view, much lesse able to adde any thing to your Royall Uertues; Rivers adde nothing to the Maine, yet thither they naturally send the Tribute of their Streames; and if my Loyaltie reach me to doe the like, it will not (I hope) be conceived as done out of an opini∣on of Merit, but onely out of a desire to discharge the Duty of a Subject to your Majestie.
And I am the rather imboldned to this Confidence, because I have formerly adventured the like, when to your Princely View, being then the Second Hope of this Kingdome, I (about eleven yeares since) presented a Translation of a Worke of Monsieur de Refuges, intituled A Treatise of the Court; the Gratious and Undeserved Acceptance whereof, if it hath inspired me with farther Courage, to present You (now advan∣ced to a greater State) with a greater Increase of mine owne Labour, your Majestie will not (I hope) condemne me of groundlesse Presumption.
The former three Bookes had the Honour and Happinesse to bee perused by the Iudicious Eye of King IAMES, your Renowned Father, (of happy Memory) In whose incompa∣rable Iudgement they failed not of Approbation, though De∣dicated to Inferiour Names; the more am I now incouraged to Inscribe and Intitle the whole Sixe to your Sacred Majesty, as being no lesse Heire of His Uertues, then of His Crowne and Dignitie.
And one thing more (arising from the Consideration of the Subject it selfe) made me thinke it a Present not altoge∣ther unworthy of your Regall Estate; for the Contents of it being the Execution of Iustice, upon the unnaturall Sinne of Murther, where can it bee more fitly addressed, then to the Great Patron of Iustice among us (God's immediate Vice∣gerent) by whose Sword (as the Minister of Heaven) such

odious Crimes are to bee chastised, and Innocent Bloud justly expiated with Guilty.
And it may more fitly sute with your Majesty, who as you ex∣cell in the carefull Administration of Iustice upon all Offen∣ders, so especially upon those (most hainous of all others) the Violaters of Gods sacred Image, in the perpetration of wilfull Murther, towards whom Clemencie even changeth her na∣ture, and becomes Cruelty to the Weal-publicke. Never had any Land lesse cause to complaine of too much Indulgencie this way, then ours, as may well appeare, both by the rarenesse of such Occurrences in your Kingdome, and the severe vindi∣cation of them, whensoever they happen, or by whom, or how∣soever performed.
These Histories therefore, which may serve as a Looking∣glasse to all Nations, shall to these of Yours be a speciall Or∣nament and Mirrour of their felicity, and set forth and publish Your Praise, in the peaceable and quiet Government of your People, whose Climate (seldome or never) affords such Tra∣gedies; nor will doe, whiles Your Christian resolution shall continue to prevent them in the Spring, and to punish the ligh∣ter degrees of Bloudinesse with due retaliation. The great Author of Iustice (who is Goodnesse and Iustice it selfe) long preserve your Majesty to Vs, and the Happinesse Wee enjoy in your Sacred Person, so neere resembling Him whose Authority and Image You beare. So prayeth
