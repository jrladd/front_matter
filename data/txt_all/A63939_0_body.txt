Sir and Madam,
MY Design is not to offer you here any Flattering Encomium, but to acknowledge a Score that I have run upon in your Books for some time; to make a little Apology for the seeming negligence and for∣getfulness
I have been guilty of: And this I the rather do, be∣cause you will guess by these Pre∣sents, not only that I am alive, but the Favours you have some∣time shewed me are alive in my thoughts too: Only my self lie half-buried in Cares and Books; so that I want leisure to pay my Debts and Devoirs in due time and manner; and faculty to do it in due measure. Be pleased to contemplate a little while with me here the Beauty of the Outward Parts of Heaven, and thence make conjecture at the Wisdom of Him that made the World, and the Provision He hath made in the Highest Heavens, for all that Love and Obey Him in Truth. This is but a Harbinger for a more Compleat History of Divine Providence, designed e're long for the Press. It cannot be improper
certainly to Ascend Pisgah by de∣grees; (we may see the Outward Skirts of Heaven from the Foot of the Mount. When we can get to the Top, our desire is to take a pro∣spect of the whole Hemisphere; to leave the Stars, whilst we make enquiry after all the Invisible Host of the Middle Region, that are em∣ployed about us either as Friends or Enemies. The God of Heaven make your Graces shine more and more in the mean time, that they may outshine and outlast the Stars, and you your selves be fixed in their room for ever; so pray I for you, pray you so for,
Worshipful Sir and Worthy Madam,
