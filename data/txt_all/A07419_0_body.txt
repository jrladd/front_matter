LOuing and welbelo∣ued Naearchus, being oftē & earnestly solli∣cited by you, to sette downe a patterne of such discourses, as in priuate haue past many times betwixt vs, concerning seuerall and distinct affectes, and af∣fectations of many vsurping vaine-glorious Politicians, as also what my
conceipt and opinion was, and is of a perfect statesmā most to be respected: And at this time finding my selfe de∣priued through sicknes of other bodi∣ly functions, I haue endeuoured to sa∣tisfie your request, so well as the day∣ly incomberance of so vnwelcome and trouble some a guest, would giue mee leaue and leasure; What I haue sette downe will assuredlye offend no creature that liues within the com∣passe of right & perfect iudgement: and if any thing heerein may giue you the least taste of pleasure and content, I shall think my trauell ritchly rewar∣ded, and be incouraged to supplye your desires in the like succeeding moti∣ons.
