SIR,
THIS Discourse, which was so acceptable to You from the Pulpit, comes now in all Humility from the Press to offer it self to your further Acceptance, and Protection, and to the Perusal of all those Learned, and Orthodox men, who desired me to Publish it, as containing some Sober, and wholsom doctrines, which they judged seasona∣ble for the age. I had a mind to satisfie my self in this Subject, and having by Gods blessing upon my enquiries attained to sa∣tisfaction in them, I framed my Observations on purpose into a Sermon, to see if happily I could satisfie other mens reasons, by the same Arguments, by which I had convinced my own. And because the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets, I chose to Preach it in that Audience, where are al∣ways so many Competent and able Judges of Truth and Error, and what I said on that obscure Subject (as Chrysostom calls it) having been approved therein, I am encouraged to hope, that it will find the like Entertainment in other places, especi∣ally among all ingenuous spirits, who are wont to read with unprejudiced minds. But lest any should think, that the Scheme, by which I go in this Discourse, were an Hypothesis of my own inventing, I have confirmed the passages in it,
 which I thought would be most surprizing, with good Autho∣rities: because how plausible soever any Notions in Divinity may be, yet they may reasonably pass for suspected, unless they appear to be agreeable to the Sentiments of the Writers of the Oecumenical Church. To write all things consonantly to Ca∣tholick Antiquity is a safe and excellent rule, and it is for ad∣hering to it in her Doctrine and Discipline, that the Church of England, and Her Clergy have been always persecuted by the Papists, those Pseudo-Catholicks on one hand, and their Instruments, the Anti-Prelatical Sects on the other; and because under God the Ʋniversities are the support of the Church, therefore have they been decryed for want of Learn∣ing by those, and want of Virtue and Religion by these, al∣though they have been, and are as fruitful Seminaries of both, as any Schools, or Ʋniversities that are, or ever were in the world. And now having occasion to speak of the Ʋniversities, it would be real injustice to your Merits, not to let the world know, how happy ours is in Your Government. I might justly speak great things of Your Severity in punishing of Vice, of the great encouragement you give to Virtue, and Learning, and of your Care and Vigilance both over your own Colledge, and the Ʋniversity, particularly in giving life to the Publick Exercises in the Schools, of which you are in all Arts and Fa∣culties so great a Judge. It is under such Governours as You, that the Muses will flourish in Oxford, and that true Learn∣ing, and Sound Religion will always be taught therein. And therefore that there may never want a Succession of such Vice-Chancellours as You to Govern that Famous Ʋniversity, nor of such Learned Masters, and Scholars, as now adorn it, is the hearty prayer of,
SIR,
