RIght Honorable, the ma∣nifold testimonies of your loue both vnto Honor and Armes, haue induced me to think the first sight of this small booke doth of right belong vnto your Lordship, being by the due degrees of vertue as∣cended to that place, which among others in this Realme, is (and long hath been) reputed most honorable. To your L. therefore I humblie dedicate the same, as vnto him, that by censure of our Soueraigne, with the applause of people, hath in hand the consideration of actions ap∣perteining to equitie, Honor and Iustice. The

propertie of which vertue (as Cicero saith) is to foresee that no violence be offered, but on∣lie by him that with iniurie is thereunto prouo∣ked: and that things common should bee com∣monlie vsed, and priuate things priuatlie en∣ioyed. By which rule appeareth, that vertue al∣loweth iust reuenge, and admitteth the defence of propertie and right. But for that your Lord∣ship hath been as well an actor in Armes, as a knower of what is due to Honor, I omit to say more, either of the one or the other: beseeching your good Lordship to pardon my boldnesse, and take in acceptable wise the entent of the Au∣thor, who both by election and obligation ac∣knowledgeth himself yours.
