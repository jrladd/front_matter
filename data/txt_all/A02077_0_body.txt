MYRON, that vnskilful Painter of Greece, neuer drew any picture, but the counterfait of Iupiter: saying, that if it were ill wrought, his worthinesse should countenance out the meannesse of his work, if well, commend the perection of his Art.
In like manner fareth it with me (right Honourable) who haing vnâˆ£skilfully shadowed wih bad colours, the counterfait of Fortune, presume boldly to shrowde it vnder your Ladiships patronage, as able to defend it, be it neuer so meane, and to countenance it, were it neuer so good. Thus hopefull of your Ladiships acceptance, I remaine,
