RIght Noble Sir, this Pamphlet is for the most part such notes as I had taken some five or six yeers sithence for mine owne private use, but now have made it for the use of my friends also; And howsoever (for want of such a dresse as Learning might have set it forth in) it hath lost that grace which otherwayes it might have had; yet by reason of the matter, I assure my selfe it will be of some account with so many as preferre substance before shadowes; which hath made me adventure the publishing of it, though no better furnished then you see; and the sure know∣ledge
of your noble disposition and former experi∣ence of your favour, hath imboldened me to present this little Booke unto your Honour, being well as∣sured, that by your Patronage, it will finde the more favourable entertainment, especially amongst some, which otherwise, perhaps, would have scornfully rejected it, and it may be, will tax me of, resum∣ption, that for the credit of a trifle, shall crave the as∣sistance of so eminent a person, but my duty and true affection to your Honour, and hope of your pardon, hath made mee wilfully repell all reasons that might disswade me. Accept therefore, I beseech your Honour, this small gift, as King Artaxerxes did the water which a poore man brought in his hands and gave him, who received it with a smiling and cheerefull countenance, measuring the gift, not according to the value, but according to his good will that gave it; and thought it no lesse an act of Kingly greatnesse, to take small presents in good part, then to give greater: neither is any eminence disgraced by so doing. I think it needlesse to trouble your Honour with many words of entreaty, and therefore conclude, wishing your Honour all hap∣pinesse here and hereafter,
