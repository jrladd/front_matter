Gentlemen.
THIS mean discourse that you were pleased so kindly to entertain at the hearing of, and so devoutly to joyn with me in the purpose of; I offer now to you, as justly your own.
To the end, that amidst the many Honest and Loyal Addresses at present, in which good Men congratulate the safety of their Prince, and make fresh Vows of Loyalty and Service to him; we may do something to interest Religion in this affair. Not only Sacrifice to that God, from whom this safety so sig∣nally derives, but also ingage his Pro∣vidence
 and blessing, for the continuance of it, without which the utmost care and Loyalty of Subjects are but feeble things.
It may serve you as a kind of Parasceve to the great and publick Eucharist, that (I am confident) you will shortly be called unto; In which I shall be glad to do you further Service, and in every thing else, wherein I may approve my self,
July the 16th. 1683.
