WHen this Sermon was first Prea∣ched it was vulgarly said, that it was boldly done; but (if I mistake not) it is much more bold and daring to cause it to be made publick. Speed it as it may, I am sufficiently pleased that in this juncture of Affairs (when Allegiance is made a Crime, and Conformity little better than In∣fidelity,) I have Patrons able and ready to assert the interest of them both; The one a lineal descendant of my Original Patron, and
 I hope Succession in this case is no ways Cri∣minal; the other of a Family no less Loyal, and if that be Criminal I beg no ones pardon. My Prayer is, and ever shall be, That none of you may degenerate, or in the least be tempted to look awry; and howbeit others are too too apt to despise the Priesthood, (and perhaps the more because they are Loyal and True to David and his Family,) yet may the Blessing thereof always descend upon you, and upon all that descend from, or belong unto you; and this is, and shall be the daily Prayer of

Long Melford. Suff. 29 May. 1682.
