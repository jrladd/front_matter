TO me thy Fauour, to thee my Relation
Doe tie mee in a double Obligation:
These Graces fiue to thee to dedicate,
Which best I think thy worth accommodate;
Who art the bounteous Almener of the King
Of Bounty; whose great wisdome did thee bring
For thy large spirit, and well tempred zeale
His Temples broken head and sides to heale:
Whose loue to Knowledge Humane & Diuine,
As in the Schooles, so in the Church doth shine.
These outward Vertues: plainly doe declare,
What inward Graces in thee likewise are:
The chiefe is spirituall Ioy; which in thy Breast,
God make thee feele, as wee doe see the rest.

Your Lordships bounden in all dutie and seruice,
ROBERT AYLETT.
