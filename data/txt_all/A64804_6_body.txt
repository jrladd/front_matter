My Lord,
I Shall not be tedious in informing Your Lordship of the reasons which induc'd me to this Dedication. Your most Heroick Ancestors being alwayes the truest defenders of Loy∣alty, and eminentest Patterns of Valour; your Lordships particular disposition and affection to Martial acts, the Expe∣rience you have had in the Fortifications abroad, have Intituled you to the Patronage of these my Addresses, and given you the undoubted right to be a fit Judge of all Military designs whatsoever. And though the
 particular favours and kindnesses which I have re∣ceiv'd from your Honourable Family (as owing my Education to the bounty of it) have sufficient force to oblige me to a most humble and grateful acknowledg∣ment, yet in this case I laid aside those considerations, and had respect only to your Lordships self as a Souldier, furnish'd with all that may render you capable to exa∣mine either this, or any other Martial Treatise.
I am confident, My Lord, the Book in it self, how meanly soever by me Translated out of the Latine, will not be unworthy your Lordships favourable aspect, it being the Easiest and Exactest of that Nature that ever yet was Extant, having been compiled from all Authors that have treated of that Subject by Andrew Tacquett of the Society of Jesus, for the use of his Pupil Count d' Horne of Flanders. The new Cor∣rections of the Count d' Pagan, and Van Ruse, that we all so admire, but no body practises, is not here so much as spoke of; he thinking it best that men should be well grounded in the old wayes; afterwards for divertisement they may follow what Novelties they please. I shall not insist further on the praises of the Author, or obtrude him upon your Lordship by nume∣rous commendations: If at your vacant hours you shall vouchsafe to cast an Eye upon him, I do not doubt but you will give him the esteem he deserves, and favourably accept the poor Endeavours of him who is willing to omit no opportunity of testifying himself,
MY LORD,
