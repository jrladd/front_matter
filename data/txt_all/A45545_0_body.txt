My Lords,
SHort warning is some Apolo∣gy
for slender Performance;
however what I cannot further
fairly excuse, I hope your goodnesse will
freely pardon.
It was enough you were pleased to put
your ears to the penance of hearing,
but much you should put your eyes to the



expence of patience in reading this
unpolished Discourse; Such as it is, in
obedience to your Honours command
I humbly tender to your acceptance.
The great hopes which divine pro∣vidence
hath given us of an happy set∣tlement
by your Free Convention,
prompted my thoughts to this Subject;
and it fell out very sutably, that after my
Reverend Brother had minded you of
the duty of humbling your selves, the com∣fortable
Message of Peace should be
presented to you.
The day of your Fast was according to
Ecclesiasticall denomination the Eve of a
Feast, and that a Conjunction of those two
Apostles of Christ Philip and James; and
(blessed be our gracious God) it was the eve
of a day truly festivall, upon a civill ac∣count,



on which that knot between his Ma∣jesty
and his people began to be tyed,
which I trust shall neither be untyed by sub∣tlety,
nor cut asunder by violence.
From this May-day we promise our
selves (through Gods mercy) a pleasant
Spring, yea, a joyful Summer of pro∣sperity,
after a cold Winter of tribulati∣on;
especially since we finde it seconded with
another day of a free and full, publique and
peaceable Proclamation of our Sove∣raign
Lord King Charles, his un∣doubted
Right to these Realms, of which
he hath so long, no lesse unjustly in respect of
him, than unhappily in respect of us, been
deprived: a day wherein the fruit of (al∣most)
all mens lips, was that joyfull accla∣mation
and hearty supplication; God
save the King.


And now (My Lords) be pleased to
go on resolutely, unanimously in
finishing this blessed work; Be zea∣lous
for the glory of God, the honor
of his Majesty, the prosperity of the
Church; and tranquillity of the
kingdom, so shall you be dearly beloved
of God, and highly honoured of men.
Commending your pious and loyall en∣deavours
to the blessing, and your no∣ble
Persons to the grace of God, I take
leave, subscribing my self,
