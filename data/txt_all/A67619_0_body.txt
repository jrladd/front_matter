Right Honorable!
IT's not my abilitie, but the force of the Caus, and necessitie of this task (others of better parts beeing silent) that prompt mee to challenge an interest in your ho∣nor's patronage of my weak endeavors in asserting the English interest in Ire∣land, against a more dangerous then known stickler for the Irish, and their gangren'd Caus, discovering himself in som pernicious Queres, cunningly dispersed at such a season, wherein they might have a full influ∣ence upon the common genius of the Armie, then designed for Ireland: And finding light sufficient in my self from such experimental truths, as lodg in my own bosom, to discover the Querist's Prestigies; I have adventured a little to draw the curtain, and make way for som more fit and able, to vindicate the just interest of England, against their causless and implacable enemies, the barbarous Irish Rebels. This piece beeing onely intended as an incitement thereunto. And such it will surely prove, if it finde your honor's fa∣vourable aspect, and the like approbation from those other wise steers-men, whom the Lord hath placed at the helm of
this Nation's Government: And for those adherents to the Irish, whose mindes are fore-stalled, and carried away with the stream of their fals asseverations, and lose the re∣putation of their modestie in the Irish impudencie, (although I wish they may bee in their Judgments rectified, and man∣ners reformed,) yet I value not their carpings nor vain ex∣ceptions; Quia Momus nunquam gnarus est. I onely beg your honor's acceptance of these lines from my poor hand, so as my joies may bee continued in the memorie of your good Acts; my affection owe's a dutie to the performance of this work, which will at last toll in better Ringers, prostrate∣ing my endeavors at the feet of your honors, as those of a sublime understanding.
