Dread Soveraign,
THese following endevours ha∣ving been brought first of all before Your Sacred Majesty, who did not then despise the day of small things, but out of Your Princely Favour granted Access, and had the patience to hear the Reasons and Objections; Your Heroick Breast being truly inspired and persuaded, that the greatest Mysteries and Matters in the world, were first made known and discovered by plain men, and hid from the Learned; and so to this day the greatest pretended natural knowledges are still over-ruled by practical Proof-pieces; upon which considerations Your Majesties faithful Subjects Robert Theaker and Charles Saltonstall, after much expences of money and time, are now endevouring to en∣able all practical Sea-men, with the full know∣ledg of this Instrument; and in regard Charles Saltonstall hath made several long Voyages and
 Discoveries, instructed and brought up a con∣siderable number of expert Navigators, (many of them being now in your Majesties Service) it is hoped in time he will also enable them with this knowledg, that their Proof-pieces may give an end to all Objections: In which hope for the present I humbly lay all down at Your Majesties Feet, beseeching a favourable acceptance of this Mite, which may prove more worth than the offerings of abundance. And so in all obedience I submit my self to Your Majesties Princely good will and plea∣sure, desiring the great God of Heaven and Earth to grant Your Majesty a long, prospe∣rous, and happy Reign.
