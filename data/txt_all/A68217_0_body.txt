Christian Lady:
I Present you (here) with some fruits of my age, the root (out of which they sprung) standeth in that fa∣mous historie of a Woman
of rare Faith; and because a Woman, therefore the fit∣ter to be commended to you, and this for the truths sake that dwelleth in you. This truth is that noble Guest that takes vp lodging no where, but in a heart, such as is according to the faith of Gods elect.

And now for this, and for the sweet chil∣dren of your body, likewise for the Parent of them, your most louing Husband, and my most kinde Patron, I doe, and still pray, who am
