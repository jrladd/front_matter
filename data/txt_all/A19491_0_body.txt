IT is a no∣table say∣ing of the Apostle, If in this life onely we haue hope in Christ,1 Cor. 15.19 wee are of all

mē the most miserable: For, whereas others be∣ing ignorant of beter things to come, set their harts on these, which are present: if wee despising such comforts as now we may enioy, should also be disapointed of those, which afterwards we looke for, Our case indeede were most lamentable: but praised be God, it is farre otherwise; for where the comfot of the world∣ling ends, there the grea∣test comfort of the Chri∣stian beginnes.Psal. 17.14 The men of this world (saies Da∣uid) haue their portion

in this life:Luk▪ 6.24. yea our Sa∣uiour saith, They haue receiued their consolati∣on here.Luke 16. It was spoken in that Parable by Abra∣ham to Diues, Remem∣ber that in thy life thou receiuedst thy pleasures: And it appertaines to all the wicked: better things then these, which prsent∣ly they see, neede they ne∣uer to looke for. And therfore no maruell, that as the taste of the Colo∣quint, or wilde Gourd, made the children of the Prophets abhor thei meat, so the taste of death make all the pleasures &

refreshments of their life loathsome to them. Or as the hand which wrote to Beltazar on the wall his imminent iudgment, did in a moment turn all the solace of that house into sorrow, for the Kings countenance was chaun∣ged, his thoughts troub∣led, his Princes astonish∣ed, his Musitians silen∣ced, his seruants amazed, their delightfull drink∣ing became despised, and all the house disordered: and in a worde, his Ban∣quet concluded with a cuppe of wrath, sent to him from the Lord: so

is it vnto all the wicked; the smallest signification of death interrupts their greatest ioyes, and causes them with the Peacocke, looking to his feet, let fall the proude feathers of their hie concetes with∣in their owne mindes, what euer they pretend in countenance. As is the noise of thornes vn∣der the potte, so is the laughter of fooles, saieth Salomon,Eccles. 7.8. both the one and the other quickely vanishes: and death like that worme, which eated vp the gourd of Ionas, deuoures at length all

their Worme-eaten plea∣sures, and then woe be to them, When all these fat, and excellent things,Reu. 18.14 af∣ter which their soule lu∣sted, are departed from them, and not so much as any hope of better re∣maines vnto them: But vnto the Christian, death can doe no more but de∣molish this parpen wall of clay, within the which the soule is captiued for a time, it opens the doore of the prison, and giues li∣berty to the soule, to goe out and returne to her Maker, as shal at greater length appeare in the

Treatis following, which I haue offered, and pre∣sented to your Honour, partly to testifie my vn∣feined affection toward you in the Lord; for that vnfeined and incorrupt loue, which in so corrupt a time ye haue alway car∣ried toward the truth of the Gospell, and by which also ye haue liued, as rare examples of pietie and loue, & godly liberality, and partly that ye may be remembred of these in∣structions concerning life and death: wich ye receiued from vs by hea¦ring, during your resi∣dence

with vs, and vnto the practise whereof shortly ye must be called: for albeit it is not long, since it pleased the Lord beyond all expectation of man to deliuer you out of the handes of the Serge∣ants & officers of death, which had violently sea∣sed vpon you, and threat∣ned to slay you both, your selfe by sickenesse, your Ladie by the sorrow of desolation, more heauie then death vnto her: yet are yee to knowe (and I doubt not, are preparing o for it) that the same battell will shortly bee re∣nued

against you, wherin both of you must bee di∣uorced from other, and diuided from your owne bodies, that yee may bee married and conioyne with your Lord, whom ye haue not yet seene,1. Pet. 1. but long to see him, because ye loue him, and reioyce in him with ioy vnspeak¦able and glorious. And herein, if these little fruites of my Ministery may serue any way to con∣firme you in the end, as some way they haue com∣forted you in the iourney: and if for your sake they may bee profitable to o∣thers

who, cōstantly keeps with you the same course toward the face of Iesus Christ, it shall be no small comfort vnto me, know∣ing thereby that I haue not runne, nor laboured in vaine; for there is no thing in the world I de∣sire more, then that I may put my talent to the vt∣termost profite, fulfilling with ioy the Ministrati∣on I haue receiued, and so may be welcommed of my Lord, as one who hath beene faithfull in little: But because all encrease comes from God, I humb∣ly commend you, and al

that loue the Lord Iesus to the grace of God which is able to build you fur∣ther, and giue you inhe∣ritance among them who are sanctified by faith in Christ, and so rest
