MAdame, albeit the first subiect moouing me to write this Treatise of Specters, was principally to confute certaine auncient Philosophers, Atheists and Libertines, who did hold and maintaine this opinion, that there were not any substances in being, but such on∣ly as were corporall and having bodies: Yet so it is, that I have not herein imployed my pen agaynst those whom both all the Bookes of the whole worlde, and venerable antiquitie, and even Nature it selfe have condemned: so much as I have done agaynst certaine perverse spi∣rits and brainsicke persons of our age, who have inven∣ted most strange and variable opinions: as also agaynst some new Dogmatists, who to the intent they might se∣cretly insinuate (as IThis is but a suppose; For it is no consequence, because the soules of dead men appeare not, that ther∣fore they are not. suppose) into the minds of men, an error of the Epicures: That the soules of men have no being after death) have altogether denied their ap∣parition. Howbeit, that all the Doctours of the Church doe confute them: and Saint Ierome particularly hath written thereof, a certaine Booke agaynst Vigilantius the Gaule: wherein he sheweth by lively reasons, that the soules of the Saints after their dissolution may haunt or frequent these inferiour places. Now (Madame, I
knowing that you have in detestation all such Dogma∣tists, and that your desire is above all things, that our France should be purged of such monsters: which (as the same Saint Ierome writeth to Vigilantius) could ne∣ver endure or suffer such persons: My desire was that this woorke of mine shoulde come foorth vnder the name of your Highnesse, to the intent the same might march the more hardily vnder your fauour throughout France, in despite of all detractions, and malignant per∣sons: who will so much the more feare to assaile or re∣prove it, when they shall see that it is vnder your pro∣tection and defence: and that you have with a gratious countenance receyved it. Madame, I pray God the Creator to give you long life, with encrease of greatnesse and prosperitie.
From Angiers this 21. of Iune 1586.
