YOur earnest request in the Lord (most heartely beloued in him) was, that I would put in writte to you those first Sermons, which, at the will of God, I preached amongst you. J confesse that I am obliged to you all, in all duties of love, because of the abundance of your love to me, or rather to the Lord Iesus. Therfore, although the cōsciēce of my weaknes & in∣firmitie did ever, till this houre, hold me back frō writing or presēting in writte any of my weake labours to the vse of any yet, I could not resist your lawful & earnest desire in this particular; praying God to direct it to his glo∣rie & your comfort. Receive thē the first two conceaved in substance as I deliuered them, but in larged according to the speciall conso∣latiōs, which it pleased the Lord to minister vnto my owne heart out of this Scripture, in time of my most heavie sickenes, when J was dayly in hope to goe out of this body to dwell with the Lord. If yee finde any comfort in them, give all the glory to him who is able by
the mouth of Babes and Sucklings, to make perfect his prayse. And not staying as Babes vpon the vse of this milke, goe on in strength by the solide comfort of that strong meate, which yee have abundantly in the Lords great mercie dayly ministred vnto you, by the painfull labours and faithfull watch∣fulnes of your louing and learned Pastour, whom the Lord hath taught to be a Scribe in his kingdome, a faithfull and wise steward to give his children their portion of meate in season, at whose mouth receiving that sincere milke of the word, ye shall doubtles grow vp to be a spirituall house & an holy Priesthood to God by Iesus Christ our Lord, whose spe∣cial blessing J pray for to his worke amongst you, that you to your Pastour, and he to you, may be a ioy, a glorie, and a crowne of reioy∣sing in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ at his comming, whose grace, mercie and peace be with you all. Amen.
