Honoured Sir,
TO You are due these First-Fruits of my Learn∣ing; By whose Bounty and Care, (together with God's Blessing) I accomplisht my Ty∣rocinium under You, in the space of half an Appren∣ticeship. And 'tis to You, Sir, that I must stand in∣debted for all those Superstructures, which either alrea∣dy are, or hereafter shall be built upon that good Foun∣dation that You have laid. This is a Tract I at first Composed for a Kinsman, committed to my Care; upon whom I try'd the Experiment, and found it to answer my utmost Expectation. And hoping it may prove Be∣neficial to the Publick, I have ventured to Print it, From those I have discoursed about it, I have met with no Objections against it, but what seem to arise from an unwillingness to forsake the Old Way: But if the Gentlemen of our Faculty would but please to consider,
 That no one man knows all things: And that no Art is yet arriv'd to the height of its Perfection, they might, perhaps, allow me to spy out one thing, overlookt by our Wise Predecessors, without the imputation of Ar∣rogance.
Sir, I have made bold to prefix Your Name to it; without the least Intimation before hand; Because here∣by You are no wayes obliged to vindicate my Errors; Which if You please to let me know, by my Correcting of them, You shall find that I am still,
Honoured Sir,

Stoke-Newington, Dec. 7. 1684
