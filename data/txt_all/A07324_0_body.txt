SIR,
I SHOVLD haue taught my hum∣ble labors a lower presumption than to haue approached your sa∣cred hand, if I had onely

weighed mine owne weak∣nesse and disabilitie; but the dignitie of this subiect did somewhat encourage mee, being a remainder of that great Historie, whose for∣mer part was so richly dres∣sed in the happie conceits, and high raptures of that Noble LVCAN: of whose abilitie in writing I was not so ambitious in emulation, as officious in desire, to con∣tinue so stately an argument for your Princely eare: with what successe I haue perfor∣med

it, your MAIESTIES acceptation onely can deter∣mine; to whom if it present but the least delight, my end is accomplished, for which I haue runne so great a ha∣zard, as (perchance) to be censured a foile onely to Lucan's lustre; and chose ra∣ther to fall vnder the weight of a great argument, than to present a meane one to so high a hand: your Maiesties renowned worth, and He∣roicall vertues (the perfecti∣on of minde meeting in you

with the height of Fortune) may make you securely de∣lighted in the reading of great actions; to whom I humbly present this weake Worke, beseeching Al∣mighty GOD long to esta∣blish your MAIESTIES Throne vpon earth, enrich∣ing it with blessings of the right hand and the left; and after to Crowne you with incorruptible Glorie: So prayeth
