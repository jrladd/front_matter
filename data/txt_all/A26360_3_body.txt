My LORD,
YOur Name is here prefixed to the Ensuing Discourse, neither for Charm nor Amu∣ to save it from the Rude and Censorious; for it doth not at all gard what Entertainment it meets ith at such hands. But it assumes is Honour upon the Account of s Author, who having the Happi∣ess to be one of your Diocesan Clergy, thinks all he can perform
 in that Relation, ought to be devo∣ted to your Lordship, as a sincere Testimony of his bounden acknow∣ledging your Paternal Government.
I need not represent to your Lordship the many and great Evils which are befaln this Church, through a want of duly observing what this Discourse commends. For as your Singular Prudence labours to redress, and your Pious Soul deeply resents them; so your Great Dis∣cernment plainly sees that they are scarce (now) to be removed by any other Method, but a timely, dili∣gent and Regular Catechising. And that the most likely means to esta∣blish Truth and Holiness with Po∣sterity, is firmly and early to imprint the Younger Minds, who are the hopes of Religion, with that Cate∣chism which our Church out of her singular prudence and affection hath provided for them.
But I may not pursue this, lest I should too much faulter in the Laws of Dedication; which oblige me
 to admire and praise that Apostoli∣cal Care, Prudence, Candor, and Severity, which are Eminent in your Lordship's Government; and which I dare scarce name, for fear I should offend that Heroick Modesty and Lowliness so conspicuous in your Great Conduct. Besides, I am so averse to the usual Modes of De∣dication, that I cannot comply with them in any thing, unless in my hear∣ty Prayers for your Lordship's Good Health, and Long Life; and in te∣stifying to the World that I am,
MY LORD,
