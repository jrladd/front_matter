SIR,
'TIs not enough for Men to know that Sentence of Scripture, With the heart man believeth unto Righ∣teousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto Salvation, Rom. 10.10. But they must endeavour also to reduce it to Practice. The heart is the center of Faith, but Faith must not be confined within it, it ought to break out and spread abroad, specially in time of Trial; true Faith, like the Palm-Tree, grows under the weight; the Mouth must never disown the Heart, but it must speak what the other feels, and according to ones abilities assert Di∣vinity in all the Parts thereof, whither Didactical for Dogmes and Doctrines practical for Life and Conversation, or
Polemical for Controversies; for one is not only to know, but also to live ac∣cording to his Faith and Knowledge, and defend it against Cavils and Objections.
The Consideration of this duty in∣cumbent upon every Christian, put me upon compiling these few Sheets which now are here published, and which upon several accounts are due, and ought to be dedicated to You, for they had their Conception in Your House, and at seve∣ral times, and upon many occasions, the Author hath been made so sensible of your Love and Kindness, that he lies under an Obligation to declare it to the World. Your generous Spirit hath ex∣tended it self upon several Objects, but none of them ever entertained thoughts of a higher and more real Respect for You than doth
Sir,
