Mistris,
I Am almost as great a stranger to you, as Abrahams servant was to faire Rebekah: yet hearing of your love and lenity to stran∣gers, I have made bold for to Present, and humbly Dedicate this poore E∣pitomy, and little Manuell of my few dayes labour to your worthy view; hoping you will accept and entertaine it as willingly, as courteous Joseph did his Brother Benjamin, or good Elijah the widow of Zarephaths lit∣tle Cruse of Water: in doing which, I shall think my self as really happy as Hester was in the kind aspect, and gracious countenance of Ahasuerus. Now the God of Abraham,
 Isaac and Jacob protect, preserve, and keepe you, and send those gifts, and heavenly graces you retaine, may be as faithfull to you as Jo∣nathan to David, and keep you still as con∣stant company, as Ruth did Naomi; and those that are not truely so indeed, may doe as Noah's Dove did, being once put forth, never returne againe. So prayes, and ever shall,
