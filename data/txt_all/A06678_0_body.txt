WHen Caesar swaid the dictatorship of Rome, those (right Honorable) that wrote the Romain conquests, offred their papers under his patronage as coveting a martiall Mecoenas, for works treating of high performed chivalrie: Entring into the sight of the Romain methode, chauncing up∣on a Spanish Pamphlet, dedicated to the Queenes most ex∣cellent Majestie, containing an answer against certaine un∣truths published and printed in Spaine: when I noted that vertue coulde not but be praised, even by a late enimie, (though now reconciled) a stranger, naie a Spaniard, force∣ced by truth it selfe, to defend the woorthines of our En∣glish Nobilitie, against his owne countriemen: I could not (right Honorable) but (for the benefite and farther incou∣ragement of my country) publish his works in English, and presume to present it to your good Lordship; who, being (most woorthilie) high Admirall of England, and cheefe agent, in so honorable a service, did blazon to the Spani∣ards the matchlesse resolution, of your knightly prowesse. And although Sir Francis Drake be most touched in their invectives, as an enimie cheefely noted for his private pre∣judice, offered them in Spaine, and in the Indies (and as they thought) the cheefe governor also in this honorable action; Yet now feeling and knowing the valor of your ho∣nors woorthines; time shal make your name as fearefull to the Spaniards, as was that of high minded Scipio against the Numidians. And somewhat (by comparison) to note (right

Honorable) the slacknes of Englishmen, in yeelding high deservers, (in so honorable and profitable a service) their due: I saie, that if the Duke of Medina, (being in the same place for Spaine, as your Honor for England) had gotten (as God forbid) the like glorious conquest against our English Navie, as your Honor woone against the Spanish Armada; the chronicles of Spaine had bin stuffed with his praises, the cleargie had soong him in, with Te Deum, tho∣row the streets of Toledo, made him triumphs in his towne of S. Lucar, and in fine Deified him, and registred him a∣midst their catologue of Saints. If then (right Honorable) the Spaniards setting out such hyperbolicall trophees of their cōquests, seeke by such praises to incourage their no∣bilitie: It behooveth us, not to be stained with ingratitude, but to publish the prowesse of such woorthy men as still with their bloud do paint out, the woorthines of their re∣solutions. Amongst whom your Honor having the cheefest place, as high Admirall of so victorious a fleete, and perfor∣ming in your owne person such honorable service therein: I humbly present this my simple translation to your Ho∣nors patronage, as the Romaines did their martial discour∣ses, to the Dictator, hoping your Honor will beare with the harshnes of my stile, in that verbally it answers the au∣thors minde, and to accept of my well intended meaning, with that honorable curtesie, that your noble minde hath alwaies extended towards others: In which hope resting, I wish to your lordship, such health and happines, with such most honorable successe to all your at∣tempts, as your Honor can desire, and I imagine.
