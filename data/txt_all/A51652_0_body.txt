MOst Reverend and Gracious Fa∣ther in God: Notwithstanding that in a Publick Audience, I have renounced the Church of Rome and her Doctrine, and declared my self most willing to imbrace all and every Article of the Church of England, be∣cause I could not at that time so fully open and lay down the Motives and Grounds of my Conversion as I intended, I promised to explain my self more am∣ply,

not only to that Audience, but also unto the whole World, by putting my Motives forth in Print. Having there∣fore in some sort discharged my Promise, by collecting, though not all, yet the chief∣est of my Motives, and fore-seeing not only what sharp Censures, but also what great Opposition these my poor Endea∣vours must sustain, and considering that a weak Body hath need of a strong sup∣port, presuming upon your Grace's favour, I thought it most convenient to dedicate these my first Fruits unto the High-Priest: Not only to the end that this small Treatise might with more security present it self both to Foes and Friends under your Grace's Protection, but also that the oblation of this small Mite might satisfie for some part of the great Obliga∣tion and Duty I owe unto your Grace, and moreover be a Testimony of my most

humble Affection and dearest Respect. Thus most humbly desiring your Grace's gracious and favourable Countenance, and beseeching the Lord of Heaven long to protect and preserve your Grace in all Health and Happiness, to his Ho∣nour and the Comfort of his Church,
