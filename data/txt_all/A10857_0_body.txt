AS there is not any thing in this world more acceptable vnto God, (most gracious Soueraigne) then a contrite heart: so I presume that there is not any thing in this world (next to the loue of God) more ac∣ceptable vnto your Majestie, then a true and loyall subject. Thus vsing this perswa∣sion, for a sure argument of your Majesties gracious acceptance, I presume to mani∣fest my selfe, a most true and loyall sub∣ject vnto your Majestie. In token where∣of, I haue gathered the chiefe of my treasurie, the which in most humble and obedient manner, I present vnto your Highnesse: beseeching your High∣nesse not to mislike your subject, for the subject, sith it is for the good of all your Majesties louing subjects. The Art is deuine, the Jnstrument laudable, my Meaning good, my Skill drownde in the depth of Catoes wordes (who saith) Nec te collaudes, nec te culpaueris ipse. And yet I can say for my selfe, that once I was thought (in Denmarke at Elsanure) the fittest to instruct your Ma∣jesties Queene, our most gracious Ladie and Mistres.
Thus prostrating my selfe at your Majesties feet, incessantlie crauing pardon for my bold attempt, I rest. Restles in praier, for your Graces wel∣fare, both now and euer.
