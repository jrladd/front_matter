O Friends! In the perfect Love of God Almighty towards your Souls and Bodies, and towards all Mankind; which Love is as a Fountain opened in my heart, & kindly issueth forth in Soul-breathing-desires of good, unto the whole Creation. In this Love (joined with an humble, meek and lowly temper of spirit) do I present this little quantity of substance unto you; not so much for your approof of my Work, as if I craved your License and Approbation for this small Piece to pass under your justificati∣on, (as is usually the manner of such Epistles thus directed;) but much more, for your serious and weighty considerations of the Cases (though briefly, yet truly) unfolded, which are things of very great moment to you; and wherein All of you, from the least to the greatest, are less or more concerned: And I do present this Work unto you as wholesome Advice, and good Counsel for you, (which ye ought ve∣rily to read and receive as such) rather then to flatter you by begging a Passe-port from you, that this may be read and received where it shall come; for the truth and verity of it, the weight of the matter contained, and the soundness of substance demonstrated, shall plead its own worth for acceptation in the Hearts and Consciences of all sincere men. The Truth and Verity, Weight and Substance of
 Matter: I say, These Terms I may justly present this small Piece under the denomination of, unto you, and all the world. True it is, I do not study pleasing Stile, nor have I endeavoured to clothe and trim the Matter with flattery, curious tearms, words of man's wisdom, or some rare Method, that it might appear more in shew, than in real substance, (as the way of too many Writers hath been in such cases;) nor do I promise to please the Worldly Wisdom in men, by a delightful sound, so much as to answer the sincere Conscien∣ces of men by sound Truths, declared more in homely, broken tearms of speech, than in the rarity of Phrase, or well-compact∣ed Rhetorick; For I have always desired to be known and approved of God, and those that fear him, in sincerity, humility, and down∣right truth; and for this I study daily, and labour always, even to have praise, peace and comfort of God, rather than men, in what I am, and in what I do; and therefore 'tis my desire that ye would look beyond the Method containing, to the Matter contained, and that your eye may be onely fixed on the Substance intended, which is verily, and in truth, That ye may be informed the way of your peace and happiness in this world, and in that which is to come; and may never hereafter impose by force and violence in the matters of Faith, and the Wor∣ship of God, upon the Consciences of any, through penalties and punishments upon mens Persons and Estates, but that ye may allow and tollerate freely, Liberty of Conscience in all Religious Mat∣ters, and may not by cruelty destroy men in their Persons or Estates, upon the account of their being supposed to be, or if really Hereticks, and because of difference in Judgement and Practice, in Spiritual Matters.
These are the particulars (for substance) held forth unto you, and all the world; and I have judged it most proper to direct these Ca∣ses to your view and consideration, as being the persons most chief∣ly (though not wholly) concerned: therefore blame me not, but ra∣ther receive my Love, though but little in quantity, yet real in quality, and that ye will find one day, when ye have truly tried the effects of the two Cases plainly laid before you, which are, Impositi∣on upon Conscience, and, Free Liberty of Conscience; These are the two Causes which will have their contrary and different effects upon all the Rulers in the world; Peace, Blessings, Prosperi∣ty and Happiness, are the effects of the one Cause; and Wars, Tribu∣lations,
 Contentions, Misery, Sorrow and the Curse, are the ef∣fects which have, and will unavoidably follow the other Cause; and this ye will all find in the experience of Time and Transactions, com∣ing to pass in the world: And therefore I cannot but (in homely, plain words, as my manner is) assert the Causes, and the effects of the Causes, unto you, again and again, for the very end, to inform you, advise you, and warn you to follow the Good, and to forsake the Evil, to do the right, and hate the wrong, that the effects of Righ∣teousness, and Liberty of Conscience, even Peace, Love, Mercy and Prosperity, may ever be with you; and the effects of Cruelty and Oppression, and Imposition upon Conscience, which will be your misery, downfall and destruction (if ye continue in the Cause which works this Effect) may be turned away, and ye delivered.
Wherefore O ye men, be advised, be warned; this is the day of the Lords dawnings; We have seen his Power and Glory; he hath wounded Us, and healed Us, he hath killed and made alive; he hath proclaimed Liberty in Our Souls and Consciences, from Death and Darkness, from the Grave and Hell; and he hath set his People free from bondage, to serve him with a pure and perfect heart; and if ye (mortal men, made of the dust of the ground, whose little measure of breath is in your Nostrils) will not approve of, and join with this blessed Work of the Lord, but shall gain-say his doings, and set your Power against his Power, and will not let the People go free in the exercise of their Consciences on holy performances, whose Con∣sciences God hath made free; then shall the Most High reward your op∣position with his Cup of Vengeance, and he will make you know he is the Lord against whom ye thus raise contention; and he will dissolve your substance, and bring down your glory, and subdue your pow∣er, if that (I say) ye oppose his Work, and will seek to bind and li∣mit his Spirit in his people, and wil yet force and impose upon Con∣science by outward violence, and kill, and persecute unto death, and banishment for matter of Conscience, and because of difference in Judgement in spiritual things; then thus it shall be done unto you, Ye shall fall, and perish, and be troubled, and blessings and prospe∣rity shall not be unto you. If it be not thus, the Lord hath not spoken by me.
Well Friends, even all ye that have Authority and Power in the Government of this World, are nearly concern'd to take special no∣tice of these things presented unto you, seeing the Effects of these two Causes are both very weighty, and infallibly certain, even to you-
 wards particularly: Very weighty, because Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, or Misery, Distractions and Downfall to you is depend∣ing upon the Effects of the Causes; Infallibly certain, because the Justice of God Almighty is such, that he must bring reward upon all according to their deeds, and his Justice cannot be diverted: But if ye permit free Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of godli∣nesse in Faith and Worship, unto all people under your Power, then shall Peace and Prosperity be unto you, according to the purpose of God: But if ye impose upon Conscience in any wise, by force in Religious matters, & will not be instructed and advised to the con∣trary, then shall misery and destruction certainly be unto you, accor∣ding to the Justice of God's Vengeance. These things are so, as a Ser∣vant of God I present them to you, and not upon fiction or fancy, but as I have received them from the Lord God, by his Spirit, which sig∣nifies the verity and certainty of these things in my soul.
Friends, Doubt not of these things; for verily the time is at hand, and it must surely come to pass, my Spirit shall see it, and rejoice therein, if in this body I may not behold it, That imposing and forcing of Con∣science by Laws and Ordinances of Men, upon penalties on mens Persons and Estates, in Religious matters, shall be expunged, sub∣dued and abandoned in these Nations & Kingdoms of the world, and it shall be no more: But Liberty, Liberty shall be re-planted, embraced and renowned amongst men, and Truth and Righteous∣ness, Mercy and Peace, True Liberty and Freedom, Justice and true Judgement, with all the Causes and Effects thereof shall flou∣rish, and grow, and prosper on the Earth, and the contrary shall fall, and rise no more. This Day is drawing nigh, it's at the door, blessed are they that are prepared for it: Wherefore let all flesh hear and fear, bow and tremble; and let the hearts of the Righteous re∣joice and be exceeding glad; let all the upright in heart put on the garment of Praises and Deliverance; for the Day is at hand, that Antichrist (with all his Strength and Power, Force and Policy) shall be a hissing, and reproach, and shame, and contempt unto the Saints of the Most High, and amongst whom the Lord God Omni∣potent doth, and must Reign and Rule in Dominion, and Glory, and Power, over All, for ever, and evermore.
