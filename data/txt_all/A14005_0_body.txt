Right Honourable,
THere is no sound
reason, why any
man should glo∣rie
in himselfe
being Alone,
and I thinke,
no man, that is
compos animi, doth desire it, see∣ing
no man can be compleat and hap∣pie,
no not in this world, without a
Fellow. It is no mans vnitie in

himselfe, but his Vnion and Com∣munion
witb others, that makes him
blessed. Woe therefore vnto him,
that is alone.
But amongst all our Vnions one
with another there is none to be com∣pared
with our Coniunction with
our blessed Lord and Sauiour, Iesus
Christ. For Princes, Parents, Pa∣trones,
Husbands, Wiues, Children,
Kinsfolkes, Friends, Neighbours, and
all others also, with whom wee are
conioyned, are but the spoyle of Time,
and a prey for Death. Adam and all
his Children are but Eatrh. Some of
them indeede stand aboue their Bre∣thren
like Mountaines: yet these
Mountaines (as well as Mole-hills)
are but earth: and earth will to earth,
though all the world say nay. But our
Lord Iesus Christ hath mastered the
graue in the graue, and ouercome
death in death: hee is aliue and liues

for euer. And whereas no other V∣nion,
no not all the Vnions in the
world together, can assure the soule
of Gods fatherly grace, and giue it a
true Title to euerlasting life; this
can, and doth, in so much that hee,
which is ioyned to Christ, may say,
and say truely with Saint PAVL,
I am dead to the Law,Gal. 2. 19. I am cruci∣fied
with Christ: but I liue: yet
not I any more, but Christ liueth in
mee. And in that I now liue in the
flesh, I liue by the faith of the
Sonne of God, who hath loued
me, and giuen himselfe for mee.
A happie man indeede; clothed with
Christ, partaker of his merits, in∣dued
with his Spirit, and transform∣ed
into him by his grace. This man
cannot perish out of doubt, but Christ,
who died for him, and liueth in him,
must also perish with him. which can∣not
be. There is good reason there∣fore

to iudge an vnfeigned Christian
the Only blessed man indeede, and to
make more account of this Coniun∣ction
then of all earthly things, how
glorious, how great, or how good
soeuer.
A Discourse hereof I doe here
offer vnto your Honourable Lord∣shippe:
and it comes cheerefully to
you, as being bold vpon your generous
spirit and loue to learning; though in
it selfe it be vnworthy of so learned
and iudicious a Person, and comes, it
may be, also out of season; your Lord∣shippe
being full of great and weighty
businesses. But yet I beseech you grace
it with your kinde acceptance, and
vouchsafe to pardon my boldnesse
with your Lordshippe. Go on, right
noble Lord, go on. As you doe inioy
your Fathers Honours, so continue,
as you haue begunne, to expresse his
noble Vertues, that while you liue,

not onely your owne Friends and Fol∣lowers,
but that many a poore Priest,
that hath waited long at Altar, and
done faithfull seruice in the Church,
a prentishippe, or perhaps two or three,
and could neuer come by Benefice, ei∣ther
for want of friends, or through
the cruell and cursed corruption of
sacrilegious Patrones: and not such
onely, but that all, which loue
learning, godlinesse, truth and e∣quitie,
may loue you, and honour
you, and blesse God for you: and
that when you shall depart from
hence, you may inioy his Happinesse
in heauen, and leaue as honoura∣ble
a Name behinde you here on
earth.
The great God of Heauen and
Earth double his graces in you, and
grant you health and long life for
the good of this Church and State,
and the comfort of all those, that

loue your Person, and honour your
Vertues.
