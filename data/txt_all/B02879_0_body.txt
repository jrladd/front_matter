May it please your Lordship,
SOme Aristopha∣nes, removing the controversy of the Midle-state of Soules out of the Schools, and improvid ently thrust∣ing it (in English) into
the hands of Ladies, whose curiosity is not alwayes proportioned to their capacity, hath been instrumentall of great Scandall. Hence upon intreaty of such, who may command, I interposed, endeavour∣ing to clear the state of the Question, as I thought, without vio∣lence, it might import; this occasioned a reci∣procation of Epistles, wherein I would gladly
prevent all misunder∣standings, as also in the Synopsis of our Tenets, which I formerly gave in such matters, which were esteemed proper for the times.
The Result I present to your Lordships most judicious view, also to your noble Patronage. If it conduce to any good, I shall be sure of the guerdon I hope for. Your Lordships heredi∣tary goodnesse will par∣don
my boldnesse, en∣couraged by your known Vertue, and great love of Truth, who ambi∣tiously subscribe, what by many titles, my duty obligeth me to be,
My Lord,
