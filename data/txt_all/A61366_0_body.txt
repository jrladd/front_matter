MY LORD,
IT was the constant Custome in all Ages, that Subjects of this High Nature, namely History and Anti∣quity, wherein are preserved and rescued from Time the Acts and Reliques of Great Persons, should be Dedicated to the Great, and not submitted to any ordinary Prote∣ction. This Consideration of it self might have carried me in the Publication of these my Labours, to make this

Humble Address to Your Lordship, whose Eminent Ver∣tues, though they may be more Illustrious in that High Sphere wherein You are worthily placed, yet were they ever highly conspicuous, and You have been long since in the eye of the World what You are now in the Court of Honour. Let this Work therefore in all Humility be De∣dicated to Your Lordship, and if my Endeavours have been any thing answerable to the Dignity of the Matter I have undertaken; if the Antiquities of this Nation be there∣by more illustrated, the History cleared, and the Methods of former Writers rectified and amended, that is, if the Work in general be found useful and sound, and with its Novelty in some points carries truth along with it, I shall esteem it my chiefest glory that I have laid it at Your Lordships feet, entreating favour for those things only, which Your Lordship, out of Your Great Judgment and Goodness shall think some waies commendable; But if from my great Labour and Industry I promise to my self more than possibly will be allowed me, however the Work it self may serve to stand as a Testimony and Mo∣nument of that Publick Spirit eminent in Your Lord∣ship, whereby at its first appearance in the World You readily encouraged so promising an Undertaking, which if well managed (as I hope in some measure it hath been) would undoubtedly be to the honour and benefit of Your Country. May God Almighty long preserve Your Lord∣ship in that high Station in which You act, to the Honour of His MAJESTY, the Good of this Nation, and the desires of all Honest men. So prayeth,
My Lord,
