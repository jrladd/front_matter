May it please your Grace,
I Know what I ought to expect from this Presumption, but the assu∣rance I had of your Graces Goodness to forgive me, made me suffer my In∣clinations to get the better of me, and beseech your Protection for this poor Play, that has but little else to recom∣mend it to the World, the satisfaction I had to see the little Success it unde∣servedly met with from the Town, gave me not so great pleasure as I

have to see your Graces Name fix'd to the Dedication; not that I Pride my Self upon any imaginary Desert; but the occasion it gives me of doing the Duty of an Englishman, from whom all that's due to the Preserver of his Coun∣try, shou'd be paid to your Grace; this, I confess, ought to be my Task, I own my Obligation, tho' I cannot pay it, nor am I much concern'd at it, since a bet∣ter Pen than mine will find it a Duty too difficult to be Just in; and the ge∣nerality of Mankind, I'm sure, will think me in the right, not to prophane your Noble Character, by endeavour∣ing to describe it, which wou'd betray my Ignorance, more than the Publish∣ing this piece of Folly will do, which cost me more Time (and Trouble) to get Acted, than did to Write it ex∣cept one Act of it, which I wrote three Years ago,) As for its Faults, one of them is, I hear, that it is Obscene, I'm sorry it shou'd appear so, I'm sure I ne∣ver design'd it, and I believe it will

be hard to find a Comedy with less in it; those that have the clearest Reputa∣tion, have more Reason to blush for that Sin, than this has; I own there's a scarcity of that which some call Wit, and what many Authors in this Age run mad after, endeavouring to pro∣duce it out of every bodys Mouth, whether it belongs to their Character or no, still losing the Man to goe out of the way for a Jest; 'tis what I shall never labour for, (either in Writing, if I were capable, or Acting;) for he that will make Nature his Study, will find more Charms in it, and a more certain way to Applause, than can be pro∣duc'd from any abortive Conceit, which at best, can but repay him with a loud Laughter from the Multitude, who shou'd be pleas'd, I own, but not at the expence of the Author, or the Actors Reputation, nor the Displea∣sure of the Judicious, who I hope will not condemn this Play from the appear∣ance it had upon the Stage, where it suf∣fer'd

in the Acting. By the Industrious Care of whom, was so visible to the Audience, I shall spare any further Re∣flexion at this time, which could chiefly be spent in begging your Grace's Par∣don, for presuming so unworthily to write my self,
