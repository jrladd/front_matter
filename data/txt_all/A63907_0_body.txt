My Lord,
THis little Performance, which would have courted you for a Patron had you still continued at the Bar, one of the best Advocates that ever pleaded there, now dreads and fears you sit∣ting upon the Bench, where you have approv∣ed your self, by the extorted confession of your Enemies themselves, to be so just, and so im∣partial a Judge. But, my Lord, I know the
 obligingness and goodness of your Nature to be such, that you can pardon, what you will not defend, and therefore I could not forbear taking this first occasion, after having recei∣ved so great a mark of your Favour, to lay my self humbly at your Lordships feet, to pay my hearty and affectionate Acknowledg∣ments for the great Obligation and Honour you have done me. It was an Obligation of the highest nature, because I wanted a subsi∣stence so much, and was in danger every day of encountring with greater difficulties than before: And it was an Honour so extraor∣dinary, that nothing could be more; that your self, and those other Lords and Gentlemen in Commission with you, should give me so desira∣ble a Character, and so good a Preferment together; for it is plain, it was for my Loy∣alty and Affection to my Prince and Country, two Interests that are inseparable from each other, that I was made the Object of your Choice, and therefore it would be very incon∣gruous
 in me, if having withstood the shock of the most miserable Circumstances, in a firm adherence to my Allegiance and Duty, I should not now continue to the end, a perpetual Ex∣ample of the most constant and entire Obedi∣ence, when Interest, Gratitude, and Inclination are in a triple League and Confederacy to∣gether.
I owed my Fellowship at Christ-Col∣lege, to the Kings Royal Prerogative and Princely Favour, and it is to the same Roy∣al Goodness, reflected from those that act in Commission from it, that I am now proud and safe in the Title and Advantage of Hospi∣taller of St. Thomas; so that the King hath now a double Title to my Studies and my Life, beside that of my being his natural Subject and Servant, and it is still a further Obli∣gation upon me to conform to all the Instan∣ces of Loyalty and Obedience, that I may not disappoint your Lordship and the rest of the Commissioners, who have reposed a confidence and expectation in me.

 The Subject here treated of, the Omnipre∣sence of God, is of that universal influence up∣on all the Actions and Affairs of Humane Life, that if it were but duly and frequently attended to, there would be no need of the Pulpit or the Bar, and though there may be defects in the management and method, yet it happens very luckily in my discourse upon it, which was uttered when I did not think of that good Fortune which has since befallen me, that it will appear you have preferred a Pro∣testant Divine, at a time when every thing but a Protestant Dissenter, that is, a Dissen∣ter from the Established Protestant Religion, is by some branded with the Character of a Papist.
But, my Lord, you are wanted at West∣minster-Hall, and I do rudely to detain your Lordship thus long, therefore I shall conclude with my Prayers to Almighty God, whose Providence, in so necessary a Juncture, hath placed a person of so much Prudence,
 Learning, Integrity, and Courage, in so high a Station, that he would assist and guide you by his wise and good Spirit in your great and difficult Affairs, and that you may go on with continuance and increase of Honour, to be eminently serviceable and useful to your Coun∣try, till you arrive, after a peaceful and vi∣gorous Old Age, at those blest Mansions of Eternal light, and rest, and peace, which God hath prepared, as an encouragement and re∣ward of Virtue, for all those that Fear him, and Honour the King. I am, may it please Your Lordship,
