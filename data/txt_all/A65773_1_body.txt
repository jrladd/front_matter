Learned, and by me ever to
be honour'd Cosen!
TIs so long since the former Address
to you was written, that no won∣der
it should now be asham'd to
come abroad without some ex∣cuse
to justify the slowness of its
pace; which is no other, then a simple pro∣test,
that it has not stuck in my hands for at
least a whol yeer and an half. Upon these
few words I could sit down and confidently
promise my self your pardon; But emer∣gent
imputations force me to a larger Apo∣logy:
The expedition in some other late
Works of mine rendring the seeming neglect
of this more obnoxious to exception; as
if I were rather ambitious to display the
errors of some of our own side, then the en∣ormities
of professed Enemies; and your self
are conceiv'd to have a part in this suspi∣tion.

Now, since, from that long and constant
commerce you have stil maintain'd with
true Vertue & Learning, I cannot but expect
a great rationality and amplitude in your
Soul, even to bear with the defectuousnes of
others, as far as you see they govern them∣selvs
by that measure of understanding
which God affords them, I find my self ob∣lig'd
to give you the best account I can of
my proceedings, which I doubt not wil
prove so much an easier task, as you, with
whom I am to deal, are of a higher strain,
then our trivial discoursers; for, as I think,
those who set up their rest, that there is no
science to be attain'd by study, are pardo∣nable,
if they chuse opinions by pretence of
devotion or reality of interest: So I give my
cause for lost, if they be my Judges. But I
hope the great fire of truth, which first kin∣dled
in my young breast a glowing of it, and
an earnestnes of seeking it in St. Thomas his
way, has not been by length of time as much
quench'd in you, as quickn'd in me; and ther∣fore
with a ful confidence I represent my
Case to you, not doubting but the evidence
I produce wil justifie, if not the action it
self, at least the necessity I have to act as long
as the present perswasion is not forc'd from
me.
To come then to my Plea; If St. Peter com∣mands

us to be ready to give satisfaction to all
that shall ask it, concerning the hope that is in
us, by which is meant our belief, the basis
and firm support of our hope; If the design
of all that meddle with this sort of study
should chiefly aim to shew, that the doctrins
of Christianity are conformable to reason,
and such as a prudent Person, though also
learned, may imbrace, without prejudice ei∣ther
to his discretion, or knowledge: If the
suggesting to our first parents, that God
sought to govern them like fools, without
the least discernment betwixt good or evil,
be the greatest and unworthiest calumny Sa∣tan
himself could invent to charge upon the
Almighty: If it be the basest condition that
can befal a rational Essence, and the most
contrary both to God and man, whose na∣tures
consist in knowing and reasoning;
what can I conclude, but that such Teachers,
as, for ignorance or interest, obstinately re∣solve
(in treating with those who are out
of the Church) to maintain opinions, wher∣of
no account can be made, either out of An∣tiquity
or Reason, are unworthy the functi∣on
they profess, and highly obstructive to
the progress of the Catholik faith?
You, who have looked into the large Vo∣lumes
of Controvertists on both sides, cannot
but know they are petty questions, and the

impugnances of private opinions, that swel
those vast Tomes into such an unweldy and
intolerable bulk; I'm sure not only I, but
divers of my friends have had experience,
that those very opinions (for opposing
which, I am exclaimd against) have been the
retardment of the most ingenious and dis∣interessed
party of Protestants; and that o∣thers,
who were become Catholiks, out of a
pure necessity which they saw of submitting
themselvs to some unerring authority, when
they heard their faith declar'd in a rational
way, found themselvs eased, as it were, of
chains and imprisonment, and translated
into a natural state and liberty. I need not
press, how ulcers in our vitals, are more dan∣gerous
then in our outward members; and
that we cannot convince others, whilst our
selvs are ignorant in the Points we pretend
to teach them. No wise Captain searches the
Hospitals for Perdues & Forcers of breaches.
It is a great step towards the reducing others
to reason, if first we make our own thoughts
rational. This is my endeavour, this is my
fault, for which I am so deeply censur'd, even
by Catholiks.
As for Persons, my writings neither name
nor touch any: and those who make them∣selvs
pointed at by their forward boasts of
defending the opinions I dispute against, ei∣ther

understand not me or themselvs: for, did
it deserve the pains, I would undertake to
shew out of their printed Writers, that they
doe not, with any universality, maintain
those tenets I contradict. If in this present
Treatise I have in one place descended to
more particulars then my course and nature
incline me to, I appeal to your own Judg∣ment,
whether I do more then follow my
Adversary, by replying upon his very
words; and therfore your commands ought
to be my excuse.
But some think, at least this conjuncture
improper to begin this Work, & I wish they
could give me a good cause of delay; they
should finde me very ready to accept it; But
I know no time in which destructive Errors
should live unconfuted; our great Master
securing us by his example, neque ad horam
cessimus; nor can your self be ignorant with
what fury and violence the opposite opinion
strives at this very day to possess the Chruch
of God, and break the eternal Rule of Chri∣stian
faith. Wherfore, though conscious of
my own weaknes, and that, unless God ex∣traordinarily
shews his power, my endea∣vours
wil take no place, yet propter Sion non
tacebo, & propter Hierusalem non quiescam.
