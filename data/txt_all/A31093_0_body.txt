My Lord,
I Had not ventured to expose this Discourse
in the way I now do, but for your Lord∣ships
Encouragement of it; and, under
such Patronage, I shall have the less Ap∣prehensions
of those People, who may find
themselves too much concerned in the Case, to be a∣ny
thing pleased with a Subject of this nature: How∣ever
it may affect them, I have still the Satisfacti∣on
of having indeavoured, as well as I could, the

Explaining and Vindicating a Text very difficult,
and liable to be turned to very ill Constructions:
And if it any way serves to confirm the Friends of
our Church, or to rectifie those who are in lower
Degrees of Prejudice against it, it is as much as
can be hoped by
My Lord,
Your Lordships most Obedient,
Most Faithful,
and most Humble Servant,
