My Lord,
WHEN a New Book
conies into the World,
the first thing we consider, is the
Dedication; and according to the
Quality and Humour of the Pa∣tron,
we are apt to make a Iudg∣ment
of the following Subject: If
to a States-man we belive it Grav
and Politick; if a Gown-man,
Law or Divinity; if to the Young
and Gay, Love and Gallantry.
By this Ride, I believe the gentle

Reader, who finds your Lordship's
Name prefix'd before this, will
make as many various Opinions of
it, as they do Characters of your
Lordship, whose youthful Sallies,
have been the business of so much
Discourse, and which according
to the Relator's Sence or good Na∣ture,
is either aggravated or ex∣cused;
though the Womans Quarrel
to your Lordship has some more
reasonable Foundation, than that of
your own Sex; for your Lord∣sip
being Form'd with all the
Beauties and Graces of Man-kind,
all the Charms of Wit, Youth and
Sweetness of Disposition (deri∣ved
to you from an Illustrious
Race of Hero's) adapting you
to noblest Love and Softness;

they cannot but complain on
that mistaken Conduct of ours,
that so lavishly deals out
those agreeable Attractions,
Squandering away that Youth
and Time on many, which
might be more advantageously
dedicated to some one of the
Fair; and by a Liberty (which
they call) not being Discreet
enough, robb 'em of all the
Hopes of Conquest over that
Heart which they believe can
fix no where; they cannot car∣ress
you into Tameness, or if
you sometimes appear so, they
are still upon their Guard with
you; for like a Young Lyon,
you are ever apt to leap into
your Natural Wildness; the Great∣ness

of your Soul disdaining
to be conined to lazy Re∣pose;
tho the Delicacy of your
Person and Constitution so ab∣solutely
require it; your Lord∣ship
not being made for Diver∣sions
so rough and fatigueing,
as those your active Mind
would impose upon it. Your
Lordship is placed in so Glorious
a Station (the Son of so Great
a Father) as renders all you do
more perspicuous to the World,
than the Actions of common
Men already; the advantages of
your Birth have drawn all
Eyes upon you, and yet more on
those coming Greatnesses, to which
you were born; if Heaven pre∣serves
your Lordship amidst the

too vigorous Efforts, and too
dangerous Adventures, which
a too brisk Fire in your Noble
Blood, a too forward desire of
gaining Fame daily exposes you to;
and will, unless some force con∣fine
your too impatient Bravery,
shorten those Days which Hea∣ven
has surely designed for more
Glorious Actions; for according
to all the Maxims of the Iudging
Wise, the little Extravagancies
of Youth accomplish, and perfect
the Riper Years. 'Tis this that
makes indulgent Parents permit
those Sparks of Fire, that are
Gleaming in Young Hearts, to kin∣dle
into a Flame, knowing well that
the Consideration and Tempera∣ment
of a few more Years will

regulate it to that just degree,
where the noble and generous
Spirit should ix it self: And
for this we have had the Exam∣ples
of some of the greatest
Men that ever adorned Hi∣story.
My Lord, I presume to lay
t your Lordship's Feet, an Illu∣strious
Youth; the unhappy Cir∣cumstances
of whose Life ought
to be Written in lasting Characters
of all Languages, for a Presi∣dent
to succeeding Ages, of the
Misfortune of eedless Love, and
 too Early Thirst of Glory; for in
him, your Lordship will find the
fatal Effects of great Courage
without Conduct, Wit without

Discretion, and a Greatness of
Mind without the steady Vertues
of it; so that from a Prince e∣ven
ador'd by all, by an impru∣dence,
that too often attendss the
Great and Young, and from the
most exhalted Height of Glory,
mis-led by false notions of Ho∣nour,
and falser Friends, fell
the most pityed Object, that ever
was abandoned by Fortune. I
hope no One will imagine I in∣tend
this as a Parallel between
your Lordship and our mistaken
brave Vnfortunate, since your
Lordship hath an unquestioned
and hereditary Loyalty, which
nothing can deface, born from a
Father, who has given the
World so evident Proofs, that

no fear of threatned danger can
separate his useful Service, and
Duties from the Interest of his
Royal and God-like Master, which
he pursues with an undaunted For∣titude,
in disdain of Phanatical
Censures, and those that want
the Bravery to do a just Action,
for fear of future Turns of State.
And such indeed is your true Man
of Honour; and as such I doubt
not but your Lordship will ac∣quit
your self in all times, and on
all occasions.
Pardon the Liberty, my Zeal
for your Lordship has here
presumed to take, since among
all those that make Vows and
Prayers for your Lordship's

Health and Preservation, none
offers them more devoutly,
than,
My LORD,
