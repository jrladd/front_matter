HAving compiled this small Treatise, chiefly for the en∣tertainment of my selfe and private family, consisting of morall and divine princi∣ples, collected according to my severall conceptions, answerable to the distractions of these times, that neither gave me conveniency of books or liberty for con∣versation, I thought it most proper to direct the reading of these Writings more particu∣larly to your selfe then to any other: not onely in regard you are the appearing per∣son, that probably must give continuance and succession to our house, which I heartily wish may be in vertue, or not at all: but also, for

that part of the booke was written whilst my imagination was imployed in doubts and fears, concerning your late dangerous sick∣nesse, which I must confesse did not a little heighten my troubled apprehension with the consideration of all humane uncertainties, re∣solving then your losse, should have buried my principall felicities in a retired obscurity, that now for your good I am partly determi∣ned shall be further enlarged, according to conveniency and occasion: to which pur∣pose upon the same score of consideration I must conjure you to reflect often upon the extraordinary mercies of Almighty God, shewed in your behalfe, not onely in raising you unexpectedly from so hazzardable and desperate a condition of weaknesse, to a com∣petent if not a perfect degree of health and strength of body, but also that he hath been pleased to afford you many other plentifull favours, in some kinds beyond the ordinary sort of men. Wherefore as you appear by dis∣course sensible of these blessings I must advise you to carry alwaies about with you, those very thoughts you were enspired with all, (ac∣cording

to your own relation) in the greatest extremity of your sickness, as being freest from earthly passions, and those vaine ambitions, that use to corrupt the manners, if not the very understandings of most people. How∣ever I would have you believe, that I goe not about by these expressions to entangle, much∣lesse to compell you to a monasticall severity of life, but onely I endeavour by my writings and directions, to perswade and confirm you, in such a religious morality in your conver∣sation and affairs (necessary to all Christians) that may the better secure your condition both in this life and the next. And although I am confident that these generall admoni∣tions might serve for sufficient instructions to your youth, in regard I have been so wel ac∣quainted with your nature and education, yet for that I may be thought something large in my writings, concerning the extravagancies and vices of this age, I wil not let you passe in this Epistle, without some distinct advertis∣ments directed unto your selfe; however do not thinke I point personally at you in any of these particulars, onely my intention and

aimes are, by setting before your considera∣tion the inconveniencies of these passions and absurdities, you may become the more distasted with the practises of them in others; since most pittifull examples of all sorts are daily presented to your eares or eyes, especi∣ally of childrens disobedience to their pa∣rents.
Truly Will: if I should have any just occa∣sion given me, to suspect your intentionall duty or filiall love, I should have cause suffici∣ent, not onely to esteem my endeavours most unfortunate, but exceedingly to doubt of your discretion, as wel as to blame your in∣gratitude; since, as you cannot but know how much your mother and my selfe have strived in your behalfe, to the uttermost of our powers: so is it unpossible in that re∣gard, you can finde more confiding persons then our selves, whereon to place your chiefe trust and confidence, either in difficulties or inconveniencies. If at all God Almighty had not added a temporall curse, to that Commandement, and to no other, which ob∣ligeth the duty of children to their parents,

besides many other fearful testimonies, I could bring, to shew a necessity of perform∣ing with all honour and respect, those filial¦ties of nature: which I onely tell you, because many young people (as I said before) in these dayes, are grown so extravagantly preposte∣rous in their courses, that scarce is there fami∣ly, but hath some cause to complain in this nature, with more then ordinary grief; where∣as in times past children thought it not onely a reputation to their own persons, to bear a respectful honour to their parents, but even with a certain kinde of admiring duty, were most careful and diligent, to imitate their ve∣ry actions, as well as to receive their instru∣ctions.
Next I must minde you, of that danger∣ous and swelling disease of vain-glory, that useth to intoxicate in this age, so much the brains of young people, that as they become altogether void of any good nature at all, so not seldom being transported with this va∣nity, they appeare in some sort deprived of their wits; however I am perswaded that you have contracted such an experience by your

being abroad, and having conversed without flattery, that if at any time by accident you fall into the like errours, you will be soon a∣ble to put a bridle to the humour by some temper and diseretion.
But as this inclination floweth from too great an indulgency of nature, wanting a competent judgement to discern, so is it the occasion often times, not onely of unneces∣sary and distastful contentions, but also of most desperate quarrels, proceeding from dispositions too furious, which in this place, I shall example by one short story not to be questioned for the truth thereof.
Two entirely loving brothers upon occa∣sion of recreation, walking one evening with∣in the Precints of their ordinary dwelling, and beholding the skie bespotted all over with stars, one of them of a sudden wished as many fat Oxen of his own, as there appeared little lights in the Firmament; the other a∣gain, not to be behind hand with his brother as he thought in invention, also desired Pa∣storage as large as the whole Element, and then demanded how his Cattel would be fed?

the first apprehending belike indiscreetly some intention of affront to his vain▪glori∣ous conceits; in heat and choler told his brother, that they should feed in his pasture, whether he would or no: wherefore the o∣ther being also moved with passion, at this seeming intention of compulsion, hastily re∣plyed, that as by right he could not claim any interest in his Field or Medow, so was he fully resolved to debar him from all benefit and commodity therein. But in conclusion, from words they went to blowes, until at last both drawing out their weapons, which they had unfortunately about them, they soon be∣came each others murtherer, before any of the house could come to their rescue, not∣withstanding there wanted not good store of company in that noble family. Which in my opinion may be taken for a most remark∣able example of transported natures, either by vain glory or anger, especially to be pre∣vented in matters of gaming, since persons for the most part in losse, are so far from bridling their passions, that oftentimes they challenge to themselves certain priviledges to be of∣fensive,

as reflecting more upon the injurie fortune doth them, then at the equality of them that played with them, who will finde hardly temper or civility to be abused by rea∣son of such indulgent conceits, when there is no other obligation to perswade them to the supposed compliance.
The desire or itching appetite of flattery, may be said also to be a property of vaine∣glory, as well as a base effect of that lunacy, which in regard it is of a dangerous conse∣quence, especially to youth, I thinke it some∣what convenient in this place to be remem∣bred: for who are addicted thus to be de∣lighted, or rather to be laid asleepe by such enchantments, must not onely still resolve to converse with fooles and knaves, that either for ends, or out of ignorance, will be ever subject to each fantasticall humour of theirs, but for the most part they shall be kept out of all eminent company, in regard that those who have gained a powerfull influence over their weaknesse, are obliged to procure them the greatest distance may be with worth and knowledge, since indifferent people without

any partiality, would be apt to discover true or false lights. Be assured that this inclina∣tion proceeds from a kind of low disposition, though extreamly swoln up with a preposte∣rous and ignorant pride, that wants sufficient courage to gain estimation by industrie; such people at last will be forced to entertaine fearce any thing else but sloth and sensuality: which is the worst condition man possibly can fall into.
To avoid all these inconveniences, nothing is more proper, then to keepe alwaies the mind and the body imployed with some No∣ble activity; however it is not sufficient to be continually busied, but it will be found most necessary also to have some designe or period in the imagination; as well to know when to end, as what to begin; neither to be wea∣ried by difficulties, or altered through incon∣stancy, and so by consequence not to leave any prosecution, unlesse the judgement upon serious deliberation give a willing and know∣ing consent: for no doubt as the Word is most composed of craft and ignorance, so will there not want perpetually aboundance

of alluring diversions: in that people for the most part cannot well brook worth in an∣other, since they are resolved not to take the pains for it themselves, and therefore will endeavour rather to undermine reputations by detraction, then hope to equall vertues by industry. If you doe well, you must look ra∣ther to be spighted then commended; and if you doe ill, you may onely purchase some little compliance with your perdition.
Last of all, I would not have you too much either to reflect upon our past felicities, or too feelingly apprehend our present misfor∣fortunes; since both the one and the other may seem past recovery; yet as we have suffer∣ed something injuriously, though perhaps but equal with others of the same quality and prosperity, so aparantly have we beheld in all our sufferings, evident signes of Gods mer∣cies towards us, not onely in delivering us from many hazards and dangers, with a con∣venient supply alwayes when our necessities were most pressing; but also hath formed your education, out of these troubles; which I dare be bold to say (in your own thoughts)

you value more then a great deal of worldly fortune. However, it is not sufficient onely to have these conceits and opinions, but with industry and discretion, you are to make use of both what you have, and what you have not, by pitching upon some laudable settle∣ment for your future conveniencie and subsi∣stence, in which course, in despight of all ma∣lice and enticements, I would have you to be resolute, and so little ashamed of the profes∣sion and practice of Religion and Honour, that boldly you are not onely to love and cherish those vertues in your self, but publike∣ly to countenance them wheresoever you shall finde them in others, in so doing, you shall ever oblige me to rest,
