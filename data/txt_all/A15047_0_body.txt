RIght Honorable, albeit that sun∣dry
of the (Manifold) louers, of
your most worthy Nephewe, of
deare memorie, Sir Phillip Sidney
Knight, haue alreadie witnessed,
their true affections, in publishing of passionate
Poems, Epitaphs, and Commemorations of his ne∣uerdying
vertues: yet I hope, my later writing
shall finde intertaynment of your Lordship, & fa∣uour
amongst those, that truely loued him. Consi∣dering
that my slacknesse to the world, proceeded
from a diligent search, to set downe his deuine and
heroical gifts, according to truth: though vnpossi∣ble
to giue them the life & grace, which shined in
his actions. The learned Lypsius was not decei∣ued,
when in beholding of this noble Gentleman,
he aduisedly sayd.
