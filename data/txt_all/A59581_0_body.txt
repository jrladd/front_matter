SIR,
IT was not from too tender indul∣gence to mine own Conceptions, that I have given this ensuing Dis∣course this publick Birth, and endea∣voured to immortalize it by dedicating it to your Name: but taking a just mea∣sure of my Obligations by your Fa∣vours, I easily discerned, that my grate∣ful Acknowledgments ought to be as o∣pen and manifest, as They have been notoriously free and bountiful; and al∣though
by this I am so far from requi∣ting them, as I was from deserving or expecting them, yet I do hereby recog∣nize and set up for them This, as my Pillar of remembrance. Sir, I am so conscious, that my weaknesses are deri∣ved to all the issues of my studies and labours, that I fear this Address will rather enhance, than in any degree les∣sen my debts to you, because what I here present is unworthy of you, and might rather affect an everlasting Con∣cealment, than a short Animadversion from you; and therefore I must appeal to the generous tenderness of your com∣passions to sanctuary me from the seve∣rity of your Judgment; being confident, that when you consider it as the result of Duty, perform'd with Love and Thankfulness, it will not only obtain
your Pardon, but your Acceptance too. If my Present be like Jacob's to Jo∣seph, in that it is little; 'tis also like it in that 'tis the best I have; and I hear∣tily wish it were much in a little, the goodness of the Quality might compen∣sate for the scantness of the Quantity: but if the perusal of it prove to be lit∣tle pleasing and profitable, 'tis some re∣lief to me to foresee, that it cannot be much disgustful and wearisome. Tis manifest from the purport of this Ser∣mon, that He in the event will be the best man, who employeth and impro∣veth his proper Trusts and Talents to the best purposes: and if it contri∣bute any assistance towards a faithful management of your great and excel∣lent Gifts and Interests, and provoke you to improve the many fair and in∣viting
advantages you partake of, to be yet more serviceable to God and his Church, to your Prince and Country, I shall have cause to bless God, that he hath put it into my heart thus willing∣ly to offer it to your perusal and ser∣vice.
That your Honour, your Exemplarily Vir∣tuous and Honourable Lady, the many gal∣lant and flourishing Branches derived from you, and all those other Relations which de∣pend upon and serve you, may constantly first seek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteous∣ness, and be more and more blessed, especially with Spiritual and Heavenly blessings, is, and shall be the instant and incessant Prayer of him who is,
Sir,

Moreton-Hampstead Nov. 20. 1674.
