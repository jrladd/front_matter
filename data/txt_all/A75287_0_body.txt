MADAM,
I Took it as a special Providence, that in my troubles at London I got ac∣quaintance with your Honor: Your Contribution at my parting, won much upon my heart; but your fellowship and communion at our first meeting in Church-Assem∣blies, and especially at that sweet Ordinance of the Lords Supper, obliged me more, and faster to you in purer loves. I bless God for the Friends I found in my distress, but for the Communion of Saints, and for the Comforts I found in such Commu∣nion, Bless the Lord, O my soul,Psal. 103.1. and all that is within me, bless his holy Name. You may wonder, that upon so small acquaintance I should lay this Book at your feet; it is not because I wanted other Patrons, but because at that very time, when I left it with the Press, I observed God stirring you up, as a right Patron, to encourage, relieve and com∣fort
 the Composer of it. I was then (as the Lord or∣dained it) in some trouble, and you encouraged me, and relieved me; but especially you comforted me with your society at that Soul-feast, when originally I drew all my comfort out of the wells of Salvation.Isa. 12.3. I cannot but love and honor you in this last respect; for indeed I am, and I desire to be very choyce and careful with whom I joyn in that sacred Ordinance (yet am no Sectary;) and this increaseth my af∣fections to the Saints so much the more. Madam, I hope you will countenance (for I partly know, and am verily perswaded, that you are a constant practio∣ner of) all Duties, both Secret, Private and Publike: and if this weak Work, Patronized by you, may in any sort be helpful to you, or to any of the Saints, I have my desire, and shall give God the Glory.
