And the rather cosidering that in such case (as D.Conference c. 2. diuis. 2. p. 68. Raynoldes confesseth) It is not the shew but the sense of the wordes (of Scripture) that must decide controuersies; and that touching this questionable sense, the
 Scripture howsoeuer infaliible and sufficient in it selfe which none deny∣eth, yet it is not (which is the onely point now pertinent and questio∣nable) infallibly sufficient as to vs in her instruction therof, as not re∣soluing and instructing vs therein infallibly, because not immediatly of it selfe but onely by certaine meanesWhitaker de Scriptura, con∣trouer. 1. q. 5. c. 9. p. 251. on our behalfe required, asWhitaker, ib. p. 521. 522. 523.

What reason can our aduersaries allegde wherby to acknowledge the Churches priui∣ledge in the one & deny it (where it is no lesse needful) in the other?
It cannot therfore I hope (in these times of so great doubt & question) seeme either vnfitting or vnsafe, that for our owne more certaine instruction in the doctrine of the Primitiue Church, (which both par∣ties acknowledge for the true Church) we should make humble recourse vnto the receiued and re∣nowmed writinges of S. Austin (a principal member of the said church)
 who liuing so long before these our times, and being in such respect in∣different to our late since vprisen controuersies, is by our learned ad∣uersaries professedly reuerenced, as the vndoubtedSee hereafter c. 1. h. &c. best witnes since the Apostles times of Apostolicke doc∣trine.
Neither can the perswasion which is oftentimes setled and growen strong in vs by education, afford any infallible certanty to your greatest Maiesty, or your learned diuines, whereby to secure your selues from error, as might be made plaine (without al further needful di∣scourse) by example, not onely of sundry auncient Kinges andSee the Pro∣test.
