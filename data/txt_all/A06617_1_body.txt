A Lawfull vse of Armes there is,
a time of wreckfull warre,
When Countries cause dooth craue defence,
from force of forren iarre.
Els should we not our liues, our Wiues,
our Babes ne goods enioye:
From rampaunt clawe of greedie Gull,
that thirsts for our annoye.
And Prince might seeme in vaine to sway
the Sword and regall Mace:
If that hee should not curbe the rage
of foes deuoid of grace.
Let vs therefore in egall Skales,
all circumstances waye,
Why, when, where, how, & vnder whom
wee dinting Sword assaye.
And wee shall finde in sacred lore,
how warre from God aboue,
Good warrant hath, who dooth the same,
by sundrie texts approoue.
The Israelites great slaughter made,Num. 31.
of them of Mydian land:
And all the pray and spoyle was dealt
among their warlike band.
Th' Amalechits by Ioshua stoute,Exod. 17.
in warre were ouerthrowne:
And Moses this from Gods own mouthe,
made cleerely to be knowne.
Psalm. 18, & 144. King Dauid ioyed in his skill,
of warlike feates at large:
And sayeth that God taught him to fight,
and knowe a Warriours charge.
And warres were so accounted of
by God in time of yore:
Deut. 20. That Militare decrees were made,
in great aboundant store.
Yea, not so much omitted was,
as Trumpets how to frame,
Num. 10. And how to vse: when neede requird,
the force of foes to tame.
What praise for constant faith and life,
did Christ himselfe confesse
Matth. 8. To be in that Centurions hart,
who warfare did professe?
Cornelius, he that Captaine was
vnto th' Italian band:
Act. 10. And liu'd by Warres, much fauor found
at God almighties hand.
Luke. 3. Iohn Baptist bidding Souldiers liue,
contented with their wage,
Allowes their trade, so that they shew,
to no man dire outrage.
This and much more shall plaine appeare,
by Langeys stately style.
And by the reasons that haue past
his braue and lettred fyle.
With pollicie and valour eke,
he rites religious brings,
And no mans dutie leaues vntoucht,
ne other needfull things.
The Generall Chiefe his office heere,
beholds as in a Glasse:
The Marshall of the Campe his charge:
and (so from him to passe)
The Maister of th' Artillarie,
the Treasurer, the Iudge,
The Colonell, the Corporall,
that at no paines must grudge.
The Serieant Maior, Victailer,
the Maister of the watche:
The Ensigne bearer, Drumslade, Clarke,
and Shot that serue with matche.
And euery other pettie charge,
most liuely set abroach:
As they shall finde, that to this Booke
with heedfull care approache.
Both how to muster, how to martch,
and battaile how to giue:
On Horsse with Launce, on foote with Pike,
each way their foe to grieue.
How Winges to place, how Flankes to plant,
and how for to retyre:
At vantage how to sallie out,
to pay the foe his hyre.
With each appendance vnto warre,
and that so passing well,
That Langey now by doome of best,
dooth beare away the Bell.
Heere may wee learne how to enskonce,
in Barbican, or Pyle:
In Castle, Fort, or walled towne,
and how to drop a wile,
Or plant an Ambush, to surprise,
the Enmie in a snare:
And catche him in a net, ere he
bee once thereof aware.
These helps are now new brought to light
by Iuies painfull quill,
Who publisht hath in English phrase,
through entire heartie will,
And loyall zeale to Countries weale,
this rare and learned worke,
Not suffring it in forren toong,
from vs (vnknowne) to lurke.
Such painful works, such Captaines good,
such Souldiers at our neede,
As heerein are describde and taught,
God graunt this Realme may breede,
So should that venimd Vipers broode,
that gapes for Englands spoyle,
Be quickly brought to know themselues,
and easly put to foyle.
