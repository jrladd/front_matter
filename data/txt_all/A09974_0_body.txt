I Doe heere offer vp vn∣to your ver∣tue (which dooth yet make you more wor∣thy then the worth of
your most Honoura∣ble birth) these vn-Frenched Prayers, which the religious zeale of that reuerend man, Beza of Gene∣ua, hath in his priuate Exercises povvred out vnto GOD. To commend their ex∣cellencie vnto you, by my iudgement, were to commend them to little; and therefore,
let your owne iudge∣ment (as it can best) conceiue their worth; and your godly de∣uotion, in making vse of them, supplie whatsoeuer want of grace is come vnto them, by my chang∣ing theyr language, in the weight and life which your vtte∣rance shal giue them. To none could they
be addressed by mee, so fitly, both in re∣spect of your vertue (prone to affect such religious exercises) and for the respect & seruice I owe your woorthie Husband, (whose fauour to∣wardes me doth iust∣ly challenge a most grateful acknowlege∣ment;) And therfore if you will be pleased
graciously to receiue these Prayers at my hands, you shall adde to their number this one, That God (to whom they are sent) will, both heere on Earth, & in Heauen, blesse you with vn∣speakeable felicity.
