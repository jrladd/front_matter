HONORABLE LADY:
HOweuer Honour hath appeased your repinings, and as it were coosoned your Birth-right with the courtesie of England; so that it seemes a disparitie to place you the last, that are eldest in blood, and as worthy as the best: Yet would I not exempt you from my owne poore Wishes; nay I durst not deuide you from your Mother and Sisters, least I might want the full participation of that grace and Vertue, which I propo∣sed to my selfe from your fauour: Therefore I pray you giue me leaue to warme all benumming despaire with the Sunne of your Honor & acceptation; and amongst your other Vertues, let me both affright Despaire, that you will pardon my Errour, and strengthen my Hopes: that you will entertaine my good meaning, though it be but in the presenting of a Booke: For I protest, when I ran away hoodwinckt with an opinion, it would passe in the World as the deceit of Idlenesse, there was a plea∣sure in pretending your Patronage; and more then a Hope, in naming my Lady Chandos, as a Mistris of this Dedication.
