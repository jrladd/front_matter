MY LORD,
IT may seem a da∣ring and super∣fluous act to pre∣sent any draughts of Policy to so great a States∣man as your selfe, especial∣ly for me, so out of distance to yeares, experience, pra∣ctice, employment, profes∣sion, but my privilege is the subject I make choice on, a subject enriched with all

these, I know, as the Sama∣ritane said, The Well is deepe, and I have nothing to draw with, nothing if compared with the talents of deeper judgements, but my en∣gagement to your Lordship is the Universiy, our Studies wearing your Honours title and superscription, and our Savoiur hath there entitled a Tribute, where there is Image and Superscription, what I doe heere is but in the right recognition, what I doe in the next leafe is in right of Dedication and patronage, God make your Grace a Jewell to the Crowne below, and pre∣pare you a Crowne above, My Lord,
