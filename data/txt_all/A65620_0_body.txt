SIR,
THE Greatness of Your Majesties Judgment, as well as that of Your Condition, would deterr me from this Presumption, did I not think my self safe in the God-like Clemency of Your Nature, which appears so eminently, not only in Your Fatherly Care and Protection of Your Faithful Subjects, but even in Your Pardoning the Malice of Your most Inveterate Enemies.
And now, Sir, at a time when from all Parts of the Nation, Your Loyal People are contending how to express their Gratitude, both to Heaven
and You, for the Benignity of Your Reign, and the manifold Blessings they enjoy under so Excel∣lent a Prince; I hope it will not misbecome me to make Your Majesty this most Humble Oblation of my Duty, which proceeds from a Heart full of Reverence and Obedience for You, and possest with a deep sense of the Honour and good For∣tune I have to be born Your Subject.
All, Sir, I presume to present You with, are some Observations which I made in my Travels into Greece; a Country once Mistress of the Civil World, and a most Famous Nursery both of Armes and Sciences; but now a Lamentable Ex∣ample of the Instability of humane things, where∣in Your Majesties Discontented and Factious Sub∣jects, if their own late Calamities will not suffi∣ciently instruct them, may see the Miseries that other Nations are reduced to, and behold, as in a Picture, the Natural Fruits of Schism, Rebellion and Civil Discord.
When I consider the deplorable Condition of that once Glorious Nation, I cannot but adore the mercy of God to our own; who is pleased to let us enjoy such Priviledges under Your Majesty, in a State governed by Laws, and in a Church purified from Errour and Superstition.
Indeed, Sir, Nothing is wanting to compleat our Happiness, but that it would please Almighty God to continue it, in giving Your Majesty a Long and Prosperous Reign; and when it shall please him to translate You from this transitory to an Immortal Crown, to perpetuate Your Go∣vernment
in Your Royal Family, as the Prudence of our Ancestors, and the Politick Laws of this Ancient Monarchy have established it; that we may have no more Mock-Governments, nor lose our Religion and Liberty, as we lately did, under a pretence of better securing them.
As this is the desire, Sir, of all good English Men, so I humbly conceive it is proper, especially in such a Conjuncture as this, for every Man to own it; which must be my excuse at this time for approaching Your Majesty, as I do, and for ma∣king use of this occasion of expressing my self with most profound Humility
