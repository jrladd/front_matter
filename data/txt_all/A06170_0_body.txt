I Haue aduentured (most no∣ble Lady with the wrastlers of
Olympia, tho not to win, yet to worke for the Gar∣land; the iudgement
of my industry relyeth on your Ladishippe, who haue both authoritie to conuict,
and knowledge to commend. I haue chosen you Madam among many, to be the
Soueraigne and shee Mecaenas of my toyle, be∣cause I am assured, that
the great report of your learning and vertue, (wherewith as yet it hath not
pleased you to dignifie the world) must euen now be exemplified in mee, who
dare promise as much in affection, as any other can performe in perfecti∣on. 
 May it please you to looke and like of homlie Phillis in
her Country caroling, & to countenance her poore and affectionate
Sheepheard, who promi∣seth vnder the onely encouragement of so noble a Lady, to
employ all his best deseignes, life, and stu∣dies, to your good lyking.
