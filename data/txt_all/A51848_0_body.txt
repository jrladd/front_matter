May it please your Honour:
IN the Learned Ages of the
World, it hath ever been some∣what
difficult to suit Books to
the patronage of the Learned, Judi∣cious,
and Impartial; such as they
know you are, who know you. And
when such Pieces are prepared, and
ready to be sent abroad, it is not easy
to make choice of a Patron worthy
of such a Treatise. This presented

to your Lordship, worthy of a good,
hath found out the best Patron; and
like the incomparable History of
Thuas, happy in its Author and
manner of writing, and in its Pa∣tron
to whom dedicated, fails only
in the Pen that dedicates it. The
things it treateth of, express much
of your Honour's Sentiments,
Wishes, Value, and Endeavours, to
keep the Root of Christianity flou∣rishing,
that Christians may answer
their ancient Character, Vivimus, non
loquimu, magna. It savoureth of that
moderation which adorns the Chri∣stian;
it does with candor represent
things in which many now dissent,
that 'twould be happy for the Church
of Christ, if all would, on such terms,
forbear each other, bear one ano∣ther's
Infirmities, and shew that they
believe the Lord is at hand. Here I
think is rightly stated what are the

lesser, what are the weightier Things
of the Law; and here are Directi∣ons,
which (if follow'd) would
keep Peace and Love among Bre∣thren,
and perfect Holiness in the
Fear of the Lord. The Author en∣joys
that sight, which Holiness and
Peace here recommended, did lead
him, and will lead others unto. He
is , and reaps the Fruit of
those and other his Labours, which
were design'd to help others to
Happiness also. Be pleased to give
the Publisher leave to send this in∣to
the World, countenanced with
your Honour's Name and Favour,
which may induce some to read and
consider what you approve, and
the Author left (as Elijah did his
Posthumous Letter) to make the
Age wiser, i. e. holier and more
peaceable. Assured of this Favour
from your Honour, and hoping for

this Effect of the Work, the Pub∣lisher
leaves it at your Lordship's
feet; craving leave to subscribe him∣self,
My Lord,
