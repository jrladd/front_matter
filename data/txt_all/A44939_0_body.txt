THE Great, Madam, seldom want Addresses from the Multitude, to applaud and celebrate them; for Greatness draws the Crowd, as the burning Bush did Moses, to admire it. But what encourages others in their approaches to their Superiors, had prohibited mine to Your Royal Highness, and, like the Voice sent from amidst that Bush, had prescrib'd my admiration limits, and confind'd it to so due a distance, that it might not com∣mit a Rudeness, where it design'd to pay a
 Reverence. But, Madam, the obliging con∣descention of Your Excellent and truly Roy∣al Temper, which awes all Your approach∣ers only with a gentle Influence, as it en∣courag'd me to beg, so it readily procur'd me Your gracious permission to lay this humble Offering at Your feet. I have there∣fore presum'd to introduce into Your Royal Highness's Presence a Foreigner ambitious of the Honor, and one who must certainly be divertive, if his sense be not impair'd by the unskilfulness of his Interpreter.
For you will find him, Madam, so much your own resemblance, so religiously De∣vout, so sincerely Christian so verst in all the heights and transports of an exalted Pi∣ety, as well as all the excellencies of Wit and Sense, that his Conversation cannot be unpleasing.
And now, to whom but Your Royal
 Highness can he become a Suppliant? for where can a Work of the highest Devotion be so favourably receiv'd, as where the Per∣son whose Patronage it implores is the most Unimitable, as well as most Illustrious Pat∣tern of it?
It is not, Madam, because You are Daugh∣ter to the best, no less than the Greatest of Christian Monarchs, but because You are a faithful Servant to the King of Kings, that this poor piece begs your Royal Acceptance. It admires You not so much for Your ex∣ternal Pomp and Grandeur, as for the no∣bler Ornaments of Your Soul; nor takes so much notice that Your Garments are of Nee∣dle-work and Embroidery, as that You are all glorious within. For Your Piety, Madam, is eminent as Your Quality; and the Constancy of Your Presence, as well as the Religion of Your Performance, at the Devotions of our
 Church, might powerfully put to silence not only the Ignorance of foolish men, but the Ma∣lice too of the wicked and perverse: Or if they shou'd still continue their false sug∣gestions, yet the genuine Sons of the Church of England can have no apprehensions of un∣kindness from their Sovereign, who has gi∣ven His Princely Word, that He will defend and support it in its present Establishment, and whose Royal Issue are such inseparable Members of it, that all Its sufferings must affect Them. But God be prais'd the Church, thro His Majesty's goodness and favour, is as far from danger as from the dread or su∣spicion of it, and the notion it has of His benign and gracious disposition, renders it as fearless, as the addition of a Promise, as sacred and inviolable as the Laws of the Medes and Persians, makes it safe. And as 'tis the Churches first happiness to be under the Go∣ernment
 of so excellent a Prince, so 'tis its econd blessing to be own'd by Your Royal Highness, the public daily demonstrations of whose affection towards it, are so many convin∣ing arguments of its Purity and Perfection; and all must believe worthily of it, since it stands fair in the good opinion of one of the Wisest and most Religious Princesses in the world. Which favor it cannot fear to lose, till 'tis estrang'd from it self, till it forfeits that Character which His Majesty was pleas'd to give of it, and falls from its ancient Loyal∣ty, that signal Loyalty for which it has been always eminent, and which is a main part of ts Religion; that Religion which Your Royal Highness honors by Your Profession, and a∣dorns by your Practice of it, and which the world must admire, out of an ambitian to imi∣ate such a great Exemplar. But as Your Royal Highness is absolute in all points of a real
 Piety, so You excel in that of not seeking th worlds applause by Your performances, an therefore I leave all Panegyricks, and onl make it my humble petition, that You wi with Your usual sweetness and candor accep this mean present, and pardon the unworth Offerer,
