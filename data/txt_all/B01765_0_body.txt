Worthy Sir,
AS I have adventured to make use of your Name in this way, so I am per∣swaded, 'tis scarce more easie for uncharitable Minds to Blame me for it, than for your Kind∣ness, and Courtesie to excuse it,
in some Measure; And if Any should account me presumptu∣ous in so doing, I can truly tell them, That I had a very great, (and almost Irresistible) Temptation to it: For, Gentle∣men of good Repute and Judg∣ment do not seem to doubt, but I might bear the Reflecti∣ons of Ingratitude, as well as Imprudence; if, (having an op∣portunity) I should not make some publick Acknowledgment of my Obligations to your Worship, for those great Instan∣ces of your undeserved Friend∣ship, which (Blessed be God) I so happily received, in those publick Circumstances, that made me stand in need of so Good a Friend.

Accept therefore, I beseech you, Sir, this plain Piece, as a Pledge of the unfeigned Thanks that I must ever owe you.
And, Sir, I do the rather beg your Acceptance of it, because the Doctrine defended is apparently owned by the Church of England; and, partly, Because if it find (in the Main) that Honour and Favour, I shall think my self sufficiently Armed against the Censures of the Profane, Malignant World.
The Father of Mercies fol∣low you still with His Good∣ness; Granting you many Hap∣py Days here on Earth; and, when your Time is ended;
the Joys of Eternity, and the Blessedness of Them that Dye in the Lord. So praying, refteth, (Good Sir)
