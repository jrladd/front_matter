Noble Sir, the Renowne of your
Illustrious Vertues in Forraine
Nations, by exemplary Pietie at
home, hath beene so apparent
to me, though a stranger to my
Native Country, that I have presumed to pre∣sent
your Worship with his Treatise, ies∣sing
my ardent affection for the inlargement
of the Multitude of my poore Country-men,
groaning under the merciless yoake of Turkish
thraldome; and the rather my selfe having
there suffered, losse of my estate, and the mise∣ry
of 7. yeares slaverie in chaines, and in the
Gallies of Argeire, its not unknowne to your
Worship, having beene Resident in those parts,
what their sufferings are, as scoffes, threats,



blowes, chaines, hunger, nakednesse, with in∣numberable
others, and which is most deplora∣ble,
their danger of falling from the Christian
and most holy faith, of which sort. I have
knowne many who through the extremitie of
their sufferings hath renounced their Saviour,
and imbraced the Mahomitan and diabolicall
Imposture, these miseries and innumerable
others, having beene presented to my eyes,
though now by the mercy of God, happily
escaped, doe still increase my zeale for their li∣berties,
which your worship being an eminent
personage in this flourishing Kingdome, may
be a worthy instrument to accomplish; I feare
to be too presumptious in craving your wor∣ships
Patronage to this impolite discourse, and
therefore humbly beseech your Worships par∣don,
and implore the Divine Majestie to con∣serve
your person and honour, in making them
long and happie in earth, and in fine to re∣ward
you with Eternall happinesse,
