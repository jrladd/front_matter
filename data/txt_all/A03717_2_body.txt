RIGHT REVEREND,
NO motiue of this world, but a strong perswasion of that zeale which preach∣ed to the heart, fur∣nished the Church, and reformed the Country where I was borne, first sub∣mitted my seruice to your Lordships direction next vnto Gods, leading me to be trayned vp vnder your Lordship next vnto William of
Wickham: where the fauourable care that ath beene taken for the conuenient supporta∣tion of mine earthen vessell, to the end it might beare heauenly treasure, agreeth rather with the nature of a Father, then the name of a Pa∣trone: which as I haue been, and euer wil be rea∣dy to professe, so am I now, by this small pledge of my thankfulnesse, most willing to publish, though it cost me withall the publication of mine ignorance. God Almighty di∣rect and protect your Lordship.
