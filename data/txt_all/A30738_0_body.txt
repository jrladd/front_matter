SIR,
MEeting with this Book in
Manuscript, and liking
well the Contents thereof, I de∣sired
some of my Friends to give
me their opinions of it; which
they freely did, and told me that
they thought it would be a use∣ful
Treatise, not only for Sea∣men,
but also for all those that
are curious to be informed in the
Menage of Shipping, whereup∣on
I was incouraged to under∣take
the Printing of it. But
the Author neither having re∣commended
his Book by any
Dedication, nor Preface▪ I

thought my self obliged to beg
the Protection of some person
eminently skilful in these mat∣ters,
to make it the more accep∣table
to the Ingenious; and
knowing your great experience
in the subject treated of, and
how great a Patron and Encou∣rager
you are of the improve∣ment
of Navigation, I presume
to lay it at your Feet; and if you
shall please to accept it favour∣ably,
and afford it a good Cha∣racter;
I hope the benefit will
be to the Reader, as well as to
the Bookseller, who is,
SIR,

May 19
