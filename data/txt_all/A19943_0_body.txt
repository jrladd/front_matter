GReat Earle, whose high and noble minde, is higher
And nobler, then thy noble high Degree:
Whose outward shape, though it most louely bee,
Doth in faire Robes a fairer Soule attier:
Who Rich in fading Wealth, in endlesse Treasure
Of Vertue, Valour, Learning, richer art:
Whose present greatnes, men esteeme but part
Of what by line of future Hope they measure.
Thou Worthy Sonne, vnto a peerelesse MOTHER,
Thou Nephew to great SIDNEY of renowne,
Thou that deseru'st thy CORONET to crowne
With Lawrell Crowne, a Crowne excelling t'other;
I consecrate these Rimes to thy great NAME,
Which if thou like, they seeke no other fame.
