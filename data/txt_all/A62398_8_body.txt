UNto the prospect of your Wisdoms eyes,
I consecrat these silly Lines,
Not that I think them worthy of your view,
But, because in Love my thoughts are bound to you;
I do confess my Self unworthy far,
To dite in such like cases as they are;
Which, Homer, Virgil, nor the fluent Tullie,
In fitting terms could scarce express them fully:
For Francis Scot of Gillmans-cleugh,
To you I do commend,
In hopes your Worship still will be his Friend,
The Son of Iohn, the Son of Robert, call'd Truth,
Who was the Son of Iames,
The first of Gillmans-cleugh,
A valiant Gentleman, who well deserv'd renown,
He was the youngest Son to Iohn Scot of Thirlston;
The which Iohn Scot he did excell,
Being Son to David with the Tods-tail;
And David Scot, my Author let me know,
He was Son to Walter of Howpaslaw:
Sir Walter, he was Williams Son,
Of the worthy House of Buckcleugh he sprung,
The Lads in Gillmans-cleugh,
In hunting did excell;
So did their Father David,
That carried the Tods-tail,
Who had as much delight,
In hunting of that Beast,
As Iason had in Greece
To bear the Golden-fleece.
