RIght honorable, I humblye intreate
your honours vouchsafe to patro∣nise
this little booke, for in the ab∣sence
of my soueraigne, I know not
vnto whōe better to direct the same,
 vnto you my honoured Lords
whose prudent, wise, and forese∣eing
consideration, hath for these
many yeares principally assisted the
protection of Englands safetie; if
your Lord▪ shall be pleased to peruse
the lines herein contained, I hope not any word in them shall
proue offensiue, for my heart hath desired nothing more then
to manifest my loues beste wishes vnto my Lorde and King. I
humbly referre the discourse to bee censured by your wisedomes:
and yet desires (if your honours shall thinke it worthy) that it
might passe vnto the starre brighte eye of Englandes Maie∣stie,
to whom a Souldier wisheth a happie Coronation, and a

long, continued, blessed, peacefull, triumphant, and victorious Raigne,
to Gods glorie and Englands benifite, and that your honors
may be vnto his Maiestie, as late you were to
Queene Elisabeth.
