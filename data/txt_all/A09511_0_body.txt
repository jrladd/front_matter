MY LORD,
THat reuerend Regard your Honor gaue this Sermon, when it was de∣liuered you, as a message from the Highest, was but a iust Regard▪ But for your vouchsafing to per∣use, and giue the frame thereof approbation, both it and I haue therein largely tasted of your fauou∣rable Regard. Both your Regards it then had, and I now in regard of both, conceiued an hope that the publike inscribing it thus to your Lordships name, would passe, at least for a pardonable transgressi∣on, and might (peraduenture) in the noblenesse of your interpretation be accepted, (as I intend it) for an act of my dutifull regard to your Honor. Whereof how can I forbeare presumption, remem∣bring who hath said; Yee are Gods, and are all children of the most High. Your Lordship then cannot vnresemble your heauenly Father, who gently takes the meanest oblations of the poorest and lowest, being himselfe rich ouer all, and
Higher then the highest. He, the Iudge of all; The Lord Chiefe Iustice of Heauen and Earth, blesse and direct you so, as we may long en∣ioy, from him, thorough you the beames and influ∣ence of his Iustice in earth, and you, after this life iustly finisht, the bright beames of his Glorie, and that blessed Regard, and reward of his euer∣lasting Mercie in the highest Heauen; So prayes.
