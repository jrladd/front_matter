SIR,
THE ensuing Treatise, since it has lear∣ned to speak English, seems, by a pe∣culiar kind of Title, to lay a more especial Claim to your Patronage, than to any others. For though the Translator be a perfect Stranger to you, yet the Author, which he has ventur'd to translate, is well known by all to be one you are intimately acquainted with: wit∣ness your excellent Prince Arthur, wherein you have in a great measure confin'd your self to the Rules and Precepts which Aristotle and Horace, and even our Bossu, have prescrib'd to the Epick Poem.
'Tis upon this Account, Sir, that I presume to cast this Translation under your Protection; not questioning but, as the good-natur'd Critick is al∣ways the Poet's Friend; so now, vice versâ, the ge∣nerous Poet will stand the Criticks Friend, and

suffer his impartial Reflexions to appear in the English World under the Patronage of so great a Name.
I might here run out into high and just Enco∣miums upon your late extraordinary Performance; but there is no need for it, since the Work loudly speaks forth its own Praises: and I should rather seem unjust in saying too little, than be thought guilty of Flattery for saying too much in its Com∣mendation.
I have, Sir, in the Preface, ventur'd to make some few Reflexions on your Poem, and hope you have Candour enough to excuse the Freedom I have taken therein. If I have offended, or com∣mitted any Mistake, I here declare my self willing and ready to retract upon due Conviction; and shall be always forward to submit my self to the Sentence of better Judgments.
All I have more to say, is, to beg Pardon for my Presumption, in desiring to prefix your Name before my weak Performance; which Favour I hope you will grant to,
Honoured Sir,
