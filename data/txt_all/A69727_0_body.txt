YOUR Majesties Cu∣riosity to survey the Subject of this Dis∣course, the so much admired Antiquity of STONE-HENG, hath sometime been so great and urgent, as to find a room in Your Royal Breast, a∣mid'st Your weightiest Cares; and to carry You many miles out of Your way toward Safety, even at such

a time, when any Heart, but your Fearless and Invincible one, would have been wholly fill'd with appre∣hensions of Danger. For, as I have had the Honour to hear from that Oracle of Truth and Wisdom, Your Majestie's own Mouth; You were pleased to visit that Monument, and, for many hours together, entertain Your self with the delightful view thereof, when after the defeat of Your Loyal Army, at Worcester, Almighty God, in Infinite Mercy to Your three Kingdoms, miraculously de∣livered You out of the bloody Jaws of those Monsters of Sin and Cruelty, who taking Counsel onely from the Heinousness of their Crimes, sought Impunity in the highest Aggravation of

them; desperately hoping to se∣cure Rebellion by Regicide, and by destroying their Soveraign, to continue their Tyranny over their Fellow-Subjects.
This, as at first it animated Me, to make strict Enquiry into the Origine, and Occasion of the Wonder (so the Vulgar call it) so far as the gloomy darkness of Oblivion would admit; so hath it now emboldned me, to lay at Your Majesties Feet the following Account of my Success in that Enquiry: in all possible Humili∣ty and Reverence, beseeching You to Honour, with Your Gra∣cious Acceptance, the RESTORA∣TION of that Gigantick Pile, whose dead Remains You so high∣ly

Ennobled by Your Presence. Once You made it Your Diver∣tisement, to look upon it sleeping in deep Forgetfulness, and well-nigh disanimated by the Lethargy of Time (which often brings the River Lethe to flow as well above ground, as below): Dis∣dain not, therefore, now to cast an Eye upon it, when it appears to lift up its massive Head again, and offers, in plain Language, to tell You the Story of its Life, from whence it was derived, by whom it was formed, for what noble Use it was intended, and how it hath since been sacrilegiously violated. Which Story, though grounded onely on Conjecture; is neverthe∣less neither Unpleasant, nor Un∣profitable.

Having diligently compared STONE-HENG with other. Anti∣quities of the same Kind, at this day, standing in Denmark; and finding a perfect Resemblance in most, if not in all Particulars ob∣servable, on both sides; and ac∣quainting my self moreover with the Uses of those rudely-mag∣nificent Structures, for many hun∣dreds of years together: I now at length conceive it to have been Erected by the DANES, when They had this Nation in sub∣jection; and principally, if not wholly Design'd to be a Court Royal, or place for the Election and Inauguration of their Kings; according to a certain strange Cu∣stome, yet of eldest Date, most sa∣cred

Esteem, and but late Discon∣tinuance among that Martial People.
Whether, or no, my Authori∣ties and Reasonings for this New Opinion of mine, be such, as may be allowed sufficient to render it highly Probable (for, further I pretend not): as becomes me, I most humbly, most freely submit to Your Majesty's most Excellent Judgement, in which You are no less Supreme, than in Your Power; and than which, none can be either more Discerning, or more Equitable. So that if it prove so fortunate, as to receive Your Approbation, I need not fear the Censure of any Under∣standing

Reader: if not, I shall however gain this advantage, to have my Mistake rectifi'd by a King, whose Reasons are Demon∣strations, whose Enquiries are the best Directions unto Truth, whose Assent always is a sign of Truth, and to whose other Regal Prerogatives an admirable Wis∣dom hath superadded this, that He is less subject to be imposed up∣on, than any other Man!
In the meantime, and ever, ac∣cording to my Duty, I shall ear∣nestly pray to Almighty God, that He would be pleased to en∣rich Your Sacred Majesty, with all Blessings answerable to the Largeness of Your Mind, to the Sublimity of Your Condition, to

the VVeight of Your Charge, to the Multitude of Your Virtues, and to the Hopes and Wishes of all Your Good Subjects.
April the 27th 1662.
