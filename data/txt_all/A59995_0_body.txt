SIR,
AT this time, the Press doth almost groan with the burden of new Grammars, by which, some would prophetically imply the decay of Learning, as if the Root and Founda∣tion of Art stood in need of warmth, and reparation: If I were guilty of his belief, I am not so old in practice, o forget how much unworthy I am, o apply to such publike necessity. It
 shall be happiness enough to me, if while your yeers are fit for principles of this nature, this Book be not thought unworthy of your shade and protection.
I dare not be so bold to prescribe it to your particular use, others having more worthily the honor to be em∣ployed in your Education; but if with their judgment, it may be admitted to your reading, I am very confident, it will much facilitate your progress, and make the way short and pleasant, if you walk by Rules to the Latine tongue.
It remains, that I wish you may grow up the great example of true Nobility: You cannot but raise our expectation, while you are remem¦bred, the Son of your most nobly ac¦complished Father, descended from your yet flourishing Grand-father
 whose name is worthily affixed a Patron to more generous wit, then our Nation must hope to see again in all future Ages.
Nor can the glory of your great Uncle, William Earl of Pembroke (the ornament of the Court and Kingdom) and the ever celebrated name of Sydney, whose blood is warm in your veins, be out of your eye and imitation: Their fames I look upon as an immortal trea∣sury, left by them, who had merited for more then themselves, and might from their supernumerary vertues, spare enough to indulge posterity.
But let their Characters be the Argu∣ment of a more able Pen, I return to my first ambition, that these Papers dedicate to your name, may ow their first light, and life to the influence of your morning, so the world shall read
 to the happy presage of your great name, that you disdained not to begin to learn, and to be a Mecenas together; while I (encouraged by your vertue, o lay this first publike sacrifice upon your virgin Altar) am but the more engaged to profess my self,
Sir,
