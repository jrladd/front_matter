'Tis under your Protection therefore that they venture abroad, and 'tis from your Approbation that they hope to meet with a kind Recep∣tion: For Musick can never be better Recommended, than by your Judgment, unless you please to add your excellent Perform∣ance. But 'tis neither our Talent, nor Design to aim at Comple∣ments, our only Meaning is, to Honour this Specimen with your Name; and 'tis upon that Presumption that we hope to meet with either Encouragement, or at least Excuse from the rest of the World, if we are but so happy as to have it from You.
SIR,
