My Lord,
THis Book hardly containes any thing, but a confused heape of my first Caprices, or, rather the first follies of my youth; I con∣fesse 'tis with some shame, that I owne it, now in my more advanced yeares: Never∣thelesse my Lord, I dedicate it to your Lord∣ship with all 'its defects, and beseech you to let it travail the world under your glorious protection. What will your Lordship think of so strange a proceeding, you'le be∣leeve perhaps, that 'tis want of respect, to dedicate to you, that which I my selfe con∣temne; and prefixe your Illustrious Name in the front of a worke, where I blush to see my own: I hope neverthelesse (my Lord) that my respect and my zeale, are so well

knowne to you, that you will not impute the liberty I take, to a cause that will be so disadvantageous to me. Its now almost a twelve moneth since I gave my selfe to you, and since that happy moment (esteeming all the time of my life lost that was not im∣plyed in your service) and not being satis∣fied, with having devoted to you that which remaines, I have endeavored to re∣paire that losse, by consecrating likewise to you my beginnings; And because that which is passed cannot be recovered to pre∣sent you with, I offer to you at least all that is left me of it; and by that meanes (since I have not had the honour to be yours all my life,) my life hath in some sort been imployed for you. Besides (my Lord) you know that of all the Offerings that were made to God under the old law, none were so acceptable as the first fruits, however they are not usually the best. And (if it may be permitted to add that which is prophane after a thing so holy) you are not ignorant neither that the Athenians thought they could not make a more plea∣sing and agreeable present to Apollo then by sending to his Temple at Delphos their first hair, (which they consecrated to him) as the first production of their braine. This makes

me hope (my Lord) that youle not refuse the offering I make to you of these workes, and that you'l not be displeased, that I style my selfe at the beginning of these letters, as well as at the beginning of Agrippina,
My Lord
