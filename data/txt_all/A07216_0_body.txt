SIR, you are like to haue none other accompt for the present than such as Marchant-Factors, after bad markets returne, that is, papers for paymēt, for liuers lines, The which though not so acceptable as more solide re∣turnes, yet giues some satisfactiō for the expenses of time questionable. I haue sent you a discourse of our Countrie penned at the request of friends, for the better satisfaction of our Nobilitie, vn∣polished and rude, bearing the countries badge where it was hatched, onely clothed with plainnesse and trueth. I intreat your fauourable acceptation thereof, as your wonted clemencie hath beene to the Author, if you thinke it may doe good by incouraging any of your Countrie to the interprise, I am willing you publish it, other wise let it bee buried in silence as you shall thinke meetest, and esteeme mee still one of whome you haue power to dispose.
