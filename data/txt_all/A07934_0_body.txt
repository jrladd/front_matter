ANcient Poesie, and
ancient Architecture,
requiring to their excellēce
a like creating and propor∣tionable
Rapture, and be∣ing

alike ouer-topt by the
monstrous Babels of our
Moderne Barbarisme;
Their vniust obscurity, let∣ting
no glance of their tru∣eth
and dignity appear, but
to passing few: To passing
few is their lest apparance
to be presented. Your selfe
then being a Chiefe of that

few, by whom Both are ap∣prehended;
& their beames
worthily measur'd and va∣lew'd.
This little Light of
the one, I could not but ob∣iect,
and publish to your
choise apprehension; especi∣ally
for your most ingenuous
Loue to all Workes, in which
the ancient Greeke Soules

haue appear'd to you. No
lesse esteeming this, woorth
the presenting to any Grea∣test,
for the smalnes of the
woke; then the Authour
himselfe hath beene helde
therfore of the lesse estima∣tion:
huing obtain'd as
much preseruation and ho∣nor,
as the greatest of O∣thers:

the Smalnesse bee∣ing
supplyed with so great∣ly-excllent
Inuention and
Elocution. Nor lacks euen
the most youngly-enamor'd
affection it cotaines, a
Temper graue enough, to
become, both the Sight and
Acceptance of the Grauest.
And therefore, howsoeuer

the mistaking worlde takes
it (whose left hand euer re∣ceyu'd
what I gaue with my
Right.) If you freely and no∣bly
ntertaine it, I obtaine
my End: your Iudicious
Loues continuance, being
my onely Obiect: To which

I at all partes commend.
