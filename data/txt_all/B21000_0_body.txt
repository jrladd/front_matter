Madam,
IN obedience to your command I have done into English for the use of some vertuous persons under your charge, not only that piece most proper, of the discipline and habit of Vir∣gins, but the other two, which you esteemed not impertinent. When you shall be pleased to compare my English with the holy Authors Latin, you will easily discern, that I have pick∣ed my matter, and used a liberty in expressing it, to the end I might deliver that which is fittest, and the better set forth the sense and spirit of this glorius Martyr. A considerable addition hereunto, as touching Virginity, might be made out of the treatises of other antient Fathers; but I will wait for your further order, and for the present kissing your hand take my leave.
