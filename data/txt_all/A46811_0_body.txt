Right worshipfull,
HAving but a very few years since published, for the good of those that desire to reade the Scripture with understanding, Certain short Notes of Exposition upon the five books of Moses, and finding that they have been entertained by many with farre greater esteem and appro∣bation then ever I expected, or they deserved: I have now ad∣ventured to send forth the rest after them, which I had then ly∣ing by me; to wit, the like Notes upon the remaining histori∣call part of the old Testament, and indeed I did then in a man∣ner engage my self by promise, that if those found welcome, these ere long should follow after; and having been often since pressed to make good that promise, by the importunity of ma∣ny Christian friends, but especially those of my reverend bre∣thren in the Ministery, whose judgement I prized above mine

own, there lay an obligation upon me for the satisfying of their desires, which I could not gainsay.
Now as the first part of these Annotations I did then dedi∣cate to that particular congregation, which the Lord hath been pleased to commit to my care, so this second part I now make bold to present unto you, who above twenty years since were also pleased to choose me to dispense the word of grace unto you, at some set times of your solemn meetings; and whom in many other respects I have great cause to love and honour. It were indeed engagement enough, if there were nothing else, to endear my affections to this worthy Society, that my dear father, (whose memory is precious with me) and both his brothers were whilest they lived, members of this Company, and in their times too honoured with those places of credit and trust, which since your selves have severally born. But be∣sides this it is well known, how much I owe you (and I wil∣lingly thus declare it, that this may remain as a publick testi∣mony of my thankfulnesse to you) not onely for the great love and respect you have ever shown to me upon all occasi∣ons, but also especially for the bounteous support which for divers years you have been pleased to afford to one of mine for my sake.
Adde therefore, I beseech you, to your former favours, the gracious acceptance of this piece of my labours; and the God of all grace improve it to you, for your spirituall advantage. Histo∣ries of former times have been ever acknowledged both most pleasant, and most profitable, (if a faire prospect from a high hill be so pleasing to the eye, how pleasant must it needs be to the mind of man, to have the memorable passages of ancient times presented to our view in a fair prospect of History, as if we had then lived to see those things done?) But above all, it must needs be thus in the History of the Scripture; both be∣cause

this chiefly acquaints us with the dispensations of Gods providence towards his Church, the dearly beloved of his soul, in comparison of whom, the rest of the world is not worth the regarding, and likewise, because this was written by the uner∣ring pen of men inspired by the holy Ghost, and that pur∣posely too (as the Apostle saith,) for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. But what need I commend to you the usefulnesse of any part of Gods word, which I hope you esteem with David, above thousands of Gold and silver? If these Annotations shall afford any help for the under∣standing of such passages in these books, as may seem at first somewhat intricate and obscure, I have my desire. My prayer shall ever be for this worthy Company, that the word of Christ may dwell in you richly in all wisdome, and that God would still raise up many amongst you, that may be to others patterns of piety and zeal for Gods truth, in this honourable City; and so I rest,
