THE unparallel'd Charity of this Kingdom to the Distressed Protestants of Ireland, who in such numbers during their late heavy Persecution, fled hither as to their Asylum, has made so sensible impressions upon all grateful Men amongst them, that even the providing for their own future safety, seems not more their present aim and desire, than making all possible returns to those who when they were hungry fed them, naked cloathed, and banished their own Country, received them with open Arms. But when both these Consi∣derations, that of Gratitude, as well as a lasting Settlement, are so in∣terwoven as that what provides for the one, will be some Manifestation of the other, 'twere unpardonable, if the People of Ireland should let slip such an opportunity. The Expence of reducing that Kingdom has not been so inconsiderable, but that every Man in England has felt his share of the weight, but the Fatal Consequences of that Rebellion few People consider, for in truth the whole Charge of the Two last years War, be∣sides what more it may cost England, is purely due hereto. Had that Kingdom submitted to Their Majesties Government when publick no∣tice was given them, of their Right to the Crown of England, and con∣sequently to that of Ireland, the French King had long since been obli∣ged to have sued for Peace on such Terms as Their Majesties, and their Allies would have granted him; but such was the necessity of Reducing that Kingdom as soon as it was possible (least, as 'tis plain, it was de∣signed, it should entirely fall into the French King's Hands) that Their Majesties were obliged to employ those Forces there, who in one Cam∣paign, or two at most, would then have effected what already has pro∣ved the work of five: The Consumption of the Treasure of England hereby has been prodigious, but not to be named in Comparison with the Lives of so many Brave English Men, whose Widows and Orphans, as well as their Country, owe this Irrepairable Loss to Ireland. And

now that Kingdom is reduced, the greatest Care must always be taken by the English to secure themselves at home, by preventing its falling into Forreign Hands, and of all Nations in the World, France the most dangerous; they in less than an Age have so encreased their Power at Sea, that they now vye their Fleet with our Royal Navy; and in Trade have so grown upon us, that 'tis certain had they the Irish Harbours, our Trade must be absolutely in their Power, and such, and only so much would fall to our share, as they should think fit to allow us. This was the greatest Consideration that mov'd the Parliament of England so freely and largely to Tax this Nation, for Reducing the Rebels of Ire∣land, though at the same time the great Benefit that would accrue to England by the Forfeitures in Ireland was sufficiently inculcated. Expe∣rience in all former Ages has taught us, that upon the least Troubles, or even appearance thereof in England, the Irish have laid hold of every opportunity of encreasing them, and shaking off the English Yoak; Is then this Nation so entirely secure at this time? And so wholly free from all apprehensions of any Distractions or Troubles that may hereafter be∣fall us, that it is not worth their utmost care so to settle the English Inte∣terest of Ireland, as that it may not be in the power of the Irish to let in an Enemy at our Back-door; instances there are beyond number of their willingness at all times to Ruin England, and can this Age answer it to Posterity, if they let slip the present opportunity put into their Hands, whereby they may for ever put it out of the power of the Irish again to Rebel.
In order to which (after that Kingdom was Reduced) the House of Commons taking the same into their Consideration, as well as the great Expence England had been put to for Reducing Ireland, and thinking it most equitable that what had cost them so much, should as far as 'twould go be applyed to the use of the War, did most humbly address His Ma∣jesty herein, who was graciously pleased on Monday the Fifth of January Ninety, to tell them, That no Grants of the Forfeited Estates in England or Ireland should be made till there should be another opportunity of setling that matter in Parliament in such manner as should be thought most ex∣pedient.
The Kingdom of Ireland having now been Reduced above two years, 'twas thought a very near estimate of the Value of the Irish Forfeitures might be made, and in order to lessen the Charge of England as much as might be, 'twas mov'd by a Worthy Member of the Honourable House of Commons, That the Value of the Irish Forfeitures might be exami∣ned; pursuant to which Motion the Proposer gave an account thereof at the Bar of the House, and afterwards he and several Gentlemen of Ire∣land delivered the following Proposals to a Committee of the House of Commons appointed to receive Proposals concerning the Forfeitures in Ire∣land, and likewise for securing the Protestant Interest there. The Com∣mitee

having reported these Proposals, the House upon Debate of the Matter came to this following Resolution, on Friday the Twelfth of Ja∣nuary 1693. That a Bill be brought in to Vest the Forfeited Estates in Ire∣land in Their Majesties, to be applied to the use of the War. Pursuant to which Resolution a Bill was brought into the House, has been Read a Second time, and ordered to be committed to a Committee of the whole House.
The Irish being Alarm'd hereat, have privately handed about a Pam∣phlet by way of Answer to the Proposals; whether it be so or not is re∣ferred to every unprejudiced Reader, and that he may have the whole Matter fairly before him, the Proposals, the Answer, and Reply are here presented to him: If it appear that the Calculation is reasonable, and that the Answer either avoids the most material Parts, or Refutes no part of the Proposal, he cannot sure but think that a Million of Money sav'd at this time to this Nation, is a piece of Service that deserves Ac∣ceptance, which is all that the Proposer, or those concerned with him, aim at, or desire; but if to this is added undeniable proof, that this me∣thod alone can in humane probability prevent future Rebellions in Ireland, and thereby save both the Treasure and Blood of England; sure no Man can take Exception to it, but either such as are to lose their Estates, or those who may and do entertain hopes of having great ones given them. Now whether doing what in Gratitude is due to the People of England, as well as a Justice to them, and the future Security of the English In∣terest of Ireland can by any Honest or Good Men be omitted on these ac∣counts, cannot admit of a Dispute.
