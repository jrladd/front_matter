WHereas we know no other meanes under God, to divert the just Judgements which he hath executed against the Church of the Laodi∣ceans, for the luke-warmenesse in Rebellion, or a∣gainst the Church of Thyatira, for keeping Sedu∣cers, nor to prevent our eminent dangers, but by a most necessary and speedy executing of the Lawes of God and the King. We doe therefore desire to certifie, that we are resolved to live and dye in the Faith of the Protestant Religion; (knowing no o∣ther meanes of Salvation) and that we will defend it with our Lives and Goods, which that we may with our abilities, be encouraged in performing.
We humbly above all things desire, that wee may be secured, a happy Reformation aforded, and the Lawes of God and the King without fa∣vour or delay, justly put in execution against Papists.
