SVch is the wilfull pouertie
of iudgements (sweet Ma:) wandring
like pasportles men, in contempt of the
diuine discipline of Poesie, that a man
may well feare to frequent their walks:
The prophane multitude I hate, & one∣lie
cnsecrate my strange Poems to these
serching spirits, whō learning hath made
noble, and nobilitie sacred; endeuuring that materiall Oration,
which y call Schema; varying in som rare fiction, from po∣pular
custome, euen for the pre sakes of ornament and vtilitie;
This of Euripides xceeding sweetly relishing with ee; Len∣tem
coquens ne quicquam dentis addito.
But that Poesie should be as peruiall as Oratorie, and plain∣nes
her speciall ornarnt, were the plaine way to barbarisme:
and to make the Asse runne proude of his eares; to take away
strngth from Lyons, and giue Cammels hornes.
That, Enargia, or cleerenes of representation, requird in ab∣solute
Poems is not the perspicuous deliuery of a lowe inuention;
but high, and harty inuention exprest in most significant, and vn∣affected
phrase; it serues not a skilfull Painters turne, to draw the
figure of a face onely to make knowne who it represents; but hee
must lymn, giue luster, shaddow, and heightning; which though
ignorants will esteeme spic'd, and too curious, yet such as haue the
iudiciall perspectiue, will see it hath, motion, spirit and life.
There is no confection made to last, but it is admitted more
cost and skill then presenly to be vsed simples; and in my opinion,
that which being with a little endeuour serched, ads a kinde of ma∣iestie
to Poesie; is better ten that which euery Cobler may sing to
his patch.
Obscuritie in affection of words, & indigested concets, is pedan∣ticall
and childish; but where it shroudeth it selfe in the hart of his
subiect, vtterd with fitnes of figure, and expressiue Epethites; with

that drknes wil I still labour to be shaddowed; rich Minerals are
digd out of the bowels of the earth, not found in the superficies and
dust of it; charms made of vnlerned characters are not consecrate
by the Muses which are diuine artists, but by Euippes daughters,
that challengd them with meere naure, whose brests I doubt not
had beene well worthy commendation, if their comparison had not
turnd them into Pyes.
Thus (not affecting glory for mine owne sleight labors, but de∣sirous
other should be more worthely glorious, nor professing sacred
Poesie in any degree,) I thought good to submit to your apt iudg∣ment:
acquainted long since with the true habit of Posie, and
now since your labouring wis endeuour heauen-high thoughts of
Nature▪ you haue actual meanes to sound the philosophical conceits,
that my new pen so seriously courteth. I know, that empty, and dark
spirits, wil complaine of palpable night: but those that before-hand,
haue a radiant, and light-bearing intellect, will sy they can passe
through Corynnas Garden without the helpe of a Lanterne.
