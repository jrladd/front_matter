THe chefe and principall thing (right honorable) apertaining to euery honorable personage (which thing is good too see that your honor doth well consider) is to walke in the garden of humilitie: & the direct way to the same, is to passe by the gate of vertu, whose foūdacion is ankerd to the fear and loue of God: for as by the one is couered the multitude of sinns, so by the other is obteyned ble¦sednes, wysdō, and knowledge, whose godly preseuerāce therin will (no dought) much multyply the great and blessed benefits of almighty God, vpon your honour and all your whole seede and po∣steritie, Knowing therfor (ryght honorable) the great loue and affection which your honour euer hath and doth beare to vertu and good letters, I was therby moued the more boldly after I had prin¦ted this worke for the Lute deuided into three books: (the first an easey and playne methode to set al songs of eyght diuers tunes in tablature for the lute, the secōd how to hādel the lute, the third and last cōteineth diuers excelent tunes) to dedycate the same to your honour, nothynge doutinge but that it shall most acceptably come into your fauorable and sure protection. I therfore most humbly besech your honor too take this small gift in good part, which cōming as it were from your honor into the hands of many shall (I dought not) do many good. God whose holy word your honour doth most feruently loue and most ernesty practice in your daily cōuersation, mough vouchsafe to preserue your honour and your vertuous children in continuall helth and daily increase of honour, vnto the glory of his name.
