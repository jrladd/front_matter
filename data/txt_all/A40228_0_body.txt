FRIENDS,
THE Pearl is hid in the field, and the field is the World, and the World is in your hearts, and there you must dig deep to find it, and when you have digged deep & found it, you must sell all to purchase and redeem this field, and there you shall know the Merchants man that makes the Ex∣change, and there shall you know Christ in you the hope of glory, to save you, and redeem you, the Im∣manuel, God with us; and there shall you know the Woman that lost the piece of silver, and was seeking it without; but when the candle was lighted, and the house swept, she found it in her own house, and then she did know the joy, and went and told her neighbours; and then she did know the day-star rise in her heart, and the day dawning whereby the light shal be known, that shines from the East to the West, and the word of faith in the mouth and heart, & the oyl is in thy Lamp if thou enter in with the Bridegroom; the light shines in thine own heart to give thee the light of the know∣ledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, from whence it comes, and the anointing which abideth in thee will teach thee, and as it doth teach thee thou shalt continue in the Father and the Son, from whence this holy Ʋnction comes, and hast received it, and here thou shalt know that thou need no man to teach thee, but as the same anointing doth teach thee, and the ingrafted word, able to save your souls, is in your hearts, and the hidden man of the heart, which is renewed day by day is found there, and the
meek and quiet spirit, which is with the Lord of great price, is found in thee, and the Covenant of grace that brings salvation is in thy heart, and in thy mouth, to season it and thy words, and to teach thee to deny all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and the heap of Teachers set up by mens lusts in the World, that turn this grace into wantonnesse, and lives wildely, and it will teach thee to live soberly.
The Devil went from the truth, and deceived the na∣tions, and abode not in it, and he rules in all the hearts of the children of disobedience, that obeys not the truth, he that went out of the truth, and so they become Syna∣gogues of Sathan, and so murderers. Cain went from the truth, the Jews went from the truth, and so of the Devil the false prophets, Antichrists, inwardly ravened from the truth, and so all these turned against the just, murde∣rers, & so who is come to the just that they ravened from, over all these they reign, and brings people to God, to reign over all this thats out of the truth, and contrary to it.
All you high gazing Professors and hypocrites. The Kingdom of heaven is within you (like unto a grain of mustard-seed, like unto leaven) that comes not by observations, who are and have been gazing for it without you.
