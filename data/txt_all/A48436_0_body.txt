Madam,
WHen I consider the unex∣pressible Honour I lately had of being frequently a partaker with You at the Throne of Grace, in Your Chappel-Devotion at the Hague; Where, observing Your great Strength and Zeal of true Piety, accompanied with a perfect Stability of Humility, Meekness, and Lowliness of Spirit, as a com∣pleat Follower, and Imitator of our
Dear Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, whilst on Earth; it struck such a Dint upon me,As St. Au∣stin says, melted down his Soul into Di∣vine Affecti∣ons. and enforc'd such a Love of Religion in me, that made me inspir'd to that height and Ecstacy of Devotion, and Intenti∣on of Thought, that did not only, as it were, withdraw my Soul from all Commerce with the Senses, but in a manner separate it a while from the Body: And made it, with the Apostle Paul, to have Antipasts of Heaven, and a fruition of Coe∣lestial Enjoyments.
Such Raptures, Elevations, and Influences of Anticipated Glory, as the Apostle had, had the Disciples of our Saviour, whilst their Great Lord and Master was Predicting and Communicating his Passion to be an abiding Commemoration of himself amongst them, after his Ascension into Glory, as it is largely
set forth by our Saviour himself throughout the 6th Chapter of John.
And as it was observ'd of Peter, and the rest of his Brethren, in the Transfiguration of our Saviour on the Mount, that when he Pray'd earnestly to his Father, the Fashion of his Countenance was alter'd, which did beget immediately in them, such a Participation of Raptures, and Ejaculations, that made them very unwilling to relinquish the Place, where they had enjoy'd such a Beati∣fical Presence.
The like have I perceiv'd in Your Majesties Countenance, as if it spake aloud the very Language of Your Divine Soul, that made mine always wish, in its Publick Devoti∣on, to live in the Presence of so Great and so Glorious an Exem∣plar.
No less perfect are all these Coele∣stial Qualifications in Your ever
Ador'd and Dearly beloved Sister; to enumerate them again were but Tautology; they are all so essentially compact in You both, that modestly and justly You are the Glory of the Ʋniverse. The Hypostatick Coun∣cil of Heaven having decreed it from all Eternity, that You Two shoud be Leaders and Patterns to all Sincere and Devout Subjects and Christians, in all Virtue, Piety, and Holiness, and that they be close Imi∣tators and Followers of You, as You are of Christ.
This makes it transcendently the Felicity of all Humble, Pious Souls, to have Two such Matchless Guar∣dian Angels walk before us, and to be eminent for God in Your Gene∣rations, as the aforesaid Mary and Anna, the Mother of Jesus, and Prophetess of our Lord.
How much more Glorious must the Protestant Religion necessarily appear in You, Madam, now You
are, by the All-wise Providence of the Great God, most happily arriv'd at the Zenith of Sovereignty, whose Sovereign Beams have alrea∣dy dispers'd all those Clouds and Mists, (nay, Storms and Hurri∣cans) of Popery, that of late had like to have subverted and over-whelm'd these Nations into a Bloo∣dy Deluge by Massacre and Murder, had not God reserv'd Your Majesty for such a day as This, and brought You safe through the dangers of the Seas, and plac'd Your Royal Person with King William on the Imperial Throne of Your Ancestors, whose un∣daunted Magnanimity and Resoluti∣on, by the Omnipotent Power of the Almighty, hath procur'd this re-esta∣blishment for us again; That when all our hopes were sinking in the Au∣tumn of Despair, God was pleas'd through him, by a stupendious Mi∣racle, to restore us again, without the tedious and cruel Sieges of War
or Blood, to a Protestant Settle∣ment and Blessing.
This is the only cause, that em∣boldens me to present to You the fol∣lowing Meditations and Contem∣plations of the Agony and Crucifixi∣on of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Entituled, The La∣masa-bachthani, or, Cry of the Son of God, wherein I have en∣deavour'd, as succinctly, and as per∣spicuously, as possibly I could, to set forth every Action and Trans∣action of the Chief Priests, Scribes, Elders, and Soldiers, towards their accomplishing of their wicked De∣sign in perfecting of the so much hunger'd for Crucifixion of our Dear Lord and Saviour.
How he was hurry'd and carry'd from one Place, Court, and Council, to another, Spit on and Buffeted in one, Array'd and Rob'd in another, Scourg'd and Crown'd with Thorns in another, mock'd and derided in
all, but acquitted and discharg'd by none, and yet not found guilty of Death in any.
I have follow'd the Evangelists as close as I could, and have rank'd them as well as I am able, in so small a thing, and have made the rough Draught as like the Original, as I can possible, in suitable Expressions, and earnestly beg of God it may please all, and displease none, being all Divine Truths.
I most humbly present it to Your Majesty, hoping it may receive a Candid and free Acceptation from You. It will lye in a little Room in Your Closet, and at the Table of the Lord, being more fitted for the Heart of a Devout and Pious Soul, than Voluminous, therefore may be as the Viand of the Soul in its near∣est Addresses to its Saviour, before, and after it comes to be an actual partaker of the Body and Blood of a Redeemer, whom I have end a∣vour'd
to Delineate as well as I am able, in so small a Tract, in the ut∣most extremity of his Crucifixion; in his Agony and Bloody Sweat, on his Cross and Passion; in his Death and Burial, and there left his most precious Body in the Grave, with Holy Angels, to attend his Call: I may hereafter presume to write of his Glorious Resurrection and Ascen∣sion also, if I can find my weak En∣deavours are in any degree useful, according to the Pious and Honest Intention of,
MADAM,
