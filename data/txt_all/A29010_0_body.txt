My Dearest Sister,
YOu receive in this Effect of
my Obedience, one of the
highest Proofs I can give
You of its Greatness. For
when You Command but things that
tend to Your Service, the Performance
is wont to be accompanied with
a Satisfaction, that suffers me not to
find it Ʋneasy. But I confess it was
not without Reluctancy, that I was
prevailed with to venture abroad
Composures, wherein, even when I
publish Them, I decline Owning them,

and which, (if our Names be disco∣ver'd)
may I fear, not only hazzard
the Reputation (if it have any)
of my Pen; but, (where You are less
known) bring into Question that of
Your Judgment. 'Twas easie for me to
represent to You how unfinished and
unpolished the Trifles you called for,
were, especially considering that the Im∣matureness
of some of them would not
probably be the Chief thing that would
make many think they come forth Ʋn∣seasonably,
since they avowedly Aim
at the Persuading and Teaching men
to Improve their Thoughts, as well as
Husband their Time, at a season, when
both those Pretious Things are so Neg∣lected,
or so Mis-imploy'd, that the
chief use, which too many make of the
Former, is to devise wayes to get ridd
of the Later. But though to my Ʋn∣readiness
to Publish these very long
neglected Papers, at the same time

when a Prae-engagement oblig'd me to
Dispatch another Treatise of a quite
different Nature, I added all those o∣ther
dissuading Considerations that I
have mentioned in the Preface to the
Reader; yet what I represented proved
as Ʋnavailable, as what I had writ∣ten
was In-compleat. For, whilst You
fancied that the following Reflections
(such as they are) had Fewer Faults,
and were like to do More Good, than I
can presume; Your Charity for others,
and Partiality for me, made you so reso∣lute
and pressing to have me run a
Venture, which you are pleas'd to
think but a very Small One; that I
judged it more excusable to present you
Green Fruit, than, by obstinately Refu∣sing
what you seemed almost to Long
for, lose an opportunity of Evincing,
That Your Commands can Prevail, both
where those of Others would have been
wholly Ineffectual, and when they re∣quired

me to present You (some, if not
many,) things that are so little worthy
of You, that perhaps they are scarcely
so, ev'n of me.
Wonder not, Dear Sophronia, that
I appear so Sollicitous to manifest the
Greatness of my Obedience; since That
implyes an Ʋrgency in your Commands,
that it highly concerns me to have ta∣ken
notice of. For those that, having
the Happiness to converse with You,
shall chance to cast their Eyes upon
the following Papers, will probably
think that I shew as little Discretion in
the Address, as I have shewn Skill in
the writing, of these Reflections; when
I expose such Censurable Things to the
Judgment of a Person that has so pier∣cing
a One, and present Trifles to one,
that deserves the Noblest Producti∣ons
of (what she is so great a Mistress
of) Wit, and Eloquence. Ʋpon whose
Account she is wont to persuade Piety

as Handsomly in her Discourses, as she
expresses it Exemplarily in her Acti∣ons;
and might, if her Modesty did less
confine her Pen to Excellent Letters,
both make the Wits of our Sex envy a
Writer of Hers; and keep Our Age from
envying Antiquity, for those Celebrated
Ladies, who, by their Triumphant Elo∣quence,
Ennobled the People of Rome,
and taught their Children to Sway
those Rulers of the World.
But when I can plead, that not only
Your Commands, but even Your Impor∣tunity
ingaged me (though not to the
Address, yet) to the Publication of
these Papers; I may reasonably hope,
that among those many considerable
Persons to whom Your Attainments are
not unknown, not only my Dedication
will be Excused, but even my Book will
not be so hastily Condemned.
But I dare not prosecute so Fruit∣full
a Subject, for fear of offending Your

Modesty; since that predominant Vir∣tue
gives You so great an Ʋndervalu∣ation
for all Your other Qualities, that
it is as much Your Custome to look
ev'n upon Smal Praises as Flatteries,
as it is Your Prerogative to keep Great
ones from being so. And I should
therefore have omitted that little it
self which I have said, if, on This occa∣sion,
my Interest did not as well Ob∣lige
me, as the known Truth Warrant
me, so to Consider Your Modesty, as
not to be altogether Injurious to Your
other Excellencies; since the Reader's
knowledge of These (if he be not a
strnager to You) will promise me this
Advantage, that divers of the Cri∣ticks
themselves will chuse rather to
Absolve my Writings, than Condemn
Your Judgment: and that at least,
the Devout, to whom Your Practice has
afforded so many other Examples, will
be scrupulous to be more Severe to these

Papers, than a Person in whom, upon
the score of her own Style, Severity
were more justifiable than in most Rea∣ders
(without excepting the Eloquent
Ones) and will imitate Her, in Consi∣dering,
that this Book pretends to
present them Thoughts, rather than
Words, and in Supporting, for the sake
of the Design, the Manner in which it
is prosecuted.
And certainly, my Lady R's. Ap∣probation,
is a Happiness which divers
sorts of Considerations may render as
Advantageous as Welcome to me. For
if any of these Thoughts, do (which
yet I can scarce hope) derive it from Your
Justice, that great measure of Esteem
You do not only Merit, but Possess,
may both Assure them of a General
One, and much contribute to Procure it
them. But if all of them owe your Ap∣probation
(as I fear they do) to your
Partiality; since that must not be▪ Small

to be able to pervert such a Judgment,
This it self will prove an Evidence of
the Blessing of Your Affection; which is
a Felicity, that I know You enough to
value above all the Praises I can miss
of: since Applause can make me happy
but in other Mens Opinion, but Your
Friendship can make me so in my own.
Yet, apprehend not, Sister, That I
should here endeavor, by a solemn Cha∣racter
of You, to justifie what I have
been saying: For, though to write a
Dedicatory Epistle, without a Panegy∣rick,
be grown of late very Ʋnfashiona∣ble;
yet since 'tis as much so, to take
the Praises wont to be profusely given
in such Letters for Measures of any
thing but the Writers Wit, I must ra∣ther
reserve the Acknowledgments I
ow Your Merit and Your Favors to
some Occasion, where they may not be
lyable to pass for a Tribute paid to Cu∣stome,
not a Debt due to You; than

draw a needless Suspition upon the Sin∣cerity
of our Friendship, by endeavour∣ing
to express my Affection and E∣steem
in a Dedicatory Letter; and by
chusing to Profess, upon an Occasion
where Custom allows men to Say what
they do not Think, so Great and Real a
Truth, as that of my being, far more up∣on
the Account of Esteem and Grati∣tude,
than of Nature it self,
My Dearest Sister,
