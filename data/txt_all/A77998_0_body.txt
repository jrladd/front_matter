Honoured Sir,
IF a Heathen Poet could say, Non omnis moriar, I shall live though I die; supposing his Works im∣mortal, though himselfe were mortal; Upon how much better an account may a Prophet of the Lord say, Non moriar, sed vivam, I shall not die, but live; both in respect of his immortall
soule, to which death is as the gate of life; and in respect of the immortall travell of his soule, being conversant in the Word of the Lord that abideth for ever.
The workes of the Saints of God in whom is the spirit of prophecie, not onely live when they are dead; but are instrumentall in the hand of grace, both to plant life where it is not, and water it where it is, that it may spring forth more abundantly.
The chosen Vessell of the Lord, by whose Ministry he was pleased to give out the Heavenly treasures laid up in these Sermons, hath some yeares since put off his earth, and put on that Inheritance of the Saints in light, for which the Lord seemed earlie to have fitted him, by his earnest and
assiduous Travail in fitting others. But though the Vessel be broken, or rather indeed refined and translated to his Masters more immediate use, yet the treasures abide for the common enrich∣ment of the Saints. For spirituall trea∣sures (like the loaves blessed by our Saviour) multiply in their use, and when thousands have been enriched by them, do still remain sufficient to enrich thousands.
To you honoured Sir, is this small but Precious treasury presented, not as though your own store were not already full; for who knowes not how many precious Jewels (through the riches of Christ in you) you have richly set and polished for the ador∣ning the Bride the Lambs wife? Sure∣ly the spirit of Christ seems to have
chosen and sealed your Spirit to cele∣brate his own Nuptials in your Mysti∣cal Marriage and song of loves.
But as gold, besides its own internal worth, receives an Authentick impressi∣on from the Image and Superscription of the Prince: And as in honouring the Lord with the best part of our sub∣stance, An humble acknowledgement of his Interest both in the whole and our selves (not any Addition to his fulnesse) is intended: So is this Trea∣sury presented to the touch and test of your Judgement, First as the Stan∣dard of approving things that are ex∣cellent. And then as an humble te∣stimony how much he owes himselfe to you that presents it.
That the Lord would make you long an Ornament and defence to
his Saints, and prosper his own pleasure in your hands, is the prayer of,
Honoured Sir,
