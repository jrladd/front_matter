May it please Your Grace,
AS Your Graces Commands for publi∣cation of this ensuing Sermon, has put it beyond my power to conceal that from your Eye, which I thought very unwothy of your Ear; (though your Grace was pleas'd out of your great respect to my deceased Lord, to Honor it with Your presence, when it was deliverd) so the small opinion I have of its worth, and the no ad∣vantage which (I am sure) it will add to my re∣putation, (being designed for a Country Auditory, where the Funeral was intended to be Selemnis'd) forces me to prefix Your Graces Name unto it: that I may not onely by its being own'd by Your Grace, be secur'd from the many censures which (I have cause to fear) shall pass upon me; but also,
that the thing it self may be render'd the more con∣siderable, and carry the greater authority with it. I know (my Lord) Your Grace cannot be offended at this presumption: because it makes for the vin∣dicating of of a person; who (I am certain) was no less Your Grace; freind, then Your Grace most justly deserv'd: for that now your Grace has given the most convincing proofs of your Freindship, by Your endeavouring (seeing he cannot be his own compurgatour) to wipe of that dirt which some  out of malice and others for the supporting of their tottering interest bave cast upon him to which if what I have here said, may give but the least assistance, I have (next unto your Graces pardon for this my confidence) all I desire: because I there∣by discharge my duty unto my honored Lord, and have this oportunity offer'd, of publishing to the world, that I own my self to be in the deepest sense of duty, and gratitude imaginable.
May it please Your Grace,
August 22. 1665.
