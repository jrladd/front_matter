OVT of the deare and du∣teous affecti∣on, which
 both by the Lawes of God, iustice of nature, and vnreproueable rule of rightfull obedience, I owe vnto your most royall Father, my dread Soueraigne, and next vnto your Princely self; I offer to your gracious acceptance this poore and homely present, more rich in substance, then in outward appea∣rance, & yet farre more highly dignified, if it be bt deigned your royall fauor. I haue beene so bold, (by aduise of good iudgement, and in re∣gard of some small me∣rit,
 which these Prayers and Meditations are thought to carrie) to entitle them, The Prin∣ces Prayers. Not presu∣ming to square you a method for meditating, or imagining them any way worthie your vse, but onely, as another small Treatise of like nature, which hath long time beene extant, vn∣der name of The Kings Psalmes and The Queenes Prayers, haue had happy passage in the world, & (no doubt) done much good: Euen so, your Princely name, but gra∣cing
 these religious ex∣ercises, and they bearing your countenance to future cōtinuance, more profit may arise (by thē) then can be rashly pro∣mised, and renown your vertues beside, to end∣lesse remembrance.
I must confesse (and am the more sorrie for it) that the Book comes not in such seemely ma∣ner, as I could haue wi∣shed, or as befitted so Princelie a Patrones view, both in regard of mine owne slender abi∣litie, to performe matter of such moment, with
 aunswerable stile and phrase; as also the Prin∣ters too many imperfe∣ctions, which although they haue vnwillingly (I dare say) escaped, yet might haue beene farre better respected. But if your Grace shall please to burie both our de∣fects, in the truely roy∣all affabilitie of your Princely minde, and in place of all wants, to let good will supplie the roome; I haue what I desire, and which I will endeuour also hereafter much better to deserue. Remaining now & euer
 in hearty prayer, for your health and hap∣pinesse: That no foule heart or hand at any time come neare you; no annoyance disturbe you, or euill thought of∣fend you; but the hand of heauen for euer to blesse you, and this land of Great Britaine long to enioy you.
