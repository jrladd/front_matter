My LORD,
PRoductions of the Brain, like the Noble Fruit of the Vine, have always had the For∣tune to be Coveted and Desir'd; Yet how Rich and Generous soever

the Crop, the Stock it Sprang from, could never have arriv'd at sufficient Strength to sustain its own Weight, and Erect it self, had not Art found out Means to supply its Wants of Nature by re∣clining it on, and propping it up with Trunks of abler Plants: So likewise the Generosity of the Great, in all Ages, has afforded comfortable Support to the Humble Self-dejected Writer, without which he must have continued a poor Groveling Reptile, expos'd to the Insults and Tramplings of Ig∣norance and Barbarity.
My LORD,
'Tis the Sense of this Necessity has so often given Persons of highest Rank and Merit, the Trouble of this Nature; and whih, I must needs own, has

wholly directed me in this Address. Your Lordship could not reasonably expect to lie hid, after having been so Publickly and Honour∣ably Pointed out, and Distinguish'd even by the Wisest, as well as Bravest Prince that ever fill'd our Throne: Nor, that the Muses should any longer forbear giving publick Te∣stimony of their Satisfaction in the Advancement of Virtue and Merit. Permit me therefore, My Lord, to Congratulate both you and the Nation in the Happy Choice of our most Auspicious Sovereign, who has singled you out for a Title, which receives as much Lustre from your Person, as your Lordship de∣rives from it.
The World may Envy, but can never Blame me, for this early En∣deavour to Plant my self in so Rich a Soil as your Lordship's Favour;

where I may enjoy the Warmth of the Reflected Beam's of that Sun, whose happy Influence not only ours, but even the greater Part of the Eu∣ropean World, Rejoyce and Flou∣rish under.
It was the Happiness of our Learned Author, whose Version is humbly offered to your Lordship, to be Favourite and Chief Minister to the greatest Heroe, as well as Prince of his Time; and in that Right, My Lord, he seems very naturally to have a Claim to your Lordship's Protection, in whose Power it is to Introduce him to a Greater Heroe than any that Age could boast of; A Prince whose happy Influence makes Virtue spring so fast at home; and whose Prudence takes care to transplant Merit so from abroad, that, like the most curious Plants, both Honour and Illustrate our

Island: Among these your Lordship must needs be acknowledged the First and Most Deserving, even by those who envy your Fortune, whilst the Impartial, of which I am proud to profess my self one, with Ioy Applaud, and wish a long Conti∣nuance of it. I am,
My LORD,
