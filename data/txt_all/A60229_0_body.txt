SIR,
THE Women of Rome offer'd Jewels, The Greeks Silver and Gold, Sylla his Bloud, and Jeptha his onely Child for Victory; But your Majesty made no such Offe∣rings, And yet obtained a Greater Vi∣ctory than any of them, A Victory without Bloud: And as it is th' Highest Victory that hath been gained, So, in forgiving Your Enemies, Your Majesty hath taken th' Highest Revenge; And as very Acceptable to God, Because Forgiveness proceeds from th' Heart, And, that God, for Christs Sake hath forgiven Us.
The Prince that is Feared hath cause to Fear, And, tis safer for Princes to be Beloved for their Clemency, than Feared for their Punishments; The Law of the Jewes was the Law of Fear, But of Christians, the Law of Love, And th' Enemies of Caesar did more envie the Pard'ning of the Pompeians, than the Killing of Pompey; Caesar is very Eminent in History for Pard'ning of In∣juries, Alexander for giving of Rewards: Yet to th' Un∣thankfull person Alexander would not give a Reward, nor Caesar Pardon an Injury: And ther's nothing that moves God to be less Carefull of us, than Ingratitude; which like the Sea, turns Fresh springs into Salt water, and may mind them of their Duty and Gratitude, who are Guilty of the contrary.

 To present Your Majesty with a Serious Frenchman in an English Habit is t' invert the Mode and Humour of Court, And t' expose my Confidence to Your Maje∣sties Accurate Judgement in th' Elegancies and Criti∣cismes of th' English and French Languages, which are much Improved by the Learning and Industry of them, who delight in adding t' other mens Inventions; And, were not this Age Curious in th' Advance of Sciences & Arts, They would have their Cadences, and be subject to Mortality with other things; Yet, they that busie themselves too much upon Speculative subtilties, for∣sake the solid Foundations of Religion, and pry so farr into the Nature and unrevealed purposes of God, as to forget the Nature and Duty of Man.
The Subject matter of my Author, is fitted to the Me∣ridian of Statesmen and of State Affaires, and commu∣nicates not onely Politique Essayes, but abstruse Philo∣sophical Notions, which are of Familiar converse with Your Majesty, whose Experience in the Intricacies of Government gives the Rule of Conduct to Your Privie Councellors; And what was said of the French King Lewis th' Eleventh, is verifi'd in Your Majesty, That Your Majestie carries Your Councell with You where∣soe're Your Majesty Goes.
That Your Majesty may be th' Happy Instrument of Good to Church and State is the daily prayer of
