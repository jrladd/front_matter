SIR,
A Famous Ruler in Israel gives us that Re∣port of his own Conduct, Neh. 13 10. 11. I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; Then I contended for them, and said, why is the House of God forsaken? God has made you a Ruler, even one of the Counsellors & Justices, in our little Israel; and tho', I know, nothing is more distastful to you, than a World∣ly, Slthful, Ambitious Clergy, & you are as far as any man I know, from the Character of, Priest ridden; yet you count no sort of men, more Highly to be Esteemed, than Holy, Prayerful, Watchful, Painful, Humble, & Learned Ministers of the Gospel Because when you were informed, that in many Towns, those Men of God, have not their Portions duely given them, you hop'd, that among other wayes of helping it, some Good might be done, by a Monitory Letter to the Negligent; you desired one, who has the least occasion for your Cares about him, to compose it, and are your seif at the charge to Publish it, & Scatter it. The Worthy Ministers, whom you thus desire to see well Supported, have their Graces tryed by their Temptations, & Live by Faith, Eving the Providence of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Provision that He strange∣ly makes for them What if You should now be an Instrument of some Advantage to them, & because to them, to their Flocks also? You will at least meet with this Recompence; while you Speak comfortably unto them, who teach the Good Knowledge of the Lord, they will in their Secret Prayers before the Lord, Remember You & your Family; And whom they Bless, their God will Bless!
