Gentlemen,
I Find it disputed a∣mong
your Casuists,
whether a Book writ∣ten
by a Member of Your Or∣der,
doth belong to the Author

or to the Society; the Argu∣ments
I confess are very weigh∣ty
on both sides; For in behalf
of the Society it is pleaded
with great reason, that by the
Rules of your Order, no par∣ticular
Member is to have pro∣perty
in any thing; and in be∣half
of the Author, that a Book
being the proper issue of his own
Brain, cannot belong to any one
else: Caramuel,Caramu∣el. Com∣mentar. in Regul. S. Bened. n. 831. finding the
difficulties so great, undertakes
to resolve the Case by a very
subtle distinction of the Paper
and Ink of which the Book is
composed, and the Conceptions
of the mind contained therein;

the former he gives to the So∣ciety,
and the latter to the Au∣thor,
which he proves ver
substantially; for, saith he, the
conceptions of the Book being
the outward images of what
was only in the mind of the
Author can belong to no other
than to him that formed them;
but against this ariseth a shrewd
objection, that by this means eve∣ry
man hath right to the Pi∣cture
that is made of him, and
the Painter only to the Canvas
and Colours. To which he
answers very gravely, that the
Picture is not properly th
immediate representation of

the Person, but of that Idea
of him which was in the fan∣cy
of the Painter. But upon
this another Controversie arises
(as we find every day that one
doth beget another) whether
that propriety which the Au∣thor
hath in the Conceptions
of his Book, can be disposed of
by way of Legacy, or no; and
all the resolution I can meet
with is, that it is probable he
may; but on the other side, the
Superiours of the Order may
make use of the contrary pro∣bability,
and challenge the
Book for their own.
It is very well known to

You, that Mr. Cressy was
lately a Member of Your Or∣der,
who was the Author of
the Book, to which this fol∣lowing
Answer is made; What
Right You have challenged in
it I know not, but I think it
not likely he should dispose of
it to any but to Your selves;
since he saith, his first writing
against me was by his Superi∣ours
command, and in this
Book he declares, that what he
writes was not his own opini∣on
alone; and therefore it is
probable you may have 
right to the conceptions, 
as to the Paper and In 

Since his death (which I
knew not of till I had under∣taken
this Service and Duty
in behalf of a Person of Ho∣nour
to whose Kindness I am
so extreamly obliged) I know
not to whom so properly to ad∣dress
my self, as to You, who
were his Superiours; especi∣ally
since there are so many
things in it wherein the Ho∣nour
of Your Order is con∣cerned;
to which I assure you
I bear no malice, no more than
I do to Your Persons, or to
Mr. Cressy's memory. If I
am guilty of mistakes, I beseech
you to correct them with the

same civility that I writ them.
I have of late been somewhat
used to writing, but I am yet
to learn the Art and terms of
Railing, and I hope I shall not
find that any such Legacies are
bequeath'd to you by any of your
Order. I am
Gentlemen,  London, Nov.
14. 1674.
