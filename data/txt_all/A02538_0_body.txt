RIGHT Ho∣norable
I haue
vndertaken a
great taske to
teach men how to be happy
in this life: I haue vnder∣taken
and performed it:

Wherein I haue followed
Seneca and gone beyond
him; followed him as a
Philosopher, gone beyond
him as a Christian, as a
Diuine. Finding it a true
cēsure of the best Moralist,
that they were like to goodly
ships, graced with great
titles the Saue-gard, the
Triumph, the Good-speed,
and such like, when
yet they haue beene both
extreamely Sea-beaten and
at last wracked. The vo∣lume
is little, perhaps the
vse more; I haue euer
thought according to the
Greeke Prouerbe .
What it is,

euen iustice challengeth it
to him, to whom the Au∣thor
hath deuoted himselfe:
The children of the bond∣man
are the goods of the
parents Maister. I humbly
betake it to your Honors
protection, and your Honor
to the protection of the
highest.
