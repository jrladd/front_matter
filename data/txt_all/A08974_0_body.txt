My Lord:
YOu may (I confesse) accuse me of petulancy and ex∣ceeding presumption, in that I farre unworthy and altogether unknowne to your ho∣nour,

should thus dare to attempt the Dedication of this my unpolisht piece to one so eminent in judgment as your excellent Selfe, yet when I contemplate your vertues (whereof humility is chiefe) I am imboldned (in hope of your Honorable pardon) to present this Embrion of my weake braine to your iudicious view: desi∣ring your Lordship to shew your selfe (as you hitherto have bin) the Patterne and Patron of curtesie in ac∣cepting and remitting my booke and my boldnes: the antient Philosophers did decipher a true Noble man by foure excellent qualities which are these: First, A hauty courage in time of Martiall exercise. Secondly, A

heart to iudge. Thirdly, A hand to eward: and Fourthly, Clemency to prdon. I knowing your noble mind to be amply replete with all these vrtuous indowments, what wonder i it that I have thus adventured the Poem, for the excellency of the hi∣story (I confesse) did deserve a more skillfull penman, being a Tragedy so unparaleld, that I wonder why none of our temporary Laureats have un∣dertaken it before: but as I doe re∣ioyce to be advanced to the first place in this worke, so doe I more abun∣dantly exult in that it finds so hono∣rable a Patron My Nightingale fea∣ring the hissing Serpents of this envi∣ous age desires your powerfull wings

to shelter her. And in lieu of your ge¦nerous approbation of her song, my Muse (by you her noble Mecaenas ai∣mated) shall endevour heereafer with a Posie of a sweeter odour o kisse the hand of your Honour. In t interim 'I remaine both in heart tongue and pen,
