Right Honourable,
BEing past controversie, and uni∣versally acknowledged, that bit∣ter Experience is the best Teacher and School-master of fools: a∣mongst which rank I do esteem my self to be inferior to very few; And there∣fore must be educate under such exercises and di∣scipline, as the only wise Parent (who knows well the frame, disposition and inclination of every one of his children) sees meet, for instru∣cting, rectifying, and reclaiming of the blind-born

ignorant, prone to all maner of perversity, out of that naturall darknesse, by the illumina∣tion of the holy Ghost, unto the life of grace whereby God makes himself known to the Elect, and themselves to themselves, and whereby they be moved to hate and abhore themselves, to love and believe Him, so clearly manifested to them▪ that the Devil or his instruments, from with∣out or from within, cannot gain ground so far, against the work of his begun grace, as to raze it. Neverthelesse the subtile Hunter, cruell and vi∣olent Persecutor of such as are thrusting through the strait gate, ceaseth not to prepare and set ma∣ny snares privily in our way: partly by entang∣ling our minds with too much worldly affairs and other vain inventions: and partly by presenting well-polished idols, for our humors, as means of diversion, whereby we be marred in our growth, and come slowly unto maturity. But our only good God, and gracious Father, who, out of his infinite goodnesse, hath begun, knows also how to accomplish his work in every one of his own. For proof whereof, I have made bold to let your Ladyship know, that, after many mul∣tiplied

compassions, unchangeable love, and long-sufferings, wherewith my Lord hath been driving me nearer to Himself: now at length to lead me apart, as it were, out of the world, by a singular and unexpected providence, unto the wildernesse, not to be tempted by the Devil, as my dear Saviour was before me, who alone was able to endure and overcome: but to be allured and enlarged (by freedome from outward, and supply against inward intanglement) to recent the variety of most observable Dispensations wherewith I have been exercised these 70. years, and to read over the Endictment of provocations, upon the travels and troubles that I have been tossed with in that time allotted me: hereto be∣ing sustained under, and rescued from the distra∣ctions of all the trials and temptations that I have tasted of, unto this day: But specially, since the time that, by grace, I have had, in any mea∣sure, my senses exercised, to discern the benefite of his presence and Providence, ordinary and ex∣traordinary: and the burden and bitternesse of his absence, the deepest and darkest hell that the child of God meets with; and therefore carries the

name of Desertion, (albeit not properly) being partiall) and, blessed be the Lord) but tempo∣rall, and not according to the measure. But I forbear, knowing that the exercises of Gods chil∣dren are various and all wonderfull, both in ma∣ner and measure. And seing I have found that the most sad, tart, distractive or destructive whereof I have tasted, whether upon the mind, conscience, name, means, body, or friends, have been prescribed by such wisedome, inflicted by such favour, qualified by such compassion, timed by such prescience, and sweetned by such delive∣rance: and thereby produced such inward conso∣lation, that I have been overcome in admiring and adoring that depth of excellency that hath therein appeared: and thereby become desirous to impart some part thereof unto others, that the Christian Believers, who have been sustained un∣der the like trials, feasted upon the like furniture, and delighted with the like deliverances, may take occasion to renew their songs of thanksgiving and praise to their Royal Provisor, and Captain of their Salvation.
And likewise, that such who scar at the Pro∣fession,

and keep at distance by reason of the Crosse and contumelies that cleave unto the Pro∣fessor, unto whom nothing is certain but what is seen and present: whereas, unto the Believer, things future and unseen for the time, be most certain: and yet will, out of curiosity, glance at every thing, as if they were making use of all things; May know that it is for want of spiritu∣all discerning and senses, so exercised, to taste and smell the sweet fruits of a sanctified Crosse, that keeps them from closing with, and coming under the Colours of the Captain of Salvation, who leads through, and feeds with such freedom and furniture, as should make them sing under all their sufferings.
The project and end of all being, to induce and perswade unto the ardent study of this secret and saving way of God upon the soul, unto convincing and converting, whereby the faith of His eternall Love being increased, all the desires and delights of the heart may be fixed upon, and fervently intended for a Communion with Him, who is altogether delectable and only desirable.
The matter, manner and circumstances being

consonant to Scripture-verity, Scripture-presi∣dent, and the experience of the most sound and sincere, the figures and metaphors familiar and significant, the composing and personating there∣of to the life, whereby the matter may be the more perspicuous, and leave the better impression, I trust shall not offend any. And now, most Noble and truely Religious Lady, although your Ladyship hes been honoured with the patro∣nage of the most exquisite exercise of practicall Divinity that hes seen the light in our dayes, yet I trust your L. shall not esteem it inconsistent with that well deserved reputation enjoyed by you, that your L. name is here most deservedly pre∣fixt as sole Lady and Mistris of this Quire; being so well versed in exercises of this nature, being al∣so of a continued standing in the way of Christia∣nity from your infancy, untainted and undanted by temptation or tribulation, from within or from without, how plausible or how perillous soever they have appeared: constantly keeping the path that is called holy, by the line of Truth and Righteousnesse, as the fruits of that saving faith once given to the Saints (without rever∣sion)

which workes by love clear and sufficient evidence hereof, removing all grounds of suspi∣ion of private respects or vulgar ends; and who can discern aright the vertue, or attain unto the utility of such supplies of His gracious presence and providence but such as have seen and felt, ta∣sted and feasted upon the sweet and soul-ravish∣ing fruits of eternall, infinite and unchangeable love, wisdome, mercy, power and faithfulnesse of God in them? The sensible fruition, where∣of at some times unto the Saints, is like sweet oyntment powred out, and gives such fragrant smells, as sets the Virgins upon a Love-ardour and extasie in enquiring after Him when He seems ab∣sent, whom they have found altogether Lovely and only desirable, when in His Garden of Grace He hes been letting down the Dew of Heaven up∣on the spices of His own planting.
Here your Ladyship hes been nourisht, cherisht and refresht amongst your associats, flourisht and been fruitfull, and instrumentall to the com∣fort and encouragement of others, under the di∣versity of severall cases incident to these of your fellowship.
I have likewise, after your Ladyship, re∣membered the name of that famous and memo∣rable Matron, Marion Macknaught, whose me∣mory hes left a sweet smell behind her; and whose soul is now so over-joyed in Saviour-love, that she rests superexceedingly satisfied, atten∣ding the finall consummating of all things, subject to alteration, and the glory that is to be revealed: through which she hes been well guided and guar∣ded, and after whom, and others that be gone be∣fore, Your Ladyship is advancing through the windings and mazes of this labyrinth, the task and tryall of a Christian Believer, where is to be ob∣tained the greatest victories imaginable, and also, to be gained the richest treasures of all desirable excellencies attainable, only by the guiding of the holy Ghost, in holding fast the well twisted threed of sacred truth, whereby we make a sweet entry, a sure progresse, and a victorious retreat: whereas in letting this grip slip, we fall amongst Rocks & Robbers: and being bemisted amongst soul-murderers, head-notions, and heart-moti∣ons, perverting both wit and will unto unevit∣able and unrecoverable ruine, wirh the multi∣tude

who, slumbering in their sensualities, are swallowed up in the groundlesse gulf of endlesse oblivion, unlesse it please the Lord in an extraor∣dinary way to interpose, and wonderfully worke our rescue, thereby witnessing His unsearchable soveraignity in saving some (while others are suffered to sink in their own devices) who seeing themselves self-lost and so saved; they are bred unto self-denial, simple submission unto, and sole dependance upon their guide: with songs of joyfull deliverance from dangers past, with con∣fidence and courage for future supply.
All which, for recreation in spare houres, is of∣fered unto your Ladyship, not being prejudiciall to your more solemn and serious exercise, where∣in being daily sprinkled with the dew of grace, and throughly purified by the bloud of sprinkling, and so prepared for the places that be prepared for you: when corruption and all things corruptible being dissolved, glory and immortality put on, and you admitted (amongst others that stand by) to feast upon the superexcellencies of joyes that are in the King's face, and pleasures that be enjoyed at His right Hand for evermore, who

out of His eternall Love, in an incomprehensibl way of infinite wisdome hes purchased this peace, this grace, this glory to all the members of the body mysticall, whereof He the glorious Head, i the fulnesse of Him who filleth all in all: And unto whose grace and faithfulness, your Ladyship is fervently recommended, by,
Noble Madam,

Edinburgh,
Feb. 8. 1664.
