Right Honorable,
IT hath been the constant practice of the Adversary to oppose Truth, and to use his power to the dis∣couragement of Faithful Ministers and Professors thereof: Sometimes like an envious Phili∣stim, by casting dirt and earth into the Foun∣tain of living Waters, opened by the hard labors of godly men: Sometimes by casting out of his mouth water as a flood after the Wo∣man (the Church) that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood: Sometimes by supersemination of his pernitious Tares a∣mong the good Wheat in the Lords Field Hence were, and now are those multitudes

of Schisms and Errors, which in all ages of the Gospel, have infested the Church of Christ. In this last age, Satan knowing that his time is short, hath more furiously raged, moving all his engins, and using all his stra∣tagems, for his siege against the holy City, and Tents of the Saints. Amongst other his artifices, knowing how much innate ava∣rice inclineth vulgar mindes to sacriledge; he hath lately tempted many to endeavor the utter taking away of Tythes, the Ordi∣nance of God, as ancient as his Church on Earth; well-knowing, that by subtracting the Oyl from the Tabernacle Lamps, the light will soon go out, and the people must be left to a darkness, worse then Egyptian. This fearful condition was coming on us so pre∣cipitately, as that the enemies of Truth were not ashamed openly to boast, That within one years time, they would not leave either Church or Priest in England. But blessed be God who hath broken the jaw-bones of these ravenous Lions, and prevented their mischievous designs, by his gracious and marvellous providence, restoring his Sacred Majesty in peace unto his long

afflicted people, and them by Him to their just Laws and Liberties; and therewith the free exercise of the true Religion main∣tained by our former Princes of ever-blessed Memory. In which respect, though divers able Champions of Christ and his Church, have encountered the adversaries of these Church Rites, with such full abilities, as that they have left little to be added hereto, Quod non fit dictum prius. Yet seeing this con∣flict hath not so been ended, but that new enemies still gird themselves to the battle, it is necessary that they be invested and an∣swered: Therefore having brought to me from an adversary of all good, this piece which I endeavor to confute, as I conceive, by way of challenge; I could neither with credit to our Cause, nor good conscience to∣ward God, be silent, or leave the truth with∣out defence; my hope being, that I may hereby undeceive some who have misun∣derstood the case, which this adversary with his Jesuitical Arguments, so stingily and con∣tumeliously, laboreth in.
Why I presume to prefix your Honors Name to this homely Tract, none need de∣mand, who know the great favors which your Honor hath done for me; others I de∣sire to understand, that in point of gratitude, I humbly acknowledg the debt which I am no otherways able to pay, then by acknow∣ledgment, and my daily and hearty Prayers to Almighty God, abundantly to retribute for me, by his preserving your Honor, and all yours.
