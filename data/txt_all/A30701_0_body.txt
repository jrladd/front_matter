THE ensuing Discourse is most pro∣perly yours, being had upon that oc∣casion, wherein your selves and Relations are concerned so nearly; and therefore this Publick tender thereof is firstly made unto you: and that not in point of concernment only, as your interest, but of his duty too; by whom the tender's made: Who does ingeniously acknowledg as your Candor and kindness, and therein the many engagements laid upon him, so his readi∣ness to express a due sense thereof, in all things, on your account, wherein he's ca∣pable
of doing Service, or may testifie the sense of an obligation: And who in the mean while is an humble suppliant at the Throne of Grace, for the continued influ∣ence of all grace upon you and yours, in order to a prosperous well-being in this life, and everlasting happiness in the life to come.
