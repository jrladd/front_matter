GReat and gracious Lady, let
it not seeme strange (with
all humblenes I beseech it)
that an vnworthy souldier
shoulde offer lines to so
worthy a Lady: the dignity
of the subiect is it, that ar∣meth
with boldnes, for to whom doth more
properly belong the patronizing of those things
that are inciting to feminine vertue, then to your
Highnesse, in whom Modesty is seene to march
with Maiesty, Mildnes with Magnificence, Gratiousnes
with Greatnes, and where bright shining Vertue, is
an Attendant to waite vpon Dignity.
Of whom might I then make better choyce to
protect the worthines of women, then of her

that is the most worthy amongst women.
I assure my selfe that all vertuous women will
priuiledge mine indeuours, if any bee offended,
they are but such as are vnworthy to be pleased.
The warrant that I haue of your gracious dis∣position
doth more imbolden me, then the hope
that I haue of mine owne vntutered penne,
yet with all humblenes and duty, be∣queathing
my worthlesse lynes
to your worthy protection
will rest
