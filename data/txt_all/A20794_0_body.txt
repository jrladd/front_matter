THese two Sermons (right worshipfull Sir) after that once I was perswaded to haue them Printed, I thought to commend vnto you. That I may de∣dicate a diuinitie Sermō I am clear∣ly resolued: because S. Luke did de∣dicate his Gospell to Theophilus. The causes why I shoulde offer thē to you are these: First, many giftes worthye much commendations in your selfe: then that I was your seruaunt, and in deede it shall not but delight me to call you, and e∣steeme you as my Maister: then

that at all times you both haue deserued, and bene willing to de∣serue well of my studies. Of the Sermons I will say no one worde, they are Printed, and men haue eyes, God geue them iudgement: this one thing I must needes say, my health was very ill, both when I made these, and is yet still, it hath spoyled me of my Lecture at Paules, my being in the Citie, per∣aduentures, shortly of the countrey, and my life too: If God shall blesse me with better health, I would be glad (though most of all vnwor∣thy) to be some instrument for the kingdome of heauen: if not, it is not amisse, his blessed will be done. I wishe charitie from God to the worlde, peace at length to his war∣fayring Church, confusion of all

maner of hypocrites, fauourable in∣clination, and iudgement of great personages to his worde, and the godly traueilers in his gospell. Long life and most prosperous raigne to our loued Soueraigne Prince, and to all her subiectes that wishe the same, and all the electe of God, and euē with my whole hart I pray God the father, the God of heauen, and his Sonne our Lorde Iesus Christ, to holde strong the sweete lines of our predestination, to be a bright pillor to vs in the darke wil∣dernesse of this worlde, and to make all his chosen people at his time, parteners of a ioyfull and comforta∣ble resurrection.
Farewell.
