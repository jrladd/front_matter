I Have made it my bu∣siness ever since his Majesties most bles∣sed and Glorious Re∣stauration,
 to range our Proverbs, Proverbiall Metaphors and Drol∣ling Similies into a facile and ready Method for present search and per∣usal, when occasion should serve, beyond any Me∣thod yet extant. And accordingly to get the work into the Presse, I began by way of Sub∣scriptions, a Method Practised by several of my Betters, in Books of
