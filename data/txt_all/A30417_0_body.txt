My Lord,
THE Publishing this Sermon, was no easie part of
my Obedience, to your Lordships Commands, and
to the desires of the Court of Aldermen: for
I have no reason to expect it should be so favourably
received, when it is brought under the Eyes and Cen∣sures
of the World, as when it was first delivered. Since
the good temper the Auditory was in, upon the remem∣brance
of that great Conflagration, made it pass more
acceptably at first hearing, than is to be hoped for upon a

stricter review of it. And some Persons of high worth
and Eminence, have been of late, treated so unsutably,
either to their Merit, or their designs in what they
Preached, that it may justly give such a one as I am,
apprehensions of ill usage, for touching our sores, which
are so tender, that some cannot bear the handling them in
the softest manner.
But having observed that what I said on these
heads, was not unacceptable to your Lordship, who
are so great a Iudge; I do the more freely adventure on
making it publick. Since the Iustice, Prudence, and
Moderation of your Government, has given your Lord∣ship
so great an Interest in the esteem and affections, not
only of this great City, but of the whole Nation; that
as those who are to succeed you in that high Trust,
will be valued and loved, as they follow the Pattern
you have set them; so there are few things that can re∣commend
such a Discourse, more, than that I may, by
your Lordships permission, say, it was approved of by
one of so great an understanding, and so Excellent a
temper, as yours is generally known to be.
God grant this may have some good effect on those that
heard it, or may read it, and that the sad prospect now
before us, may by the mercy of God, upon our unfeign∣ed
Repentance, be changed unto a serene and happy

calm: wherein that your Lordship may be a great
Instrument, both in this City, and in the publick
Councels of the Kingdom, is the Earnest Pray∣er
of
My Lord,
