My Lord,
WHen I was told that this Book, as being useful to the publick, deserved to come abroad under such Auspices as might not only render it more accept∣able, but likewise of greater credit and reputation; I found my self directed by the voice of fame, the only means by which I have the honour to know your Lordship, to beg your Honours countenance and approbation to this Translation.
