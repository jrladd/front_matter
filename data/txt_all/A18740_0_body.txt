MOST gratious and sacred Soueraigne, if hope of your princely fauour did not car¦ry me beyond the compasse of my ordinary iudgement, I had long a goe surceased the common course of writing in verse to your Maiestie, But a sweete and comfortable conceite of your gracious goodnes towards me, euer and at all times commanded my muse, my pen, and vttermost power, to goe about no other earthly felicity then the ser∣uing and pleasing of the onely Phoenix of this world, my betters farre haue beene ful of that fortunate humor, and thriuen well thereby, & my selfe desires neuer to be discharged of that sweet seruitude, pleasāt to the mind, pro∣fitable to the body, and a safety for the soule. Now in this quenchles desire of mine that en¦creaseth a continuall thirst to doe well, there riseth a restles cogitation, making me think, that verse, that booke, or that peece of ser∣uice (as oft I haue put in practice) will be hap∣pely accepted, But beholding (most redoub∣ted Queene) a multitude of people as well de∣sposed

as my selfe, that are rūning & preasing apace before me, some with rare inuentions & some with deepe deuices to the honouring of your Maiestie. I feare they haue carried cleane away so much knowledge frōme, that ther is left no deuice, nor matter to study on, such is the bounty of our time, & forwardnes of their wittes which are learned, that all fine inuentions are smoothly reaped from my reach, & cunningly raked away from my vse or commoditie. Then am I forced, to search what substāce or slēder stuffe of poetrie lyes cowching in mine owne shallow head, and so hapning on a few voluntary rimes I haue as it were by good fortune, peeced or cōpounded vp a booke, which I cal a handful of gladsome verses, God graunt they be pleasing, but the best is they are deuised for a pastime, inuēted for a merry conceyt, and presented of a harm les mind, to the sweete and sacred considera∣tion of your Maiestie. Thus hoping they shal haue free passage to your princely presentes I pray humbly for the preservation of your most Royall person.
