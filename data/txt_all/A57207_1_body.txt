IT hath been reported by some, (who have had more vices in their mouths, than vertues in their mindes, that what Books I have printed formerly, were not mine owne; because (they have said) my countenance doth not promise so much. I could answer them, but I will not brawle with such poore blasts, for Solo∣mon saith, that which is done, hath been done, and there is no new thing under the Sun; there∣fore since my adversaries have not wit enough to rule like Judges on the Bench, I will let them braul like Prisoners at the Bar: I confesse Righteousness doth crosse the recreations of the rich, and Purity is against the opinion of the poore; Piety hath
been estranged from Princes, and Poetry is a my∣sterie to Pedlers, therefore my Poems are unfit for the Pockets of the one, or the Pallats of the o∣ther. Indeed though I have been perswaded by some eminent persons, yet I never did intend to write againe, till Providence gave me such an occasion to Pen my strange recovery from Death, which I have vowed to beare about me, as a perpetuall memoriall.
Thus from the secresies of night, have I stolne Time from sleep, to picture out from my vetired thoughts, the melancholy of my minde.
And Ladyes I present it to you.
It is a Maske of Cupid and Death; you can∣not run from the one, though you may raile at the other; and you will have no reason, for though the first part be fearfull, the last is delightfull, that if one cannot winne you, the other may wound you; let it lie in your laps, and at least be read by your lips, or hold it in your hands, till you have it in your hearts, that it may help to make you lovely with inward graces, when age and sicknesse with their ashy hands, have swept the beauty from your amorous eyes.
