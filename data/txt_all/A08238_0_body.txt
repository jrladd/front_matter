RIght Honourable, right Worthie, renowned Senat, and Pastors:
I Finding my selfe somewhat bound vnto your benevolent fa∣vours, therefore I in minde did decree to giue out the first fruits & proofe of my labours, vnder the tuition and de∣fence of your Honourable wisedomes; and seeing I found this briefe and compendious German worke to bee fit for my purpose, especially in those tymes when men are most secure, & sleeping in worldly vanities, I was in a manner incited, through consci∣ence

for to lay on my Talent, vnto the benefite of mine owne natiue Countrie, & beeing obliged, for to approue that which I did publickly professe, before your wor∣thie Senat, and within your renowned Ci∣tie. Therefore I could see none more meete to dedicate the proofe of my labours, as vnto the conspicuous & publicke censure of your Honourable Senat: Right Honou∣rable, the Author of this little worke is a German Doctor in divinitie to Han∣burgh, Doctor Philip. Nicolaj, now in the LORD, who appearantly hath beene graced, and indued with a gift of prophe∣cie, as experience and event of time, hath testified in his travels, & who is the right fundamentall ground of this worke and prophecie, written by him 33. yeares since, namely in the yeare of CHRIST 1596, which was found extant presently after him in Latine, and thereafter translated in the Germane tongue by Mr. Gothard Artus to Dassick, namely in the yeare of CHRIST 1598. whereout a Dence Professor called Niels Michelsone hath

gathered this briefe worke, and transla∣ted againe in Dence and Printed lately Anno 1628. The substance is a briefe a∣nalogie of times conferred with Scripture, out of Ezekiell, Daniel, and Revelation of Iohn, containing a Prophecie and suc∣cesse of the Ghospell to the worlds end, & concluded with the Authors protestation, which I thought good to translate, and ac∣companie with an exhortation to repen∣tance, and benefite mine owne Nation with the same. Heerewith persuading my selfe of acceptance, I doe thrust this poore myte of my travels into the treasurie of your Christian and charitable dispositi∣ons, recommending it vnto the protection and tuition of your Honourable wisdomes, and you and your doings vnto the grace of GOD.
