Gentlemen,
YOur voluntary undertaking this honourable
loyal Exercise of Armes, is in order to
render your selves thereby the more useful to your
King and Countrey.
That Government which preserves us (that it
may so do) must be inviolably preserved by us:
And certainly 'tis a great Debt and Duty which
we all owe to it.
'Twas long since the wonder of an ingenious
Platonist,Max. Tyri∣vs ,
&c. Speaking of Man, says he, Oh
God! the Creator of all things, what a strange,
temerarious, rash, unmanageable kind of Crea∣ture
is this which thou hast placed upon the earth!
We may resolve his Riddle, and answer as
Solomon,Eccl. 7. 29. God made man upright at first

But ever since the wretched Fall of our First Pa∣rents,
all manner of Distempers and ill humours
are like the Sons of Zerviah, too hard for us;
and even inherent in our corrupt Natures.
Experience shews us,Jam. 3. 7, 8. all other Creatures are
and have been tamed by Mankind; but (as
holy Scripture observes) we our selves remain
still in many things too unruly.
The All-wise God hath given us the har∣mony
of Government (as David's Harp in
Saul's Case) to charme this unquiet and evil
Spirit; That we might go the journey of life,
not as Savages but as Men. And (which is
far more) as the professed Servants of that God,
who is not the Author of confusion,1 Cor. 14. 33. but of
peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.
My Endeavours have been, inoffensively to
strengthen so Divine a Concern in this ensuing
Sermon. As your desires occasioned the compo∣sing
of it at first, and your importunities the
publishing of it at present; so You must now
please (such as it is) to accept of it from,

Gentlemen,  Bristol, May
10. 1680.
