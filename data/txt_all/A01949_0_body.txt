IT was a custome,
right worshipfull,
among the Hea∣thens,
when they
had trauailed the
Seaes, and escaped
the dāger, to sacrifice some part of
their treasure to that god, which
they iudged to be their deliuerer:
And sith it hath beene my fortune
to beare sayle in a storme, since my
first publishing the Schoole of Abuse,
and too bee tossed by such as
some without reason, and threa∣ten
me death without a cause, fee∣ling
not yet my finger ake, I can
not but acknowledge my safetie,
in your Worships patronage, and

offer you Phialo my chiefest Iuel,
as a manifest pledge of my thank∣full
heart. Notwithstanding if the
value answere not your expecta∣tion,
accept my good will, which
hold out my hand to doe my best:
little children, that drawe but a
hazel sticke, thinke they performe
as much as he, that shootes euerie
shaft in a bowe of steele. I confesse
that Phialo is too blūt for the court
if you iudge his conditions by his
coate, for the skinne of the Fox is
not comparable to the Leopard,
yet that is no signe that hee wan∣teth
witte. Though Phialo present
himselfe barely to your worships
viewe, when my skill wil not suf∣fer
me to poūce him out, yet such
as he is, I dare affirme, that cloth
and carkasse is at your commaun∣dement.
The pardon he craues is
for his simplicitie, which hath

beene somewhat homely brought
vp like a rude Macedon, and taught
too call a spade, a spade without
any glosing. Wherein I iudge
him the more to be esteemed, bi∣cause
he vseth no going about the
bushe, but treades Dunstable waye
in all his trauell. For such as haue
tried the conclusion, knowe, that
he which baiteth his hookes with
medicinable drugges, catcheth the
greatest store of fishe; yet are they
not toothesome, nor good to bee
brought vnto the table: And hee
that tempers his speeche with art,
smootheth his style wi a double
tongue, shall quickly haue infinite
swarmes of freendes, but angle
with poyson, and doe much hurt.
The Daies works of Phialo, which
spendeth his time in profitable di∣sputation
among his freendes, I
haue called his Ephemerides, after

the maner of the Greekes; hum∣bly
requesting your worship to
vouchsafe them the reading, bi∣cause
you are learned; & to yelde
them your patronage, sith they
carie some taste of the Vniuersitie.
