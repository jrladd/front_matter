My Lord,
AS a testimony of my Gratitude, for those many Favours I have received from your Lordship, I humbly present this small Book of my deceased Bro∣thers, of Planting. I confesse it un∣worthy

your Honours perusal, who are as great a Judge of Books as Men: yet I intreat your Lordships Patronage and Countenance, pre∣suming it may be serviceable for the preserving, and perfecting your new Orchard at Brackly, and so somewhat prevail towards the pro∣curing your Honours pardon, for prefixing so great a Name before so mean a Discourse. My Lord, I lay it at your Feet, and assure your Lordship, it comes from one who honours you in the most secret cor∣ners of his Heart, and who had no other way, nor method to express it but this. I know your Lordships Charity to be so diffusive, as to in∣vite

all those, who have the honour to know you, to make their applica∣tion to it: and that you are readier to afford your protection to those that want it, then they are to crave it, and will not I humbly conceive, be offended at this Dedication, knowing the weakest, and meanest ever seek their support from the Great, and Good. And that is ano∣ther Reason of the present Ambi∣tion of (My Lord)
