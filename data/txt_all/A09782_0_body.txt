RIght Honorable, hauing hap∣pened (of late) vpon this Dis∣course, no lesse pleasant to be read, then profitable to be practized; and considering how vnwor∣thy a part it were, to send so worthy a worke, vnto the view of the world, both namelesse, and frendlesse; I bethought my selfe of some Mecaenas, that should vn∣dertake the defence of it against the ra∣ging stormes of carping Momistes: At last, I resolued vpon your Honour, whom
pietie and Iustice hath made famous and renowmed amongst all men. Wherefore I now humbly present the same vnto your good Lo. to be intertayned, as you shall find it worthy. In the meane time, com∣mending both it and my selfe vnto your honourable protection, I commit t your honor to the tuition of the Almighty.
