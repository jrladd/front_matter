SIR,
IN the lowliest posture of Humility these Historicall Examples, ex∣tracted out of the choicest Au∣thors both Ancient and Moderne by two learned Doctors, are pre∣sented to Your Highnesse; Nei∣ther would they presume to put themselves under so high a Patronage, did I not humbly conceive, that being Historicall Peeces, they might be fit for Your Highnesse perusall, History being the proper'st and most advantagious Study that Princes can ap∣ply themselves unto, because it containes examples of all sorts; In History Brave men stand as Mar∣ble Statues erected in the Temple of Immortality, and Bad men as Malefactors upon Gibbets, ex∣pos'd to the publick view of the world to all Poste∣rity. Although Your Highnesse hath a Royall Father for an incomparable living Patterne of all the

Cardinall Vertues with their Attendants, (which breaking through these late Clouds of Civill Confu∣sions) shin'd with an advantage of lustre to the won∣derment of the world) as also against any thing that may have the least vicinity with Vice, to imitate, yet, humbly under favour, variety of Examples, as of Witnesses in Law, cannot doe amisse, the one for confirmation of Truth, the other for di∣rection of Life; In which opinion I rest,
