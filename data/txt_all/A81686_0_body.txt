To the most Vertuous, most Pious, and most charitable Ladies, the Relievers of poor Prisoners, during the late Troublesome times, for Religion.
NOthing appears more Splendent in this World, then the Heroick Actions of Men, by which they Conquor Nations, Destroy their Enemies, and consequently, free themselves from Sla∣very and Thraldome, becoming thereby, not onely an everlasting Glory to Poste∣rity, but also to the Countries and Na∣tions from whence they descend.
All those, most Vertuous, most Pious, and most Charitable Ladies, you have far surpass'd by your unparallel'd Good∣ness, Piety, and Liberality. Alexander, the Great Conqueror of the World, has
 own'd the same, saying, That who o∣vercomes himself, is more Praise Worthy, then he who takes by force of Armes the strongest Townes or Cities.
It is known to those that have Tra∣velled most parts of Europe, that none has practised all the degrees of Vertue more than you these three Years last past; and this is to overcome ones self. You boar your Crosses chearfully; you thanked God as well in your Adversi∣ties, as in your Prosperities; you suc∣coured your distressed Neighbours; you Comforted the Comfortless; you Visited the Sick; and you did not abhor the noisome Smells of Goals, but afforded your Almes as showers of Gold to poor Prisoners; and the Dead you Buried with Joy: These are the Works of Mercy, recommended by our Saviour Jesus Christ, the which acquir'd unto you more Honour and Glory, then ever Conquerors deserv'd; for what doth it avail one, to gain the whole World,
 with the loss of his Soul? By these good Acts, your Memories ever remain, both in this, and in the World to come. By these you are a Mirrour to future Ages, and which is more, you have by these prepared to your selves an everlasting habitation with God and his Angels in Heaven: For as Water quenches Fire, so your Almes and good Deeds have ex∣tirpated the Root of your Sins. Now you will find verified the words of Christ, That what you have done for one of these little ones in Prison, you have done it for Him. All this while 'tis to be believ'd, that all these forementio∣ned great and ample works of Piety, has been grounded on true Charity, which is understood to be done for Gods sake alone; For what is practised on other respects, as for kindred, friendship, or for any other worldly Interest sake, or out of a natural pity, carries its whole reward of good Name or Fame along with it. For my part, I am fully per∣swaded, your Intentions in bestowing
 your Charities, are sincere and real, for the Love of God only; as a certain Wid∣dow I knew, who had but an hundred pounds per annum Joynture, gave forty thereof to Relieve poor Prisoners. Pray give me leave to tell you, that your will and pleasure in the distribution of your Charities, is much abused; You have one end therein, and some of your Ser∣vants or Trustees another; You intend doubtless, that your Charities be divi∣ded to the Honour and Glory of God, according to the Prisoners necessities and Qualities; But on the contrary, your Trustees, resolves to give the same to those they love and fancy most, but whether that be well or ill grounded, God and their own Conscience must be Judge. There are some detained Prisoners for want of Monys to procure their Habeas Corpus, and to pay their Chamber Rent: but you had rather contribute so much a week for the Release of such Prisoners, then allow them a maintenance in Prison; but your Trustees wholly reject such pro∣posalls,
 by which they hinder the Pri∣soners Liberty, and put you to unneces∣sary charges for their Maintenance: One or two of them gave your Moneys freely to discharge the expences requi∣site for the Release of a Stranger they had a kindness for; and another at the same time and place, and on the same account, although well known to most Catholicks in Town, could not prevail to have a penny from them. Happy is he in these dayes, that is young and handsome, which some of your Trustees regard more than the fulfilling of your pleasures; yet to justifie themselves in their Extravagancies, must needs al∣leadge some unjust reasons for what they do, to the great disparagement and dammage of the Prisoners, whose griev∣ances (and what else they can say for themselves) cannot be heard, so that they are often censur'd, even by their best Friends, though without any just Cause, or the least shaddow of Truth, contrary to the precepts of true Charity.

Now, least by somes neglect in a work you undertook so grateful to God, you should loose any part of your expected Reward from him, I thought it worth my labour, and your knowledge, to give you a particular account of some passages concerning certain Prisoners, and the mannagers of your Charities. Men and Women while they live in this world have their failings, and where you find either of them to transgress, be pleased in your accustomed Bounty, to be im∣partial in your Judgments, and let right take place: If you Judge charitably, (as I hope you will) and commiserate their weakness, God will deal with you accordingly, and your works will shine on Earth, as it doth in Heaven: In both which places, wishes you and yours from his heart, the greatest Joy and Comfort that can be.
Most Vertuous and Pious Ladies,
