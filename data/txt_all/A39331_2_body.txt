Honour'd SIRS, and my much endeared Friends:
IT is not my lowest happiness, nor my meanest Honor, that one and the same Climate owns our Nativities, one and the same City allow'd our Freedoms, one and the same Society honours our Employment, and I hope one and the same affection shall ever unite our Relations. When I cast up the revolution of time wherein we have exercised together, and for so many yeares contemplate your free and forward choise to honour me in the primary places of Directi∣on and Discipline, but more especially that remarkable honour of your re∣spect and favour, in the unanimous Election of me to be your Commander in Chief, upon one of your grand and publike Days of your drawing forth into the Champaigne, where your severall Exercises were the sole Object of that Days admiration, and the subject of future Times applause. I must of necessity conclude my self your Debtor, beyond the hope of satisfaction.

My earnest desires are, that your Resolves, and Exercises in this Art, may never be retarded, but heightned to that glorious pitch, that you may be able to send forth knowing Souldiers for all honorable and lawfull En∣gagements of war, whether Forreign or Domestick. Towards which I hum∣bly offer here my talent, which comes unto you as the latest Emissary from the honorable Militia, to whom it hath but now prostrated it's service; and the best Orator of my grateful acknowledgment of your many and undeser∣ved favours towards me, for which I shall, in the most inviolable bonds of friendship, ever expresse my self
