SIRS,
I Here present you with some Reflections upon the Arch-Bishop of York's Farewel-Sermon, which his Grace tells us he Published at your Request: They are written in form of Letter to him; and as I present them to you with as much Respect, and in as much Christian Charity, as he, I believe, presented the Sermon; so I hope you will read them with as much Candour, and examine impartially, without any byass to Persons or Causes, which is in the Right, and whether the Things which you took upon his Grace's Authority, be so or no. I must do him the Justice to acknow∣ledge, That he is an eminent Person in his Profession, as well as in that station which he now holds in the Church, and that he deserves that Esteem and Veneration which you have for him: But then I must tell you, That the Authority of no single Man, or number of Men, how eminent or great soever, ought to signifie any thing with Church of England Men, against the Authority of the Church. I have seen her Articles and Homilies in many of the London-Vestries; and if they be in yours, I desire you to make them the Test of my Lord's Sermon, and this Answer to it, which I desire may be approved, or rejected by you, as it happens to prove by that Test.
See, I pray you, Gentlemen, if you can find any thing in them to coun∣tenance transferring Allegiance from a living and claiming Legal King, or daily Praying for his destruction: See if you can find any thing in them that will justifie his Graces Exposition of 1 Tim. 11.1, 2. or of Submitting, or Praying for the Powers in being, without distinction or regard to Titles, which he says, Is the very Doctrine of the Church of England.Pag. 3. If it be, you may surely easily find it; but if you cannot find it, or any thing like it, then you may be sure it is not the the Doctrine of the Church, though it may be the Doctrine Preach'd of late in the Churches, and then you will have occasion to follow the Apostle's advice, which is, not to have the Per∣sons of Men in Admiration, and to remember what our Lord often incul∣cated
to his Disciples, to beware whom, and how they heard. There are some times in which his advice is more needful than others; and this, I think, is such a time, when our Church-men are divided in their Practice, and a∣bout some practical Points; and whether the greater or smaller number is in the Right, you will never be able judge, though it concerns your Souls to judge aright, unless you will hear what both say.
There are Men of equal Eminence and Learning on both sides, and if one side can pretend the Advantage Numbers, the other can urge against it the interest of saving, and getting more, to depretiate the Number and Authority of their Examples, together with a multiform variety of most different Opinions, and Principles among them; one of them complying in one sense, and upon one Principle, and another upon another.
This Book of mine is a short and summary Apology for the little suffer∣ing Number, against the Arguments and Accusations of the Arch-Bishop, who is now at the head of the other Party; and if it can prevail with you to look more narrowly into the Controversie, in which you have enga∣ged his Grace, I shall think my self sufficiently recompenced for my little Pains in Writing of it; and in Hopes that you, or some of you, who have most leisure and ingenuity, will do so, I Subscribe in all Sincerity,
Gentlemen,
