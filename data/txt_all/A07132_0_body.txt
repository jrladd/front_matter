FORASMVCH, as the ROMAN MAR∣TYROLOGE is tran∣slated, and publi∣shed in diuers o∣ther vulgar Languages; it hath byn thought conuenient, that our English Nation also, should be no longer depriued of vvhat others haue already inioyed, to their great Profit: who by hea∣ring

the dayly Memory of so ma∣ny and eminent SAINTS read, & renewed, haue made thereby, no small progresse, in the spiri∣tuall affayres of their soule.
And hauing taken vpon me the publishing heereof, for the Comfort of many, who haue long wished, and desired to see it in print; I resolued by way of Dedi∣cation, to commēd the same vn∣to You, the CATHOLIKES of my Countrey; not doubting but you will receaue it with as grate∣full an Acceptance, as my Good-VVill, and poore Endeauours haue byn alwayes ready, to attend on You, in such like Occasions.
The VVorke, is so much the more proper vnto You, by how

much it setteth forth briefly the Sanctity and Prayse of those Ho∣ly WORTHIES, who in former tymes haue vndergone the like Persecutions, for the selfe-same FAITH & RELIGION, which You endure at this present, in our Countrey. And as they were most famous, throgh the World, for their Constancy and Zeale, in suffering for Christ, Losse of Goods, yea and of Life it selfe: so I trust, You shall also be renowned in future Ages, for the Pressures you now sustayne, in, and for the same Cause, both before God and Man.
The Translatour heerof, hath exactly followed the last, & most corrected Edition, and by com∣paring

diuers Translatiōs togea∣ther, hath endeauored, faythful∣ly to expresse the true, and ge∣nuine sense of the Authenticall ROMAN Copy; therby to giue as much satisfaction to the Rea∣der, as possibly he could, aswell in the proper Names of Places, as Persons, which are not so obuious to euery one, that is not acquain∣ted with forrayne Countreyes, nor with the vulgar denomina∣tions therof in other languages.
For my owne part, I acknow∣ledge, that although my Labour heerin hath not byn very great; yet my Desyre to profit my Coū∣trey, by publishing the same, hath not byn perhaps the least: since the Trāslatour being many

yeares agoe departed this Life, I haue byn carefull to finish some things therof, not fully ended at his death; and to recommend to the cōmon View, what so deare a Friend, as he was, intended, if God had pleased to haue giuen him longer dayes.
I had once a determination, to haue adioyned vnto euery Day, in a word or two, the Saints of our owne Nation, as the Tran∣slatours into French, Dutch, and Flemish haue done those of their Countryes: But, because I did some yeares ago publish an En∣glish Martyrologe of the said Saints, and which shortly I also intend to reprint, with some Additions and Change, I hold it needlesse


to adde any thing els heerunto at this presēt, to auoyd prolixity.
And if I shall vnderstand, that these my poore paynes, may be gratefull vnto You; I will endea∣uour to expresse the same heer∣after, in some other thing of bet∣ter Moment, that may tend al∣so, to the greater aduancement of your spirituall Comfort and Consolation: And shalbe euer, most ready to remayne,
