O Reuerend Rois, and maist redowtit Roy
O peirles Prince, and Per uperlatiue
Our hope, our helth, our help, and warldlie Ioy
Comfort to Scotland Indefinitiue:
Cleir lamp of licht aboue all that dois liue
Patrone of prudence, precious and perfite,
Gem of Ingine, to quhome God lykis to giue
Gracis far ma, nor I can think or write.


¶ Thocht ouir all quhair thy famous louing springis
In reputatioun and greit reuerence,
Thocht thy renoun out throch al Europe ringis
As flowand fountane full of sapience
To offer this ʒit to thine Excellence
For feir of fault I wald haue bene effrapit
Git I had not be sure experience
Thy gracious gudenes prouin and assayit.


¶ For this respect, maist cūning courtes King,
As I desire, and wischis eirnestlie
To pleis and serue ʒour grace in euerie thing
Swa I beseik ʒour mightie Maiestie
For to accept this mater maid be me
To glaid ʒour grace, conforme to Innentioun
Of Clerkis commending, mirth with honestie
As Comedeis, and sie vther Inuentioun.


¶ Schir reid thairfoir, and mak me to reiois
I hecht ʒour hienes, helping Goddis grace
That I sall pen sum Poetrie or prois
Mair profitabill, gif I get time and space
And sen ʒour wit all vertewis dois Imbrace
Schortlie I sweir, bot gif ʒour grace allow it,
That I sall curs my cairfull catiue care,
Sine quite this quair, and neuer sall awow it.



¶ To tak this peice in proper patronage
Ʒour Prencelie prudence will me not deny
Than gif thay speir, the Author to alledge
Quha wrait the veirs, I sall say it was I
And sall not sussie men geuin to Inuy
Bot quhen thay lak, or lauchis at my letter
Bauldlie sall say in geuing the defy
Vpon the subiect. se quha can do better.

¶FINIS.
