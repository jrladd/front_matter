SIR,
WHen Poets dedicate to Great Men, their
servile Genius stoops to Flattery: They
write not their just sentiments, but what they
think will please their Patrons: So, to make them
great, they debase themselves, and become Ido∣laters
of Images, gilded by their own praise. As
well may the Carver adore his Statues, the Painter
his Pictures, which are their own handyworks.
To shew my dislike of this Custom, I chose to
expose this Tragedy to the publick with no other
ornament than your name. But let not the world
mistake me; for you have Virtues that render you
more valuable than Titles. They that know you
love you, for you will not let the least of your ac∣quaintance

go unobliged whenever you can find
opportunity to show your generous temper. Be∣lieve
me, Sir, I esteem your friendship, and the
name of Friend is preferrable to any title that de∣scends
by Birth, or what Monarchs can confer; the
first comes without desert, the latter oftner by Chance
than Merit. Let other Poets then boast Patrons
of Quality, whilst I, more happy I, enjoy my Friend,
I am my Friend and my Friend is Me. Oh he is
absent yet, but when he comes, the chearful Bot∣tle
shall tune our souls to as high a rapture, as if
we were met at the Harmonions Feast of Great
Cecilia. Haste then, thou worthy man, and chear
the hearts of all your Friends. None in your ab∣sence
more devoutly wishes your return, than
SIR,
Your Friend and Servant,
