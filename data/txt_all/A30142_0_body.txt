My Noble Lord!
IN all Ages, discerning and
serious Men, who knew best
to allow and distinguish things
and Persons, have made it their
great Complaint, That the pre∣sent
Generation did degenerat

from the former; And that
the Generality of Men were
too apt and ready to pursue
bad Courses: And some think∣ing
Persons now, are easily in∣duced
to believe, that, the Days
we live in, the World is not
much mended. This notwith∣standing,
no Time hath been
known (how dissolut soever)
wherein some worthy & ver∣tuous
Men have not appear∣ed,
who have studied to im∣prove
Natural and Moral En∣duements,
and to pursue Ver∣tue,
preferring that way to base

Interest, and selfish Ends. And
it is well known, that even at
this Time, when many & great
Duties are easily superceded,
there are here and there some
Persons who worthily act up∣on
the Principles of Honour,
Conscience, and Vertue, mau∣gre
all Discouragements. A∣mong
whom Your Lordship
(even in your Solitude) moves
and acts in a very high and
conspicuous Sphere, to that
Measure of lovely Vertue and
Splendor, that Your Friends
and Wellwishers admire, and

your Enemies (if You have
any) can find no matter of
Censure. If there were many
such in the Nation, it would
be no hard mater to retrieve &
bring in Vogue again, these ad∣equat
Qualities and Vertues,
which often have rendered ma∣ny
of our Countrymen (en∣dued
therewith) famous and
illustrious both at Home and
Abroad. In the mean Time
it is to be wish'd that each
man would labour to reform
Himself and his own Ways,
conforming them to these ex∣cellent

Rules. And that cer∣tainly
at length would make
and advance a laudable Re∣formation
indeed. But it is
to be feared, that this would
rather prove an abortive Wish,
than that it shall have its wisht
for Effect: albeit (to have it
so with the World) it should
be a part of our dayly Prayers,
and come in continually to
Our Letany.
My Lord!
Whilst You are Enjoying
Your self, and are solaced
with the Comfort of a good

Conscience, in Your Retire∣ment,
making your self an Ex∣ample
of Vertue, and a Pat∣ern
of Honour and Goodness
to those who observe you and
your Actions. I humbly ad∣dress
Your Lordship, not de∣siring
to interrupt Your Re∣pose,
but to afford You a litle
divertisement for some of your
vacant and Recreating Minuts:
By Offering to Your Lordships
Perusal these following Sheets,
and Begging Your Patronage
thereto: And I judge I have
little Reason to despair of your

Favour and Acceptance, since
Your Lordship was Pleased to
shew a more than Ordinary
Affection and Kindness to the
Author my Father. And there∣fore
I hope this little Tract wil
give Your Lordship some Con∣tent;
and for others I am bold
to say, I hope well: for many
Persons of great Honour and
Judgement, have (since my
Father the Authour's Death)
been sollicitous to get written
Copies from the Original, which
was indeed perfected by My
Father in his Own Time,

without any Design to make
it publick. But my Father's
M. S. with all his Books be∣ing
committed to a certain
Person he, without my Privity,
gave out Copies to Knowing &
Inquisitive Persons, as of late
I came to understand, and now
these Copies abounding abroad,
and most (if not all) being
defective or incorrect, (to
Prevent my Father's being
abused) I now send a True
Copy abroad unto the World,
and let it See the Light: And
go it must under your Lord∣ships

Patronage, for I am con∣fident
the Design will succeed
the better, and the Book will
be the more acceptable to
these who Love and Desire
the Knowledge of such curious
Maters: Nor shal I diffide its
Fate, being first wellcome to
Your Lordship, to whom I
hereby address the same, most
humbly and heartily, and not
in course, ingyring upon a
Patron, as the custom some∣times
is.

Thus, begging Your Lord∣ships
Pardon for my Presump∣tion,
I do intreat from your
Lordship the Honour to be ac∣counted,
My Noble LORD,
