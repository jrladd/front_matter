SJr, like Parrhasius, J haue thought it meete
To draw the worke, J wrought on, in a sheet:
If your quicke eye discerne vnhandsome feature,
Where 'twas my part to limne a comely creature:
Daigne to beleeue (my Lo.) my hand did shake,
Because much sorrow made my heart to ake.
Be then your gracious patience as the vaile
To couer that, wherein my skill did faile.
