My Lord,
THE glorious Post You are
in possession of, and where∣unto
the judicious Choice of the
Greatest and Wisest of Kings,
as well as a most ripen'd Capaci∣ty,
hath advanced▪ You to, doth

so naturally appropriate this Rela∣tion
unto Your Self, that I cou'd
not forbear, how shapeless soever
the same may be, to present it to
Your Honour: I had no other
Design in the first Undertaking,
than to compile it for my own
particular Instruction: But the Si∣lence
of all those who made the
Voyage with me, constrained me
to expose it to publick View.
Your Lordship can find nothing
here, which the Extent of Your
Knowledge hath not already anti∣cipated;
for what can such a Mini∣ster
be ignorant of, who for the
Revolution of so many Years, and
in such hazardous Times, hath su∣stain'd
the Weight of Publick Af∣fairs
in the most potent Monarchy
of the World, and whose Extra∣ction
is from a Family wherein
Science and Illustrious Qualities are
as Hereditary as Nobleness of Birth,

and Integrity of Life? Wherefore,
My Lord, I have been so far from
thinking to offer any thing New
to Your Honour upon this Occasi∣on,
that I have had no no other
Intention, than barely to make
known the ardent Desire I have to
be in a Condition to merit Your
Protection by a continual Applica∣tion
of my self to my Duty, and
an Inviolable Adherence to Your
Lordship's Will, who am with pro∣foundest
Respect,
My Lord,
