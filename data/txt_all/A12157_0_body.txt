SIr, your candide censure of some vnwor∣thy Poems which I haue presented to the world, long since made me your Seruant in my thoughts, and being vnwilling to rest long in the silent contemplation of your Noblenesse, I presumed at last to send this Comedy, to kisse your hand, as the first degree to my greater happinesse in your more particular knowledge of me; It wanted no grace on the Stage, if it appeare accep∣table to you in this new trimme of the Presse, it will im∣prooue abroad, and you oblige the Author to acknowledge a fauour beyond the first applause. Pardon the rudenesse of my publike addresse to you, in the number of many whom which more excuse, I might haue interrupted. I am bold, but your mercy will incline you not to despise these (at the worst) but errors of my devotion, and the weak expression of his seruice, whose desires are to be knowne,
