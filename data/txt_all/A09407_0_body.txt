WEL knowen
is it vnto you both,
Right reuerende and
learned doctors how
carefully our good
friende M. Hugh Morgan her Ma∣iesties
Apothecarie, hath euermore
imployed himselfe and his purse to
furnish this Realme with the rarest,
perfectest and best sortes of all ma∣ner
of Plants, Fruits, Iuyces, Gumes,
Mettals, Mynerals, Boales, Stoanes,
and whatsoeuer else needfull: For



the either preseruing or restoring of
health. Whereby he hath not onely
well deserued of his Countrie at
home. But is also become famous
for sundrie his compounds, special∣ly
for his exact Composition of his
Mythridat, and his Tyracle of An∣dromachus:
throughout France and
Italie and manie places further off.
It pleased him (I thanke him) of late
to send vnto me a new Terra Sigil∣lata,
latelie found out in Germanie:
which hath not onely beene tryed
by the Phisitions of those partes to
be most souereigne against all poy∣sons
and sundrie deadlie diseases:
but hath also in the like cases been
here wel experienced by my good
& learned friend M. Doctor Hector,
Nunnes and diuerse others of your
learned Colledge in London, who
hath found it most effectuall in sun∣drie
dreadfull and daungerous di∣seases.
He sent me withall a little
booke in latine written by Andre∣as
Bertholdus touching the vertues



and the right vse thereof, which I
thought good for the benefite of
such as bee ignorant in that tongue
to put in english and to publish it
vnder your learned protection.
Accept it I beseech you and vouch∣safe
it your fauorable countnance.
Aluingham this 14. of August.
1587.
