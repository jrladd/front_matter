May it please your Lordship,
COuld I as truly boast I had perform∣ed
your Commands in making Ap∣pian
English, as I can that I at∣tempted
it by your Command, I
should with much more confidence
(than now I dare) present it to your Lordship: for
the least flattering imagination that I were able to make

this excellent Historian speak as well, and prove as plea∣sing
to yor Lordship in ours, as he does in any other
foreign Language, would be apt to create in me a confi∣dence,
pardonable only in those who are successful in their
obedience, and whose Performances are equal to their
Wishes.
But since the knowledge of my own weakness forbids
me to entertain any such thoughts, I come with all hu∣mility
to lay at your Lordships feet not the effects of my
well doing, but of my good will; and though I am suffi∣ciently
sensible of my want of power to give height to my
desires; yet I rest satisfied in this, that Experience hath
taught me, your Lordship can never want goodness to ac∣cept
of my intentions. And whilst you have so much of
that Heaven about you, I can fear little damage from a∣ny
Earthly Defects of mine.
And whilst your Lordship is pleased to own Appian,
and undertake his protection in this Humble Dress of mine,
what doubt can I harbour of his finding a happy Reception
in the World? You, who have been so great an
Example of the main subject he treats of, Military Prow∣ess;
You, who have so seasonably pressed your self forward,

both in Naval and Land Service for the Glory of your
King and Country, that no Example of Roman Bravery
could ever reach to; You, whom if Appian himself were
still alive, he would be proud of the opportunity of ex∣ceeding
all he has done (in one of his greatest Excellen∣cies)
by giving a Character of so illustrious a Worthy.
For I dare leave it to any impartial Reader of this Age to
judge, whether any of his Descriptions of those Hero's, whose
Actions he writes, comes not short in many points of what
justly might be said of your Lordship, or if any there be (sure
I am) none but the two great Scipios can pretend to claim a∣ny
Parallel. You like them have uninteressed fought for
your Country; and in this have exceeded them, that
when your Glory was already at that height made you the
envy of ill men, you still thrust your self into those ha∣zards
makes you the Admiration of all that have either
Goodness or Honour, which together with your other ex∣cellent
Qualities deservedly entitles you to that Attribute
once given to the Emperour Titus, of being, The De∣light
of all Humane Kind.
But why should I strive to tell the World what they al∣ready
know, and what none will dispute with me▪ 'Tis an

Honour too great for me, that your Lordship has by laying
this Command upon me, given me an occasion to publish the
hearty desire I have to acknowledge all your Lordships Fa∣vours,
and to assume a liberty (few men living but would be
proud to share in) of declaring my self,
My Lord,
