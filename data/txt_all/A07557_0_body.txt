MOST mightie Monarch.
In the infancie of the precious bloo∣ming Church, planted by the perfection of beauty vpon the earth, Lucifer in his instruments roared against it: Christianos ad leonem: non licet esse Christi∣anos. In the reigne of Queene Mary, the haire then being growne as white as the bloome of the Almonde tree; Christianos ad ignem: non li∣cet esse Christianos. In the reigne of Queene Eli∣zabeth, when either Lyon nor Fire terified Gods children, he hastened to Rome, snt away
 Perillus brasen Bull, to see if any Phalaris would, or could torment Gods children therein. But when none of power could be found, he (knowing that the Children of the Church plaied stil about the mouth of the Bull, as vpon the hole of the Aspe) poasted from Rome to this little Paradise; to try if he could by speaking to your Maiestie in Popish bookes, and peti∣tions, procure your Grace to the Churches sub∣uersion, to eate of the forbidden fruite. But herein likewise failing, he mustereth vp Cay∣phas knights, that they might besiege the Church by compassing the tents of the Saints about, and the beloued citty (inhabiting as a glorious Mo∣narch, liuing vnder your gracious and royall re∣giment) in the Parliament house; to the end shee might (as the Chariot of Light, there imployed to Gods glory) be ouerturned by those Phaë∣tons, hs instrumentall surtes: in whom he euer∣more roareth Nemo nostrûm frugesto. But see∣ing (right royall Soueraigne) the all-seeing Deity (that made them cry, Deus venit in castra, vae nois) hath preuented the same, to the gi∣uing of vs you Maiesty as a King not amongst vs before; once more in all humilitie, as vpon a second Coronation, I do present vnto your Highnesse, these liuely Oppositions, shewing the diffrence betweene the truth preached by
 the Lords Ambassadours: and the falshood by Po∣pish instruments, which Gentlemen, vnworthy of that stile, would with so much bloud set vp. Thus crauing pardon of your gracious Clmencie for my boldnesse herein, In all humility, pray∣ing to God to blesse your Maiestie, your vertu∣ous Queene, and royall progeny, with the glorious beatitude of this life, and the blisse of eternity; I humbly take my leaue,
