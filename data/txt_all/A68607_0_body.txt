AS one not ambitious, but desirous to set foorth the glory of God, to declare his truth and publish his mercies, I haue pre∣sumed to present this small Treatise to your viewe, wherein is handled the shortnesse and fewnesse of mans dayes, the frailtie and vncertaintie thereof, how he is mortall, euery day dying, because euery day life shortneth, & the rather be∣cause it was preached at the Funerall of your deare Father. I knowe Salomon findeth fault with writing many bookes, saying, there is no end in writing many bookes, but Eccles. 12. 12, Tenet insanabile multos scribends cacoethes. they are such doe defend false doctrine, and vaine opini∣ons which he taxeth, such as set foorth the glory of God he commendeth. This inconsiderate age of ours, is more wil∣ling to entertaine idle Pamphlets & vaine toyes, with fond

inuentions haue excogitated, then to embrace such laudable enterprises which further the kingdome of God, or perswade the truth of Religion among the sonnes of men. I knowe some will not spare to barke at this, but I will passe by the Sllean dogges. and stop my eares, as Ierome speakes, e∣steming  Zoilus, nothing at all, nor much regarding  as carpe at each monument of pietie, and in a prejudi∣e  reiect and discharge their paines who shall  crosse the watch of their wicked delights. I doubt not  with you and with all good Christians it will finde ac∣ceptance.) It is vnworthy the worlds view, being the fruits of a short conception, the effect of a distracted study, oft hindered and perturbed by sinister courses. Thus thanke∣fully remembring my selfe, doe commend your wayes to the Lord, that they may be prosperous, your sorrowes easie, your comforts many, your vertues eminent, your consciences quiet, your liues holy, your deaths comfortable, your election sure, and your saluation certaine, remaining.
