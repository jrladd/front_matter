SIR,
O Restes, upon his arrival from Greece, is drawn by sympathy to take up his station with so good a Friend as you are. He could per∣haps have made a choice that the world would have esteem'd more preferable and more illustrious. But, he judges not as the world judges. The Title of Friend is to him more atractive than a∣ny in the Court of Honour; nay, he esteems it too more glorious. Virtue, Good Sense and Greatness of mind are requir'd to make a Friend; and where-ever he meets with those qualities he finds true Nobility. In you, indeed, he makes

choice of a Person who derives no glori∣ous Title from his Father, but who inhe∣rits from him the truest Honour, that of an unblemish'd Character, the Character of an upright frank, understanding, sincere man. One who has greatness of mind enough to know that he was not born for himself, and who loves Mankind, the noble com∣munity, of which he was made a member. One who is constantly true to himself, and constantly just to others, and always easie both to himself and others, agreea∣ble to Strangers, dear to his Friends, and good to his very Enemies. As such he visits you, assur'd before-hand of his kind Reception, tho more upon the ac∣count of his generous friendship, than any other merit he brings. I am,
SIR,
