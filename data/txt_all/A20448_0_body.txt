RIght Honourable branches of a fayre and spreading faily, vnder whose shades my best fortunes ruminate, I haue thought good to vnite you all in a whole peece, whom en∣uious time cannot make marchandise in parcels. (to conioyne you:) which to disioyne, were a sinne as deepe as a Lawyers pate in Terme time, that sings no song but De profundis. I honour that musicall consent of frater∣nity, and hold it not inferiour to Pithagoras his harmony: let this modicum of superfluous minutes craue but the pri∣uiledge of a Seruingman, and weare the cloth of your fa∣uour. Semel in anno ridet Apollo: Serious houres and graue designes must needes laugh, and amongst them, my studyes at this time, are turned merry Greeke. I writ them in Dog dayes, and they must needes bite: but what? not vertue, not honor, not nobility: but error, ignorance, and that pesthouse of the time (foppery.) But what I would speake, silence shall be my Attourney, and pleade both for times reformation, and your perpetuall happynesse.
