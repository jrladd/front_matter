THou hast here an
essay of Fancy,
where Invention
is shewed with Judgment.
Is was not the Authors
intention (I presume) to
discourse thee into a belief
of each particular circum∣stance.
Tis fit thou allow

him a liberty of conceit;
where thou takest to thy
self a liberty of judgment.
In substance, thou hast
here a new discovery of a
new World, which per∣chance
may finde little bet∣ter
entertainment in thy
opinion, than that of Co∣lumbus
at first, in the
esteem of all men. Yet his
than but poor espyall of
America, betray'd unto
knowledge so much as hath

since encreast into a vaste
plantation. And the then
unknown, to be now of as
large extent as all other
the known World.
That there shoud be An∣tipodes
was once thought
as great a Paradox as
now that the Moon should
be habitable. But the
knowledge of this may
seem more properly reser∣ved
for this our discove∣ring
age: In which our

lilaeusses, can by advan∣tage
of their spectacles
gaze the Sun into spots, &
descry mountaines in the
Moon. But this and more
in the ensuing discourse I
leave to thy candid cen∣sure,
and the faithfull re∣lation
of the little eye-wit∣nesse,
our great discoverer.
