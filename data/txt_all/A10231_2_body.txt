Worthy Sir:
AS I haue begun, and proceeded herein by your Instigation, I present it to your acceptation, if any thing be worth your account, I dare iustifie the truth of it: if nothing, I shall neuer grieue at the suppression. In briefe, I wrote it for you, and dedicate it to you, and am only sorry it comes vn∣seasonably. My Voyage into India, remarkable in a Carracks losse, and Captaine Iosephs death,Read. M. Ter∣ries Relation of these things, L▪ 9. &c. my Employment at Surat, Cambaia, and Amadera, from thence at Callecut vpon the Coast of Mala∣barre, at Priaman and Tecoo vpon Sumatra, and then to Bantam and Iacatra vpon Iaua, would afford more matter of discourse: but I haue chosen Musulipatnam, from which Centre I haue drawne  these rude lines, yet strait ones, and parallel to the truth: so that although, none shall please to sayle by my Compasse, yet am I sufficiently contented in hauing kept within compasse, and so I rest, a true louer of you and your elabourate Ʋolumes.

FINIS.
