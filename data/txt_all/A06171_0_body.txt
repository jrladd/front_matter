Right noble Madames (and more noble in that de∣uout) I haue made
you patronesses of a iust cause, the teares of a matchlesse mother, shed for a
Sauior & a sonne: If to begin your new yeere you shall but peruse these in
deuotion, I doubt  but they wil proue holy
motiues of meditation: in shed∣ding one teare with Marie, you shall con∣fesse
with Barnard, that you purchase much interest in Iesus. I ioyne you in this
greatest of your honors, not for your births   
 sake, (for wee may disparage our selues) neither your wealth sake,
(for riches are as the deaw in Aprill) but for your ver∣tue sake (which
retaineth this qualitie of the Sunne, communicating his beames to all things,
inriching euerie one without impouerishing himself.) Good Madames, accept these
teares in their nature, and hold it better to weepe many times with Iesus and
Marie, than to laugh with Be∣lial and the world for the world hath de∣ceiued
you long, but pietie will eternize you for euer. If you shall but grace what I
giue, my desires are satisfied: if giue what you owe, you shall grieue when you
reade, if as you reade you consider, you haue the end of true consideration.
For to lament sinne, is to redeeme sinne.
Noble Ladies, vse not these giftes as the Romane Matrones their
puppies, spit not in their mouthes to make them waite at your heeles: neither
cocker them at your breastes, least Caesar holde you more  careful
of your whelpes than your sonnes: but vse them as the goldsmith his mettal,
trie them at the test of your contemplati∣on, and so prise them. God worke that
in your hearts, that my deuotion intendeth to your soules, and blesse you in
gi∣uing mee grace to serue him.
