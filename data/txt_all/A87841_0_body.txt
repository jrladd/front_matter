Right Honourable, and high Councell of State,
AS I acknowledge it a rich mercy from God, that he hath accounted me worthy, (though unworthiest of my selfe) to suf∣fer any thing for the Name of Christ;Acts. . so this addeth to the setting off the sufferings, that by your Order, and under your Authority (Right Honourable) this Epitomie thereof (and but an Epitomie) is published to the view of all, many of whom, yet alive, were Eye-witnesses to my nflictions. And as it was a part of Pauls hap∣pinesse (though a prisoner) to plead before Ag∣grippa,
Acts 26.2. so I account it a singular favour, that you (more expert then Aggrippa in the Truths of Christ,) have heard pleaded, and adjudged me and my Cause, with so full and satisfactory a Judgment, that nothing can be added, but Exe∣cution: And therefore with humble and hearty thankes, give me leave further to intreat your Honours, that with Christ, and for Christ, you would finish the Work that the Father hath given you to doe,John 17.4. And for my particu∣lar, as you have broke my bonds, and brought my Weather-beaten Bark to Shore, so I am confident, you will not suffer me to perish in the Haven, Nam turpe laborantem deseru∣isse in portu non fraginum facere.
