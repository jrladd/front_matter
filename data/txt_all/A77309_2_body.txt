HOW many praying Persons in the High-Peak do (and will) rise up and call you Blessed? and with you many noble Citizens, who promote the Work of the Lord therein. We cannot think of the Fall of your late dear Son-in-Law
Good Mr. Coupe., without Grief: He (together with Reverend Mr. How) set on foot that charitable Work, which that Worshipful Knight Alâˆ£derman Abney, hath continued, and is now committed to your Hand. Blessed be God for you! and you of him, that so favour the Place of my Birth and Labours. May you and all that derive from you, and all the bountiful Persons that join with you, be blessed indeed here and hereafter! So prayeth, Noble Sir,
