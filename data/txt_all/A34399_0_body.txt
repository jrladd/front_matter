My LORDS,
IT was a Custom much us'd by
the Ancient Writers among
the Greeks and Romans, to

Dedicate their Books to their most
particular Friends, and sometimes
to Intitle and call them by their
Friends Names. In our Age,
wherein we either do, or shou'd
imitate Antiquity in all com∣mendable
things, This laudable
Custom is either wholly laid aside,
or practis'd by so few, that they
almost escape Observance. If in∣deed
this Method of Dedicating
Books was chang'd into a better,
I should have no reason to com∣plain,
but rather to applaud the
happy Genius of our Times, for
outshining the brightest days
of Antiquity: But most assured∣ly,
we can find no causes for such
Triumphs. The Dedications now
made in England and France
(which two Countries in this Age,
we may Parallel with the fore∣mention'd
Greece and Italy, upon

the Score of Excellence in Wit,
with respect to the rest of Europe)
Our Dedications, I say, are so full
of nauseous and fulsom Flatte∣ries,
and Most of 'em so general∣ly
made up of about a dozen long
Words, variously turn'd and di∣spers'd;
that for my part, I won∣der
how any Man can proceed
any further in a Book of such
small hopes, but must needs lay
it down, and chuse rather to go
to Bounding-Stones with Augustus.
Nay, this crying Sin of the Nati∣on
is come to that pass, that even
our Poets, who were made and
fram'd on purpose in such a
Make, as only to lash Vice with
the severest Satyr, are yet most
abominably guilty of this crime.
When an excellent Comedy has
appear'd on the Stage for some
time, and perhaps done the Work

of an Hundred Homilies, in
visiting and reclaiming Mankind
from their evil▪ ways; it comes
forth in Print, and all is spoil'd
again by a wicked Dedication in
the beginning, which propagat
Atheism; so that no man can
believe the Poet is honest, and
speaks his mind in the Play,
while he talks so lewdly and con∣tradictorily
in the Dedication: It
was not so in Ben. Johnson's days.
What I have said of Epistles
Dedicatory in general, may part∣ly
seem to hook my self into the
crowd of these numerous Trans∣gressors,
while I inscribe this
Book to your Great Names. But
several Things I have to alledg
for my self. First, tho this Piece
be not presented to any private
Friend of its Author in Emulati∣on
of the Ancients; yet as far as

possibly, I have followed their
Sacred Rules and Canons, in a
Work of this publick Nature.
For it is the Life of one of the
Greatest and Wisest Princes that
ver Sway'd the English, or any
other Scepter: And to whom
cou'd I better devote His Life,
than to His Greatest and Wisest
Friends, (for such He always
call'd His best Servants?) Ye are
concern'd, MY LORDS, in eve∣ry
Page of this Book, and can
witness what is here related, to
be true. No part of His Life,
but wherein some of you have
had a share; In His Education,
His Exile, His Sufferings, His
Victories, His Triumphs. And
while I write his Life, in some
measure I write Yours. For such
is the fate of Celsitude and ho∣nour,
that Great Men (in some

sense) do frequently Dye before
Sixty three: And to be sure, when
a Prince falls, he does not fall a∣lone;
but several Others have
their Lives interchangeably writ
with his.
Besides, MY LORDS, being
unable to find any Object nearer
to him, than Your selves, except
his Majesty, (whom God long
preserve) and the Family Royal;
I lay under an indispensable ne∣cessity
of imploring your Lord∣ships
Patronage: For such is my
Veneration to the Blood of my
Prince, that by no means can I be
perswaded to think the ensuing
Papers fit for his most Sacred and
Princely Eye, or worthy a Royal
Protection; and I am resolv'd to
be as Innocent as I can, and
not offend One Prince, after
having committed Treason a∣gainst
the Fame of another.

However, MY LORDS, tho this
be not a Piece fit for a Kings Ca∣binet;
yet I hope this Image of
our late Sovereigns Life will not
be refus'd by Your Lordships,
since we love the Pictures of those
Persons we admire, let 'em be
never so unfinisht, let them be
drawn by what hand soever.
The other Thing which I pro∣pos'd
to my self in this Address,
was the avoiding Flattery; tho
it may seem a very unnecessary
Caution; since he that looks up to
such a Thick-set Conglobation,
and (as it were) Galaxy of hea∣venly
Virtues, must easily infer,
that they are too high for Flat∣tery,
and too bright to have any
lustre added to them. With all
the Tragical forces of Eloquence
I might here expatiate on the To∣picks
of Grand Descent, of Ti∣tles

and honours, of Policy and
Government, of Arms and Learn∣ing,
of the Tent and the Closet:
But it is not my design to manage
these common Subjects. And I
beg leave of your Lordships to
say, That in the front of a Book
consecrated to the fame of
CHARLES the IId, I think I
shou'd do an Injury to him, if I
endeavour'd professedly to write
any other Panegyrick but his;
tho at the same time I must needs
include Your Lordships Praises.
And herein I have determin'd to
take a View of the King himself,
and not of his Deeds, (that Pro∣vince
I leave to his history) and
to set his personal Virtues, and
not additional Actions before your
Eyes; for a bad man may do a praise-worthy
thing, but a good man
himself can only be praised. Many

Kings themselves do either hear
or read their own Commendations,
and take care to see their own
Glory setled before they dye:
But such kind of Annals usually
is as mortal as their Subject, and
as soon turns to Ashes. No, His
late Majesties Praise shall not be
Mercenary; The World after
his Death shall believe the King
was the least Thing in him. And
Posterity shall know the happiness
of England and this Age, when
it shall see, we are not silent of a
good Prince after his Decease;
for it is a sign, that there is as
good a One, or a better on the
Throne.
And this Task I the more wil∣lingly
undertake, MY LORDS,
First, because it is impossible for
any man to want, or matter, or
words, while he writes of him;

and 'tis a Subject, that even Dulness
it self wou'd Treat of wittily;
And secondly, because not only
all Europe, but the whole World,
and Posterity it self, will joyn with
me in his Praises. For the Out∣most
Rounds of the Earth were
acquainted with him; and he esta∣blish'd
our Commerce so univer∣sally,
that whatever Product was
generated in any Country, seem'd
to be the Native of Ours; and
in every Season of the Year, we
had a perpetual Autumn, Fruits
arriving from every part of this
Globe. And as his Name will
be laid up in the Libraries of Asia,
and men must hear his Praises by
Interpreters; so likewise, our Po∣sterity,
no doubt, will help us in
praising him, who are at present
too much over-loaden with one
burthen, that of Grief for His

inexpressible loss, to undertake
such another as that of celebra∣ting
him.
I shall not seek to fetch Enco∣miums
from comparing him with
his Ancestors, and so try by les∣sening
them, to amplifie his
Greatness: That is a trick, I do
not pretend to; let his fame stand
at the expence of no mans else.
For as all the Talents and Virtues
of his Forefathers, he in such wise
united in himself, as that not one
of them was wanting while he
lived; and as it is common for a
Prince to be better than his Pre∣decessors,
but to be better than all
his Predecessors belong'd to him
alone; so he that detracts from
them, detracts from him. And
(for one instance) who dare sa∣crilegiously
invade the Majesty of
CHARLES the 1st (in hopes to

diminish it) who neither said, nor
did, nor wrote, nor begot any
thing but what was Great?
So Divine a Prince, none was
thought worthy by Heav'n it self,
immediately to Succeed but he:
And therefore, after that Nature
had made several Tryals in Henry
the Great's Daughter, for five
Years space, towards the Produ∣ction
of something perfect and
absolute, she at length made this
acceptable Present to the World.
As soon as Born, Heaven took
notice of him, and ey'd him with
a Star, appearing in defiance of
the Sun at Noon-day, either to
note, That his Life shou'd be
continu'd with Miracles, as it be∣gan
with one; or that his Glory
shou'd shine like a Star; or else to
prove, That if it be question'd,
whether Sovereigns be given us

by chance, or by the hand of the
Almighty, it is here manifest, that
this Prince came from Heav'n,
and that there is a World of dif∣ference
put betwixt Kings super∣naturally
made by God, and those
electively made by Man.
In his Education afterwards,
he excell'd in all those corporal
Exercises, and that growth of Bo∣dy,
for which Antiquity appoint∣ed
the Sons of the Gods, and
Husbands of the Goddesses to be
so Remarkable. And as the shape
of his Body, so the form of his
mind was truly and universally
Imperial: It had the command
of whatever Notion or Thing was
presented to it, whether Divine
or Humane, without any foreign
Explication; and as it were by
Intuition, he saw the Ideas of all
things in his own breast.

In his first Years, he promis'd
that Virtue which his Fathers and
his own Miseries gave him an
early and a large Field to shew to
the World, and which he kept en∣tire
and unshaken to the last; his
Mind being still more and more
strengthned by difficulties. And
(to speak a little freely, MY
LORDS,) when Ye remember
him amid all his distresses, and
the most insupportable stroaks of
Fortune, unrepining, and not let∣ting
the least complaint escape
from him, or the least fear seize
upon him; You must either fan∣cy
something in him above Man,
or that the gods themselves might
learn of him one Virtue, that of
constancy and firmness of mind;
For Seneca shews us, that Hercules
himself (the great and perfect
Model of true Virtue and Va∣lour)

in his last Agonies did
complain, ev'n to Desperation.
Adorn'd with such Virtues, who
cou'd not but love him? Even Sea-Rebels
(as rough and boisterous as
their own Element) grow ten∣der-hearted,
and set their Admiral
on shore, delivering themselves
up to him; and the Love of the
Prince prevails more with them,
than the Piety of their King.
When in Exile, as with his
Fame he had before fill'd other
Nations, so now he bless'd 'em
with his presence. By barbarous
Rebels he was forc'd to venture
the Hospitality of Princes; yet
the King of France was not a∣fraid
of abiding in the French
Kings Dominions. But whatever
jealousies he might conceive of
his own safety; whatever bad news
he received from England; how

great soever were the Progresses
made by Cromwel, he thought
this his greatest Unhappiness, that
he shou'd have so many Calami∣tous
Friends both at home and
abroad.
His Restoration I can compare
to nothing better, than that easie,
delicious, and jocund Temper of
the Elements, of Heaven, the Air,
and Sea, after a violent and out∣ragious
Tempest, or rather after
the great Deluge of the World;
at which Time, he prov'd himself
the Noah's Dove, that finding no
Rest any where, was receiv'd a∣gain
into his own Ark, and
brought a peaceable Olive-Leaf
in his Mouth. Which Revolution
was the alone work of Providence
and the General. For nothing but
an Almighty Power hath Domi∣nion
over the minds of Men. He

did not leap on Shore with his
Sword in his Hand, by way of
Compulsion; but he was saluted
with the free and unanimous
Voice of three great Nations. As
he had no other real Enemies but
his own Country, so in this he
appeared more than Conqueror,
that he vanquish'd the very minds
of his enemies. Never was such
a Triumph seen at Rome. Others
have rode on a Chariot with four
white Horses, or more arrogantly
have been carri'd on Mens Shoul∣ders;
but he was brought in by
the hearts of Men. That Name
which others get by conquer'd
Natons, he got by repenting
ones; and only by returning out
of exile into his own Country
(which was exil'd, when he was
so) he lookt in the Poets Lan∣guage,

Like Mars returning from the
Noble Chace
Of flying Nations through the
Plains of Thrace.
At one time never was so much
Joy heap'd together in England.
It seem'd as if all the Melan∣cholly
of the former years was
purposely designed to introduce
and heighten the so extravagant
gladness of that great Day, that
some were ready to wish for a
Renovation of the Civil Wars,
that they might have that day
repeated to them over again. E∣very
man thought that himself
received the shouts he gave; and
every subject fancied himself a
Monarch. The sick imagine, they
are restored to health, by seeing
his God-like Person: Some cry,
they have lived long enough:

Others, Now they ought, rather,
to live longer. Traitors them∣selves
drink the King's Health
heartily: They admire him more,
that he wou'd not, than that ever
he should be in a possibility to re∣venge
himself; and that he shou'd
remember Injuries only to for∣give
them.
Let him ascend, and there was
a due Majesty restor'd to the
Throne, Authority to the Laws,
Reverence to inferior Magistrates,
and the sacred Order of Bishops
to Religion, like a Treasure found
from a Ship-wrack, after many
Years rouling in a tempestuous
Sea.
Thus terminating all publick
differences and confusions by
Peace, he adorn'd Peace it self
with good Arts, which receiv'd
both their Countrey with him,

and their Protection under him,
by his opening the Temple of
Janus, and that of the Muses at
the same time. For himself had
as great a Knowledg in Letters
as any Prince in Christendom; and
he most acurately understood Na∣vigation,
Astronomy, and most
parts of the Mathematicks. An
huge delight he took in conver∣sing
freely with the most knowing
Men in those pleasant and useful
Studies: And he endeavour'd to
promote them (as much as possi∣ble)
in others, by publick En∣dowments,
and Liberal Rewards.
Besides this severer sort of No∣tices,
he had a great insight into
all those softer Arts which become
a private Gentleman. And in his
Reign we may say, That Wit
did first reign here, and appear'd
upon the Stage as on a Throne:

It was scarcely more encourag'd
and environ'd with greater Pomp
and Splendor at Rome, under the
peaceable Reign of Augustus after
that long Civil War, wherein the
Sword would permit nothing
else to be sharp, besides it self.
Tho he had as much Good-Nature
as wou'd perhaps have
serv'd an Hundred other Men
(a Word peculiar to our English
Tongue, and a Thing peculiar
to this Prince, as the Great Chan∣cellor
remark'd), yet he was ob∣served
to take an extream delight
in that Part of Poesy, which is
not very famous for Good Na∣ture,
I mean Satyr. Doubtless
this sort of Writing, is the best
and most beneficial of all others,
which the Poets follow; for it
not only tells Mankind of, but it
chastises them for their Faults.

And I wonder, that the Ancients,
when they bestowed so many se∣veral
kinds of Poetry to the Fa∣vour
and Influence of so many
Muses, they could not find in
their hearts to allow one Goddess
to Satyr. But whatever unkind∣ness
it finds in Heaven, I am sure
in our Age it has found Protection
upon earth, witness the great good
Offices the French King hath
done it in the Person of Boileau.
For, that Prince is not like Alexan∣der
of a Spanish stamp and Com∣plexion,
so wholly transported
with the Giddiness of Romantick
Stories, as that he cannot dream
of conquering the World with∣out
having Homer for his Bed-fellow;
but what he reads is good
sense, and honest Nature, with∣out
any vain and extravagant
additions. And this he does in imi∣tation

of his Late Majesty (who
was the oldest, and by conse∣quence
the most exemplary Prince
in the Christian World), tho
under far worse Circumstances.
For the latter was much better ca∣pacitated
through his extensive
Knowledg in Nature, and the
Intricacies of Matter and Moti∣on,
as well as in all Polite Learn∣ing:
and I think, I shou'd do no
man an Injury, if I say, he under∣stood
Butler the best in England.
How Good and Gracious a
Master he was, You MY LORDS,
can best declare; Ye knew him
the most searching Judg of Men,
that held in his hands both re∣wards
and punishments: In the
last indeed, he was very sparing;
and the offending Courtier was
usually excus'd before hand, ve∣ry
seldom to be excus'd. The

Punishment, he thought, was
sufficient in the very Vexation of
the Delinquent. Warily and by
Degrees, his Rewards were distri∣buted,
that there might still be a
further Prospect in view by way
of Encouragement; For nothing
conduces more to following Ho∣nours,
than the former well ad∣ministred:
And never at one leap
was any supreme place conferred,
unless for some Transcendent,
and (as I may call it) superna∣tural
pice of Loyalty. Our No∣blesse
he both preserved and aug∣mented;
lest the condition of
such should be worse, as deserved
to have a Noble Posterity, than
of such as had Noble Ancestors.
Not a Soldier was there, that had
received Wounds in his Service,
but he counted, and rewarded
them in an ample manner: And

thorough all succeeding Ages
He will be a Benefactor as well
as an example to Soldiers at Chel∣sea;
where as long as we shall have
a Country to Defend, or an E∣nemy
to Combate, His Name
will be evermore remembred, for
what is bestow'd upon Posterity,
ought to be Immortal.
You likewise, MY LORDS,
can give the best Attestation to his
Offices of Privacy, and his great
Virtues of Humility and Con∣descention,
which yet had a kind
of Majestick Royalty with them.
Ye remember him, when he was
in Exile, and as a private man,
how he resembled a King; and
how whilest a restored Monarch,
and in his most illustrious days,
he seem'd to be a private Citizen.
That in his greatest Prosperity he
had not the least Haughtiness nor

Elation of Mind; but being se∣cure
of his own greatness, was not
afraid of degrading himself into
the likeness of a Subject. Ye
know, how much time he bestow'd
on the cares of Empire, how much
on the Duties of Devotion, Phi∣losophy,
and Vertue; how short
his Sleeps, and the unbendings of
his mind were: A smart walk, a
mouthful of fresh Air, and a little
ingenious raillery.
Such a Prince must needs be no
less lov'd than admir'd: The Af∣fection
and Reverence of his Sub∣jects
wou'd stand him instead of
terror. His own Virtue wou'd
serve him for a Guard, and his
Sword rather for Ornament than
Defence.
But what Charms can with∣stand
the Ingratitude and Malice
of accursed and diabolick Rebels?

Against his Sacred Life we had a
Salamanca-Plot, wherein the Suf∣ferers
seem'd to be more choqu'd
at the Injustice of the Evidence,
than at the severity of the Sen∣tence:
They seem'd to bear all
magnanimously, and with the
bravery of Innocence. And with
good reason might they do so,
since they had for a Co-partner in
Dishonour (which to her was worse
than Death) the most Pious, and
Virtuous Princess that England
ever deserv'd to see. We had,
likewise, a most hellish Fanatick
Conspiracy, the Discovery of
which discover'd ALL. Then
Heaven began to look kindly
down upon us, and withdraw
its Plagues, especially that great
Egyptian Darkness, wherewith
we had been blinded: And the
Froggs and Vermine which were

got into the Royal Bed-Cham∣bers,
found it high time to re∣cede.
Then the Delatores began to
fear as much as they were fear'd
before: And the Laws were now
more dreaded than perjur'd Schis∣maticks.
Then Sham-Magistrates
put off their consulary Honours,
and public Spoils; And the King of
England became first LORD OF
LONDON: Which City, while
he restrain'd its Liberties, he ren∣dred
more free.
But here, MY LORDS, we
come to a full point; and here
ye must take your leave of him.
For when he had run thorough
all the violences of a tumultuary
Life, when he had escap'd all
these dangers of impious and un∣reasonable
men, when he now had
establish'd His Throne in Safety,
Peace and Righteousness, and (as

we may properly say) just now
began to enjoy himself, and you
him, behold! He is taken away
from you. Who can forbear
complaining of the uncertain
Estate and frail Condition of hu∣man
kind, when neither the most
inestimable riches and un-perish∣ing
Graces of the mind, nor the
most enlarged Extremities of
Glory and Greatness, spreading
on the one hand towards the
War-like Thunder, or on the
other towards the Peaceful
Scepter, nor even the hearty and
united Prayers of a Virtuous
People, cou'd impart Efficacy
enough to make one Person im∣mortal,
or should be able to hin∣der
the disunion of one Soul from
a Body? That he who had his
youthful Years try'd by the Au∣sterity
of a gloomy Fate, and had

avoided so many Parliamentary
tricks laid or His Life, and
being the true , did al∣most
Suffer Martyrdom with his
Father; Who in that Fatal day
of Worcester differed only from
the common Soldiers in courage
and Eminence, rejoicing as oft as
the Bullets graz'd upon His Hel∣met
or Buckler; Who in his
Flight thence (like another Ae∣eas
envelop'd in a Cloud by his
Mother) pass'd through all the
amazing Maeanders of Provi∣dence,
vvhile Posterity shall come
o see, and shevv their Children
the Cottage vvhere he rbb'd
off his Martial Dust, and the sa∣cred
Tree vvherein he lay hid;
That he vvho at his Restoration
as stil'd the English Titus, The
elight of Mankind, and the on∣
Restorative to a Nation so

long opprest by Civil War;
who afterwards reach'd the utmost
Degrees of Fame by staining the
English Seas so often with his
Victories, and encreasing the Ar∣mory
in the Tower; That he,
who was the Supreme Arbiter of
Life and Death, and Europe's
Moderator, [who when moved,
the World was mov'd, and when
quiet, it was still]; And who, if
he had lived an hundred Years,
the People would never have
been tired with his Government,
should dye like one of us?
But let this be our Consolation,
that when ordinary men dye, they
dye; but when a Good Prince
expires, it is not his Death, but
his immediate Apotheosis: he pre∣sently
flies to the Kingdom of
Heaven, and there reigneth for
evermore (as also here by his

example) exchanging a Tem∣poral
for an Eternal Crown of
Glory. Lest therefore we should
seem to repine at his happiness,
let us no longer think two Eyes
too few to pay the Tribute of our
Tears, and bedew his Ashes with∣al;
Let not every Subject weep,
as if it were at his Fathers Fune∣ral,
not only something of his
own Accord, but more out of In∣stinct,
and the command of Na∣ture;
Let not this one Spectacle
be as hideous and doleful as that
of Xerxes numerous Army; Let
not the Maps of the whole Earth
in proportion to the dimensions
of his Fame, be hung in Black;
Let not that colour be the Live∣ry
of Mens Souls as well as their
Bodies any longer; And let not
the very Graces and Joy it self
weep any more; Neither let the

expressions of our sorrow be as
abundant as our sorrovv it self:
in regard he himself took the
greatest care imaginable in his
Life-time, that we should not la∣ment
his Death, and that he
should not be miss't; but has left
us not only a Successor, but (in
a manner) the Partner and Com∣panion
of his Throne, and
(which is above all) his Dearest
Friend; so that we have not lost,
but only chang'd a Gracious So∣yereign,
in whom we find so ma∣ny
God-like Perfections, that we
shall never be tempted to adore
the Former, now since his transla∣tion,
and pay Religious Worship
to him, instead of Allegiance.
And now, MY LORDS, what
remains? But, That as nothing
could have repair'd our ineffable
Loss of CHARLES the IId, but

the Succession of JAMES the IId,
we prostrate our selves at the feet
of Almighty God, by whom Kings
Reign; imploring him, that it may
be many Years, before we have
the same occasion for Grief; put∣ting
up our Vows for the Kings
Health, and the Eternity of this
Empire, that he would grant
him a long and a prosperous
Reign over us; that never his
Breast may be sensible of any sigh
unless it be at Devotion; nor his
Face know any Wrinkle or Con∣traction,
unless like Thunder, to
strike Traitors and Exclusioners
Dead; That his days may be up∣on
Earth, as the days of Heaven:
That as he hath been the Great
Argument of Providence by esca∣ping
so many Perils in War, Perils
by Sea, and Perils by his own Coun∣try-men;
so he may still remain

the Great Mathusalem of Provi∣dence,
and [that we may see that
CHARLES is not yet dead] still
live to demonstrate, that Heaven
is infinite in its Mercies, and does
embrace both him and it self in
Eternal Circulations; that with∣out
any new Disloyal, and discri∣minating
times, he may at length
arise to that Pitch of Power, and
continue in that heigth of Safety,
Success, and Glory, till Treason
shall be lookt upon as deplora∣ble
Madness, not for that it is
Wicked, but Desperate; And
lastly, That by an uninterrup∣ted
series of Tranquillity, his
Happy Subjects may think
him so happy, that if the Op∣tion
was given to any One of
them, he would chuse it as a
better Condition to be King
JAMES his Subject, than to be

Monarch of Anothers more
large and Wealthy Territo∣ries.
I am,
MY LORDS,

March 19. 1684-85.
