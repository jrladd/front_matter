HOnorable and worthy Dames,
aswell wiues widowes maides,
of all estates & degrees, whosoe∣euer
or wheresoeuer with all
humblenes and knees bēded &
bowed to the ground let me be∣seech
your patience, that haue
vndertaken a subiect of that ex∣cellency
as would haue required
a more pregnant & excellent wit then I doe acknowledge
to be in my selfethe, brightnes of the sunne is best discer∣ned
by her own beames, and the excellency of women is
not to bee expressed, but by their owne merittes if I haue
therefore set vp too dimne a light to blazon your perfe∣ctions,
let your owne vertues shine in that wonted oryen∣tall
brightnesse, as from your first creation (at all times
and in all ages) hath so illumined the worlde, with
those high and rare perfections, as men may
well admire but neuer bee able to extin∣guish.
Thus desiring still to liue in
your gracefull loue and fauour
will rest the most assured
at your comande∣ments.
