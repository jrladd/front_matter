SIR,
SAint Paul having descended lately to view Italy, and other places, as you may trace him in the following Discourse, He would not take his flight backe to Heaven before he had given you a visit, who have so well deserved of his Church here, the goodliest pile of stones in Christenâˆ£dome of that kinde.
Of all the men of our times, you are one of the greatest Examples of Piety and solid Integrity, which discovers a noble soule to dwell within you; so that, me thinks, I see Saint Paul saluting and solacing you, that those constant works of Charity you daily doe (and them in such a manner, that the left

hand knowes not what the right doth) will be as a Triumphant Chariot to carry you one day up to Heaven, to partake of the same beatitude with Him.
Amongst those multitudes that honour you, I am one, and have done so a long time; and as a small testimony hereof, I send you this new kinde of Discourse, composed lately by a noble Personage in Italian, of which Language you are so great a Master.
For the first part of this Discourse, which consists of a kinde of Dialogue 'twixt the two first Persons of the Holy Trinity, there are Examples of that kinde in some of the Fathers of the Primitive Church; as Apollinarius, and Nazianzen, and lately Grotius hath the like in his Tragedy of Christs Passion, which may serve to free it from all exception:
So I most affectionately kisse your hands, and am

 Fleet 25. of March.
