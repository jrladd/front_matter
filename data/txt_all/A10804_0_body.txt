RIght VVorshipfull, long since in those im∣ployments I had for the Irish affayres, in the time of our most dread and gracious Soueraigne, decea∣sed, and euer sithence, I sought opportuni∣tie, to make some shewe of my zeale vnto you, but time neuer fauoring the expectation of my desired thought, I was enforced to keepe silent my loues intention. Yet now hauing some occa∣sion, through these great and most honorable fa∣uours shewed vnto the gracious and renowmed

King of Denmarke, at his being heere, by our famous King, Nobilitie, and States of our Land, whereof many haue beene eye-witnesses neere this honorable Citie: Yet considering, that many thousands which desired to see the same, haue been debarred of their contentments there∣in, and hauing bestowed my time and charge, in noting from time to time, what hath been done in all honor to welcome this renowmed King in seuerall places, and sundry honorable pastimes (no doubt) to the eternall honor of his Maiestie and this Land, I haue emboldned my selfe to publish the same vnder your VVorships pro∣tection, and beseech you of your accustomed cle∣mencie so to accept it, as it is faithfully enten∣ded: so shall I bind my selfe euer to your seruice, and in all duty rest your VVorships,
