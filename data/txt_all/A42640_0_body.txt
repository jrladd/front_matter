Honoured Sir;
IN reverence to your Person, and in regard to your venerable Age, J have made choice of you to be the Patron of this Funerall Ser∣mon: I present to your Eyes, what lately you heard with your Eares: It was Penned and Prea∣ched upon the occasion of your much esteemed Brothers death, and at the solemnizing of his Fu∣nerals: Your Christian VVis∣dome,

according to the pregnan∣cy of your VVit and Apprehen∣sion, hath approved hereof, and recommended it to the Presse. I intended it should have ended in the delivery of it; but yeelding to your just importunity, and the benefit of some private Freinds, I have made it publique: Besides these are dying Times, and mine is but a Sermon of Death to the Living: All that I desire is to mind us of our Mortalitie, to mind us of our Condition, that we are here as Strangers and Pil∣grims; that we have here no a∣biding nor continuing City; that we dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust,

which shortly must be broken in peeces. The Lord fit us for the day of dissolution, and the houre of our departure: The Lord grant that our last houre may be our best hour; that our work may be done before our day be done: That when we shall come to die, we may have nothing else to doe but to die: For the hour of death will be the busie hour, then Sa∣tan will be busie, and Conscience will be busie: These things the Lord of Heaven and Earth root in our hearts. Sir, I desire the Al∣mighty God to bless and prosper you; the Lord accomplish unto you your honourable and chari∣table intentions; And so I rest,
