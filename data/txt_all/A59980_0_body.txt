My Lord,
THis Book, which took first life from your Acceptance, having since received strength and or∣nament from your influence, most hum∣bly returneth to kisse your hand, and present the constant devotion of your Honourer.
It hath met no unhappy entertain∣ment abroad, though some, swaid by their implicite faith, think all to be Heresie that retains not the old letter; like those Ilanders, who are so much in love with Antiquity, and the tract of their Predecessors, that they hold it impiety to sweep a Roome, that hath

contracted the dust of foure Generati∣ons in their Family. Others, for want of leisure to peruse, or judgement to examine, will not heare of the leas change, though it bring with it a nea¦rer path to profit or knowledge.
I am not so bold to call This a new way to Learning, since the Fundamen¦talls are no other then consist with the integrity of the best Grammars. B where I could facilitate the Method  Rules, and in a hundred miles travel gain two parts of the way, I though I might do an acceptable service  young Scholars, whose memories have been so long in persecution; for the Nouns and Verbs made perfect, up¦on which we raise the safest Structure there are not so many lines to be com¦mitted to Memory, as are contained  those Latine Rules of Verbs, prescri¦bed in the Ordinary Grammar.
But here some may object,
—Brevis esse laboro,
Obscurus fio—
Too frequent a consequence of Com∣endiaries; It will not become the mo∣desty I have hitherto retained; to mag∣nifie my own, but I submit to the expe∣rience of cleer and candid judgments, that small beame may be a conduct brough the whole edifice, though it ould be guided by a common Disci∣pline.
Next to the publike benefit, my oughts are ambitious, that these may obtain your Lordships second ile upon them, which will be an in∣couragement to me, to improve the next Edition, with the accesse of that oeticall Part, which concerneth Ver∣s and their Composition.
Pardon, I beseech your Lordship, is boldnesse of renewing my addres∣s to your Honour, whilest I prophesie om your early Dawne, the advance∣ment

of your Name to after ages, and in this, acknowledge it my happinesse, if under the shade of your Morning, I may live, and write my self
My Lord,
