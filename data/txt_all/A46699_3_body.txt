Gentlemen,
I Have joined you together in this De∣dication, to publish your Conjunction in a very laudable, and Charitable acti∣on, The giving of a plentifull Exhi∣bition for the maintenance of a poore youth, Student in the University of Oxon; A rare Example in these daies in Gentlemen, of whom how few can the greatest impor∣tunity



winne to spare any thing from their superfluities for so good an use? But your Liberality was so forward, as that it needed no spurre, nor Excitation, only it called for direction unto a meet object. That this should be published in Print, was a thing, I believe, you never desi∣red, nor expected: But though you doe not expect the praises of men, as being acted by a higher principle; yet you may lawfully accept them; provided, as Theseus dedi∣cated unto Hercules the Temples that were built in his own honour, so you doe not suffer these praises to be ter∣minated in your selves; but carry them further, and higher unto that God, who hath given you hearts and estates for such a worke. There remaines yet one thing to be done, and that is, that we all, you, and I, joine in sincere and un∣feigned prayers unto God for his blessing upon the studies of him, unto whom you have shewn such Munificence; for though you water this plant, 'tis God alone can give the increase; Unto this God I commend you and yours, and rest
