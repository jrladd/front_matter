Forwards, to justifie and a∣vouch
the acts of those Pa∣rents
who hereafter shall fix
the Sacrament on their In∣fant
Children: Your Honors
in Gods due time, may for

who here am the Advocate
to plead for the Baptizing of
others, to be also the Orator
to pray for the Birth of your
Children, till which time,
may the blessings of the right
and left hand plentifully fall,
and peaceably rest on you
both, which is the daily de∣sire
