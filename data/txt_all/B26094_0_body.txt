SIR,
THis is the fourth time, that I have ad∣dressed Your ROYAL HIGHNESS, I dare not add with success and approbation; yet, I'm sure, not beyond the circle of my duty, nor without a strong impulse to admire and applaud the amiable parts, and attractive vertues so conspi∣cuous in your Person, and in every Scene of your Actions, that Malice cannot impute it to an insinu∣ating and fawning humour. My first address got no unkind reception from your favourable Candour; but, writing in that dialect, being unfashionable in the British Isle, and consequent∣ly unseasonable to your HIGHNESS, (having sown the seed of your tender years  the field of Mars, and reap'd the rich increase thereof in ri∣per age) you was pleased to make use of the convey∣ing conduit of a ROYAL and skilful INTER∣PRETESS: I amended the former escape in the second Address, by the addition of an accom∣panying
 Guide, of your own Countrey fashion, tho not breeding; under whose conduct, I could not promise my travelling Muse an easie passage, having never appeared on the stage before, in an English habit. To the third (deckt altogether in your own native dress, and) hastened by your sudden departure, I premised, and repeated this Ʋshering TETRASTICK;
Be pleas'd, Sir, to accept fruit pluck'd in haste,
Which, if they relish well, you're woo'd to taste;
But if they nauseate, or no pleasure yield,
I'l raze the tree, and henceforth curse the field.
When lo your graceful smiles, and courtly ge∣sture spake a kind Acceptation, and encourag'd me to make this fourth address; The subject whereof, viz. your glad return, was as acceptable to my pensive Muse, as the genial Muses are welcome to overtravelled Minds; as the Honou∣rable E. of ROSECOMMON (upon Horace his Art of Poetrie) singeth well;
Some have by Verse obtain'd the Love of KINGS,
Who with the Muses ease their weari'd minds.

And albeit this inelaborate Poem should m of that end; and tho the stile be not so loftie, nor the veine so happy, as I could wish, and think wor∣thy wherewith to entertain and present your HIGHNESS; yet, in a homely way, I have given a plain testimony of zealous Loy∣alty to my Sov'raign; and consequently of du∣tiful respect (if the effects of either were to be noticed in such a mean Gentleman) to his dear and only Brother. Vouchsafe, therefore, ROY∣AL SIR, to accept the humble tender of an obsequious Muse; and, in these injurious and tempestuous times, daign to shrowd her under the hospitable shade of your Protection; or, as the famous abovenamed Translatour turn∣eth,
Then Hush not, Noble PISO, to protect,
What Gods inspire, and Kings delight to hear.
Thither she gladly flies, and hopes to remain secure, while we are honoured with the calm summer of your gladsome presence here; Where, that joy and safety may alwayes at∣tend your person, Love and Honour
 increase your splendour, Good Fortune and Success crown your Actions, shall be the hearty desire and importunate pray∣er of,
