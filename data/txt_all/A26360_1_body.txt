SIR,
I Have carefully perused these Papers, and though I know not the Author of them, yet seeing you desire my Opinion, I think my self obliged to do them this Right: As for the Matter contained in them, I think it very Orthodox, and fully agreeable with the Do∣ctrine of our Church; and as for the Composure, I think it very Regular and Clear, Judicious and Instructive; and as for the whole, I think it of very great use for all that have honest and teachable Minds, and do sincerely inquire after the Truth, as it is in
 Jesus, but more especially for such as have gone through their Cate∣chize, whose Understandings I doubt not will be very much open∣ed and enlarged by a careful and diligent perusal of it: That God Almighty may prosper the Design of it, and make it a Blessing to the Souls of Men, is the hearty Pray∣er of,
Sir,

From my House in Broadstreet.
