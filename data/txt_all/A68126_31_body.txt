RIght Honourable:
I Know, and in all humility confesse, how weake my Discourse is, and how vnworthy of this diuine subiect, which J haue vnder∣taken; which if an Angell from Heauen should say hee could sufficiently comment vpon, J should distrust him: Yet this let me say (without any vaine boasting) that these thoughts (such as they are) through the blessing of GOD, J haue wouen out of my selfe, as holding it (after our Sauiours rule) better to giue, than to receiue. It is easier to heape together large volumes of others labours, then to worke out lesser of our owne: and the suggestion of one new thought, is better then many re∣peated.
This part (which together with the Author is yours) shall present to your Lordship, the busiest of all the Patriarks, together
 with his tryalls, and successe: wherein you shall see Esau stripped by fraud, of that which he willingly sold, Iacobs hard aduen∣tures for the blessing, and no lesse hard seruices for his wiues and substance, his dangerous encounters ending ioyfully, the rae of his onely daughter, seconded with the trecherous murder of his sonnes, Iudahs wrong to Thamar repayed by his owne vnclean∣nesse: Iosephs sale, imprisonment, honour, pietie; The sinne of his brethren well bestowed, well answered. J so touch at the vses of all these, as one that knowes, it is easie to say more, and impossi∣ble to say enough. GOD giue a blessing to my endeuours, and a pardon to my weakenesse, to your Lordship an encrease of his graces, and perfection of all happinesse.
