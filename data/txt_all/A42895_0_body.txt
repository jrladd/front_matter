Royal Sir,
THe sense which all sober Men, and good Subjects, ever will retain of that Safety and Protection, which the Nation owes to your Princely Wisdom, and true born Courage,

obligeth us to look upon your Royal Person (next to His most Sa∣cred Majesty) as Our Sword, Our Shield, and Our securest Hopes.
You are Our Head in Coun∣cil, and Our Arm in Battel: and as we all ought to fight under your Royal Banner against the force and injuries of a Fo∣reign Foe; so is it Our Duty to oppose no less, the Seditious Conspiracies, and Traiterous Associations, of Our little, malici∣ous scribling Enemies at home.
Amongst many of that de∣ceiving, or deceived Crew, none seems more impudent∣ly extravagant than the Au∣thor

of a Libel call'd Plato Redi∣vivus. The Book it self, with the encouragement which I had to answer it, I received about May last at Paris, from that most Loy∣al and most Worthy Minister, my Lord Preston. What I have been able to do in this little time, I most humbly offer at your Highness's Feet, being fully as∣sured, that your Royal High∣ness will never refuse your Princely Protection to what Per∣son so ever shall sincerely endea∣vour to defend (according to his strength) Our Regal Government with its just Rights, and Preroga∣tives. May Heaven continue

your Royal Person a Blessing to these Kingdoms, to the utmost extent of Providence and Mercy: And may these Nations endea∣vour to deserve so great a Bles∣sing, by an unfeigned Respect, Duty, and Gratitude without limit.
