I Had almost (good Madam) forgotte what I promised, of my self, touching a Book to be Printed, yet at the knit∣ing vp of a tedius tale I remēbred how to keepe promise and a friend, & be∣thought me of som matter pertaining to that cause, waying that light and

slender discourses became not me to offer, nor your La∣dishippe to heare. So happening on a dolefull and tra∣gicall Treatise I preferd it to your reading, knowing that some humor of sorrow or sorrowfull penned matter would be answerable to your graue consistderation, in which discourse following, are numbers of heauie cau∣ses teated on, and touched so narrowlie (with a cleare conceite of the writer) that no one point or other per∣taining to a ruefull rehearsall of troubles, is forgotten. And though the tale seemeth long, the varietie and life of words it bringeth, shall I doubt not shorten the time that is spent in reading, for that euerie passion of mind, trouble of bodie, and disquietnesse of the Soule, is am∣plie and plainelie explained and vnfolded by that which followeth, translated out of another language & taught to speake English to those that vnderstandeth the heauie haps of such, as haue fallen into misfortune, so knitting vp my Booke with this discourse, I expresse the matter I haue spoken of.
