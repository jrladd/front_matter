NOble Sir, I know your in∣nate
goodnes is such, that
you cannot contemne this
well intended Abstract,
though gathered by an
infirme hand, considering, it reporteth the
difficult Embassie of no lesse person than
your most ennobled Grandfather, my dred
Lord, from whose sage steps, when our
King shall please to invite you, to give

Caesar a second visit, you may the better
know the way, and be secured from many
imminent dangers by such a provident
care: pardon me, deare Sir, that I make
your choice tendernesse my Patron (since
the Discourse is no more pleasing) my
aimes and endeavours being all bent to
serve you; and therefore the effects must
needs be yours: truly Sir, your early be∣ginnings
promise such a rare proceeding,
that you seeme to anticipate your age by
out-stripping time in your wisedome and
sweet discretion, And if I may obtaine
your beloved smiles in this bold, though ho∣nest,
action, I shall not feare what the
sharpe jerke of any malignant tongue can
doe unto me, but will glory in my Cha∣racter,
Happy Servant in such a Ma∣ster,
