Madam,
TO render an acknowledgement
of those great engagements and
duties which J shall ever owe
to the illustrious memory of that
most serene and truely honourable
Lady your deare deceased Sister,
to whom you were as neerely al∣lied
in vertue as in blood, J humbly present these mo∣dest
Elegies to salute your mayden palmes: Not onely
mine, but the generally received opinion, of her most con∣spicuous

worth, and honour hath importuned me (who
was her most unworthy beneficiary) to undertake the
performance of this service; and the unstained candour
of your noble disposition perswades me not to despaire of
your gracious acceptance.
