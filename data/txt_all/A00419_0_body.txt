HOw euer the greatnesse of your
place, or the necessitie of the
times, may challenge your ver∣tue
(most Noble Lord) to bee
wholy taken vp, in the contem∣plation
of high, and serious af∣faires,
as ambitious or couetous
to enjoy a full and absolute
man, and making euery thing

your most Noble and Heroical Father, as the gift of a

learned and well experienced Gentleman, who in the tran∣slation,
tooke a long and well-meriting labour; it must needs
then, now be yours, both by order and inheritance. And
though when it came to kisse his hand, it was all French, ex∣cept

and some were fearefull how to vse a knowledge so diffe∣ring
from their practise: yet now it is put into other gar∣ments,
and how homely soeuer the stuffe be; yet it is cut with
that art and iudgement, that without doubt, it will both en∣dure
the wearing, and become any Husbandman of
this Kingdome; or the other, who were first breeders
of the same: to whose particular profit I leaue
it, and my slfe euer to bee dispo∣sed
