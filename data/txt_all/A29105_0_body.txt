Most Reverend and Honoured,
I Humbly present to you this, with the following Discourses, which I Publish in Obedience to your Order, and with my thankful acknowledgment of the Honour you have done me, in appointing me your Lecturer for the Year ensuing.
The best way of establishing any Truth is, by mak∣ing a fair and just Representation of it, Truth being to the Mind, what Light is to the Eye, al∣ways discernable, where there is no defect in the Organ. My design therefore is, to endeavour so to represent
the Christian Revelation, that it may appear by it's own Light, and by that means, as far as may be, to prevent Objections, before they are rais'd. And be∣cause I am fully perswaded, that the true Cause of Infidelity, where the Gospel is publish'd, is some vi∣tious Indisposition in the Minds of men, I thought it expedient to begin with laying down the Qualifica∣tions, which are necessary for such Persons, as shall concern themselves about this Subject.
I am very sensible of my want of Ability, propor∣tionable to this Ʋndertaking: but I humbly beseech that God and Saviour, in whose Cause I am engag'd, to enable me in some measure to promote the pious and generous Design of our Honourable Founder, a Person who convinc'd the World, that Christianity is consistent with excellent natural Parts, and great Learning; as well as with noble Birth, and good Breeding. After this I have nothing farther to do, but to rely upon that Goodness which so freely employ'd me, favourably to interpret the Endeavours of,
Most Reverend and Honoured,
