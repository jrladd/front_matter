Madam,
YOƲ might upon the first view condemn this Oblation (coming so late) as unvoluntary; and therefore unacceptable; did it not bring with it an Apology, which common charity cannot refuse, the truth is, this Poem hath strug∣gled for life with no less opposition than Mortality it selfe; the honest Printer who undertook to give it birth, dying in the very act of its Delivery: where it hath remained these three weeks wrapt in a dead mans sheet, striving for birth like one of those preternatural Issues of the Sun upon the slime of Nilus, part shaped and alive, part without forme or motion, and it had deservedly expired with him, had it not born in the Front of it two sacred Signatures of my duty to Her Majesty, and my respect to Your Ladiship. You must needs beg me the Queens pardon for being guilty of an innocent Homicide, for Her Majesties sake; vvhich accident hath added to my presumption. What the Ambi∣tion of others aims at in their high addresses, I shall not determine; whenever I put on Eagles wings, the Augury of my design is (the natural effect of distance) by soaring high to lessen my own merits, and magnifie my obligations. And although I never had the honor to be related to those noble Families the Shrewsburies and Brudenals (now in a happy conjunction) yet when I hear the high Expressions of both from a Brother and a Sister, I cannot be unconcern'd in their

Before she solemniz'd your auspicious Nuptials: perhaps the dress of that Poem might, the subject could not be trou∣blesom, which was so pleasing to your Ladyship. At this time my Muse celebrates the new espousals of a Royal Wid∣dow to her Crown, I wish I could say to her King. Now though your Ladyship be entertain'd in the Porch, the De∣dication of this Poem; yet the fabrick, namely the Sub∣ject, is part of her Majesties Revenue; unto whom I need no nearer Access than your Ladyship, your person being as near the Queen as her shadow to her Body, or rather as her Body to her Head; joyn'd not onely by propinquity, but by influence also. And now; Madam, I have unbosom'd my whole design, which is, that the world by me, and her Ma∣jesty by you may knovv, how much I am her Majesties loyal Subject, and
