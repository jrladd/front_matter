Sir,
I Doe so far presume of your favor as to shelter these insuing Lines under the shadow of your Prote∣ction. J, indeed, acknowledge my boldnesse in thus intruding upon your worth, to defend my weake∣nesse.
Notwithstanding, J am herein incouraged in part to presume of your Pardon. The slender subject here presented to your view, consists of two parts, Passi∣on, and Discretion: The first part, which is Pas∣sion, that is absolutely mine owne: an inheritance dis∣cending from most auncient Parentage. The other, which is Discretion, is yours by Possession; and due

by Desert: in which J doe but bring the shadow to your Sight, of that which you have the substance in your selfe. In which respect it is but my duty to inti∣tle you to that which is yours by due. Jn which kind also, not onely that which insues, but that which is precedent may begge your Patronage, as part of your Inheritage.
J doe confesse J have imprinted the name of that noble Lady Temperance in the front of my Endea∣vours; but J know you will account it no disgrace to part with so worthy a partner; whose beauties, J am confident, doe (if possibly they may do) As much delight your heart, as the alone Lady of your affecti∣ons, doth your bosome: which can no way be impu∣ted to wantonnesse, but to wisdome. For what can be of more validity to preserve the nuptiall knot invi∣olate, then the sacred tye of vertuous Temperance?
But, not any way to direct, but onely to delight you, J have thus farre incroached upon your leave. And in Fine, humbly petitioning for your favour, J rest Yours at Command, as bound.
