Whom God hath honoured for his Almoners, And, Sanctified to be his Dispensers of the fruits of Charity and Mercy To Mee, In this my necessitous and decrepit Old age, I humbly PRESENT This Testimony of my Thankfulnesse: WITH My incessant Apprecations to the Father of all Mercies, to reward them for it in this life, and to crown their Souls with everlasting Joy and Glory, in the life to come, Through JESUS CHRIST our Lord.
Amen.
