Madam,
THese Lines esteem it a great part of their Happiness, that they may but prostrate themselves to your service: I know your experience can over-act an hear-say Testimonial to the Truth of Martha Taylor's amazing Story. This poor Attempt of mine may contribute some∣thing to your Remembrance, though very little to your Information; for you have seen and searcht into this wonder∣ful Abstinent; you are well skill'd in Nature, and in the puzling Architecture of the Humane Body, as your judicious, prosperous, and charitable Applications

do sufficiently and frequently demon∣strate; and then, which is your greatest glory, you are well acquainted with the urgent Business, and profound Con∣cerns of another World. Your more than ordinary Candor, free Entertain∣ment and numerous Courtesies con∣ferr'd upon (immeritorious) Me, when I did twice or thrice visit your Country to take a view of this wonderful, aerial, foodless Creature, hath begot this Pre∣sentment, or, may I call it, mean and bar∣ren, Remuneration, from him who is, and will be
March 30. 1669.
