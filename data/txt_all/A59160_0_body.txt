Madam,
GIve me leave, I beseech you, to present you with this Copy of a Master-piece, drawn in its Originall by as rare a hand as I have met withall; the which I am the rather encouraged to doe, for that I have experien∣ced your Goodnesse to be such, as may make

me presume upon your Pardoning such Faults as your Iudicious eye shall observe therein, e∣specially since they are committed by so Profest and so Obliged a Servant of your La∣diships: and further, for that All that have the Honor to know you, know you to have Piety enough to practice what is therein pre∣scribed as allowed of, and to shun the Contrary (both which you will finde Rarely drawn to the life by the Authour, though perhaps but Slubberd over by the Copyer, in almost every Chapter of this book) Loyaltie enough not to transgresse the boundaries therein prae∣scribed to due Allegeance, and to detest the severall Revolts you shall finde mentioned therein; Iudgement enough to discern, and I hope to approve of the Eloquence, Philo∣sophy, History, and Divinity, which you shall see therein Handsomely and Methodically in∣terwoven: to which if you will adde Cha∣rity enough (a vertue so Eminent in your Ladiship, as it is not to be Doubted of) to pardon the faults escaped in the Presse, I shall thread it to the rest of my Obligations;

since though they cannot in a Direct line be imputed to Me, yet by Reflection (as not having had a sufficient Care to peruse the Proofes) they may seem to have an Influ∣ence upon Me; to which I must plead, my not being in Town whilest the Presse went, and that I have made an Amends by printing an Errata, which I shall desire whosoever buyes this book, to see bound up with it for his better satisfaction.
Madam,
When to this Goodnes, Piety, Loyalty, Iudge∣ment and Charity, the Honour shall be added which you derive from that Noble Stock whence you are Immediately descended, and that which you atcheive from that Antient Stock of Honour into which you are so happi∣ly Engrafted, I hope that my Choise of Dedi∣cation will by all men be approved of: and I shall think my Labour very well Bestowed and Highly Recompenced, if your Ladiship shall please to peruse this Rough-hewn Coppy at such Leasure-houres as I pend it; and if you

shall find anything therein which may make you thinke your Time that meane while not Mis-spent; or which may sometimes bring the Humblest of your Servants into your Thoughts, He shall have obtained the Height of his Ambition, who is,
Madam
