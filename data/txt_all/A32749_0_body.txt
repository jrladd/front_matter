Right Honourable,
AT the last Impression of this Work, in way of hum∣ble
Duty and Thankfulness, I presented to Your Ho∣nour
certain Collections and Observations upon Chau∣cer;
as namely, His Life, Picture, and Pedigree:
the Arguments of every Book and Tale: the Explanation of old
Words, with Declaration of Authors by him cited: and also
two Treatises, the Death of Blanch, called his Dream: and
the Flower and the Leaf, never before printed. But as these
things then through want of time were not fully perfected, so
were there some other things omitted, at the next Impression to
be performed.
Now therefore, that both by old written Copies, and by
Mr. William Thynn's praise-worthy Labours, I have re∣formed
the whole Work, whereby Chaucer, for the most part,
is restored to his own Antiquity; and noted withal most of
his Sentences and Proverbs; having also, with some Addi∣tions,
reduced into due place those former Notes and Collecti∣ons;
as likewise proved the Significations of most of the old and
obscure Words, by the Tongues and Dialects from whence they
are derived; translated also into English, all the Latin and

French by him used; and lastly, added to his Works some
Things of his own doing, as the Treatise of Jack Upland
against Fryars, and his A. B. C. commonly called La Priere
de nostre Dame: I am bold to present the whole to your Ho∣nourable
Favour and Patronage, always mindful of my bounden
Duty to Your Honour's House, which with hearty Prayer I
commend to the Grace of the Almighty.
