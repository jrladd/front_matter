Madame,
IT is as much beyond the height of my ambition to requite, as the extent of my abilities to deserve, that favorable eye of re∣spect, your Honour hath beene pleased to cast upon me, ever since I was first knowne to you. A thankefull ac∣knowledgement whereof (I know) is all your Honour doth expect, or I can pay.
And now it fares with me, as with some Tradesmen that prove banquerupt, who when they have run so farre in debt, that they needs must breake, their grand designe is to get still further into debt, not caring then how much they owe, since they can ne∣ver pay. If therefore your Honour will bee pleased to adde unto the former score of my engagements, the acceptance of this tender of my service in this Translation, and call it yours, you much oblige mee in bond, which I shall never seeke to cancell. I know its first admission into your Honours closet, and welcome there, will so credit it, that it will find the freer accesse to all my Countries La∣dies and Gentlewomen, for whose sakes e∣specially I undertooke this taske. I thought it pitty that so learned, juditious and use∣full a booke, for the information of their judgements, & amendment of their Errours, should passe without their cognizance. In triviall matters an Errour is lesse dange∣rous; But in Physick, being a noble Sci∣ence, conversant about such a noble subject
as the body of man, Errours are more pal∣pable, especially when they are growne vul∣gar and popular, tending to the generall harme of the Microcosme. I here present your Honour with a literall interpretation of such of them, as have beene already ob∣served by my learned Authour, wherein he hath so elegantly discussed them, that he hath deservedly gained much credit among the Learned, although indeed the booke doth more concerne the vulgar and unlearned, whose Errours it doth detect. Pardon, I pray my boldnesse, and accept this offering, from
Madame 
Novemb. 30th 1650.
