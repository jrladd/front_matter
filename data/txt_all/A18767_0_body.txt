THe fatherlye and faithfull maner of your diuine Do∣ctrine (M. Deane,) with the blotlesse life you lead (soū∣ded by the vniuersal report of good people) made mee often desirous to dedicate some labour of mine, to the protectiō of your sound iudge∣ment. And now pricked forward by Gods mightie motion (and maruellous workes of late) to bestowe a fewe verses to a vertuous personage, in a vitious world & dangerous season, I haue chosen you among a multi∣tude, to sounde out the trumpet of Gods glorie, and to giue passage to the playnesse of my pen, and willing paines I haue taken: Not as though my wordes or inuention (voide of depe profundity) might aduance any waye the high maiestie of God, or fur∣ther the good Fame you haue gotten. But being in humility of minde, loking to the basenesse of this world, and meannes of my

calling, (vnfurnished both of heauenly gifts & worldly good fortunes) I presumed tho∣row my pen and studie, to purchase you a friend, and reclaime the enimies of God to come home to their consciences, and looke on the wonders of the Lorde, that dayly is working amōg his louing people. So ney∣ther meaning to flatter (where tender eares can abyde no doublenesse) nor stretche out a bare Epistle, with a long discourse of bor∣rowed wordes, I betake you to the almigh∣tie, committing that followes (this simple short Scedule) to the great and good consideration of your Wisdome. From my lodging this eight of April. Your wel willer al∣wayes at commaunde∣ment.
