Dear Children,
THE good old Patriarch Jacob, constrained in his later days to live in a strange Country, considered the manner how to make himself happy, and to bless his Children before his death; Such were the thoughts of my heart, in these sad distracted times, when, in the decli∣nation of my age, I was inforced to eat my bread in forein parts; where, having abandoned the thorny cares, and troubled cogitations of world∣ly imployments, some way to alienate the weight of my pressing afflictions, I resolved by studious endevours to find the right and true way to my eternal habitation, and heavenly Country as it is manifested in the book of God, which although alsufficient every way for mans salvation; yet I omitted not to cast mine eyes on such objects, as might prove helps to discover the clearest and easiest paths for my better conduct thereunto, to which end amongst other books, I translated this treatise intituled the Love of God, Compiled in Spanish by the learned Chri∣stopher De Fonseca.
This when I had finished, and considered that
the generall subject of the whole work was love, and the severall parts thereof might tend to the better ordering of a Godly, Moral and Ci∣vil life, I knew not unto whom more fitly to recommend it, as the Legacy of a dying man, then to you my dear children, the living Cions of my Corporall stock, and the comfortable cares of my drooping age, and this I do the rather be∣queath unto you, as confident that you like Noahs good children, will not onely turn your own eyes from your fathers nakedness (in this his undertaking) but as much as in you is, la∣bour to cover the same from others.
But that which especially invites me to address this tract unto you, is that you may not only be put in minde (so far as God shall inable you) to imitate your father, in Holy Love, whereby I may seem to revive and live again in you, but that making your selves first Scholars and followers, and then having your hearts repleni∣shed with the Spirit of Love, and your feet con∣ducted in the right paths of Charity you may be∣come guides of others unto the heavenly Canaan.
After which as my soul ever longed, move then after all earthly goods, worldly contents or fleshly delights, so that herein you may imitate and exceed me your father, is the ear∣nest desire, hearty counsel and most fervent prayer of
