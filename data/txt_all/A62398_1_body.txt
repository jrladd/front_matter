THis Book, good Sir, the Issue of my Brain,
Though far unworthy of your worthy view,
In hope ye gently it will intertain,
Yet I in duty offer it to you;
Although the Method and the Phrase be plain,
Not Art, like Writ, as to the Stile is due,
And truth I know your favour will obtain;
The many favours I have had from you,
Hath forc'd me thus to show my thankful Mind,
And of all faults I know no vice so bad,
And hateful as ungratefully inclin'd;
A thankful Heart is all a poor mans Wealth,
Which with this Book I give your worthy self:
I humbly crave your Worthiness excuse,
This boldness of my poor unlearned Muse,
That hath presum'd so high a pitch to fly,
In praise of Vertue and Gentility:
I know this Task's most fit for learned men,
For Homer, Ovid, or for Virgil's Pen;
These Lines I have presum'd to Dite,
It's known to your Honour I could never Write.
