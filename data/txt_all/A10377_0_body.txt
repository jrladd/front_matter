O WORLD!
THou seest what Contradiction these poor weak Sermons
have met withall; how they have been, and are accu∣sed
of falshood, envy, malice, peevishness: that the
Magistrates are standered in them; and very lies ut∣tered
in the face of City, and Country. I am necessitated to ap∣peal
to God, and the World. O World I hold forth unto thy
view faithfully all that was ken, nothing omitted. I call unto
thee, to be my true and impartial witness: and let the God of
Truth be Iudg!
