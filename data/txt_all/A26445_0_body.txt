Worthy Gentlemen,
YOur voluntary entrance into this Loyal Band, is as great a Speci∣men (methinks) of your parti∣cular Valours, as that of lapping the Waters amongst (a) Gideons Souldiers, when he was to fight the Midianites, and to shew you how ignorant your Adversaries are in the design of the holy Writ, like their Forefa∣thers of Rebellion that mistook the Text of (b) Curse ye Meroz, when they went out like Fools and Knaves to help the Lord a∣gainst the Mighty,) they upbraid to you, for∣sooth, the (a) paucity of your Numbers, (in an

empty Libel) which alone shews you to be un∣der the Banners of the Lord of Hosts, who re∣duced the Armies of Two and thirty thousand to Three hundred, because they were too many for him to overcome by: You are those few (my hearts) pickt out on purpose to doe his Won∣ders, at whose first sight the late (d) Sharer of the Government marched off with his ragged Regiment, like a nasty Fog, before the Sun ascending to his Meridian, or Oreb and Zeeb, before the Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon, for they (and none other) can be truly said to wield either of those Weapons, but men in your Circumstances, commissioned by your Liege-Lord (who alone has power to grant them) for your so doing.

You've broke your Pitchers, shewn your Lights,
And by your Stratagems, the Midianites,
(Those giddy Mists) are vanisht from your Plain;
You! like Apollo, have the Python slain,
In honour of whose Name the Pythean Plays
Were typically Acted, for your Rays,
Like the Repentance of King Pharaoh's mind,
Dismiss those Frogs and Lice from Egypts kind.


(e) Hinc illae Lachrimae—
Ab hoc fonte derivata simultas
In Regem regiménque fluxit.

I am informed that (f) Six or Seven empty Bottles at first, one of which is since crackt, and another quite broken, clubb'd to the ma∣king up of One Billingsgate Logerhead, and he advised a Painter very scurrilously, and dully, to traduce you all in general, and par∣ticularly those of the first rate amongst you: I confess, ever since that senseless Ribaldry came to my view, I have been disputing which of Solo∣mon's Advices to follow, whether to answer a Fool in his Folly, or not, were the best way to appear in your vindication. But upon better thoughts, I have advised a Painter (in the ensuing Poem) to exhibit such Calumniators in their Colours; that the World may see what sort of People those Opposers of Government are called out on; the ignorance and scurrility of whom, I am so great a hater of, that I have avoided treading in their steps, by particulari∣zing either Place, or Person: so that none but the guilty (who ought to suffer) can be offended at it; yet they also may escape the punishment if they have the Wit to hold their Tongues, for when one Rogue is described amongst a thou∣sand Persons, who but a Fool will declare himself to be the Man, by quarrelling with the Painter for his draught: it follows then, that a Man

may be a Knave unknown to his Neighbours, if he cunningly carries it off by Silence; but if he uncovers himself by Passion, then we must conclude him a Fool, and a Knave too, and so I'le leave him, for
Nemo me impunè lacessit.
Gentlemen, I shall use no other Argument to perswade your Acceptance of this Dedication, but to tell you, it was design'd to expose the King's and your Enemies; and Written by one that honours your Design, loves your Persons, and (as you are all Sons of the Church of England) is
