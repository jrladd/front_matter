MY LORD,
I Could not without injustice, have dedicated this Book to any but your Lordship, be∣cause, as there is no person to whom I am so much obliged, so there is no member of either House of

Parliament that hath so freely and generously owned the Protestant interest. As for my obligations to your Lordship, because they are too great to be exprest, it is my du∣ty to take all occasions of expres∣sing my thankfulness for them, and therefore I take this occasion to proclaim my thankfulness to the World. As for your Lordships late owning the Protestant interest in the House of Peers, it was so emi∣nent, and accompanied with such zeal and courage, that (next under God, and the King) your Lordship may deservedly be stiled the chief asserter and promoter of it, and con∣sequently the asserter and promoter of the interest of England. For the interest of the Protestant Religion,

and the interest of this Kingdom, are so interwoven, that the welfare or ruine of either, is the welfare or ruine of both. Now being obli∣ged by your Lordship, both as an English Protestant, and also more particularly in my private capacity, I beseech God to grant that your life may be long and prosperous, your memory and posterity honourable, as long as the Sun and Moon shall endure, and your soul and body eternally happy, when time shall be no more. To this Prayer I shall only add, that I am unfeignedly,
My Lord,
