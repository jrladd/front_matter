FOr the shril Trumpet and sterne Tragick sounds,
Objects out-ragious and so full of feare;
Our Pen late steep'd in English Barons wounds,
Sent war-like accents to your tune-full eare.
Our actiue Muse to gentler Morals dight;
Her slight conceits, in humbled tunes doth sing;
And with the Bird (regardlesse of the light)
Slowely doth moue her late high-mounting wing.
The wreathe is Iuye that ingirts our browes,
Where-in this Nights-Bird harboreth all the day:
We dare not looke at other Crowning boughes,
But leaue the Lawrell vnto them that may.
Lowe as the earth, though our Inuention moue:
High yet as heauen (to you) our spotles loue.
