SIR,
SInce most Men act by
Interest, as I do here
endeavour to shew, it
may be in all likelihood sup∣pos'd,
that in Dedicating
this Book to you, I am my
self guilty of the very same
thing I reproach in every

Article to others: Which
indeed I cannot flatly deny,
if Interest oblige us, as un∣doubtedly
it does, to be
grateful to such as we are
most, or rather, only indebt∣ed
to. But besides this parti∣cular
Reason relating to my
private duty to you, I was up.
on another account resolved
at last to prefix your Name
before these Papers, because
the World easily allowing
you to act always by a ge∣nerous
Principle, and not by
Interest, it cannot be thought
that I intend to give Sentence

against you, when I condemn
the generality of Mankind;
and tho I seem to say some∣where,
That the Publick
Good is the advantage you
propose to your self in all
your Learned and Excel∣lent
Wtitings, yet this being
a thing in it self highly com∣mendable,
you have no rea∣son
to think your self wrong'd
by such an unusual reproach,
since 'tis by pursuing eagerly
this very kind of Interest that
you are deservedly styl'd e∣very
where, and particular∣ly
abroad, Philosophus Bri∣tannicus,

the English Philo∣sopher;
which Title, so glo∣rious
to your Self, to your
Countrey, and to your No∣ble
Family, that you may in
all Health and Prosperity
long enjoy, is the hearty
wish,
SIR,
