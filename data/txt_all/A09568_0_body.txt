CAlling to mynde (right honorable) the bonde that Nature hath layd as it were vpon euery mans shulder: to wit, that eche man to his po∣wer and abilitie, should diligently labour to benefite his natiue countrey. I thought it therefore my bounden dutye, to gratifie your Lordship at this present, and also (as proceding from your honour) the residue of my countrey men, with this my simple labour. Whiche though many might haue done it better, yet I haue done my good wyll: being not only incited and encouraged therevnto, by the vulgare report of your clementie and gratefull accep∣ting of diuers other mens labours in such lyke enterprises: but also by the worthines of the worke and splendent fame of the authour, whose worthy Chronicle as touching the estate of religion and the weale publike vnder the Emperour Char¦les the fifte, for as muche as the custodie thereof in our En∣glishe tongue was exhibited vnto your honour, I thought I could not chose a more fitter Patron for this litle booke, then him who had alreadie (by thankfull accepting of the foresaide Chronicle) declared his good will to the Authour. To make discourse vnto your Lordship concerning the goodnes and ex∣cellentnes thereof, and the benefite that may therefrom re∣dounde vnto all such as are studious. I thynke I shuld (as the prouerbe is) but powre water into the sea, for as much as the same is farre better described in the authours own preface, as also the causes that moued him to take in hand the same, then I should haue bene able to haue penned it. Not withstanding this much I may well say with Thucidides, that amonges all other writtyngs histories is a treasure, which neuer ought to
be out of our hands, to the end that being ayded thereby, we might the better handle such lyke busynesses and chaunces in the common weales: for albeit that the persons are chaunged and haue geuen place to nature, yet the same or the lyke ac∣cidents and chaunces happen dayly. Yea I maye boldly af∣firme that it much auayleth them that be in authoritie, to marke diligently in the reading of histories, the actes of all ages, to the end that they hauing examples layed before their eyes both of good and euyll regiment, and of the blessing of God vpon good gouernours, and of the iuste wrathe of God diuersly powred vppon the contrary sort, may learne to folow the good and eschewe the euyll. Nowe briefely to finishe, my humble request is, first that it wold please you to accept in no worse part this my simple and smale offer, then as the present of one that earnestly wisheth you all felicitie, who woulde haue geuen better, yf his abilitie had to his good wyll bene correspondant: and consequently to pardon my boldnes, and to beare with the rudenesse of my style. And in so doing I shal thynke my selfe not onely much bound vnto your honour, but also be earnestly moued to praye vnto God to maintaine you in your estate, to prosper and further all your good purposes, to encrease you in vertue, and keepe you in good health and prosperitie.
