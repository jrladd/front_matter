MY LORD,
THAT this weake birth newly delivered from the straites of the press, should as soone as got out thence, be directed to your Lordship to beg your blessing and protection, will not, I hope, seeme a matter of too great presumption. It was by your Lordships encouragement thither first committed, and being at last thence come forth, whither should it with greater confidence betake it self, than to your Lordship? It hath so long there continued, that it may deserve that censure of our Prophet to Ephraim (c. 13.13.) that surely it is an unwise child, or otherwise it would not have staid so long in the place of the breaking forth of children. By this means it hath grown to more than ordinary bulk and bigness, but whether with vigor and spirits proportionable, I know
not; what it wants in that kinde, the only hope is that it may acquire from the influence of your Lordships favour, by which animated and encouraged it will dare farther to adventure into the open aire of the world. But, my Lord, it likewise brings another errand with it, which is to con∣gratulate the publick benefit of your Lordships late reco∣very, with hearty prayers that God would perfect and long preserve to your Lordship health and life, for glory to him, and good to this Church. This message it humbly craves leave to present from,
MY LORD, 
August 20. 1685.
