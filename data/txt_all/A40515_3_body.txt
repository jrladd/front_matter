MADAM,
YOur esteem of, and favour to the Author of these Sermons, hath made me presume to shroud them under your Patronage, as well to give some countenance to them, as to testifie my real Gratitude for your favours to me and mine. Such are your excellent Vertues and Endowments; your pie∣tie to God, and devotion in his service; your charitie to all, and bountie to the poor; your care and diligence in well-ordering, and good education of your Family; insomuch as not onely of your Children, but all your Children, are found walking in the Truth: that I cannot think by these to adde any thing to your present
 perfection. I offer them to you, as poor men bring presents to the rich: if they may carrie ac∣ceptance from you, and bring profit to any soul, it shall abundantly satisfie me. Two main du∣ties of a Christian are the subject of them, Re∣deeming the Time, and Profiting by the Word, in both which you are exemplarie to others, and so the fittest Patroness for these Sermons: I therefore humbly betake them to your Protecti∣on, and you to the Protection of the Almightie: to whose Grace you, and yours, are daily com∣mended in the weak prayers of,
MADAM,
