more fit to countenaunce it, which al∣though it shall happen to endure the ma∣licious cauiles of the enemies of Gods trueth, as the Author himselfe is well knowne to haue tasted: yet so much the lesse shall the enemie boast of his wicked¦nesse, when he seeth stampt in the fore∣head of this little Booke, the noble name of him, who is and euer hath beene a re∣fuge to the Godly, & from time to time a ready defender, to imbolden them in such excellent studies. As for the reue∣rend Father that tooke first the paynes to translate them, I doubt not but he was well knowne to your honour, and for his sake, I hope they shall be the bet∣ter welcome: and for my selfe, bothe the cause that mooued mee to enter into this boldnes, and the affection I haue continually borne to your honour, in this small gift I referre all to your honorable construction, desiring God to blesse you night and day, in all you goe about.
