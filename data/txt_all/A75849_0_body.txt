THis Discourse (Lords and Com∣mons of England) deserves, and desires your perusal and Patron∣age: It deserves the former, forasmuch as the welbeing of the Common wealth, is therein much concerned; it desires the latter, as being like to meet with such measure as he met with, who found cause to say to the reverend and learn∣ned sons of Abraham, that sate in Moses Chair; Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God. If it seem in some places knotty; be pleased to remember, the Author was an Italian, to which Nation, sub∣tilty in reasoning, seems natural, and let the goodness of the Kernel, excuse the hardness of the Shell. If any particular persons, or any
 sort of men now upon the Stage, shall seem to be pointed at herein, be pleased to take no∣tice, that it is now eighty four yeers since this Treatise was penned. It hath been twice or thrice Printed beyond the Seas in the Original Latine, and once in this Kingdom. This is the first time it hath endevored to speak English. If this essay shall finde acceptance, the Translator intends to go in hand with the remaining Books, God affording life and opportunity. In the mean time and ever, his humble and hearty suit, to the mighty Councellor and Prince of Peace, shall be; that he will be pleased by his Spirit, to be present at all your Consultations, and to grant, That forasmuch as you have hi∣therto prudently steered the Ship of the Com∣mon-wealth through tempestuous Seas, and magnanimously defended the same against the Assaults of many cunning, strong and furious Pirates; You may not come to let her split upon the shore, but that she may be by you safely landed in the fair Haven of Righteousness and Peace.
