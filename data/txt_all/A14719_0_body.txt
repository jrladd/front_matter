SIr, if the greatnes of your worth
can extend it selfe to the lownes
of this discourse, or the dignitie
of your curtesie (in accepting
my loue) proue a counterscale to my pre∣sumption
and bouldnes, you shall engraue
in mens mindes the nobilitie of your hum∣blenes,
& fortifie my endeuours to inheigh∣ten
your name and memory. To be a Pa∣tron
(although but to a begger) is the office
of a King, and to be a protector of the mea∣nest,
I doubt not  well become the
Magistrate.  that induced me to
select you from  of the worthy,
whose wisedomes like firme bases are the vp∣houlders

of our peace, is not onely that your
merit stands transparent with the highest,
but that you being as it were ētring into the
Temple, where Iustice hath her sacrifices,
and your selfe aduancing your self vp those
degrees of dignity, at the foot of which, of∣ēses
shalbe corrected & the offenders cut off,
you may but in looking ouer this litle body,
be remembred, how vgly vice lookes, how
deformed she seemes without, and how
loathsome she is within: so that when the
edge of authority shalbe put into your hand,
you may giue this corruption such a blow,
that her power shallsinke, like the name of
the wicked, not worthy to be remembred,
& her sinewes be so infeebled, that she shal
neuer renue her strength to haue foot a∣gaine,
wherein if I plaid the bad workeman,
and that this picture be not drawne out to
the life, I beseech, you le your countinance
be as a curtaine to shade it from the con∣tempt
of the world  painter is stu∣dying
how to lay , the glory
of which, shall  vnderstanding,
and be of you receiued, as thought worthy
of your eyes.
