MADAM,
WHEN I sent you this Poem in Manuscript (an account how I spend my time; being a Tribute you always exact from me) you were pleas'd to return it with a very harsh Request that I should Print it. I cannot hinder my self from saying, that it is somewhat Tyranical, and very much like the French Monarch, who imposeth a fresh Gabelle upon his Vassals, when they are burden'd with Taxes sufficiently before; but since you have provok'd me to be an Author, I'le assure you it is at your own peril, for I'le haunt you with Panegyrick, and tease you with the Commendation of your self: Nay, I could pursue my Revenge farther, by pulling off your Mask, and discovering to the world who you are; and so make a reprisal upon your Modesty for disturbing my Solitude. If I follow'd the common Mode of Dedications, I should declare, That all the scatter'd Excellencies of your Sex are united in your single Self; which like the Sun-beams contracted in a Burning-glass, forbid too familiar an approach: But there must be a distance to allay the brightness, that it may be a gentle, and to me, MADAM, I hope a most auspicious Influence: however I can affirm with great truth, That your Complexion is of the first and most ela∣borate blush, not farded with Art, but a genuine native mix∣ture; and your Genius is as refin'd as your Person: You are neither a Coquette nor a Precieuse; neither a vain Talker, nor an affected Wit: I only fear that your enjoyning the Pub∣lication of this Trifle, will be the first time that ever your Judgment was called in question. Whilst other Ladies are taken up with their Toilette and Looking-glass, you are em∣ploy'd in reading the best Authors; and not only so, but in an happy Imitation of them: This your several Composures would manifest to the world, if you would think them worthy to see the light; but you are obstinate against all Solicitations of that
nature; so that it must be a Posthumous work, and the care of an Executor. But let me tell you, MADAM, you in the mean while defraud the World of what would benefit and enrich it, and we shall cast but a doleful regard upon the Copy when the Original is gone: I know not any One to whom these Verses may be more properly apply'd, than to your self.
Non tu Corpus eras sine pectore, Dii tibi formam
Dii tibi divitias dederint artemque fruendi.
I am very sensible, MADAM, of the absurdity to speak Latin in a Ladies presence, but I am sure you understand it; and for the sake of those who do not, I will translate them after my way, that is somewhat Paraphrastically.
MADAM, the Gods did smile when you were Born,
And you an Heavenly Beauty doth adorn;
You with a Mind as elegant are blest,
The House is suited to the noble Guest;
A Soul degenerate doth not it disgrace,
(Like a Brass Watch within a Silver Case)
And Jove doth court you in a Golden Shower,
Into your Lap doth mighty Treasures pour;
And you profusely don't the Gifts employ,
You have the Art those Riches to enjoy.
Your Charity, MADAM, as it is very diffusive, so it is that of the best kind; which conveys Relief privately to the afflicted: You don't make a pompous invitation of the Poor into your great Hall, where they eat with constraint, and tremble under their Benefactors: this is not to succor but expose their Wants; like a shallow River it makes a noise with Ostenta∣tion; but your Bounty spreads in Cascade, and is very gentle in its descent: 'tis like a refreshing Dew that falls silently, and in the Night. Tho' some affirm that Wit and Courage are inconsistent; yet in you, MADAM, they are reconcil'd; and you are Heroical as well as Ingenuous: For give me leave to remember, That upon the first Landing of our Glorious KING, you were touch'd with a more than ordinary Joy; nay, You once resolv'd to do that Honor to our Sex, by dissembling your Own, as to disguise your self En Cavalier, and go in to the Prince: Then, MADAM, you would have appear'd like the Goddess of Wisdome, with your Spear and Shield; or like another Boadicia, Fighting against Romans too, in vindication of your injur'd Country. You always had an untainted pro∣spect
of Affairs, and foretold that the heat Things were push'd up to, would end either in absolute Slavery, or a mighty Deliver∣ance; and the success hath justified the better part of the Augury: For whilst this poor Nation was in the last defail∣ances of Spirit, NASSAU, like a good Samaritan, pour'd a Sovereign Balsome into her Wounds; and restor'd a distress'd and almost an abandon'd Church, which had fall'n into the hands not only of Forreign, but Domestick Thieves: Amongst many others which I could name, this is a conspicuous instance of your Prudence; that when you liv'd in a place where the Genius of it is Calumny, and where Weeds only thrive and grow luxuriant, but there's a Malignity in the Air which de∣stroys all generous Plants; yet even there the most envious and inquisitive had nothing to object to your Conduct: Nay once, MADAM, you fell Sick, and they did not count it a Judg∣ment, tho' this is their usual way of executing their Piques; they will wound you in the most sensible parts of your Fortune and Reputation, and then entitle Heaven to their own Treache∣ry and Malice: There was but one time wherein I heard you but so much as slightly tax'd, and that was when a celebrated Man for voice and gesture, like a travelling Shower, came to spend his Tropes and Figures upon an Audience where you were in, when the rest of your Sex were in Tears your Eyes were observ'd to be dry: Yet this did not proceed from want of tenderness in your Temper, but it was an effect of your Judgment; for you distinguish'd the Enthusiast from the true Orator: You have often declaim'd against this rapturous way of talking, as the most frivolous, so the easiest attainment possi∣ble; for the Man of this talent when he is a little put to it for sense, he hath alwaies recourse to warm Topicks in re∣serve, which bring him in again. Methought you compar'd an extempore Harangue very prettily to weak Wine upon the fret, which gives a brisk relish upon the Palate, and then dies upon it; whilst a studied Discourse, like Liquor drawn out of an old consular Vessel, hath a strong body, and conveys a practical heat to the Conscience: You must know, MADAM, that this Gentleman hath deriv'd all his Eloquence from your Sex, for being kindled with an Amour in his youth, his Imagi∣nation hath not been cool ever since; and now he applies all the strains of a prophane Passion to a divine Object; and the Affection he could not gain in the Ruelle, he endeavours to captivate in the Pulpit: As in a Catholick Country, a dis∣grac'd Lover always turns Capuchine; and the most zealous
Votary in a Convent is he that hath lost his Mistress. Men∣doza the Spaniard, MADAM, hath a very severe Expression; El ambicion de la emprenta es una colpa que non basta arre∣pentirse; That the ambition to be in Print is a fault for which repentance can be no sufficient expiation: Now besides the presumption of the attempt, I am conscious of a great many defects in this Poem; there are flaws in the Conduct of it, and the Characters are not work'd up with that vigor of thought and stile as they ought to be: but as I was never equal to such a performance, so at present I labour under a great decay of Spirits; being but slowly recovering of those Wounds the iniquity of some Mens proceedings have given me: Be∣sides, MADAM, you know, I was always a Dreamer; and one who, for want of better Company, generally converseth with himself: we lose our selves in our own Labyrinths, and weaken the powers of our Mind by too much thinking: I am sensible it is an Humor not to be indulg'd, for with the least incourage∣ment it grows headstrong, and becomes frequent in its Ac∣cesses; and tho' the lucid Intervals, as they call them, when the Clouds are dispers'd, are I believe more sprightly then the softest Moments of any other Men whatever; yet they do not recompence for the Fears and Sadnesses which are incident to this condition at all other times. This, MADAM, I have often lamented to you, and you have been so kind as to mix your Condolances with my Complaints: It hath this peculiarly un∣happy, That as it discolours those Objects to us which strike others with an agreeable light; so it subjects all that we say or do to mistakes; a little neglect in our Behaviour is censur'd to be Pride; and that unwieldiness it loads us with, is call'd an affected Sloth; tho' it is impossible to be assiduous and eager in the pursuit of that we fancy we can take no pleasure in: But it was never so dark with me yet, but I could distinguish my Friends, and take the right measure of their Obligations: Those I have receiv'd from you, MADAM, are lodg'd in a distinct Archive, with the marks of a particular Esteem; for I am with the deepest Respect possible, for your Person and great Endowments,
