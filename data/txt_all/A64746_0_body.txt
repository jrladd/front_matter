MY LORD,
IT is a Position ancient∣ly known, and modern Experience hath allow∣ed it for a sad truth, that Absence and time, (like Cold weather, and an unnaturall dormition) will blast and wear out of memorie the most Endearing obliga∣tions; And hence it was that some

Politicians in Love have lookt upon the former of these two as a main re∣medy against the fondness of that Passion. But for my own part (my Lord) I shall deny this Aphorisme of the people, and beg leave to assure your Lordship, that, though these reputed obstacles have lain long in my way, yet neither of them could work upon me: for I am now (without adulation) as warm and sensible of those numerous favours, and kind Influences receiv'd some∣times from your Lordship, as I re∣ally was at the Instant of fruition. I have no plott by preambling thus, to set any rate upon this present ad∣dresse, as if I should presume to va∣lue a Return of this nature equall with your Lordships Deserts, but

the designe is, to let you see that this habit I have got of being troublesome flowes from two excusable principles, Gratitude, and Love. These inward Counsellours (I know not how dis∣creetly) perswaded me to this At∣tempt and Intrusion upon your name, which if your Lordship will vouchsafe to own as the Genius to these papers, you will perfect my hopes, and place me at my full height. This was the Ayme, my Lord, and is the End of this work, which though but a Pazzarello to the vo∣luminoseè Insani, yet as Iezamin and the Violet find room in the bank as well as Roses and Lillies, so happi∣ly may this, and (if shin'd upon by your Lordship) please as much. To whose Protection, Sacred as your

Name, and those eminent Honours which have alwayes attended up∣on't through so many generations, I humbly offer it, and remain in all numbers of gratitude,
Newton by Usk this 17. of De∣cemb. 1647.My honour'd Lord, Your most affectionate, humblest Servant
