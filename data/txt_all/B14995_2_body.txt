HE that is more, then what he seemes to bee,
Deriues his worth from no such idle fame,
As fashion only giues: that which we see
Of golden vanitie, is not the same
Which it appeares; and therefore I would find
One that hath more then what bare fashion made,
That might without partialitie of minde
Proceed to censure that which heere is said.
Then leauing those, whose worth on vaine stent
Of golden outsides only doth depend;
To you (praise-worthie Sir) this part is meant.
This Furie to your censure I commend:


In reading which, if you no profit gaine,
You shall at least find pleasure for your paine.
