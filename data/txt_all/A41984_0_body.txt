My LORD,
WHile these Elegies of Cornelius
Gallus remain'd in their na∣tive
dress, they were thereby secur'd
from the Censures of all, as well the
Learned, as Ʋnlearned: from these,
because they could not either read or
understand them; and from the others,
because they acquiesc'd in the Reputa∣tion
which the Author had amongst

the greatest of the Roman Wits. But
since they are habited in the English
Tongue, nor, 'tis likely, now so well a∣dapted
to every Mode of Expression in
that Language, as they might have
been by another Hand, I have pre∣sum'd
to shelter them under Your
Lordship's Name for Protection; and
this I am incourag'd to from the sence
I have of the many undeserved Favours
Your Lorship (when applied to) affords
to any Distress; for such is every one,
who in this Age adventures to write,
by opposing himself thereby to the usual
Assaults, at least, of the most rigid and
the severest Criticks. But if this first
Essay of mine in this Nature may at
any time be thought worthy to enter∣tain
some few of Your Lordship's lea∣sure

Hours, and pass Your reading with
any Approbation, I have my utmost end,
and shall be altogether regardless of the
ineffectual Criticisms of others, relying
on Your Lordship's Judgment only, as a
sufficient Defence for me against all the
expected Machinations of the Wits,
who, perhaps, may think it an Invasion
upon the Particular Privilege of their
Society, for any to write, who have not
yet had the Fortune to be admitted a∣mongst
'em.
And now, My Lord, were my Talent
in Panegyrick, equivolent to what Your
Worth requires, I should here take no∣tice
of (with all the advantageous Rhe∣torick
they merit) Your Lordship's ma∣ny
noble Qualifications, and how well
your Mind is proportion'd to the Cha∣racter

you bear in the World, and that
Your Lordship does not only inherit the
Honours, but the Vertues of Your anci∣ent
Family, which are seldomer trans∣mitted
to Posterity from Ancestors then
Estates. But since such a design in me
would rather serve to injure then illu∣strate
Your Lordship's Fame, I believe
it more my Duty to be silent, then offend
by the ill management of so great a
Task. And shall therefore only now
beg Your Lordship's pardon for covet∣ing
to my self the Honour of subscri∣bing
me,
My LORD,
