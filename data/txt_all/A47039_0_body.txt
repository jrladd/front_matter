VVHerein you may find a way how to prevent both Con∣sumption, and Scurvies; which is the killing Distempers of these times, and many of you go out of your Apprentiships full of the Scurvies, or Consumptions, or both: and though you do serve out your times, yet instead of being capable to enjoy your selves, and mind your Imploy∣ments in the World, many, to my know∣ledge, have been weak and sickly, and not fit to do themselves any good; but now you may prevent such dangers according as I have directed you in this Book, without hindrance of business; and so by that means you may be able to do your Ma∣sters service comfortably, and also to do for your selves when you are out of your time.
