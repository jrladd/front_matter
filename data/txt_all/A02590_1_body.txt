REuerend Sir; this Sermon, I know, is at the Presse before you expected: But I thought (as this glorious Chappell occasio∣ned it,) so it might minister occasion of per∣petuall remembrance of the Chappell, by re∣maining its first Monument. And altho both these were confined to the priuate; the Chap∣pell for the Family of my Right Honourable Lord, the Earle of Exceter, who hath giuen the materiall thereof sufficient luster: and the Copie of the Sermon to the Cabinet of my truly Noble, and vertuous Lady, his Countesse; yet both these are much and oft required to the publike; the Sermon to be an instruction, and so it is; the Chappell, to bee

an example, and so it may be. The Sermon to teach all, to be all glorious in their soules. The Chappell to teach some, who build hou∣ses for their owne habitation, to set vp ano∣ther for Gods Religion. The Sermon was craued at the hands of my Honourable La∣dy, that it might come to the Presse; who, of her owne pious disposition, gaue forth the Copie; and for her Noble esteeme of your selfe, and of the worth of your Sermon, was willing and desirous to giue it way to the Printer. And this I thought good to impart vnto you, and to the courteous Reader, that you may be satisfied of the meanes how, and the cause why it comes in publike. And so praying for you, and desiring your prayers for me, I remaine
