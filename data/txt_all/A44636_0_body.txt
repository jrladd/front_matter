My LORD,
IN Obedience to the Order I receiv'd from your Lordship and the Court of Aldermen, I have now Publish'd the Sermon lately preach'd before you, with the Addition of some Things, which, through the Strait∣ness of my Time, were then omitted, and do most humbly present it to your Lordship. I should not have thought it fit for Publick View, after so many Excel∣lent Discourses as have been printed within a few Years, in Defence of the Doctrine of the Trinity; neither would I have ventur'd to preach to such an Auditory, upon so Great and Venerable a Mystery, if the Time, to which I was confin'd by a Particular Providence, had not requir'd it. But as that Pro∣vidence will, I hope, Justifie me in Choosing such a Subject; so the Authority of your Lordship and your
Honourable Brethren will Vindicate me in Publishing my Discourse upon it.
I pray God convince those Ʋnhappy Men in our Days, who have deserted the Faith they were baptized into, and deny the Lord that bought them, (for I am sure a meer Man could never do it,) that they may escape the Destruction he hath threaten'd to them. And that the same God would continually bless your Lord∣ship, and give Success to your Pious Endeavours to suppress Error and Wickedness, in an Age and Place that need all your Authority and Zeal to that End, is also the hearty Prayer of,
My LORD,
