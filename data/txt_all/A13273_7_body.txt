I Owe You Each a larger Summ:
Why bring I then to Both a Crumm?
To shew you Both, My Shifts, to liue;
Euen faine to Borrow what I giue:
But better so, then (blushless) steal
Others Conceipts; or Debts conceale.
Til more my Might, diuide this Myte.
A Larke (they say) is worth a Kite:
Some Greater, greater things present,
Of lesser Worth, or worser meant.
GOD measures not our Work, but Will:
Doe You the like: and loue me still.
