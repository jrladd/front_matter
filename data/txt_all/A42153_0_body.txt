SIR,
AS SOON as my little Affairs would give me leave (and you know this hath been a season of more than Ordinary business with men of my employments) I have sent you a Transcript of what was lately deliver∣ed at the enterment of your Dear Father, together with some few Additions which then by reason of the straitness of the time, were thought fit to be omitted; and the whole (such as it is) is freely tendered to your disposal. All that I aim at in sending You so mean a Present is, to give some further Testimony and Assurance both of my respect to the Memory of my Deceased Friend, and of the Continuance thereof to Your self, the only surviving Issue of his Body. And if the Review of what You then heard can add any thing to Your Satisfaction or Advantage upon any account, I shall be very glad of it, and of any occasion that shall be offered, whereby I may be able, according to my Capacity and the real inclinations of my Soul, more amply to ex∣press how much I am,
SIR,

August 14. 1680.
