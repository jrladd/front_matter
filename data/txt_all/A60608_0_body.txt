My LORD,
ALtho' I do humbly
Acknowledge, That
it is too Great a Hap∣piness
for me, to have both
the Honour and Advantage of
sheltering my Self in this
Adventure under Your Lord∣ship's
Protection, yet I hope I
may presume upon another



Favour from Your Lord∣ship,
by this Address: And
that is, That Your Lordship
would please to Interpret
and Accept it, as an In∣stance
of my Grateful Ac∣knowledgment
of many Sig∣nal
Kindnesses formerly re∣ceived
from some of Your
Lordship's Noble Ancestors.
And tho', My Lord, there
may be an Exception made,
That I should Dedicate a
Book that relates to a Fu∣ture
World, to a Person of
Honour, in the Youthful
Flourish of his Age, and in
the very Point of his Ascen∣dency
to Temporal Greatness;

yet I am so far Assur'd of
Your Lordship's Ingenuity
and Goodness, that You will
neither refuse to be adver∣tis'd,
nor be aggriev'd to
think, That when You have
pass'd over the several Sta∣ges
of Your Mortality, You
must become an Inhabitant
in the Future World, whose
Real Existence I have endea∣vour'd
to ascertain to the
Reason of a Man, as the
Truth of it is more espe∣cially
secur'd, by the Faith
of a Christian.
And, My Lord, I doubt
not, but that this Discourse
will be the rather accept∣able



to Your Lordship, now
You are so Honourably en∣gaged
in His Majesty's Ser∣vice,
as that it may possibly
add to the Numbers of His
Majesty's Dutiful Subjects:
And that, because there are
no sorts of Men more ready
to Degenerate into Republi∣can
Principles and Practices,
than those, who when they
are told of their Duties to
their Prince, upon Religi∣ous
Obligations, can Mock
at the Concerns of another
World.
And now, My Lord, as to
Your Own Person; If Your
Lordship shall, upon Your

Perusal of this Treatise, meet
with any thing which may
Contribute to Your Lordship's
Happy Interest in that Fol∣lowing
World; as such a Suc∣cess
will amply Recompense
me for the Pains I have ta∣ken
upon that Famous Sub∣ject,
so it will answer the
affectionate Desires and Pray∣ers
of,
My Lord,

March 28th.
1688.
