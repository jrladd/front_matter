Honour'd Sir,
THe first Prospect of your Person, methoughts, presented me with such a Landskip of Candor and Ingenuity, of such sweetness of Disposition and native Goodness, as that I pre∣sently began not only to admire the Sce of your Accomplishments, but passionately to be ravisht with the Love of them. The secret charms of I know not what Excellency (Ethicks her self can't give it a name) that runs through and adorns the whole frame and course of your Life and Being, did so captivate and affect me, as that I wisht I might be so happy as to enjoy the Mercy of your Worthy Acquaintance; and to live under the influence of so much Vertue, I wish't I might be blest with an opportunity of expressing the Religion of that Homage and Ser∣vice,
which I owe to you; and of presenting you with somewhat as a Pledge and Emblem of the profoundest Esteem, and most devout Affection I bear towards you: And indeed Providence hath been so propitious as to an∣swer my desires, in occasionally fixing me some∣times near you, and in placing me within the Verge of that Paradise, which your Pre∣sence Consecrates where ever it is; so that I have often been ennobled, nay almost deified in the Elisium of your Company, have become lear∣ned by your Converse, have grown Prudent by your Example, have been maintained at your Table, have been feasted with Civilities both from your Person and Fortune, and have en∣joyed the Favours of all your circumstances and capacities; For which I return you an Eterni∣ty of Thanks. Neither am I unsuccesseful in my second Prayers, Fortune having put into mine hands an opportunity, whereby I am capacitated to put somewhat into yours; I mean this inconsiderable trifle, which I do not Dedicate as a Present to requite you, but ra∣ther as a Toy to play withall, and to divert you. I hope you will pardon the Solecism, and Impropriety of the Gift, for I must confess I am sensible of mine Errour in Prefacing with so stately a Frontispeice so mean an Edifice; I mean in prefixing your name to so poor a
Pamphlet, your more curious Ingenuity, large Capacity, and universal Accomplishments in more solid Learning, I know deserve a treat∣ment of the Quintensence and Elixirs of choicer Muses: I am not ignorant, that knotty Maxims of Policy, subtleties of Government, and In∣trigues of State; a mistery in Divinity, and sublimer Speculations are more suitable Enter∣tainments to the Acuteness of your Parts, the Swiftness of your Apprehension and Penetra∣tion of your Judgment; But when I consi∣der that you have advanc't so far in all Are and Science, as that the utmost of my Studies can't contribute one thought to further your Progress. I say, seeing I cannot inform you, hubmly crave leave with these Toys to recreate you. They were the Spawn and Issue of some spare hours, and are fit only for the Entertain∣ment of idle time; 'tis not handsome nor mo∣dish for me to commend them; only thus much I think I may safely say, if you are inclin'd to sleep, their lulling Quality will be Poppy to your temples, and may procure a nod as soon perhaps, as the greatest Narcotick, which if it does effect, it will do you a kindness, in removing you from the noise of a tumultuous world, and in relieving you with the ease and softness of a silent slumber. I now withdraw from your presence to prevent the creation of a
further trouble. All that I desire, is a Candid acceptance of what is here tender'd; which if you shall graciously receive as a meer testi∣mony of my gratefull respects for all Favours, without any further design on your Worth and Goodness, I am at the height of mine Am∣bition, and have obtained the end of my pre∣sent Addresses. I am
Honour'd Sir 
Helmdon.
