PErusing (Right re∣uerend Father) the worthie soundnes of godly doctrine and instruction, conteined in this short, fruitfull, and learned Compen∣dium, drawne out of Caluins Insti∣tutions: I supposed with my selfe that my labour should not only be not euill bestowed, but also fruit∣fully imploied in the englishing of the same, aswell for that the doing thereof might be a meanes, at those voide times which I found out, to translate this worke, to expel idle∣nesse,
 wherein homines male agere di∣scunt, Men practise to doe euill, and also to exercise and encrease with the good seruants, the small talent of knowledge that God in mercy hath geuen me; as also the same be∣ing doone, that those godly dispo∣sed brethren that are not of abilitie to buie the whole Institutions, ha∣uing this (wherevnto I haue added the expositiō of those places which the enimies of all trueth haue fals∣ly corrupted, to mainteine their er∣rours (not of my self, but verbatim as it lieth in Caluin) may enioy & obteine some profite thereof. And although we haue much to praise God our heauenly Father for his great blessings bestowed vpō vs, by the worthy trauel of godly learned men, in setting foorth and transla∣ting diuerse and learned bookes in∣to our vulgar tongue, to the encrea∣sing
 of the knowledge of almigh∣tie God in them, that haue not the knowledge of tongues, to theyr great profite, and singular comfort of al godly men, which rather wish their knowledge in Gods worde, to their saluation, than their conti∣nuall ignoraunce to their eternall damnation: yet I think that this E∣pitomie aswel for the breuitie ther∣of, as the pithines of the same, will doe good vnto as many as thirst af∣ter the true knowledge of Gods sa∣cred word. And albeit, all places of scripture are not there expounded, yet such places are there opened, as may satisfie any Christian man to cōfirme his faith by, & such light in thē shewed, as may easily shew the way to the true meaning of many other places, not there contained. Wherfore right Honourable and Reuerende Father in Christe, my
 humble sute is, that after this booke be examined & wel liked, you wold accept this rude translation, as the naked growthes of a barreine soile, and first fruits of such an enterprise, and passe it vnder the warrant of your Honours good protection, whose only name may priuiledge my cause. Thus surceasing to mo∣lest your Honor with my grosse & tedious stile, I pray God to direct and lead you in your godly course while life lasteth, to Gods honour and glorie, who euer preserue you to your latter end, and send you fe∣licitie in Christe, for euer to en∣dure.
From London
the 9. of August. 1579.
