MOst noble Captain, under whose Comâˆ£mand,
I have been Servant both by Sea and Land,
Peruse these Lines, which though they do not show
Wonders unto you, yet they'r true, you know,
Your self enduring many a bitter Blast,
From the first of the Voyage, to the last.
Read and accept them, so desires your Friend
Who is, and will be, till his Life doth end.
