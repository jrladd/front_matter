MY LORD,
SInce Prudence, Truth, and Loyalty relate
To the Just Function of a Magistrate,
Joyn'd with Succession, and Election too,
The City's pleas'd, finding all these in You:
'Tis these, may't please Your Lordship, in a word,
That have advanc'd You to the City-Sword,
And Seat of Magistrates; where, next to th' KING,
You have a complete Power of Governing:
And may You prosper in it this whole Year,
And to the general Citizens appear,
Rather the Object of their Love than Fear
(The best Obedience.) Terror may controll
The Body, but 'tis Love that rules the Soul:
And may that Love so efficacious be,
You may allure Men to Civility.
Such are the Wishes and the Prayers of Your
True Servant, and most humble Orator,
MY LORD,
