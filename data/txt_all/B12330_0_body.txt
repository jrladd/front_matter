SEN the beginning of the Reformatione of the Kirk of Scotland, in the trew Christiane Reli∣gione, amangis all vther thingis that ʒour L. Tauellitan, for the furthsetting of the Religion of Christe, I hard nocht ʒour Lmair effectiusly desyre ony thing, than that I wald make ane Answer to the lytle Burk, set furth be Maister Quintine Kennedy Commendatare, Abbote of Crosraguell: (inseriuit ane Compendius ractiue conferme to the Scrip∣turs of Alychty God, reasone and authoritie, declaring the narrest and onely way, to establische the conscience of ane Chri∣stiane man, in all maters quhilks ar in debait, concerning Faith and Religione) Quhareby thare hes bene mony mouit to continew still in thare auld superstitione and Idolatrie, throw the reasonis contenit in the same, quha had imbracit the sincere, and trew Religione of Christe, or thir davis, and it had bene supprest in it infancie, quhilk wald haue brocht baith qui∣etnes to mony ane in thare conscience, and commone peace, with great amitie amangis the inhabitantes of this countrie. And quhowbeit my inhabilitie dissuadit me fra taking of sic ane interpryse on hand, ʒit ʒour L. earnestfull and godly desyre, was of sa great weicht, and efficacie in my mynde, for the great Actes ʒour L. tuik on hand, first and last, for the mante∣nance of thaim that was able to haue bene opprest for the Re∣ligione of Christe, but feare of ony warldly Creature, or losing of ʒour warldly gudis. And alswa for the great humanitie, that I haue found in ʒour L. at all tyme, monit me (quhen I saw na vther, haistely taking the confutatione heirof on hand) to schaw my labours heirin, that the people of God sould not be langer abusit with his captions Sophisticatione, safar as be
 my simple ingyne, thay mycht be supportit, to the auancemnt of the Kingdome of God: and that the warld mycht manifestly knaw that it was noht of Rashnes, that the nobilitie of this Realme hasart thare liues and lan is, for the Reformatione of Religione (as the Papistes alledgit) bot for the suppressing of thay things, quhilk was set vp aganis the glorie of the eternal God, and commone weill of this Realme.
And because this Buik of M. Q. contenit sa mony absurdi∣teis, quhilk wald haue consumit great tyme, to haue confutit thaim all. It chancit weill, that ane lytle space before the be∣ginning of the Reformation of the Religion, he excerptit furth of this hale Buik, ane Schort tractiue, contening the hale mater of his Buik, as the Coppy bearis that he send me, to pre∣sent to Iames Betoune, Archebischop of Glasgw (quha was my gude Maister and liberall Freind, quhowbeit for religione we ar now seperatit in ane part, as mony Fathers and sonnes is, in thir our dayis) to quhom I pray God, send the trenth and knawledge of his worde: at, that may vnit vs in Spirit and mynde againe together, that hes seperatit vs (as apperis) in our warldly kyndenes. And sen of lait, that I fand this Tractiue, contening the hale substance of his Buik, amangis vther quaris of vther learuit mennis writingis that I haue. Aganis it I haue ttauellit be Scripturs, Reasonis, and An∣cient Doctours sayingis, swa that heirby, I traist in God, the mouthes of the wickit, for the maist part salbe closit, that brag∣gis with thare Councels, and Papisticall Decretis, and consti¦tutionis, outdrawing the hartis of the simple people fra the trew Religione, and thay quha hes bene in dout, quhidder thay war obleist to obserue and keip the decretis of thare councels or not: In thare conscience salbe quiettit, assuritly knawing be the worde of God, quhat sould be keipit, and quhat nocht.
Praying ʒour L. to tak this my labours, quhilk I haue dedi∣cate to ʒour L. in gude part. And that as ʒour L. hes begune to mantene the trew Faith, and sincere Religione, teachit vs be Christe: Swa I pray the leuing Lorde God, to mantene ʒour L. and all fauourers of the same, vnto the end, that we may altogether receaue the Croune of immortall lyfe, that is promisit to the faithfull, quha perseueris vnto the end.
