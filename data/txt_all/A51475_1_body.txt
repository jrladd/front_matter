SIR,
FRance, which being well uni∣ted,
as we now behold it,
under the Glorious Reign of your
Majesty, might give law to all the
World; was upon the point of self
Destruction, by the division which
was rais'd in it by two fatal
Leagues of Rebels: the one in
the middle, and the other to∣wards

the latter end of the last
Age.
Heresie produc'd the first, a∣gainst
the true Religion: Ambi∣tion
under the Masque of Zeal
gave birth to the second, with
pretence of maintaining what
the other wou'd have ruin'd: and
both of them, though implacable
Enemies to each other, yet agreed
in this, that each of them at di∣vers
times, set up the Standard
of Rebellion against our Kings.
The crimes of the former I have
set forth in the History of Cal∣vinism,
which made that impious
League in France, against the
Lord and his Anointed; and I
discover the Wickedness of the lat∣ter
in this Work, which I present
to your Majesty, as the fruit of
my exact Obedience to those com∣mands
with which you have been

pleas'd to honour me. I have endea∣vour'd
to perform them, with so
much the greater satisfaction to
my self, because I believ'd that in
reading this History, the falsehood
of some advantages which the
Leaguers and Huguenots have
ascrib'd to themselves, may be ea∣sily
discern'd. These by boasting
as they frequently do, even at this
day, that they set the Crown on
the Head of King Henry the
Fourth; those that their League
was the cause of his conversion.
I hope the world will soon be dis∣abus'd
of those mistakes; and
that it will be clearly seen, that
they were the Catholiques of the
Royal Party, who next under
God, produc'd those two effects,
so advantageous to France. We
are owing for neither of them
to those two unhappy Leagues,

which were the most dangerous
Enemies to the prosperity of the
Kingdom: And 'tis manifest at
this present time, that the glo∣ry
of triumphing over both of
them, was reserv'd by the Di∣vine
Providence, to our Kings
of the Imperial Stem of Bour∣bon.
Henry the Fourth subdued and
reduc'd the League of the false
Zealots, by the invincible Force
of his Arms, and by the wonder∣full
attractions of his Clemency;
Lewis the Iust disarm'd that
of the Calvinists by the taking
of Rochelle, and other places,
which those Heretiques had moul∣ded
into a kind of Common∣wealth,
against their Sove∣raign.
And Lewis the Great,
without employing other Arms
than those of his Ardent Cha∣rity,

and incomparable Zeal
for the Conversion of Prote∣stants,
accompanied by the Iu∣stice
of his Laws, has reduc'd
it to that low condition, that
we have reason to believe, we
shall behold its ruine, by the
repentance of those, who being
deluded and held back by their
Ministers, continue still in their
erroneous belief, rather through
ignorance than malice. And
this is it, which when accom∣plish'd
will surpass even all those
other wonders which daily are be∣held,
under your most auspicious
Government.
Vndoubtedly, Sir, your Maje∣sty
has perform'd by your Victori∣ous
Arms, your generous good∣ness,
and your more than Royal
magnificence, all those great and
Heroique actions, which will ever

be the admiration of the World,
and infinitely above the commen∣dations
which future Ages, in imi∣tation
of the present, will conse∣crate
to your immortal memo∣ry.
I presume not to undertake
that subject, because it has al∣ready
drain'd the praises of the
noblest Pens, which yet have
not been able to raise us to that
Idea  you, which we ought
justly to conceive: I shall onely
say, that what you have done with
so much Prudence, Iustice, and
Glory, by extending the French
Monarchy to its ancient bounds,
and rendring it, as it is at pre∣sent,
as flourishing, and as much
respected by all the World, as
it ever has been, under the
greatest and most renown'd of all
our Monarchs, is not so great in
the sight of God, as what your

Majesty performs daily, with so
much Piety, Zeal, and good
success, in augmenting the King∣dom
of Jesus Christ, and procu∣ring
the Conversion of our Pro∣testants,
by those gentle and ef∣ficacious
means which you have
us'd.
This, Sir, is without excep∣tion,
the most glorious of all
your Conquests, and while you
continue to enjoy on earth that
undisputed glory, which your o∣ther
actions have acquir'd you,
is preparing an eternal triumph
for you in the Heavens.
'Tis what is continually im∣plor'd
of God, in his most ar∣dent
Prayers, who enjoying the
abundant favours of your Ma∣jesty,
lives at this day the
most happy of Mankind, under
your most powerfull Protection,

and is most oblig'd to continue
all his life, with all imaginable
Respect and Zeal,
Sir,
