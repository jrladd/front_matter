Most Mighty and Eternal God,
thou King of Kings, and
Prince of Peace,
IT was from thee that I at first Derived
the Original of my Being; and it is
upon the sole account of thy free Grace,
and unmerited Goodness, that I injoy
my Well Being too, with all that I am and
have, which both Obliges aud Encourages me
to approach thy Foot-stool, and with all possi∣ble

Veneration, prostrating my self before the
Throne of thy Glory, Humbly Offer up, and
Dedicate to thy Sacred Majesty the insuing
Meditations, Solemnly begging for the sake
of thy Eternal Son, the Lord Jesus; that thou
wouldest cast a Favourable Eye upon them,
and do thy Servant who acknowledges himself
to be the meanest and unworthiest of all thy
Subjects, the Honour to accept and own them,
by makeing them useful to Convey the Know∣ledge
of thy self to Vnconverted Sinners?
Convince them of their lost and undone Con∣dition
by Nature, and the danger they are in
of being miserable for ever. Allure them to
fall in Love with, and Imbrace thy Son, who is
so Beautiful and Lovely, that he infinitely ex∣ceeds
all Comparison; and so Loving, Tender,
and Compassionate, that he hath no Parallel.
Let it point out to them the way to Christ,
who is the way to thee, and the only means
whereby they can be Reconciled to thee, and be
made happy in the injoyment of thee: Let
them tend to the promoting the Spiritual
Good and Eternal happiness of all those in∣to
whose hands they shall come.
It is probable, and I expect no less, that
they will fall into the Hands of some whose
Curiosity will be the only Motive that Prompts
them to Read, and Design the Perusal of them

shall only serve to please and gratify their fan∣cy
with the Quaintness and Vnusualness of the
Method wherein they are Penned, or to verify
the truth of the Proverb, The Eye is not
satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear with
hearing; but if thou wilt please by the Pow∣erful
influence of thy Grace, to make them
fall in Love with and Entertain the Substance,
whilest they only designed to sport and play
with the shadow, I shall thereby obtain my End
in Composing and Publishing them.
And I humbly Implore, that as when I was
indeavouring with incredible Pains and In∣dustry
to precipitate my self into a Gulf of
deplorable Misery, the Nature and Extent
whereof thy self hath described to be Wrath
to come, Thou wast pleased out of thy In∣finite
Goodness, and Tender Compassions, which
have been ever of Old, to pluck me out of the
Horrible Pit, as a Brand out of the Fire,
and by an Effectual changing of my Nature,
turn my Feet into the ways of thy Testimo∣nies,
and perswade me to go on Pilgrimage to
the Celestial Canaan, and hast enabled me
to make a Considerable Progress towards it
through the midst of many amazing difficul∣ties,
and to trample under Feet, and with ease
and facility pass over innumerable Discourage∣ments,
not only from those who were travelling

the contrary way, and with an Infernal
Eagerness directing their hasty Steps towards
the Sulphury Lake, from whom I expected no
fairer dealing, but even from my fellow Pil∣grims
too, so thou wouldest please by the Pow∣er
of thy Grace to inable me to persevere there∣in,
until thou hast safely carried me through
all the remaining Difficulties and Dangers of
my Journey, brought me within the Gates of
Zion, and given me an Actual Possession of a
perfect and everlasting happiness in the im∣mediate
enjoyment of thy self, and the Bea∣tifical
Visions of thy Face.
And if in the mean while, I may by this
or any other means be an instrument of doing
good to my fellow Pilgrims, Increasing and
Advancing the Kingdom of Christ in the
World, and bringing Glory and Honour to
thy Name, then the End and Design will
be sufficiently obtained, which really is the
aim of him, who is not, would not, will not
be his own; but as innumerable Instances of
Divine Goodness hath infinitely Obliged me
to be seriously, so I solemnly promise and re∣solve
to be for ever thine, in Time, and to
Eternity.
