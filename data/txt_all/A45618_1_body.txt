THE way of Dialog being not faithfully manag'd, is of all others the most fraudulent; but being faithfully manag'd, is the clearest and most effectual for conveying a mans sense into the underâˆ£standing of his Reader. There is nothing in this World, next the favor of God, I so much desire as to be familiarly understood; which because great men have thought below them, has prov'd hitherto but the ruin of themselves, and the detriment of the Public: for which reason, having try'd all other means, I now add this. My work, if I be not given over to utter blindness, is the same with, or nearest, that of the Nation; and the Work of the Nation being not understood, is in extreme danger of utter ruin.
