SIR,
ONE of the greatest impedi∣ments that hinders the re∣union of Protestants with the Roman Church, from which by a fatal Schism they are separated, is that false Opinion wherewith they are pre∣judiced, that we raise the Popes even above the Universal Church, in attri∣buting to them what only belongs to her, and in giving them an absolute and unlimited Power not only in Spi∣rituals, but also over the Temporal and Crowns of Princes.
The Gallican Church, willing to help on that great zeal which Your Majesty makes so conspicuously suc∣cessful
for the Conversion of your Sub∣jects who continue still in Error, hath thought that she could not do any thing to better purpose, than to re∣move that obstacle, by undeceiving them, and professing, as she hath done by a solemn Declaration upon a Point of that importance, her Doctrin which is in all things conform to that of the Ancient Church.
It is the business of this Treatise, which is purely Historical, to make this out by matters of fact, against which no subtlety, argumentation, nor Artifice of Novelty can hold good. Nay, Sir, I dare even present it to Your Majesty as a Work that, perhaps, may be so happy as to contribute some∣what in making the Justice of your Edict known to the World, whereby, in quality of Protector of the Canons, you make the Ancient belief current
in the most Christian Kingdom.
This it is, Sir, that makes it truly to be said, that Your Majesty hath done more for the Church of Rome than the Kings your Predecessors, who have enriched her with the great Re∣venues she possesses, and who have raised her to the pinacle of Temporal Grandeur and Dignities. For, indeed, all that Wealth and these Worldly Grandeurs belong not to her true Kingdom, which being that of Jesus Christ, ought not to be of this World. But in commanding by your Laws, that this Doctrin of Antiquity be maintained in France, to which the Gallican Church, which hath always vigourously defended the interests and just Prerogatives of the Church of Rome, hath in all Ages inviolably adhered: You most solidly establish the Primacy of the Pope against the
Novel attempts of Hereticks who dispute it, and do all that they can to snatch it from him. At the same time you take from them the pretext of their Revolt, by letting them see, that we believe not that which scandalises them, and which some late Divines at∣tribute to him, of their own Head, against the manifest Judgment of An∣tiquity.
That, Sir, is what may be called an effectual endeavour for restoring the true Kingdom of the Church of Rome to its Just Rights, from which Hereticks, who have separated from it through erroneous Notions that have been given them of our Doctrin, have in little more than an Age rent away a great part of Europe. Your Majesty who hath wrought and still work so ma∣ny Miracles, to render your King∣dom more Powerful and more
flourishing than ever, and to grant us once more a general Peace, by making our Enemies accept it, upon the con∣ditions you thought fit to prescribe to them, is apparently appointed of God to work the greatest of all, in paci∣fying the troubles of Religion, and in rendering to the Kingdom of the Church in France, its ancient extent, by the reduction of the remnant of our Protestants.
For my own part, who have but very little longer to live, and, who, according to my Profession, can con∣tribute nothing to your Conquests, but by my ardent Prayers: I shall reckon my self most happy, and shall die content, if I can but joyn a little by my Pen, to those which you daily Atchieve for enlarging the Empire of the Church, by the Con∣version of Hereticks, which by most
soft and efficacious ways you procure; And if by my Writings and particu∣larly by this, I can make it known to all the World, as I hope I may, that I am as true a Catholick as a good French Man, and that I will die, as I have lived,
SIR,
