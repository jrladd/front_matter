Most worthy Sir, as Quintillian in his Apothegmes to the naked, learned, Gimnose∣phists
of AEthiopia, very wittily sayes, Potanto Machayo corbatio monomosco
kayturemon Lescus, Ollipufftingere whingo: which is, knowledge is a maine
Antithesis to ignorance, and paines and trauaile is the high way to experience. I
beeing therefore well acquainted with the generous vrbanity innated or rooted in
your humanity, (in these dayes of vanity,) I dedicate out (of my affability, debility,
ability, imbecility, facility, or agility,) this poore Pamphlet to your nobility, in
all seruility and humility: not doubting but the fluent secundity of your wisedomes, profundity, in
your heads retundity, will conserue, reserue, preserue, and obserue, what I and my industrious labours
deserue. I doe (out of mine owne congnition) auerre and abett, that he is senselesse that will assent, that
the Fates did assigne, with their whole assistance, that any should aspire to bee an associate in any as∣sembly,
boldly to assimulate, assay, assault, or ascribe to any mortall but your selfe, super latiue maro∣rity
or transcendency for trauailes, obseruations, and or atorie. These things being reuolued and rumi∣nated,
in the sagacitie or acutenesse of my Pericranion, I imagined that no man vnder the Cope was
more worthy then your selfe to be a Patronizing Poplar to shelter my poore reed-like endeauours. How∣soeuer in the preter lapsed occurrences there hath beene an Antagonisticall repugnancy betwixt vs, yet
I hope time and trauaile hath worne it thred bare, or brought it to an irrecouerable consumption; with∣all I know you are vncapable of inexpugnable malice, inueterate malignancy: or emulation. I protest
tongue-tide taciturnity should haue imprisoned this worke in the Lethargicall Dungeon, or bottomlesse
Abisse of euer-sleeping obliuion, but that I am confident of your Patronage and acceptance, which if it
fall out (no according to any Promerits of mine) but out of mine owne expectation of your matchlesse &
vnparalcll dd sposition, I shall hereafter sacrifice whole Hecatombs of inuention both in Prose & Verse,
at the shrine of your vnfellowed and vnfollowed vertues. So wishing more to see you then to heare from
you, because Writers want worke, and the Presse is turned, voluntary through the scarcity of imploy∣ments,
which I hope your presence will supply, I pray that Neptnne, AEolus, Tellus, Bacchus, and all
the watery, windy, earthly, and drinking Deities may be officious, auspicious, and delicious vnto you,
humbly imploring you to take in good part this my sophisticall, paradoxicall, submission, with a mentall
reseruation of my loue and seruice, to sympathize or be equiualent to your kinde liking and corrobora∣ted
affecting.
