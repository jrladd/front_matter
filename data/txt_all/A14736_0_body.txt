Sir,
your Sermon which I copied partly
from your mouth, and partly from your
notes, I haue aduentured into the light;
encouraged by the approbation, and earnest
intreaty of such, whose iudgements you
reuerence, and whose loue you embrace:
who also haue made bold heere and there
to varie somethings, not of anie great conâˆ£sequence,
if I can iudge. I was loth to
smoother such fire in my breast; but to vent
it, to enflame others. If you shall blame me,
I knowe others will thanke mee. What I
haue done is out of zeale, to God, and his
Church.
