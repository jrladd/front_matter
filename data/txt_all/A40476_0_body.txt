HONOURABLE SIR,
TO still the rageing of the sea, and the mad∣ness
of the People, is observ'd by the
Royal Prophet to be the Work of God,
and the Effect of an Almighty Power;
which never appear'd more visibly than
in favour of his Majestie for these several years past.
First by a miraculous revolution of Affaires to make
way for his Accession to the Crown, some time be∣fore
the death of the late King of blessed memory:
then by his peaceable and quiet entrance upon his
Government: and lastly by the sudden dissipation of
the late Rebellion contrary to all humane Appea∣rance
and Expectation.
Never was any people, since the time of Pontius
Pilate, arrived to that height of unaccountable
Madness against a Prince who had often ventur'd his
life for their defence and preservation, and had ne∣ver

given them any provocation, that like the Jewes
against our Saviour, nothing would serve their turnes
but Crucifie him, Crucifie him: and when they were asked
why, what evill hath he don? They cryed out the more,
Let him be Crucified.
A Bill is drawn up, passes the House of Commons,
and all sorts of endeavours us'd to extort the Royal
assent & to get it passed into a Law, for the Exclu∣sion
of the right Heir, for casting him out of his In∣heritance,
and for putting him to death too as a Trai∣tour
and Common Enemie if he offer'd to return from
his Banishment, and did not patiently submit to the
Iniquity of their sentence.
And this Fit of Madness after id had bin a little
quieted by a Dissolution and Change of air, is reviv'd
again by the VOX POPULI or a Cry of importunate
and unmannerly Petitioners from almost all parts of
the Nation for another Excludeing House of Com∣mons,
which is succeeded by another, who are Re∣solved
not to be satisfied with the most Gracious Offers
that were ever made by any Prince to any People, but
only at the expence of the Justice, Honour and Con∣science
of their Soveraigne; till they had renderd them∣selves
useless and dangerous; and the Leading Men a∣mong
them against the Duke of York are found guilty
by a Cloud of Witnesses and their own Confession of

a Conspiracy against the King, whereof part are
brought to condign Punishment, and the rest forced
to save themselves by flight from the hands of Justice:
that it was now high time for the Government to con∣sider
of some more effectual Remedy than had for∣merly
bin us'd to cure the People of their Frenzie,
and to keep them, whether they will or no,
from undoing themselves, in makeing choice of
such Patriots, as under the pretence of secureing
their Religion and Propertie by excludeing the Duke
of York from his Right of succession, would have
infaillibly destroyed both. In order whereunto
an enquiry is made whether such Corporations as
had shewed themselves most factious and disaf∣fected
to the Government, had not abused the
Royal Bounty, by which they held their Charters,
& are found to have incurr'd a forfieture, & so part∣ly
by due Course of Law, & partlie by voluntarie
resignations such Elections are regulated, and care
taken, that only persons of known Loyaltie, & well
affected to the Government both in Church and State
as by Law established should be capable to serve
in Parliament. In the mean time the Fever begins
to abate, and the People to recover their right
senses again. The Duke is sent for Scotland, and by
the way suffers Shipwrack, and by a wonderfull

Providence escapes; and now instead of Crucifie him,
Away vvith him, there is nothing but Hosannas, &
joyfull Acclamations from all Parts and Quarters
of the Kingdom for his happy Escape and Delive∣rance;
together with Protestations, & offers of Li∣ves
& Fortunes to live and die in defence of the King
and his Lawfull Successours.
Thus did God by a series of Miracles both preser∣ve
our present Soveraign, & prepare his way to the
Throne, by turning the hearts & stilling the mad∣nesse
of the people, that there was not a sword
drawn, nor the least Opposition made to hinder, or
so much as question his Rightfull Succession to the
Government upon the Decease of his dear & most
entirely beloved Brother. Which whoever duly con∣siders,
will be forced to confesse, that it was the hand of
the Lord only that could bring such mighty things to passe.
That be stone which the Builders refused should become the
headstone in the Corner! this was certainly the Lords
doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.
The late Rebellion may be said to be some remain∣der
or dregs of the former fit of Madnesse, which (by
the Blessing of God upon his Majesties Armes) is so
totally extinguishd, that so long as it shall please
God to continue his happy Raign over us, we have no
reason to fear any disturbance for the future. For

which unspeakable mercy every true English man
that loves his King, or has any kindnesse for his na∣tive
Country ought to have kept a day of solemne
Thanksgiveing, if there had bin none appointed by
Authority: which has bin the Occasion of preaching
the following Sermon; and which I have made pu∣blick
for the sake of such of my Countrymen in these
Provinces especially as lie under the Imputation
and guilt of assisting the late Rebels, and of con∣tributeing
to the carrying on of so impious and dia∣bolical
a designe: Of whom I do not altogether
despair but that by their own and other mens Mis∣fortunes
they may be perswaded at length to see and
to acknowledg their Errour, and not any longer suf∣fer
themselves to be deceived to their eternal as well
as temporal Ruine and Destruction.
Haveing resolv'd to appear a second time in de∣fence
of the Royal Cause, I have presumed, Honou∣rable
Sir, to put my self under your Honours Patro∣nage
and Protection, and so guarded I shall not be
afraid to bid defiance to all Traitours and Parricides
whatsoever, who are confounded with terrour, when
they hear your very name; nor shall I need to value
any mans Censure, which I never thought so con∣siderable
as to come in competition with the service
of my King or the interest of my Country: which

(next to the Glory of God) being the sole ends both
of preaching and publishing this discourse, I hope
may make some Compensation for the defects that
may be in it, and in some measure excuse this Ad∣dresse
to a Person, whose studie as well as Character
is to encourage any thing of Loyalty, and of whose
indefatigable paines and diligence in endevouring
by the most prudent and effectual means to stifle the
late Rebellion in its birth, and to hinder it from
ever breaking forth, there are sufficient Witnesses;
whose eminent services upon this, as upon many
other Occasions, and rare Accomplishments both
natural and acquired, have justly raisd you to that
place you enjoy in the Esteem and Favour of the
most admired and accomplished Prince in the
World. Which that you may continually more im∣prove,
and find the Effects of it in your Encrease
of Honour, and of all manner of Felicity, there
is no man desires or wishes more than.
Honourable SIR,
