BEloved for Jesus sake; I Dedicate this Sermon to you, not to revive your Grief, but to renew your Comfort; Not to make your Wounds (which he Almigh∣ty hath given you) to bleed afresh; but to lead you to him, who is your Portion, Light and Life. It was your Re∣quest brought me into the Pulpit, and the Consideration of the afflicting Hand of God (which hath in a few Months made many a Breach upon you; first, in taking to himself your dear Husband, and your only Son, and now your Ver∣tuous and Obedient Daughter) engag'd my Thoughts on the following Subject. And now your Request, with many others of my Christian Friends (both known and unknown) hath led me to the Press. It was the Comfort that you and others had from God, in hearing this Discourse, that pre∣vailed with me for its Publication, not any Opinion or Con∣ceit of it in my self. I know not whether it be my Ʋn∣happiness,


that I cannot please my self, in any thing I do for Jesus Christ, yet am not without hopes, that God accepts of my sincere, tho' mean Endeavours, for his Glory, and the good of Souls, my whole design (as far as I know my own heart) is to promote Charity, Truth and Peace, amongst all, with whom I am Concern'd. As knowing, the Glory and Power of the Christian Religion is wrapt up in those things: and that Strife, uncharitable Contentions, Pride and Self-seeking, are Diametrically opposite thereto, I have en∣deavoured, with as little Variation as might be, to send the same to the Press, that was delivered in your hearing; only here and there you have some small Enlargements, which time would not allow me to make, when this Discourse was spoken; Mr. Kitterel's Notes have been some help to me, especially in the Enlargements. My earnest desire is, That as God gave you Comfort, in a time of need, in hear∣ing the Truths herein contained, so you and others may have much more in reading the same, and that God might gracious∣ly sanctify all your Afflictions, and make up your repeated Losses in the aboundant Enjoyment of himself; which is the humble Prayer of,
