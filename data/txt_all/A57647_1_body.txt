SIR,
I Should wrong both you, and my self, if with Harpocrates, the God of Silence, I should lay my finger on my lip, and tacitly passe over either your Worth and Goodnesse, or my obligations and thankfulnesse: Perhaps I may trespasse on your modesty, which desires no Trumpet to sound before you, yet doubtlesse I shall do you right other∣wise, if I acquaint the world with your vertues, and that you are one of that small number which in this sordid and phanta∣sticall Age loves true and solid Learning, not being carried away with the vain whimzies of brainsick Sciolists, whose learning and piety consists in shaking the

foundation of both, esteeming that buil∣ding strongest which is erected on stubble and straw: but let them aloue with their brittle and sandy ground-work, Old Truth is that sure Rock against which Hell gates shall not prevail. I have ad∣ventured to consecrate this small piece to you, as one who is truly acquainted and affected with the Old and True princi∣ples. In this Dedication I have endea∣voured to discharge my selfe of ingrati∣tude and oblivion, and to testifie to the world how much I am indebted to you, which I will alwayes thankfully acknow∣ledge so long as I am
Sir,
