TO thee that art Arts louer, Learnings friend,
First causer and collectour of these floures:
Thy paines iust merit, I in right commend,
Costing whole years, months, weeks, & daily hours.
Like to the Bee, thou euery where didst rome,
Spending thy spirits in laborious care:
And nightly brought'st thy gather'd hony home,
As a true worke-man in so great affaire.
First, of thine owne deseruing, take the fame;
Next, of thy friends, his due he giues to thee:
That loue of learning may renowme thy name,
And leaue it richly to posterity,
Where others (who might better) yet forslow it,
May see their shame, and times hereafter know it.
