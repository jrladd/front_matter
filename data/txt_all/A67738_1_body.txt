My Lord,
FRom the great Incouragement your Lord∣ship hath been pleased to afford me, in those indefatigable Pains you have ta∣ken in the Survey of several Rivers, and contriving with me effectually which way these might be rendred so far Navigable, that the Publick might thereby receive a general Advan∣tage, I am emboldened to make my humble return of Thanks in this small Dedication; in which should I (as the usual Custom is) enumerate your Lordships Favours wherewith you have been plea∣sed to honour me beyond my Desert, although in so doing I should only discharge my Duty, yet the captious Reader would be apt to mis-interpret my grateful Acknowledgments for crafty Insinua∣tions,
as if design'd only to court your Noble Pro∣tection: And by declaring to the World how far your Lordship hath dived into these Mysteries of Navigation, and what a fair Prospect you have given your Country of the great Profit necessari∣ly arising from those Ʋndertakings, I should give my Adversaries occasion to suspect, that I make use of so unquestionable a Testimony for one part of my Book, meerly in design to wheedle them into an easier credence of the whole. But I hope Your Lordship is assured, that I have a greater vene∣ration for your Honour, than to make a Stale of either your Name, Favour, or Authority; or that I should presume to abuse them on any occasion, as young Swimmers do their Bladders, with which they too too often boldly adventure beyond their depth. I know indeed some speculative Gentle∣men have of late plunged themselves so far into the deep, that they have not only sunk in their Ʋndertakings to their everlasting reproach: but their Ignorance buoyed up with Pride being the only thing that hath been able to keep above water, they have given the World sufficient Tests of the vast difference betwixt Speculative Notions and Pra∣ctical Experiments. But what I here Present Your Lordship hath been for the most part alrea∣dy
experienced in Neighbour Nations, and the rest sufficiently proved, by such undeniable Demonstra∣tions, that I doubt not in some few Years to see England (in spight of my Opposers) a flourishing Kingdom. Which, together with Your Lordships pardon for this rude Address, and the continuance of your Favour to protect me in this bold Ʋnder∣taking, is all that is aimed at, or desired by,
My Lord,
