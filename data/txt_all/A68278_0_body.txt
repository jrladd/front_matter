YOu that with friendly grace of smoothed brow
Haue entertained the Scythian Taburlaine,
And giuen applause vnto an Infidel:
Ʋouchsafe to welcome (with like curtesie)
A warlike Christian and your Contreyman.
For Christs true faith indur'd he many a storme.
And set himselfe against the Man of Rome.
Ʋntill ase treason (by a damned wight)
Di all his former triumphs put to ight,
Accept of it (sweete Gentles) in good sort,
And thinke it was preparde for your diport.
