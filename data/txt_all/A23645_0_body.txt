Honourable Patriots,
TO avoid the Penalties of your late Act, many received the Sacra∣ment of the Lords Supper, that never did before, and peradven∣ture never will again: I judge so, because I

have heard of some murmuring at the Sub∣scription therein required. Whereupon I adventured to publish this short Account of TRANSUBSTANTIATION, for their better satisfaction. We see the Nation divided about Matters of Religion; and we know the danger of a Kingdom divided against it self, except speedy remedy be ap∣plied. Toleration is a pretty Anodyne, that may ease our Distempers for a time, but will never make a perfect Cure. And Physitians observe, That violent Medicines never did good upon stubborn Humours. For remedy of such Evils as now we are endangered with divers eminent persons have given their advices.
First, Some famous Princes, Peers, and Prelates of our own Nation.
Secondly, A famous Parliament, in a Mes∣sage to their King, tell him, That the onely way to suppress Heresie and Schism, is to follow the example of the Primitive Church, &c. There is (say they) a Root to be til∣led; and if that be done, we may hope to en∣joy the sweet fruits of a firm and lasting

Peace. But if this be neglected (make what Laws you will) Heresie and Schism will en∣crease, and Divisions grow daily wider and wider.
Thirdly, The famous Council of Chalce∣don called by Martianus the Emperour a∣gainst Eutyches, hath taught us to remove one main hinderance of peace out of the way.
If the great Affairs of the Kingdom will permit, You may do something for the Church of England, that will not only stop the mouths of Evil Speakers, but also allure all Conscientious Dissenters to return home again to their Mother, whom they forsook, before they knew her. The great God, and disposer of all things, send his blessing upon all Your Consultations, that they may be to His Glory, the Honour of our Gracious So∣vereign, and the Peace and Welfare of our Countrey.

October 1673.
