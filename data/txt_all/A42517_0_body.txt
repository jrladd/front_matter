My Lord,
IT has been none of the least Arti∣fices
of those of the Church of
Rome, to recommend their Re∣ligion
to the World, by denying
a great part of those Abuses which
the Protestants have charged upon it;

and ascribing that to the meer Inven∣tion
of their Adversaries, which at
the same time all, who have ever lived
in those Countries in which Popery
prevails, cannot but know, is every Day
practised among them.
I am sufficiently sensible how little
need there is for Me to say any thing
in Answer to this Pretence, which has
been so fully and solidly Confuted in
so many Learned Discourses as the
late Times produc'd upon this very
Argument: And which ought to make
them for ever ashamed of such Expo∣sitions
and Representations of their
Doctrin, as shew rather what the Au∣thors
of them would have their Reli∣gion
thought to be, than what indeed
it is. But yet having had some Oppor∣tunities
by my long Conversation
among them, to Observe more, and
penetrate farther into their Mysteries,

than Those who have been always
Strangers to their Communion can
well be supposed to have done; I
thought it might not be altogether Ʋse∣less
to Communicate my Reflections
to the World; and shew what Popery
is not in the smooth Descriptions of
Designing Men, but in the Open Pra∣ctice
and Profession of it, in those
Countries where they Act without Dis∣guise,
and look upon themselves to be
the truest and most Zealous Observers
of it.
This, My Lord, was my Design in
Publishing the following Discourses:
And it is this that emboldens me with
all Humility to present them to Your
Grace, who is so great a Judge, and so
proper a Patron of such an Under∣taking.
It is, My Lord, Your Honour to
Govern a Church, than which none has

ever approved it self more firm to the
Protestant Interest; or better deserved
to be esteem'd, what by all Ʋnderstand∣ing
Men it is allow'd to be, the strongest
Bulwark against Popery. But it is
much more, so to have been thought
worthy of such a Station, by Princes so
Wise and Discerning, and so affectio∣nately
concern'd for the Churches Good.
And it ought not to be wondred, if all
Men desire his Patronage, whose Ver∣tues
are no less Illustrious than His
Character.
But, My Lord, this was not all the
Reason I had, for desiring to prefix so
Great a Name to my Present Ʋnder∣taking.
I am well aware, that in the
following Relations many things will
occur which may perhaps appear a little
Strange to the Vulgar Reader, and will
hardly gain Credit with those who do not
know how great the Extravagances of

Those of the Other Communion are,
when they act freely, and according
to the true Principles and Genius of
their Religion. And Travellers, as
well as Poets, are commonly look'd
upon to be priviledg'd Persons;
whose business it is to set off their Sto∣ries
to the best advantage, and especi∣ally
when they write to such as they
think are not able to confute their Pre∣tences.
But I hope when it shall be
consider'd to whom I have adventur'd
to present these Discourses, no man
will after that presume to Question
the fidelity of them; Or think I
should have durst to intitule your
Grace to any thing that I was not
sure would bear the strictest Exami∣nation.
May it therefore please your Grace
who have so often and Gloriously tri∣umph'd
over the Errors of the

Church of Rome in your own Writ∣ings,
now to give a new force, by the
Authority of your Name, to what
is here produc'd against them. A
Name as Venerable to all true lov∣ers
of their Country and Religion,
as Terrible to Those who bear a se∣cret
Enmity to Either; and know
both how well Able your Grace is,
and how Vigorous they have reason
to fear you will be, to discover and
defeat their designs against both.
And may that God, who has been
pleased to raise up so great a sup∣port
to his Church, at a time when
it never more stood in need of the
Wisest Conduct, long continue to
render you a Publick Blessing to it:
And when you shall late have fini∣shed
your Course with Honour here
on Earth, translate you to a more
Exceeding and Eternal weight of

Glory in Heaven, Which is the
most sincere and ardent Vow of Him
who with all possible Duty will al∣ways
remain,
My Lord,
Your Graces
Most Humble and
most Obedient Servant
