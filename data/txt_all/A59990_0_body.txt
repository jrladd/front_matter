SIR,
THough the severity of the times took a∣way those dramatique recreations (whose language so much glorified the English Scene) and perhaps looking at some abuses of the common Theaters, which were not so happily purg'd from scurrility, and under-wit, (the onely entertainment of vulgar Capacities) they have outed the more noble and ingenious acti∣ons of the eminent stages; The rage yet hath not been Epidemicall, there are left many lovers of this exiled Posie, who are great Masters of reason, and that dare conscientiously own this musicall part of Humane learning, when it is presented without the staines of impudence and profanation.
Among these persons, sir you deserve an honora∣ble inscription. For my own part; this is the last which is like to salute the publique view in this

kind, and I have onely to say, that I Congratulate my own happiness to conclude with so judicious a Patron.
To make a doubt of your fair receiving this piece: were to dishonor your Character, and make my self undeserving. Read at your leisure, what is humbly presented to your eye and judgment, while I pre∣serve my confidence in your vertue and good thoughts upon
Sir,
