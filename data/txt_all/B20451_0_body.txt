IF it were not unbecoming confi∣dence, (Most Eminent of Kings!) in Hugo Grotius, who at most did owe Your Illustrious Uncle Lewis the Thirteenth, but a topical and temporary obedience, to dedicate his Book De Jure Belli & Pacis, to him, founded upon such feigned and inconsistible principles, because written for Justice: Then will it not ill become a natural Subject of Your Majesties, who by all divine and humane laws owes an indelible character of obedience to Your Majesty, to implore Your patronage of Justice, founded upon the true and genuine causes. Nor is there any attribute of Justice
 which Grotius there ascribes to Your Uncle, but is as properly or more due to Your Majesty. For, if Lewis were just, because above any thing which might be spoken, he did honor the memory of the great King his Father, by imitating him; how just then is Your Majesty, when as not all the storms of adverse fortune in Your Father or Self, could ever any ways shake the constant veneration You have always paid his Saintlike memory, by imitating him; whereas pro∣sperity did almost ever fill the sails of Your Uncle and his great Father! If he were just, because he did in∣struct his Brother by all means, but most by his own example; then is not Your Majesty less just, who by all means, but most by Your own Example, hath so well instructed Your Brethren, that they in all respects answer the dignity of their high extraction, and whose eminent Virtues have attained such a height of perfection, that they are justly celebrated all over Christendom with admiration! If he were just, because he did adorn his Sisters with highest matrimonies; (yet certainly it was rather the felicity of his fortune, then acts of his justice, that he was by the marriage of his Sisters allied to all the greatest Hereditary Princes of Christendom:) how just then is your Majesty, who hath so adorned Justice and Piety, that as being by nature wedded to these (though born one of the greatest Princes of the Western world) You have preferred them before the enjoyment of Three Kingdoms! If he were just, because he did call back the almost buried Laws, and opposed him∣self to a Generation making haste into worse: Who then can express Your justice, who hath recalled our
 buried and almost forgotten Laws, and who with most manifest danger, yet by Providence miracu∣lously preserved for your Subjects deliverance, did oppose your self against the Tyranny of the most perverse generation of men that ever pretended to be Christians! If he were not only just, but also clement, whenas he took from his Subjects, who by ignorance of his goodnes had transgressed the bounds of their duty, nothing but the liberty of sinning, nor did force their consciences differing from him in Re∣ligion: Let the world then judge and admire your justice and clemency, who of your own accord does refer the most perpetrated villany committed in the sight of the sun, upon the person of your Royal Fa∣ther, not by your Subjects ignorant of his and your goodness, but by those who had known his clemency and goodness, and in the worst of their wickedness needed not have despaired of his favor, to those of your Subjects neither convened nor elected by your authority! And are so far from taking any thing from your peccant Subjects, more then liberty of sinnng, that you admit of a restitution to those of your Sub∣jects, who by such undue means had invaded the sacred patrimony of Gods Church, and your Crown. And though these things were committed upon pre∣tence of Religion; yet so tender is your Majesty, that you will force no mans conscience, not of these men! And if it were justice and mercy in your glori∣ous Uncle, in the prosperity of his fortune to relieve oppressed people and Princes by his authority; then was it no ways less justice and mercy in your Majesty, that in the adversity of your fortune, you did by all
 means endevour by your authority to relieve the op∣pressed and distressed Princes and people of Chri∣stendom.
To You therefore, Great Sir! being the Fountain and Centre of Justice in these your rightful Domi∣nions, in the lowest posture of humility, do these Observations and Elements presume to offer them∣selves, though not upon any confidence of them∣selves, or Author, but because wten for and in defence of Justice. To You, Sir, who by an indiffer∣ent administration of just, received and known Laws, and moderating the severity of them, (Your Majesty being their Moderator, as well as Arbitrator) where it becomes impossible for your Subjects to fulfil them, or inconvenient to Your self, or Subjects, in rigor to execute them, (if it be not your Subjects fault) shall not less, under God, confer peace and happiness to all sorts of them, then the Sun by its effluence does diffuse life and light to all the various creatures of the Universe. This is it, which in time will reduce your wandring Subjects to the secure and known paths of their Allegiance, out of which they have gone astray: This is it, which will secure you from the imputation of Tyranny, and convince your adversaries that it is not your fault in governing, but theirs in disobeying, if hereafter they bring upon themselves the miseries and calamities of another Civil war: And this is that, which will evidence to the world, that then your adversaries became enemies to your Royal Father and Self, when they first trod under foot the establish∣ed and received Laws of their Country; and that it is, and always was the desire of Usurpers, who having
 no just title but new Oppression, to introduce more new Inventions of their own, in place of the old Laws. This is it, which after your Majesties gracious Act of Oblivion for crimes past, will so settle the minds of your Subjects, that in the known ways of their ancestors, they may ex∣pect favor and protection from your Majesty. This is it, which will so genuinely and equally support your Majesties Title, that as it is so derived from the loins of innumerable Royal Ancestors, as no man can shew where it began, and so clear, that in the world no man presumes to stand in competition with You; so is it sup∣ported by received Laws of that continuance, that they have lost their first original.
I presume not, Sir, to say this of mine own head, to advise your Majesty, much less have any diffidence of your Majesties governing your Subjects any other way then by the established and received Laws of the Nation, where mens vices and depraved manners do not require new ones: I designe no more then to demon∣strate, that it was not your Majesties Father's, and your own adherence to the established Laws, but the iniquity of the times, which made him a Victim, and your Sacred self an Exile. Nay, in reason, as well as justice, it had been a most imprudent thing in either of your Majesties to have given up the Laws to the arbitrary lusts of your Adversaries, or any one Faction: For, should either of your Majesties have indifferently renounced the Laws to your Adversaries, being compounded of such differ∣ent and contrary humors and affections, then there was no visible means under Heaven to have cemented them, and by consequence your Adversaries hostility and con∣fusion continued, and your own conditions no ways
 bettered or secured: Or should either of your Majesties have renounced the Laws, to have advanced any one Faction so above the rest, and all your loyal Subjects, that their arbitrary wills and lusts should have been the laws of all the rest, and your other Subjects also; yet should you not only have failed to have contented that Faction, (it being the nature of Faction, never to bear any grateful acknowledgment for benefits received, but on the contrary always abuse them to their prejudice from whom they received them, and never rest until they have made themselves all, and their Benefactors nothing at all, or vile and miserable) but have animated all the other Factions against your Majesties and it.
To the fulfilling of all singular and glorious Virtues in Your Sacred person, is added Your being a Christian King, and a Nursing Father of the Church of Christ; and as if immediately sent from Heaven to cure and repair the wounds of this most miserably distracted Church, although Your Majesty is descended from in∣numerable Royal Ancestors, who have been Nursing Fathers of Christs Church; yet are you not derived from any who have had the least hand in the late Sacri∣lege thereof. And though, Sir, You are and ought to be a Nursing Father of Gods Church, and a Patron and Defence against her ravenous and devouring Ad∣versaries, yet none of mortal men have been more Re∣ligious Sons of the Church, then Your Majesty, and Your Saintlike Father.
How unequal, and how unjust then have been the sufferings of Princes so just, so religious, caused by Chri∣stians, Your natural Subjects, and these pretending Conscience? whereas no School teaches men a better
 lesson of obedience to Princes, then the Christian faith; whenas the first principle or foundation of Subjects o∣bedience to rightful Princes, is founded in the Law of Nature; however popular Orators and Atheists have, against all sense, reason, nature, and all authorities of sacred and profane History, resolved it into the pacts and wills of men. And conscience always supposes some superior law informing men to do, or not do a thing, or suffer, when any subordinate power commands con∣trary to it; whereas Your persecutors pretending con∣cience, trod underfoot whatsoever might be called sacred, to the attaining their seditious and sacrilegious ends.
That God in his providence doth often permit the good and just to suffer persecution, is evidently seen in all ages and places: But in reason and prudence, neither Your Majesties Father's, nor Your own adherence to the established Government of the Church, and the Rites, Liturgy, and Means thereof, in Your adversities, when they were so zealously persecuted by its and Your adversaries, could be any cause thereof: Neither would the desertion of it, have any ways conduced to either of Your Majesties advantage; for, should either of Your Majesties have renounced the Church and rites thereof, so as to have been a Christian King of such Miscreants, who (besides that they would not be of any Christian Church or society) had by undue ways devoured the patrimony of the Church; yet no man in his right wits could have imagined such men would long have been governed in peace, or that all other men of their factions would have been content, who had not made a prey thereof; and there was not sufficient to content all, nor indeed any at all; or that the canine appetites of those
 men who had devoured the lands of the Church, would not also have hungred after those of the Crown. Or should Your Majesty have advanced any one Faction so above the rest, that it should not only have tyrannized over the rest of the Factions, but also Your Majesty and the rest of Your subjects; yet could it not in reason have been expected, that this Faction (who by all Divine and Humane laws were subject to a Government, founded upon our Saviour and his Apostles, and by a continued series dispersed over the face of Christianity, until of late it became violated in some places of Europe by seditious and sacrilegious men) should so unjustly cast off their obedience so rightfully due, and yet expect that their wills and lusts should long be received for Laws by the rest of the Factions, and all other of their fellow-subjects. But certainly, Your constant adherence to the Church, did proceed from the power and grace of God in You, before any prudential or moral cause.
Notwithstanding that your Majesty is so constant a Preserver of Christs Church, and Propagator of Chri∣stian religion, and that your own conscience hath been so often attempted to be violated (by men of none at all indeed;) yet so tender is your Maiesty of other mens, that you will not force the conscience of any of your sub∣jects, pretending it. A strange condescension, any one will judge, who considers the parties granting, and ex∣pecting: For, should your Majesty command your Subjects any thing in derogation to the Majesty of God, or forbid them the worship and service of God, your Subjects might then justly plead conscience, because the duty and allegiance which they owe to God, is in the first place to be paid by all his creatures: Or should your
 Majesty command any thing which were immoral or unjust, as that your Subjects should dishonor your Ma∣jesty or their Parents, &c. they might justly plead con∣science, because that for Subjects to honor their King, and children their Parents, is founded in Nature, and is a Law of God engraven in the minds of all mortal men; or should your Majesty have lived in the Primeve times of Christianity, when men by the light of Humane Nature apprehending a Deity to be publickly Wor∣shipped and Served, yet being ignorant of the manner, misplaced it in Osyris, Isis, Iupiter, Apollo, an Oak, &c. then to have compelled them to have Worshipped God after the manner of Christians, had been unconsciona∣ble and unchristian, because they paid an acknowledge∣ment of that Worship due to God by Nature, and could not by Nature apprehend this, but must wait upon God, until (that by the ordinary means of the Church, or su∣pernaturally inspired by God,) they should be converted thereunto: Or should your Majesty command any thing in derogation to Christian Faith or Religion, they might plead Conscience, because the Obedience they owe thereunto is superior to all Humane Laws: But when as God is to be publickly Worshipped, and your Majesty obeyed by the light of Humane Nature; whenas he that heareth, and obeyeth not the Church, is to be ac∣counted an Infidel and Heathen man; and neither your Majesty nor Church enjoyning any thing contrary to the Law of Nature, or Gods Will revealed in Scriptures, but conformable to these; for men, your natural Subjects, and Born and Baptized in a Christian Church, in contra∣diction to all these, to plead Liberty of Conscience, to be Atheists, Hypocrites, and Schismaticks, is such a mon∣strous
 Paradox, as is not imaginable should proceed from reasonable creatures, not aiming at some further mischief: And when your Majesty shall with bleeding tears reflect upon the manners of these men thus preten∣ding Liberty of Conscience, you will finde them never to have made any conscience of Liberty, their Manners no whit better then their Religion? but as great enemies to Humane Society, as Christian Religion: For they no sooner, upon pretence of Liberty of Conscience, got licence of action, but what followed; Rapine, Plunder, Sequestration, Sacriledge, Regicidism and Murder, up∣on the Estates of the Church, Crown, and the Sacred Person of your Royal Father, and the principal members of Church and State, who were your best and most Loy∣al, and their Fellow-Subjects: when as by the Law, or Light of Nature, no man ought to do that willingly to another, which he would not have done to himself. Nor is this humor only Topical, or confined within the limits of your Dominion; but wheresoever men would not pay the Duty they ought to God in the first Table, they have never better perform'd that to their neighbor in the second, although it hath not pleased God to permit them to attain such a degree of Impiety, as here in your Maje∣sties Dominions; and your Majesty may believe it, that the times are changed, not these mens manners and dis∣positions, to attempt the like again whensoever they get an opportunity; however, these things at present will be better cured by your Majesties Christian Patience and example, then by your severe Execution of the establish∣ed Laws against them; yet if the Laborer be worthy of his Hire, then is he who is Hired worthy to Labor; and these men who pretending Conscience, neglect or
 refuse to perform the Duties of the Church, are utterly unworthy the Means of the Church.
Mans necessity is Gods oportunity: It is Gods usu∣al way in his Providence (doubtless to manifest the great∣ness of his Power to us Mortals here below) when mens extremities are at the highest, then to relieve them, ha∣ving, it may be, the least reasons or hope to expect it; and indeed what less then the power and grace of God in a Christian Prince, so Religious, so Just, so Merciful, and so descended, at such a time, could have cured the wide wounds of our miserable Church, and distracted State? D'avila reports of Coligny the Admiral of France, that he would usually prefer himself before Caesar or Alexander, because they acquired greatness by prosperous Fortune; whereas notwithstanding that Fortune was always ad∣verse to him, he still rose more formidable and terrible to his adversaries: Sure it is an admirable thing, that af∣ter all the adversity of your Affairs, God should without force or blood, exalt your Sacred Head above the Storms and Waves of such Enemies, who had neither Religi∣on, Law, Justice or Reason, but only force and blood in stead of, and against these, to maintain their Cause.
It cannot but be a consolation to any man in adver∣sity, rightly considering, how God (in the ordinary na∣ture of things,) does afflict men who place happiness in things of this world, and reward the afflictions of men (especially who suffer for a good Conscience) even in this world; for no man placeing happiness in things here below, can so enjoy them, but necessarily a time will come when he shall say, I take no pleasure in them; and then it will be miserum fuisse beatum; whereas other men who are afflicted, and suffer persecution, are no ways
 affrighted at the terrors of death, but rather with joy ex∣pect happiness in another world, after they shall be freed from the cares and troubles of this; or if it pleases God to free them from their afflictions here, then they truly convert miserum fuisse beatum, into beatum fuisse miserum. Besides your Majesties individual happiness in making so right construction of your precedent affections, and the advantages you have acquired by your severe education therein; your Subjects (like men who have been long sick, will better learn to esteem health) from their many suf∣ferings in your absence, will for the future learn to set a truer estimation upon your Prosperity and Presence. And may the God of Peace, the God of Mercy, and the God of Justice, so Crown the antecedent adverse fortune of You, Sir, the most Peaceable, the most Merciful, Just, and best of Princes, that being as Good and Just as Trajan, and as Devout and Religious as Constantine the Great, or Theodosius the first, you may be of your Sub∣jects as beloved as was Augustus, and the Arbitrator of Christendom, as well as Defender of the Christian Faith: And when this your Diadem shall descend to your next Heir, you may then assume a Celestial one, which shall never be subject to time, variation, or chance: Which is, and always shall be the daily Payer of,
SIR,
