MAster Burton, as you are a man I altogether vnknowne to me, but onely by your writings, so I am not desirous to bee your aduersary in any the least point of truth; I loue you in the truth; and I oppose you in loue of the truth; And if you can soundly and sub∣stantially conuince me of vntruth; I pro∣fesse before God and the world, that I will yeeld vnto you without any more adoe: being already willing to bee ouercome of the truth in this cause: You need not dis∣claime the match; I suppose my selfe your

equall for time, studies, or labour; and if your desire be sincere, onely to finde out the truth; Loe, I am as you are: Passe by our Reuerend Diocesan; and let me beare the brunt of this skirmish: Your victory shall be great enough; and your foile farre more easie and tolerable.
