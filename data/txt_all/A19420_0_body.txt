THat neither this poore and weake seruice which is heere to be offred to the Church of Christ, nor the memorie of his faithfull Martyrs which in this small Briefe I en∣devor to reviue, and celebrate, might bee the lesse esteemed of the good, or any way vilified of the bad, by comming abroad without the Patronage and pro∣tection of some person of Emi∣nencie in the sayd Church: it was needfull for me most Noble

Lady, to make choyse of such a Patron as for Eminencie of place, and vertues, might hue large romth in the hearts of the for∣mer; and also whose sole autho∣ritie might suffice to put to si∣lence the jgnorance of the foo∣lish. All which meeting togea∣ther in your Grace, my humble sute is, that through your Prince∣ly hands this poore Mite may now be cast into the Lords Trea∣surie. Wherein your Grace shall walke in her Royall stepps, who (though dead,Qu: Eliz. yet now seemes to liue in you) by her sacred hands did first consecrate the lar∣ger volume, whence this Epi∣tome is extracted, to the vse of the Church and people of God.
Be pleased then most Gratious Lady (for the matter belongeth vnto you) to receiue vnder your favorable protectiō this Mirrour or memorial of the Martyrs, who living, had the protection of An∣gels: and when the Lord shall haue perfourmed to your Grace

all the good that hee hath promi∣sed, and of all loyall hearts is ear∣nestly expected, it shall then bee no offence vnto your Princely mind that you haue so doone.
That great GOD who by his Omni-presence filleth Heaven and Earth with his Glo∣rie, fill and replenish your Graces heart with all the gifts and gra∣ces of his blessed Spirit; which may beautifie and adorne your person in the sight of God and Man in this life: and heereafter Crowne you with jmmortall Glorie for ever and ever in his Kingdome of Glory, Amen.
