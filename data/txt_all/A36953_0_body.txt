MY LORD,
WE being such a dull Gene∣ration of Men, as I think the like was never heard of before; I doubt whe∣ther there be many that take notice, as they ought, of that no less Pious than Ingenious Motto engraven under your Lordships Coat of
 Arms, DEUS NOBIS HAEC OTIA FECIT; which I would English thus in the Language of Scripture, This is the Lords doing; wherefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give Glory; supposing your Lordship would have it understood chiefly in that sense, though not excluding the other, which it may have. As for me, My Lord, I make it the Ordinary Text of my Daily Meditations, and so I conceive every man in these three Nations ought to do, from him who is the supreme Head and Governour over all, to the meanest and most inconsiderable Member of the Body. Surely it is God that hath restored the King to his Throne, the Church to her Rights, the Parliament to their Priviledges and Ho∣nour, and the whole Nation to its true Li∣berty. And it is through the favour of that good, wise and just God, that now, in the head City of this Kingdom, where not long since Loyalty was Treason, and true Piety Superstition, I may freely and safely, not only speak but set forth my mind in Print, in behalfe of the CHURCH of ENGLAND, under the Patronage of
 the Lord High Chancellor of the Realme.
Deus nobis haec otia fecit.
But yet, My Lord, although God be the principal Authour of this miraculous Restitution of all things amongst us, and his Invisible and Almighty Hand hath seldom appeared more visibly, or wrought more powerfully than in this most bles∣sed change, even to the astonishment of those that were Instrumental therein, who saw things succeed beyond their endea∣vours and expectation, (and some perhaps beyond their wishes and intentions too:) yet I say, My Lord, some instruments there were which God was pleased to make use of for that great work. He that un∣der God hath done the most in it, is with∣out all doubt the King himself, though he had contributed thereunto but that high repute of Justice, Wisdom, un∣daunted Courage, Constancy, and unpa∣rallell'd Goodness and Clemency, which His Majesty so deservedly acquired to Him∣selfe, even to admiration, during His af∣flictions, both abroad and at home, in the
 esteem of all men that observe His Royal Person, as well Enemies as Friends. Un∣der that high Heaven, that Primum mobile of all, there were less Orbs which moved their several wayes to attain this rest: And it cannot be denied but some of them have had very noble and succesful Mo∣tions, the propitious influence whereof we now enjoy to our unspeakable comfort, and their immortal glory. But truly, My Lord, we should be unjust to him, who, under the Kings most Excellent Majesty, is the common and most impartial Dispen∣ser of Justice and Equity unto all in the Nation, if we did not acknowledge, that your Lordships part hath been the chiefest. For, although your Lordships place was such, as that by it, like the Spring in a Watch, which moveth all, & is not so much as seen it self; your Lordship did act much more than the World knows, or is fit to be known, by reason of the mysterious managing of State-affairs; nevertheless we all know far more than, I am sure, your Lordships Mode∣sty will give us leave to speak. No man can be ignorant, that though the King is now
 the most accomplished Prince in the World, yet time there was that both His Age and the low Condition He was brought to, did need such a Wise and Faithful Counsellor, as the good Providence of God blessed Him with, when your Lordship was made to approach His Majesty. So great a Monarch was never put to so great straites. He was expelled His own Country, and bereaved of all, having not so much left as where to rest his Head in three great Kingdoms; and the might of His rebellious Subjects was come to such a height, that they thought themselves in a condition to say in Antichristian, that is, their own Language, We shall see no sorrow. And the truth is, they so long and so won∣derfully prospered, that in the apprehensi∣on of most men, both Friends and Foes, at home and abroad, they were looked up∣on as past all fear of being overthrown. Whence it was doubtless, that, most men being commonly led by their own Interest, His Majesty was so neglected for a long time by some of His Friends at home, and by His nearest Allies abroad. In that most sad and deplorable conjuncture, the King
 needed two men; the one a Terentius Varro, qui de Republica non desperavit, who when Hannibal was Master of all, yet was so strong∣ly perswaded of the good Fortune of Rome, that he did not despair to see her deliver∣ed out of the hands of so powerful an E∣nemy: the other a Fabius Maximus, qui cunc∣tando restituit Rem, who by temporising, and watching prudently for a good oppor∣tunity, shewing himselfe now and then to the Enemy, to let him know that he had yet an Opposite, at last overthrew him. The one to cherish and keep up the hearts of honest men; the other wise∣ly to improve all occasions to the best ad∣vantage.
I may truly say, My Lord, that your Lordship was both a Terentius Varro, and a Fabius Maximus to His Majesty. Nay, I may say, that your Lordship did go be∣yond them both, as indeed the difficulties you had to overcome, and the enemies to encounter, were far greater. Teren∣tius Varro is commended quod non desperave∣rit, in that he did not despaire of the good Fortune of Rome; and Fabius Maximus, in
 that he did not precipitate any thing, but warily and patiently waited for favou∣rable Junctures and faire Opportunities of doing his business. But your Lordship did not onely, non desperare, not despaire, but alwayes bene sperare, hope well, nay, never so much as doubted of the good Fortune of England, that is, of the Kings Restau∣ration, of which your Lordship ever spoke as of a thing infallible, in the worst of times, and when it seemed scarce possible to any man. And it was ever your Lord∣ships judgement, that time having made known the Usurpers, and brought the Na∣tion to a right understanding of themselves, all things would come about to that bles∣sed pass we see them now; That Subjects weary of being slaves under the vilest Ty∣rants that ever were, would remember the good Old Dayes; and knowing that they had a lawful Prince, whom God had adorned with such Royal Endowments as would certainly make them happy under his just Government, their own interest would force them to cast themselves down at His Majesties Feet, that they might
 have him to reign over them. So that it was chiefly required cunctare, to watch with Patience and Prudence, only letting the Rebels know, by appearing now and then, that they had a Master, who would call them one day to an account; And good Subjects, that they had a lawful and gra∣cious Soveraign, who was mindful of them. And thus it was, My Lord, that unus ho∣mo nobis, your Lordships most wise Coun∣sels by bringing in the King, and ending a long and most cruel Warre without bloodshed, did not only restituere, restore, but augere rem, encrease the glory and well∣fare of the Kingdom. For all which both we that are now alive, and they that shall succeed us in these now Fortunate Islands, must ever praise God and Honour your Lordships Name and Memory.
One thing more, My Lord, was necessa∣rie to the compleating of our happiness; That as our civil broyles ended peaceably, so our Controversies of Religion should be decided in the like manner, and our Temple built up anew, like that of Solo∣mon, without any noyse of Hammer or Ax, or
 any other tool heard about it. And it is known to all, and to those very men, who I fear will at last be judged on all hands wor∣thy to be called the Sons of strife, how great and earnest your Lordships endea∣vours have been, to bring all such dif∣ferences to an happy issue, nothing being more dear to your Lordship than the Peace of the Church. But as God when he had brought the Children of Israel into the promised Land, left amongst them some of the old Inhabitants, to be as Thorns in their sides; so it seemes he is pleased in his Wisdome that some Canaanites, I mean some Zelots, should still remain in this Land whither he hath brought his peo∣ple back, to be incentives to set us for∣ward in well-doing. Nevertheless I con∣ceive it the duty of all those who love the peace of the Church, to contribute what they can to procure it. Hence it is, My Lord, that I have endeavoured to do something that way, by shewing them who are not satisfied with our Church-Government and Publick Worship by Law e∣stablished, That they are the onely men in
 the World of all those that profess the Protestant Religion, who scruple to sub∣mit to the one, and joyn with us in the other; And that if they refuse to con∣form in all those things which are impo∣sed by lawful Authority upon all the Mem∣bers of the Church of England; they must likewise renounce the Communion of all other Reformed Churches, there being not one in all the World, but doth impose things of like nature, against which the same Exceptions may be made with as much reason; nay all and every one of those Ceremonies which are here impo∣sed, being also imposed in one or other of the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas; and all and more, in some of them, which yet are not therefore accounted Su∣perstitious in the judgement of other Chur∣ches which do not use the same.
Now, My Lord, many Reasons there are which have moved me to set forth this Essay of mine under your Lordships Patro∣nage. First, I certainly know that any thing tending to Peace and Unity in the Church, is most welcome to your Lorship. Next,
 though I confess that it is too mean a thing to be offered to a Person in so high a Place yet that great Bounty and Kindness of your Lordship, whereof I have so often had ex∣perience beyond the Seas, being nothing altered now at home; And that Prosperity wherewith God hath blessed your Lordship, both in your Personal, so well deserved Pre∣ferments, and in your Royal Alliance by that most accomplished Princess with one of the most Illustrious Princes under Hea∣ven, having not rendred your Lordship in any thing more haughty or less accessible, but that you are still the same to all your Servants; it might be thought an injury to your Lordship to entertain the least doubt, that it would not be acceptable by reason of its meanness. But the chiefest Reason I have, My Lord, is this, that it being my intention to contribute something towards the bring∣ing of those that stand yet at a distance from our Church, to a better understanding of her, and so to full Communion with her, I thought that I was to prefix no other name to my Work, but such an one as might be well liked of them all; And such is I
 conceive, or ought to be, your Lordships Name, unless they be the most ungrateful of all men. But I have trespassed upon your Patience and against the Publick Interest, by detaining your Lordship so long, for which I crave your pardon, humbly desi∣ring leave to entitle my selfe thus publickly with all due respect,
MY LORD,
