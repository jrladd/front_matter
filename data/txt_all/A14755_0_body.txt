THe Al∣tar
of In∣cense
was
compassed
aboutwith a
Crowne of pure Gold.Leuit. 3.

Gratitude is a rich, and
royall Vertue best besee∣ming
the best Princes,
which haue the best
meanes to expresse, and
the most cause to excite
them thereunto. The
meanest Subiect follow∣ing
the Mill, may bee
as thankefull as the grea∣test
Monarch sitting
vpon the Throne. But
between the effects of their
thankes, there is as broad
a difference, as betweene

the Acts of a Gyant, and
a Creeple, whose forti∣tude
may yet bee equall.
A priuate man praiseth
God vpon a tenne-strin∣ged,
a King vpon a ten-thousand-stringed
Instru∣ment,
vpon the lowd-soun∣ding
Organs, hauing so
many millions of Pipes,
as there bee men to whom
their Authoritie, or Ex∣ample
reacheth. The
fruites of Constantine,
Theodosius, and such

good Emperors gratitudes,
haue been Religion plan∣ted
and promoted, Chur∣ches
erected, Idolatrie
suppressed, wholesome
Lawes enacted, and exe∣cuted,
which makes Di∣uines
doubt whether such
Kings were well aduised,

in Storie, who vpon victo∣ries
obtained, not layed
downe onely, but wholly
layd off their Crownes,
and resigned their King∣domes

to God, not consi∣dering
they might better
haue paid their thankes
to him in kind, as Kings;
then in priuate deuotions
as Monkes. Dauid
was therefore a man af∣ter
Gods heart, not be∣cause
a King, but be∣cause
a thankefull King:
the sweet Singer of Isra∣el,
not for his Poetry or
Musicke, but for his
gratefull Hymnes com∣posed
and sung to Gods

praise vpon euery fresh
occasion; and hee calles
vpon Princes and Rulers
three times in one verse,
because they haue three
times the cause that Sub∣iects
haue, who haue but a
single share in those bles∣sings,
which ioyntly meet
in the head of Soueraign∣tie.
Hee often puts the
thorne to his Breast, as if
he found some obliuion
there, or vnwillingnesse:
Aug. in Psal. 145. quasi tacen∣tes inuenerit Angelos hortatur qui tamen nun-quam tacuerunt. yea, he often calls
vpon the Angell, eyther

implying the worth of the
worke, or else that the
best alacritie may admit
excitation.Aentas Syl∣uius, lib. 4. de di∣ctis Alphonsi. Alphonsus,
that renowned King, in
a speech to the Popes
Embassadour, professeth
he did not so much won∣der
at his Courtiers in∣gratitude
to him, who had
raysed sundry of them
from meane to great E∣states,
as at his owne to
God. How acceptable an
offering shall this bee to

God, if it may kindle
the least sparke, or ra∣ther
blow those coales al∣ready
flaming in your
royall Breast, or testifie
our gratefulnesse to him
for his infinite, old and
new fauours to your Ma∣iesties
Person, and
thereby in your King∣domes.
For all defects
in it, the Title pleades
Pardon, and Accep∣tance:
Euen GOD
himselfe allowed a Fe∣male

in Peace-Offe∣rings,
not admitted in o∣ther
kindes. Gratitude
hath set a price vpon
meane Presents. The
forme of a Sermon will
not disparage the subiect
matter. The best Mo∣numents
of Constan∣tines
Gouernment, is a
gratefull Sermon, recor∣ded
at large by Euse∣bius
in his tenth, whose
blessed, and much ho∣noured
dayes, God make

yours equall and exceed
in length and happinesse.
So humbly and heartily
prayes
