May it please your Lordship,
WHatever your Thoughts may be of all that can be called mine in this Work, I am certain you will approve of the design I had in
 making it publick; which was to sa∣tisfie the World, That there has al∣ways been a considerable visible Church upon Earth, that never be∣lieved the Doctrines of the Pope's Supremacy, Purgatory, Transub∣stantiation, Adoration of Images, Auricular Confession, &c. To which good End, if this Treatise should any ways contribute (as I am persuaded it must) I am then secure, that for that Reason alone you will pardon any Mi∣stakes I may have made in putting it together; as also the Presumption of inviting you to read it, by prefixing your great Name to it; a thing I should never have ventured to have done, had I not found by experience your Lordship's Candor and Goodness to be equal, to the known exactness of
 your Judgment. I beg your Lordship's Blessing, and am,
My LORD,
