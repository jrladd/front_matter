CHaste, and matchlesse VIRGIN, I might iustly be taxed to haue forgot my selfe doubly, at one time: as well, concerning my bounden duety towards your beauti∣ous selfe, as in respect of the many De∣serts, which that great Scholler learned Varchi, doth merit, if I should not (without lingring or temporising any longer) make a Present vnto the world, of this his admirable and dainty conceited Lecture, shadowed vnder your sweet and much prised Name; for then, like a malitious fore-stauling Merchant, I should engrosse vnto my selfe, that deare commoditie of Praise, which is onely due to such a worthy man alone, and like an vnthankefull person, shew but little, or rather nothing at all, how much I am beholding vnto you, as well in my thoughts, as in all other my proceedings whatsoeuer. Which Acknowledgement (although I must needes confesse I am to blame therein) enuiting, and as it were, wooing mee to make you some satisfacti∣on for my backewardnesse in this poynt, to which your

peerelesse Worth, and spotlesse Vertue draw mee on, and not knowing what fit course to take (considering I haue not (as now) any thing of mine owne, worthy of your gracious acceptance) yet hath it beene some com∣fort vnto mee, in that my minde giueth mee, that this Discourse following shall be sufficient to shew some part of my good meaning towards you: as likewise in some sort to satisfie the excellency of graue VARCHI'S selfe. And because I know that it is a meere vanitie of such, as praysing and extolling the Bountie and Goodnesse of God, imagine that by their many words (onely) they shall be able to commend it the more; therefore I hi∣ding and concealing the prayses of VARCHI, and of Monsigor De la CASA, will onely say, that they (both) will hold themselues sufficiently commended, when they shall vnderstand, that this their much wisht-for Treatise, shall be read and esteemed of, by such a prayse-worthy Creature as is your selfe, your admirable wit and sound Iudgement in euery thing, being such as you farre ex∣ceede any one of your sexe, and therefore, counted one of our Italian Paragons, and that not vnworthily. I there∣fore make bold, to present you with this deepe and ex∣cellent Oration or Speech, and relying vpon the won∣ted Affabilitie of your courteous Nature, desire to be commanded by the same alwayes.
