Mr. MAYOR,
THIS Sermon, which was first Preached, being now Printed at your Request, I shall make no Apology for it: I know a Plain Discourse will never please the Curious, and one for Peace will always be unwelcome to the Facti∣ous; and as I pretend not to gratify them, so I shall never endeavour to humour these.
My design in Preaching it, was to per∣suade People to lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty. And your desire of having it Published, implieth a Resolu∣tion of prosecuting this good End, and to con∣vince the unruly, That many things which are

Impertinencies in private Persons, are Du∣ties incumbent on a Magistrate.
SIR, You cannot shew your self a truer Lover of your Corporation, nor contribute more to its Happiness any other way, than by incouraging the Practice of True Religion, which will oblige Men to be useful in their Generations, by imploying their Hands more, and their Tongues less.
That your Town may thus flourish, by abounding in Love and every good Work, is the hearty desire of,
SIR,
