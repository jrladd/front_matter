SINCE MY LAST
translation to your good
Ladyshippe, I haue dispo∣sed
some part of my leasure to reueale
Monophylo, whose argument albeit
is not religious, and lesse exspectation
of graue things, in so vnquyet a state
of his, yet he brings foorth a Phylo∣sophie
no lesse morall and naturall,
then necessarylie tending to assure
our frayltie amydde many hidden mi∣series,
wherwith we stande enuyroned
by Gods necessary prouydence: wher∣in

by howe much he offereth helpe to
our infirmitie, as both by aduise, whose
reasons are inuincible, and priuate
experience which toucheth vs in ex∣ample:
by so much hee merites au∣thoritie
(although with some) his
precepts may seeme suspicious as tou∣ching
the subiect, and my howers im∣properlye
exercised, whose condition
requireth (in common wisedome) to
practise in matters of more benefite.
For the first, the Philosophers gene∣rallie
are to aunswere for mee, who
in their preceptes eyther of glorie, of
couetousnesse, to moue contempt of the
worlde, or in anye other cause ten∣ding
to instruct, reforme, or edifie, ob∣serued
in their doctrine, to decypher
the secret nature of thinges, the bet∣ter

to prepare their Disciples to the
highe knowledge of such matters as
they delyuered to them but by speech,
the same being the proper instrument
to perfection in science, as Erbes and
Symples rightlye compownde, are
readye Medecynes to remooue the
iniurye and disease of the Patient:
And for my selfe I alleadge the cor∣rupte
propertye of the tyme, whose
nature is intangled with such confu∣sion,
that in fewe men is founde con∣formitie
of opinion, and much lesse
to yeelde affection or meritte to the
honest indeuours of others, on whom
(eyther by malice or ignoraunce)
the most sort doe throwe manye nice
errours, according to their imper∣fect
fancies: But as I doubt not, but

Monophylo is able to bee hys owne
Champion, as being armed with loy∣altie
(the verye vertue in loue.) So
I stande not nowe to allure the popu∣lar
fauour (whose iudgement wan∣dereth
in reuolution and chaunge)
seing it is to your Ladiship, to whome
I offer the censure of my traueyle, and
in whome is no lesse discression to dis∣cerne,
then deepe modestie to pardon
or excuse: humblie beseeching you to
receyue this seconde exercise not as a
recompense worthie your last liberali∣tie,
but as a simple testimonie to con∣tinue
the reuerent duetie I owe you,
vntill I bring foorth my great woorke,
which I hope will more worthilie re∣semble
your highe vertues, and wyth
lesse mourmure drawe others to the

knowledge of GOD, to whome I
leaue the successe, and your good
Ladyshippe to hys holye feare:
At London, the sixt of
Aprill. 1572.
