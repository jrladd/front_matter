MY LORD,
IF the Present your Lordship here receives be consider'd only ac∣cording to its bulk, I must,

no doubt, lie open to the reproach of offering so mean a Sacrifice, at the Shrine of so noble a Name. But if the excellency of the Sub∣ject treated of be put into the o∣ther Scale, with this allowance, that whatever is offer'd derives its merit from the sincerity and de∣votion of the Offerer, I may more rationally hope the acceptance, than fear the rejection of it.
Your Lordship will find, in this small Treatise, the Frontispiece, or first Draught, of the boldest design that, haply, was ver undertaken in the Empire of Learning, to wit, THE ART HOW TO KNOW MEN; an Art,

comprehending what ever contri∣butes to the discovery of their most secret Inclinations, the Motions of their Souls, their Vertues and their Vices; an Art, which, if well studied, will bring to those who shall attain it, answerably to their several qualifications, the greatest satisfaction and advantages imagi∣nable.
For what greater can any one man frame to himself, than those, which accrue from his knowledge of another, even though they move in the meanest station of Affairs? But if those are so considerable, how much more must they be, which are made by persons en∣trusted

with the management of Embassies, and the most important Transactions of Crowns and Scep∣ters, and consequently, oblig'd to treat with People of different Tempers and Climates? In these last it suffices not, to be guided by those common observations and characters of men, which are ob∣vious to the Populace, and com∣monly mask'd and disguiz'd; but the grand secret is, to penetrate into the Closets, and insinuate into the very bosoms, of Princes and Favourites.
And this consideration it was, which the more inclin'd me, to make a particular dedication of

this Labour of mine to your Lord∣ships patronage. For whom could I expect more favourable to the ART HOW TO KNOW MEN, than One, who had so lately satisfy'd the world, how well he had studied it before? From whom could that Art look for a kinder reception, than from one who had shewn himself so much a Master of it, in carrying on a Ne∣gotiation, which led him, from the most, to the least-civiliz'd extremi∣ties of Christendom?
Your Lordship might here ex∣pect I should give some account of my Author, the Advancer of this so excellent and beneficial an Art;

but I refer what I have to say of him to another place, concluding here, after I have begg'd your Lordship's pardon for the rudeness of this Address, with an assurance, that it is made with the greatest respects and submissions, and, con∣sequently, that I am,
