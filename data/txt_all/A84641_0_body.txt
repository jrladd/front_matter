My Lord,
AMong many other choice passages of pleasant Histories, Aelian the Greek Histori∣an hath this, That a certain
 Musitian solacing himself with the melody of his mu∣sick wherein he was admi∣rably skilful, it fortuned that the Treble-string of his Lute broke; but his good luck was to have it supplied again by a Grashopper, that leaping upon his instru∣ment, gave her Note tune∣able to that string that was wanting. In this our publick and unparalleld time of joy, if the Spheres of hea∣ven could make musick to be heard by men upon the
 earth, God hath given us a season of mirth fit for such a melody; the Lord our God is with us, and the shout of a King is amongst us; it is now a time neces∣sary for every skilful and sweet singer of Israel, to bring his Harp to compleat the musick; if I come in but like this Musitians Grass∣hopper, to contribute a Treble-string, or what else might be more mean, it is glory enough for me; I am not nice to tune so well as I
 can: He that can offer an Hecatomb, here is an Altar of thanksgiving worthy such a sacrifice; and I that have but one grain of frank∣incense, will fling on mine also, the best that I can do I present to the World here a Genealogy of the Kings Sacred Majesty, his Royal Descent from all the Kings that have ever reigned in this Island, whereby the people may perceive how properly, rightly, legally, and intirely He is their
 own, whom they now thus joyfully receive; and I have annexed unto it a small Tractate for explanation of the Stem-Royal, for the help of those who are not versed in things of this na∣ture; together with other observations and applicati∣ons of such things that I thought needful.
These I here presume to dedicate to your Honours Patronage, which I humb∣ly beg that you would please benignly to accept
 of, and pardon my bold∣ness. Though I be a stranger to your Person, yet truly my Lord I must needs say I am very well acquainted with your worth; nemo fefellit omnes.
A good name, saith So∣lomon, is like a precious oyntment, we may smell the fragrancy, though we never see the person that carrieth it about him; as the spices of Arabia are said to be lushiously redo∣lent to those that are distant
 from it some hundreds of miles: The honourable de∣portment of your self hath justly made you conspicu∣ous and beloved over all our County of Lincoln, as appeared, when they so joy∣fully and numerously lately chose you for one of their Representatives in Parlia∣ment; and the sweet sent of this your noble worth, could not but come to me, though now aged and ob∣scure, & living in recess and retirement; I must needs
 further be so bold as to challenge the relation to be your honours poor neigh∣bour, in respect of some of your honours inheritances lying near us; and your late father of honourable me∣mory, was (though I being but once in his company) pleased to honour me with affectionate and earnest in∣vitation to come unto his house, and be better known unto him; but he changed this life for a better, before I could have opportunity
 to tender him my service. Though what I have here done be but mean, your ho∣nours name in the frontis∣pice will be my credit and encouragement further to serve you in any of my abilities, and to subscribe my self,
