THese Books of Constan∣cy, which I both began and finished in the midst of the troubles of my Country, I thought meet to dedicate, and devote to you; the great Sena∣tours of so great a City. Your Dignity, Prudence, and Vir∣tue, were the motives to it; to∣gether with that humanity of
yours which I have often expe∣rienced, and which is peculiar to you; towards all that are good and learned. You will not I suppose disdain the gift; which though small in it self, will derive a kind of value from the mind of the Donour: See∣ing I have given you the very best, and greatest of such things, as my Scholastical stores would at this time afford. To con∣clude, possibly the novelty of it may some way recommend it. For (if I am not mistaken) I am the first, who have attempt∣ed the opening, and clearing of
this way of Wisdom, so long re∣cluded, and overgrown with thorns; which certainly is such, as (in conjunction with the holy Scriptures) will lead us to tran∣quility, and peace. For my own part, I wanted not a desire, to render my thankful acknow∣ledgments to you; and to con∣tribute to the profit of others; if I have not had the ability, it is but reasonable, that you should be as equal to me, as I am to the great God; who I know hath not given all things to any one. Farewell.
