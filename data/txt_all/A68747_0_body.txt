To controll those false copyes of this ser∣mon,
which were printed without my
knowledge, (patched) as it seemeth out of
some borrowed notes,Gen. 43. 11. and to stop the prin∣ting
of it again without my corrections, as
it was intēded, because they had got it licē∣ced
before, although vt erly vnwilling for
some respectes to haue it published, whiche
made me withstand their importunitie so
long, yet seeing more inconuenience then I
thought of, I suffered that which I could
not hinder. And nowe hoping that it is
Gods will to profite some by it, as Iacob
parted from Beniamin, so that which
must be, let be, and the Lord giue thee a
blessing with it.
