Right Honorable,
AS the Lord Jehovah when he first chose Israel to be a peculiar people to himself, out of all the Nations of the world, did give unto them righteous Judges, Moses, Jo∣shua Gideon, Sampson, Samuel, &c. such as were after his own heart, and of his own raising up: So is it his promise to his people in the last days (before the dross of Sion shall be taken away, and her tin purged, and she called the City of righteousness, the faithful City) that he will restore their Judges as AT THE FIRST, and their Counsellors as AT THE BEGINNING, Isa. 1.25, 26.
How high the faith and expectations of Gods people of late years have been, as to the accomplishment of these things, is known to many, and what uncessant prayers have been put up to the Throne of Grace, for the same, is best known to the Lord. That you are raised up this day, to be the repairers of our breaches, and the restorers of paths to dwel in, is (we hope) the long expected, and much looked for fruit of this our faith and prayer; which as it doth cause rejoycing within many hearts, so hath it fixed the eyes of most upon you to observe what great thing that is which God by you is about to do for his poor people.
Not to teach you (Right Honorable) what is your work, but to declare what that is which the Lord in the age we
live in is about to do, and expects his people should eye and follow him in, is the design of this little Treatise, which although it had its conception some months since, and was then designed for other hands, yet could it not be brought forth until this day, in which it casts it self into yours, not so much seeking protection (for what is truth will stand of it self, and what is not shall fall, though by men protected) as that it might hereby become the more serviceable to that great interest it pleads for, in doing of which, the Author hath obtained whatsoever is herein his end, desire, or joy.
And now (Right Honorable) God having raised you up, and put into your hands so great an opportunity, let not the same be lost for want of any improvement which may be made thereof; this is your day to honor God, and serve your Generation; let this day slip, and it may be hereafter when you would do the thing, you shall not have a day to do it. Men, wise men, good men, have fallen before you, by putting off, and neglecting the work of their Generati∣on take Feed lest ye also fall through the same example of neglect; THE MORE EMINENT GODS HAND HATH APPEARED IN RAISING OF YOU, THE MORE NAKED AND REMARKABLE WILL IT BEE IN THROWING OF YOU DOWN, IN CASE YOU FAIL HIM, AS O∣THERS BEFORE YOU HAVE DONE. But I am perswaded better things of you (Right Honorable) and things that accompany diligence, though I am bold thus to speak: for surely the Lord, who in an extraordinary way hath brought you together, hath some work more than ordinary to do by you; wherein if you shall observe, mak∣ing it your business to follow him, ing justly, relieving the oppressed, helping the fatherless; eading the cause of the Widow, and walking humbly before him, though the Nations may rush against, you, as the rushing
of many waters, yet the Lord will rebuke them, and you shall be as a burdensome stone to all your Enemies round about, who shall weary themselves with you, though all the people of the earth should be gathered together a∣gainst you; for behold the day is coming, in which the hand of the Lord shall be known towards his people, and his indignation towards his Enemies, which when you shall see, your hearts shall rejoyce, and your bones shall flourish like an herb, and your tongue shall speak and say, Lo this is our God, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation: and when the light of this day is come, and the glory of the Lord shall be risen upon you, it shall then never repent you, that you have put your hands (though with your lives in them to the work of Christ, but whatsoever you have herein done or suffe∣red, shall now be your glory, joy, and Crown of rejoycing, which that you may at this day from Christ obtain, and in the mean time be faithful in his work, he shall continue to pray for, who is
