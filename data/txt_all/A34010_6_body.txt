My LORD,
ARTS, Sciences, and Vertu∣ous Inclinations being of a Noble Extract, and Divine nature, do hold much Analogy with our more Caelestial parts, (in which the Image of God is imprinted) and do speak great Pleasure and Satisfaction, as they are Per∣fective of our Humane nature in elevating our low Intellectuals, and refining our depraved Mo∣rals.
And I am much pleased in considering that Men of most Excellent parts, (who know how to value and treat the more noble Faculties of the Mind, and their precious hours) take most Delight in understanding the Causes of Things,
and the Wonders and Secrets of Nature; where∣upon I have taken the boldness to present your Lordship with many Notions of Experimental Philosophy, deduc'd from Anatomical Dissections, wherein you may have a fine sight of the Noble Fabrick of Man's Body, in which you may see your own Structure, and admire and adore the great Artifice of the All wise and Powerful Pro∣toplast, and pay a duty of the greatest Thanks and Obedience imaginable to His most Glorious Name for His Wondrous Works, Evidenced in Comparative Anatomy, in viewing the Parts of Varieties of Animals, how they partake Simi∣litude with, and Illustrate those of a Humane body, which is very useful to the advancement of Natural Knowledge, subservient to more Di∣vine and Christian Philosophy, consisting in many salutary Precepts and sober dictates of recti∣fied Reason (rendring us Happy) which your Lordship hath highly practiced and made you very valuable in the opinion of Wise men.
As you have confined your Appetites (in which Licentious persons are irregular) within due bounds, instituted by Nature, whereby they become proper instruments, as Incentives to sup∣ply our Necessities, and preserve Humane na∣ture.
Your Lordship hath made good in a great degree the primary obligations of Nature in your Piety to your Maker by speaking Obedience to His most Sacred Commands, and in Justice to your Neighbor in the observance of the Law of
Equality, and in Sobriety in reference to your Person, in the prosecution of wholsome Rules preservative of it.
Your Life of Piety, Justice, Temperance, Charity and Devotion, are very Exemplary, as you are a Person of Honor and Fortune, and will allure others to conform to so excellent a Pattern, which if generally imitated, would con∣serve Humane Society, and prove a great Bles∣sing to our Nation.
Your evenness and sweetness of Temper free from all extravagancy of Passion, do highly oblige all Persons that have the honor to converse with your Lordship. Your Generous and Hospitable disposition, (expressed in your Noble and Ami∣cable Entertainments) do invite and treat your Friends with all Civility and Kindness.
I cannot but Congratulate your Lordship in your most Excellent and Accomplished Lady, a Meet-help for you, being as near akin to you in Vertue, as Person, and gives a most kind re∣ception to all your Friends, which her Lady∣ship entertains with a pleasant Aspect, kind Lan∣guage, and most endearing Civility, which ren∣ders your House a Paradise to all your Acquain∣tance, and Strangers, that have the happiness to converse in it.
I take the boldness to present your Lordship with this mean Paper (as a small Token of my most humble Duty and most affectionate E∣steems) which I have affixed to the Chapter of Seeing, which I humbly beg your Lordship to peruse, as a most Noble Subject, Dedicated to
you, who are so Candid as to pardon all Defects, and so Favourable as to grant a Patronage to the Studious Endeavors of
My LORD,
