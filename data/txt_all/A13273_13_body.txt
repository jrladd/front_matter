HArdy and Happy may You long Succeed,
In all the Courses of your Christian Zeale,
To scourge Abuse; and purge the Publike-Weale,
Of vicious Humors, with auspicious Speed.
ardy and Happy Neuer more did need,
To meet with Malice, and with Might to deale;
And sift the Drift the Serpent would conceale.
How happy, Heav'n You for These times decreed!
Hardy and Happy may you still proceed,
Vntill You finde, confound, and suffocate,
The Viperous Vermin that destroy the State.
ardy, and Happy, be your Minde, and Meed
With GOD and Men: applauded and approou'd,
Of Prince and People; of All Good, belou'd:
