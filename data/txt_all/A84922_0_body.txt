MADAM,
THe designe of this Sermon being to possesse the minds of his Maje∣sties subjects, with such a just and avv full sense of the Divine Origi∣nal, and Supreme Dignity of Kings as may keep them within the bounds of their Duty and Allegiance to their natural Soveraigne, Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE'S most Glo∣rious Father now raigning, I have bin en∣couraged to make it publick: and since the Glorie of God, for which Your ROYAL
 HIGHNESSE has so great a Concern, and the service of the Crown, to which You are so nearly related, and which ought to be the studie as it is the duty of everie true English∣man, are the sole ends both of preaching and publishing it, I have taken the confi∣dence in all humility to present it to Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE not out of any opinion of its worth, but as a testimonie of my loyalty and dutiful affection to my Prince, and of that profound veneration vvhich I have for those divine Excellencies, vvherevvith God hath abundantly enrich'd Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE, and vvhich exact the utmost adoration that can be paid by one mortal to another, and vvhereby You are rais'd as much above others of an inferiour qualitie in the highest exaltation of everie vertue as You excel them in the High and Royal Dignity of Your Birth. This, MADAM, is the sense of all the world that have but so much as heard of
 Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE, and Your exemplarie Pietie, and constant attendance upon the publick worship of God, and humble demeanour at it, the regular and uninterrupted course of Your private Devo∣tions, Your sincere affection to the Church of England; Your Princelie Charity and Li∣berality to the afflicted, Your great Humi∣lity, Courtesie and Affability tovvards all, and vvhat ever is admired by the best men, or can render a Person Excellent and illu∣strious in the eyes of the vvorld, and vvhich shine forth every day more and more in Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE vvith a grea∣ter lustre; all these shovv that the vvorld is not mistaken in the high opinion it has of Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE, and that all that can be said of Your Vertues and Perfec∣tions vvil come far short of the truth: and those strangers vvho have only heard of them by common report, vvhen they come to be never so little acquainted vvith the
 truth of things, will be as much confoun∣ded, as the Queen of Sheba was when she came her self and heard the wisdom of Solomon, and savv the glory of his Court, there vvill be no more spirit left in them.
All these divine Graces and Dispositions of the soul together with all other both mo∣ral and intellectual Accomplishments, whe∣ther natural or acquired that are any vvhere to be found among mankind, being united in Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE, and joyn'd to the Beauties and Perfections of a Bodie, fit for the Reception and Habitation of so heavenly a Guest, vvith a carriage and de∣portment compounded of Humility, Good∣nesse and Majestie, do at once qualifie Your ROYAL HIGHNESSE for the highest place in the Calendar of Saints, and to fill a Throne vvithout any danger or diminution to the Brightnesse of Your Innocence. That Goodnesse vvhich is so natural to all Your August Family, and of vvhich Your ROYAL
 HIGHNESSE has so great a share forbids me to dispare of Your HIGHNESSE'S pardon for this great presumption, or of Your favou∣rable acceptance of this mean but sincerest Demonstration of my being,
MADAM,
