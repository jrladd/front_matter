May it please Your Majesty
TO permit me, most Thankfully, to Ac∣knowledge, That it is Your MAJESTIES very Gra∣cious
 Approbation of Ano∣ther Endeavour to revive the Decay'd Piety and Ver∣tue of the Age; which as it Animates me to proceed in that, and has almost brought it to Perfection, so it was the great Encou∣ragement of this. In which I have endeavour'd to per∣suade, and direct to the right use of this Blessed Sacrament; Which is per∣haps
 the best and most Effectual means that our Lord has left in his Church to promote and maintain in it the Love of God and of our Neighbour. And may it please Your Sacred MAJESTY to give leave, That I may Encourage my self from the Favour men∣tion'd, to Implore and Hope for the Honour of Your MAJESTIES Pa∣tronage
 to this Small Piece also. I am, and desire to be as long as I live,
