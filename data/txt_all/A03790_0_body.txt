RIght Honorable, the im∣portunitie of some good Christians
that heard this Sermon at the Crosse, ha∣uing ouercome mee to publish it
to the world; I haue presumed (vnworthy though it be) to present your
Lordship with it: as being the best meanes I had to manifest my dutie,
and how much I honour your Lordship: your zeale to true religion, your
honorable re∣spect and loue shewed to schollers, and to me in particular,
your vnworthy Chaplaine, makes me hope it shall find a fauourable
ac∣ceptation. The which if it shall please your Lordship to
grant, I haue a condigne coun∣terpoise of all my labour. Thus in all
hum∣blenesse crauing pardon for my boldnesse, with my dayly
supplications, that God would multiplie vpon you all temporall blessings
in this life, and eternall in the life to come, I rest
