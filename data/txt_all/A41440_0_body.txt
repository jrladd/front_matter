My Lord and Gentlemen.
IN Obedience to your Order, I here present You the Sermon which I lately Preached at your Cha∣pel: And although it hath never been my custome to Dispute your Commands in this Case; yet at this time, I think my self under a double obligation to comply with them: Partly, in regard that Your Lord∣ship by a sudden and dangerous Distemper of Body, was then disabled from affording your Presence at the Deli∣very of it; and partly in consideration of the seasona∣bleness of the Subject of this discourse, which I verily think to be such as may in a great Measure Atone for whatsoever defects there may be otherwise in the Man∣agement of it; and in that confidence, without further Preface or Apology; I commend it to Gods Blessing and your Candour.

May it please the Divine Majesty to restore Your Lordships Health, and therewith sill You with such a Measure of his Grace and Holy Spirit, as may inable You to adorn that great Station in which he hath placed You, till it shall please him to prefer You to an Higher in his own Kingdom.
And may all you the Worthy Magistrates of this Great and Famous City, live to see Jerusalem in its Glory; I mean, not only the Times wherein you live, Blessed with Peace and Prosperity, but the Church of God setled, and the Protestant Religion (which is no other than Primi∣tive Christianity revived in its native Purity and Sim∣plicity) firmly Established, which as it will be the great∣est Glory to this Age and the greatest Blessing to Poste∣rity; so that You in your Stations may be instrumen∣tal in so Glorious a Work, shall be the Hearty Prayer of
(My Lord and Gentlemen)
 Jan. 1st. 1688/9.
