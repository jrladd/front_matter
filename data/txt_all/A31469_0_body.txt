May it please your Grace,
TIs the just Prerogative of true Greatness to be universally admir'd by all; and one so Eminently possest of it as your Grace, can no more escape the Tribute of our Praise and Ad∣miration, than you can cease to deserve it; not that 'tis in the power of any one, or even the Ap∣plause of Multitudes, to reach half your Merit, yet may we be allow'd, according to the proportion of our poor stock, to throw in our Mite; and not be frightned from the hopes of your Grace's Patronage, by considering the unworthiness of the Offering; for were none but worthy Offerings made, the Gods themselves wou'd lose their Sacrifice; and they that deserve most our Praise shou'd have it least, because 'tis hardest to give them their due.
And 'tis impossible, my Lord, this Poem shou'd find Sanctuary any where but in the umbrage of your favour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are so fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a disappointment to the publick to lay at any others door, what is so much your due. And tho I hit not a Wildair for

the humour of the Town in my Play, I may boldly say I have copied the greatest part of mankind in the Just Admiration of your Grace.
Your particular Art, in appearing Free, Complai∣sant and Conversible, without quitting a Noble Greatness proper to your self, makes us at once ap∣proach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodness, that makes you stoop to your Inferiours, loses nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we consider your Grace arriv'd at the height of Greatness, without a mortifying reflection on the lowness of our own condition; nor does the world envy the truly Great, who by their Goodness and Affability make Man∣kind partake of their Felicity.
I may plead Prescription in excuse of this pre∣sumption, and tell how Poets in all ages have pre∣tended a Right to lay their Works at some Noble∣man's feet; but I'd rather submit to your Grace's Goodness; for if I have offended, 'tis a fault of the best kind, and proceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,
My Lord,
