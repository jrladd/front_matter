THe following Discourse I receiv'd from you in French; I will not put such a Construction as I might up∣on your sending me the En∣tertainments of a Man in the Dark, or at best but in Moon∣light; I will only say, that as they were his Diversion in the Country, so I made them

mine. But when I consider'd his Chimerical Design (let us suppose it such) of inlarging the French Monarchy beyond the Moon, (for all Discoverys of the Subject belong to the Sovereign;) I grew jealous of the Attempt, and concern'd for the Honour of our Nation, we have hitherto outdone the French by the Progress of our Arms in this World, why should we fall short of them in our Discovery of others, when a Chimera will do the business. I have therefore rectify'd his French Telescope the best I could for the use of an Eng∣lish Eye, and recommend it first to yours as the best Judge,

that I know, of what may be perform'd by Opticks. I was once inclin'd (there being a Woman concern'd in the Discourse) to have address'd it to the Fair ones of that Sex; but when I consider'd, that they themselves make up the glorious number of those Planets that influence and adorn our Globe, and that 'tis the great Business of Mankind to discover their Vortices, I declin'd that thought, and concluded it a Work more proper for Men. I therefore continue my Address to you, wishing you good Success in all Discoveries of this kind, and for my own share, oon∣tent

my self with the op∣portunity of discovering to our little World the Esteem I have for you.
