WHen (Right Honou∣rable) it came to my course to Read in the Middle Temple, after I had there continued a Puisnè full 20 years, and more, (for so they
are called till they Read) and then I was to become an Ap∣prentice of the Common Law, and in my Reading to deliver to my Fellows of that House, such Notes as I had collected in the course of my Study, that I thought to be most profitable to be opened for the exercise and use of Law in our time; And whē I had looked into some o∣ther mens Travels that had Read before me, and other Writers, and found many several Con∣ceipts, and sundry Incertainties touching the Commencement of our Law, and whence it came, and what it was; and I thought it as meet (as Tully
teacheth) that it should be un∣derstood, Quid est de quo disputetur, as to enter into argument of par∣ticular cases which were to be decided thereby: which is the manner of that exercise, well known to your Lordship, as one that entred by that Gate into the happy and honourable Course of life, that God of his great Goodness hath most graciously led you in, from Grace to Grace, and Honor to Honor, to the highest Honor and most ab∣solute Office that is in England under her Majesty, who is im∣mediate in all Dignity, Honor, and Authority under God in this Land. But when I had con∣sidered,
according to my capaci∣ty, of all the Reports that be in print of the practice of the Law, and of some other that I have, I could find no certainty of the Commencement of it, what it was, nor whence it came. For some said, it was the Custom of Normandy that the Conquerour brought in, and placed here; Some, that it came out of Ger∣many, brought by those people that were called Angli, that came hither to inhabit, of whō this Land took the name of Angolia, and the Law the name of Lex Angliae, which savou∣red more of Reason, that is the ground of our Law; And
some imagined one thing, and some another; But that great learned Judge Mr. Littleton, in his first Book satisfied me, that it could neither be the Law of Normandy, nor of any other Country in Germany, nor else∣where, but peculiar to this Land; For he saith, That Tenant by the Courtesy of England is to hold the Land, if his Wife die, during his life, by the Law of England, & is called Tenant by the Courtesy of England, for this, that this is not used in any other Realm, but only in England; whereof I collected, that if the same Law had been in a∣ny other Realm, that Tenure by the Law had likewise been there.

And I found in stories, that presently after the Conquest there were divers Insurrections not only of the people, that did rise without Reason, but of di∣vers of the Nobility of the best sort, who endured Famin, (and that so far as they did ear the vi∣lest vermin) yea, and the utter overthrow of their Houses and Posterity; And all their cause was, but to be restored to their antient Laws & Liberties. And that civil dissention continued long for that cause, and the No∣bility, without restitution of them, would not yield to their Kings, as men that shewed themselves to be made of the
right English mould, ready to endure any pain and loss, rather than the loss of their native Laws & Liberties, and to sub∣ject themselves to the Will-go∣vernment of their new Lords, and new Laws, that the Con∣queror brought in, and the plea∣sures, and oftentimes the dis∣pleasures of their Kings, who did all, and took all, as pleased themselves, under pretence of their Prerogative; which Pre∣rogative rightly used, and truly understood, is a thing most ho∣norable to the Crown, and not prejudicial to the Law, nor hurt∣ful to the Realm, nor any Sub∣jects lawful Interest, or Liberty.

But that Will-government in the Kings, discontentment in the Nobility, & continual Wars within the Realm, continued until K. Henry the 3. who (being by that time by divers descents purged and purified by our Eng∣lish Air, and by Education after the order of our Nation, and so become English, and of a better nature than the Aliens, and their offspring) of love to his subjects, was content to allow English∣men their English Laws; And thereupon, the 10th day of Febr. in the 9th year of his Reign, granted under his great Seal the Great Charter, thereby to restore the Laws of the Land, the Li∣berties
of the Subjects, and to li∣mit his Prerogatives, so, as they should be prejudicial to neither.
But after, kindled (as it seem∣ed) by the heat of his youth, he continued not in that good mind, but infringed the same Charter, and chose his Will for his direction, (as others his late Predecessors had don) and left that Law of the Land, which he had granted to be Restored and Revived. Whereupon 40 years wars after that followed between him and his Barons, (as they be generally Termed, though the greatest Earls, & o∣thers of the chief of the Nobili∣ty, were Partners therin) which
were never fully appeased, until the Parliament was holden at Marlebridge about the 52 year of his Reign, when and where that Charter was enacted in that Parliament, and thereby the an∣tient Laws and Liberties revi∣ved and restored; which Charter so enacted, sithence hath been by all Kings & Queens solemn∣ly sworn at their Coronations to be kept, and so hath been sa∣credly Observed to this day, un∣less some Forgetfulness in some Kings, and Ignorance in some Officers, hath infringed the same. But now, by Gods bles∣sing plentifully powred upon us, it is in sull Use, to the great
Comfort of all good Subjects, and immortal fame of her most Excellent Majesty.
And in the 28 Chapter of that Charter and Act of Parliament, I find it set down in La∣tine, in excellent and significant brief words, to this effect, That no Freeman shall be dealt with either in Life, Liberty, Lands, Liberties, Body or Goods; nor that the King would send for any, nor proceed a∣gainst any, Nisi per legale judi∣ciū parium suorum, aut per le∣gem terrae; And that the King would not defer, deny, nor sell Ju∣stice, or Right to any; which is, as it were, the sum of all the Char∣ter & Act, and the whole mark
that was shot at, to revive the antient Laws, and restore the antient Liberty and Liberties to the Subjects.
Wherein I noted, That, both how far the Prerogative should go, and what is Right and Ju∣stice common to all, is referred to be decided per legem terrae; what therefore that Lex terrae was, which was so carefully sought, & dearly bought with so much Noble blood, which was then thereby revived, I thought if I could find, I had that I sought for.
And therfore I thought it best to begin with such Reporters, or Writers of our Law, as writ
nearest the time of that Char∣ter, and looked into Mr. Bracton, that wrote about 9 H. 3. the very time of the first granting of the Charter, who was one of the chief that were appointed (as it is delivered by Traditiō) to find out again the antient Laws of the Land, when the King was pleased to put thē a∣gain into the force that they had lost by the Conquest. And in his Book in print, I find it thus written, Cum autem ferè in om∣nibus Regionibus utatur legibus, & jure scripto, sola Anglia usa est in su∣is fmibus jure non scripto, & con∣suetudine; in ea quidem ex non scrip∣to, jus venit quod usus comprobavit.
And after that, he saith in the next Chapter these words, Le∣ges Anglicanae fuerunt approbatae consensu utentium, & Sacramento Regum confirmatae. And Cap. 3. Consuetudo more utentium approba∣ta vicem Legis obtinet, & consue∣tudinis non vilis est authoritas.
And he saith further, Lib. 1. Cap. 8. treating of that Law which he calleth the Custom of the Land, Lex autem facit Re∣gem; attribuat igitur Rex Legi, quod Lex attribuit ei, id est, dominatio∣nem & potestatem; nam ubi domi∣natur voluntas, & non Lex, ibi non est Rex. Whereof may be aptly collected, that before this Law was there was no King here in
this Land; for if the Law of the Land made the King, there was none before it; But Kings we find by all Stories to be of a great antiquity here in this Land, and so by consequence the Law must.
And then looking for that matter in the Reports of the Law, I found a Book Case, in 2 H. 4. fol. 18. That it was a∣greed by the Judges, that the Common Custom of the Realm was the Law of the Land; And in that point look∣ing further, I found all Books of Law agree; which Judge∣ment of the Judges from time after the Enacting of that Char∣ter,
and the judgement of Mr. Bracton before at the time of the penning of the Charter, con∣curring in one, satisfied me, That Lex terrae, which is there set down, and thereby revived, and now holden by the great Charter, whereto every King and Queen is sworn at the Co∣ronation, was the antient Cu∣stom of the Land, that all Peo∣ple of several Nations that at se∣veral times inhabited here li∣ked best of, as fittest for this place, whereby the Kings lived in greatest Honor and Ease, and the People in greatest Quietnes and Freedom, wherfore there∣to the Kings were content to
bind themselves, and the Sub∣jects could abide no other. And so I drew that travel to this conclusion, That our Law is the antient Custom of the Country or Land, and of that Antiquity, that there is no Re∣cord nor Matter that can shew the Commencement thereof, nor any man can tell it, but it was before all memory of Man that remaineth in the world, consisting of Maxims, General Grounds, & Rules, received, ap∣proved & allowed as just, good, & necessary for the Governmēt of this Land, begun when this Land first became a Common∣wealth under a King, and ever
sithence used, approved, and al∣lowed, from time to time, time out of mind of Man, and by ex∣perience found in all Ages to be fittest for the place, and to be necessary, honest and profitable both for the Prince and People, and being so found fit and con∣tinued, it became a Custom to be observed of all that should inhabit, or remain here, and when it was lost by the Con∣quest, it was again restored by Common consent of Parlia∣ment, as was necessary it should be; for that the force it had by Custom and Usage was inter∣rupted by the Conquest; So as the Custom of the Realm revi∣ved
by Parliament, is the Law of the Land, which is the Genus to all; And the Parliament and the Acts thereof, and the Prero∣gative of the Prince, and the particular Customs of several Counties, Cities, Boroughs, & Manors, be all but Species of it: For that General Custom of the Realm, which is the Law of the Land, authorizeth the Par∣liament, limiteth the Preroga∣tive, alloweth and disalloweth of Private Customs, and what∣soever in England is to be allow∣ed, and not to be allowed, as they are consonant or dissonant to the reason thereof.
But when I had found out
this by Reading, then looking into the course of Practice, I found the Lord Chancellor fit∣ting highest in Westminster-Hall, and had most to do, & bare the greatest rule; and yet gave his judgement (as it seem'd to me) as it pleased himself, whatsoe∣ver the Law of the Land re∣quired in the case. And seeing Men of great Honor, Learning, & Integrity sit in that place, and so judge. I was in a maze, not finding at the first how it could stand with the Great Charter, that referred all judgement ad Legem terrae, and how any thing different from that Law could be allowable in the Land, sith
the Kings were all sworn to maintain the Charter that resto∣red the Law, and his Lordship and all the Judges were placed by the King.
But when I looked further, and perused it well, I found, that the Custom of the Land, which is that Lex terrae, allowed of that Authority also, as of the rest; and that it was also a Species of that General, the Law of the Land, which was the ant ent Custom of the Realm; And that it was of necessity to be in that sort: For that the Common Law, Custom of the Realm, or Law of the Land, (term it as they list) standing of General
Grounds, Rules, and Maxims, it was impossible but some par∣ticular Cases must fall out, that either the General Rule where∣on it lighteth should be too bard for it, or too short to reach it; And therefore was it of ne∣cessity (to the end that all Cases might be judged according to Right and Equity,) to have one under the Prince, above the rest, to have such an Authority that might judge secundum ae∣quum, & bonum, & sanam consci∣entiam, in these cases, and to mi∣tigate where the Rule of Law would light too hard, and to supply where it came too short, and to the end that he might
have the sending forth of Com∣missions to authorise Judges, & of Precepts from the Prince to produce them to judgment that were to be sued; And to be of e∣special Trust with the King for keeping his Great Seal, & ordering thereof, & in such other things as appertains to that office.
Wherefore entring into consi∣deration thereof, I found that Office also to be limited by the Law, and erected thereby; and therfore I gather'd divers Notes concerning the same, to Answer such Objections as might in that respect be objected against that Charter and Statute, and the Law of the Land; which lying
by me when your Lordship was placed in that great Office, whom, I profess, I ever affected from my first comming to the Temple more thā others (though then I knew, and was known of many of excellent Gifts and Natures;) And after your Honor was called to the Court by her Majesty, I coming sometimes to you from my old good Lord, & dear Friend Sir Edward Saunders, late L. Chief Baron, I found you most gracious and favourable unto me, and now lately recei∣ved such honorable usage from you, as I could not have desired; when some of good and hono∣rable Nature, & excellent good
Disposition dealt hardly with me, (as I thought) not affording me a good word, for a dutiful heart ever born them, and some hard pains performed for thē; (which God, for some offence committed by me, but not a∣gainst them, laid on me,) yet your Lordship, of whom I had never deserved any thing, nor shewed any Duty to, (except God revealed to you the Inten∣tion and Affection of my heart) defended my poor credit (as I heard) to my great Comfort, and spake well of me.
Wherefore to shew my self thankfull, (for an ungratefull Man I have ever hated as a De∣vil,
and loathed as a Monster) I bethought me how to present something to your Honour, as a token of my dutifull mind, & heart tyed to you; But amongst things of price, I could find no∣thing that was not too dear for me to compass, or too mean for you to receive, as a present, and that to deal that way, was but to pour water into the Sea, so plentifully (God be blessed for it) he hath blessed you with a∣bundance; And yet seeing your Honor had so well used me, for nothing, but of your honoura∣ble Nature, I gathered hope, that you would accept some∣thing, (were it never so small)
in good part at my hands, whose heart, and what he hath, is ever at your Commandement; And taking example by the poor Gar∣diners, that present flowers to the greatest Princes, that have no∣thing in them but a small smell, and no profit, & yet are well ac∣cepted of their gracious minds; I thought good to compose my Papers together that concerned the Authority & Exercise of your Lordships Office, and to present them unto you; which, though too simple to inform your Wis∣dom of any understanding, yet at some vacant time may serve to recreate your self in reading; as the plainest things, & not the gra∣vest matters, are meetest for that
purpose. But my good Lord, with these papers I present unto you my self, & my poor service to be altogether at your Comman∣dement, with faithful promise, That if my life may hold one of your fingers frō hurt, I will lay it down to help it, or to do you any good; & while I live will speak well of you to men, as one that deserveth it of all. & pray for you to God, that he may still bless you with increase of his excellent Graces, much Honor, & perfect assurance of everlasting joy; And that her Matie and this Land may long enjoy you, for the mainte∣nance of the Laws and Liberties thereof, and the relief of the op∣pressed Subjects.
