MOst Noble Lord, this Sermon the Spring, preached in the Spring garden of this land, the Princes Court, is offe∣red to your Honourable Ac∣ceptance and Patronage. It is a free-will offering, Ob∣seruance did appoint it, Zeale did kindle it,
Study did enflame it, Pietie did sacrifice it, and now
duetie doth offer it. The aboundant fruitfulnesse of your
Lordshippe doth chal∣lenge this from all other, both for your ablenesse and willingnesse to good workes, wherein you
beatifie your selfe, and beautifie this Land: the Lord reward you according to your harts desire: He that hath them hath blessed your Honour with the Treasures of wisedome and vnderstan∣ding, and hath giuen you the heart of prudence, the
eye of prouidence, the eare of iustice, the heart of Religion, and the spirite of deuotion, and hath made your Honour a most speciall nur∣sing father of his two deare Daughters, this
Church and common wealth. Ride on with your Honour, because of the worde of truth, of meekenesse and
righteousnesse, and the Lord shall bee with you, and shall blesse you with the Grace of Glory here and the glory of Grace hence. And so in all obseruance I rest,
