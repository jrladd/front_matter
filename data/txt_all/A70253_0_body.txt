My Lord,
WHen I had the honour last to wait upon your Lorship in your own Palace at Lincoln, you was pleased to signifie such an approbation of this Discourse, as to command from me a Copy of it, which when understood by some other Persons of no small acount, I was vigorously press'd by them to make it Publick, they hoping thereby some
good might accrew to that Church, in the Go∣vernment of which your Lordship bears so considerable a share to so good purposes: And being not willing to shun any opportunity whereby I might serve the Publick, obey your Lordship, and give contentment to my Friends, I buckled my self presently to a tran∣scribing of it in order to the Press.
And now, such as it is, I present to your Lordship, desiring that as it derived the bold∣ness of appearing abroad from your Lordships good liking of it, so it may receive Protection from your Lordships Power and Authority. For Discourses of this nature, if they be not well fortified, your Lordship knows are quick∣ly blasted by soul Reproaches, and unworthy Reflections either upon the Authors or the Principles; and what men want in Argu∣ment and Proof, they usually make up in Slan∣der and unjust Imputations. And truly, had I not had a greater value for Truth, for the
Peace and Settlement of the Kingdom, for the prosperous and quiet Reign of our Great Master the King, then I have for mine own Esteem and Reputation, among some sorts of people, I would never have made my first Essay in Publick of so ungrateful a nature, as I know this must needs be to many men.
But we are to consider we were not born for our selves, and so that the Cause of God may be carried on, the Interest of the Protestant Re∣ligion maintained. I think every man ought to make a venture of all that is near and dear to him, and think himself very happy, if, with the loss of all, he can be serviceable to so great and good Purposes: A thing which we whose years have not been multiplied to the number of your Lordships, have very great encourage∣ment to do, both from your Lordships Exam∣ple, and many other worthy Persons in the late bad Times, who, to defend the Principles stated and recommended in this Discourse,
suffered you Selves to be stript of all those ex∣ternal Comforts which Philosophers tell us have a very great share, in contributing to our happiness while we are here. But now as God hath been pleased to restore the Church to its ancient Constitution, and your Lordship, and many other eminent Sufferers, not onely to its Wealth and Revenue, but its Defence and Support; so I pray God it may continue with the advantage of such Lights as long as the Sun and Moon endure. For 'tis plain, take away the Church, and destroy the Princi∣ples by which it is setled, and we introduce all disorder and confusion into the World imme∣diately, and every man turns Reformer, and every week presents us with a new Model, vainly boasting it self fetched out of the Old Gospel, which of how dismal consequence to Religion, and to civil Societies, is no difficult thing to judge.

But that such a Desolation may never over∣take the Church again, thanks be to God, hath been the care of this present Parliament, in several Acts framed on purpose; is the endea∣vour and care of your Lordship, and several others of great worth and moment, and shall, I assure you, be the daily Prayer (as indeed it ought to be of every good man) of him,

Westham, Aug. 7.
