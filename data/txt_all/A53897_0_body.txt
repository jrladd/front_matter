My Lord,
I Have been lately honoured by your Lord∣ship
with a double command, one to preach,
the other to publish, this Sermon: of the
first of which though I might have been
innocently ambitious, yet of the second I may be just∣ly
asham'd: partly, because the Sermon it self is
much unworthy of publique view, especially upon an
occasion of so great remark; partly, and more con∣cerningly,
in regard that having been so many years
happy in the knowledge of your Lordship, and as long
obliged as known unto your Honour, I have not hi∣therto
appear'd with any thing worthy of your Lord∣ship's
Patronage. I shall therefore humbly crave the
leave of making to my self this interpretation, that
your Honour did intend this Command as a remem∣brance
of my duty, that I may hereafter meditate
something to demonstrate to whom I owe the en∣couragement
of my studies. In the interim by this
present Discourse I shall only give a testimony, how

properly I have endeavoured the memory of your Fa∣ther,
by obscuring his virtues, and your concernments,
in my expressions, from all persons who are strangers
to your Family, while I speak to them which were
known unto you both, as to such as cannot but be
most sensible, and bear a perpetual remembrance,
of them. Howsoever what is wanting in this Fune∣ral
Sermon, shall be supplyed in my perpetual devo∣tion,
praying for an everlasting succession of 
Benedictions upon your Honour, your Honourable
and most Virtuous Lady, and your most hopeful issue,
as becometh
