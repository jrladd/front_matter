SIR,
TO forget to divulge your noble Favours to me, in any of my Works, were to mur∣ther GRATITVDE; Which I will

never be guilty of: And though I am your Slave, being manacl'd with Chaines of Obligation, yet my Chaines feele softer then Silke, and my Bondage is plea∣santer then Freedome; because I am bound to your selfe, who are a Person so full of Generosity, as you delight in Bounty, and take pleasure to relieve the necessita∣ted Condition of your Friends; and what is freely given, is com∣fortably receiv'd, and a satisfa∣ction to the minde. For, should a bountifull hand be joyn'd to Re∣pining Thoughts, it would be like a Gilded Statue made of rotten wood. But your minde is the Mint of Virtues, which makes

them currant Coyne; which I will never clip with a silent Tongue, nor change with an un∣thankfull Heart; but locke it up with the Key of Admiration, in the Chest of Affection. I shall not feare to be turn'd out of your Favour, though my deserts make me not worthy to dwell therein; because you are so constant to Cha∣rity, and so compassionate to Mi∣sery; so adverse to Covetous∣nesse, so arm'd against Mis-for∣tunes, so valiant in Friendship, so victorious in Naturall Affecti∣ons, as you are the Conquerour of all Merit. And may you ride in Triumph on Fame round the

Vniverse, untill the expiring thereof.
Thus doth your hum∣ble Servant joy in your Love, proud of your Favour, Glorie in your Fame, and will die in your Service.
