GREAT SIR,
AS Your Majesties Gracious Incourage∣ment gave the first Life and Being to this Work, so it naturally in all humble Duty addresses it self, for Protection under the Wing of Your Favour and Royal Mercy, which Your Majesty so justly challenges, as a Virtue more peculiarly Eminent and Conspicuous in your whole Life, then in any of Your Illustrious Predecessors: It is Necessity and not Presumption, which obliges the Author to Prostrate himself and this Book at Your Royal Feet; For though the whole World can shew nothing so Harmless and Innocent as Truth, yet is she not able to defend her self from her constant Enemies, Malice, Error, and ill Designs; nor knows she whi∣ther to flie for a secure Refuge, but to the Sanctuary, of the Great Defender of the Faith; to which the near∣ness of her Relation, raises in her a comfortable hope that she shall participate of the same Royal Protection.

There are some Persons whose Interest it is to lie behind the Curtain even in the present Age, and who therefore cannot with patience bear the drawing of it, so as to let in the light into that which is past; lest by comparing former Occurrences, the Temper, Incli∣nations, Principles and Movements of those Times, there should be discovered so near a Resemblance be∣tween the Lineaments and Proportions of the past and present, as to be too convincing that there is no greater difference then between the elder and the younger Bro∣ther of the same Parents, Rebellion and the Good Old Cause. Nor is it strange to see some sort of Peo∣ple very angry with the hand, which presents them with a Glass wherein they may see the Exact and true Image of Rebellion and Sedition, when they can no sooner look into it but they find their own Fa∣ces there. But it would be not only a Wonder, but a Miracle, if they should not shew their Resentments against both the Workman and his Work, and by in∣deavouring to hurt his, to secure their own Reputa∣tion.
But Your Majesties Grace and Favour is such an Amulet against the Poyson of the most Malignant Fa∣ction, as is able to secure the happy Persons upon whom it is bestowed, from the Infection of the most Malicious Breath, and Venemous Tongues; and in the Hopes of this, the Author does with all humility present Your Majesty with the first opening of the Scene of that Deplorable Tragedy wherein Your Glo∣rious Father had so large a share of Suffering; there Your Majesty may see the several Steps and Progres∣sive Advances which those Artists in Rebellion and Usurpation, made towards the accomplishment of their Great Design of overthrowing the best Monarchy, and
Extirpating the most Apostolical Church in the whole World. Here may Your Majesty take a view, of the most supple Flattery, and deep Hypocrisy of a Confede∣rated Faction, and how Rebellion, to make the Peo∣ple in Love with her, was represented to them in the Masquerading Habit and Accoutrements of Religion and Reformation; how Slavery and Tyranny, those two dreadful Monsters, walk'd in the borrowed Equi∣page of the Liberty of the Subject, and the Funda∣mental Laws, and Birthrights of the People; and how under the Mantle of Redressing Grievances, the Na∣tion came to labour under the greatest Grievance, that ever the Necks of the Generous English Submitted to, even the Mischief which they pretended to fear, abso∣lute Tyranny, and the most Arbitrary Government of an Ʋsurping Faction.
Here Your Majesty may see the true Picture of the Men of those Principles and Times, drawn from the Life by their own hands, and in their proper and natural Colours; and not only their outward Air, Mine and Garb, but the Picture of their very Souls, their Thoughts, Aims, Contrivances, and most Se∣cret Designs, and the black Conclusion, at which all these were levell'd, over which they so Industriously drew the fair Vails and Curtains, of Sanctimony and pretended Loyalty, seeming Humility, and counterfeit Allegiance: Your Majesty may be conducted into those Mines of Sedition, unreasonable Fears, groundless and unsatisfiable Jealousies, of the Dangers of Pope∣ry and Arbitrary Government, the very Powder which blew up the Foundations both of Church and State; Your Majesty may see their Principal Engines of Battery, amongst which, the Liberty of the Press, and, I Blush to name it, the Licentious abuse of the
Pulpit, were not the least, or did the most Inconsidera∣ble Execution towards the Ruin of the Government.
I shall not presume to say more, but humbly Prostrate my self at Your Majesties Feet, to beg the Liberty to add my most fervent Prayers and Wishes, to my Sin∣cere indeavours of Serving Your Majesty with my utmost Power: May there be an Emulous Strife be∣tween the Number, and the Glory, of Your Majesties Years: May the constant Care of Heaven, and the Watchful attendance of its Glorious Militia, still Guard Your beloved Life, against all the Wicked at∣tempts, of the Enemies of Your Person and Govern∣ment: May every day that is added to Your Sacred Life, contribute fresh Accessions of Happiness and Pro∣sperity, Peace and Tranquility to Your Auspicious Reign; May You Triumph in the Hearts and Affe∣ctions of Your People, and over the Heads of Your defeated Enemies: And could my Prayers, Wishes or Indeavours prove as Successful as they are Sincere, Your Majesty should not have one Subject in all Your Dominions, less Zealous of Your Majesties Service, sensible of their Duty and Interest, or studious of Ex∣pressing their humble Loyalty, then the Person who has placed all his Ambition and Glory, in Indavour∣ing to approve himself,
