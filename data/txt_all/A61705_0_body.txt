May it please Your Grace,
HOW soon I entertained any thoughts Publishing a Discourse of this Natur in Vindication of our Church and Cle gy, I was easily determined to send abroad under Your Lordships Protection. You ha been such an Eminent Sufferer and Confessor

those woful Calamities of our Church and Nation, have been Persecuted to such a height, both in Per∣son and Reputation; meerly for the Defence of our common Principles, that you may justly challenge the Patronage of such a Treatise as your due.
Your Merit having justly Advanced you to such a Dignity in the Church, as to be a Father of the Clergy; I therefore presume you will not decline to Espouse any thing that is Writ in a just Defence of their Innocency. The most of those Persons, whose Vindication I have here undertaken, have sometimes lived in Your Graces Diocese, are perso∣nally known to you, and you have had frequent oc∣casions to search into the whole course of their Life and Conversation, so that I dare the more boldly Appeal to your Lordships Impartial Judgment, if what I have said here in their Vindication be any more than is Just and Reasonable; and what the severest Judge will readily acknowledge to be their due.
While the Enemies of the Church are at Work to Calumniate and Accuse the Clergy; your Grace being placed in such an Eminent Station, could not well expect to escape the Censure of their Ma∣lice. The Office you bear in the Church, and the Sacred Character you have stamped upon you, ex∣pose

you more Remarkably to the Malice of such Vermin as despise Religion▪ and trample upon all that's Sacred. But your Lordships Character and Merit is so Universally known, that what∣ever Malicious Reports are Raised upon you by the Enemies of our Church and Religion, deserve no a particular Confutation.
However, your Grace has been pleased to gr∣tisie your Enemies so far, as to take some Notice of their Calumnies and has Annexed to this Trea∣tise such an irreragable Assertion of your own In∣nocency, as cannot fail henceforward to sop the Mouths of your most inverterate Enemies.
My Lord, I don't question but you are alway ready under your Troubles, to practise that Chri∣stian Doctrine of Patience, you have so often Re∣commended to others, and I hope God, in his own good time, will pu an end to these Nationa Judgments, and recal your Lordship srom you Exile, to be again an Ornament to our Church, and to assist in the Rebuilding of the Second Tem∣ple, and making it more Glorious and Beautisul than the former; that to the Excellent Constitu∣tion of our Church-Discipline, we may have added a set Form of Prayer and Devotion, and then our Church shall again Flourish as a Palm-Tree, and

forever after be immoveable as a Rock. So beg∣ging your Lordships Paternal Benediction, I am with all Duty,
MY LORD,
