MY LORD,
THo' Your Quality and the Awfulness of your High Station, might very well prevent the Ambition of an Author from making Addresses

of this nature, to your Lord∣ship, yet I confess my self less discouraged by the grandeur of your Titles, than I am by that of your Wit; 'tis that alone that brings me trembling to your Feet with this little Tribute of my Duty. Methought when all the honest part of the World was full of your Praise, when all that profess Loyalty were Celebrating your never dying Name, I shou'd have lookt up∣on my self as unworthy of the Honour I now aspire to, if I amongst the number, shou'd not with all imaginable grati∣tude pay my acknowledgments for the good you have rendred the publick, as well as for the Services you have rendred the Crown; which you have

more effectually done, with more noble Bravery, Fortitude and Resignation, than any o∣ther great States-man; you have so absolutely attach'd your self to the interest of your Monarch, that 'tis evident you are as intirely his own, as if after him you had no more business with the World, or even Life it self; and to this Glory you have arriv'd by such difficulties as no other Parts, Wit, or Courage could have conquer'd, and by it have carried your great Fame even above Envy.
Nor can the unthinking and most malicious of your Enemies reproach your Lordship with self-interest in any of your Servi∣ces, since all the World knows, when they were thought Cri∣minal,

nay even Punishable, (for such miserable times we have seen) when 'twas enough to have forfeited your Fortune, and almost your Life, then, I say, there was found in your Lordship, that undaunted Bravery, that Spirit and fire of Loyalty, that true concern for the Royal Cause, that you were the first destin'd Victim for the slaughter, the first to be Sa∣crific'd to the Association Rage, even when you had nothing left you but Honour, Justice and Innocence for your Guard. And as it may be truly affirm'd that the greatness of your Re∣solution gave the most consi∣derable assistance to the turn of those Rabble-ruling times, and the reestablishing them in their

right and regular motion, it must be also confess'd that the same unchangeable resolution has continued them still (under God and our Gracious Sove∣reign) in the same tranquillity we now behold them; and we, who have reap'd the advan∣tages of so good a conduct, have now no more to do but to express our sense of it in our several degrees; the People by their Prayers, and the Poets by their Panegyricks. Such I would gladly offer in Im∣mortal Songs; but oh! the Mu∣ses have all taken Wing, and are fled to Climates more en∣couraging and kind, and have scarcely left behind them one Son inspir'd; so that instead of Nobler numbers, they are ne∣cessitated

servilely to creep after the sence of foreign Authors, stinting the Generous fancy to anothers thought.
Of this nature, my Lord, is this small Piece which I most hum∣bly Dedicate to your Lordship. 'Tis a Discourse of Religion, in a time when we have scarce a∣ny other Theme; 'tis grown so general a Mode, that even the Sword-men are now fiercer dis∣putants than heretofore the la∣zier Gown-men were, while every Spark of noise enough, (sometimes the best of the Ar∣gument) shews his Wit and Learning on that subject. But since the stream runs that way, I believ'd it as ridiculous to ap∣pear in good company drest like Mrs. Abigail, as (at this

time) not to be arguing some points of Religion, tho never so Mal à propo. But least, by such an undertaking I should, as ma∣ny do, but the more embarass the Mystries of it, we shall treat here only of the Pagan Religion, and of the abominable Cheats of the Oracles and their Priests.
My Author, who is of the French Nation, has here giv∣en us a collection of many diverting and useful remarks on the Ancient Religion of the Pagans, and a very good account of those Oracles that once made so great a noise in the World; and which, I believe, will not be unpleasant to the Readers. But if in the result, it have but the Honour of being approv'd by your Lordship I shall, be very

happy in the occasion it gives me of begging leave to sub∣scribe my self,
My Lord,
