My good Lord.
TO be Honoured for old Nobility,
or Hereditary Titles is not alone
proper to your Selfe, but to some
few of your rancke, who may chal∣lenge
the like priuiledge with you:
but in our age to vouchsafe (as you
haue often done) a ready hand to rayse the
deiected spirits of the contemned Sonnes of
the Muses, Such as would not suffer the glo∣rious
fire of Poesie to be wholly extingui∣shed,
is so remarkable, and peculiar o your
Lordship, that with a full 
it is acknowledged that the 
Protection of the Dramatique , is
yours, and almost without 
payre not therefore, but 
to present my 
your clemency 
pretation. 

Your gracious acceptance of this trifle, in
which if I were not confident there are
some peeces worthy the perusall, it should
haue beene taught an humbler flight, and
the writer (Your Countrey-man) neuer
yet made happy in your notice, and fauour,
had not made this an aduocate to plead for
his admission among such as are wholy,
and sincerely deuoted to your seruice. I may
liue to tender my humble thankefulnesse in
some higher strayne, and till then comfort
my selfe with hope, that you descend from
your height to receiue.
