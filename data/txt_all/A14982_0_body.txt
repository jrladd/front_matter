HOPEFVLL PRINCE,
NONE so fit to Patronize workes orday∣ned to extirpate Vice & esta∣blish Vertue as Cōmanders: & amongst them, none more
 then Princes. For if we consi∣der what giueth most dignity to the person of a Prince, or affoardeth him best meanes for his authority to rule, Ver∣tue will appeare the most emi∣nent; as well to grace the one, as to maintayne the other.
Aristotle the Prince of Phi∣losophers,Arist. l. 1. magnor. Moral. cap. 4. & 6. speaking of the ex∣cellency of Vertue, and com∣paring it with Principality, giueth to Vertue the higher place, as a special inward good of the soule; & putteth Lear∣ning, Principality, and the like, among the outward gifts of Fortune.
My purpose therfore, being
 in these Treatises to establish decēt Modesty against vanity of Apparell; Temperance a∣gainst excesse of Drinking; & Religion against Impiety in swearing; & that Vertue esta∣blisheth Ciuill gouernmēt: I haue presumed to adresse thē to your Highnesse, who one day (as we hope) is to succeed in Regall Authority; because (in some part) they may serue you, as necessary furni∣ture of Christian policy. And if Fauour might grant me op∣portunity to speake of these subiects in your Presence: I should in plainer termes de∣clare, what is the originall
 cause of these Abuses which I reproue, and how the perfect redresse of them, dependeth on the exact reformation of the roote, out of which they growe.
My Wish then (Noble Prince) is, that this may be gratefully accepted: & stand your Highnes in some steed, (when time shall come) for the gouernment of your peo∣ple; remayning euer your HIGHNES
