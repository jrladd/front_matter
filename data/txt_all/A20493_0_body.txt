SIR,
THere bee two things necessarie for
this life, Foode and Raiment. For
Rayment you have much travailed to
the publike good, by adding to our Olde
Draperies, the making of Perpetuanaes, Spa∣nish
Cloathes, &c. And lastly, by bringing
Rape Oyle to the use of Cloathing: where∣by
you have exceedingly well deserved of
the Common-wealth. For Food, that other
and greater necessary, The Newe Invention
for Fertiling and Inriching of Areable Grounds,
the Argument of the ensuing Treatise, must
acknowledge you as the first Author; So to
have beene by your selfe, and others by you
directed, the prime Experimentors of the cer∣taintie
and realitie thereof: Then which, I

scarsely know, whether any thing hath bene
Invented of more great and generall use. Yet
have you not so busied your selfe about many
things with Martha, as to neglect that one
necessary of necessaries, Maries good part,
which hath the blessing of both lives: which
your often praying, frequent hearing, much
reading, and meditating of the best things,
well testifie: But hereof enough. This Booke
of Direction, being your owne, and for the
maine, framed out of your tryed directi∣ons,
desires to passe into the world un∣derthe
protection of your credit, and name:
Vntill by approved experience it shall have
gained credit unto it selfe, and returned credit
unto you; meane while, it shall rest conten∣ted
with that olde Motto:
Trie, and Trust.
