GEntlemen, the Horse when hee is first handed to the warres, starteth at the cracke of euery peece; and e∣uery coucht Launce is a censure of death to a fresh water Souldier: So fareth it with mee, for neuer before being in print I start at the sight of the Presse, and ha∣uing not dared to looke into the open light, I feared with the Owle to fly before it be twylight: yet I haue heard others whose bookes haue past your view, ac∣count you so fauorable, curteous and affable, shrou∣ding euery scape with silence; that I presumed the rather to experience with them the hope of your fa∣uours: which if I finde as they haue done, though I bee blinde Bayard, yet I will in the thickest of the mire plunge vp to the Saddle for your sakes. Virgill afore he wrote his Aeneidos, wrote his Culex; and as∣saide in trifles, afore he attempted in Triumphs. Lu∣can wrote Quaedam Lirica, before he began with Bel∣lumper Emathios plusquam Ciuilia campos. Roome was not builded on a day, and men that venter little, ha∣zard little: So gentlemen, I present you with a toy of Tarltons, called his newes out of Purgatory; which I

desire you accept as curteously as I offer willing to to please: Though they be Crepundia yet reade them, and if you find any pleasant Facetia, or Quicquid Salis▪ thinke all sauory, and so pleasde without being satiri∣cally peremptory: for Momus will haue a mouth full of inuectiues, and Zoilus should not be Zoilus if hee were not squint eide. Therefore leauing their hu∣mours to the wordmongers of mallice that like the Vipers grew odious to their owne kinde, hoping of your curteous censure, I bid you farewell.
