MADAM,
WHen I have thrown my self at your
Ladiships feet, with the humblest
Reverences I can be capable of, I
must confess I cannot be excused
from the greatest Presumption I
am able to make. For to acknowledge that the
meanest person in the world hath assumed the
boldness to offer this Piece to one of the most
illustrious Ladies of this Island, is so small an
argument for my Pardon, that I must, not with∣out
much regret, profess my self to be in the
highest degree unfortunate, in having no nobler
a Sacrifice to offer at the Shrine of so much Ho∣nor
and Vertue.

They are strangers to England, Madam, that
are ignorant of your Excellencies; and yet all
those Attraits, all those Graces, all that Majesty
which you carry about you, and like the Sun
in its sphere, incessantly disperse, are far short of
those Endowments which the fairer guest, your
Soul, is possess'd of. Your strange Vivacity and
Recollection, excellent Prudence, severe and ge∣nerous
Chastity, and your great and exemplary
Affection to your Noble Lord, hath rendred you
in the opinion of all the interessed in Vertue, as
one much above your years, and perfected in
the highest Practises and Experiences to Con∣summation;
Nature▪ who accomplishes others
by degrees, having finished you in a manner in
an instant, and from your Childhood brought
you to that perfection, as if she intended to en∣dow
you, with what others acquire, and lift you
up to your Meridian, assoon as you were come
above your Horizon.
But, Madam, I fear I make an assault upon
your Vertue, and confess these declarations un∣necessary
to a Soul so fully comprehensive as
yours is, and must be. It might have been e∣nough
if I had only said you are derived from
the Royal and heroick Families of SEYMOVR
and DEVEREVX, and that you are the true
Pattern of that great & good Lady Marchioness
of Hartford, your mother, whose noble example
is all you can find in books. For this expression

of Charite's Beauty, 'tis but your Ladiships in
reverse; and those vain and idle Adorations
which Lysis payes her, are but such as are really
due from all Mankind to You.
But, Madam, as I ought to be modest in my
Authors behalf, who was esteem'd one of the
most refin'd Wits of France; so I beseech you
recollect in that great and piercing Mind of
yours, that, as excellent pieces of Painting have
been done from the ugliest Faces, and have had
their places in the Cabinets of Princes, so I have
been bold to present this (which is a Picture of
one of the greatest and most pleasant Extrava∣gances)
to your Ladiship; and if my endea∣vours
have done my Author his right, I hope
they may find the same reception from your
Ladiship in English, as the Authors did in his
language; which is the passionate desire of
MADAM,
