My Lord,
AFter five years residence at Constantino∣ple, in service of the Embassy of the Earl of Winchilsea (my ever honoured Lord) and this my second journey from thence by land into my own Country, I judged it a point of my Duty, and of my Religion too, to de∣dicate this following Treatise, as the fruits of my Travels, Negotiations, and leisure in those remote parts, to the Noble Person of your Lordship; as that Votiva Tabula, which many both in ancient and in the modern times, after some signal deliverance, or hap∣py arrival at their desired Port, use to offer to their Gods, their Saints, or their Patrons: And truly, my Lord, this Discourse treating chiefly of the Turkish Policy, Government, and Max∣ims of State, seems naturally to appertain to the Patronage of your Lordship, whose faculties of Wisdom and Vertue have given you the Blessing of your Princes Favour, and the Repu∣tation, as well abroad as at home, of an Eminent and Dexte∣rous Minister of State.
It were a great Presumption in me to offer any Observati∣ons of my own in the Courts of Christian Princes to the test of your Lordships Experience and Judgment, who not only is ac∣quainted with the Customs and Manners, but penetrates into the Designs, and knows the Cabinet Councels of Neighbouring Principalities, with whom our divided world may possibly be concerned; but perhaps without disparagement to your Lord∣ships profound Wisdom, or over-value of my own abilities, I may confidently draw a rude Scheme before your Lordship, of the Turkish Government, Policies, and Customs; a Subject which Travellers have rather represented to their Country∣men, to supply them with discourse and admiration, than as a matter worthythe consideration, or concernment of our Kings or our Governors.
It hath been the happy fortune of the Turk to be ac∣counted barbarous and ignorant; for upon this perswasion Christian Princes have laid themselves open and unguarded to their greatest danger; contending together for one Palm of land, whilst this puissant Enemy hath made himself master of whole Provinces, and largely shared in the rich and plea∣sant possessions of Europe.
This contempt of the Turk on one side, caused the Em∣perour to be so backward in opposing that torrent of the Ot∣toman Force, which in the first year of the late War broke in upon him; and the suspition of designs from France on the other, altered the Resolutions and Councels of the Empe∣rour for prosecution of the War, which then running favou∣rably on the Christian part, was no less than with the asto∣nishment of the whole world, and of the Turks themselves, on a sudden understood to be clapt up with Articles of a disadvantageous Peace; admiring to see the Emperour give a stop to the current of his Victories, and relinquish the Game with a lucky hand. But this will seem no riddle to those who penetrate Affairs with the same judgment that your Lordship doth, and consider the unfirm condition the House of Austria was in, by a daily expectation of the death or fall of so main a Basis of it, as the King of Spain, and the division amongst the Princes of the Empire, the League of the Rhine, the French practices to make the Duke of Enguyen King of Poland, and the extravagant demands of the French and Rhi∣nish League for Winter quarters, and places of strength, not only in Hungary, but also in Styria and the adjacent places; and at the same time look on the Factions in Hungary, and a considerable Army of French in the bowels of Germany, who were supposed in those parts to have rather come with design to over-awe the next Diet, and force the German Prin∣ces to elect the French King for King of the Romans, than with sincere and simple intentions of opposing themselves to the Enemy of the Faith: for then it will appear, that the best use the Emperor could make of his good success, was moderation in Victory, and reconciliation with his powerful Enemy. And hereupon Earl Leisle being dispatched for Ex∣traordinary Embassador from his Imperial Majesty, to the Grand Signior; though the Turk was elevated with the thoughts of the necessity the Christians had of a Peace, did

yet so happily manage his Charge and Employment, as crea∣ted in the Turks an extraordinary reverence towards his Per∣son, and obtained such Honours and Treatments from them, as the Turkish Court never bestowed before on the Empe∣rors, or any other Christian Embassador; extorting this Complement from the great Vizier, That he was more satis∣fied the Emperor had sent so brave and illustrious a person, than if he had sought to reconcile his Affections with a hun∣dred thousand Dollars more of Present. And to do justice to this worthy Person, he hath brought a reputation to the British Nation, above any in our age, whose vertues and industry have acquired the highest Trusts and Preferments in Forreign Parts; and done the same honour to his King, under whom he was born a Subject, as to the present Empe∣ror and his Ancestors, under whom he is, and hath alwaies been a faithful Minister: having deserved so eminently for saving the whole German Empire from the Treason of Wal∣lestein, by his own single act of bravery (a story notoriously known to all the world) as can never in gratitude be forgot by that Nation, nor want its due Record and place in the History of that Country.
The speculation of what is contained in this following Discourse may seem unworthy of your Lordships precious hours, in regard of that notion of Barbarity with which this Empire is stiled; yet the knowledge hereof will be like a Turquoise, or some other Jewel set within the Rose of those many Gems of your Lordships Wisdom and Vertues.
This Present, which I thus humbly consecrate to your Lordship, may be termed barbarous, as all things are, which are differenced from us by diversity of Manners and Cu∣stom, and are not dressed in e mode and fashion of our times and Countries; for we contract prejudice from igno∣rance and want of familiarity. But your Lordship, who exactly ponderates the weight of humane Actions, acknow∣ledges reason in all its habits, and draws not the measures of Oeconomy or Policy from external appearances or effects, but from the fundamental and original Constitutions; so that your Lordship will conclude, that a People, as the Turks are, men of the same composition with us, cannot be so savage and rude as they are generally described; for igno∣rance and grossness is the effect of Poverty, not incident to

happy men, whose spirits are elevated with Spoils and Tro∣phies of so many Nations.
Knowing (My Lord) that this work which I have underta∣ken is liable to common censure, I have chosen to shrowd my name under the patronage of your Lordship, to protect me from the ill-understanding and mis-conceptions of our Coun∣trymen, both at home and abroad: against which I doubt not but to be sufficiently armed in all parts where I travel, when the countenance your Lordship affords me, is joined to the authority of his Excellency the Earl of Winchilsea, his Maje∣sties Embassador Extraordinary, now actually resident at Con∣stantinople, my ever honoured Lord; to whom I read, a long time before publish'd to the World, the greatest part of this following Treatise; and as I received his favourable approba∣tion, and assent to the verity of most matters herein contain∣ed; so I must ingenuously confess to have been beholding to that quick and refined Genius of his, who often rectified my mistakes, supplyed me with matter, and remembred me of ma∣ny material points, which I might otherwise have most unad∣visedly omitted: And his Excellency knowing that in his ab∣sence this Book might want a favourable Patron, left me to my self to seek out one, who might concur with him in the same innocent defence. And as (My Lord) you are a publick person, and under our Gracious Sovereign, are one of those generous spirits which have espoused the common interest of the Nation; so I presume on this present occasion not to want your protection also in a single capacity: for which excess of favours I shall ever pray for the exaltation of the greater glory of your Lordship, and for ever acknowledge my self,
My Lord,
