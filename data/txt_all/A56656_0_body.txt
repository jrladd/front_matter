Sir,
I Know that I shall but revive your grief by sending this Sermon to your hands; but it is a trouble which you have drawn upon your self, by desiring to see that which you heard. It was not meet that I should resist your re∣quest, because he whom I had reason to love as my self, used to deny you nothing; yet if I had obtained leisure to have considered these things over again more deep∣ly, you might have seen them (it is possible) pressed with more weight of argument, and put into a more exact order: But since you were desirous that I would dispatch them to the Press speedily, these Pa∣pers come to you to entreat you, that you will be con∣tent to bear a share in the faults that by reason of haste may (it is likely) be discerned in them. And if I could requite you in a greater matter, by alleviating your griefs, and helping you to bear your sorrows, I
should readily lend you my hands, yea & my shoulders. But thanks be to God you need not my assistance, but have learnt to bear patiently this sad providence. It is an easie matter to be pleased with Gods providences when he doth what we would have him, but to rejoyce in adverse things, and to suck some sweetness out of gall and wormwood, is very hard. Every body can thresh corn out of full sheaves, and fetch water out of the Thames; but to bring an harvest out of the dry stubble, and to draw water out of a rock, is the work only of a divine power which can bring good out of evil. I need not doubt but you are indued with it, and that God will comfort you with the same comforts wherewith you comfort others, and that you will say Even this is good too. Let me have a share in your prayers that it may be sanctified to me also, who ought to think my self concerned in it, and I shall ever remain
