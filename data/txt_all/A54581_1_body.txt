MY LORD,
I Having in p. 57, 58, 59. of the following Second Part occasionally dilated on the Common Place or Notion of Heaven having so often made so much use of the weight of one man in the balance of Government, I esteem'd my dedicating this Part of my Work to your Lordship but common Iustice to your Character, who have been the happy Instrument of God and the King in making so many Englishmen happy.
My Lord, It is but natural when the Just are in Authority, for the People to rejoice (as Solomon tells us) and for them like∣wise to anticipate the Honours of the Prince's affording to a Person heroically just, by wishing them. And this is most properly applicable to your Lordship; and that in your Case may be said what Pliny in his Panegyric mentions of Nerva's adopting Trajan, That it was impossible it should have pleas'd all when it was done, except it had pleas'd all before it was done.
My Lord, It was Nature that prompted them to presage with Pleasure the Profit that would come to them from the accessions of Honour to you, and whereby they knew that the height of your Power would be naturally productive of Blessings to them as the height of Hills and Mountains is of Springs for the benefit of the lower Earth, and of those who inhabit it, and which are found wanting in Countrys where there are no Hills. And the Ancient placing of the Statues of Magistrates by Fountains, may be supposed to have been an indication of the Peoples valuing them as the Causers of what did console and refresh them.
My Lord, when I consider how much your Lordship and other just Persons of the Roman-Catholick Communion have in the per∣formance of the moral Offices of Natural Obedience to your Prince obliged so many of his Subjects by your being helpful to them a∣gainst Oppressions in their Estates and Consciences, I hope I shall not appear too sanguine in my Conjecture of any ferment soon na∣turally ceasing about the exercise of the Dispensative Power being a gravamen to Property.
My Lord, I shall in the former of the two remaining Parts of this my Work (and which are both ready for the Press) entertain your Lordship with such a farther Assertion of those offices of that

Obedience call'd Natural, as I believe will give no offence to any Zealot, or Patriot, and as I have hitherto took care to give none to either: For tho I think it not deniable that our Princes may by their Laws limit the exercise of that Allegiance or Obe∣dience, with respect to Circumstances, yet as no Humane Laws can legitimate the entire withdrawing of any part of the Obedience enjoin'd by the Divine Law natural or positive, so how our Lex rrae hath not limited the exercise of the Regal Power from the Dispensing with Disability, as in the Case now so much agitated, I have shewn, and shall further. But I conceive it here necessary for me to acquaint your Lordship that I have been often put to it as speaking cum vulgo & grosso modo, and for brevity's sake to use the aforesaid Expression of Dispensing with Disability, and with Disability incurr'd by Act of Parliament, that is, with what is generally enacted to be incurr'd, and SEEMS to be alike in∣curr'd by all Persons who perform not what the Act enjoins; and which Dispensing with Disability is frequently used in popular dis∣course for the pardoning it, and for the liberatio à poenâ, and as the Lord Chief Iustice Vaughan's Report by me so much cited men∣tions dispensing to have been defined by some of the Iudges. But to a judgment so vastly comprehensive and profoundly penetrating as your Lordships, the dispensing with Disability must easily appear to be properly meant of the preventing it, and the dispensing with what might Cause it (according to the style of Queen Eliza∣beth's Letters Patents) or effect the actual incurring of what will reverâ be incurr'd by the Persons not exempted by Dispen∣sation from the doing what the Law enjoins: and which will be made to appear obvious to every man's understanding in one of the following Parts, and wherein I shall have occasion to speak less cum vulgo and more closely and accurately of the Nature of Dis∣pensing, and of its effects in either forum, then yet I have had.
And now having Named that Great Queen, I shall not doubt but since the Members of the Church of England do now under our most puissant and most just Monarch find themselves as secure in the Profession of the Religion by Law establish'd as they did in her great and glorious Reign, it will upon recollection of thought appear as natural to them to hold themselves obliged to shew the same tenderness for every branch of Prerogative, and particularly for that of the Dispensative Power, that was then so remarkable in Par∣liament, and throughout the Realm.
My Lord,
