Gentlemen,
However favourable a Reception this Discourse might meet with, at the time and place of it's De∣livery, when every body was disposed to Applaud Church-Musick, by the irresistible charms of that Admirable performance; which by a ma∣nagement peculiar to your selves, laboured under no inconveniencies of Disorder or Confusion: Yet now that the Pulpit is no longer backed by the Organ-Loft; when that which was spoken from the One, is no longer supported by what was acted in the Other; I have just reason to fear, that it will but indifferently answer,

either the prepossessed Opinion of those who heard it, or the expectation of those that did not.
Notwithstanding this, since only I am to be the Sufferer, and not the Cause; (which has been already too well defended by Abler Pens, to undergo any prejudice by the weakness of mine;) I shall gladly run that hazard in Com∣pliance with your desire; and shall not dispute giving even this Dangerous Testimony, of that sincere Respect which shall be always paid you, by,
GENTLEMEN,
