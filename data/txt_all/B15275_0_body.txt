LOth to expose my first in∣deauours publique, to the broad abuse & open preiu∣dice of this iniurious & ca∣pricious Age (Reuerend Dean) and being wholy destitute of any dependance on the Patronage and Mecae∣naship of Great ones, with whose magni∣ficent Titles, Books of all sorts daily come mustring into the World. Whilst I be∣thought me to select some charitable Guardian, I know not what strong confi∣dence resoluing on the goodnesse of your nature, so preuailed with me, that I should presume to thrust forth these vnpolished and imperfect meditations vnder the au∣thoritie of your name. This poore Infant had for a while till some few sands were
 expired, a breathing, such as it was, within the confines of that renowned Church wherof the Prouidence of God hath made you a worthy Gouernor. When 'twas gon the importunitie of som Shunemites would haue it fetcht again. Vouchsafe (oh man of God) to send but the staffe of your Appro∣bation to lay vpon the face of the dead Child, and it shall receiue a happy reuiuall. I send it to you (Learned Sir) in the same words that old Iacob dismist his Sonnes, Now God Almightie giue thee mercie in the sight of the Man. Your fauourable accepta∣tion, shall for euer bind me to inuert the prayer on your selfe, The Almightie giue the Man mercie in the sight of God.
