Sir,
IF I promise to my self in this, the common ends of Dedications, I hope you will not condemn mee as un∣worthy in my aimes. I slatter not, as too many fawning Scriblers do, whilst I say this is to testifie my love to you; because I hope, through grace, your piety and Doctrine hath tyed mee to you by spiritual bonds: Neither can I judge my self base in my design, by this to ingratiate my self more into your favour; for I am ambitious of your ac∣quaintance: Neither am I ashamed to say, by this I begge your Patronage; for I am sensible of my own weakness, and you to bee not only able, but engaged, to defend this cause. I only presume to bee your armour-bearer, and whilst I may fight under your sheild, I doubt not but to give the enemy a stand; Whilst I was a spectatour of those furious shocks, whereby you shattered the choicest ranks of your enemies; and saw you deal about such fatal blows, that their choicest Champions fell before you; I was encouraged to give a diversion to this unworthy ene∣my that would fall upon you whilest you are ingaged in o∣ther encounters. Remember therefore I only ingage this e∣nemy in ambush, expecting that hee will flye as soon as hee sees one ready to enter the lists with him; but for the management of the Maine Battallia; I Leave it to your self, and to God, to whom I shall pray for your successe, and be ready to serve you and the Truth, in what I am able.
