I Pray let it not amuse you that these rude pa∣pers
salute you from so remote a corner of
the Land,Wales by them you may perceive some
scantling of the extent of your great virtues
and merits, and if they bring along a trou∣ble
to you in the perusall (even but of this one page) you
may thank your own goodnesse as accessary to it, who now
about 12 years past was pleased to afford a more then or∣dinary
acceptance to some poor leavs of the same Authors,
to which these do relate as to matter and subject, intitu∣led
The Parliament explained to Wales. And Sir, ha∣ving
remembred you of so much, I will now acquaint you
with almost a wonder, & that you wil hardly believ: I then
as I thought, having been delivered of that birth, yet I
have ever since, and still do, go in travail with it; for tru∣ly
ever since that time I parted from you, at your then
house at Islington, I never scarce enjoyed a good hour all
along of those leaves, what with reproaches now, threats

and dangers then, I praise God, my patience hath under∣gon
no small temptations;or, quid non Par∣liamentū but how? and how far? you
shall briefly otherwise be informed, onely let me add, may
the Lord send us less Law, and more Iustice, hoping that
those worthies and you, whom God hath so signally owned,
and who already have done so great things, and much
more is expected from, will hold it no great matter of
difficulty, to relieve and rescue a poor oppressed friend
(suffering in, and for your Cause) from the phangs of
Laws & malicious Malignants. Indeed I did lately, in the
late Ld Protectors time, make some speciall applications
to those of my Country-men eminent about him, for my
protection and indempnity, but they were so intent upon
their ambition, that they would not remember poor Jo∣seph,
and what was offered in my behalfe to their Sym∣pathy
they did not Christian-like lay it to their hearts,
but courtier-like clap it in their pockets, for which I wish
them forgiveness; But Sir, these leaves, whatever their
matter and handling is, I am sure their tendency is good,
the first Edition was three years past, to the then Prote∣ctor;
but still my said Country-men, to whose hands, af∣ter
a chargeable winter journey, I trusted them (it seems
jealous they should tell some tales) still obstructed them.
This second Edition because mostly occasioned, through
some passages unto me,M. Bax∣ter in order to them from an excellent
man (whose name I know it precious to you and all good
men) I send forth under your patronage (for honest men
and books had need to be well garded these times) for so
much as is mine, as I then said, they pretend no higher
inspiration, then some harmeless reading, and truths
(as wise men say) lying in abdito, may haply sometimes
be descryed amidst the shades of woods and mountains,
rather then in the noyse and throng of the world: they

tend to the discovery of the evills of extreams, and as the
same rare soul said,M Baxter all overdoing in the work
of God, is undoing: This solely hinders our
happinesse, and I verily believe, this spirit of dissention
was never neerer a discoverie then now; and I hope such
a spirit as was between Joseph and his Brethren, is ma∣king
toward us, and then not only England, but great
Brittain for ever happy, and for ever glorious, and I hope
those poor leaves, and especially, what is of Mr. BAXTERS,
will abundantly contribute towards that great felicity.
Aud truely it is most pitious, that amongst Christians,
all parties being so near together in their principles,
should be so wide, and distant in their affections; not
unlike, as is reported of some spired mountains with us
in Wales, where shepheards may talk one with the other
on the tops,In sumsis eorum ver∣ticibus pastores confa∣bulantes a mane ad vesperam vix conve∣nirent. Cambden. ex Gyr. but scarce can meet together in a
days travail; so in the many necessaries,
aud fundamentalls, we come all close together
yet unhappily, for some lower opinions and
circumstantialls, we ever stand at distance
and will never shake hands: and it would please God
all good men would duely lay it to heart, what a wound
Religion, and Christianity suffers thereby, and to look be∣yondour
selvs, & to consider, that even Turks & Pagans
are confirmed in their superstitious darknesse, by our di∣visions,
and the only way to hasten this great blessing to
our selves, and the world, would be, for all good Christi∣ans,
especially of the Ruleing and Ministeriall rank, by
degrees, to suffer those false fires (for lights I dare hardly
call them) of passion and prejudice, clean to go out in
them, and to let, right Reason, and Grace, Gods two great
luminaries, kindly to rule and shine in their Orbes, their
minds and intellects. But HONOURABLE SIR,

Not to keep you from your great affairs too long in this
Porch, and to end with one word more to my self, truely
SIR, I find my drooping thoughts not a little revived,
behold the prange disposings of divine providence before
our eyes,to that after a harsh Comma given to the Old-Cause
and Parliament, methinks like those rivers in∣gulfed
into the Earth, after a great space have again their
resurrection; or like the glorious eye of Heaven Eclipsed
by the saucy moon, recovers and appears to the World in
it's former luster. These should be wonderous things in
our eyes, the same great invisible hand that wrought all
this protect, and direct them and you in the great concern∣ments
of his name and glory among us. By this much I
verily believe yo do perceive, I am one that would fain be
bungling and doing of some good, might I be but left qui∣etin
my privacie to steal through the World, and to bee
from the injuries,Protected and malice of wicked malignant ene∣mies,
and like the snail to retire and live (without mole∣station)
in the shell of my own poor enjoyments is all my
ambition, and if your piety wil be pleased to prove the In∣strument
of God to obtain me but thus much, and what com∣pensation
for my great wrongs, (in any proportion as
they shall be made appear) as shall seem good to justice, I
do not doubt but Almighty God will give a plentifull re∣turn
of blessings into your bosome for it, and my prayers
shall ever faithfully be for you and all the other Worthy
Patriots at our Helm, for the Lordlong to continue & di∣rect
them and you for his glory amongst us, even to the
fulfilling of that blessing of the Prophet in these our days,
for Iustice to slow like a stream, and Iudgment like a
mighty torrent throughout all the parts of the Land.
Honourable Sir,
