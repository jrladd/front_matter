IT will not (I hope) bee thought vnprofitable, (R. Reuerend Father in God) that in this time of peace and flouri∣shing prosperitie of our Church and Country▪ I write of our warfare with the world, and our combat with afflictions, seeing we haue no assurance that these tempo∣rall blessings and Halcyon daies will be conti∣nued; but rather may probably expect & iustly feare, that according to that vicissitude and mu∣tuall interchange of worldly things, which both the scriptures & the experience of all ages past haue made knowne vnto vs, there may happily
 come a wane after this full, a low ebbe after this high tide, and a darke night of sorrow and mourning, after this bright sunshine day of gladnesse and reioycing. And that the rather, because by our sinnes long agoe wee haue de∣serued to bee dispoiled of Gods long continu∣ed fauours, and with vnresistable violence doe pull and hale his iust iudgements vpon our guilty heads. For to say nothing of the despe∣rate wickednesse of prophane men, who being rotten members of this body of our Church and Countrey, doe deserue to be cut off (which is not commonly effected without the griefe and smart of all those sounder parts which are neere about them) who doth not see that the best seruants and dearest children of God, are by long ease growne so slothfull and secure, and so corrupted with continuall peace and prosperitie; that they need to bee quickened and rouzed vp with Gods scourges of correcti∣on, and to bee purged from their drosse and rust by the fiery triall? And therefore it will not bee amisse, if in this summer and sunshine of our prosperity, wee erect shelters to shade vs against the stormy tempests of approching
 troubles; and in the daies of our peace, doe prepare our selues for this spirituall warfare, building fortresses and bulwarks for our de∣fence before wee bee assaulted by the enemie, and putting on our spirituall armour, before our great Commander doe summon vs to the fight, and cause the alarme to be sounded to the battell. For then shall wee most securely inioy our peace, when as we stand vpon our guard, and haue our weapons in readinesse to resist the enemy; and then shall our ioy of prosperity bee most sweet and delightfull, when it is not em∣bittered with the feare of losing it, nor with the expectation of those afflictions, whose force and fury wee are by due preparati∣on enabled to ouercome. Yea though the body of our state had a sound constitution, and did not onely for the present inioy the health of flourishing prosperitie, but were al∣so assured that it would continue for the time to come: yet are there many members of it, which being diseased with the sores of afflicti∣on, doe need to haue the plaisters of comfort applied vnto them. And though the whole ar∣mie of our Church militant do not yet ioyne
 in a maine battell with these spirituall enemies, yet are there many of Gods souldiers picked out by our Lord and Generall, to skirmish in their courses with them, who need to be instru∣cted in this spirituall warfare, and to be so trai∣ned in the skill of this fight, that when they are assaulted, they may manfully stand vnto it and obtaine the victory. In which respects, I ten∣dring the future benefit of the whole body, and the present good of euery particular member, haue vndertaken this paines in prepa∣ring them for this fight. In which my ende∣uors, if God so blesse mee, that I attaine vnto my end I shall haue no small ioy, seeing I shall communicate with them in all their consolati∣on, and triumph together in their victorious conquest. Or if I faile hereof, yet shall I not lose all my labour, seeing whilest I prouided these cordials of comfort for the curing of o∣thers, I my selfe haue been cheered by them in my wants and weakenesse; and whilest I cooked others meat, haue somewhat staied my fainting stomack by licking mine own fingers, & tasting of these meats, as they passed thorow my hands.
Now these my labours I humbly offer to
 your Graces patronage, as an vnfained testimo∣ny of that loue and duty which your worth and merit doe iustly challenge. For if the Elder that doth gouerne well, bee worthy of double ho∣nour, especially if hee labour painfully in the word and doctrine; how much are wee bound to shew by all meanes, with what zeale wee ho∣nour you, who by your gouernement (as chiefe Liuetenant vnder our dread Soueraign) preserue among vs the purity of our christian religion, from being tained and corrupted by errours and heresies (herein extending your care not only vnto vs, but also to our neigh∣bour Churches round about vs) and conti∣nue with increase the peace of our Church, defending vs all you may, from the in∣roades and inuasions of our Romish enemies: and also (as though you were quite freed from the waight of this burthen) doe continually imploy your selfe in sound doctrine, and pain∣full preaching; not only vrging those, who are vnder your gouernment to take like fruitfull paines, by your graue authority, fatherly ad∣monitions, and earnest exhortations; but also shaming those who neglect it, by your exam∣ple,
 seeing they come farre short of you, in that which they haue only to intend, who are other∣wise taken vp in such multitude of busines. The which I write not to get vnto my self the base re∣ward of a seruile flatterer, (for who yet could e∣uer challenge me of such self-respecting flatte∣ry) but that God may bee glorified in those ex∣cellēt gifts wherewith he hath inriched you; and that they being continued vpon this record for after ages, you may not only be acknowledged a worthy President & Gouernour vnto vs, but be imitated as a praecedent & pattern vnto those who shall come after you; and so leaue behind you such a sweet sent of a good name, as it were of a pretious ointment, that those who yet breathe not, may be refreshed by it.
The Lord long continue, increase and mul∣tiply these his good gifts and graces in you, that hee more and more may haue the glory of them, his Church & children the vse & benefit, & your self both the present comfort of a good conscience, and the greater measure of glory & happinesse at the day of Christs appearing.
