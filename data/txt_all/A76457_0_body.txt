Noble Sir,
I Am very sensible, how deep a Wound the taking away of Her, who was the Desire of your eyes, made in your brest; and therefore I have been very unwilling to present you with this Picture, lest the Colours, with which it is drawn, should renew the wound, and make it bleed afresh: This was the only reason, that hitherto, I was so hardly brought to represent it to your view. But now, I begin to call to mind, that though the Originall was an incomparable piece, yet he that drew the Copy: did it with an unskilfull hand: I am content therefore, upon your Importunity, to let you cast your eye upon it, in stead of a Foile: But I am very Confident withall, upon my Importunity, you will more easily suppresse it, and suffer it only to lye with∣in your private walls, among your other Papers. It will be satisfaction enough for you, and for Her friends, to
 Know, How much She deserved, how much you desired, and how much the Workman endeavoured, but was not able to perform. For my part, I am easily perswaded both to pardon, and please my self with that of the Poët,
In magnis voluisse sat est,—
In things that are hard and difficult, The Will is to be accepted for the Deed: And if I can but purchase so much favour at your hands, you shall Challenge, what pro∣portion you please, both in the sincerest Affections, and most Earnest Devotions of
Waddon Dec. 2. 1652.
(Sir)
