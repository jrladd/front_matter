THis Sermon was lately preached at your Gra∣ces Visitation; and now being willing to shew it selfe vnto others, aswell as vnto those that heard it, presents it selfe with all humility to your gracious hands, desiring to giue it your blessing, before it walke abroad, euen That with which Iacob sent his sonnes into E∣gypt, that God would giue it mercy

in the sight of the man; in the sight of the Schismaticall man, to make him conformable; in the sight of the con∣formable man, to keepe in straight paths; in the sight of the idle Shepherd, to stirre him vp to feede Gods Flocke; in the sight of the paynefull Labourer, not to pull his hand from the plow, but to perseuere in Gods haruest: So God continue to direct your Grace in all weighty affaires, to Gods glory, and the good of his Church, and your owne soules comfort.
