SHould I (right worshihful) as flatterers
are woont to doe, set downe a Cata∣logue
of your commendations, and en∣ter
into a Laborinth of loue toward
you, I know your wits so good, that you
would quickly espie it, and I confesse
mine owne nature such, as I hartily
hate. My present purpose then at this time, is neither to
rehearse your many stinde fauours, which I knowe you
rather loue priuately to enlarge, then listen publikely to
heare laide open; nor report mine owne vnthankfulnes,
which I am sorie hath beene so much, yet you will for∣get,
although it were farre more: bui as a dutifull remem∣brance
of both these, though not able to be shadowed
in one subiect, yet sufficient (in your conceits I know)
being but in part acknowledged, I send you this honou∣rable
Historie of Prince Palmerin of England, which
cost mee no more paiues in writing, then I hope it will be
pleasing to you in reading.



This first part is but to relish your tast, how yee can
like of such worthy Knights loues, and memorable ad∣uentures,
whereof at my last being with you in the Coun∣trie,
I sawe yee vse no mislike. Then finding such gentle
entertainment, as I make no question of, the second part
shall bee with you very speedily after. So committing
your worship, and my sweete Mistresse your
wife, to the heauenly protection,
I remaine yours to my
vttermost.
