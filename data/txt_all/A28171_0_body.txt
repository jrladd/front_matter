Christian Reader,
THe holie and learned Author of this little Book, having out-run his years, hastned to a maturity before the ordinary season, in so much that ripe Summer Fruit was found with him by the first of the Spring: for before he had lived twenty five years compleat, he had got to be Philologus, Philosophus, Theologus, eximi∣us, whereof he gave sutable proofs, by his labors, having first professed in Philosophy three years, with high appro∣bation, in the Universitie of Glasgow, and thence was translated to the Ministrie of the Gospel in a Congrega∣tion adjacent, where he laboured in he work of the Gos∣pel near four years, leaving an epistle of commendation upon the hearts of his Hearers: But as few burning and shining lights have been of long continuance here: so he (after he had served his own generation by the wil of God and many had rejoiced in his light for a season) was quicklie transported to the land of Promise, in the 26th, year of his age. He lived deservedly esteemed & beloved, and died much lamented, by all descerning Christians who knew him: And, indeed, the loss which the Churches of Christ in these parts, sustained in his death, w he greater upon a double account: First, that he was a per∣son fitted with dexteritie to vindicate School divinitie, and Practical Theology▪ from the superfluity of vain and fruitless perplexing questions, wherewith latter times have corrupted both, and  it upon his spirit in all his way to reduce that native Gospel-simplicitis, which (in most parts of the world, where literature is in esteem, and where the Gospel is preached) is almost exiled from the School and from the Pulpit; a specimen whereof the judicious Reader may find in this little Treatis. Besides e was a person of eminent moderation, and sobrietie of

spirit (a rare grace in this generation) whose heart was much drawn forth in the study of healing wayes and con∣deseensions of love among Brethren; one who longed for the recovering of the Humanity of Christianity, which hath been well near lost in the bitter divisions of these times, and the animosities which have followed therupon.
That which gave the rise to the publishing of this part of his manuscripts, was partly the longing of many (who knew him) after some fruit of his labours, for the use of the Church; and partly the exceeding great usefulness of the Treatise, wherein, I am bold to say, that some funda∣mentals of the Christian Religion & great Mysteries of Faith, are handled with the greatest Gospel-simplicity & most dexterious plainness, & are brought down to the meanest capacitie, and vulgar understanding, with a∣bundant evidence of a great height and reach of usefull knowledge in the Author. Who had he lived to have per∣fected the explication of the grounds of Religion in this manner, as he intended, in his opening the Catechisme unto his particular Congregation, he had been, upon this single account, famous in the Churches of Christ: But now, by this imperfect opus post humum, thou are left to judge ex ungue leonem.
The Authors Method was his peculiar gift, who being no stranger to the Rules of Art, knew well how to make his method subserve the matter which he handled for though he tell not alwayes that his discourse hath so many parts, thou mayst not think it wants method, it being ma∣ximum artis celare artem, that the same spirit which enabled him to conceive, & communicate to others, these sweet mysteries of Salvation, may help thee with profite to read and peruse them, is the desire of him who is
