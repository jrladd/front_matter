Right Worshipfll, and Worthy SIR.
THe great outcryes which haue beene made in England, vpon the last newes which came out of the East-Indies, about a certayne ex∣ecution which was done in the Iland of Am∣boyna, in March, 1623. because we see the great desire that your Worship hath, to keep good correspondence betwixt these two Nations, it hath caused me (beyond my owne curiosity) to search & inqire after theright & true beginnings, procedings, and issues of these affaires, vpon which this execution followed. Wherein, I per∣swade my selfe, I haue attained good successe, by such meanes as I haue vsed, and by my good acquaintance, so that (at the last) I am come to the cleare light of the matter▪ partly by the letters that haue beene sent home, to the Company here, and declared to the States Generall, as also by a particular examination of the pro∣cesse made against them in Amboyna, before their execution, and sent ouer hither, in writing, which at this present hath caused mee to write this vnto your Worship, that so, the truth may bee made knowne concerning this busines in all places, where your Worthynes, and respect, can, or may bring it to passe; that so your Worship, and all true well willers (of our Countrey,) may be no otherwise thought of than wee deserue.
