IT was long before the vse of Notes and Tableture came in to our English Presse, but hauing found the way, there are few Nations yeeld more Impressions in that kind then ours. Euery Musition according to his abilitie increasing the number. Among so ma∣ny, I haue now made one, yeelding my priuate in∣uentions subiect to publicke censure: To which ad∣uenture I was drawen by two reasons. First, that I might shew my hum∣ble duetie, and gratefull minde to you my two Honourable Masters, whose bountie bestowed on me that knowledge (whatsoeuer it is) that I haue attain'd in Musicke; Next for that I am assured, that both the wor∣thinesse of your Names, as also your loues to Musicke, and extraordinary skils therein, either to expresse, or Masterly to compose, will bee such a protection to my deuoted labours, that I shall not need to feare the blacke breath of any enuious detractor. All my desire is, that your fauou∣rable acceptance will better them, for I shall esteeme them as you receiue them. So, as my duetie requires; I will dayly pray for you both, as my bountifull Masters, and worthiest Patrons.
