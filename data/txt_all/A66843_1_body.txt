Dear Mistress,
THe sublimity of yo Lady Mothers affairs I fear will not permit her very often to view this

book; besides, her Ladiship needs it not; her acceptati∣on and approbation hereof is my honour only, not her benefit; your practice will be my content, and I doubt ot your own. It is a mise∣ble thing for any Wo∣n, though never so great,  to be able to teach her ants; there is no fear of it in you, since you begin so soon to delight in those Sciences as may and will accomplish you; this Book

I hope will afford you som∣thing; and whatever else you know in me to serve you, be pleased freely to command; I shall alwayes be ready to express my self
Dear Mistress, Your neigned Real Sevant in all Humility and affection
