AS from the Hill
of Hermons Heau'nly tops,
Most Sacred Dewe
on Sion Mountaines drops:
Which falling further to the lower ground,
Doth make the Fields with fruits diuine abound;



So may that Hermon-Dewe be dropping still,
On thee (chiefe Montaigne) of Pauls-Sion Hill;
That so Her lower grounds may fruitfull be,
And She (poor Church) made fortunate by Thee:
For which I pray, these Blessings may ensue,
Health, Plenty, Peace, Ioy, and Long-life to You.
