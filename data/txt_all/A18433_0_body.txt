I Had no sooner en∣ded this Sermon (rightworshipful) but some of my ve¦ry familiar friends wished, and in ma¦ner vrged me to cōmend the same o you, or to the good Lady your wife: vnto whose request I thought good the rather to yeeld, for that I knewe right well what stoare you made of the Word,Mat. 13.46 being a pearle of greate price, a rich treasure, and n incomparable Iewell,Mat. 13.44 the very ode of mans soule, the sworde of he spirit,Eph. 6.17. Heb. 4.12. more sharpe thā any two dged swoorde, which entreth hrough, euen vnto the deuiding sunder of the soule, and the spirit,
 and of the ioynts, and the maro In consideration whereof, I off this my poore trauell vnto you praying you to accept the same, as token of my good wil. And albe I cannot compare with the rich who of their superfluities are won to adde vnto the offerings of God yet I of my penurie am willing with the poore widowe,Luk. 21.2. to cast i the substance I haue, euen the mit to the augmentation of the trea¦sury of the Lord. Which if I per¦ceaue to be accepted, your worship shall encourage mee to greater tra¦uelles. And so I betake you to the Lorde. Heuytre. The second of Ianuary. 1579.
