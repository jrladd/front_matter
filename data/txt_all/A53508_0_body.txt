SIR,
I Have presumed to Dedicate this plain Discourse, touching the Eternal Deliverance of the World, to your Illustrious High∣ness, to whom, under God, and our Gracious Soveraign, is chiefly owing a very considerable Temporal Deliverance to this Nation.
For without your Highness's great Zeal and Interest, and generous Example, to several Right Noble and willing Lords and Patriots, to support the Evidence, (and some miraculous Providences intervening) it hardly had fail'd, but that Might and Craft had quite stifled and over-laiden the Truth in weak Hands, and brought a dismal Deluge of Blood and slavery upon the Nation, both our Princes and People, in an instant, before Men had been awake, or aware.
It is not for my weak Pen, to recount the Merits of your Highness, and your renowned Courage, and innumerable hazards, and perils, and sufferings, in our behalf, whereby you are most great and dear to all, by being so cheap to your self: nor the Loveliness of your generous sincerity, and Patronage of the Protestant Religion, without changing, or doubting, or fear, where∣by you are, under his Most Gracious Majesty, a great Darling to all English Hearts, lessing God for you throughout the Nation, not any perhaps of the most seduc'd Sects amongst us, dissenting in this common Vote and Acclama∣tion. Yea, well might I blush, at the meanness of this Present to so great a Prince, but that I trust, through your Highness's candid Construction and Acceptance, to convey therein, for want of a better Instance, some represen∣tation and assurance of that large and eternal Gratitude of my Heart and Soul which, I trust, no Power on Earth can ever make me ashamed to acknow∣ledge and maintain, amongst the rest of his Majesties good Subjects, towards your Highness, while I am, what I ever ought, and shall be,
