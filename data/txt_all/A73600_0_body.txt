Worthy Ladies,
LAmentable are the ruines, into which the na∣tures of men
 are generally fallen by their sinnes; which ap∣peares especially by the waies men take in the busi∣nesse of their soule: The most men are cleane out of the way to heauen, and walke in by-waies of their owne, which are called in Scripture, the wayes of the wicked; the wayes of their owne hearts; Peruerse wayes; Darke and slipperie wayes; The way of iniquitie: All meeting in that broad way that leadeth to destruction, being wholly ignorant of the way of life and peace; yea, the most of them speake euill of the good way
 of God, and persecute it. Some there are, that are so farre inlightned, as not to like the common roade∣way of the multitude; and after some inquiry haue found them out wayes that seeme good in their owne eyes; and they are wonder∣fully well pleased with their course, but the issues of these wayes are death too, as well as the former: and the more is this danger in∣creased vpon men, be∣cause the way of life is but one, and it is a narrow way, and hard to finde, and may bee sought by many, and yet not found: Yet this
 hope is left vnto forlorne men, that there is a way to heauen and happinesse: A way of righteousnesse and peace, a way of mercy and truth, of wisedome: A way that men may securely and safely walke in; a way, in which Christ will guide them, God the Father will keepe them, and the holy Ghost leade them by the hand, and direct them in all the passages thereof: Onely it concerneth vs to aske the way, with all im∣portunity, of God, and to attend vnto the directions of the word of God, and apply our hearts, and suf∣fer
 our selues to bee dispo∣sed aright, that our eyes may see the saluation of God: and in particular we must look to three things: First, that if the Lord shew vs that mercy to direct vs in the way, wee must take heed that wee neglect not, or despise not the care of wal∣king in the way: Second∣ly, that with all diligence we auoide going about, and make straight steps to our feet: and thirdly, with all feare watch our selues, that wee fall not off with the errours of the wicked, from the good way of God, and so our latter end bee
 worse then our beginning.
I haue vndertaken by the assistance of God, and the directions of his bles∣sed Word, to single out the choisest things I could finde in the Scriptures, concerning the entrance into this way of God, and those first pathes which are called holy. The substance of these directi∣ons I haue digested into the Treatise following, which I dedicate vnto your Ladiships, as a testi∣mony of my thankfulnesse, for the respect you haue shewed vnto my Ministe∣rie, both in your constant
 resort vnto it in the weeke daies, while you liued in a neighbour Parish; and in that two of you are plea∣sed to come to liue a∣mongst vs, and so are be∣come a part of my charge; as also to mani∣fest to the world my ob∣seruance of your Ladi∣ships, for the good report you haue amongst the godly for the grace of Ie∣sus Christ, and your vn∣faigned loue of the truth: Beseeching your Accepta∣tion, Perusall, and Patronage of these, I take my leaue, and commend your Ladi∣ships to the God of mercy
 and truth, who guide, comfort, deliuer, sanctifie, and preserue you all vnto the Day of Iesus Christ.
