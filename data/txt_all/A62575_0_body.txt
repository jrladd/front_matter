SIR,
SInce that too favourable Account which those wor∣thy Gentlemen, that heard my Sermon, gave you of it, has out-weighed those Reasons which I offer'd against Printing it, and you have so far taken their Character of it, rather than mine, as to joyn with them in soliciting me to make it Publick, I do here present you with it just as I delivered it, without the least Alteration, or any Addition, except of a few Lines in the Close, which concern some Matters that I was not then fully instructed in.
If any shall be prevailed upon by any thing I have said, to imitate so fair an Example as you have set them, I shall repent of nothing relating to the Publish∣ing
of this plain Discourse, but that I have so long delay'd complying with your Desires.
May you, Sir, live to see not only your great De∣signs accomplish'd, but Justice done you in a more full and perfect account of them, by some of those Children for whose Education you are making such Charitable Provision: But if they should hold their Peace, the very Stones you have laid will cry out, and tran∣smit you honourably to Posterity. I am, Sir,

Worcester, Novemb. 1st. 1695.
