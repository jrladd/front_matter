HOwsoever I haue hereto-fore saluted your whole society, in that vnfayned af∣fection which I beare vnto you all; yet, n being in some particuler engagements more bound to some in speciall, then to all in gene∣rall; I presume vpon your kinde acceptance of this poore manifestation of my loue to you, having had large experience of yours, to me. A small token is welcome from a true freind; and I nothing doubt but this shalbe the better entertayned, not only be∣cause it is sent from such a one, but also, for that it contayneth matter of Advantage, and that (as I trust I may boldely say) to your selues, as vnto those, who desyring, and endeavouring to be of that number to whome these most worthy preiveledges doe ap∣pertayne, shall (in your due seeking) be right sure to enjoy, those many & most blessed benefitts, which are here by vs discovered, and by God himself en∣tayled, to all his faithfull ones, for ever. And inas∣much as it is noe good decorum to make a long E∣pistle, to a litle booke, I am more breife with you then (otherwise) my loue would let me be, which
 could much more enlarge it self, if it were meete (at present) soe to doe. But, what is not convenient now to say to your selues, I shall not cease to vtter in my poore requests for you vnto him, who is Lord over all, and rich vnto all: To whose grace, & loue, I leaue you, and all that are yours, beseeching him to enrich you with all the graces of his good spirit, that may giue you a blessed, and abundant entrance into his glorious Kingdome, by Iesus Christ, both your Lord, and ours; in whome I rest

From my house in Flushing, March 7. 1623.
