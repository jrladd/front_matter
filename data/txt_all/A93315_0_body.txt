TWo things have much moved my affections unto this Work follow∣ing;
1. The one, that herein I might shew an humble acknowledgment of love unto the Lord who delivered my soul from under those obscurities which would utterly have disabled me from being good to my own heart or others.
2. That I might herein become a means of staying and directing many an unestablish∣ed soul to beware of those horrible Delusi∣ons and mysterious Deceits, which I have in this ensuing Treatise, with as much plain∣ness
and brevity as I judged convenient, de∣monstrated, for the sake of all who are unac∣quainted with these Apostacies, and are wil∣ling to search out untill they gain an esta∣blishment in the knowledg of the truth, as it is in Christ Jesus. For it would have been great unworthiness in me, if when I was brought so experimentally to the knowledg of these unheard-of ways of Satans decei∣ving the hearts of poor Creatures under fair pretences and glorious shews of righteous∣ness, and doing great signs and wonders, I should have concealed from my generations such things that were never yet manifested in such a manner: The writing of common experiences either of good or evil operati∣ons, would neither have been an incitement to my Pen, or my Readers attention; but ha∣ving an extraordinary understanding in an extraordinary apparition of a prodigious Comet, whose beautifull scintillations make all the World to wonder what might be her fate, I durst not for fear of wronging my own conscience, but put my Light like a Candle upon the house-top, that so it might be seen into all the Regions of Gospel-pro∣fessions,
manifesting unto them, that this Monster amongst men, or this unnatural and unparalleld Planet promiseth nothing but Vae misero mihi, sadness and loss of all the riches of Gods grace, unto every soul that liveth under its malevolent and contagious influences. My Book will expound my Al∣legory, therefore I leave my Readers to that, and rest,
