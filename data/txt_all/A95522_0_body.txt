BRave, Bold, Adventerors, and unmatchable
Patrons, It was my chance (long since) to read
a witty Pamphlet, Intituled, Peirce Penniles
his Supplication, It was Dedicated to the De∣vill,
there were in it many Satyricall true Jerks,
Jybes, Iests, and Ieeres, which reflected and
trencht much upon the Graund Signior Sultan Sathans Reputa∣tion,
which were much distastfull to his Infernall Hell-hood,
with all the rest of his Members of that Lower House. In l∣mitation
of that Supplication, dedicated to the Devill, I am
bold to Dedicate this my Satyricall Poem to you his deare Adop∣ted
Sons (the Rebells) not doubting, but you will Patronize it,
and Reward the Writer, as your Father would have done Tom
Nash, for his Penniles Volumne; I know that you have more
Power then your Syre, and for State Policy, you have so farre
gone beyond him, that he blushes for shame, to heare how the
World laughes him to scorne, for being out-strip'd and over∣reach'd
in his owne Art, by his owne Sons, Schollers, and Ser∣vants.
He did once (sawcily and foolishly) offer to give all the
Kingdomes of the World, but you are better Husbands then to




give Kingdomes, for you have done your best and worst to take
Kingdomes and Principalities, you have sold Ireland, and the
Lives and Estates of 100000 People there, and with the Mo∣neys
which you received from your Mungrell Merchant Ad∣venturers
for Irish Land, you have bought, or hired, Scottish
Rebells on purpose to make an English Invasion. To effect which
most unparalell'd designes, your Pulpits, and Pamphlets have
been most diligent and usefull Aggravators and Propagators,
amongst whom, and of which unnumber'd Numberlesse, dam∣nable
Number▪ Captaine George Wyther, is not to be accoun∣ted
a small Foole; His Campo-Musae, doth declare the Gentle∣mans
Loyalty with his Book, called, Brittaines Remembrancer,
(in the 8th and 9th Cantoes) doe shew his Art in Adulation, and
whosoever either hath read, or will or can read, understand and
consider those his two Books, may palpably perceive the constancy
of this Capricious Carpet Captaine, and also discerne what
Spirit of Contradiction inspir'd his Muse. I have briefly Writ
this my Satyre as a gentle Reproofe of his Perfidious unmannerly
Mutability, wherein you may descry not onely his Rebellious
Legerdemaine, but all his Maintainers, Patrons, Adorers,
Admirers, and Rewarders, may see and be sorry for their Er∣rors;
He was a man that I have these 35 yeares loved and re∣spected,
because I thought him simply honest; But now his con∣ceal'd
Hypocrifie is by himselfe discovered, I am bold to take leave
of him in these following lines.
