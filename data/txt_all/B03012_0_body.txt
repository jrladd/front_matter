Most Illustrious Madam,
THere is nothing in this world of more importance then to handle the affairs of Salvation with all earnest∣ness; we well know we have an im∣mortal soul which shall survive to all Eter∣nity either in the bosom of Glory, or in the flames of the damned; nothing is so abso∣lutely confirm'd, as that none can be saved without true faith, and yet nothing by the malice of satan more controverted as the ve∣rity of true faith. This small Treatise con∣triv'd in hast for, and in vindication of, the verity of the ancient soul-saving faith of the Roman-Catholick Church, from the most misterious and foul aspersions and railings of the ignorant over-weening and over-byass'd Sciolist Sectaries of this perverse age, confidently flyes for to be sheltred un∣der the wings of the most Renown'd Patro∣nage of your Eminency, a most rare ho∣nourer and vigorous practitioner of the hea∣venly Principles and tenents of the same ancient faith: what? an inestimable precious
Jewel of fair,  v and rich Modena, mo∣ to all height of beauty and  orth (whose Royal blood of in∣ing nonour springs from the most glori∣, most august, and most heavenly stock and oins of the Emperor of Germany, of that thrice noble and ancient house of Austria; and of the most Catholick Kings of Spain,) now to contract strong alliances with the usefull and practical doctrin of the rare ver∣tues of pennance, humility, mortification, piety, charity and fasting, &c. all contradi∣ctory to flesh and blood? what? a tender young, beauteous, eminently great Lady, seen often daily paying the Religious ho∣mage of heart, hand, & knees to the Majesty of the Almighty, by frequent retreats to a sweet and undisturbed Conversation with heaven, and this in the Royal Court, is the fair sport of your beauteous minde, little re∣garding the transient vanities, guilded goades, and charming gaities, and allure∣ments of a barren world, all which ends in folly and forgetfulness; O how mervelous is the power of solid vertue, when enchaced in pure beauty and glorious Extraction! Live then prosperously most pious Madam, and be still a bright orient star of the first magnitude, now auspiciously fix'd in this Orb of Great Britain, shining, illuminating and warming (by your heroick and most
examplar piety) frozen hearts in this cold for them Clime. Live then fortunatly pre∣vailing Madam who (by Gods sweet pro∣vidence) has been heightn'd to so sublime merit, unparallel'd worth and admir'd ac∣complishments of all perfections as to be∣come the Peerless Consort of his Royal Highness James, that most gracious, migh∣ty and most invincible Heroe, now the un∣mated glory, the onely moving Soul, and most victorious Tutelar Angel of Great Britain: Live long and prosperously, Great Madam, until you enjoy in your bosom (through Gods blessings) a Princely Graff arising from so Noble, soveraign and glori∣ous a stock, for the comfort and full joy and succour of Great Britain. Most serene Ma∣dam, this my Address is far from a Panege∣rick, in enlarging upon the eminent splen∣dor of your Endowments of minde and bo∣dy; those I leave for a fitter Subject of a higher Undertaking: Advance therefore Fair Madam your glorious progressions in vertues till you draw love and admiration even from your very Enemies (if any you can have.) I pray God to continue your Highness in all encreasing prosperities, to bless your just designs, and to prolong your happy days, these shall be the daily vowes of me, who beseeches your Highness to be∣stow one grace, which is, to permit me to




bear all my life time the Title of your m humble and most Obedient Chaplain a Beads-man,
