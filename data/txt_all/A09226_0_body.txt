YOur vertues famed by your fortunes,
and fortunes renowned by your ver∣tues
(thryce honorable Generalles) to∣gether
with the admiration the worlde
hath worthly conceiued of your woor∣thines:
haue at this time encouraged mee, a man not
vnknowne to many of your braue and forwarde follow∣ers,
Captaynes and Souldiers, to send my short farewell
to our English forces. VVherevnto I haue annexed
an olde Poeme of myne owne, The tale of Troy. A
pleasaunt dysconrse, fitly seruing to recreate, by the rea∣ding
the chiualrie of England. To whom, as to your in∣genious
iudgements, I dedicate the same: that good
mindes enflamed wyth honorable reports of their aun∣cestry,
may imitate theyr glory in highest aduentures.
And my Countrymen famed through the worlde for
resolution and fortitude, may marche in equipage of
honour and Armes, wyth theyr glorious and renowned
predicessors the Troyans.
Beseeching God mercifully and miraculously, as he∣therto
he hath doone, to defend fayre England, that
her Souldiours may in theyr departure bee fortunate,
and in theyr returne tryumphant.
