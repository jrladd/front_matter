Most excellent Prince;
ACcording to
the true du∣tie
of a ser∣uant,
I inten∣ded
all my
Contemplations to your

now-glorious Brother, of
sweet and sorrowfull memo∣ry.
The first part whereof,
as it was the last Booke that
euer vvas dedicated to that
deare, and immortall name
of his: so it was the last, that
was turned ouer by his grati∣ous
hand.
Now, since it pleased
the GOD of spirits to call
him from these poore Con∣templations
of ours, to the
blessed Contemplation of him∣selfe,

to see him as he is, to
see, as he is seene; to whom is
this sequel of my labours due,
but to your Highnes, the heire
of his Honour, and vertues?
Euery yeere of my short pil∣grimage,
is like to adde som∣thing
to this Worke; which in
regard of the subiect, is scarce
finite: The whole dooth not
onely craue your Highnesses
Patronage, but promises to
requite your Princely accep∣tation,
with many sared ex∣amples▪
and rules, both for

piety, and wisedome; towards
the decking vp of this flouri∣shing
spring of your Age;
in the hopes whereof, not
onely vvee liue, but hee
that is dead, liues still in
you: And if any peece
of these indeuours come
short of my desires, I shall
supplie the rest vvith my
prayers: vvhich shall ne∣uer
bee vvanting to the
GOD of Princes, that
your▪ happy proceedings may
make glad the Church of

GOD, and your selfe in
either World, glorious.
