MY LORD,
WHEN I consider You are the Duke of ALBEMARLE, the very Title is so Great, that it puts a damp on my Quill, and disables me from making any sufficient Apology for this presumptuous Dedication; But on the other hand, when I consider that You are Heir
to Your now Glorious Fathers Vertues, as well as to his Titles and Dignities; and that his Goodness and Humility are entailed on You his only Son, I cannot want a Motive to this Ambition. My Lord, This Volume is a Cos∣mographical and Geographical Description of the WORLD, in which Your Name is great and precious; and although in it self is excellent, yet being Countenanced by Your Pro∣tection will admit of no Equals. This being granted by Your Grace's Favour, I have no more to beg, but that Your Fathers Magna∣nimity, Valour, Grandure and Heroick Actions may be so deeply imprinted on You, that these Kingdoms may not only love and admire You, but that Your Name and Me∣mory may be precious to future Ages; which is the Prayer of,
MY LORD,
