IF the painefull la∣bours
of the Lear∣ned
(right Hono∣rable)
especially in
Gods cause, are generally a∣boue
all things reputed most
worthy acceptation: the lesse
then neede I feare (my good
Lord) the receipt of this smal
Volume, containing not so
manie leaues as most excel∣lent
Lessons; nor so manie
lines, as sound assurances of

eternall life. The Tree from
whence this heauenlie fruite
was gathered, may well bee
discerned both by the beau∣tie
and taste: the one not so
commendable in the shewe,
but the other ten times more
comfortable in substaunce.
And, as hee is a sweete soun∣ding
Cimball, or rather a sin∣guler
instrument in Gods
Church, for the propaga∣tion
of his Truth, and spe∣ciall
reliefe of hunger-pining
soules: euen so doo these sea∣uen
Sermons beare witnes of
him: wading so weightely in
Gods cause, as by our Sauiors

absolute Conquest of the di∣uell
in all his Temptations:
our harts are cheered & con∣sciences
prepared, to imitate
so good a guide, whensoeuer
our trialls happen. So fearing
least by needles circumstan∣ces,
I should seeme trouble∣some
to your Honour, when
the goodnes of the woorke
doth plainly declare it self: in
humble duetie I conclude,
praying for your Honours
long health and happines, as
also to encrease the number
that maye bee benefited by
these Sermons.
