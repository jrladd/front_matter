Great Sir,
IT is not any interest, or respect to the Pro∣fessor of the Civil Law, nor envie at, or disobligement from the Practizer of the Municipal Law of this Nation puts me upon this work, but a pure zeal to, and love of Justice (or my own heart deceives me, and in sincerity I have searched it as narrowly as I could) You sit at Sterne, and have laid hand to the Helme: where you find a good and just rule, I hope you will not alter; and where you finde none, or a broken, weake, defective one, I see your desires are strong for Refor∣mation: but you will see, that while you set one thing right, you bring not disorder upon all. Sir, 'tis your wisdome; for as in the natural, so in the politick body, each great alteration is dangerours; Constitutions
 must be altered slowly; the fowler the body, the more need of preparatives before the Purgation comes; yea, it is fit the patient in some measure have some intima∣tion of his condition, that he may more willingly receive his cure, that imagination obstruct not due operation, and that his Physitian gaine his affection, lest prejudice operate more for destruction, then the medicine for preservation; These things are as natu∣ral to Societies, as persons, to the Politick, as natu∣rall body. I have here discovered what of necessity requires a remedy, and that speedily: before a disease hath brought the body low, it will endure heats and colds, and many distempers, alter little or nothing vi∣sibly, but the dregs remaine, and bring the disease by degrees to a height, and then each slight offence is ta∣ken, and strong distempers appeare to danger and ru∣ine. I feare the Politick State labours under a Cri∣tical signe, the disease is growne so strong, it hath such a height, that the utmost skill of a wise Physitian, yea, guided and seconded by the all wise hand, must inter∣vene for Restauration, or danger is threatened. This thing now presented to you was an evident symptome what time would and must work in the same; For, in this Nation of England you have variety of Juris∣dictions, every of which have long bandied against each other: for although the Courts of Law and Equi∣ty were at variance, yet both seemed to joyne against
 the Civilian. Princes saw it, and it may be thought it a piece of policie to keep them at a distance; but it's a certaine rule, the building is weak that is raised upon a loose foundation. There are as demonstrative rules in Government, as in Architecture; and the intention of Societies, Colledes, Fraternities, or what you will, were allowed for unity sake; and that not onely in, and with the Society it self, but each with other mutually; for all make up but as members the body of the Com∣mon-wealth: the Head rules all. I shall not touch up∣on the varieties of Government, all which represent the Head, but must say, the Heads function and duty is to see each member act in his due place, and not suffer them to quarrel each with other to the general prejudice; I regard not who be chief Chancelour, nor Chief-Justice, I seek not Eminencie, but a due of honour or reward for the Judges of Admiralty or Pro∣bates; I would not an enlarging of either jurisdiction to the prejudice of another: but though that part of the Civil Law here used be not onely fitted to the Me∣ridian of England, but all Europe allowes the justice and reason of it; yet let it be the Law of England, and so owned by all English Judges. And though the Chancery be not a Court of Law, in regard of the Courts of Upper-Bench and Common-Pleas, yet while I conceive upon the due Rule, it ought in a legal way to allow nothing, but where the Law would have, that
 is not to go against Law, but to supply where extremi∣ty was ruinous, moderating the severity and rigour of the letter-Law, (and indeed there was a necessity of it in most cases, while an issue upon a point onely was al∣lowed) it is to be accounted the law of England, and let all the Acts of all those Courts be allowed in the Courts of Law, as with each other. The evil is apparent: there is a case proper to equity, state it, and go to a Lawyer for his opinion in Law, he takes Law onely for that called the Common-Law, and puts a man upon suits to his overthrow, for he knowes the Chancery will give relief against it; I know many Lawyers do not so, but they know many do. I would not be tedious: there is happily greater necessity of this then is conceived, and this may content more then other things have dis∣relished. The men to deale with in this case, are wise and prudent, and no doubt will, if consulted, agree to reason. I have onely with as much moderation as I could, presented this to consideration. I have cleared my owne conscience, and remaine
