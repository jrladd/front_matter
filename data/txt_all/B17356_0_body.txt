May it please your Grace,
THE following Papers are bold to presume on your Grace's Patronage and Protection, from the Consideration, that by reason of the high Station in which you move, no Person may claim so just a Title to them, as your self. The whole Piece being designed for the Instruction and Benefit of Soldiers, so far as concerns Morality
and good Manners, I presently conceived your Gra∣ce's Name the fittest, as well as the greatest I could set before it. I should do violence to your Grace's Honour, to endeavour to confine the Elogi∣ums of your great and generous Actions in a Piece of Paper; since the whole Christian World is ac∣quainted with them. Some places to their Cost, and with Fear are sensible of that Courage and Conduct, with which, and the Assistance of Hea∣ven, your Arms have always proved victorious: While others with the greatest Pleasure and Satis∣faction mention your Name, as the happy Instrument of Peace and Safety to them: Especially the Peo∣ple of England, and I among the rest, are bound to acknowledge, that, next to the Mercy of Al∣mighty God, and the auspicious Aid of his present Majesty, we owe the greatest share of the happi∣ness of our late wonderful Deliverance to your Grace, May Heaven still prosper your Grace's Ʋndertak∣ings, for the Defence and Preservation of the true Religion, the Peace and Prosperity of all Christen∣dom, and especially for the Safety, Honour and Welfare of their Majesties, and these Nations for whom you fight, shall always be the Prayer, of
My Lord,
