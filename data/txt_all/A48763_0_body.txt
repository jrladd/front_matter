My Lord,
WHEN I reflected upon the propitious As∣pects of your honourable Countenance, level∣led perpendicularly at your Religious Ob∣server, and upon the growing Profits, day∣ly accruing, from the enjoyment of your Favour, unto me, allowed, through the Impulse of your Pietie, to have rea∣dy access thereto; your Lordship thus adding Honours to a Wit, of purpose it might be improven, and bestowing Fa∣vours, that the Receiver might be made capable to deserve them; I thought it the least part of my Duty to confess the Receipt; and humbly to offer to your Lordship, this home∣ly POEM, not as a competent Retribution, but as an in∣genuous acknowledgement of the Debt Iow you, and speak∣ing Embleme of my duteous Gratitude, since as Cicero say∣eth, Mullum officium referendâ gratiâ magis necessarium. But your Lordship, as Protectour and Favourer of the Muses, may challenge a just Propriety in the Oblation; 'tis but
equitable the Nine, often Watered with the Refreshing Showers of your Bounty, and taken care of, that they might Fructifie, should refound something answerable to that Industry, and by a dutiful acknowledgement of their Pa∣trone, let you taste of the Fruit of your pains; so the well manured and fattened Ground, as't were by a thankful Re∣quital, yields a Fertile and Hope-answering Crop, to the industrious Labourer: Yet, tho the returns of the Muses are far disproportionable to the Provisions, 'tis like, they'l scarcely be welcome to your ordinary Modesty, being un∣willing to be Illuminated with the reflected Beams of your own Vertues, and displeased to have their Curtain drawn, that others may have Admittance to behold you Act; so that I have nothing to make the Fruit of the Muses accep∣table unto you, but this, that they come undesired, hence Livius Writes, dec. 1. lib. 4. Gratia at{que} honos interdum non cupientibus opporiuniora sunt. But if your Lordship be chaf'd to be praised openly, who is to be blamed? Or how was I admitted a Spectatour, when some of your Vertues were Acted privily? Verior famaè domesticis emanat. More∣over 'tis granted, that open Praises, besides the Influence they have on others, in prompting them to Emulation, and to Transcribe the Copy, redound seasonably to the advan∣tage of the Patient, while they Cultivate and make the Ground, thus Prepared and Seasoned, more Pliant and Fertile, inflaming the Mind with a desire to appropriate the Accessions, and deserve (if it were not otherwise due to the praised) the ascribed Character.
Hence Silius,
Arripuit traxit{que} virum fax mentis honestae Gloria—
Others of your Vertues presented unto the view of the world, in behalf of the Republick and your own People clame not unjustly a publick Register; only I do them this injury, that if I had not too ambitiously intrud∣ed upon the Office of Recorder, it might have been per∣formed by a better hand, and they had received a more glo∣rious, and authentick Signature.
'Twas, My Lord, your placable Disposition, and my officious Zeal, which were insinuating Sollicitors, for the Ʋndertaking; 'twas the inestimable Talent of your Fa∣vour, given to, and deposited with me, which cherisht and hatcht this POEM; and nothing will raise the Va∣lue thereof further, so that your Lordship's Favours may seem to be improven, nor will any thing Gratifie the Au∣thour more, then to receive it with your wonted Aspect, whereby the Cruicks will attempt in vain to undermine the Work, while stayed upon the solid Rock of your Heroick Veriues, and seek in vain to disseize the Authour of your Favour, while secured within the Precinct of your Benevolent Thoughts, and indulgent Oversight. And that your Dominions may be enlarged, and your Graces en∣creased and Crown'd with immortal Glory, shall be the Breath which extinguisheth the small Taper of my obse∣quious Poesie, and continueth the course of my serious Oratory, both flowing from
My Lord,
