MOST Renowned (& most worthy to be most re∣nowned) soueraigne Ladie; I presume to offer to your Highnes this first part of the fruit of the litle garden of my slender skill. It hath bene the longer in growing, and is the lesse worthie the gathering, because my ground is barren & too cold for such daintie Italian fruites, being also perhaps ouershaded with trees of some older growth: but the beams of your blessed countenance, vouchsafing to shine on so poore a soile, shal soone disperse all hurtful mists that wold obscure it, and ea∣sily dissolue all (whether they be Mel-dews, or Fel-dews) that would starue this shallow set plant. I desire to be briefe, because I loue to be plaine. VVhatsoeuer I am or can, is your Maiesties. Your graci∣ous fauours haue bene extended in my poore familie euen to the third generation, your bountie to vs and our heirs. VVherefore this (though vnperfect and vnworthie worke) I humbly recommend to that gracious protection, vnder which I enioy all in which I can take ioy. If your Highnesse wil reade it, who dare reiect it? if allow it, who can reproue it? if protect it, what MOMVS barking, or ZOILVS bi∣ting can any way hurt or annoy it? And thus most humbly crauing pardon for this boldnesse, I cease to write, though I will not cease to wish, that your high felicities may neuer cease.
