MY deare Sister, the Dedication of this Poeme can belong to none more fitly, then to your selfe; since (next vnder God) your care of mee in a desperate sicknesse, made me liue to finish it. It is a Translation, and there∣fore farre short of the Originall, the rather because mine:) A Worke not so pleasing for Ladies (being in it selfe lofty, and harsh in the

translation.) It was intended to you, as a Patterne for a piece of Needle-work (I knew you were about;) for which purpose; I per∣swade my selfe, no Poeticall Authour will with more variety furnish you, then Claudian: howsoeuer hee or I faile▪ yet this first labour may seeme as an earnest-penny of my affecti∣on, and to tell you, that all true happinesse in this life, and eternall in the next, is wisht vnto you▪
