Honoured Sir,
HAving no better means to express it, I do ambitiously lay hold of this, to declare, in the face of the World, the great re∣spect I bear you, both in regard of your own worth
and my particular obligati∣ons. Your worth  asure by those talents▪  The Gives of all  has been pleas'd to bestow upon you, in more than an ordinary proportion. The impro∣ving of them is, perchance, no lets to be admired in a person of your ranck and quality. You have given the world a great proof of it by the constant labour & great charge you have put your self to, for instructing men, the best way (by laying examples before them) how to become Saints. And, as you have in this shewed, first, the great esteem your self have
of sanctity, so have you also by communicating your la∣bours to others; given them who participae o them an excellent lesson to learn by, how to be good to them∣selves and others also. If mo∣ved by this example of yours, I have endeavourd somthing for the publick good, I hope you will allow me the free∣dom, to present these my first labours to you, by whose conversation, in my first beginnings, I must own, as part of my obligation to you, that I learned a good share both of mine own lan∣guage, and of that of my Authour, of which, as well
as of the Spanish, you have shewed your self to have more than an ordinary com∣pehension. As for the Work it self; I hope of will not be unwelcome to you, as being sorfull (the little part I have in it emboldens me to say so) both of reason and civility, as will render it much suit∣ing with your humour, who are particularly remarkable for them both. The latter, at least, I hope, will incline you to give it a favourable entertainment, and to accept of this small expression of the respects of
Honoured Sir,
