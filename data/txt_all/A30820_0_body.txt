My Lord,
THis Poem, though
compos'd in a
Peak-like coun∣try,
has yet no cause to

be proud of its high birth,
unless more worthy it
were of your Lordships
perusal, more suitable to
the gallantry of your flou∣rishing
condition. Yet as
the ancient Muses deligh∣ted
to climb Mountains,
Parnassus Helicon, and
others; so has mine been
moved with a pleasing am∣bition
to ascend to the emi∣nency
of your presence. It
was your servant and my
Kinsman, Mr. Henry
Wright, that occasional∣ly

rais'd her to this bold∣ness,
whilst he highly
commended your most
hopeful endowments, and
mentioned (with much
honour) your singular
love to learning. It is
(I confess) a superfluous
service to present to your
Lordship a phansied pat∣tern,
you being really
conformed to your tru∣ly-noble
Father, as he
to more ancient Wor∣thies
of your Family,
that heightned their Ho∣nours

by heaping bene∣fits
on their countrey,
and made their houses
seem palaces by their
royal hospitality. I am
therfore in good hope that
you will be pleased to
entertain this Heroical
Lover; and that as the
rising Sunne (that celesti∣al
Archer) seem'd to
shoot life into Memnons
statue: so your affulgent
favour will quicken this
dull composure, and dis∣cloud
withal the Authors

forehead, that he may
more clearly exhibite him∣self.
