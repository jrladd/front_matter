May it please your Majesty,
TO give me leave most humbly to offer unto your Ma∣jesties perusal, a small Posthumus work, of a poor The∣atine of the Order of Servi newly taught English, who Lived and Dyed in the Communion of the Church of Rome, yet happily as worthily Great, as that or any other Age, either before or since hath produced. Great, for universal Learning, for wisdom in Councils, for discerning right reason from Sophistical-School-quirks, for faithfully recording Antient Monuments and customs of the Church, so that every one that reads them may safely swear, not only to the truth, but to the Im∣partiality of them, being written without respect to this or that Church in particular, but to Holy Church in general. Great, for sound∣ness of Judgment, for admirable dexterity in summing up intricate, wrangling and prevaricating disputes, into short perpicuous and pi∣thy Results: Great also, for Holyness of Life and Conversation, contentedness and moderation of desires, not seeking high things for himself (thereby imitating Christ himself, who when the Multitude would have taken him by force to make him a King, withdrew himself into a Mountain alone) never altering his Habit, Condition, or Cell, though esteemed the very Oracle of Venice; who stoutly, yet with great Modesty and Reverence towards his Holy Father the Pope, defended the just Rights of that Wise Republick, against his Holiness and all his Conclave, to his eternal Honour, confounding all the wits (which were not few) of that Age by the effort of invincible reason, fairly appealing to the Judgment of all the world by his Pen, and at the end and close of the Accommodation, refusing to give Rome it self the satisfaction, though but of words, and esteemed as insignificant the Popes Breve offered for taking away his Censures and his Instrument
of Absolution, and the Instrument for the delivery of the Prisoners, and the decree of the Senate for the Restitution of the Religious, &c. All wyles and tricks of the Court of Rome granted (Covertly and with design to Cajole) unto the Cardinal of Joyeuse, which they did not dare to divulge in formal Copies, but only dispersed under-hand some Abridgements of them to Amuse, and cheat the World. He so Confounded the Jesuits that that State so Solemnly Banished them their Dominions, that they were never to be re-admitted, nor the Decree revoked, unless the whole Process against them were first read in full Senate, whereof five parts of six should give Suf∣frage for their Revocation: And who, though by the Constitution of that Republick, as an Ecclesiastick could not formally sit in their Council, yet that State had that Esteem for him, that they so far dispensed, as that he was permitted to sit therein behind a Curtain, that he might be Master of all their Debates and Advisoes, and in due time and place give his own. I might add much more concern∣ing the Articles of his Faith, whereof there are 54 at the end of his Hi∣story of the Inquisition, Published in Latin by Andreas Colvius, Printed at Roterdam 1651, where he is Stiled Splendor & Ornamentum Orbis, the Glory and Ornament of the World, but I forbear, lest under pretence of an Epistle Dedicatory, I should seem to write an Epitaph. If I have too far transgress'd already, I can only plead for my excuse, that he being rested from his Labours, it is but just, that his good works should follow him, and his praises celebrated.
This very work of his, though small in Bulk, yet very rich in Cargo, not only for the Excellency, but for the Curiosity and Rarity thereof, there being nothing Extant so succint, particular and exact, for full, perfect and distinct information comparable to it, nor so methodically declaring their genuine History and pedigree of their first Institutions and right uses, the Alternate Gradations of their rise, growth and de∣viations by which they degenerated into Abuses, and seems as if it were Calculated for the very Nursing Fathers of Holy Church, of which your Majesty being the great defender, the Dedication hereof hath so just a pretence to your favourable Acceptance and perusal, that it would be injurious to your Majesty to doubt thereof. I pray God guide your Majesty with his Councils, while you Live, and afterwards receive you to Glory. So Prayeth
