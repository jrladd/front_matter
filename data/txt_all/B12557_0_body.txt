A Twofold necessity (Honourable and my very good Lord) inforceth me to offer to the commmon view this my Two∣fold Tribute. The one is the desire I haue of the publike good of that Church and Country wherein I haue hither to had my being and biding: the other is the Deuoire I beare to the priuate good of such as haue sometimes desired, and somewhile expected, that I should farther both gratifie and satisfie them with some thing of that Argument, wherein I haue formerly and somewhat plentifully la∣boured.
To the which scope forsomuch as the latter, but the greater part of this my little (but laborious worke) doth wholly tend, both hauing one Author, and one Argu∣ment, & this being but as an Accession to the first buil∣ding, and a new Supplie to an old Charge, I haue much desired that both might haue but one Patrone: assured
 that passing vnder your Lordships honourable name, as the other hath beene, so this will be shielded from the iniu∣rie and the enuie both of the couetous and contentious: and vouchsafed with men of godly knowledge and sound Iudgement the better acceptation, and with men of good place and great authoritie, the grauer consideration. Which fauour that your Lordship will, of your great Loue to learning, and good liking to all such indeuours, as tend to the glory of God and benefit of his Church, the Honour of the Kings most excellent Maiesty and bettering of his subiects, easily vouchsafe mee nothing doubting at all: commending these my second labours also; to your Lord∣ships protection, and your good Lordship to the protection of the Lord of Heauen and earth, I doe humbly rest,
