ITs true My Lord, that to a per∣son as Numa Pompilius, who ho∣noured the Church, a Treatise concerning Divine matters were most proper. To one as Marcellus who pitied those that were vanquisht of compassion. To one as Caesar, (who forgave his Enemies) of Cle∣mency. To one as Octavian (be∣loved of the People) of true Love. To one as Alexander (who gave to all) of Liberality. To one, as Hector (Valiant in War) of Heroick feats. And what more proper to one as Hercules of Thebes, Ulysses of Greece, Phyrrhus King of Epirots, excellent in the invention of Warlike Works, Catulus, Titus, Marcus, Aurelius, Croe∣sus

King of Lydia, (a just man) true, magnanimous, tender, couragious, a Mecenas to wise men, and the great enemy of those that were Ig∣norant. But that malicious persons who cannot endure any but them∣selves, should passe for persons en∣dued with some usefull quality; I do make therefore bold to present, though a Treatise concerning Me∣chanicks to your Graces view, with the Humble Tender of the respects due to a second Perseus, who next to the Almighties arm hath delivered this Albion Andromeda from a Mon∣ster, which deprived me also from a publick imployment, during the space of seaventeen years.
