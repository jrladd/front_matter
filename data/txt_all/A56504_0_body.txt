Honoured Sir,
I Here presume to lay before you a small Treatise, the Subject of which is overgrown with Years, and perfectly obliviated; so that it will seem to this Age to be a real Novelty, and a product but of yesterday: And this too among those who think themselves Masters of the Mystery; because they have aban∣don'd the Old Doctrine, and set up a new-fan∣gl'd one of their own, remote from the Old both in its Principles and Practice, and no ways agreeable to the Doctrine of Ptolemy.
I need not use Arguments with you to per∣swade a Belief of Starry Influence; you have both seen and felt it, nay, and foreseen it too;

as well in the late times of Iniquity, when it was a Crime to be Just, or to appear an English∣man; as since our happy Restoration by the successful Arms and Conduct of His present Ma∣jesty, to whom we owe our Safety both for Laws and Religion, both which were ruin'd and torn from us by Force.
Your former Obligations lead me to beg your Patronage of this Treatise; a Discourse out of the Common way, and therefore more subject to Censure and Envy: And though I am consci∣ous of the meanness of my Performance therein; yet I am the more bold to offer the Protection of it to you, and hope you will be the less dis∣pleased, when you find it already protected by an Honourable Gentleman, and my Noble Friend, Sir Edward Dering; who having much approv'd the Scope and Design of the Book (of which he is a very Able and Sufficient Judge) was plea∣sed in the interim to write the following Letter to me upon that Subject, for my Encourage∣ment; wherein he hath learnedly vindicated the Immortal Ptolemy, and set his Seal to that Old Do∣ctrine of the true and genuine Hileg, delivered only by him so many hunded years ago, the thing which I here chiefly contend for. Which Epistle being too worthy and noble a thing to

be buri'd in my Study, I made bold to impor∣tune Sir Edward Dering to permit me to publish it; which at last, referring it to my Discretion, to do as I thought fit, I was proud to honour my Treatise, by prefixing so ingenious a Di∣scourse from a Learned Hand before it.
Thus Sir, with your Favour also, I account my self and my poor Endeavours doubly pro∣tected, and shall not fear the snarling of any Ignorant Readers, although they bestow the like Railing Epithets on me, as they do on the Great and Learned Ptolemy, the chief and only Talent indeed in which they are famous.
I hope the owning these Sheets will no ways tend to your Dishonour, because they come from so unlearned a Pen as mine. The thing is well designed, and I intend it for the Service of the present, as well as the succeeding Ages, though I despair to find Entertainment with the present, they being wedded to a Method as a man to a false Religion, with which he will by no means part, tho' for his Safety and Advan∣tage both here and hereafter.
Sir, I beg your good Opinion of what I have done; and though it may come short of what it ought to be, and you may justly ex∣pect;

Yet attribute that not to my want of Goo-will, but Abilities, and always be pleased to give both Book and Author your good Word; a Favour sufficient, and what I can ne∣ver pretend to deserve; yet shall always endea∣vour to the utmost to shew I am,
