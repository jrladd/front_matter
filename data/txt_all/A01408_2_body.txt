WHen as I had for your sakes (dere brethren) fi∣nished my booke intitu∣led the Institution of a Chirurgian, and thought to haue proceded no further touching the practike part, but minding to send you to Guido de Cauliaco, Brunus, Lan∣franke, Vigo, or some other of our Au∣thours in Chirurgerie, whiche doe thereof intreate: I could fynde no one that might answere my desire. For ei∣ther they wryte in the tonge whiche the most of you vnderstand not, either vse they corrupt and barbarous na∣mes of sicknes and medicines, or they be to tedious & longe. or ells to concise and brief. Furthermore they welney al are so ful of errours, that they are only
 for the learned to read, who can dis∣cerne betwixte trueth and falsnesse. Wherefore knowinge your desyre to learne, and seing the want of such Au∣thours as you should profite by: I la∣menting the case, and tendering your wealth haue taken the paynes to com¦pile you this briefe Treatise, called hereof an Enchiridion, in whiche you shal fynde the methode and way how to cure all wounds both in the similer and instrumentall parts. Also how to vnite and heale fractured members, and to reduce and repose againe into their wonted and naturall place suche bones as be dislocated. Diuers secret and perfect experiments I haue made open vnto you. Wherefore be bolde to worke after the doctrine set oute in this booke, and take these my labours as a pledge of my good wyll towards you all: and loue me styll as you haue begonne.
At my house in London the .ii. of August. 1563.
