May it please Your Majesties and Lordships:
FOod, Drink, and Rayment, are the prime Requisites of Humane Life. Of Drinks, the Juice of the Grape is esteemed the most Generous; But since Providence has not Indulged every Nation with That of its own Growth; and for that, tho' the more Southern Countrys Enjoy it, yet the more Northern that are without it, do by the Cold∣ness of their Climate most stand in need of strong Drinks; And since Ale and Beer is too Cloudy and heavy; and to furnish themselves with Wine, they exhaust yearly a great part of their Treasure and Native Commodities; I thought, if I could find out and inform that part of the World, how to prepare a sort of Liquor which might Answer all the Ends and Advantages of Wine, and yet be of Your own Countries Production, and afforded much Cheaper, I might Deserve well of Your Majesties and Lordships, and all Your Subjects, both now and to Posterity.
That which nearest approaches the Nature of Wine, is the Juice of Apples, Wildings, Pears and other Fruits, (commonly called Cyder, Perry, Currant, Cherry and Gooseberry-Wine &c.) And with all or some of these, Your respective Territo∣ries are, or may be plentifully Furnisht. The Defect hitherto has been, First, That few have applyed themselves to making of Cyder. Secondly, Much fewer are Those that know how to make even tollerable common simple Cyder. Thirdly, Their Cyder who made it Best, Falls short of the Goodness of Wine in strength and Delicacy; and besides, by reason of its Coldness and Crudities, was apt to Ge∣nerate Wind, and other Distempers, and so proved not so wholsome to the Body.
For all these Inconveniences, Here is found a proper and certain Remedy; The SECRET is brought home to Your Doors, and in the Following Papers spread before You; So that hencefoth, after a little Industry, You need not (for General use) be beholden to any Forreiner, for their Wines but Furnish Your selves as

well, and abundantly Cheaper, at Home, and Drink for Your own Healhs, without Despising the Discoverer in Variety of Liquors of Your own Production, altogether as good and Satisfactory.
How this Overture may be Resented, I am not Prophet enough to fore-see; The Incredulity of our King Henry the Seventh (tho justly numbred amongst the wi∣sest Monarchs of that Age) is reported by some Authors to have cost him the Im∣mense loss of the West-Indian Treasures, which have since Enricht all the Kings, Princes, and States of Europe: And even Ferdinand of Castile was behold∣ing to the Importunities of his Lady Isabella, for accepting that proffer'd Prize, and the Discovery of that New World, from a despised Columbus. And how∣ever this Present thing, or my self may be Censur'd or Contemn'd at first; yet without the least doubt I believe, that a time will come, wherein all or most of the Kings, Princes, and States, or at least their Subjects, in those Nations that have no Wines of their own, may have Cause to Rejoice either in the Use or Advan∣tage, which themselves may make thereof; And that too, without Raising any Burthensome Taxes, or putting their Subjects to heavy Charges.
For as it must undoubtedly be of great Profit to all Nations that are unfurnisht with Wine of their own Production, especially, those whose Soil will afford the Materials (In which respect I forget not the Kingdom of Poland, to whom I made my Endeavours to transmit my Proposals, but by reason of the remote di∣stance and small Entercourse from hence thither, I could not gain an Opportunity; However I cannot but Recommend it as a thing of great Moment to that Renouned King and Nation, their Countrey being as proper for it as any in the World) so as for Climates which yield not Fruits Necessary, they will yet however Fare much the bet∣ter too, since less VVines being spent in those Nations that used to take off the greatest Quantities (viz. two or three Millions worth of Wines and Brandy's per Annum) The French, &c. must then be necessiated to force a Trade, by selling them much Cheaper, than ever they would have done, were it not for this Discovery.
Ʋpon the whole matter, as Your most Excellent Majesties, and Your renowned Lordships, have by Your several Letters Patents, Contracts, and Resolutions, given me Assurances of a Proportionate Reward and Encouragement; If upon the Discovery, the thing should prove Feazible, and be Accepted, or Suffered to be practised in Your several Dominions, so Relying upon Your Royal and Honou∣rable VVords (than which nothing here below can be more Sacred) to Your Justice Wisdom, and Goodness, I Humbly referr my self, and these my well-intended Endeavours, Remaining
To Your Majesty my dread Soveraign, a most Humble Loyal and Faith∣fully Devoted Subject. And to you the other most Excellent Kings, and Honourable Lords,
