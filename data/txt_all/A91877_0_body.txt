THE passing of those long expected Resolves of this High Court for the Englishing both of our Lawes and Proceedings in all Courts of Justice; for abrogating the so call'd, Court-hand, which to most People did no∣thing differ from exorcisticall Characters, save that the former was truly mischievous to them, the latter for the most part but imaginary; For nullifying superfluous Offices, & retrenching unnecessary Fees; for the expediting of Causes, and pursuing certaine directions concerning Ju∣ries, hath emboldned me to present unto your Wisdom these few considerations hereunto annexed: for which, and what else I have transgressed in the like kind, I shall only vse this short Apologie; That, as I have to some been known to cast in my little mite, concerning many, if not most matters of pub∣lick debate, not so much out of confidence of my own strength, as sincerity of heart, and for provoking others of bet∣ter abilities to improve them: so in this, towards the Refor∣mation of our Lawes and Law-proceedings, which if not speedily brought about, may like enough, take root again, and settle firmer upon their old corrupt foundation, which must necessarily contract such farther rottenness & festering, as wil at first infect, & afterwards, too soon, make void and anni∣hilate all those Glorious Liberties and Discoveries, which

wee have attained to with the charge of so much Blood and Treasure, for redeeming them out of the jaws of Superstiti∣on & Tyranny: may You then but be prevailed upon spee∣dily to secure what We have so dearly paid for: We must in∣fallibly back again into our wonted bondage (which on such as have had their eyes opened, would fall more grievous) un∣lesse the whole Mysterie of the Judiciary faculty, and of all those that relate unto it, be fully discovered, and set at rights.
I beseech You consider, They are an Active generation, so that if well regulated, the Nation may be as happy in them, as otherwise We must be again more miserable.
May You then please to let it be enquired into; Whether the Multiplicity of Courts of Justice do not caus a more mis∣chievous confusion in the World, than the Babilonian of Languages? That of Babel doth only estrang Nations to one another; but this variety of Courts of Justice in any Land or Nation, perplexes and confounds the People thereof among themselves; The proceedings in them are so various, as that it is above any one mans ability and strength to be experien∣ced in more than one of them: So many severall Courts, so many severall hard Mysteries or Trades, above one where∣of, no man though of the ablest parts, can be well skill'd in or practiced: And from henc proceeds it in part, that Law∣suits becom both more lasting and chargeable: Particularly, to what purpose served the Kings Prerogative Court of Exche∣quer, one of the most eminent badges of Conquest and Tyran∣ny? Surely all Courts should be the Common-wealths in ge∣nerall, and every mans in particular: Justice should not know any distinction of persons, but be still one and the same in all Courts alike, whether as touching the letter of the Law, or Equity: But for sooth, they were all called the Kings Courts a∣like; And indeed we had little but what was our Kings, Wee had nothing of our own; so gracious were they, and so mise∣rable

have we been: But our Kings boar sway enough in all o∣ther Courts at Westminster, they needed not have had a pe∣culiar Court of their own to doe Injustice.
Besides; Our Lawes of themselves are so numerous and in∣tricate, as that it is not possible to know them all, much lesse keep them in memory, or avoyd the being entangled by them, and injured by Law: Nay, I am afraid it may be found, that never such Jugling, if not very cheating, was consistent with the rules of any Faculty, as of this I speak, and is at present practiced in England: How els comes it to passe that a man may dwell in Westminster-Hall, and yet be sued unto an Out∣lary before he know of it? How comes it els to pass that an Ex∣ecutor may be forced to pay as long as he hath Assetts, and yet afterwards be forced to pay the same sums over again, because hee could not keep himself from being forced to pay them away before? In brief, how comes it els to pass that a Debitor may keep his Creditor in prison untill he be compelled to give him a discharg, or yeeld to whatsoever he desires? I only wish that some honest publique spirited Lawyer who throughly un∣derstands the various Meanders, Quirks and subtilties of this over-powring Faculty, would anatomize, and lay open un∣to the Nation, how easily it is for the very best Lawes wee have to be evaded and frustrated, and the whole formality and proceedings to be avoyded and deluded by legall fallacies and tricks.
I am confident our whole body of Lawes, even in their ori∣ginall constitution, will be found to be so purely the Offspring of Oppression, and Oppressors Creatures, and in themselves so weak and fruitlesse, as to the estating and continuing of a Na∣tion in Peace, plenty, and Contentation, that the Law, or ra∣ther custome of the Turks, is to be preferred before it, where he that will give most, shall be sure to have the right determined on his side; only, because the wronged party is quickly out of

pain, and in a short time knowes what he has to trust to:
But for our own Lawes, which some notwithstanding pre∣fer before all the world's, because they never well understood their own, much less those of other Countries, though corrupt enough in most; They are such a forraginous peece of Intrica∣cies, such a vanity to becom a Rule unto so famous a Nation; such a Nose of wax, lyable to be formed any way for the vex∣ation of a People; as that if the very memory thereof, and the Formalities of their proceedings were quite extinct, never to present themselves again unto our Imaginations, and thereby the Nation forced to seek out both new Lawes and Forms; wee could not happen upon so bad again; Nay, wee were likelier to light upon far better than any Nation enjoyes at present; be∣cause well neer all Nations, though some more, some less, lye under oppression, and cannot procure to themselves, such as they desire, nor the equall administration of those they have.
I did not intend to have been so tedious, & therefore hum∣bly crave leave to insert a word concerning our Statutes a∣gainst Maintenance & Champarty, whereby the purchasing of Titles from persons not in possession, have been so speciously prohibited, as the only way to prevent disquieting, vexing, op∣pressing, and finall disinheriting of the true Proprietors: Sure∣ly We may find the quite contrary effect to have ensued here∣upon, and poor People by force of these Statutes been necessita∣ted to lose their titles, because they might not gratifie such as would have been willing to furnish them with moneys to pro∣secute and recover their Rights.
What good effect have we seen at any time to poor People su∣ing in forma pauperis? If the highest vyer can protract, & sway Causes as they please, against others of moderate, though inferiour estates and friends unto themselves; cer∣tainly no crums of relief, much less of dispatch, will be suffe∣red to be cast away to Paupers.

May we but have speedy justice at home in our own Coun∣ties, and large charges to such as shall be found unduly sued; we need not prohibit poor People, to sell or give away one halfe of their right, for recovering of the other: Men will look be∣fore they leap, and consider well before they adventure upon bad titles, or disturb any man in possession, unless they see suf∣ficient evidence to bear them out therein: It would be a hun∣dred fold better for the Nation, even under these Laws we live at present, so far forth to repeal those Statutes concerning Mayntenance & Champarty, and render all men in possession lyable to have their Titles questioned; than to leave poor Peo∣ple remediles; In regard such poor People thus oppressed are a∣bove a hundred for one, who by such repeal would be in dan∣ger to be unduly molested.
But if the Reformation of the Lawes seem great and diffi∣cult, and by so much longer before it can be brought about: We may notwithstanding be happy in due time, If it be but seri∣ously begun to be set upon at present; and in the Interim, with less disadvantage patiently expect the compleating thereof, If the County Register of Conveyances mentioned in the same dayes Resolves, together with another Register of Bonds and Bills of debt, with their Irrevocable assignablenesse to all in∣tents and purposes, (whereof I have a modell not exceeding one sheet of paper, nor requiring many hours debate, ready to be produced whensoever this High Court shall be pleased to re∣fer it unto a Committee, to be proceeded on) were forth-with established: Both the said Registers carrying in themselves a capacity to abbreviat & prevent the greatest part of all Law∣suits and Cavils; and the latter not only to multiply the stock of the Nation, which at present is at so low an ebb, would ex∣ceedingly facilitate and enlarg Trade and Navigation.
But lest I should be accounted unworthy, or unadvised to in∣termeddle in this great affair, wch besides it's being obnoxious

to other objections, might perhaps at first appearance be thought very dammageable unto the conscientious learned Judges and Counsellors: In case this High Court in their deep Wisdom shall think of a Reformation, whether according to this little modell in all humility propounded, or any other, which, I wish might be of a hundred fold more advantage un∣to this Nation; It is in Your power to constitute and assign such worthy Judges and Counsellors in every County through∣out the Land, with the very same stipends, or greater than they enjoy at present; Praemio & paena floret Respublica: It were better to be profuse in rewarding persons of desert in what kind soever, than to be short therein.
And since the pittance is so smal, which can any wayes be∣fall me in this Common-wealth's prosperity, I hope I shall be thought free from all self-Interests, and only to have engaged my selfe in matters of this high Nature out of a Publique spi∣ritedness, and to make the best Improvement of my only ta∣lent how small soever, to the best advantage of this Nation wherein Providence hath cast me.
There now remayns only this humble Motion, That the High Court of Parliament if in their deep Wisdoms They see caus, vouchsafe to refer the consideration of this little Paper unto the Committee mentioned in the said Resolves, for whose happy proceedings thereupon, or otherwise, in pursuance of the said Resolves,
This Propounder and the whole Nation will be bound to pray, &c.
