SIR,
WOrkes of this Nature, may fitly be compared to small and narrow ri∣volets, that at first de∣rive themselves to grea∣ter Rivers, and afterwards are dis∣charged into the maine Ocean: So Poesie rising from obscure and almost unminded beginnings, hath often advanc'd it Selfe, even to the thrones of Princes: witnesse that ever-living Worke of renowned Virgil, so

much admired and favoured by magnificent Augustus: Nor can I much wonder that great men, and those of Excellent parts, have so often preferred Poesie, it being in∣deed, the sweetest and best speaker of all Noble Actions.
Nor were they wont in ancient times to preferre those their Workes to them they best knew, but vnto some Person highly endued with Vallour, Learning, and such other Graces, as render one man farre more Excellent then many others. And this, I hope, may excuse my boldnesse, in this Dedication, being so much a stranger to your Wor∣ships knowledge, onely presuming upon your Noble temper, ever apt to cherish well-affected studies. Likewise, this peice seemeth to have

a more speciall kind of relation to your Selfe, more then to many o∣thers, it being an Exact and perfect patterne of a truly Noble and War∣lick Christian.
When it first appeared upon the Stage, it went off with Applause and favour, and my hope is, it may yeild your Worship, as much con∣tent, as my selfe can wish, who ever rest to be commaunded by your worship,
