THe chiefe and principal thing (Right Honou∣rable) apper∣taining to eue∣rie
 worthy personage (which thing it is good to see that your Honour doth well con∣sider) is to walke in the Gar∣den of humility, whereto the igh  direct way is to passe by  of Vertue, whose  is ancho∣red and lincked to the feare and loue of GOD. For as by the one  couered the multi∣tude of sinnes, so by the other is obtained blessednesse, wise∣dome, and knowledge. Da∣uid that noble King and Prophet, after hee had long trauelled and passed through the Gate of Vertue, entred the faire and pleasant Gar∣den of Humilitie; and his walking and continuance
 therein so much pleased God, that hee saide of him by the mouth of his Prophet: I will set vp thy seede after thee which shall proceede out of thy bodie. And now knowing (most Honourable Knight) the great loue and affection which your Honor euer hath and doth beare to vertue and godlinesse, I was thereby moued the more bold∣lie, after I had gathered to∣gether this small-handfull of flowers (named The Soules Alarum-Bel) to dedicate the same to your Honour, as the fruite of my labours, no∣thing doubting but that they shall bee acceptable vnto you, and shelter themselues vnder
 your fauourable & sure pro∣tection. And I thought good to set forth a Treatise of this nature, the rather because meditation is the key that o∣peneth to vertue and all god∣lines, for the encrease of ver∣tue and godly liuing, leading all them that follow it to tread in the right and true pathe, which our Sauiur Christ hath prescribed vnto vs in his holy Gospell. I most humbly beseeche your Ho∣nour to accept it as my good will towards you; a shew of thankefulnesse, but no satis∣faction for the great fauours and kindnesses which my friends and I haue receiued from your Honour.

So crauing your honoura∣ble patience & pardon here∣in, if any thing haue escaped me for want of knowledge or learning, I shall (according to my bounden dutte) call dailie with my most humble and heartie prayers to Almighty GOD, that hee will finish that good which hee hath be∣gunne in you; praying also for the prosperous preseruation of your health and posteritie long to liue in honour, ioy, and felicitie in this World, and to send you in the World to come a ioyfull Resurrection.
Amen.
