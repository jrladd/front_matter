My Lord,
SEe here a piece of Babarism, which hath lain so long both as an in∣jurie, and a dishonour to our Nation brought again to light, by which, as we may compare the difference of these blessed times, from those unhappie ones when this was acted and passed by; so we must needs remember to bless God
for that victorious hand of yours, which hath in so great a manner led us a good part out of the Wilderness; And therefore I thought it but a piece of publick gratitude, (besides private) to throw it as your Excellencies feet; whose great soul, I presume, will rather descend to look into this business, wherein your Countrey is so highly concerned, that in respect a∣broad you have been a fierie wall about her, so at home you are become her great In∣telligence, and guid those great motions of her peace and securitie: Which great work, as I hope God will grant you to see finished, so wish I you may live long to enjoy the fruits and comfort of it.
