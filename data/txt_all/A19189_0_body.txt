THough I liue a farre off from you, yet God knowes that I haue not beene vnmindfull of you in my daily prayers to God, which was the best good which I could doe vnto you. And when I heard that God did beginne to shine in loue vpon the City againe, God knowes that I was not vnmindefull to bee thankfull to him that is the sole Author of it. I thought not that e∣nough: therefore as before I had spent many dayes in fasting, and prayer, for our selues in body; so did I re∣solue
 (hauing that blessed liberty) to spende one day in fasting, prayer, and thanksgiuing for you: what good it wrought vpon my owne people and those of your body who heard me, I am not worthy to know: but what good I aymed at my conscience is priuy to, & what my desire is to do more. I consider how louingly I haue beene in∣tertained of many of you when I was assistant to a Reue∣rend Diuine amongst you, who is now with God. I con∣siderMaster Haiward of Wool-Church. that I haue many brethren, sisters, and kins-folke, who haue fellowship with you, & whose soules I tenderly affect. In which respects though (as it is wittily said) some more Learned, and godly men are Fathers, Nur∣ses and murtherers to their owne Children, in beget∣ting, kissing, and burying the fruits of their owne braines, yet am I still aduenturous to shew others what God hath giuen me (vnworthy wretch) to bring forth, and to say vnto you; Behold I and my child. I haue not trimmed it with ornaments and laces of Aegypt, nor sweetned it with the Frankincense and myrrhe of the Christian Synagouge: but as God hath sent it with the lawe of God written in the fore-head, hands, feete and heart of it, so send I it vnto you, desiring God to make this seruice acceptable and profitable vnto you: And so I rest,

From my Studie this fifteenth of Nouember 1625.
