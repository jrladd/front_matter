HAving been much troubled, even to restâˆ£lesness in my Thoughts, about the tender and dangerous Distractions of these Times, I have often and earnestly besought Almighty God in my Prayers that he would assist me with his Spirit, that I might honestly set my self to seek the Truth, so seeking that I might find it, and finding it, may chearfully embrace it, and constantly cleave unto it, in what Case or Danger soever I should find it.
To this end I tasked my self to the saddest and severest Meditations my weak Body and Intellectuals could undergo, which being, I trust by the guidance of God, resolved into these ensuing Hypotheses, I commit to your judicious and most impartial Censure, being not so fond of mine own fancies, but that I can indure to see them stript stark naked; and if they prove not the Issues of Truth, to disinherit them from ever having farther possession of my Thought: I see not many things, and hear not all, living so remote from any Town where the Tide of Books and Reports flows in; some Pamphlets there are walking about with as much confidence, and finding as good
entertainment as Truth it self needeth, and with a great deal of less Modesty than it useth to do Pleas, Appeals, Reasons, &c. which, beg the Question I look they should prove, left me more unsatisfied (rather) than they found me: I have hitherto (perhaps through fondness) more contentment from these Conceptions of mine own, which I intreat you to examin with all Faithfulness and Severity, as knowing you cannot do your self or me greater injury than to flatter me in falshood, who am come (praised be God) so far towards Wisdom, as heartily to thank him who rebukes me in Love, and lovingly to thank him who refutes me with Reason.
