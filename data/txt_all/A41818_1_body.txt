BElieve me, Friend, when t'other night you lent
Your Plays to read, I thought my time well spent:
For, though I would not play my time away,
I would pass time to read a well-penn'd Play.
And such are yours, in which all things so fit
Th'Decorum both of Iudgement, and of Wit;
That, though unposted yet, nor with applause
Or acted here or there, the Comick Laws
Are in them so well kept, that hence you may,
Were they all lost, pick plat-forms for a Play.
Nor need you doubt, in this our Comick Age,
Welcome acceptance for them from the Stage:
For, if 'tis true the Proverb doth express,
That . He's best Prophet, who doth nearest guess,
This I'le dare to foretell, although no Sear,
That Thorny-Abbey will out-date King LEAR;
And Captain HOG his old Trade would give o're,
When his Play's acted, might he keep the Door;
And who in GRIM spyes not both wit and pains,
Needs Robin's flayl to beat it into's brains.
But if in wbs so fine the lists chance shrink,
When you compare themâ–ª somewhat; or you think.
That I Hyperbolize more then is fit:
Excuse my Iudgement, and accuse my Wit.
