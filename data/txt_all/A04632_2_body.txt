THou art a bountifull, and braue spring: and waterest all the noâˆ£ble plants of this Iland. In thee, the whole Kingdome dresseth it selfe, and is ambitious to vse thee as her glasse. Beware, then, thou render mens figures truly, and teach them no lesse to bate their deformities, then to loue their formes: For, to grace, there should come reuerence; and no man can call that louely, which is not also venerable. It is not pould'ring, perfuming, and euery day smelling of the taylor, that conuerteth to a beautiful obiect: but a mind, shining through any sute, which needes no false light either of riches, or honors to helpe it. Such shalt thou find some here, euen in the raigne of CYNTHIA (a CRITES, and an ARETE.) Now, vnder thy PHOEBVS, it will be thy prouince to make more: Except thou desirest to haue thy source mixe with the Spring of selfe-Loue, and so wilt draw vpon thee as welcome a discouery of thy dayes, as was then made of her nights.
