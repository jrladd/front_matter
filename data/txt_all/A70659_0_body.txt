Great Sir,
EXpectation flattering my hopes, shortned the way from London hither: but now the Servants slow aspects, & reserv'd behaviours, might scare young modesty, from ventu∣ring to approach. Yet I excuse the smal address, they suffer to your noble per∣son, by saying, they know the worth of it: therefore make it not cheap to every Eie. And in supposing all Strangers to be Sutors, they proclaim your aboad the very Seat, where all Justice doth inhabit. Here I arrive empty of mer∣cenary Thoughts; for Duty hath pre∣fer'd

me to such a strange ambition, that I do even give unto your gracious self Nim, and Bung his man, both born to attend your Lordships mirth. It was made, transcrib'd, and bound up yours, nay I was so zealous in curiosi∣ty, that but this Copy (besides the Ori∣ginal) is extant Had not learned friends (after perusal) urg'd me to this bold∣nesse, Nim had known humility, who now discovers the inside of them▪ who most envy your Graces high, deserved happiness, whilst every jeast proves by interpretation serious, though he nominates none. If in the least kind he degenerate from my chast intents, tear it▪ into a form more displeasing then your Anger▪ All my present sute is, your Grace would deigne to read it▪ which when confirm'd by promise, I shall re∣turn to▪ London, and publish my suc∣cesse.
