SIR,
WEre it not an unpardonable transgression of Decorum to insinuate any thing I present to you on common inducements, I should (which most justly I might) have used the ordi∣nary style of Dedications, and said, The Vast Obligations, which you have laid upon me, require some publick testimony of gra¦titude, and I could never evidence it more proper∣ly than by making that yours, of which you were an Auditour in so publick a capacity.
But I had rather the world should know I am ignorant where to find a surer Patron for a Dis∣course of this subject; and that your real Zeal and fidelity to the Ecclesiastical laws, order and present constitution, renders you, first a refuge of the constant and faithful sons of the Church, and then of whatsoever speaks such faithfulness. Where therefore I am assured of so true affection to the
 Clergy, I cannot doubt but their Miseries will find asie Pity, and their Mournings Patronage: And his is the true reason which gives you the Trouble of this Address.
If there should be any expression in what I hastily meditated (as my necessary imploiments at present enforce) which should disgust any, and create wonder that your name should be used to authorise ught so harsh, you may be pleased to answer (what s most true) That you knew neither of the Printing nor Dedication hereof till the sight of it surprized you; That I am a man presumptuous upon my friends, and had the boldness to reckon you one of the chief; That I did this (for what you know) on mine own head, and, possibly, carried away herein by an uncontroleable ambition of publishing my self happy that I can pretend to be,
Sir,

Exon. Aug. 1. 1668.
