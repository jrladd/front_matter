WORTHY SIR:
THe wings of my vnde∣seruing Muse (impro∣ued on with the good o∣pinion of her Patron) heretofore presumed to so are Hawke-hie; yet as then I spake particular: but now (as well for the pro∣pagation of the noble sport, as for the explanation of the effects of nature) J presume to dedicate to your noble Judg∣ment in that sport, a generalitie of defi∣nitions in Hawks, both in Names & Natures: the perfection of my paines (like a Diamond set in gold) rests in

the truth of your opinion. And as in the naturall motion of the heauens, the greater circumference euer moues the lesser; so (I make no question) if your deseruing iudgement giue me approba∣tion, all other censures will consequently leuill with your Ayme: I so far tooke a∣quaintance of presumption to chuse you for my Patron, being assured your Judgement will giue a more luster to my labours. Vertue J doe make my Mistris; and finding her keepe open house in your addicted inclination; I thought no toyle laborious to attain rest in such a harbor. Jf your charitie refuse to patronize this poore expression of a well wisher, J wish it had been still borne▪ but my hope is, your noble Na∣ture will both giue it life, and nourish it; for which I shall euer rest,
