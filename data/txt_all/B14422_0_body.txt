THat in the publishing of this Sermon I haue thus aduenturingly presumed to front it with your name: others happily may question, your selfe wonder. Suffice it, that I can say of my Dedication, as our prudent Soueraign of his (if at lest I may dare with so vnworthy and rude a hand,
In his Ma∣iesties pre∣face to his meditation vpon the Lords prai∣er. to pluck a leafe from that royall Tree, & sticke it in mine owne garland) that yet I haue obserued a decorum in the do∣ing of it. The renowned fame of your military science and heroicall valour, re∣ported and confirmed vnto the world, by the mouthes of so many witnesses, suf∣ficiently
assures me that you haue an in∣terest in this argument, and are there∣fore a meete person to whom I may make my dedication.
For mine owne particular; I doe in∣genuously confesse, that to your noble selfe I am altogether an immeriting stran∣ger. Yet seeing by the prouidence of God, you were an Auditor at this Sermon; and that it then pleased you to lend it your patient attention, afterward your fauourable approbation; loe now for a complement vnto both, I am further bold to craue for it your gentle patro∣nage and protection Which if I may ob∣taine, I shall not cease to pray for you, that you may long continue an honour, and ornament to your truely noble fami∣lie; nor in any Christian seruice refuse, to be alwayes
