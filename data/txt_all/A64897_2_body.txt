HAving by Gods good hand of providence and dire∣ction (Right Worshipfull and my most highly honour∣ed good friends) undertaken a subject of Gratitude to our holy God in this succeeding historicall nar∣ration of all his wonder-striking Parliamentarie-mer∣cies to us of this English-Nation, in generall; I could not but re∣flect my serious thoughts on your Worships as most worthie objects also of my thankefull heart, for many singular favours and courtesies toward me, in particular. And somuch the rather be∣cause of that which Chrysostome, in his 51 Homilie on Genesis, hath as sweetly as succinctly touched. Nihil tam gratum Deo & homini quam anima grata & gratias agens. Nothing in the world is so acceptable to God or man as a gratefull-heart and a thankeful∣tongue. The due and deep consideration whereof (I say) hath

made me most desirous (as most bounden) to tender this umbl and plain-sti'd historie of Englands God in the Mount of Mercies, r, Englands Remembrancer of gratitude to God for all the Parlia∣mentarie precious blessings most fully and freely conferred; or ra∣ther poured-down upon her within these 2 yeers last past, as a e∣stimonie of my most thankfull-heart to your good Worships for many both publike and private favours to me and mine. Which historie though I ingenuously acknowledge it might well have befitted a far more fluent and high-soaring rhetoriall-Penman than my poor and plain unworthie-self; yet since it hath pleased the Lord that my poor zeal for Gods glorie hath thus prevented them, I most humbly hope and heartily desire candide and cour∣teous acceptance of it and of my sincere desire and endeavour, mainly, to manifest my infinitely obliged gratefull-heart, first, to our ever-living and ever-loving wonder-working Lord God; next, to our most Pious Patriots, his precious Agents and instru∣ments in these great and glorious works; and then to your wor∣thie selves my much honoured friends: Which my endeavour herein, though short (I say) of your judicious expctation, and of the histories due desert, yet hoping it may remain as a pledge of my plighted humble services and bounden gratitude, and as the best Barthol'mew-faring, which my poor abilitie was able to present to your good Worships, with the humble tender also of m heartiest poor prayers to the throne of grace for all sanctified sub∣lunarie blessings and celestiall soul-cheering graces on you and al yours, I ever rest,
