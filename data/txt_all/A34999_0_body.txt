Resplendid Sir,
I Had both considerati∣on,
and modesty
enough, to have for∣born
this sawcy at∣empt,
in the Dedication of this

Heroick-Lover, to Your Royal
Self; but when I called to mind,
the many, and extraordinary fa∣vours,
Your Majestie received a
the Spanish Court, in Your sad
necessitated retirement thither
who next to Heaven, were both
the Preservers and Restorers o
Your Royal Person here: I
should have committed a double
sin, in recommending the prote∣ction
of this Infanta, to any other,
but Your Majestie; the one of in∣gratitude
to their unparallel'd
courtesie; and the other, of injury
and offence, to Your sacred Ma∣jestie;
in presuming that any was

more willing, or more able, to de∣fend
her, then Your Greater Self.
It is a Poem, consisting more of
fatal Truth, then flying Fancy:
penn'd many years ago, but not
published till now: the Muses
among our sad misfortunes here,
suffering an Ecclipse: which I
hope Your most Illustrious Rayes
will over-power, and give an en∣couragement,
suitable to so high
and noble a faculty, as other your
Majesties Ancestors have done:
more especially, that never to be
forgotten Martyr, and Mirror of
our Age, Your Majesties most
Resplendent Father. What dis∣countenance

soever it shall meet
withall in the world, so it hath but
the honour of Your Royal appro∣bation,
it will be more then suffici∣ent
to protect
