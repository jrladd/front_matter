Beloved Brethren,
I Had not undertaken this encounter with you, if I had not been fortified with speciall and pe∣culiar notions and arguments, which you have not heard of from other men; and those clearly deducible from sacred Scripture. I am not cer∣tain that some of your Brethren, from whom you dissent, will approve some things that I have held forth; neither yet doe I approve all that they hold against your doctrine, as it will ap∣pear in divers Arguments, and Reasons rendred. I shall desire to hear from you either publickly, or in private, how you resent such notions, and how you apprehend them; that if any thing be dark or doubtfull therein, I might clear it up, what my mean∣ing is, and what the truth is allso, as I doubt not but to do in a short space by the help of God. I hope your principles are such, not to despise any rich treasure, because of the vessell that hold∣eth it forth, but search the Scriptures, whether these things be so. And besides, I doe conceive that it much troubleth you, that you cannot conceive how to reconcile your Brethrens doctrines with the Attributes of God, and therefore are forced to dissent and separate from them much against your wils: All which, if it be true, it may possibly cause you so to deny your selves, as to submit to the truth, when you see it, and give glory unto God, who is the Truth it self, and the only Fountain from whence it cometh, through what ever pipes it is conveyed unto you. I
much doubt not but you will acknowledge, that God hideth things from the wise and prudent, that he revealeth unto babes; and that on purpose that no flesh should glory in his pre∣sence, but that he that glorieth might glory in the Lord. And lest men should say, they have found out wisedome; as the peo∣ple were too many for Gedeon, that the Lord should deliver Israel into their hands, lest they should have said, their own hands, and not the Lord, had saved them: So some men are too wise to have knowledge given them of some secrets, lest the people should idolize the men, as having found them out by their own wisedome, & not give glory unto God; but he will not give his glory to another: And therefore wise men sometimes must be content to receive knowledge at the second hand; and they are wise indeed, if they can be content to receive it from fools, yea from base things, in repute of the world, and mean, & contemptible; and so they sometimes must, or else be without. But I need not inform you of these things, save only to put you in remembrance: I therefore break off, and commit you to God, who is able to lead us into all truth, and to reveal unto us even his whole counsell, and work us up, through faith and love, to faithfull obedience, and submission to his will, and to make us perfect in every good word and work; Which the Lord grant both to you and me in his due time. Amen, Amen.
