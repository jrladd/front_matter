SIR, it is not long, since it first pleased you to grace mee with your acquaintance. Yet in so littell time, I haue obserued great arguments, of your more then most singular loue, to this neuer sufficiently beloued and admired faculty of Mu∣sick: as namely, the perfit pleasure and content∣ment you seeme to take therein; Your indefati∣gable assiduitie in the priuate exercise thereof, which hath gayned you such a perfection that way, as is rare in a Gentelman of your ranck:
And lastly your courteous and amiable deportment toward my poore selfe, and others, such as my selfe; the sonnes of Musick, when by chance you light among vs. Vnworthie were I then of that thrise worthie Mother, vn∣worthie to be phrased a sonne of Musick, should I not hartely affect and ho∣nour you, in such sort as I doe, whom I find so intirely to loue and honour hir. And hence it is, euen of my loue which you haue well deserued for loueing hir so well, that I haue singled you out among so many my worshipfull good friends for the Patron of these my second labours, & haue first presented them vnto your name, that vnder your protection and countenance they might passe abroad into the world. May it please you therefore to entertaine them, comming from a good affection, with a fauourable acceptance▪ which I assure my selfe you gentelnesse will vouchsafe to doe; especially since they come in so seasonable a time, at the very entrance of a new yeere, when vsually all gifts are well taken, euen trifles at their hands whose abilitie will not reach to pre∣sent matters of higher worth: And so I humbly take my leaue,
from Ely house in Holborne.
