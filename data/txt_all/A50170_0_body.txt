May it please Your Lordship;
IF it be considered, that some Evangelical and Apostolical Histories of the New-Testa∣ment, were by the Direction of the Holy Spirit Himself, Dedicated unto a Person of Quality, and tha the Noble Person Addressed with One such Dedicain, entertained it with Resentments that encouraged his dear Lucillius to make a Second, the world Will be satisfy'd that I do a thing but Reasnable and Agreeable, when, unto a Narrative of many Evangelical and Apostolical Affars, I presume to prefix the Name of one so Excellent for Love to God, as Your Lordship is known to be: and One
 upon this account only, an Unmeet subject for th praises of the obscure pen which now writes, tha Quis Vituperat? I do not, I dare not, so far In∣trude upon Your Honour, as to ask Your Patro∣nage unto all the New-English Principles & Pra∣ctices, which are found in the Character of our Celebrated ELIOT; for; as the Distance of a Thousand Leagues, ha made it impossible for me to attend the (usual) Orders and Manners of asking first Your Allowance for what I have openly Entitled you unto; so, the Renowned ELIOT is gone beyond any occasions for the greatest Humane Paronage.
But that which has procured unto Your Lordship, the Trouble of this Dedication, is, My Desire to Give You the Picture of One Aged Saint, Lately gone to that General Assem∣bly, which the Eternal King of Heaven, by the Advances of Your Own Age in the way of Righteousness does quickly Summon Your Self unto The Profound Respect which Our ELIOT had for Your Honour, will doubless be an∣swered and requited with Your own Value for the Memory of such a memorable Christian, Ministe and Evangelist; inasmuch as, Your Affections like his, take not their Measures from these or those matters of Doub fl Dispuatum, but from such an universal Pie, and Charity, and Holiness, as he was an Instance of.
No man ever complained of it that in the works of Chrysostom, we find seven Orations no
 for asunder, in Commendation of Paul:  it any fault that I have now written One, in Com∣mendation of a man whom a Pauline Spirit, had made Illustrious. In describing him, I have made but little Touches upon his Parentage, and Family, because as the truly Great Basil excuses his Omission of those things, in his Oration upon Gordius the Martyr, Ecclesia haec tanquam super∣vacaa dimittit. But I have related those things of him, which cannot but create a good Esteem for him, in the Breast of your Lordship, who are a Faithful and Ancient Witness against those Distempers of the world, whereby (as the blessed Salian Lamented it) Cogimur esse Viles ut Nobiles habeamur; and Raise the sweetness of Your Thoughts upon Your Approaches, which may our God make both slow and sure, unto that State, wherein, The Least is Greater than this JOHN. But if I may more ingenu∣ously Confess the whole Ground and Cause of this Dedication, I must own, 'Tis to pay  part of a Debt; a Debt under which You have laid my Countrey, when You did with Your Own Honourable Hand, Present unto His Maje∣sty the same Account, which I have here again Published, Concerning the Success of the Gospel a∣mong the Idians in New-England.
My Lord, In one ELIOT, You see what a People 'tis, that You have counted worthy of Your Notice; and what a People 'tis, that with adent Prayers bespeak the Mercies of Heaven
 for Your Noble Family. Indeed, It is Impo¦sible that a country So full as New-England is, of what is truly Primitive, should not be ex∣posed unto the bitterest Enmity and Calumny of those, that will strive to entangle the Church in a Sardian Unreformedness, until our Jesus do shortly Make them know, that He has loved, what they have hated, maligned, persecuted. But if the God of New-England have inclined any Great Personage, to Intercede or Interpose for the prevention of the Ruines which ill men have designed for such Country; or to procure for a a People of an Eliot's Complexion in Religi∣on, the Undisturbed Enjoyment and Exercise of that Religion: it is a thing that calls for our most sensible Acknowledgments.
It is an odd Superstition which the Indians of this countrey have among them, that they count it (on the penalty of otherwise never prospering more) necessary for them, never to pass by the Graves of certain famous persons a∣mong them, without laying and leaving some Token of Regard thereupon. But we hope that all true Protestants, will count it no more  what is equal and proper, that the Land which has in it, the Grave of such a Remarkable Preacher to the Indians as our ELIOT, should be treated with such a Love, as a Jerusalem, u∣ses to find from them that are to prosper.
Upon that Score then, Let My Lord Accep a Present from and for a Remote corner in th
 New World, where God is Praised on Your be∣half; a small Present made by the Hand of a Rude American, who has nothing to recommend him unto Your Lordship, except this, That he is the SON of ONE whom You have admitted unto Your Favours; and, That he is Ambiti∣ous to Wear the Title of,
MY LORD,
