SIR,
AS Good is communicative of it self, I thought my self obliged to make the Publick partaker of the Good I have received from God, by an effect of his Grace, in acknowledging the Reasons which have abliged me to leave the Errors of the Romish Communion, that I have fol∣lowed all my Life, and preached since I was a Priest thereof, until that God spoke to me, as to Saul, Why persecutest thou me? But as I see nothing more able to welcome it into the World, than by dedicating it unto your self, I take the liberty to present it to you, to the end that being sustained upon one of the strongest Pillars of the Reformed Church, it may be better received from it. In effect, what greater advantage could I have in this occasion, where I desire to make known the Errors of the Romish Church that I have left, to em∣brace the purity of the Gospel, which is practised in the Re∣formed Religion, than to produce this effect of my Studies, under the protection of a Person, who not only by the force of his Words, in his learned Writings, and by his continual Preaching, but also by the good example of his Manners, maketh known to all the World, that he maketh a particular profession to follow Jesus Christ, in the purity of his Word? In effect, the one appeareth to us in all your actions, and the perfect renunciation of all the Grandeurs of the World, which hath made you so often refuse the eminentest Charges of the Church, doth not permit us to doubt thereof; and the other
 appeareth in many learned Books, and in daily Sermons, where the force of Grace supplieth the want of Nature, weak∣ned by long and painful Studies; so as St. Basil said of St. Gregory, One knows not which appeareth more in you, whether the holiness of your Manners, or the purity of your Doctrine; you are of those true Pastors who are powerful in works and words, who sustain by their example that which they teach by a lively Word and by Writing; in a word, who made themselves all to all for to gain all to Jesus Christ. Pardon me, Sir, if by advancing these Truths, I do violence to your Modesty: This Consideration hindreth me to say any more of it, and is the reason, why retaining to my self the Sentiments that I am obliged to have of it, I hold my peace, in asking you permission to style my self, as I am, with a most profound Respect,
Sir,
