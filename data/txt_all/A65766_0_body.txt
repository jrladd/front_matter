Gentlemen!
YOU being generally my Au∣ditors, at the Time of my de∣livering this Ensuing Discourse, were quicken'd from what you have heard, to make it your general desire, by the Mediation of several of the Chief amongst you, that I would make my late Discourse more Publick, by the Printing of it: This being the first Request in this kind, which you ever made unto me; I am therefore
the more willing to comply with it, espe∣cially considering, that I know not how much of a Call from Providence, there may be in your so general Concurrence, in this matter: I commit the Ensuing Dis∣course to the Divine Blessing, and you all to the Divine Protection, subscribing my self,

Nov. 13. 1693.
