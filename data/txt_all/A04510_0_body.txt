A SMALE gifte agreth
with my smal habilitie
but not with the great¦nesse
of your desertes,
whiche iustely to sette
furth, I leaue to suche,
as maye wyth greater
vessels wade more aptly in so large a
sea. Nat that wantyng power, I doo
want of good wil also, wherin I dare
compare with the formest. It may li∣ke
you therfore of your singuler good¦nes,
whiche so many haue proued, yf
you like nat my dede herin, at leste to
allowe my entente, whiche in great
thynges thought it a second prayse to
wyll well. Fare ye no wourse, then
your vertue requireth, the fauour of
men wisheth, and your own dexterite
promiseth.
