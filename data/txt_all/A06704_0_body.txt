GEntle Sir, to rippe vp the excellent parts abiding in you, might be reputed Parasiti∣call by many, and offensiue to you, whom I know no whit vaine glorious: to disclose your kindnesle towards my weake deser∣uing, would be acounted follie: that I could not receiue a benefit, but make all the world acquainted therewith: to desire you secure this poore infant of my braine with your fauour, as with Aiax shield were too trite an imitation, an apes tricke: therefore leauing fawning to flatterers, and offence to him that mindes it: bequeathing follie to such, as will not keepe their owne councell and imi∣tation to them that cannot inuent, I doe plainely present this part of my loue vnto you.
