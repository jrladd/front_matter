May it please your Lordship,
THE Cause of Virtue belongs to great and brave Men; therefore I thought it my Duty to

lay this Treatise at your Lordships Feet; it will not much enlarge your Thoughts, or acquaint you with any new things; but I hope, it may please the Generosity of your Temper, to read the Characters of Virtues, the greatest Ornaments of that pure Religion, which your Lordship hath labour∣ed so much to recover from the Knavery and base Cor∣ruptions, as well as Bondage of Popery: For the Jesuits Morals are as destructive of a good Life, and as perni∣cious to human Society, as

their Plots and their Gun-Powder.
I am very well satisfied, that if I had sought a Patron in all the List of Noble Per∣sons, I could not have found a more proper or competent Judge in a Discourse of this Nature; because your Lord∣ships Case, and that of Virtue it self, have been much alike; you have been both perse∣cuted for your Integrity and Truth; but like Truth, you must and shall prevail, in spight of the malicious and the false, the Parasite or the De∣tractor.
I have not troubled your Lordship with the fine and nice Speculations in Divinity, because they have done our Religion much Dis-service, by raising a multitude of Questions, which neither ad∣vance true Piety, nor good Manners: But I present your Lordship with the Rules of naked Truth and Reason; the free Use whereof is as much our Birthright, as any thing else: Therefore your Lord∣ships Name, and the Names of all those shall be had in e∣verlasting remembrance, who have placed Their Majesties

upon the Throne; whereby not only our Properties, but our Understandings are secur∣ed to us, and an healing Plai∣ster is laid upon all our Ma∣ladies: For we must needs say, our Nation was in a very distempered Condition, be∣fore it came into the hands of this wise and great Prince WILLIAM the Third, whose Breaches in its Man∣ners, as well as in its Laws, may be made up by his sea∣sonable Application of the most proper Remedies; as its Greatness and Glory will e∣ver be maintained by His

Wisdom, Power, and Cou∣rage under the Influence of these Royal Virtues; England, methinks, begins to recover its just Temper apace, and the old British Genius revives; so that in time it may be re∣stored to a perfect Health, as strong Bodies will work out the Poyson they take, by degrees.
That this Deliverance, which hath been so wonder∣fully wrought for us, may have the same effect upon our Country, which the Christian Religion had at its first en∣trance into it, when it did so

quickly turn the first Inhabi∣tants of this Island, who were uncivilized and barbarous, into humble, affable, meek, cha∣ritable, modest, prudent, tender, and compassionate Creatures.
That the Practice of Vir∣tue may be establish'd in these Kingdoms, without which the firmest Government must dissolve; because a regard to that will ever have an In∣fluence upon the Honour and Authority of those, who rule, as well as upon the Hap∣piness and safety of those who obey.
And that your Lordship may long enjoy the only Sweetness of Life, a retreat from Noise and Disturbance, that nothing may break or interrupt your Thoughts in the ways of Virtue and Good∣ness, is the Prayer of
May it please your Lordship,
