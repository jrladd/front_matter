My Lord,
IF those High and Weighty Employ∣ments to which your Great Worth and A∣bilities, approved by the Judgment of the most Experien∣ced King of Christendom, have Cal∣led
you, can Admit of any Diver∣tisement, it will not, I hope, be thought a Sin in me, if I have Attempted thus to Contribute something towards it, or if it should, yet be pardoned as the Fault of a too hasty Zeal, in a Person desirous to thrust himself amongst the croud of your Adorers.
For deservedly have you, my Lord, Drawn the Hearts and Affections of the whole English Nation to your Self; and never did King and Peo∣ple so Unanimously agree in the Choice of such a great Minister of State: Your Virtues making all the World Admire the Kings Judgment,
and the Kings Judgment confirming to all the World, their long before entertained Opinion of your Virtues.
The King is, my Lord, (notwith∣standing all Popish pretences) sole Vi∣car and Vicegerant under God, in his own Realms and Dominions; and he has Chosen you his Substitute in the Management of his Highest and Greatest Affairs, wherein your Con∣duct has been such, as has given him every day new Encouragement to ap∣prove the Work of his own Hands, and he cannot but with Delight and Satisfaction hear with what Accla∣mations of Joy and Content, the whole Body of the Nation Applaud
your Justice, Prudence, and Equity whereby you have almost quite re∣moved all Misapprehensions they had sometime conceived against Chan∣cellors.
Nor has your Zeal in the Prote∣cting and Defending the Settled and Established Protestant Religion in this Kingdom, appeared less then your great Abilities in State, you ha∣ving largely Contributed your Counsel and Assistance both to King and Parliament, for the Weakning the hands of our common Enemy, and may therefore claim a Right to Divertise your Self at their Follies.
But however, my Lord, this
small Present of mine prove, let not my Duty and Devotion be accounted a Crime, nor that be Blemished as a Presumption, which is a sincere tender of my part of that Service and Affection which all men pay you, and which shall ever be Paid you by
My Lord,
