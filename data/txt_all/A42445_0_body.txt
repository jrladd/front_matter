Most Reverend and Honored,
HAving by your Appointment preach'd the following Ser∣mons, and publish'd them by your Command, I humbly desire this Dedi∣cation of them to you may be accepted as some Acknowledgment for that great Trust you have been pleased to honour me with.
I have nothing to say for the Perfor∣mance, but that I have endeavoured all I could to proportion my Care to the Subject and Design of the Lecture;
and where the Management is faulty, I have reason to hope the Evidence of the Truths I defend will bear me out.
I have taken the Liberty to Print my Sermons all together in a continu'd Dis∣course, that the Strength of the Proofs there given may appear more plainly from their Connexion.
If it shall please God to render what I have done, in any degree or measure serviceable towards the raising or pro∣moting a Sense of Religion among us, I shall extreamly rejoyce at my Success; and I am sure I shall have my Satisfa∣ction encreased by your Approbation of my Endeavours, and by your far∣ther Protection and Defence of the same Cause in which I am now particularly engaged, and which ought to be the general Concern of Mankind. I am,
Most Reverend and Honored,
