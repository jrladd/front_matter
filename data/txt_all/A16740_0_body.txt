WOrthy KNIGHT The longe affe∣ctionate duty, wherin I haue fol∣lowed your vnde∣serued fauour, hath made me study how to prooue some parte of

my protestation: but finding my spirite by the crosses of fortune, vnable to be it selfe, in the best nature of thankfulnesse, I haue yet, by Gods greate blessing, laboured in the vineyard of a vertuous loue, where hauing gathered those fruites, that are both pleasant and holsome, bounde vp this little handfull, I presente them to your patience, knowing that your loue to learning, your zeale in Reli∣gion, and your wisdome in iud∣gement (being able in diuine Con∣siderations, to finde comforte a∣boue the worlde) will vouchafe to make that good vse of them, that maie giue me comforte in your regarde of them: but least te∣diousnesse maie prooue displeasing

yea in matter of much worth, I wil leaue my labour to your liking, and my seruice to your imploimēt, in which I humblye rest in heartie prayer for your much happinesse.
