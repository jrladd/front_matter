TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE, ROBERT EARLE
OF ESSEX AND EWE, EARLE MAR∣shall
of England, Viscount Hereford, Lord Fer∣rers
of Charley, Bourchier and Louaine, Knight of the
most noble order of the Garter, Maister of her Maiesties
Horse, and Ordenance, Chauncellor of the Vniuersity of
Cambridge, and one of her Highnesse most honorable Priuy
Counsell, RICHARD CRVMPTON desireth
eternall felicitie.
THere is no kingdome (Right
honorable) so strongly seated,
or with Castles so fortified, or
that so aboundeth in wealth,
which without valiant men
trained vp in martiall disci∣pline,
can be defended from the force of the e∣nemy:
for the stronger or richer the countrey is,
the more are the snares and sleights prepared
by the enemy to compasse and conquer the
same: for which cause, and for that also, occasions
of warre are often offered vpon the sodaine, it is

necessary that some number of men should be
trained vp continually in martiall actions, as in
other countries is vsed, and so much the rather,
where long peace hath bene had, which often
taketh away the feare of warre, & causeth men
to liue too securely and without regard of for∣reyne
danger, whereby they are vnskilfull in
warres affaires: and that such trained men may
be alwaies ready and able to informe and leade
others vnexperiēced in that seruice: for it is not
the number of men that alwayes obtayneth the
victory in battell, but such as are couragious,
and well exercised in martiall skill, as Eras∣mus
sayth well:Erasmus. Non refert quàm numerosum militem
ducas in praelium, sed quàm fortem, & quàm exercitatum.
Homer in these few verses following,Homer. setteth forth
the whole military discipline, which resteth in
the valour of the souldiers, and their obedi∣ence
to their Captaines and Leaders.
Graeci fidentes animis audacibus ibant,
Ductorum quamuis premerent formidine vocem.
VVhere he sayth, that they trusting in their cou∣ragious
minds, went against their enemies,
there he commendeth and extolleth their va∣lours
in armes: and where he sayth, they feared

the commandement of their Captaines, there
he highly praiseth their great discretion and
modesty. VVhat bred such fame to the ATHE∣NIANS,
who being but ten thousand, ouerthrew
great numbers of the PERSIANS in one battell,
in that time when they most florished in their
conquests, and did rule ouer many nations, but
valour and skill in the souldiers, and obserua∣tion
of orders in battell? By order all things are
preserued and maintayned, and without order
all things come to ruine and confusion, as the
Scripture sayth, Vbi nullus ordo ibi est confusio. And
as these things are requisite in the souldiers, so
is experience, valour, and skill also in the Cap∣taine:
for if the blind leade the blind, both fall
into the ditch, as the Gospell witnesseth: there∣fore
such Captaines are alwayes highly to be
honoured, imbraced, aduanced, and re∣warded,
according to their places, callings,
and deserts, as the defenders in the time of
warre of the Prince and state of the kingdome
and common-wealth, that they may be incou∣raged
in that seruice: and such as lightly e∣steeme
these men, or preferre them which
liue idlely and daintily afore them, are ene∣mies

to the Common-wealth (as Osorius wri∣teth)
and to be taken as the destroyers there∣of,
in that they doe as much as in them lyeth,
to lay open their Countrey to the force of the
enemie. And because the matter of this Trea∣tise
concerneth the defence of our Prince
and Countrey against the enemie, which
seruice appertaineth most properly to men of
honour, who ought to hold nothing more
deere to them then the safety of the same, of
which they be the chiefe props, stayes, de∣fenders,
and mayntainers vnder her Maiestie;
I haue thought it conuenient to dedicate this
little Treatise to a man of such state, and vnto
your honour chiefly, to the ende you may
therein see the notable actes of Chiualrie per∣formed
in that seruice, that thereby you may
be incouraged to followe their steppes, and
increase the fame, honour, and renowme,
which you haue attayned in your late valiant
seruice at CALES in SPAINE, and else where.
Humbly beseeching your honor to accept this
my small labour, as a token of my desire to cō∣mend
your Honourable name to posteritie.
