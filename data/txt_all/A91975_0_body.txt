Worthy Sirs,
THough I may not, do not exclude You from the number of those to whom I make the generall Ad∣dress which follows; yet I cannot but think it convenient, and (in some sort) necessary to premise this speciall Address unto Your selves alone; partly to give a publique Testimony of my due re∣spects unto You all, for Your ready compliance and assi∣stance in a Regular, Peaceable way, to detect and defeat
so dangerous and desperate an enemy of Truth, Holiness and the power of Godliness; and partly to give the world no∣tice, That as You are able to Witness against severall for∣geries and falsehoods in Coppin's Relation, so Your con∣sciences (besides multitudes more) can bear me Witness concerning the Truth of whatsoever I have written in the following Narrative, as to what publiquely passed between us: from first to last You were present, and heard what∣soever past either on one side or the other; and therefore I dare appeal to Your consciences, and make You Judges concerning the verity of that account I have given, my own conscience bearing me witness in the sight of God, That I have dealt faithfully in it. I expect that Coppin and such as he is will be snarling at me, when ence these lines are passed the Press, but I bless God I pass not for their snarling, nor do I fear their biting. Magna ve∣ricas & praevalet. If I lie under a generall odium of hereticall spirits, I cannot count it the least dishonour, or be troubled at it. St Jerome was certainly very right in his judgment, when he wrote to St Augustine, Quod signum majoris gloriae est, omnes haeretici te dete. stantur. For my part I affect not the good words of those that speak such evil words of my blessed Saviour; let them bark against me, that bark against the Truth of Christ, while they will: They shall neither hurt the Truth nor me, more than barking Dogs do the Moon: Yet I doubt not, could they get power into their hands, answerable to the malice which is in their hearts, they would soon make mad work against all such as being fast friends to Truth and Holiness, shew themselves resolute enemies to their Hereticall, filthy Opinions and practises; Ingenium Haereticum est sanguinarium: Truly Gentle∣men I am perswaded You could not but observe and be, very sensible, how Coppin made it his Master-piece to
mingle and winde himself into the bosomes of (a many headed Monster) the rude multitude, having no minde to heed or answer any Argument brought against him, but labouring to insinuate himself into the affections of a deluded party, and engage them to a good opinion of him, expecting (no doubt) to have found his interest so great and strong, as would have born him out by club-Law, whatsoever might be alleadged against him: Nor can he have any better design in his Printed Pamphlet, which he hath caused to be dispersed in City and Country; so that in stead of the Title he gives it, it might justly hear this Title, A Wile of the Serpent, or a Subtill endeavour from Maidstone Prison, to increase and incourage a Deluded Party, advancing it self against Truth and Peace in Rochester: And whereas he makes a noise about four daies Disputes with severall Ministers in Rochester Cathedrall, You all can witness that for three of those daies he would never stand to any Dispute, but ranne out into wilde impertinent Discourses (and his fourth daies carriage to have been as wilde, himself doth witness in his own Printed Relation) so that after that rate he might take upon him to Dispute with all the Mi∣nisters in the world. I told You once and again, would he stand to any thing, I would not doubt, by Gods help, without study, with what I knew already out of Scripture, to answer him from morning to night. But I trouble You too much, and hold You too leng, while I am raking into this dunghill: The good Lord in mercy purge both City, Country and Studiers from the leaven of this mans Blasphemous, Hereticall and Atheisticall epinions, awa∣king both us that are Ministers, with You that are Civil Magistrates and Military Officers, with all Christian pru∣dence, zeal and courage in our Places and Caelings, to labour that the Mystery of Godliness, being vigerously pro∣pagated,
the mystery of Iniquity may be profligated, and the foggy mists, filthy smoke of damnable Errours, Here∣sies and Blasphemies being dissipated, the Su of Gospel Truth may break forth and shine with greater lustre, pu∣rity and power. Thus commending these Dedicatory lines to Your candid acceptance, and the ensuing Narrative to Your perusall and Patronage, I shall only subscribe my self, what indeed and truth I am,
