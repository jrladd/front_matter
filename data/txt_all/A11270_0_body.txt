THE report and consideration (Right Worship∣full of your exceeding courtesie, the great and immerited friendship, which I and my parentes haue, and do daylie find at the handes of that re∣nowned and vertuous Knight, your Father, doe embolden mee to present vnto your Worship this my vnpollished Poeme, from which otherwise, the imbecilitie of my skill in this diuine arte, and rudenesse of these my lines, doe alto∣gether dehort me. Which if your Worship (serious affairs ended) shall vouchsafe to cast a fauourable glaunce vpon, and therein shall find any part or parcell pleasing to your vertu∣ous mind, I shall esteeme my trauell as much worth, as had it otherwise beene spent, in winning the golden Apples of Hisperia, or in fetching precious Iems from the chrystall lake of the Pearl-flowing Tagus. The historie (I praesume) you shall finde delightfull; the matter not offensiue to anie, only my skill in penning it is, imbicill; and my presumption, in presenting so rude a peece of worke to so wise a Patrone, verie great: which I hope your Worship will the more bear with, and account the rather to bee pardonable, in that the fault proceedeth from a good intention and faultlesse mea∣ning.
