SIr, I have long cherished
a desire, by some wor∣thy
testimony, to expresse
how much I honour you:
But after a tedious ex∣pectation,
hopelesse to meete with an occa∣sion
to make me so fortunate; I resolued,
rather then to hazard the censure of neg∣lect,
to snatch any opportunity of present∣ing
my seruices. This (which to me
hath no name, but what your bounty
shall bestow) hauing pleased you vpon



the Stage, comming into the world, offe∣reth
it selfe to kisse your hand. If you be
merciful, I am vpon euen termes with
the world beside, and will study next to
reach your minde with imaginations of
a higher nature. In the meane time,
grow you vp, and ripen your selfe for
Honour; the flowings of your blood will
instruct you how to merit; while I rest
content with my ambition, if I may still
write my selfe,
