Right Worshipfull,
I Will not
make an
over—large
gate to my little City: A

short Epistle best suites
with so small a vo∣lume,
and both fitly
resemble your know∣ledge
of mee, and mine
acquaintance with you,
short, and small. But a
mite freely given, makes
a poore widow liberall:
and in this Present,
poore, like my habilities,
is a thankfulnesse, infi∣nite,
like your deser∣vings.
To speake much,
might be thought flat∣tery;
to say nothing

would be knowne ingra∣tiude:
I must therefore be
short, I may not bee si∣lent.
The happy fortune
of my tongue hath incou∣raged
my penne: and I
humbly crave in the one,
what I favourably found
in the other, a courteous
acceptance. Which if you
please to add to your for∣mer
favours, & my hap∣pinesse,
I shall have just
cause to rest
