TO patron more then truth hath here set forth
And art in these insuing Epigrams
Shall iustifie, I'le not desire your worth;
My merit shal not cringe with bended hams
To craue the censure of obstreperous tongues,
To comprobate m'inulcerd innocence:
VVhat I haue writ imputed are no wrongs,
But vnto such whose furie I'le not dispence,
Mildly to iudge or at the least dissemble,
To attribute each Histerologie
Vnto themselues and at surmises tremble,
Iudging to be what they'r not fit to be:
For application now is growne a trade,
And by construction, best the worst is made.


But if you deeme my stile too petulant,
(Outstripping th'limits of chast modesty)
Or think mine elate verse too insolent,

(Shrouding great mens crimes in dishonestie.)
Thinke that the passion to describe the error
Of such apparant mischiefe, sweld in time,
To a deformed Chaos, makes a terror
In patientst breasts, much more in Satyres Ryme;
Therefore I draine the sinewes of inuention,
To further length, then reason would admit,
Yet rightly iudge my muse no reprehension,
Can iustly merit (so the best thinke fit)
Yet this I'me bold, and will auerre it true
To saie, my verse onely hath forme from you.
