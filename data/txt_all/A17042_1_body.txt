NOT that the gift (Great Lord) deserues your hand,
(Held euer worth the rarest workes of men)
Offer I this; but since in all our Land
None can more rightly claime a Poet's Pen:
That Noble Bloud and Vertue truly knowne,
Which circular in you vnited run,
Makes you each good, & euery good your owne,
If it can hold in what my Muse hath done.
But weake and lowly are these tuned Layes,
Yet though but weake to win faire Memorie,
You may improue them, and your gracing raise;
For things are priz'd as their possessours be.
If for such fauour they haue worthlesse striuen,
Since Loue the cause was, be that Loue forgiuen!
