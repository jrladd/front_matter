THe Season is of Joy, the Gift of Tears:
This seems a discord unto common ears.
But he that makes the ficrcest wolf to sleep,
And feed in friendship with the weakest sheep,
Vnites remotest passions, and can bring
Waters of comfort from griefs bitter spring:
The Jolliest Baltaser on earth may borrow
True Joy of him who seems o'rewhelm'd in sorrow.
Begin the Year, and pass it in these Tears,
They'l yield you joy against your greatest fears.
And kindly entertain your poor friends thrift.
A Renew'd Peter, for a New-years-gift.
