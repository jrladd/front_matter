Great SIR,
THE Dedication of this following History of the Turks, may most justly be Addressed to the Clemency and Patronage of Your Majesty for Two Reasons. First, Because the greatest Part of this Treatise was Written at Ham∣burg, whilst I was actually employed for the space al∣most of Eleven Years in the Service of Your Majesty, the which, I hope will not be looked upon as a Point of my Demerit, or Neglect in my Duty, to have taken out so many Hours as this Work might Require from the Service of Your Majesty. For I can safely say, and that Your Majesty's Secretaries also in England, and Abroad, can Attest for me, that I have been diligent in my Office, and have neglected nothing therein, which my Duty and Services to Your Majesty might require, and expect from me; for it was Written at my Vacant Hours, when nothing of my other Services could give me the least Avocation.
But what may chiefly oblige me farther to this De∣dication, is the Healing, Powerful, and Successful Hand which Your Majesty hath Applied by Your Ambassa∣dors, in making that Peace at Carlowitz, between the Christians and the Turks, which will ever be remembred in Future Ages, and which (as Your former Actions shewed the World You were a great Captain in the Arts of
 War) so this will give good Proof You were a Wise and Prudent Governor in the Exercises of Peace; And may deserve to have that Motto inserted in Your Escocheon, Beati sunt Pacifici.
And so may Your Majesty be always Blessed and Prosperous in this Life, and Your Great Good Works Rewarded in Heaven. Which are the most Devout Prayers of

Hamburgh Jan 15. 1700.
