SIR,
I Send this Booke to you, because
you first directed me to this de∣signe;
The learned Gassendus was
my precedent; whom neverthe∣lesse
I have not followed in his
partiality: For he, though limited to a single
person, yet giveth himselfe liberty of enlarge∣ment,
and taketh occasion from his subject
to make the world acquainted with many ex∣cellent
disquisitions of his owne. Our scope be∣ing
of a greater latitude, affords lesse opportu∣nity
to favour any particular; whilst there is
due to every one the commendation of their
owne deserts. This benefit I hope to have
received from the variety of the subject; but
far more are those I owe to your encourage∣ment,
which if I could wish lesse, I should upon
this occasion, that there might seeme to have

been expressed something of choice and incli∣nation
in this action, which is now but an in∣considerable
effect of the gratitude of,
Dear Vncle,
