TO MY VERIE
HONORABLE GOOD
Lords, IAMES Earle of Arran.
GEORGE Earle of Enzie, and IOHN
Earle of Cassils: three noble plants
happily planted by the right hand
of the most High, in that greene
and fruitfull garden of his dearest
Sonne; of speciall religious, vertu∣ous,
and valorous expectation: by
whom the true nobilitie of their
truly Noble Ancestors is not stai∣ned
but beautified; is not lessened
but enlarged; through the force of
the grace of God, blessing and
strengthening their Lordships.
