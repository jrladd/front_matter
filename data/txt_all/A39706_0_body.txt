Madame,
To whom should I De∣dicate
these Characters
but only to your Highnesse,
from whom I've tane all the
most Noble and Excellent;
besides Madam, I ow not
only to your Highness the
delicious leasure I had in
writing them. But if I seem
to surpass mediocrity, and
approach somewhat nigh
perfection, that Madame,

I ow unto you Highness too,
mediocrity in perfection be∣ing
never where you are; nor
can one think of any thing but
excellent beholding you; ow∣ing
this Work then to your
Highnes by so many names;
Permit me I beseech you,
Madam, withall Humility
to offer it at your feet, toge∣ther
with my self, with the
Protestation of being all my
Life,
Madame,
