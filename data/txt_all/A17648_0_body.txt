MAny in the dedicatiōs of their trauails are accu∣stomed to set forth the praises of such parsons as they do dedicate the same vnto. And surely J thinke it not a∣misse if flattery be absent. For who is ig∣norāt that virtus laudata crescit, praise vertue, and it shall encrease. I speake not this right worshipful and reuerende fa∣thers, to the ende that J meane to do the like to you, although no man that knoweth you but he will say you worthelye deserue the same: for if J shoulde either praise your learning or diligence in your vocati∣on
 which euery where is knowen, or your, godly cōuersation which vnto your nigh∣est frendes is well tried, or your libera∣lity which all those that haue neede, but spetially the Godly poore haue found and daily do fynde, who might iustly reprehēd me: but letting passe these thinges to the consideratiō of vpright iudges, I purpose to shew and that very brieflye what hath moued me to dedicate this present booke vnto your worshippes. you knowe that I receaued at your handes (that worthye man maister D. Watts beynge then a∣liue, whom with reuerence I remember) that liuinge which J haue: and althoughe you sell not your benefices (as manye in these dayes do) yet reason woulde that J should not remaine vnthankefull for the same, though it were a greate deale lesse then it is. And wheras want of abilitye
 vvould not suffer me to recōpence other∣vvyse your good will, yet rather then still I should continue vnthankeful, I chose this litle commentary of that worthye fa∣ther M. Caluine to supply that which els might be left vndon: vvherin J vvish that my hart lay open to be vievved: then vvould you not more regard the thinge it selfe, vvhich no doubt is vvorthy the ac∣cepting, thē the good vvil of him that pre∣senteth the same vnto you. Fare you vvel. At high Easter the first of Nouember.
