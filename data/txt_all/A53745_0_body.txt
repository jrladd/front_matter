The Convincing and Awakening this sinful secure Nation, that because the Sins specified therein abound in the midst of us, and our late National Deliverances have not been im∣proved to a general Reformation, therefore God by his▪ Judgments, especially his imme∣diate Hand upon the Straits-Floet, doth evi∣dently declare he hath a Controversie with us. That this Necessary End might through in∣fluencing Grace be obtain'd, is and shall be in conjunction with yours, the hearty Prayers of
