AS the want of Lawes
occasioneth wrongs to
be committed witting∣ly;
And want of know∣ledge
of Lawes carieth men into
offences ignorantly: So are Laws
themselues a burthen when they
are too many, and their very num∣ber
is a cause that few are execu∣ted:
where Penall Lawes haue o∣therwise
no life, but in their exe∣cution.
And certainely that Ma∣gistrate
who knowes but few, and
causeth those to be duely obser∣ued,

deserueth better of the Com∣monwealth,
then he that knoweth
many, and executes but few.
Therefore is the Composition of
this Volume, that those few Laws,
and other ordinances being most
needfull for the time, may bee ea∣sily
had, soone knowne, and duely
executed; Which is required
by His MAIESTIE.
