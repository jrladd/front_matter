HAuing finished these two Bookes of Amadis de Gaule (the third and fourth, somewhat longer delayed, then was at the first intended) I am to intreate thy gentle fauour (courteous Rea∣der) for such slips and errors, as haue escaped mee in the Printing, and where Sence shall seeme lame or defectiue in any place, to helpe it with thy bet∣ter vnderstanding; as considering, that not wilfully: but ra∣ther vnwillingly, those faults haue escaped the Presse. By Mi∣chaelmasse Tearme next ensuing, I haue made promise, of the first and second Bookes of Amadis and so consequently the follow∣ing parts, as God and thy kinde fauour shall therein further me. Till when, accept these; a speedie spurre to hasten on the o∣ther.
