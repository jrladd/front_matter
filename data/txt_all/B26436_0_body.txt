My Lord,
IT is your honour, to be the great Patron of Learning; and its Proselites, when Kings (saith an Ancient) be Philosophers, then Kingdoms enjoy the fruit of Learned Peace; the same may be said of inferiour Princes in their Spheres, the Europian World is suffi∣cient Witness of Your polite Accomplish∣ments, both infused and acquired, whereby You have shined like another Cassiopeian Star in the Swedish Hemisphere: Your own Na∣tive Countrey received the Reflexion of Your Wisdom, in that firm Peace and Alliance we enjoy with that Heroick and Warlike Prince, the present Soveraign Commander of those famous Countries and Territories, described in this Treatise; whose Martial Progenitors destroyed the puissant Empire of Rome, and were the Hammer of Gods wrath, to break in pieces the Italian Luxury, and frowned the great Citie into ashes: Wherefore, it belong∣eth of right to Your Honour, to patronize the
 Description of those Countries, in your own Language, especially, seeing that so Learned a Prelate, Prince of the Gowne-men in those Territories, hath in this Elaborate Work exposed to publick view, the Acts of their famous Heroes, the strange Eccentrick Customs, Fashions, Attire, Sports, Battels, Feasts, Marriages, Religion, and Trades of these Northern Nations: together with hor∣rid Apparitions of Divels, the Antick Pre∣stigations of Conjurers, and Magical In∣chantments; the Rarities and Observables of all the Four Elements; but especially the ripping up of the Bowels and Interels of Na∣ture, in their various and admirable Mine∣rals, with many other Stupendious Relati∣ons, that create excellent delight and wonder in the diligent and curious Inquirer. The Translation whereof, being not able to abide the Censure of Your acute Judgment: Yet being the Instrument and occasion of its Pub∣lication to the World in our Native Tongue, I have made bold humbly to present it to your Lordships acceptance, being confident, that un∣der the shadow of Your Patronage, who have been, doubtless, an Eye-Witness of many of these Grand Wonders, it will shine with the more Orient Lustre.
