My most Honoured LORD:
WHen the Age declineth from her primi∣tiue vertue, and the Silken witts of the Time, (that I may borrow from our ac∣knowledg'd Master, learned IONSON) disgracing Nature, & harmonious Poë∣ie, are transported with many illiterate and prodigious births, it is not safe to appeare without Pro∣tection. Among all the names of Honour, this Comedie oweth most gratitude to your Lordship, whose cleere testi∣mony was to mee aboue a Theater, and I applaud the dex∣terity of my fate, that hath so well prepared a Dedication, whither my onely ambition would direct it. I am not pale, to thinke it is now expos'd to your more deliberate censure; For 'tis my security, that I haue studied your Lordships

Candor, and know you imitate the Divine nature which is mercifull aboue offence. Goe on great Lord and bee the volume of our English Honour, in whom while others, in∣vited by their birth and quickned with ambitious emula∣tion reade and study their principles, let mee be made happie enough to admire, and devote my selfe,
