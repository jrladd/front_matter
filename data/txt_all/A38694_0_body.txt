Madam,
POets however they may be modest otherwise, have always too good an opinion of what they write. The World when it sees this Play De∣dicated to Your Royal Highness, will con∣clude, I have more than my share of that Vanity. But I hope the honour I have of belonging to You, will excuse my presump∣tion. 'Tis the first thing I have produc'd in Your Service, and my Duty obliges me to what my Choice durst not else have as∣pir'd.
I am very sensible, Madam, how much it is beholding to Your Indulgence, for the success it had in the Acting, and Your Pro∣tection will be no less fortunate to it in the Printing; for all are so ambitious of making their Court to You, that none can be severe to what you are pleas'd to favour.
This universal submission and respect is due to the greatness of Your Rank and Birth; but You have other Illustrious Qualities, which are much more ingaging. Those wou'd but dazle, did not these really charm the Eyes and Understandings of all who have the Happiness to approach You.
Authors on these occasions are never wanting to publish a particular of their Pa∣trons Virtues and Perfections; but Your Royal Highness's are so eminently known, that did I follow their Examples, I shou'd but paint those wonders here of which every one already has the Idea in his mind. Be∣sides, I do not think it proper to aim at that in Prose, which is so glorious a subject for Verse; in which hereafter if I show more

zeal than skill, it will not grieve me much, since I less passionately desire to be esteem'd a Poet, than to be thought,
Madam,
