My Lord,
THe Particular esteeme I have of your Merit, obli∣ged me to these Publick Proofes; being Ambitious the world should know, that though my inclinations be not strong enough to follow vertue, yet I never cease to build her Altars, in al places where I find her Image. To maintain (my Lord) that you are one of the most lively, the Eloquence of your actions surpassing that of my Discourse, has

already perswaded it to al the world, so that your Honesty having made it selfe known every where, I satisfie my selfe in praising you worthily, to declare your name, being one of the most accomplished Prelates of this Age. I speake not of those negotia∣tions of Importance which you have finished, to the Honour of the King, and Satisfaction of his Emminence who knew right well that the grea∣test Employments were under the reach of your Capacity. I wish with Passion, I had any in your service, wherby I might force you to beleeve that I am extreamly
My Lord,
