COurteous Reader,
The disease to which this Cure is applyed, is epidemicall. The hearts of men beeing anatomi∣zed, it will bee found, that the grand cause of their alienation from, and op∣position unto the waies of God: is a se∣cret obstruction, arising from that which as the seed of it, the Author calls Misprision. This Book de∣scribes the disease very lively, in the

Symptomes of it, and prescribes the Cure in a very artificiall method; laid downe in great variety of matter, and elegancy of conveyance. The receipt is made up of well chosen ingredients: strong, and therefore likely to be opera∣tive; sweet, & thereby inviting the pa∣tient to take it. If the Jaundies be re∣moved out of thy eye wherby the things of God have been represented to thee in a false colour: Let the chief Physiti∣an have all the glory of thy recovery, which is all the reward the confectioner expects for his paines.
