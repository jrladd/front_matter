Sir,
THe honour you were
pleased to do me, in put∣ting
me upon this enqui∣ry,
did not a little animate and
encourage me to persevere in
what I had begun with so happy
an Omen. My good Success
therefore herein, if any, is whol∣ly
to be ascribed to your self; as
being the first Excitor and chief
Abettor of it. And therefore I
hope that may be my excuse, for
craving You so great a Patron
thereunto, in that I could not
have entitled it to any other
without a manifest Injury to
Your Honour; whose Graci∣ous

countenancing of it, justly
requires my utmost Gratitude. I
must therefore with the Persian
offer to you, as he to the Sun,
what he believes himself to have
received from it. And therefore I
trust my endeavouring to soar a∣loft
with the Eagle, to enjoy the
Influence of the most Glorious
Light of the world, will find a
Pardon, and be judged much
better, than a hovering and flut∣tering
with the silly Fly about
the dim and fading Flame of a
candle, that at best, will but singe
those wings that raised it so
high, and in stead of giving it
more Vigour, will wholly disin∣able
it for the like Future At∣tempts.
I am not a little sensible
indeed, that the Minuteness both
of the thing and its Author, may
seem to make it a Present very

unfit for so great a Personage.
But yet I am in hope, that like
the poor man, that seeing many
Noble and Rich, hasting to meet
Artaxerxes, with their Splendid
and Sumptuous Gifts, would
needs carry somthing too, and
though 'twas but a little water
fetch'd out of the River in the
Palms of his Hands, yet addres∣sing
himself, he presented it with
an unexpected acceptance, I also
may be happy in the like success,
with this Oblation, which is but
a few drops taken out of the Ri∣ver
(as I may so speak) of the
Phaenomena of Nature (which
passes by, and is scarce regarded
by any, though free for all) that
is, some few observations, which
though but mean and obvious,
yet I think scarce diligently ta∣ken
notice of by any; and though

jumbled together in a careless, if
any Method, yet the best I had
leisure to throw it into. And
though delivered in a Style no∣thing
elegant, yet I hope (which
was my greatest aim) it may
serve (with your favourable con∣struction
of it) to signifie the de∣sire
I have of expressing my self
most affectionately to be
Sir,
