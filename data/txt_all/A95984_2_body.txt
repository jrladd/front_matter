GENTLEMEN!
MAny of these Papers were drawn by mee in my solitude in the Tower, and I never intended them for publick view, but for my private use; after∣wards Providence ordering it so, I was commanded by som of the Council of State to give them my at∣tendance and humble advice about removing the obstruction of the Mint, and to attend som honorable Gentlemen, who were to draw a table of the just value of all the Coins in Christendom, and to settle their true values according to the Standard of the Mint in the Tower of London, and what those Coins will make in our Mint beeing full weight; a great part of that work is already don, and a mo∣del drawn for the taking away the obstructions of the Mint in the Tower of London, and when the
 Parlament and Council of State pleas to command, it will bee perfectly finished; having this opportuni∣tie with somof the Council of State, I was comman∣ded by som of them to draw them such Observations concerning Trade, as I did conceiv might bee for the benefit of the Common-wealth, the increas of Trade, and the increas of Shipping. And though I knew my own insufficiencie for so weightie a business, and that there were many hundred in Lon∣don more able to do this then my self; yet conside∣ring that now God had put into my hands an oppor∣tunitie that I might present my self to the Council of State, and to the Nation in general, that I was not such a man as som maliciously had charged mee to bee, which was, that I was a Malignant, and one dis-affected to the present Government, as it is now settled, without King and Lords. I saie, to give a clear testimonie of the falsness of that ma∣licious charge against mee, I was willing to obey the commands of som of the Council of State, and did with all humilitie present to my Lord President and som of the Council of State, most of these Pro∣positions, for their private use, and they were ho∣norably pleased to accept of my endeavors, and gave mee their approbation of them, as a great ser∣vice offered by mee to the Common-wealth, wherein I did deserv all encouragement, and that the State would see to put many of them in execution; which noble favor of theirs, far beyond my imagination
 and desert, hath everlastingly obliged mee to their service, to studie alwaies to advance the interest and prosperitie of the present Government of this Com∣mon-wealth, as it is now settled, without King or Lords, to the uttermost of my power, and to the last drop of bloud I have, against any person or per∣sons whomsoëver, that endeavor the damage or un∣dermining of the present Government.
Now my request is to all the worthie Mer∣chants of this Nation, that som of them would bee pleased to take this argument into their hands, and what I have said undigestedly, and without a me∣thod, they with a more learned pen would perfect for the service of the Nation in general. Most of these Papers are transmitted down to the Hono∣rable Council of Trade, by an order of the Coun∣cil of State, and referred to their judicious conside∣ration. And the true reason of my printing of them is, that som more learned pen might finish what I have roughly begun; and whosoëver doth it, would do a great service to the Common-wealth. And for the Merchant-strangers that live and inhabit in any part of this Nation, my request to them all is, That they would consider of what I have here presented in their behalfs, and that they would all contribute their advice and reasons for the perfect∣ing of what is by mee humbly propounded, and so to carrie themselvs in all their actions, that no just ex∣ceptions may bee laid to their charge of beeing pre∣judicial
 Instruments either to the present Govern∣ment, or that any of their dealings should bee dis∣advantageous to the prosperitie and commerce of this Nation; but that they in humble requital of the Parlament's Protection, which they all enjoie equally with the Natives of this Nation, would bee pleased to studie all waies and means for the setting of such Manufactures here, as they know is made beyond Seas, for employing our shipping, for contributing their humble advice in repairing our Havens and Harbors, for dreining of our Lands, for employing of our poor, for setting up the Fish∣ing Trade, for making our Sea-Port-Towns their store-houses of Corn, and for laying a foundati∣on of bringing in their rich commodities from all parts of the world into our Ports and Harbors of England, wee having far better and securer Har∣bors then our Neighbors. And for their enabling them to do this, that they would humbly propound to the Parlament and Council of Trade, the best means and waies they conceiv all these things may don; whereof one of the principal waies is, to have free Ports in this Nation, to Import and Tran∣sport all Forrain goods Custom-free, that is not spent in this Nation; and for their settling of a bank in London, and settling of a cours of Bils of Exchange in several Sea-Port-Towns of this Nation; and for the settling of a Court of Mer∣chants in London, to determine all differences
 amongst Merchants. If they would studie these things, and all others they know, which would conduce to the profit and honor of this Common∣wealth, and would shew themselves openly that they are publick spirited men, they would Petition the Parlament, and Council of Trade, in these parti∣culars; and when they are required by those in Autoritie, would contribute their best reasons and advices clearly, without any by-ends, justly, and according to the great experience many of them have by their knowledg of business of trade in other Countries. This would bee a great service to the Nation in general, and it is no more then I think is their dutie to do, and I humbly conceiv the State exspect's from them, they should do.
And that all Merchants would present un∣to the State, what new Customs and Imposts have been laid on the English Nation in Forrain parts, more then was formerly laid; that so, if our Merchants cannot procure a redress them∣selvs beyond seas, the State; upon the Mer∣chant's Petition, might by their Letters or other waies, to Forrain States, take notice of it, and see our Merchants to have right; and this is usual in Holland, upon the least obstruction of trade, or intrenching upon the Merchants; the States General make it matter of state, and ei∣ther by force or by treatie, remove the obstruction, as all men know, that are acquainted with their
 proceedings between the King of Denmark and them, for Customs in the Sound, and the Por∣tingals and them in the East and West-Indies, and in their other transactions with other Prin∣ces and States; their principal care is, to take off the obstructions of Trade, I praie God all just and fair-dealing Merchants with us, may have the like and greater countenance and protection from the State, then their Merchants have in Holland. And whereas the Merchant-stran∣gers in London, have exacted on them several fees more then is conceived to bee by Law, that these Merchant-strangers would petition the State, that the Citie of London bee required to bring in forthwith the tables of fees for Package, Sca∣vage, and all other duties they can by Law just∣ly and anciently demand of the Merchant-stran∣gers. And that a certain rule may bee set up up in Printed tables in the Custom-Houses, what fees shall bee taken for the future. And that such Officers that have formerly exacted more monie of the Merchants, then their just fees, may bee compelled to restore the monie back to the Mer∣chants. And if the State reliev Merchant∣strangers here, it will bee a great Load-stone to other States and Nations to do all right to our Merchants beyond Seas.
But for those men, either English or stran∣gers, (I will not honor them with the name of
 Merchants) that are Transporters of Wool, Fuller's Earth, Horses, Gold and Silver, or any other prohibited goods, to the weakning and impoverishing of this Nation; and all such as have culled and melted down the heavie Monie of this Nation into Ingots, and sold it to such as have Transported it, or to such as have made Gold and silver Wier, and silver Thread, and such as have couzened the Common-wealth by buying up the light and clipped English silver Coin, and vented it again to Graziers or pub∣lick Cashiers, or any other persons, to the great deceit and damage of the Common-wealth; I shall leav them all to the Law, with this me∣mento to them, That as Justice is leaden-foot∣ed, yet shee hath iron hands; and though slow, yet shee is sure, and all ages have held men that do these things, as Moths and Cankers in a Common-wealth.
But for your just Merchant, hec is the Beau∣tie and Ornament of the Common-wealth, a great pillar in any Nation where they remain; and that State or Common-wealth that doth not love and protect them, must at long running bring them∣selvs to povertie. For mee to speak of the worth and dignitie of fair-dealing-Merchants in all ages, is to hold a Candle to the Sun; onely my praier to God shall bee, that their numbers may bee encreased in this Nation, and all encourage∣ment
 given them by the State, that they may have good Convoie to guard their ships, both outwards and inwards, from Pirats and Rovers; and if it bee the chance of any Merchant-men to meet with Pirats, that God would strengthen their sea-men, and give them valiant and loial hearts to fight for their Countrie, and their Merchant's ships and goods; and after their deliverance from Pirats, God's protection go along with them all, and bring them everie one to his desired Port; and at the end of our daies, bring us all to the bles∣sed Harbor of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this shall bee the praier of
