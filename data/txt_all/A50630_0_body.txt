May it please your Excellency,

NO Indian Ore, of precious stones, or gold,
Have I to give, or if I had? you would
Not value such, my gift gives greater price,
First welcoms you, then gives you good advice,
Within few words, and lo my lines do bring
Vnfeign'd affection, that's a sacred thing.
I also offer by some things I add,
A fair forewarning to debar the bad,
But how the bad shall from the better be
Discern'd, that secret lies asleep with me.
If things ensue, which here I seem to smother?
Say that a fool said so when you came hither.
I honour you, and wish your welfare too,
And (if commanded) I know what to do.
But for the present pray (Great Sir) proceed,
Vievving your vvelcome, venture then to read,
What more I say, and so I shall bring on
The vvelcome vvith this Dedication.
But left it be abus'd by base objection,
I publish it upon my Lords protectionâ–ª
For unto vvhom should I such duty do,
Were I an Ovid onely unto you,
Whose valour weighs with Cesars, and I say,
Exceeds by so much as is seen to day.
That prosperous Pompeius too in power,
You parallel in pomp this present hour.
Nations and cities in's days he did subdue,
And so the same sure shall be said of you.
He gain'd Armenia, Medeia, and Celicia,
Mesopotamia, Raphlagonia, Cappadocia,
But all by force, your Excellence not so,
You gain by fairness wheresoe're you go,
Nor are your fortunes, nor your actions either,
One jot inferiour to Pompeius neither.
Great treasures did his Victories transport
To Rome: so could you also, Sir, in short
Do (of your own to Dublin) and transcend
The pomp for which they Pompeius commend;
For he but conquer'd Kingdoms, purchas'd fame,
And you compare with Pompeius in them.
But then to put more pomp upon your plenty,
Weigh with your Welcome Verbum sapienti.
