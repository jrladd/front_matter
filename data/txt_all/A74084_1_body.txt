My Lord,
ITs very probable, that the sight of this Epistle will pos∣sesse you with a double wonder, first that your servants, or rather slaves, the Commons, should be preferred be∣fore you, and then, that such a subject as this should be De∣dicated to you; to the first I answer, that I have but con∣formed my selfe to your practise, for if the Subject may be preferred above the KING, well may the servant before the Master. And to the second I answer, that I know no man fit∣ter to patronize this work then your selfe, who is the Ring∣leader of the greatest, most horrid, and Bloudy Rebellion, that ever was managed in any Age of the world, and have committed and countenanced such execrable and damna∣ble Acts, as the most Barbarous Rebell that ever drew a Sword in the most barbarous and Heathenish Age, would have blushed and trembled at the Relation thereof. My Lord, you must excuse me, if like a skilfull Chirurgion, I throughly lanch the festred wounds of your guilty Con∣science which is laden with ingratitude, breach of Faith, Perjury, Murder, Rebellion, and Regicide. Me thinkes, that if the principles of Loyalty and Conscience could not, yet those of gratitude, (ingratitude being a sinne so much abhorred by the very Heathens, that they esteemed it worthy of death) might have prevailed with you, to have been so far frō drawing your sword in Rebellion, that you would have turned it into the brests of Rebels. That Title
of Honour which you now enjoy (For your Additions, are rather the stiles of shame and infamy, then of Honour and Renowne, was, by His Majesty, conferred upon your Noble Grand-father; who undoubtedly so abhorred Rebel∣lion, that had he known what Vipers he had to his Sonne and Grand-sonne, he would not onely have made you the heires of his curses, but have loathed his very Loyns for be∣getting such a pestilent Issue; the same King that conferred on your Family the Honour of Lordship, begirt you like∣wise with the Sword of Knighthood: which high favour you have ingratefully rewarded with the losse of the Donors life: It were but vaine for me to refresh your memory by re∣peating your Oath of Allegeance and Supremacy, and your Protestation, which you have most palpably broken by taking up Armes against your Soveraigne, and killing and slaying His most faithfull and Loyall Subjects, but even your Solemne League and Convenant, and that so∣lemne ingagement which you and your Commanders gave His Majesty upon your Honours at Newmarket, and ratified with Vowes and Oathes, that you would settle His Majesty in His Throne with security, and Honour to Himselfe and His Posterity; which your have most basely and dishonourably broken; For it was you, My Lord, that signed that Remonstrance, and sent it with your mi∣natory letter to the Houses, wherein you desired, or ra∣ther commanded, that His Majesty, whom your un∣mannerly language stiled the Grand & Capitall Enemy of this Nation, might be brought to slaughter, which you mis-called Justice. In conclusion, although as Pilate once did, so you would now wash your hands from the guilt of your Soveraigns innocent bloud, yet you and your Sectarian Army are certainly guilty of that barbarous Murder, which was a cruell Execution, an inhumane
cruelty, a brutish immanity, a devilish brutishnesse, and an hyperbolicall, yea, an hyperdiabolicall devilishnesse, so that what cursed Shimei did once as a reproach falsly cast upon David, the blessed people of God may justly throw upon you, and say, Thou man of Bloud: And now My Lord, having searched your wounds, and, I hope, let forth the corruption; I will prescribe you a method of cure, which must be by applying the plaister of Repentance to them; and washing your bloud-stained Conscience with the teares of Contrition, For which end onely, I protest that I, who cannot honour your Family for your sake, yet cannot but honour you for your Families sake, have Dedica∣ted this little book to your Lordship; hoping that when you read the successe of former Rebellions, your Lorship will repent of yours, and performe the Oath to the Sonne which your sware to His Father: in doing whereof, you will remove that cloud of Bloud which darkens the ancient splendour of your Noble Family, and pay the debt which you owe to the Kingdome for their ruine in making them to become your debters for the restauration to right; and your Lorship and we be at once happy, in living quietly, and Religiously under the peaceable Government of our Grati∣ous King CHARLES the Second, whom God pre∣serve.
VALE.
