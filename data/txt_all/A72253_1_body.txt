FOr as much as some yeeres since (Right Wor∣shipfull) it pleased you so courteously to accept that Sermon, which at your request I then pub∣lished, as concerning The fruites of our repentaunce towardes God; wherein Dauid Psal. 1. doth place The chiefest blessednesse and felicitie of man: I haue thought good to adde thereunto this Ser∣mon, which I made at the same Church (where you, and others, Iustices & Gentle∣men

were assembled on the ninth of Iuly last past) vpon a part of the first Lesson, by the order of our Church ap∣poynted for that Sabboth, as concerning that duetifull contentment of minde which (as good subiects) we owe all to our Prince and Countrey; that as in the first we are put in remembrance of our duetie towards the Lord of Lords, and Prince of Princes: so in this other, as well we which vttered and heard it, as others into whose handes it shall come to be read, may be ad∣monished of those loyall affections which we ought continually to beare to our mo gracious Soueraigne, and our established Common-wealth. As I am well assure that these affections are, and haue alway bin throughly setled in your faythful hartes; so I doubt not, but ye are also a fully desirous, that by this slender labour and by all meanes possible, others may be allured & drawen to the like disposition▪ Thus hoping that you will as louing

accept the reading and publishyng, as you haue already done the hearing, I com∣mit this my short Discourse to your Wor∣shippes, and you and it to the bles∣sing of the Almightie. From Tondridge this .xij. of Iuly. 1598.
