TRVTH is so
much the Center
of the Spirit of
Man, as it pre∣tends
to moue
towards it, euen in all the
digressions & Deuiations it
makes from it. For euen most

of our Errors & Delusions
passe themselues vpon vs vnder
the notion of Truth. The Spirit
of Falsity disguiseth himself in∣to
the Apparēce of an Angel of
Light to haue the easier accesse.
Did not Pilate himself seeme
desirous to know Truth, when
he inquired of our Sauiour
what Truth was?Io. 18. v. 38. But most
inquier like him; as soone as
menaced with this terror, if
you receaue it, you are no freind
to Caesar,Io: 19. v. 12. you incurre the dis∣pleasure
of the State, and the
Penalty of the Laws, they de∣cline
the further persute of
Truth, and shrinke into that
weakenes, which our Sauiour
reproached to his timorous in∣quirers;Io. 12. v. 43.
they lou'd the Glory
before Men, more then the
Glory before God.
Others there are, who seeme
frighted, as the children of
Israël were, with the misre∣ports
of the inhahitants of the
land of Chanaan, which were
falsely represented to them as
Gyants and Monsters; for so
their Pretending Explorators
disguise to them the Roman-Catholique
Religion vnder the
Forged figures of Idolatry, or
Superstitiō, to diuert an inquiry
into the true state and consti∣tution
of it. But as when Io∣suah
shew'd the children of
Israël a true and sensible
parcel of the fruits of that
earth, they were disabused,
and inflamed with a desire to
partake of the blessed fertility
of the land of promise: so, Godbe
praised, there are many, who
vpon an equal & ingenuous

view of the true and natural
state of Catholique Doctrine,
are disabused, and protest a∣gainst
the false reporters, as the
Psalmist did in reiection of
vaine inuentions of the Hea∣thens;Ps. 118. v, 85 & 86.
Narrauerunt mihi ini∣qui
Fabulationes; sed non vt
lex tua. Omnia mandata tua
Veritas. Vniust men make
their own storys; but what
they say is not like thy law.
All thy commandements are
Truth.
Here is therefore a true &
naturall parcel of the fruits of
that land of promise, (the
Church of CHRIST) to which
this blessed promise was made,
that it should be led into all
Truth,Io. 16. 13. and that CHRIST
IESVS the founder of it would
remaine with it vnto the endMat. 28. v, 20.

of the world. This promise
can not be verified in any
Church, which hath had a
notorious deficiency and inter∣ruption
for many ages, whi∣ch
marke of inconformity to
CHRIST'S figure and des∣cription
of the True Church,
is euident in all the Preten∣ded-Reformations.
But the designe of this Au∣thor
was, only a short & ea∣sy
exposure of such Catholique
Doctrines as the beleefe there∣of
is fully sufficient to render
the professor an intire & Or∣thodox
Catholique; so that this
short Treatise may be call'd
rather a Factum of the case,
then Pleading of the cause,
since it doth but singly expose
the matter of Fact in all our
Beleefs, whithout any Argu∣ing

against the opposite Opi∣nions.
Whereupon I may not im∣properly
say this is a true pi∣cture,
by the life, of Catho∣lique
Religion, which designeth
only a iust and natural repre∣sentation
of it, not a character
that raiseth & beautifyeth the
figure it exposeth.
And in conformity to this
profession, the pious and pru∣dent
Author declareth in the
close of this discourse, that it
was designed only for a Faith∣full
Manifest in the name of
the Catholique Church; the
vtility whereof was expected
in the disabusing all ingenuous
Readers in those misreported
Doctrines, which are wrong∣fully
imputed to her. And God
hath bless'd this pious proposall

so, as to recommend it very
notoriously by the satisfaction,
which is profess'd to haue bin
receaued by one of the most
considerable persons of this age,
for the honour of his Birth, and
eminency of all sorts of Me∣rit:
he hath acknowleged much
of his cleer & full information
of the Catholique Doctrines,
as receaued from this excellent
discourse.
And surely I haue not seen
any edition of this nature, as
may be more aptly call'd a
Mapp of Catholique Reli∣gion;
for all the lesser Contro∣uersies
are marked out in very
smale points & touches; but
the two Capital seates are dis∣tinguish'd
by some larger mar∣kes,
which represent them;
so you will find the Reall Pre∣sence

of CHRIST in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist,
and the Sacrifice of the Masse,
as being the Capitall sea∣tes
of our Controuersies, ex∣tended
in a much larger figure,
then the other questions; and
the drawing these two figures,
at their full length, & with
their true features, was the
most requisit application, by
reason they are the most as∣persed
& disfigured by the
Maligners of the Church.
And these two Articles
rightly understood, as they are
profess'd and explain'd in this
Treatise, may promise the re∣moue
of the greatest difficultyes,
which most frequently auert
many ingenuous & candid
Protestants from entring into
an equal & impartial inquiry,

concerning the seeming dif∣ficultyes
of these two points,
namely this of the Reall Pre∣sence
of CHRIST'S Body
and Blood in the Blessed
Sacrament of the Eucharist,
as pretending its not being
cleerly explained; and likewise
the Controuersy about the Sa∣crifice
of the Masse, as not
appearing euidently specified
in holy Scripture.
Me thinks these two may
not be improperly resembled
to the two great pillars of
brasse, call'd Booz and Iachin,
supporting the gates of the
Temple of Salomon; where∣fore
these two points are sett
at their full length, solidly
founded, and fairely polished
by a cleer smoothing, and ex∣plication
of the seeming harde∣nes

of those proposalls, which
were taken as a hard saying
coming euen out of CHRIST'S
own mouth,Jo▪ 6. v. 61. but if rightly
vnderstood, following this Au∣thor's
faire exposition, they
will be acknowleged, as our
Sauiour himself attested of
them,Jo. 6. v. 64 Verba quae ego locu∣tus
sum vobis Spiritus & vita
sunt. The words that I haue
spoke vnto you, they are
Spirit and they are life.
And can there be imagined
a greater Blessing, next to the
Beatifical Vision, then the Re∣all
Participation of the Body
and Blood of our Divine Sa∣uiour
IESVS-CHRIST? Me
thinks that which would haue
bin the wish of all zealous
Christians, if it had not bin
the free guift and grati∣fication

of God, is this Reall
Partaking, euen in this life
of this blessed cōmunication, by
which we may glory with S.
Peter,2. Pet. 1. v. 4. that by this precious
promise we are made parta∣kers
of the Diuine Nature.
And surely I haue not seen
any worke vpon this designe
wherein these two corner∣stones
of the Catholique Church
haue a more solid foundation,
or that affords a more easy
comprehension of these two su∣blime
mysteries.
By this motiue I haue bin
perswaded to passe into my
Country this forrein commo∣dity,
which like a delicate
wine of the same place, may
loose somewhat of the natural
Spirit & quicknes by the trans∣port,
yet I may presume that
it retaineth all these health∣full

and cordiall qualities it
had in the natiue production.
And hauing heretofore
presented my Country in
their seuerall seasons Spring-Flowers,
and other Summer-Fruits,
as the Parfumes of Poe∣sy,
and the Reflection of Mo∣rality,
now in this winter of
my age I transport to my na∣tion
this Riper and more whole∣some
fruit, the feeding where∣on
(contrary to the effect
denounced against the forbid∣den
fruite) may produce life
euerlasting.
Vpon which hope I may
summon my Country in that
call of our Lord IESVS, com∣manded
to be written by S.
Iohn, He that hath eares to
heare,Apoc. 2. let him heare what
the Spirit saith to the Chur∣ches▪;

for that (with greife
I say it) the reproach of the
Prophet Esay may be so truly
applied to our Nation,Esay. 50▪ v 11. Behold
you kindle a fire, and com∣passe
your selues about with
sparkes, and walke in the
light of your fire, and in the
sparkes that you haue kindled.
The strange diuersity of Sects,
and Severall professions of Re∣ligion
doth too euidently appro∣priate
this reproach of the Pro∣phet;
wherefor the rest of my
life shall be assigned to sol∣licite
God for the blessing
of the Primitiue Christians
vpon our so deuided Country to
be Cor Vnum, and Via Vna
One Hart & One Way.Act. 4. Y. 32. This
Vnity was the most feruent
prayer we find that our Sa∣uiour
euer made to his Father

for his Church left vpon earth,Io. 17. 11. & 21.
that they may be One, as
we are One. In order to some
contribution to this Blessed
Vnion I haue made this pre∣sent
to my Country, and
with great sense of Hart; for
whose Good & Happinesse
the Syncerity of my zeale is
such, that I perswade my self
I may expresse it in S. Paul's
offer for his Conuerts,2. Cor. 12. v. 15. Ego
autem libentissimè impen∣dam,
& Superimpendar ipse
pro animabus vestris. I most
gladly will bestow, and will
my selfe moreouer be besto∣w'd
for your soules.
And now giue me leaue to
closevp this address to my Coun∣try
in the words of our Lord
IESVS,Apoc. 2. 5. which S. Iohn hear'd
directed to the Bishop of Ephe∣sus,

Remember from whence
thou art fallen, and repent,
and doe thy first workes. For
which blessed resipiscence shall
be zealously offer'd all the days
of my life the best of all the
Religious offices, and priuate
deuotions of
