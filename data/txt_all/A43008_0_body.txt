My Lord,
ALthough the interval of several years past might easily have blotted out the memory of any Obli∣gations, yet it is the impression of your Lordships most obliging civilities conferred upon me, when fortune had blessed me with the honour of your good company in my Travels in France, that incites me to make the least recompence (yet the greatest within my power) of their remembrance and acknowledgement. But what can this add? Since Countries and Cities, that have been

honoured with your abode, describe your fame with Characters of all perfections concurring in a Person of so Noble, Prudent, Valiant, Heroick, and so Affable a Spirit: Whence I cannot but be confirmed of your Lordships Candour, that encourageth me in this my enterprize of offering to you a piece of Philoso∣phy, so much below your acceptance; however questioning not but that your Honours endowments will raise the use of it (if any may be made) to the greatest height. And now being conscious of my presumption in aspiring to make choice of so eminent a Personage for a Patron, do humbly beg your Pardon, and the favour of subscribing my self
Most Noble Sir,
