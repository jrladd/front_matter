SIR,
THat which Sa∣lomon
teacheth
in that one A∣phorisme
of∣ten
repeated; wanted not ap∣parent

weight and moments
of reason: saying, that in the
prosperity of the righte∣ous,Pro. 11. 10. and 29. 2. the Citie reioyceth:
for God being in couenant with
them, for their sakes doth good
to such, as are ioyned in the
same society with them: for
one Ioseph all Potiphers
house was blessed; and for one
Paul, all that are in the ship
with him are saued: yea, good
and vertuous men by their
presence, as Lot in Sodome;
by their prayers, as Moses in
the breach; and by their pru∣dent
Counsell, as that poore
wise man,Eccl. 9. 15. withstand the iudg∣ments
of God, and saue the
Citie: for had there beene
found one good man, all Ie∣rusalem
had beene spared for
his sake. Againe, vertuous

men aduanced, will conferre
all their honour and grace to
the publike good: they liue
not to themselues and theirs,
but take in the Church and
Common-wealth,. as fellow-Commoners
of all their good∣nesse.
Mordecaies autho∣rity
wrought publike deliue∣rance
to the whole Church,
and Iosephs aduancement
sustained the whole land, by
opening the garners in time of
famine. The honour of one
good man shall be the grace of
all good men; his power the
strength of many; his great∣nesse
the raising of many: as
when one Mordecai is rai∣sed,Esse 8. 6
light, and ioy, and glad∣nesse,
and honour, came to all
the Iewes. Further, good men
honoured by God, will honour

God againe, and withstand his
dishonour: they will (to their
power) prouide that Gods wor∣ship
be erected, that his Sab∣baths
be sanctified, that true
religion be maintained, that
falsehood and errors be sup∣pressed,
that publike peace be
not disturbed, that common
iustice be not peruerted, least
Gods fauour be discontinued,
and his iudgements let in.
Whence they are to be estee∣med
the strongest towers,Sine pis cetulex murus re∣bus seruan∣dis par est the
thickest wals, the most im∣pregnable
forts, the surest
muniments, and the stoutest
horsemen and Chariots of
their Countrey: yea, the Wise
man in one word saith much
more,Pro. 10. 25. Iustus fun∣damentum mundi. that the Righteous is
a sure foundation, vphol∣ding
the whole world.

But why write I this, or to
your Honour? surely as one
who euer reuerenced your wor∣thy
parts. I could not but
craue leaue to expresse my selfe
one of the Citie, reioysing
and praising God in your ho∣nours
prosperity and aduance∣ment:
and the rather, because
my selfe was an eye-witnesse
how God led you through some
of your yonger yeeres, which
were so studiously and com∣mendably
passed, as this your
latter time fitly answereth
that expectation which was
then conceiued of you.
You were then deare to our
common mother that famous
Vniuersity of Cambridge;
which for your eloquence and
grace of speech and perswasi∣on,
appointed you her Orator:

for your wisdome and graui∣ty
in gouernment, chose you
her Procter: for your sound∣nesse
in all kinde of fruitfull
and commendable litterature,
tendred you all her honors and
degrees: and for your sober,
studious, and vertuous con∣uersation
worthily held now
her great Ornament. And
now as riper for greater em∣ploiments,
the same God (whose
priuiledge it is to dispense pro∣motions,
for he pulleth downe
one and setteth vp another)
hath moued his Maiestie not
onely to set your seat among
the honouroble, but to admit
you (as it were) into his breast,
and betrust you with the se∣crets
of this great state and
Kingdome: an office not more
ancient then honourable, be∣fitting

onely men of rarest
wisdome, fidelity, and fitnesse
to stand before so great, so wise
a King. This was a most ho∣nourable
office among the most
ancient Kings of Israel: for
King Dauid had his two prin∣cipall
Secretaries,2 Sam. 8. 17 Seraiah
and Iehonatham,2 Chro. 27. 32. whom the
text commendeth for a man
of counsell and vnderstan∣ding:
and King Salomon
his sonne had other two, Eli∣horeph
aud Ahiah,1 King. 4. 3 who
were in chiefe place neere the
King. Wee read also of
Shebna,2 Kin. 18. 1 principall Secretary
to King Hezekiah, of whom
Iunius saith; he was fecun∣dus
à rege. Now your place
being a seruice of such honour
vnder his Maiestie, cannot
be without an answerable

waight and charge. Your Ho∣nour
easily conceiueth that the
Lord chargeth you with a
chiefe care of honouring him,
who hath honoured you: that
you stand charged to his Ma∣iesty
with great trust and fi∣delity:
that the Church ex∣pecteth
that by your authori∣ty,
you should promote her
causes, and stand in the main∣tenance
of pure religion: that
the Common-wealth claimeth
her part in you, for the pre∣seruation
of peace within her
wals, and prosperity within
her palaces: that the Vniuer∣sity
looketh you should ad∣uance
her iust causes, promote
learning, and encourage her
students, by helping them in∣to
the roomes of the ignorant
and vnlearned Ministers:

in a word,Pro. 11. 11. that the whole
City hopeth to be exalted
by the prosperity of the
righteous.
And now if your Honours
thankefull heart shall call vp∣on
you, and say, Quid retri∣buam
domino? you will ea∣sily
fal into frequent thoughts
and desires,Tota vita Christiani anctum desiderium est. Aug. in Ioh. tract 4. of discharging all
this expectation. This shall be
happily done, if you shall chuse
about you the wisest Counsel∣lors,
for the happy and pru∣dent
carriage of your great af∣faires,
imitating herein that
peerelesse patterne of wisdome,
Salomon himselfe, who not∣withstanding
his extraordi∣nary
measure of wisedome,
chose vnto himselfe, selectis∣simum
senaum, a bench of
most wise and graue Counsl∣lours,

whose counsell Reho∣boam
after despised. The best
counseller is that great
Counsellour,Esa. 9. who is daily to
be consulted by feruent praier.
The next is the word of God,
which as it giueth no lesse cer∣taine
direction in difficult ca∣ses,
than the Oracle did vn∣to
Israel, or then did the pil∣lar
of the cloud, and of fire by
day and night for their moti∣on
or station, while they pas∣sed
through the wildernesse:
so the daily consulling with
Gods statutes, by reading and
meditation (as with so many
learned counsellours) made
holy Dauid wiser than the a∣ged,Psa. 119. 98 99, 100.
than the learned, than
the Princes, than his aduer∣saries.Iosh. 1. 8.
And if Ioshuah would
prosper and haue good successe

in his high enterprises,. he must
keepe him to the Booke of
the Law, and not depart
from it. The feare of God is
wisedome, and the next wise∣dome
to that, is to conuerse
and consult with such as doe
feare God,Pro. 10. 32. whose lips speake
iust and good things: wher∣by
a man shal become both wi∣ser
and better. This is the
high way to attaine and re∣taine
grace and reputation
with God and good men; for
this is an inheritance not got∣ten
with greatnesse, but with
goodnesse: the former cannot
force or compell affections, the
latter sweetly drawes and al∣lures
them: the former may
procure flattery and applause,
the latter onely yeeldeth true
honour and sound comfort.

Might I adde but one grain
to your godly care, by this olit∣tle
direction, with which If ∣fer
my most inward affections,
I haue my expeation. I know
well your Honours sufficien∣cy,
euen in this kind, aboue
many of my profession, to fur∣nish
your selfe with diuine di∣rections,
if your leisure or
weighty affaires would permit
you to set them downe: yet I
assure my selfe, your Honour
will not refuse the helpe of
such, as are at more leisure to
gather them, and humbly of∣fer
them vnto your hand. I
was also more presumptuous to
offer these lines vnto your
view, because I conceiued that
the rules of Christian pru∣dence
and circumspection,
could not bee more sitly dire∣cted,

nor bee better welcome,
than to so prudent and cir∣cumspect
a parsonage. In
which assurance I rest, com∣mending
your Honours fur∣ther
happinesse and prosperity
to him, who is an exceeding
great reward, abundantly a∣ble
to fill your heart with
grace, to crowne your dayes
with blessing, and finish them
with comfort, life and immor∣tality.
