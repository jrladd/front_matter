Madam,
HAd I been affected with that Itching Humour of Ambition to raise an Obelisk to my Memory, and leave behind me some Tokens, that I once Liv'd, and had a Being and Existence upon Earth: How could I have contrived a more Glorious method for the Erecting this Eternal Monument, than by fixing Your Graces Name to these my poor weak Endeavours? For, who (seeing Your Honoured Name set before the Book,) will not be invited (by the Fairness of such a Frontispiece) to look into the Sermons, and even practice the Duties intimated therein?
Madam, I confess it high Presumption, and I hum∣bly beg your Graces Pardon for borrowing your Name and Patronage, because it looks like a design in me, that if there be no other worth in the Discourses, yet at least they may have the Virtues and Advantages of a Burning-Glass,
which borrowing a Flame from the Great Eye of Heaven, Shines and Burns, not of it self, but by the Rays and Emanations of its Bright Patron and Bene∣factor: I will not pretend to vindicate my self from so Holy a Suspition, though something more Enobled my Desires to present Your Grace with this humble Dedica∣tion: For I do confidently avow (not to Affront the Modesty so Innate to Your Temper, or come within the Sphere of Flattery, so repugnant to my Genius,) that the Noble Perfections wherewith Heaven hath Accom∣plished You, have render'd You so Publickly Acquainted to the World, that he must not only be a Stranger to him∣self, but even to all Humane Society and Converse, who converse, who have not been sensibly surpriz'd in the Admiration of Your Virtues: Virtues which you Suckled in even with Your Milk, and have Thrived with so day∣ly an Encrease in the Sequel of Your Life, that they might Justly Challenge Shrines and Altars from us, if Your Humility did not signifie unto us a Reprimand. These are such Truths, that I dare not proceed to say any thing further concerning your Graces Perfections, be∣cause it is impossible for me (had I the Tongue of An∣gels) to express my self in a method proportionable to my Theam. I might, it is possible, suggest and hint to pre∣sent and future Ages, that Your Natural and Particular Inclinations are those Virtues; yes, and in a much more Eminent Degree, which Deified far less Deserving Per∣sons:
Nay further, if some most Sweet and Angelical Tongue does not contrive some new Language to Posterity, wherein to Celebrate and Proclaim Aloud the Embellish∣ments and Graces wherewith Heaven hath Endowed You; it must Silently Content it self to Reverence the Name, and Adore the Memory of the most Virtuous and Illustrious Lady, MARY Dutchess of Beufort, with∣out presumption of Speech of Your Actions, because they transcend Expression as well as Imitation.
What need I to repeat the Immortality of Your Augu∣stick Family, the Sun shall sooner be displaced from its Orbe, the Stars forget their Motions, than Mankind forget to Celebrate the most Heroick, Loyal and Glorious Atchievments of the most Generous and Honourable Ca∣pel? And Madam, You being one of the Noble Branches proceeding from that Loyal Stem, to whom can I Ad∣dress my self more properly in a Sermon on the Thirtieth of January, then unto Your Grace? For not only Charles the First, but likewise the Honourable Capel fell Sacrifices to a Usurping Power, and both died Glorious Martyrs in Defence of Church and State.
May it please Your Grace then to accept these Dis∣courses, though presented by a mean Hand, for they are intended for no other purpose; then to convince unreason∣able and Wicked men of their Damnable and Hellish Practices against the Church and State, and what In∣defatigable Labours they Groan under to effect their
Diabolical Designs: But God grant that all our Nobi∣lity may Unanimously Resolve a perfest Conquest and Subjection of these Engineers of Satan and Builders of Babel, that the Peace and Happiness, Truth and Ju∣stice, Religion and Piety may be Establish'd amongst us and all succeeding Generations, which is Incessantly Pray'd for by
