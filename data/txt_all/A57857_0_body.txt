My Noble Lord,
I Have presumed to Prefix your Lordships Name to this Work, hoping that your Lordship will count it no dishonour for the Greatest of Men to Patronize the least of the Truths of GOD: and knowing your Zealous and Pious Concerns, as for the State, so for the Church of CHRIST, as now E∣stablished

in this Nation. My Design in this Dedication is not to seek the Rulrs Favour: having had for many Years, the Honour to be more Regarded by Your Lordship than ever I could deserve: nor to Engage your Lordship to own our Church against her open and secret Enemies; knowing how steadily you have appeared for the True Interest of the Church, and of the Nation, In utraque fortuna; and how fixed your Principles are with respect to both. But what I aim at is, to express the true Sense I have (as I know my Brethren also to retain) of your Lordships Wisdom, Zeal, and Fortitude, encountering the Greatest of Hazards, and enduring the most grie∣vous of Hardships, for that Holy Religion that ye Profess; and for the Liberties of your Native Countrey. The eminent Post your Lordship is now in, as it is a Token of your Princes Favour, and His Majesties Wise Choise of a sit Instrument for High and diffi∣cult Work; So it is the LORD'S Reward for your hard Services; and his giving you the Opportunity to do him further Service, of another Sort: and his Trying you whether ye will Eye GOD'S Glo∣ry above all things (when ye have the Occasion, and Temptation of seeking your own Things) as ye did when ye Ventured, and lost your All in this World for him. GOD expecteth that ye will now Pay your Vows made in your Trouble; and that ye will be singly, and actively for him: the Time is short wherein we can Walk or Work, and Occasions are uncertain. There will be great Peace in Reflection (when our Work is at an end) on sincere Endea∣vours, and Application of Mind, to the Work that the LORD hath put in our hand. That the LORD may long Preserve your Lordship, and continue your Capacity to do Him Service, and that he may Blessyour Noble Family with His best Blessings, is the earnest prayer of,
Edinburgh, December, 20, 1697.
My Noble Lord,
