GENTLEMEN,
THE meanest of you may claime so much, and the greatest of you is not disparaged by that lowest Title of Genti∣litie. Without you, we must confesse, not any in our Gouernment (which the Lord in his Mercy grant long to flourish) continueth or recouereth a certainty in his Estate Temporall, as you doe and will, I hope acknowledge, that you your selues attaine to, and finde comfort in, that certainty of your future well-fare by the Mi∣nistery, which as a Conduit pipe conuaies it to you from the Sacred Word,
Es. 12.3. that Well of Salua∣tion. The greater your care is for establishing others or your selues in terrestriall endowments, the greater corasiue it is to the Conscience, if it be not paralelld with an equall measure of studie and endeuour to gather assurance of your owne Coelestiall inheritance: & the more expence, wit, strength and time is imployed about vsing the
meanes to dispossesse intruders vpō others or our owne right, the deeper is the heart wounded, if some expence, wit, strēgth & time be not set apart for the wresting out of the hands of the truthes ad∣uersaries those weapons whereby they goare the same & in gulfe the Soule. What I haue done to iu∣stifie the point of the Communitie of the Saints assu∣rance, and to remoue an vncertaine doubting of Gods loue in Iesus Christ I referre (as my selfe also) to the censures and acceptations of you, a∣mong some of whom I haue sometime liued, and whom I haue found alwaies both iudicious and generous: Praying, that you may all be so fre∣quent and expert in the Law of man, that you Day and Night meditate vpon the Law of the Lord,
Psal. 1.2. to your internall Peace here, and eternall Conso∣lations for euer
