SIR,
BEpleased to cast a gracious eye upon this Book, and at Your leasure (if Your Royall imployments lend you any) to peruse it.
In Your Three Kingdoms, You have three sorts of people: The first, confident and faithfull; The second, diffident and fearfull; The third, indifferent and doubt∣full.
The first are with You in their Per∣sons, Purses, (or desires) and good wishes.
The second are with You neither in their Purses, nor good wishes, nor (with their desires) in their Persons.

The third are with You in their good wishes, but neither in their Persons, nor Purses, nor Desires.
In this Booke, these three sorts are re∣presented in three Persons, and presented to the view of Your Sacred Majesty.
You shall find them as busie with their Penns as the Armyes are with their Pi∣stols: How they behave themselves, let the People judge: I appeale to Cesar. Your Majesties honour, safety and prospe∣rity, The Churches Truth, Unity, and Uniformity, Your Kingdomes Peace, Plenty and Felicity, is the continued ob∣ject of his Devotion, who is
SIR,
