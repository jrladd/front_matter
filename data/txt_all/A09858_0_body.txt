My singular good Lord:
REtreats from the World are settings forward for Heauen, And since it is now so rare a fashion, to haue many Associates: in such extrauagancies; me thinks their diuine Solitudes (or Desolations) should be pleased with presentment of diuine Consorts. God himselfe is entitled to Musique, it being euen his owne spirits most sweet inspiration. For which cause I haue employed my best endeuours to serue your Honor in your sweet Solitari∣nesse (as Sir Philip Sydney cals the fruition of his owne) with my best abili∣tie; As well to expresse my true gratitude, for all your rare goodnesse in my attendance in Spaine; here and euery where, wherein your right Noble Fa∣mily hath bound me with most strong deseruings; As any hope in my vnwor∣thinesse to please you worthily. In regard your good Lordship hath heretofore beene feasted with the Choice Musiques of Christendome; whose Accents still sounding in your eares, must with all power of desert keepe out the desertlesse assaults, or Assayes of Entrie made by mine owne deficiencies. But because men many times (in curious feare to seeme partiall in sentence of their owne labours) are as many times scarce indifferent and equall; If any worth all in these my solicitous watches could obtaine lest passe to your Honors delight. I should be more glad to be now so deceiued; then euer I was sure of good speed in my most happie and successefull Ambitions.
And so rest euer your good Lordships,
