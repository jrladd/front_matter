Majesties feet, beseeching you to prosper such a blessed Reso∣lution,
till it attain success: We must needs beleeve, that when
your Majesty took our Consent to a Lyturgy to be a foundation
that would infer our Concord, you meant not that we should
have no Concord, but by consenting to this Lyturgy, without
any considerable Alterations.
And when you comforted us with your Resolutions to draw
us together, by yeelding on both sides in what we could, you
meant not that we should be the boat to lay the banks that

in particular, that none be punished or troubled for not using
the Common-Prayer, till it be effectually reformed, and the
Addition made, as there exprest. We crave your Majesties
Pardon for the tediousness of this Address, and shall wait in
hope, that so great a Calamity of your people as will follow
the loss of so many able, faithful Ministers, as the rigorous Im∣position
would cast out, shall never be recorded in the History
of your Reign, but that these impediments of Concord being
forborn, your Kingdom may flourish in Piety and Peace, that
this may be the signal honour of your happyReign, and your
joy in the day of your account, which is the Prayer of
