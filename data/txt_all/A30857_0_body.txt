May it please your Grace,
BEing prevail'd with by the Im∣portunity of that Society, at whose Request this plain Discourse was Preach'd, to make it Publick; out of a charitable belief that it might do some good; I presume to lay it at your Grace's Feet, not for any worth in the Composure, but for the sake of its useful Argument, The Reformation of Mens Manners.
The obtaining of which is a Work so necessary, so desirable and
 truly Excellent, that it deserves In∣couragement from all great and good Men. And your Grace having so zealously, and early appear'd at the Head of a Number of our Worthies both in Church and State, who have countenanc'd and promoted this Pi∣ous and Generous Design; to make the Nation better; I hope your Grace will not disdain this Mean, but well-intended Endeavours, to ad∣vance the same good End. And this, My Lord, was the true Reason, which induc'd me to lay hold of this Opportunity of acknowledging Pub∣lickly, how much I am
My LORD,
