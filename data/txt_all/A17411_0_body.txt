MADAM:
By reason of my Lords
absence, and your
Honors, a great part
of the yeare past, I
haue had more lei∣sure,
then I desired, & thereby oppor∣tunity
to write out my notes on the
first chapter of Peter, and not know∣ing
which way to testifie so fully as I
ought, my obseruance, and duty to your

Honor, or to satisfie the daily impor∣tunity
of many friends, I haue ad∣uentured
againe to come vnder the
Presse, that so (receiuing daily an in∣crease
of fauors from your Honor,)
I might thus publikely take occasion
to professe my vowes of seruice and
thankefulnes, beseeching your Honor
to vouchsafe the acceptation, protecti∣on,
and pervsall of this abridgement
of those Sermons, many of which your
Honor hath bin pleased to heare with
great attention. As for the desire
of many godly friends herein, I should
not haue bin easily inclined to harken
to it (the world abounding with books
euen to loathing) but that in writings
of this nature, and vpon this Epistle,
there is some want, and that I haue
receiued incouragement from the ac∣ceptation

of my former labours, and
that I know the matter herein contai∣ned
is wholesome, & not vnprofitable;
and besides hauing suffred an invo∣luntary
vacation in my weeke-daies
attendance in your Honors family,
and an extreame losse in the want of
diuers of my cheefe hearers, I was
resolued to try, whether I might be
helpfull to the Church of God abroad,
by such an imployment of my selfe in
the houres I could spare from my study
for the Lords day. My most hum∣ble
request to your Honor is, that you
would be pleased to grace these notes
with the liberty to passe vnder the
protection of your name, and fauour:
I should much reioyce, if the reading
hereof, may make any supply of my in∣termitted
seruice to your Honor, and
