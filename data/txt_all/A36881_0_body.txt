Honourable Sir,
THese Letters written fifty years ago to re∣duce the Duke of Bouillon to the Protestant Religion which he had forsa∣ken, never were put to the Press, for Fear of provo∣king that great Lord to con∣fute them with Arguments of Power, against which those of Truth and Learning too of∣ten
cannot stand. That they now come out in English, the Church of England is obliged, Sir, to you, who ha∣ving by your diligent Search made your self Owner of a fair Manuscript of the same, were pleased to bestow it upon me, the Authors Son; ad∣ding your Request, which to me is a Command, that I would translate it into Eng∣lish, and give it to the Pub∣lick. I have now obeyed your Order, which I could not have done in a more sea∣sonable Conjuncture, and I cannot in Duty but return
this Translation to the bounti∣ful Giver of the Original. Sir, you have by your excel∣lent Labours already publisht, shewn to the World how well you can match hearty Piety with eminent Learning. Now you are pleased to give ano∣ther Instance of your Affecti∣on to both, by procuring the setting forth these following Treatises. Short indeed they are, but as compact with the Sinews of Reason and Learn∣ing, as any that ever came from the Study of that strong Champion of Gods Cause. May God be glorified by it, his
Truth asserted, his Opposers converted, and your Zeal for Gods Truth and Glory be re∣warded by God, and imitated by men. So prayeth
SIR,
