THinking my worke as safe vnder your Patronage from carping, as Vlisses vnder the shield of Aiax, I haue entered my barraine Garden, and there gathered such greene flowers as so small a plotte affoordes: and because of the Spring-time I haue made them in a Graland, according to my promise to present you withall. Pardon my bran∣ches that buds but in Sommer with the Mulberie, for I am one of those Poets that came to Homers bason, to lap vp that hee dooth cast vp. It sufficeth me to be a water bough, not a top bud, so I may be of the same roote: to be yron, not steele, so I be of the same blade: Vinegar, not VVine, so I be of the same caske: to grinde colours for Apelles, though I can not garnish. I haue aduentured with the young VVrestler at the games of Olimpus to re∣ceiue a fall, or at least a foile; if I be pricked with a bram∣ble, Ile thrust my hand into the whole bush. VVhen Bu∣cephalus was paynted, Apelles craued but the iudgment of Alexander, whē Iupiter was carued, Prissius asked the censure of none but Lisippus; neither greatly craue I any but one, the Patroner of my pamphlet. Momus must mocke, the Serpent Porphirius is full of poyson, yet
 hurteth hee none but himselfe: the Hearbe Moly hath a flower as white as Snow, but a roote as blacke as Inke: the Palme-persian Fig-tree, beareth as well Apples as Figs: the Easterly winde maketh the blossomes to blast, and the buddes to blow, the Bee carrieth honey in her mouth, and a sting in her tayle: some disclose subtill se∣crets, that are the Authors of the same, and in touching others take themselues by the elboe. But the saying is, (Little sayd is soone amended,) Ile keepe a meane, and medle with no man, and though I be kissed with Hipar∣chion, or forbidden to sell wine with the Vintner in Ve∣nice, I will aduenture to put forth a Garland, & those that loue wines will commend my good will. Thus resting at his liking to whom I present my Garland, I end, resting at his commaund.
