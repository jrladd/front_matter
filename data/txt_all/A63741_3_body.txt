My Lord,
I Am not ashamed to profess that I pay this part of Service
to your Lordship most unwillingly: for it is a sad office to
be the chief Minister in a house of mourning, and to pre∣sent
an interested person with a branch of Cypress and a
bottle of tears. And indeed, my Lord, it were more proportionable
to your needs to bring something that might alleviate or divert your
sorrow, than to dress the Hearse of your Dear Lady, and to furnish
it with such circumstances, that it may dwell with you, and lie in your
Closet, and make your prayers and your retirements more sad and
full of weepings. But because the Divine providence hath taken
from you a person so excellent, a woman fit to converse with An∣gels
and Apostles, with Saints and Martyrs, give me leave to pre∣sent
you with her Picture, drawn in little and in water-colours,
sullyed indeed with tears and the abrupt accents of a real and con∣sonant
sorrow; but drawn with a faithful hand, and taken from
the life: and indeed it were too great a loss to be deprived of her
example and of her rule, of the original and of the copy too. The
age is very evil and deserved her not; but because it is so evil, it
hath the more need to have such lives preserved in memory to in∣struct
our piety, or upbraid our wickedness. For now that God
hath cut this tree of Paradise down from its seat of earth, yet so
the dead trunk may support a part of the declining Temple, or at
least serve to kindle the fire on the Altar. My Lord, I pray God
this heap of sorrow may swell your piety till it breaks into the
greatest joys of God and of Religion: and remember when you pay

a tear upon the Grave, or to the memory of your Lady (that Dear
and most excellent Soul) that you pay two more: one of repentance
for those things that may have caused this breach; and another of
joy for the mercies of God to your Dear departed Saint, that he hath
taken her into a place where she can weep no more. My Lord, I
think I shall, so long as I live, that is, so long as I am
