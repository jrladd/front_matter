THe second time doth my unworthy muse
Salute thy milde aspect thrise noble Knight,
Let gracious censure his defects peruse,
Whose Genius waites on thy heroicke spright,
Whose loue and life are bent to honour thee:
And whilest breath lasteth vse both them and mee.


These Poems which my infant labours send
As messengers of dutie to thine eares,
Are of small value, but if nature lend
Some perfect dayes to my unripened yeares,
My pen shall vse a more iudicious vaine,
And sing thy glory in a higher straine.
