SIR,
IF the Name of Stranger (a word in its ge∣nuine sence never despicable) do not deface the formality of this present Oblation, and put the to the expence of such an Apologie, as shall render me ruder then that Act which may be the object of my Accusation. I hope these imper∣fect mixtures of Fancy, may gain a liberty to approach the presence of your leisure, and attend the truce of your neore serious retirements. I dare not manifest the multiplicity of motives that have induced me to this uncustomary confidence, lest the representation of your own clear deser∣vings, cause me to be accused for flattery (a pra∣ctice,

which to me, is equally detestable with Re∣bellion, and Sacriledge:) Sir, you will, in this weak Volume, finde such a little Wilderness of vain Varieties, that you will think the Au∣thor was onely studious, to contrive an orderly Confusion. If any thing in it may be the object of your Approbation, I have an absolute accomplish∣ment of all my Expectations; how ever, I shall cherish my self with hopes to enjoy the benefit of your pardon, and have licence to subscribe my Ambition, in the honour of being
SIR, Your much devoted Servant:
THO: JORDAN.
