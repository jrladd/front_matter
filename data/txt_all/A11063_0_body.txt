I Neuer drunke of Aganippes Well:
I neuer sleept vpon Parnassus Hill.
Arcas I neuer heard, I haue not seene
Ioues daughters dance in the Pierian greene:
I leaue the Muses and the Delphick rockes
For those that beare green bayes, & weare high sockes.
I write no lofty stile, I'm plain & simple
For why I'dwell farre from Apollos Temple.
Yet Madam, Ipresume you'l not disdaine
To read these verses though they be but plaine.
For they containe sweet Meditations
And Antydots against tentatious
For you alone I made them, they are yours,
Then read them when you haue some idle houres.

Accept them as a token of that zeale
Which I doe carrie to your Honours weale.
Vnto your Husband, mirror of these times,
By right I should haue offed not these rimes
To whom I owe a greater obligation,
Then euer I did to any of our Nation,
But that I haue reserued greater straines
To him who hath deserued all my paines,
Whose vertues claime far more then now I will
Expresse to you, by this my rurall quill.
Because he hates vaine ostentation,
And I likewise hate assentation.
But to be briefe, according to our powers
My Muse and I, will honour you and yours.
