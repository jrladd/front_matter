My Lord,
IN obedience to the Order of your Court, I have publish'd this Sermon, and heartily pray it may have those good Effects for which it was both Preach'd and Publish'd: And having this Opportu∣nity, I beg leave to let Your Lordship know the grate∣ful sense all good men have of Your vigorous Care and Endeavours to give a stop to that Profaneness and Lewdness of Manners that are grown to so great a head amongst us. The Act of Parliament that gives Liberty to Dissenters in the use of their se∣veral Modes of Worship, was, I am sure, never design'd to give men liberty to have no Religion at
 all; and yet this I fear, as to too many, is the sad effect of it. It were to be wish'd that all men could be perswaded to woship God with one Mouth, and one Heart, after that most Excellent Form Establish'd in our Church, the Best and Purest of Churches; yet is it far better to worship God after any form, than not to worship him at all, than to live in an open neglect and contempt of his Wor∣ship. May Your Lordship go on, by Your own Ex∣ample, to encourage Regular and Uniform Devotion, and by a due Execution of the Laws, to suppress Irreligion and Immorality. This, Their Majesties have often declar'd, to be Their Will and Pleasure: By this Your Lordship will do the greatest Service to Their Crown and Government: This will not fail to procure the Blessing of God upon this great City, and secure to Your Lordshtp Peace and Honour both here and for ever. I am,
My LORD,
