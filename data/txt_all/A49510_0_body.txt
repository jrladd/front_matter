Most Honoured SIR,
THe World doth much call for this little worke of my Fathers, who is now with God. And the Communion of Saints being so great a part of our most holy Faith, I dare not keep it back from any Christian mans enjoyment; Yet it being a piece, which was formed in your service, while you were She∣riffe of Dorset-shire, I refuse to send it forth but with your cognizance, and under your Patronage. It is just, that having beene borne, as it were, in your house, it should not become the propertie of others,
without a speciall reserve of its chiefe ho∣mage unto your selfe. When it was prea∣ched to you from the Pulpit, it found your great acceptance: I hope it shall finde as great, now it salutes you from the Presse. And if it shall be still as welcome to your eye as it was then unto your eare, it will much encourage me to inherite as well my Fa∣thers affections to you as his name, and to let you see, that though he be dead, yet there is still alive
Most honour'd SIR,

From my Study in Mag. Coll. Oxon. Octob. 22. 1653.
