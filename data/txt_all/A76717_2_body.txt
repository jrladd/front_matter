SIR,
Benefits bestowed oblige the receiver, thanks returned engage the giver: by the first I am made hopeless of requital: by the second you will be the more encourag∣ed to continue your benevolence. To sup∣press the rememberance of favours is impi∣ous, Ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris; & to ex¦press them as I should is more then I can doe, and I know is more then you expect. Indeede though words (as it is in the Pro∣verbe) will butter no Parsnips, yet I con∣fess a verbal acknowledgment is somthing, and a partiall satisfaction better then none at all. This hath encouraged me to send you (as a test of my real thank fulness) these
 unfledgd birds; hatched (to say the truth) in the dark, and brought to light when I could see none (scalding Rheums and Di∣stilations for a great while togeather over∣clouding mine eye-sight) which may ren∣der their blemishes, wants, and imperfecti∣ons, a little the more pardonable and ex∣cusable, with the judicious; such a one I as∣sure my self you are, and therefore my humble Muse falling flat at the feet of your clemency, craves so much favour at your hands, that you would please to ho∣nor this tender Fry of hers, so far as to brood them under the wings of your pro∣tection; she bringing you them as a smal present-from, Sir,
Aug. 12. 1657.
