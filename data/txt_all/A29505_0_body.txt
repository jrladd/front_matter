Right Honourable,
THe Discourse which some time since you were pleased to honour me by your Commands of appearing before you with, was but a proof of a larger Trea∣tise concerning Prayer, not long before dispatch∣ed. It was then far from any design of pub∣lishing: but I since finding many things by me, and many more coming to my Mind not altogether unworthy (as I thought) the peru∣sal of the more candid and intelligent, which might most conveniently appear somewhere inserted in the handling of such an Argument, I was inclined to make use of the Opportunity.
I own the most ordinary and common Rea∣sons of Dedications, viz. to testifie the real and inward Honour and Respect I have for the many excellent Qualities of your Ho∣nours,
 to express my Acknowledgment par∣ticularly to your Lordship and noble Ancestors in my own and others Names, and to perform some small service to you in the Subject treat∣ed of.
I am not unsensible that such a thredbare Argument (hardly any one thing having had more Authors) in such a plain if not some∣times an offensive Dress as a great part of it appears in, without the advantage of any Ornament, may seem somewhat an unsutable Present to your Honours. But as there are many things in it (as I think) not observed, and many not in such manner delivered by others: so I know too that your Honours are not to learn from me that generally the most familiar and well known matters are truly of the greatest and most constant use, and to pre∣fer plain and important Truths before that which is only fine and new. Besides that so great Goodness as yours will not forget to ex∣cuse me, by considering that the Persons among whom I am now placed make it my most pro∣per Employment to explain and teach the most ordinary but useful Dutys of Religion; Some∣times
 at least in the most plain and simple manner I can: and then so little prudence as my own serves to tell me that the place it self may put me in mind of acknowledging in some mean way rather than none at all (my little leisure and my very broken Health not per∣mitting me to do better at this time or perhaps hereafter) the great Bounty of your Lord∣ship's illustrious Predecessors to the Church and University, to Religion and Learning (without doubt the two best things in the World) who were pleased to bestow the Pa∣tronage of this Rectory and three other of plentiful Revenue upon the happy place of my many years thoughts. Your Lordships most advantageous Temper, great Capacity and happy Education under so virtuous and learn∣ed a Parent seem not to permit any departure from the same generous Inclinations. May others imitate them, especially in this prophane and foolish Generation, in which true and useful Knowledge, Virtue, though wise and manly, Piety though generous and excellent are attempted to be trampled upon by ignorant and conceited Drollery, and not only an unchri∣stian
 but an unmanly Debauchery; which no∣thing so much supports as the Dulness and Confidence of the Brutes that practise it.
These either, they know not how to sepa∣rate Superstition (an ignorant Fear and Zeal) from Religion, and to secure themselves from the one without throwing away the other: or they gladly take Occasion through the se∣cret perswasion of their foolish and hurt∣ful Lusts from the former to do the latter. They must needs put away the Wheat with the Chaff, not only an ignorant and base fear but also the most reasonable free and inge∣nuous Reverence, Honour, Love and Obe∣dience to their Maker, the most amiable and satisfying Object the Soul of Man can be∣hold and embrace; without whom we can ne∣ver be what we should or would be; whom if we possess not by Contemplation, Love and Likeness to, we are either so little minded as never to enquire for, or so unhappy as in vain to endeavour after our most compleat Perfe∣ction and Felicity.
As for some small Service which I propo∣sed to my self of performing to your Ho∣nours,
 I hope it was not without some reason. Some of the Contents of the ensuing Treatise may not be altogether uncapable of it; and I have not had the Honour and Happiness of Converse with any Persons of your Qua∣lity, Age and Sex who are more able to judge of what is true and profitable, or better dispo∣sed to make use of it. Those who know your Honours will easily make the personal appli∣cation. And yet (Madam) I humbly beg your Leave to be but in one word so just as to let others know as well as my self that your natu∣ral Parts, your acquired Learning, your dis∣creet Piety and Virtue, your obliging Good∣ness are such as moreover render you the just Aemulation and Pattern of all of your Sex and honourable Condition and me in particular (as I also am your Lordship's)
