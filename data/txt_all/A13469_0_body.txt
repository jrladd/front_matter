His vndoubted Royalties being vnited vnder one and the same his most glorious Crowne, the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland;
Gods Immediate Vice-Gerent; Supreame head of all Persons, and Defender of the true, ancient Christian Faith, in these his Empires and Dominions.
MOst Mighty Monarch of this mourning Land,
Vpon the Knees of my submissiue minde:
I begge Acceptance at your Royall hand,
That my Lamenting Muse may fauour finde.

My Gracious Master was so good, so kinde,
So iust, so much-beloued neare and farre:
Which generally did Loue, and Duty binde
From all, and from me in particular.
But as your Maiesty vndoubted are
The Heyre vnto his Vertues and his Crowne:
I pray, that whether HEAVEN send Peace or War
You likewise may inherit his Renowne.
And as Death strucke his Earthly Glory downe,
Left you in Maiestie, and mourning Chiefe:
Yet through the World apparently 'tis knowne
Your Sorrow is an vniuersall Griefe.
Let this recomfort then your Princely heart,
That in this Duty, all men beares a part.
