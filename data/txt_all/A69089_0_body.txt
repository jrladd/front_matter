For as you haue bene most earnest to haue in vvriting this doctrine: so I doubt not, but you vvill be most diligent in the practise thereof: for vvhich cause I commit it into your hands, to vse to Gods glorie, the profit of his children, & to your ovvne comfort. Grace, peace, and loue vvith faith, from God the Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ be vvith you novve and euer. Amen.
