Gracious Prin∣cesse:
WHen I read how the Gods soo∣ner accep∣ted of a Handfull of Franken-sence offered by pure Devotion, then whole Hecatombes of Ara∣bian Spices in Ostenta∣tion: I am incouraged, having duely conside∣red
Your unlimited Goodnesse, to present this my Mite unto your Grace, and your Honourable Sister, For as you are Twinnes in Virtues, so I have joy∣ned You in my Devoti∣ons: Where first, I most humbly crave of You to passe a favourable Censure of my procee∣dings, it beeing, I know not usuall for a Woman to doe such things: Yet ELIHA sayth, There is a Spirit in Man, and the inspiration of the Almightie giveth them
Vnderstanding. And it is sayd againe: Out of the mouthes of Babes and Sucklings, thou shalt per∣fect Praise. I am assu∣red, I shall meet with mocking Ishmaels, that will carpe at Goodnesse; wherefore, I runne to Your selves for refuge; humbly craving to bee assisted by your Graci∣ousnesse, which will ap∣peare as the Splendant Sunne to disperse those Mists. I have chosen a subiect not altogether Pleasing; but my ayme
is, that it may prove Profitable, having ob∣served in this short course of my Pilgri∣mage, how apt Man is, not to thinke of his Mortalitie, which stealeth upon him as a Thiefe in the night: Ex∣perience teacheth mee, that there is no Acti∣on wisely undertaken, whereof the End is not fore-casted, in the first place, howsoever it bee last put in execution; I have ever accompted Ingratitude, to be like
a Beast, who having re∣ceived benefites, thinkes not of any acknowledge∣ments. Owing there∣fore, a due Debt of Thankefulnesse for Your unexpressable undeser∣ved Favours, and being no wayes able to cause the desires of my Heart to appeare worthy-your Acceptances, I have made choyse of this, as being perswaded thereto, by that truely Noble ver∣tuousnes which hath e∣vidently appeared in You, to the strengthe∣ning
of Goodnesse, that heere it may find admit∣tance, which otherwise might want Entertaine∣ment; and for that you have beene more then a Mother to mee. I ha∣ving onely from her re∣ceived life, but next under God from your Grace, & your honora∣ble Sister the being both of mee and mine. By which as there is none greater then your Selfe to whom in duty I am bound, so there is not any to whom I wish greater Prosperity both
for Temporall and Spiri∣tuall blessings, then to your Grace; beseech∣ing God to preserve you and your Honora∣ble Off-spring here up∣on Earth, with my no lesse vertuous Lady your Sister, to whom I am tyed by the same bonds of Thankfulnesse, that as God hath made your Renownes great up∣on earth, so I beseech him to adde to your Lives length of dayes, and after life, Eternall happinesse in the Hea∣vens,
whither CHRIST is gone to prepare a place for You. I al∣wayes remayning,
