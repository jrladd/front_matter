Excellent Lady,
I Present these Tapours to burne under the safe Protection of your ho∣norable
 Name: where, I pre∣sume, they stand secure from the Damps of Ignorance, and blasts of Censure: It is a small part of that abundant service, which my thankefull heart owes your incom∣parable Goodness. Be pleased to honour it with your noble Accep∣tance, which shall bee nothing but what your own esteem shall make it
Madam
