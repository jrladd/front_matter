MY LORD,
THE Motives which have in∣duc'd so great a stran∣ger as I am, to shroud under your Honours
Protection, this little Historical Novel, is that Zeal, which, from Heaven, animated your Breast, and push'd you forward, to be Exemplary in the earliest endea∣vours of uniting your own Person, and those worthy Pa∣triots, under your Lordships Conduct, to our late Generous Liberator's aid, our now most Gracious
Lord and King, in the Freeing of our Distressed Country from those many heavy Pressures un∣der which it had lain groaning so long, and which invited that Personal Valour, with which you so bravely Oppos'd the Multitude, which only could resist, (though not without the forfeiture of their Lives,) your no less
Just than Generous Designs. I have en∣tertain'd some hopes, My Lord, that you would be pleas'd to look with a favour∣able Aspect, on a Piece borrowed from a Design much like that, which stirred up your Honour to lay all at stake, when the True Religion, and the Proper Liberty of the Subject, call'd out so loud on all true
English Mens Assist∣ance. I am very sen∣sible, My Lord, of the fair opportunity I have at present, to enumerate, in a large Catalogue, your Ho∣nours Noble Quali∣ties and Virtues, ac∣cording to our Mo∣dern way of Dedi∣cations; and cer∣tainly, My Lord, I could not let pass so fit an Occasion, of following the Mode,
but that I had been perfectly inform'd, how much your Ho∣nour abhors such Gross Flattery, which has rais'd in me a fear of offending your Lordships Generous Temper, and made me rest contented, with the Relation of those few, but true Passa∣ges, cull'd from a prodigious Heap, which, besides the business I had in
hand, Justice it self required from me, at the beginning of this Epistle. May your Lordship long live on Earth, to en∣joy the Fruits of those Noble En∣deavours and At∣chievements, and re∣ceive hereafter in Heaven, those Re∣wards laid up for such, as like your Lordship, preferr'd the safety of their
Religion and Coun∣try, before their own Lives, and all other Worldly Interests; So most heartily Prays,
My Lord,
