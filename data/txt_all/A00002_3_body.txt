NOt Nature, Order, or Affinity
Can Friendships sacred knot so surely tye
As choice: For euer there we find the ground
Of Loue and Friendship most entirely sound;
As their Desires are like, so one there end,
Which is to be, and haue a faithfull friend.


I, that vnto mine owne defects am conscious,
Of such an honour durst not be ambitious,
Tell thou wert pleas'd to call mee Friend and Brother,
(I know not that thou deign'st it any other)
Wherefore whil'st Time Life to my Lines shall giue,
Our Friendships memory in them shall liue,
Who of true Friendship know no other end,
Than here to haue and bee

A faithfull Friend.
ROBERT AYLET.
