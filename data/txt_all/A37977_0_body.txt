MY LORD,
I Dedicate This to your
Lordship, and if any
shall ask the Reason, I know

no other than what all Eng∣land
knows as well as I, and
that is the place you hold
in the Church, and in the
Esteem of the Learned
World, your great and ad∣mired
Worth, your Skill
in the profoundest Sciences,
of which your Excellent
Works of Astronomy, and
particularly your Praelecti∣ons
of Comets are an unde∣niable
demonstration. Those
that know either your Lord∣ship
or me, will not say I
flatter you; for your vast
Merits command all that
can be said, and for my part
I am not inclined to fawn
upon any Person.

I cannot expect, my Lord,
you should approve of this
inconsiderable Present, yet
I persuade my self your
Lordship will not be displea∣sed
at the good meaning of
the Offerer. I need not ac∣quaint
your Lordship that it
is part of one of the Canons
of our Church, That Poor
Beneficed Men may go in short
Gowns.Can. 74. We mean Folks,
my Lord, must doe as well
as we can. I submit the
whole to your Lordship's
Censure, and hope you will
not lay open those Faults
which, it may be, none but
your self can see. But I

will usurp no farther on
your Lordship's Patience,
than onely by begging your
Pardon that I have done it
so far already.
I am,
My Lord,
