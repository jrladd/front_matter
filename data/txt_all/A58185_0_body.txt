MADAM,
TWO or three Reasons induce me to present this Discourse to your Ladyship, and to make choice of you for its Patroness: First, because I owe it to the Libera∣lity of your Honoured Brother, that I have this leisure to write any Thing. Secondly, Because also your many and signal Favors, seeing I am not in a Capacity to requite them, seem to ex∣act from me at least a publick Ac∣knowledgment,

which such a Dedica∣tion gives me an Opportunity to make. Thirdly, Because of such kind of Writings I know not where to chuse a more able Judge, or more candid Reader. I am sensible that you do so much abhor any thing that looks like Flattery, that out of an excess of Modesty you cannot patiently bear the hearing of your own just Com∣mendations, and therefore should I en∣large upon that Subject, I know I should have but little Thanks for my Pains.
Indeed you have much better Mo∣tives to do well, than the Praise of Men, the Favor of God, Peace of Con∣science, the Hope and Expectation of a future Reward of Eternal Happiness; and therefore I had rather write of you to others, to provoke them to imitate so excellent an Example, than to your Self, to encourage you in your Chri∣stian Course, and to fortifie you

in your Athletick Conflicts with the greatest of Temporal Evils, bodily Pain and Anguish; though I do not know why you should reject any con∣sideration that may conduce to support you under so heavy Pressures, and of so long continuance; of which to in∣genuous Natures true Honor, that is the concurrent Testimony and Appro∣bation of good Men, is not the mean∣est. No less Man than S. Augustine was doubtful whether the extremity of bodily Pain, were not the greatest Evil that Humane Nature was capa∣ble of suffering: Nay (saith he) I was sometimes compelled to consent to Cor∣nelius Celsus, that it was so, neither did his Reason seem to me absurd; we be∣ing compounded of two Parts, Soul and Body, of which the first is the better, the latter the worser, the greatest Good must be the best thing belonging to the better Part, that is Wisdom, and the greatest Evil the worst thing incident to the wor∣ser

Part (the Body) that is Pain. Now though I know not whether this Rea∣son be firm and conclusive, yet I am of accord with him, that of all the Evils we are sensible of in this World it is the Sorest; the most resolute Pa∣tience being baffled and prostrated by a fierce and lasting Paroxysm of the Gout or Stone, or Colick, and com∣pelled to yield to its furious Insults, and confess itself vanquished, the Soul be∣ing unable to divert, or to do any thing else but pore upon the Pain. And therefore those Stoical vaunts of their Wise Mans being happy in Perillus his Bull, I utterly reject and explode, as vain Rhodomontades and Chimerical Fig∣ments, for that there never was such a wise Man among them, nor indeed could be; Yet do I not say, that the Patience of a good Man can be so far conquered by the sharpest and severest Torments as to be compelled to deny or blaspheme God or his Religion, yea

or so much as to complain of his Inju∣stice, though perchance he may be brought with Job to curse his Day, yet not to curse his God, as his Wife tempt∣ed him to do.
Now that the great  and , the most just Judg and Re∣warder would be pleas'd so to qualifie and mitigate your Sufferings as not to exceed the measure of your Strength and Patience, or else arm you with such an high Degree of Christian Fortitude, as to be able to grapple with the most ex∣treme, and when you have finished your Course in this World, grant you a placid and easie Passage out of it, and dignifie you as one of his Victors, with a Crown of Eternal Glory and Felicity, is the Prayer of,
Madam,
