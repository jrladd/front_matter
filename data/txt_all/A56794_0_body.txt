Most Gracious Sovereign,
VAlens the Emperor having incautelously enter∣tain'd the pernicious Errors of Arius, in a short time great part of Christendom became infected with the same Principles: In those Days Aphrates the Monk, leaving his Cell, appeared in Publick, striving by his Art and Wit to oppose that ra∣ging Torrent; and to such as thought him too forward, he offered no other Apology, than that the Necessity of the Times forced him from his Retirement. Our im∣placable Enemies of Rome, who have for many Years laboured the Destruction of our Church and Nation, find∣ing their own Hands too feeble to effect their Enter∣prize, have at last by a subtle Stratagem brought over too many of Ours to their Assistance; for having cun∣ningly inveigled with some to press the Doctrine of Pas∣sive Obedience, in a time unseasonable, and in a Cause
not requiring, Men's Affections became much alienate from the Truth they fear'd would expose 'em; and ha∣ving prevailed on others to invalidate your Majesty's Just and Legal Title to the Crown, by introducing an uncouth Notion of a King de Facto, by which Doctrine they have brought some to believe, that Rebellion against a Prince no better qualified, was necessary, just, and ac∣ceptable as well to God as Man; in which Opinion some have already persisted unto Death. At such a time to be silent, is to be insensible; not to reprove, is to encourage; and not to oppose such irreligious Principles and Practises, is to want not only Loyalty but Religion. The chief Designs of this Discourse, now humbly laid at your Majesty's Feet, are to confirm such, as have hitherto kept themselves uncorrupted, in Loyalty and Obedience to your Majesty, to reclaim if possible some of the fallen; as for the more froward and obstinate, they must be left to your Majesty's Justice; which I hope that God, who hath so miraculously preserved and defended you, will direct and enable you so to execute, that it may be seen to the Comfort of the Loyal and the Terror of the Re∣bellious, that your Majesty bears not the Sword in vain.
The Lord grant your Majesty a long Life, that you may at last behold and rejoice in the Travel of your Soul, the Preservation, Reformation, and Prosperity of your Kingdoms: And let all the People say, Amen.
