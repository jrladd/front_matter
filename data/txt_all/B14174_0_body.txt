RIGHT HONOVRABLE, Though few others would, I trust Your Lordship will vouchsafe counte∣nance to these Cōmentaries, rude and imperfect I must confesse, but whose vntimely or too hastie birth (if so it proue, and mu ee¦red) hath not beene caused by any inordinate appetite, but only from a longing desire of testifying that loue and dutie which I owe vnto your Honourable Familie and Person, as in many other respects, so chiefly in this: That being ingaged vnto a more gainefull, but not so good a course of life, and welnigh rooted in another soile; I was by your Lordships fauourable aduise and countenance transplan∣ted to this famous Nurserie of good learning. Wherein (by his blessing who onely giues increase to what his seruants plant or water) I haue growne to such a degree of maturitie, as these raw meditations argue, or so wilde a graffe was capable of. Course and vnpleasant my fruit may prone: but, whiles it shall please the Lord to continue his wonted blessings of health and other op∣portunities,
 altogether vnfruitfull (by his assistance) I will not, altogether idle I cannot, be. Such as these first fruits are (much better I dare not promise,) the whole after-crop (I trust) shall be: both, for the sinceritie of my intention, acceptable (I doubt not) to my God; the later, I hope, more ripe in the iudgment of men, then can in reason bee expected the first fruites of the same mans labours should be. Thus humbly beseeching your Honour to accept these as they are, and to esteeme of them (howsoeuer otherwise) as an vndoubted pledge of a minde indeuouring to shew it selfe thankful for benefits alreadie receiued; and much desiring the continuance of your honourable fauours: I continue my prayers vnto the Almightie that he would multiply his best fauours and bles∣sings vpon you.
