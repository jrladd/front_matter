WHat others have
done by the
Law of your au∣thority,
Present∣ed
before yee
their advise in matters of Re∣ligion;
I shall, from the law
of love to your Iust authority,
present ye, not my advise (the
Lord himself advise and
counsell ye) but some things
which concern the Lord Ie∣sus
Christ, and the peace and
prosperity of your Kingdome;

and that I may not be dis∣obedient
to the heavenly visi∣on,
. Act. 26. 19  or light of God revealed
in me.
There are two Principles
in the world which have
these sad, and dark conclu∣sions
attending them, the
two Principles are these:
1. That such as conforme
not to the Doctrine, and dis∣cipline
established; and yet as
to the State are good Subjects,
and peaceably affected, shall
be proceeded against by fines,
imprisonment, &c.
2. That such as shall
speak upon the Scriptures, or
open them, Publikely, or in
Private, and are not ordain∣ed
by the laying on of the
hands of that present esta∣blished
ministery of a king∣dome,
shall be proceeded a∣gainst

by fines, imprison∣ments,
&c.
The sad and dark conclusi∣ons
which follow, are these:
1. All the glorious disco∣veries
of God, above, or be∣yond
that Systeme, or form of
Doctrine &c. shall be judged,
and sentenced, as Heresie and
Schisme; and so God himself
shall be judged by man,
which must needs be a sin,
bringing much desolation;
unless they that enact such
Laws, were that very infal∣lible
Apostleship for Interpre∣tation
of all Scriptures; as the
first Apostleship was for wri∣ting
all Scriptures. And is
God, a God of the Iewes only,
is he not a God of the Gen∣tiles
also?Rom. 3. 29. ? Psal. 51.  that is, is God li∣mited
to one sort of men?
Thou thoughtest (saith God)

that I was altogether,Psal. 51.  such a
one as thy self; that is, a God
meerly of one Image or fi∣gure:
behold, the Heaven of
Heavens cannot contain him,Psal. 
he dwelleth not in Temples
made with hands, and where
is his habitation, and who
hath known the place of his
rest? That is, what is man
that he should conceive that
God is only in a place, or Tem∣ple,
or form of Worship, or
Systeme of Doctrine of his
forme or making, since the
time is come, that we do no
longer worship in this Temple,Joh. 4. 
nor at Ierusalem; but they
that worship, must worship in
spirit and truth;Joh. 14.  which truth,
is he only who is the truth.
2. Many thousands of
pretious Christians shall be
under Delinquency, as to fines,

imprisonment, &c. and under
the scandall of Hereticks and
Schismaticks; because not
seeing by that one light, nor
believing in that one Pro∣portion
of faith, nor recei∣ving
such interpretations and
Consequences of Scriptures, for
the very Scriptures them∣selves;
and by such persecu∣tion,
the civill power which
is received from God, shall
be turned against God, or a∣gainst
the more spirituall ad∣ministration
of God; and so
Gods Administrations dash∣ed
one against another.
Act. 9. Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? touch not Psal. mine a∣nointed,
 and do my Prophets
no harm: not as having do∣minion
over the heritage, orLordship over faith.
3. That were to set up

the Church Politie of the Iews
amongst Christians; and not
according to Gods divine a∣pointment,
but mans; for God
in that first Politie of the
Iews Church under the Old-Testament,
joyned to the
Kings and Magistracy then,
a Priesthood with Vrim and
Thummim; and Prophets a∣nointed
of God as a certain,
true, infallible, directive pow∣er
for ordering that way of
administration; but this way
of Christians now, without
any such warrant, or appoint∣ment
of God brings back a∣gain
the same Church Poli∣tie,
under the New-Testa∣ment,
which was typicall
as to Christ the King, and
Priest, and Prophet, and joyns
to Kings & Magistracy now,
a ministery less of God, less

certain, less true, not infalli∣ble;
so as all texts, instan∣ces,
and examples brought
from the Old-Testament of
the Kings, Princes, and Ma∣gistrates
of Israel, compelling
to the worship of God, with∣out
proving the continu∣ance
of the same Church Poli∣tie
under the New-Testament;
and the like Priesthood, and
Prophets accordingly sent of
God to direct them, is all in∣valid,
and of no effect as to
such proceedings.
4. The infinitely abound∣ing
spirit of God, which
blows when and where it list∣eth,
and ministers in Christi∣ans
according to the gift, and
prophesies according to the
will of the Almighty God;
pouring its self out upon all
flesh, giving out the word and

making the company great,Joh. 3. 8. Rom. 12. 6. Act. 2. 18. Psal. 68. 11. . 
who publish it, even this Al∣mighty,
 all glorious, infinitely
abounding, dispensing, and re∣vealing
Spirit, is made sub∣ject
to the Laws & Ordinances
of men, to the pleasures and
wills, to the measures and
forms of men, to outward ce∣remonies,
as Ordination, &c.
God must not speak till man
give him leave; not teach, nor
Preach, but whom man al∣lows,
and approves, & ordains.
5. This making laws for
punishing all that conforme
not to the doctrine and disci∣pline
established, destroyes
the true interests of all states
and kingdomes, excluding all
societies of men, but of one
sort and forme, though ne∣ver
so peaceably affected, or
obedient as men and Subjects,

respectively to the State, and
civill government thereof,
and was never found in any
State, or Church Politie by
divine appointment, but in
that one nation of the Iews,
whose Politie, as to such a
form, God himself peculi∣arly
made, owned and pre∣served,
and the Lord Iesus
himself fulfilled and dissol∣ved.
For Heresie and Schisme, I
know ye ought not to tole∣rate
any, but to let them
bear their own judgement,
which is spirituall admoniti∣on,
Church-censure, rejection,
excommunication; which if
effectuall, as all true, right,
spirituall censures have been
and are, is that just proporti∣onable
judgment for such
Gospel-sins, if not effectuall;

then the insuffiency,Tit. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2 Thes. 3. 15. .  weakness,
unprofitableness of such as as∣sume
such Church-power, and
censures, will appear before
ye.
And as to that point of the
present Ordination, which
some have so pressed upon ye,
distinguishing to ye, that
their Ordination was from
the Bishops, as Ministers, not
as Bishops. Right Honourable,
consider, that distinction
cannot be, for there was no
such thing as Ministers in
the Church of Rome, or of
England as to this successive∣ly
pretended Ordination; but
Priests, and Bishops, or Epis∣copacy,
and Priesthood: and
surely if Episcopacy doth not,See Mason. Fox booke of Martyrs. Beda. 
yet Priesthood doth altoge∣ther
evacuate the essence of
Ministery now under the

New-Testament as by such
Ordination: and how much
more rationall are their Ar∣guments,
who hold their
Ministry lawfull, from the
lawfulness of Episcopacy;
then those, who deny Epis∣copacy,
&c. and yet have no
Ordination but from them.
For this Christian-liberty, it
is such as preserves not only
the outward peace of Christi∣ans
who enjoy it, but the
peace and prosperity of King∣domes,
and Magistrates, who
establish it; and the life, glo∣ry,
and happiness, destruction,
and death of Kingdomes is
wrapped in the Christians
life or death:Ephes. 5. 30. Act. 9. 4. Mal. 3. Psal. 105. 15.  they are the
parts and Members of Christ,
the apple of his eye, his Jew∣els,
 his anointed, his Prophets,
his Children.

As therefore ye look to be
prospered by this Spirit of
God; as ye look for wisdom
from this Spirit of God to
govern this State; as ye look
for comfort from this Spirit
of God in all your distresses;
as ye look for gifts from
this Spirit of God in all the
administrations; as ye look
for the sweet spirituall breath∣ings
and refreshment from
this Spirit of God in all the
severall changes of this crea∣tion:
love, preserve, Indulge
this Spirit; quench not, oppose
not, oppress not this Spirit:
confine it not to one out∣ward
form or fellowship of
men, which are not that
Catholick Church,Thse 1. 5 19. Act. 7. 51. Ephes. 4. 30.  that A∣postleship
of infallibility; and
they that are spirituall, live
in that spirit & truth, which

makes them free indeed,Joh. 8. 32, 36. .  and
it is below that Spirit of
God, to Petition liberty of
conscience in spirituals, from
any men or Magistrates in
the World; because God
will make Ierusalem a cup of
trembling to all Nations, and
a stone of astonishment; and
the spirituall Christians will
rather hold forth such
things, to bear witness to
the truth, and to desire all
to forbear persecution, as
much for their own sakes
who persecute, as for theirs
who are persecuted.
And for that just power of
Magistracy, I acknowledge
it a Power Ordained of God,. Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3. 
for administration of Iustice
and righteousness in the socie∣ties
of men, and nations; a
Minister of God for good, a

terrour to evill works; and
that we are to be subjest to
every Ordinance of man, for
the Lords sake; and for this
cause we pay tribute to whom
tribute; honour to whom honour:
and all societies of Christians
by no pretence of religion, or
liberty for the worship of
God,Rom. 13. 4, 5. .  are to resist or disturb
the civill administration of
this power: but as to that
consideration; all Christians
are to suffer according to the
will of God, (all lawfull ways
for preservation of States and
Kingdomes still excepted)
and all such Magistracy are
to preserve their respective
States, by all wholesome, law∣full,
cautionary Lawes and
Ordinances in Peace; so as
while liberty or indulgency,
as to the tender consciences in

Religion is spoken on, yet no
less security of the State, no
diminution to the just power
of Magistracy; no less pre∣servation
of the Peace of the
Kingdom is desired by those
that are truly spirituall. And
though many suffer under
the name of Hereticks and
Schismaticks before ye, for
not conforming to the pre∣sent
doctrine and discipline
established; Right Honourable,
consider, whether this doth
not call in question all the
very present doctrine and
discipline so established; for
by this very thing of judg∣ing
all Inconformity to the
present worship and form of
things to be Heresie; by the
same, all this present form of
worship and confession of faith
is judged Heresie and Schism,

to the late former govern∣ment,
and doctrine establish∣ed
in the Church of Eng∣land:
this present Synod of
men being no more that visi∣ble
Catholike Church, and in∣fallible
Apostleship, then the
former were, so as the
changing the former Articles
of the Church of England in∣to
a new confession of faith,
the Episcopacy into Presbyte∣ry;
and so altering both
the fundamentals in religi∣on
and the discipline, is e∣qually
new light and Heresie,
As to the former doctrine
and discipline: (and if it be
objected) but this present
Synod, are men of more light
and Piety then the former,
and so they establish more
truth, and bring in more Re∣formation;
if so, why is there

not more love, more peace∣ableness,
more self-deniall,
more power of godliness, then
there was in the suffering
Bishops, and the Preaching
Lay-Martyrs then; who
loved Christ in himself, and
in one another.
And now (Noble Sena∣tors)
since very worthy things
have been formerly done by ye
unto this Nation; let not your
Sun set in a cloud, nor your
light shine upon those that
have loved you as the Moon
once upon the Water, ma∣king
it of the colour of Blood▪
are ye not come to the King∣dome
in Peace? Are not the
gleanings of Ephraim in the
Vintage? Did not David
say,2 Sam. 19. 22.  shall any man be put
to death this day in Israel?
The Lord enlighten ye (if

it be his will) more and
more, in the knowledge of
Iesus Christ, and of the love
of God, and of all who have
any thing of God in them,
and let you see those things
which concerne your peace in
this your day.
