GENTLEMEN,
THere are none so capable to judge of the truth of this Napolitan Story as your selves, who have so frequent Intelligence from that Countrey where it was acted; Therefore, I presume, no man will question my judgment for making this Dedi∣cation.
Moreover, I had some particular engage∣ments that induc'd me thereunto, in regard of those helps which I received from some Wor∣thy Members of that Society, who favour'd me with the sight of divers of their Letters from time to time, and furnish'd me with

other advantages towards the compiling of this Piece.
The Part you formerly had attended the Fisherman to his Greatness, and this accom∣panies him to his Grave. That blind instable Thing which we call Fortune never shew'd Her self more like Her self then She did in the handling of this man, whom in a very few days She rais'd to such a prodigious alti∣tude that the Great Turk was not more terri∣ble in Constantinople, then he was in Naples. But afterwards, like a Statue of some course Stone, set up upon a high Marble pedestal or frame, she suffered him to fall down and dash himself to pieces.
This second Part is nothing inferiour to the first in strangeness; and he who with a seri∣ous well-weigh'd judgment will meditate on the passages thereof, will confess that Reali∣ties never appeared more like Romances then in this Story: For it will tell you of above a hundred several Fights and Skirmishes that happen'd in Naples within the compass of about two Months time; how every Street was made Frontier one to another, and dispu∣ted by inches; how above fourscore thou∣sand Cannon-bullets were shot from the three Castles, and twenty thousand from the

Town; A great number of stately Palaces, with invaluable rich Furniture, all turn'd to ashes by the fury of the Fire, and of the Peo∣ple, who may be said to be the more furious of the two. And indeed it cannot be denied but the people had some reason to be incens'd, in regard of those multitude of Gabels that were impos'd upon every thing; which Gabels had flown so high, that they had got up to the tops of the very Trees, among all sorts of Fruit; Insomuch that one may well say, the Napolitan Coursier was almost rid quite off of his legs, and his back so gall'd that upon the least rubbing he could not choose but winch, kick and flounce, which he did to some pur∣pose, so that he had almost quite orethrown his Rider. Now, if the Spaniard had lost Na∣ples, you know better then I, what an infinite detriment it had been unto him, it being one of the fairest Flowers in his Garden, one of the best patches upon his Pilgrims coat, as the Frenchman compares the squandred Domini∣ons of Spain. For it is to be seen upon good account, how that this King and his Father have had above a hundred millions of crowns in meer Donatives from that Kingdom, be∣sides the stable Rents and Perquisites of the Crown, which comes to near upon three mil∣lions

per annum. Insomuch that it had been more advantagious for Spain that Massaniello had not been kill'd so soon; for had he lived a few days longer he had taken a course to raise five millions for the King in compensati∣on of the Gabels.
So, desiring again your gentle acceptance of this now-compleated Story, as a further evi∣dence of my respects unto you, I rest,
Sirs,
