GOod Bookes, Good Minds best please, where bad Mindes be,
Desert shall still be raild at, Vice passe free,
Enuie, Debate, Pride, Flatterie, and a whore;
The Vicious minded Foole, mindes nothing more.
Harlots, for hot sinne-offerings shall finde
Fauour, and Friends, to them the World is kinde,
But when the wealth of Soules, in Vertues Line
Leuells Man's crooked Thoughts, to thoughts Diuine.
'Tis sleighted then; Most Worldlings, like false Friend,
Loue not for Vertue, but their owne base Ends.
Times Lordly Churle, deepe read, in Errors Schoole,
Esteemes Plaine-Dealing, but a Vertuous Foole:
Therefore to thee, whose Sacred Soule desires
Celestiall Solace, Heauenly Holy fires.
To thy Religious thoughts, apt to preuent,
And fly from Sinne; to thee I this present.
