Right Honorable,
A Debtor I acknow∣ledge my selfe un∣to the Church of God by calling, & a speci∣all

ingagement lieth upon me, both of trust and pro∣mise to serve the Church in this way, in bringing towards the furtherance of the building of it, that which hath beene squared and framed to my hand by a wise Master builder, who hath showed him∣selfe approved unto God, a workeman that nee∣deth not to be ashamed. This I doe here humbly present unto your Ho∣nours protection; I may perhaps from some, in∣curre the censure of too much boldnesse in using

your Honours name, but your courtesie and sweet affabilitie springing from your native gentelnesse of disposition doth secure me: and the rather since I present this unto your Honour, not in my owne name, but in the name and behalfe of the Wid∣dow, who though she may claime the priviledge of her Sex from appearing in Print herselfe, yet shee is desirous that the li∣ving and lasting Monu∣ments of her deare hus∣band should be brought

forth for the good of Gods Church, under the patronage and protection of your Honour, to whom the Author was every way so much oblieged; now I have no reason to doubt but that as your Honour was pleased to take the Reverend and learned Author into the protection of your noble family, for you will bee pleased to countenance these his owne legitimate children, which are now sent abroad as Orphans deprived of their father.

Their owne worth can∣not but gaine them e∣steeme, but I know your Honour will prize them the more for their fathers sake: who whilest hee was alive did secure your Honour by his Prayers which he did daily offer up to God, not pro for∣ma as a legall and dead ceremony, but pro Ani∣ma, as a spirituall and lively sacrifice, in the be∣halfe of your honour and happinesse, and now that he is dead yet speaketh in these and those other

Sermons of his which beare your honours name. If you be pleased to pa∣tronize, countenance and peruse them, they will reflect much brightnesse upon your noblenesse, as they receive splendour from it. Thus under your Honours protection I doe present them unto the world, humbly cra∣ving the priviledge of your pardon for my bold∣nesse, and heartily be∣seeching the Lord to mak you still and still to doe worthily in Israel and

to inrich your Honour more and more with grace here and glory hereafter.
