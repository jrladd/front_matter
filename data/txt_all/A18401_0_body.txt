AS nothing vnder heauen is more remou'd
From Truth & virtue, then Opinions prou'
By vulgar Voices: So is nought more true
Nor soundly virtuous then things held by few:
Whom Knowledge (entred by the sacred line,
And gouernd euermore by grace diuine,)
Keepes in the narrow path to spacious heauen,
And therfore, should no knowing spirit be driue
From fact, nor purpose; for the spleens prophan
Of humours errant, and Plebeian;
But, Famelike, gather force as he goes forth,
The Crowne of all Acts ends in onely worth.
Nor will I feare to postrate this poore Rage
Of forespoke Poesie, to your patronage,
(Thrice worthy Earle), & your vnequald grace
(Most Noble Countesse) for the one-ear'd Race
Of set-eyd vulgars, that will no waie see
But that their stiffe necks driue them headlongy,
Stung with the Gadflie of misgouernd zeale:
Nor heare but one tale and that euer ill.
These I contemne, as no Rubs fit for me
To checke at, in my way t' Integritie.
Nor will ye be incenst that such a Toie
Should put on the presumption to enioie
Your grauer eare, my Lord, and your faire eye
(Illustrous Ladie) since poore Poesie
Hath beene a Iewell in the richest eare
Of all the Nuptiall States, that euer were.
For as the Bodies pulse (in Phisique) is
A little thing; yet therein th' Arteries
Bewray their motion, and disclose, to Art
The strength, or weakenesse, of the vitall part;
Perpetually moouing, like a watch
Put in our Bodies: So this three mens catch,
This little Soules Pulse, Poesie, panting still
Like to a dancing pease vpon a Quill,
Made with a childes breath; vp and downe to fly
(Is no more manly thought) And yet thereby
Euen in the corps of all the world we can
Discouer all the good and bad of man,
Anatomise his nakednesse, and be
To his chiefe Ornament, a Maiestie:
Erect him past his human Period
And heighten his transition into God.
Thus Sun-like, did the learnd and most diuine
Of all the golden world, make Poesie shine;
That now, but like aglow worm, gleams by night
Like Teachers, scarce foūd, by their proper light.
But this (my Lord) and all poore virtues else
Expos'd, ah las, like perdu Sentinels
o warne the world of what must needs be nie
or pride, and auarice, glas'd by Sanctitie,
Must be distinguisht, and decided by
Your cleere, ingenuous, and most quiet eye
Exempt from passionate, and duskie fumes,
That blinde our Reason: and in which consumes
The Soule, halfe choakt, with stomacke casting mists
red in the purest, turnd mere humorists.
And where with douelike sweet humility
They all things should authorise or deny,
The vulgar heate and pride of splene and blood
Blaze their opinions, which cannot be good.
For as the Bodies Shadow, neuer can
Shew the distinct, and expact Forme of man;
So nor the bodies passionate affects
Can euer teach well what the Soule respects.
For how can mortall things, immortall shew▪
Or that which false is, represent the trew▪
The peacefull mixture then that meetes in yow
(Most tēperat Earl) that nought to rule do thow:
In which, as in a thorough kindled Fire,
Light and Heat marrie Iudgement and Desire.
Reason is still in quiet, and extends
All things t' aduantage of your honored Ends,
May well authorise all your Acts of Note,
Since all Acts vicious, are of Passion got:
" Through dead Calms, of our Perturbations euer
" Truths Voice (to soules eares set) we heare or neuer
" The meerely animate Man, doth nothing see
" That tends to heauen: It must be onely He
" That is mere foule: Her separable powers
" The scepter giuing heere: That then discourse
" Of Motions that in sence doe neuer fall,
" Yet know them too, and can distinguish all
" With such a freedome, that our earthly parts
" Sincke all to earth: And then th'ingenuous arts
" Doe their true office, Then true Policie
" Windes like: a serpent, through all Empery.
" Her folds on both sides bounded, like a flood
" With high-shores listed, making great and good
 " Whom she instructeth, to which, you (my Lord)
May lay all claimes that Temper can afford;
Nought gathering ere t' is ripe: and so must taste
Kindely and sweetely, and the longer hast,
All fruits, in youth, ripe in you; and must so
Imply a facultie to euer growe.
And as the morning that is calme and gray,
Deckt all with curld clowds; that the Sunne doth lay
With varied coullours; All aloft exhall'd
As they t'adorn euen heauen it selfe were call'd,
And could not fall in slendrest deawes till Night,
But keepe daies Beauty: firme and exquisite;
More for delight fit, and doth more adorne
Euē th'Euē with Graces, then the youthful morn:
So you (sweete Earle) stay youth in aged bounds
Euen absolute now, in all lifes grauest grounds,
Like Aire, fill euery corner of your place,
Your grace, your virtue heightning: virtue, grace
And keeping all clowds high, aire calme, & cleer
And in your selfe all that their height should rere
Your life and light will proue a still full Moone,
And all your night time nobler then your noone,
The Sunne is in his rising, height, and set
Still (in himselfe) alike, at all parts great,
His light, heat, greatnes, coullors that are showne
To vs; as his charge, meerely is our owne.
So let your charge, my Lord, in others be,
But in your selfe hold Sun-like constancie.
For as men skild in Natures study, say,
The world was not the world, nor did conuay
To coupling bodies Natures common forme,
But (all confus'd, like waues struck with a storme)
Some small were, and (in no set being, staid)
All comprehension, and connexion fled;
The greater, and the more compact disturb'd
With ceaseles warre, and by no order curb'd,
Till earth receiuing her set magnitude
Was fixt her selfe, and all her Birth indu'd
With staie and law, so this small world of ours:
Is but a Chaos of corporeall powers:
Nor yeelds his mixt parts, forms that may becom
A human Nature; But at randome rome
Past brutish fashions, and so neuer can
Be cald the ciuill bodie of a man;
But in it, and against it selfe still fights,
In competence of Cares, loyes, Appetites:
The more great in command, made seruile more,
Glutted, not satisfied: in plenty, poore:
Till vp the Soule mounts, and the Scepter swaies
Th'admired Fabricke of her world suruaies,
And as it hath a magnitude confinde,
o all the powers therein, she sees combinde
n fit Acts for one end, which is t'obay
Reason, her Regent; Nature giuing way:
Peace, Concord, Order, Stay proclaim'd, and Law,
And none commanding, if not all in Awe,
Passion, and Anger, made to vnderlie,
And heere concludes, mans morall Monarchie
n which, your Lordships milde Soule sits so hie
Yet cares so little to be seene, or heard,
That in the good thereof, her scope is Sphear'd.
The Theban Ruler, paralleling Right,
Who, thirst of glory, turnd to appetite
Of inward Goodnesse, was of speech so spare,
To heare, and learne, so couetous, and yare,
That (of his yeares) none, things so many knew:
Nor in his speeches, ventured on so few:
Forth then (my Lord) & these things euer thirst
Till Scandall pine, and Bane-fed enuie burst.
And you, (most noble) Lady as in blood
In minde be Noblest, make our factious brood
Whose forked tongs, wold fain your honor sting
Conuert their venomd points into their spring:
Whose owne harts guilty, of faults faind in yours
Wold fain be posting off: but, arme your powers
With such a seige of vertues, that no vice
Of all your Foes, Aduantage may entice
To sally forth, and charge you with offence,
But sterue within, for very conscience
Of that Integritie, they see exprest
In your cleere life: Of which, th'examples Rest,
May be so blamelesse; that all past must be
(Being Fount to th'other) most vndoubtedly
Confest vntouch't; and Curiositie
The beame picke rather from her own squint eie,
Then ramp stil at the motes shade, faind in yours,
Nought doth so shame this chimick serch of ours
As when we prie long for assur'd huge prise,
Our glasses broke, all vp in vapor flies.
And as, the Royall Beast, whose image you
Beare in your armes, and aires great Eagle too;
Sill as they goe, are said to keepe in close
Their seres, & Tallons, lest their points shold lose
Their vseful sharpnes, when they serue no vse:
So this our sharp-eyd search that we abuse
In others brests, we should keepe in, t'explore
Our owne fowle bosomes, and quit them before
VVe ransacke others: but (great Ladie) leaue
These Rules to them they touch; do you receaue
Those free ioies in your honour, and your Loue
That you can say are yours; and euer moue
VVhere your comand, as soon is seru'd as kown,
Ioyes plac't without you, neuer are your owne.
