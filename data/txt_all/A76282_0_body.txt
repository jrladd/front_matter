SIR,
I Here present you with a Discourse, which has no other pretence to your Patronage, but onely the good Intention wherewith it is offered: and (Sir) you may remember, that this hath sometimes made a cup of cold water a Pre∣sent to a mighty King, acceptable; and preferred the two Mites of the poor Widow, as an Offering more grateful than much larger Gifts.
Sir, the reason of this Address proceeds not from an Am∣bition of appearing in Print, for I have often declaimed a∣gainst the Scribbling of the Age; nor in satisfaction to the Im∣portunities of Friends, the usual pretence in the like cases; nor yet purely in gratitude to those many Favours you have obliged me withal, the Common-place and thred-bare Comple∣ment of Dedications: Sir, I look'd back, and lo the too visible Ruines of our late Contentions! I look'd forward, and saw the face of things tending much to the same way; I thought my self concern'd to move toward the prevention of the growing evil, as knowing that an ordinary Physician and mean Medi∣cine may overcome a Disease in its beginnings; which being become chronical and inveterate, will triumph over the most exquisite Preparations. So that the whole Plot drives at no∣thing but the advancement of Peace and Love among Neigh∣bours and Christians; and, Sir, when I resolved to adventure it abroad, to try mens eyes, and second thoughts as well as ears, I presently considered that Sphere wherein you stand, that com∣manding
Influence you have with us, and withal, your own example, the patern of those Vertues which you will find (though very imperfectly) described within. Whereupon I have presumed to prefix your Name to the Front, as the surest Ex∣pedient to make the Doctrine, at least in its first and more pri∣vate Design, successful.
Sir, I have no more to add, but this: May you be like your Father in every thing but shortness of days, is the devout prayer of,
