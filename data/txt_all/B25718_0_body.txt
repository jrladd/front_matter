I Have made bold to prefix Your NAME to The Hi∣story of the Famous Cardinal de RICHLIEƲ, and hope the Dignity of the Subject will, in some manner, atone for all the Failures of the Translation. That Eminent Person, whose Principal Actions it relates, was One of the most Able Ministers which this Part of the World has produc'd for many Ages; and to his extraordi∣nary Conduct France is indebted for the Formidable Grandeur it now enjoys; which all the United Forces of Europe, with so much Pains and Expence, endeavour to depress. He first put a stop to all
 Her intestine Broils, which made Her incapable of looking abroad, by cutting off all those Sources which used to feed the Rebellious Humours before: He first laid the Foundation of Her Greatness at Sea, revived the Discipline of Her Armies, and secured as well as en∣larged Her Frontiers on the Con∣tinent. And as for those Rival Nations about Her, which were in a Situation to dispute the Sove∣raignty with Her, or to disturb Her Repose, He either humbled them by Force of Arms, or by his industrious Emissaries so embarass'd their Affairs at home, that they were not in a Condition to annoy Her. 'Tis true indeed, the People were Gainers under his Ministry, what∣ever the Monarchy got by it, and that the Station he possess'd was not agreeable to one of the Ecclesiastick Character. It must likewise be ac∣knowledg'd, that he help'd to dissolve
 the ancient Constitution of his Country, in the room of which he introdued an Unlimited Power; that he ruin'd the Authority of the Nobless, by obliging them to a precarious Dependance upon the Crown, and that he too often sa∣crificed to his Ambition and Re∣venge. However, such was his happy Fate or his Dexterity, that he weather'd all the Storms that so often threatned him; and though he had a jealous Master to manage, whose dark and distrustful Temper gave him no small difficulty, yet he died in the greatest Reputation with him, that ever Subject did with his Prince. What particularly deserves to be remarked in him, is that amidst a thousand other Cares and Distractions, he found leisure to encourage Learning, and to culti∣vate the French Language and Elo∣quence, with so much success, as to render them in a manner as Univer∣sal
 as he projected their Monarchy.
As for this History, in part Tran∣slated by me, it comprehends the most remarkable Occurrences of Christendom, during the whole time of the Cardinal's sitting at the Helm; in all which he had a consi∣derable share; and as he was infinite∣ly superiour to his contemporary Ministers, always managed to his Master's Advantage.
I know 'tis a just Reflection up∣on most Translators, That they affect to be as partial to their Authors, as Lovers are to their Mistresses; that they not only be∣stow abundance of good Qualities upon them, which the rest of the World are not able to discover, and often over-value what is really com∣mendable in them, but either con∣ceal their Defects, or else labour to set them off for so many Beauties, with Strains of false Rhetorick. However, I think I may safely
 affirm, without the least preposses∣sion in favour of our Historian, That his Language is Easie and Unaffected; his Narration is no where clogged with impertinent Digressions; nor swell'd into a tiresom Prolixity with nauseous Re∣petitions; nor does it languish un∣der a tedious detail of idle Particu∣lars. His Reflections all along are Solid, Just, and Instructive, and show him to be a Man of Honour and Sincerity, one that was well acquainted with the World, and passionately concerned for the an∣cient Liberties and Wellfare of France. For which Reason we find him frequently reproaching the Car∣dinal, with ruining the Power of Parliaments; which in all our neigh∣bouring Kingdoms that were found∣ed by the Northern People upon the Ruines of the Roman Empire, had, according to the different Ge∣nius of the Climate, a greater or
 lesser Share in the publick Admi∣nistration; and yet, on the other Hand, he is not backward to ac∣knowledge his Services, when they apparently tended to the Interest of his Country. Except where he touches upon our English Affairs, and unjustly represents King Charles the First as inclin'd to Popery, he is Impartial in every thing he says: But we may easily forgive this single Slip in a Foreigner, who might be misled as to that Particular, by some late Memoirs of our own Writers, who have treated the Me∣mory of that unhappy Monarch with equal Insolence and Malice. He never expresses his Resentments at the expence of Truth; but as he de∣scribes the Vices of our Minister with great freedom, so he makes no difficulty to celebrate his Vertues.
Thus, Sir, I have presumed to lay before You the Design and Cha∣racter of this Performance; and tho'
 the World will justly tax me for dwelling so long upon this Article; yet of Two Evils, I rather chose to trespass upon Your Patience, than to offend Your Modesty, by pre∣tending, after the received custom of Dedications, to attempt Your Panegyrick: Unless that Considera∣tion kept me back, here is a Tem∣ptation that is not easily overcome. Your Extraction from the Illustri∣ous and ancient Family of the He∣riz, a Name sufficiently known in our English Baronage; Your obli∣ging Deportment and Generosity; Your early Acquaintance with the Belles Lettres; and, to crown all, so just a Knowledge of Mankind in so much Youth; by which you have already given the World an earnest of what Your Country and Your Friends may justly expect from Your maturer Years, are such fruitful Topicks, that 'tis almost as difficult to abstain from a pursuit
 of them, as 'tis to find them so happily joyned in any single Person. But I am conscious to my self that I have sufficiently incurr'd Your Displeasure, by drawing You out of Your beloved Retirement with this Publick Address; and therefore shall take care not to inflame the Reckoning, by engaging in a Pro∣vince, which after all, I am unfit to manage. All I pretend to, is to divert Your vacant Hours, when Your Friends and Affairs of greater Importance will permit You to take up with so sorry an Entertain∣ment; and to declare to the World with what Zeal and Sincerity I am,
SIR,
