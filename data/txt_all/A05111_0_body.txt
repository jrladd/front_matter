ALexander Kynge of Mace∣done (most Worshipfull Me∣caenas) not
so muche for his va∣lyaunt and martiall factes (althoughe they were most
vi∣ctorious) as for his great loue and ardente zeale whiche he bare to vertue
and knowledge, hathe bene of all men hade in moste worthie estimation and
goodlye memorye. Iob called the seruaunte of God, althoughe he was wor∣thie
to be praysed of all men for his iustice and equitye, yet he was moste
commended for his syngular patyence in tyme of tribulation and great
calamytie. But when I considere with my self your insatiable desyre and
moste fer∣uent loue, not onlye in the followynge of your owne studie, but
also in the promouinge and furtherynge of others: your greate patience and
incredible constance, in sufferynge affli∣ction and abydyng aequitie: I am
compelled to confesse that there is none neyther amongest the prophane
and ethnycke authours, neyther amongest thecclesyasticall and spyrytuall
fa∣thers  (of what estate or qualitie so euer they were)
with the whiche ye may not be compa∣red, yea or rather preferred. For yf
Alexan∣der were praysed that in the myddest of his triumphant victories he
dyd beare abrode with hym Ilyas the famous worke of homer containinge the
battayles and destruction of Troye: How muche more are ye to be com∣mended that
in the myddest of your calamitie doe bothe nyght and day where soeuer ye
be, carie and reade a more worthie and pretious worke? Alexander in
prosperitie tooke plea∣sure to reade Homere treactinge, of martiall factes,
to thende he mought guyde his armye accordinge to the exacte rule therin
decla∣red: ye take pleasure in aduersitie to reade the holye Scrypture and
worde of God, to thende ye may gouerne your lyfe accordyng to the wyll and
commaundemente of God. Where Ale∣xander was, there was prophane Homere: w∣here
ye are there is the holye Byble. When A∣lexander did sleape Homere was his
boulster: when ye doe sleape, the Byble is your pyllowe Alexander for all hys
ryches is praysed for the continuall reading of one booke: what shall I
then saye of you that haue bestowed no lyttle parte of your goodes in buiynge
of most  worthie workes. Iob whiche is set before our
eyes thexample of a syngular patience beinge extreamly afflicted in outward
thynges, and in hys bodye, throughe his great tormentes and afflictyons brasted
forthe into many incon∣uenyences both of wordes and sentences, and shewed
hym self as a desperate man in many thynges, and as one that woulde
resyst God, Ye hauynge no lesse occasion to complayne beinge moste
vniustly spoyled of your goods troubled in mynde and conscience, threatned
dayly by your ennemyes doe notwithstandin∣ge constantly resyste acknowledgyng
God to haue secret iudgments, to chastyse those fa∣therlye whome he
loueth, and to lette the re∣probate runne to destruction. These and other
your moste singular vertues hauinge conside∣red and experimented the good
will and mynd which you beare to the furtheraunce and set∣tyng forthe of all
sciences, I coulde fynde none more apte, or worthie vnder whose name this
golden treasure shoulde come abrode, then his whose vertue and good
behauiour, mighte geue some place and authoritie to the same. For al∣though
therebe many more adorned with ry∣ches and possessions of this worlde
yet in set∣tynge forthe of vertue and singuler patience I  fynde none at all. Nowe therfore to con∣clude (Sythens, I knowe you to
be most a∣lienated from all ambition) I beseeche you to receyue, this my
small presente in good part, hauing rather respecte to the mynde of the
giuer then to the gyfte it self, althoughe most pretious. So I committe you
to the protection of God almyghtie wishynge his heauenly Ma∣iestie, that ye
may constantlie perseuere as ye haue begonne, bothe in your spirituall and
temporall affaires, to thende that ye liuing godlie in this worlde maye obtayne
that hea∣uenly Crowne of glorie whiche our Sauiour Iesus Christe hathe
prepared to all those that doe patiently: watche for his appearynge to whome
withe the father and the holy Ghost be all laude, honour & prayse
worlde without ende.
