May it please Your Grace,
NO sooner was the Princess of Fess ready to appear in publick on our English World, but ambitious to Kiss Your Graces hands,
she is come to claim the protection of Your Illustri∣ous Name, not without all imaginable hopes of finding a favourable reception from that Person, whose quali∣ties are observ'd with such admiration, by those of the first rank in Vivacity of Wit and Profoundness of Judgment, who have Una∣nimously voted, that it is as easie for the distressed to find a Sanctuary in the Arms of Your Graces ge∣nerous Safeguard, as it is
difficult to be supply'd with apt expressions to set forth Your Graces perfections.
For my part, Madam, the Knowledge of my own difficiency has been a So∣vereign antidote against the vanity of endeavouring such an Herculian labour on my own bottom, and of attempting those impossibili∣ties, and when I have gone to borrow from the most exquisite of the Ancients Panegyricks, I have found all so short from Your
Graces Merits, that looking down with Con∣tempt on those little things which the Modern Writers have used in the setting forth of Your Graces Vir∣tues, I have avoyded the presumption, and rested Contented with the Honour of Subscribing my self,
May it please Your Grace,
