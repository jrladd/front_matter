MADAM,
WITH all possible Respect, and some Hopes it will not prove absolutely unwelcom, I Humbly lay at Your Majesty's Feet a very good Book, but a very ill-suited Present: For Devout Ink and Paper to Your Majesty, whose Life is it self a Book of Devotion, is
but a Link of Silver to a Chain of Gold. And then a Translation is such a kind of Present to Your Majesty, as a bad Copy to one who has an excellent Original. 'Tis true, you are an absolute Mistress of our Language, as well as Hearts; but you would never Pray in an Ʋnknown Tongue, though there were neither English nor Italian in the World; and Translating is but telling you a Story for News, which you know already, and hear when you please much better told. But since what is useless to Your Majesty, may be beneficial to your Subjects; and a Queen is neither the Greatest, nor the most Glorious of your Titles, I promise my self that your Charity will condescend
to make an Alms of your Name and Patronage; and by your coun∣tenance to Devotion, allure a Peo∣ple fond of making their Court to you, to make it in the way most pleasing to Your Majesty, straining to follow afar off, and be as De∣vout as they can, since few can hope to be as Devout as you.
'Tis to be hoped this will be the Courtship in fashion, now the Times are returned in which the Queens of England are Saints again; and the Fruit infinitely great, when People find the way to Heaven, is the way to be well at Court. I was Ambitious to make my Court this way, but to my shame, so poor a Courtier, that I was forc'd to bor∣row a Present, and to make it mine,
dress'd in a new Language, as we alter the property of Plate by a new Fashion. I know I have ex∣pos'd my unskilfulness in this Trade to the Eye in all England, which will the soonest discern it. But Your Majesty will have the goodness to reflect, that no Translation can ex∣press the beauty and force of the Original; to suffer the Argument to attone for all Faults, and to have some Indulgence for the Passionate Zeal and Profound Respect, with which I shall always be,
