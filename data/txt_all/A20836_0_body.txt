I Will not striue m'invention to inforce,
With needlesse words your eyes to entertaine,
T'obserue the formall ordinarie course
That euerie one so vulgarly doth faine:


Our interchanged and deliberate choise,
Is with more firme and true election sorted,
Then stands in censure of the common voice,
That with light humor fondly is transported:


Nor take I patterne of an others praise,
Then what my pen may constantly avow,
Nor walke more publique nor obscurer waies
Then vertue bids, and iudgement will allow;


So shall my loue, and best endeuours serue you,
And still shall studie, still so to deserue you.
