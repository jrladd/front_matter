PIthagoras the first in∣structer of the Greekes in misti∣call and profound Philosophie, and the earnest aduoucher of vnum bo∣num and ens, (who deliuered vnto his hearers the pith and substance of that knowledge and science that the Egyptian prophets, the Assirian Chaldes, the Brittaine Bards, the French Druids, the Bac∣trian Samanaei, the Persian Magi, the Indian Gimnoso∣phists, Anacharsis among the Scithians, in Thracia Za∣molxis, and further East the Brachman Iewes did in his time and before professe) hath laide downe three thinges, (right reuerend and honorable) as steps and degrees vnto perfect, complete and absolute felicitie. Laborem virtutis, qui in actione consistit, meditationem, quae multis disciplina∣rum studiis nutritur, & amorem qui nos vt necessarium vincu∣lum Deo connectit. The labour of vertue which consisteth in action, contemplation which is nourished by the studye of sundry sciences: and loue which as a necessarye knot, ioy∣neth vs vnto God: the first morall and ethicall, the second naturall and mathematicall, the third theologicall and de∣uine: All which three are so to be vnited and combined to∣gether, as none may be wanting or defectiue in him that shalbe so happie, as to attaine to the cheefest good, which though all men desire, yet the rough and narrowe waye of vertue and knowledge that leadeth ther-unto, dooth so de∣terre
most, & the broad & plain path of pleasure & world∣ly vanities that withdraweth therfro, doth so allure them, that as men bewitched & depriued of true Iudgement, they willingly goe whether they would not, & willingly forgoe what they most desire, which as a mistery most deeply to be waied, Pithagoras included in a character, the better to pre∣sent it to the viewe, and to imprint it in the minde of his hearers. The same vnto vs the eternall woord and wisedom of God, Christe Iesus the fountaine of true and heauenlye Philosophie, teacheth most cleerely in these woordes. En∣ter in at the straite gate, for it is the wide gate and broad way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which goe in ther∣at, because the gate is straight and way narrow, that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there be that finde it. And that which Tullie reciteth of Hercules out of Xenophon: Hercules (vt est apud Xenophontem) Cum primum pubesceret (quod tempus a natura ad deligendum, quam quisque viam viuendi sit ingres∣surus datum est) exisse in solitudinem dicitur, atque ibi seden∣tem diusecum multumque dubitasse, cum duas cerneret vias; vnam voluptatis, alteram virtutis, vtram ingredi melius esset. Falleth now no doubt in question with many which nei∣ther are of so heroicall a minde, as to make Hercules choice, nor of so godlye disposition as to follow Christs counsell, bid the way of vertue and veritie farewell, and shake hands with the path of vanitie and pleasure, wherof as graceles∣nes is the ground, so two speciall spurres ther-unto is faint∣hartednes and follye, not daring to oppose them-selues to the difficulties and incumbrances that they see in the one, sith virtus inuidiam; veritas odium parit, nor in wisdome foreseeing the mischeefe and misery wherin the other doth end, which is wel noted in the Greek Prouerbe. : falsum in extremis nigrescit, Vanitie and falsehood in his extreams is black, that is, what coullour so∣euer is cast ouer it, and how beautifull or faire soeuer it ap∣peere, the ende of it will be wretched, wofull and misera∣ble
to the which, that precept of Pithagoras tendeth : Ne gustes ex iis quibus est nigra cauda, that is, med∣dle not with those thinges whose end is doleful and lamen∣able. Clean contrary vnto these is vertue andveritie, which Homer represēteth by the hearb Moly, whose root is black, but whose flower is white, that is, whose beginning is dan∣gerous and difficulte, but the end & euent sweet, pleasant and prosperous, wherfore by the guiding of his spirit, who is the authour of all grace & goodnes, endeuouring to passe through the narrowe way, what obstacles and dangers soe∣uer I finde in it▪ and with the labour of vertue (mencioned by Pithagoras as the first step) to exercise my selfe, holding that notable saying of Ciceroes, as a principle neuer to be forgotten, Magis est secundum naturam pro omnibus genti∣bus (si sieri possit) conseruandis, aut iuuandis, maximos labo∣res molestiasque suscipere, imitantem Herculem illum (quem hominum fama beneficiorum memor in consilio coelestium col∣locauit, quam viuere in solitudine non modo sine vllis molestiis, sed etiam in maximis voluptatibus, abundantem omnibus copi∣is, vt excellas etiam pulchritudine et viribus. Quocirca opti∣mo quisque splendidissimoque ingenio longe illam vitam huic an∣teponit. I haue added ther-unto some studie and meditati∣on as the second degree, which not Pithagoras only in hu∣maine wisdome thought necessary to be ioyned vnto acti∣on, but also by deuine instruction our Christian profession teacheth vs, which is a warfare vpon the earth euer contem∣plating by faith and hope, and woorking continualllye by charitie. The coupling of which two, that woorthy Soul∣dier Monsieur Lanue, to lesse learned and vertuous, then martiall and valiant, which are the partes of a compleat Gentleman, (as Homer by assigning to Achilles, a Centaure for his Schoolmaister intimateth) in his discorses lately pub∣lished, pithily perswadeth. Of which my contemplation I haue heere sent your honor some fruite, being a meditati∣on and coniecturall discourse vpon the Hierographicall ca∣racters and letters found on certaine fished the 28. of
Nouember within six miles of Marstrand northward, neer vnto Solteror, in the Kingdome of Denmarke, the yeere 1587. in those northerne seas, whereof I haue entreated by considerations Polligraphicall, Theologicall, Thalmudicall, and Cabalisticall. and although in the last I might haue pro∣ceeded somewhat further by vnfolding the ten numerati∣ons, wherof I could haue shewed the first three to be sempi∣ternall and to intimate the mistery of the trinitie of the next seauen, fiue to be past, and that we are now in the sixt, to the which they attribute these tearmes. Sadai, Fundamen∣tum mundi, Sion, Deus viuus, Sabathum integrum, medium inter custodi & memento, Dies quinquagesima de Leuiathan, Ioseph, Iustus Salomon, Iusticia, robur, lignum scientiae boni & mali, foedus domini, areus testimonis gloria domini, fundamen∣tum, Prophetiae Dauid, Redemptio Seculum animarum, & that we are hencefoorth to expect the seauenth numeration, which is the Kingdome of Heauen and eternall Sabaoth, which they expresse by these tearmes. Adonai Regnum, vi∣ta, posteriora, Finis, Ecclesia Israelis, Sponsa in canticis canti∣corum, Regina coeli, Virgo Israell, Mysterium legis ab ore datae, Aquila, littera quarta tetragrammati, Regnum domus Dauid, Templum Regis, Dei Ianua, Archa faederis, & duae tabulae in ea, Dominus vniuersae terrae. Yet for breuitie I haue desisted, for that euery woord is a misterie, and euery numeration would require a volume to expound it. These my slender conceipts I thought good to lay down in writing, wishing that the flint of my dull endeuours, striking on the steele of these misticaltruethes, some little sparkes might arise to en∣lighten our mindes, to acknowledge our dueties, and glori∣fie our God, that obeying him loyally, fearing him filially, and trusting in him effectuallye, we may loue him ar∣dently, which is the third degree noted by Pi∣thagoras, and the very next step vnto perfect blisse and eternall felicitie.
