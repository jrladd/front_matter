Right Reverend and dear Brethren,
THE high esteem I have ever had of your Persons, and the great holinesse of your lives (desiring ever to be such my self, as I esteem you to be, except onely in your particular opinions, wherein ye dissent from all Protestant, yea, all Christian Churches in this World) had almost hindered me, from the publishing of these Considerations upon your Apologeticall Narra∣tion; esteeming, That it was not for any particular man, such as I am, to oppose himself to such a number of grave Divines, of so great learning, and so apparent Pietie: But on the other part, considering, that you, as my self, are but men, subject to humane frailtie, that ye know but in part, and con∣sequently
may erre in part, I thought, that this, which is in question betwixt you, and all the Churches in the Christian World, might be a part of your aberration in part, and of that which we know in part; And upon this consideration, esteemed it no lesse a part of my dutie, and Christian libertie, as a man, to oppose my self to five men, then for five men to oppose themselves to the common opinion of five hundred thousand, to so many learned, so many holy Divines, hun∣dreds, and thousands for one of you, no wayes inferiour to the learnedst, and best amongst you; And not onely to particular men, and Divines, but to so many, yea and those the most pure, and most Reformed Churches of the World, amongst whom there have been found so many thousands who have sealed Christs Truth with the losse of their goods, imprison∣ment of their bodies, by the exile of their Persons, yea, with their dearest blood, and lievs, who if they wrought not miracles, at the least God declared his Almighty Power in working miracles about them, and upholding them; (Men of so great worth, that the world was not worthy of them: And howsoever these Motives be great, yet wrought they not so much upon me as this, That I am perswaded in my conscience, that your opinion of Independency, &c. if it were admitted (pardon my expression till I be better instruct∣ed by you, or some others) could not but prove the root of all sort of Schisme, and Heresie, and consequently the utter overthrow of Christs Universall Militant Church here upon Earth. Besides all these considerations, I had many more, and amongst the rest, your hard expressions against them that love, and pity you, your apparent resolution in desiring a Toleration of your Religion, and consequently of a Sepa∣ration from our Churches, which howsoever they have power to hinder you, yet condescend to be suppliants to you, that you will entertain union, and communion with them. I may adde
to all these your undervaluing of the Parliaments great Fa∣vours towards you; for ye know, Brethren, how they (not∣withstanding all this, and your former Separation from all other Christian Churches) having taken to heart your hard usage in those evill times ye speak of, (howsoever in respect of your number ye be very few, yea hardly the hundreth part, yea not so much as one part of the Divines of this Kingdom, in respect of your Separation) invited you most lovingly to be Members of this present Assembly of the most learned, holy, and reverend Divines of both Kingdoms; whereof, had not they given you the capacity, ye had been altogether incapable: And not onely that, but also having resolved to send two Divines from hence with their Commis∣sioners to Scotland, they honoured one of you with this high favour (the greatest they could confer upon you at that time) and so in effect did honour you with the half of the honour, which belonged to all the Divines of the Kingdom; And yet notwithstanding all these great testifications of so great, and tender affections towards you, ye five men, five Members of the Assembly, (by whose Counsell, and Instigation, or up∣on what Motives we know not) joyned your selves in a parti∣cular Combination, without the knowledge of either Par∣liament or Assembly, to draw up and publish unto the World an Apologeticall Narration, as ye terme it, containing in effect, (howsoever ye name it) a singular desire of Separa∣tion from them, that so cherish you, with some unworthy Nick-names, ye put upon them, who stile you by no worse names, then Brethren. By such proceedings, what else have ye done, but erected an Assembly in the Assembly, a parti∣cular Assembly in a publike Assembly, by private Authority against publike Authority, taking private Resolutions against all publike Resolutions, whatsoever might be concluded ei∣ther in Parliament, or Assembly; and in one word, an Assem∣bly
to overthrow the Assembly? These reasons joyned together with sundry others, made me to think more then I say, and to suspect that ye would say more then ye say. And therefore, laying all particular affections aside, I resolved my self to publish these following Considerations, and Annotations upon this your Apologeticall Narration; which truely I do not out of any spleen against you (God knows it) for never one of you, ever offended me; yea, I may say, that I love you all from my heart, and that in writing of this, my soul is, as it were, rent in two parts, my understanding carrying it one way, and my will another; Christs verity forcing the one, and your singular piety alluring the other: But I must conclude, That it is better to follow God then man, what ever he be, or may appear to be; and that the will, that is but a blinde facultie, must let it self be led by the light of the understanding, which is the eye of the soul. And as I write not out of spleen, so may I attest him, who seeth all things, that I do it not to gain any mans affection, or favour, much lesse in hope of any other worldly ends; and that if I did it to gain any mans love, or friendship, I am as much desirous of yours, as any others: No such ends moved me: But if I have any knowledge of my self at this present, at the writing of this Answer (which yet I know is not such as it should be) I may say, That my main aym has been Gods glory, and the edification of weak Brethren, who may have been misled by your most learned Discourse; esteeming, that during the rest of my Pilgrimage, which cannot be long, having no other thing to do, I shall do well to do this, and so improve my Talent to his glory, the Edification of his Church, and the Salvation of my own Soul, and so I remain
