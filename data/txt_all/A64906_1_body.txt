Right Hon: and Worshipfull,
THis Booke hath beene Eight severall times im∣printed, and as at the first time, so ever since in every Impression in hath beene dedicated to the Governours of your Hospitall: The Excellency and necessity of it easily appeareth by the often reprinting thereof: And the times now requiring a Ninth im∣pression, I would not so much forget my selfe or wrong You, as to Publish it without due Dedication to your Honour and Wor∣ships. If You please to vouchsafe it Patronage, and my Service in the Dedication thereof your acceptance, I shall ever rest obliged;
