IT is now two yeares, since part of these ensuing Pa∣pers, like the publike issue of the people, imperfect and undressed, were ex∣posed, without a Parent to protest them, or any hand to nourish them. But since your Most Sacred Majesty was pleased graciously to looke upon them, they are growne into a Tract, and have an am∣bition (like the Gourd of Jonas) to dwell in the eye of the Sunne from whence they received life and increment. And although, because some violence hath

been done to the profession of the do∣ctrine of this Treatise, it may seem to be verbum in tempore non suo, and like the offering Cypresse to a Conquerour, or Palmes to a broken Army, yet I hope I shall the lesse need an Apology, be∣cause it is certaine, he does really dis∣serve no just and Noble interest, that serves that of the Spirit, and Religion. And because the sufferings of a KING and a Confessour are the great demon∣stration to all the world that Truth is as Deare to your MAJESTY as the Iewells of your Diademe, and that your Con∣science is tender as a pricked eye, I shall pretend this onely to alleviate the incon∣venience of an unseasonable addresse, that I present your MAJESTY with a humble persecuted truth, of the same constitution with that condition where∣by you are become most Deare to God, as having upon you the characterisme

of the Sonnes of God, bearing in your Sacred Person the markes of the Lord Jesus, who is your Elder Brother, the King of Sufferings, and the Prince of the Catholique Church. But I consi∣der that Kings, and their Great Coun∣cels, and Rulers Ecclesiasticall have a speciall obligation for the defence of Li∣turgies, because they having the greatest Offices, have the greatest needs of auxi∣liaries from Heaven, which are best pro∣cured by the publike Spirit, the Spirit of Government and Supplication. And since the first, the best, and most Solemne Li∣turgies and Set formes of Prayer were made by the best and greatest Princes, by Moses, by David, and the Sonne of David; Your MAJESTY may be pleased to observe such a proportion of circumstances in my laying this [Apo∣logy for Liturgy] at Your feet, that pos∣sibly I may the easier obtaine a pardon

for my great boldnesse; which if I shall hope for, in all other contingencies I shall represent my selfe a person indiffe∣rent whether I live or die, so I may by either, serve God, and Gods Church, and Gods Vicegerent, in the capaci∣ty of,
Great Sir,
