Most Illustrious, and most Excellent Lord;
IT is now a good space since that I found my self engaged to pub∣lish
to the world, the Obligations, which I owe to the Merits of your Excellency: And I began a few years past, to confesse in part, this my engagement in the Dedication of my Mercury's Grove to your Excellency: But that Work having incountred a gale of adverse For∣tune, which detained it in the Presse untill now; I have been presented with an occasion of pub∣lishing, out of Complacency to o∣thers, this little Piece, a birth of the more happy years of my youth; and being unwilling to let it escape, without satisfaction in this also to my obligation, I have made it to bear in it's Front, as it's Tutelar Numen, the most renowned Name of your Excellency. Nor ought this work, because it contains the calamities of a Lover, equally in∣jur'd
by Love, and Fortune, to be therefore though unworthy of your Excellencie's perusall; for the Loves of this Knight being made Legiti∣mate, by Virtue and Constancy, they merit the Reading, and with∣all the Compassion of all Noble and Generous Souls, that know, and knowing can tell how to ma∣nage so Noble and Generous a Pas∣sion, in terms of Honour and Fide∣lity. And to whom more proper∣ly doth this Romance belong, fraught with the Passages and Adventures of Love, and Fortune; of Courtesy, and Honesty; of Magnanimity and Generosity; than to your Excel∣lency, Mirrour of all the Noble Vir∣tues, and Endowments, that render your Excellency Honourable, and Considerable to any, that have at∣tained the least knowledge of, or
acquaintance with them? Be plea∣sed to accept the Loyalty and the Love of this Knight, which with Reverence consecrates to the Im∣mortality of his Glory, that Fide∣lity and Obsequy which constitutes me,
