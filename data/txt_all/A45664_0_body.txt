MADAM,
THere's none I can so safe∣ly come unto for Shelter to my first Labours as Your self, in whose Na∣ture, Justice and Equity, are so firmly established, that your

Name prefixed to this Book, is not only able to defend it from Calumny, but also to cover a great many Faults may be found in it.
If I should declare my Obli∣gations to lay this Work at your Feet, this Epistle would swell to a greater Bulk than the Book it self: For who could enu∣merate all your Endowments, or my own particular Ties in less space? Who can sufficiently declare that profuseness of Na∣ture, who, ordinarily, giveth some Excellency to one, some to ano∣ther, but has Concentrated all in You: Who did ever see No∣bility such a debonaire Countenance, such exact and divine proportion of Body, Politeness of Mind, and Pleasantness in Conversation, so blended and mixed in a Crea∣ture?

so that I'm at a stand, whe∣ther I should say, That they are the Attendants of your Birth, or much rather, since they are not to be found in your Equals, I could almost think that Nobi∣lity and Riches are but the Ear∣nest of the Reward of so great Vertues. Madam, I am hardly restrain'd from breaking in up∣on Them, but I fear I should wander in this vast Field and inextricable Labyrinth. Where∣fore, I do truly value my self, that I have resisted so great a Temp∣tation, in not launching out into this Ocean, in improving the Subject before me in Panegy∣rick. Yet I cannot so entirely moderate my Passion, but I must say, That the great Prudence whereby you have managed and improved That Estate, in the Minority of your most Noble

Son, is a most plain Declaration of the most of the other Ver∣tues.
But that I may not offend a∣gainst your Modesty, I must keep off, and tell you in short, That this Dedication is the Basket of Flowers the poor Man presenteth his Rich Neighbour with. Yet, worthless things receive a value, when they are made the Offer∣ings of Respect, Esteem, and Gra∣titude: These I have in the highest degree for You; so that if they can add a Price to what they go along with, proportio∣nable to their own Greatness, I can with confidence brag, I here make your Ladyship the greatest Present you ever received. This I am sure, I am under the great∣est obligation to seek all occasi∣ons to acknowledge; and I

should be most Ungrateful, if I did not lay hold on this Oppor∣tunity, to testify to the World, how much I am obliged to be,
MADAM,
