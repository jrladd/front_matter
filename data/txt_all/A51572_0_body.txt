Paul Isaiah, a converted Jew, wisheth all happinesse of body and soule, both in this life and the next, through Christ Je∣sus our Lord.
Reverend Sir,
THE many favours which I have re∣ceived from you, as to the refreshing of body, with the outward

things of this life, and to the comforting of my soul, with your most Christi∣an instructions, and spiri∣tuall consolations, have emboldened me thus to re∣turne you my thanks, and to make publick Testimo∣ny unto the world, how much I am obliged to you; and I hope I shall not doe injury to your goodnesse, by openly publishing my gratitude, as also by cra∣ving your further counte∣nance towards me and my poor endeavours, that this

discourse between a Chri∣stian and a Jew, written by the greatly learned Sebasti∣an Munster, may goe a∣broad under your name.
The discourse was first written by him in the He∣brew Tongue wch is a lan∣guage, wherein I know you had rather read it, then in my Englsh. But since my dear and blessed Savior, has been gratiously pleased to cal me into his Vineyard, I have resolved by his grace, not to be idle in it, but shall most gladly set my selfe to

any worke, whereby I may advantage the Christian cause, though it bee but by knocking a pinne into the Building, or by bringing a little Goats haire to furnish the Ark. They that could not offer a Lamb, were ac∣cepted if they brought only a Pigeon. And I read in the Holy Gospell, where Christ commended the wi∣dow that gave into the Treasury, but two Mites.
And as for my selfe, I hope I shal not be rejected, though my present worke

bee onely a Translation; wherein yet I would be ve∣ry gladly emploied, might I be so happy, as to be ac∣quainted by your learned selfe or some others, with what books are written in Hebrew, which would bee most usefull in the Christi∣an Church, by being tran∣slated into English.
For as in former times the Gibeonites lived among my Countrie men the Jewes, as hewers of wood, and drawers of water; so I that am a Jew by birth,

though now by God's grace a Christian, doe de∣sire to live and be service∣able to the Christian Church, though it bee by performing the meanest offices, since King David himself thought it would no way disparage him, to be a dore-keeper in God's house.
The Lord of his great mercie preserve the whole Church, and add dailie unto it (even from among my native Countrie men, the Jewes) such as shall bee

saved; which is the dai∣lie praier of him who Ho∣nours you, and begs your favourable interpretation of this his presumption.
Reverend Sir,
