RIght Honourable, in S∣tember
last was twel
month, I redeemed m
selfe prisoner from Sal
being sent out Mast
and Pilote in a Sally ma
of warre, with twenty
one Moores and five Flemish rennagadoes, un
the coast of England to take Christians, brough
them into the Isle of Wight under the co∣mand
of Husk Castle, where I was detained
a Pirate, and sent to Winchester with the re

till wee were tryed by the Law, then com∣ming
to London very bare, I found much fa∣vour
at your Honours hands; For which I
must ever rest ingaged, and have no way to
testifie my thankfulnesse more, than by pre∣senting
this my poore indevour to your Ho∣nour:
which if you please to accept and con∣sider
of, may be a meanes to relieve more as
you have done mee; for my onely sonne is
now slave in Areire, and but ten yeares of
age, and like to be lost for ever, without
Gods great mercy and the Kings clemencie,
which I hope may be in some measure ob∣tained
by your Honours meanes, and then
your poore suppliant shall be ever bound to
pray for you and yours all his dayes,
and ever rest at your command,
