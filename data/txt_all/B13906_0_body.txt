SIR:
MEn, that can speake, would heare much in few. It is not much that I can doe this way, and therefore it is but little that I will say. Only to three Quae∣rees (viz.) why (of many) these Sermons were thus, First, Preached: Secondly, Printed: Thirdly, Dedicated? I answer
To the first thus: As in Feasts, so in Ser∣mons we respect the company, not our selues. These two were preached in A∣thens,
1 Cor. 9.22. & 10.33. and there Saint Paul (whose Rule in these middle things is Omnia omnibus) somewhat varies his stile, and speakes thicke, Act. 17.
To the second thus: these were most and first desired, and we carry Sermons to the presse, as seruants bring drink to the table, only when it is called for.
To the third thus: First,
A cuius latere nun∣quam discessi quin, &c. for my owne priuate, I owe very much to your loue,
for many most kinde fauours, most faith∣full counsels, most fruitfull instructions. Secondly, I am willing to pay what I am able, and to commend the rest to the pray∣ers of my Executors and Assignes. And se∣condly for the publike, not only I, but all the Churches giue you thanks, partly for releeuing so many poore members and bowels, partly for adorning Religion with reall performances, whilst others talk, and with attending the maine, whilst too ma∣ny languish in liuelesse disputes. Goe on (Good Sir) you are in a good way, and you serue a good Master. I know not whom the Lord hath blessed beyond your selfe, in person, condition, profession, relation, suc∣cession, euery way: should not you be ve∣ry thankfull, who should? Now the Lord giue you to abound yet and yet, more and more,
Philip. 1.9. In his vltin. is & pessunis tempori∣bus, &c. as Paul speakes: and he grant, that in these last & worst daies (as Bernard yokes them) we all may keepe our faith, truth, innocency,
Reuel. 16.19. conscience, and the rest of out garments cleane & close about vs. Amen.
From my Study, Decemb. 20.
