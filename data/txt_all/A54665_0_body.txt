My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Have at last demolishd those difficulties which in∣tercepted this Work, in that progress it endevoured to make, to offer it self up both to yours and the pub∣lick view. Yet I do not deny, in a Peice made rugged with so many knots, several Mistakes and Omissions must (through Inad∣vertency and Mis-information) have slip'd in; some of which had their first extraction from the Presse, and some their birth from my Pen: All which I have collected into a Table of Addenda, which is imme∣diately subsequent to the Preface, whither the Rea∣der may retire to disperse all scruples.
Secondly, I have not added any Numerical Al∣phabet, to direct the Reader, since the Book is so Alphabetically digested, that the Work is a Dire∣ctory Beam or Ray to it self: To which I have an∣nex'd, as an Appendage, a particular Description of all the circumambient Kentish Islands.
Thirdly, I have not so tyed my self up to those severer Discourses which I have extracted from either publick or private Record, but that I have embroi∣der'd this Peice with Discourses of a softer com∣plexion;
as at Bilsington, I have unfolded the Cau∣ses of the Depravation of the ancient Clergy, both in Doctrine and Manners; at Birling I have disco∣vered the nature of that Tenure, Antiquity call'd Tenure per Baroniam; at Ewell I have unravell'd the first Institution of the Knights Templers, and the probable causes of their total extirpation; at New∣ington Lucies I have discours'd largely of Ʋrne En∣terment; at Rodmersham, no less of the Institution of the Knights Hospitallers; at Werth I have trea∣ted of the Antiquity of Seals; at Wymings Would, of the Ancient Dignity of the Pileus; and have at several other places enterlac'd this Work with colla∣teral Discourses of the same tincture.
Whatsoever this Peice may appear in the whole Frame and Bulk of it, I do assure you it was not born without your Influence, it is ready to die at your Command, and cannot live but by your Ac∣ceptance. But I know you have both Art and Can∣dor; and as I cannot but hope, but that a merciful Interpretation will be emergent from the first, so I cannot doubt but the last will give so noble an Allay to your Justice, that if it cannot totally absolve, yet it may at least excuse
(My Lords and Gentlemen)
