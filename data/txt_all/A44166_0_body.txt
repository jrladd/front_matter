May it please your Lordship,
THis Discourse preached at the Assizes at Leicester, and now Printed at the Request of the High Sheriff, Grand Jury, and other principal Gentry of the Countrey, I presume to lay at your Lordship's Feet, and hum∣bly beg for it and the Author your Lordship's Friendship and Patronage, which my Relations never wanted from your noble Ancestors. Nothing

but its Plainness, Honesty and Loyalty could re∣commend it to the Auditory, consisting most of your Lordship's Tenants and Neighbours; and those Recommendations, I am sure, will welcom it to your Honor; which therefore I most humbly entreat your Lordship to accept as a Testimony of a grateful Mind, for those manifold Favours which my Relations for many Generations have received from your honourable Ancestors; and for those I have so often, and so lately experienced my¦self from your Lordship; and as an Earnest and Pledge that I shall always behave my self as be∣comes
