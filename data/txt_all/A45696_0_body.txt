Right Honourable,
IT is ascribed to Sir William Paulet for Pru∣dence, that in four several Kings and Queens reigns, which were obnoxious to perillous Innovations, he demeaned
himself so observantly and cautiously in those tempestuous and dange∣rous times, that he con∣stantly held his head a∣bove water and augmen∣ted his advancement, when numerous Noble personages were plunged in their abyss: And have not there happened al∣most as many pernicious mutations and factions within these four years in this State, as were in the Roman Republique for the space of five hundred? wherein your Honour hath so circumspectly and
vigilantly steered your course, that you have not only shunned shipwrack, which many others did suffer, but have also fixed your bottom in the har∣bour of felicity, and at this present with the ap∣plause and approbation of all men, do sit at the helm of this Commonwealth.
Istuc est sapere, qui ubicun{que} opus sit animum possit flectere.Terent. Hecyr.
And the Author cordially wisheth that you may e∣qual,Sir Will. Paulet live within 3 years of one hun∣dred. if not exceed the years of that famous Councellor of State, that
(as he did) by your grave direction and sage advice to the great Council of this Commonwealth, and by its provident resolves, Tranquillity and peace may be setled in these Na∣tions, and a firm Union established and preserved in them. To which pur∣pose the Author hath been induced to present to your Honour this im∣polite History concerning the Union of these Nati∣ons, as Marcus Terentius Varro did his Book de ori∣gine linguae Latinae to Marcus Tullius Cicero, not
by way of instruction to admonish you, but by way of reference to be censu∣red by you as an equal ar∣bitrator, whether it be worthy of the publique light, and may tend to the publique good, which is the butt & burthen of his labours; wherein he hath had an especial care accor∣ding to his skill; that as Po∣libius prescribeth soli  bentati litaret, he should sacrifice solely to truth; and that neither for any mister conceit he should detract from any, or for any favourable respect
flatter any, but to pou∣trait every person accor∣ding to his just propor∣tion: And if it be con∣ceived that in some passages he hath acciden∣tally slipped, seeing he hath endeavoured to a∣scend the higher and slip∣pery places, he hopeth well that your Honour will be pleased to pardon his slips and over-sights, they proceeding from imbecillity and not per∣tinacy, and to cover them with his good intentione that you will be as equal towards him, as he is to∣wards
the great God, whom he knoweth not to have given all things to one man. So be∣seeching the Almighty to lengthen your days to the great good of this Commonwealth, he sub∣missively taketh his leave.
