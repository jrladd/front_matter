SIR,
THis little and unpolish'd Tract (by reason of its Authors pensive Thoughts, concerning its Enter∣tainment among the Critic Cen∣surists of this Carping Age, and his careful Solicitude, to whose Patronage he dare presume to commit it) is just like a small
Vessel tossed up and down in the midst of a turbulent Ocean, and buffered by the swelling Waves of an unruly Element, having its Sails lacerated by the boiste∣rous Assaults of an unmerciful Wind, and not knowing to what Port or Haven it had best be∣take it self: For when I seriously reflect on my own Unworthiness and Insufficiency, for a Work of this Nature, I am ashamed to think of exposing the Weak∣ness and Imperfection of my Juvenile Labours to Public View, much more when I contemplate on the Dignity and Grandure of your Person, the multitude of your Natural and Acquired Ac∣complishments, the Profound∣ness
of your Judgment, and the Accuracy of your Discerning Fa∣culty, am I Astonisht, and e∣ven stand Agast at the thoughts of appearing at the open Bar be∣fore so Discerning a Judge. But yet on the other side, when I con∣side you Candour and Cle∣mency, the Natural Result and Product of such a Genuine Dis∣position, as inclines you to Par∣don and Overlook the common Frailties of Mankind; the Weight and Argument in this last Con∣sideration, to publish it, proe∣ponderates that of the two former to keep it dormant: so that now ha∣ving resolved to strike Anchor at the safe Harbour of your Name here prefixed, my fluctu∣ating
Thoughts are already re∣duced to Calmness and Sereni∣ty of Mind; and I value not the inconsiderable Puffs and Blasts of a thousand Censurists but can Laugh at all their Taunts and Jeers, and Calumnies. Or shall I compare it to a Ship embarked with Goods (tho very ordina∣ry) intended for a long Voyage, and fore-seeing a multitude of Storms and Tempests, which it must unavoidably venter thro, yet having a Skilful and Successful Pilot to steer its Course, is not much concerned at those Perils, which otherwise would undoubt∣edly cause a Shipwrack?
Shall I also compare it to an
Infant, which in the very Exit from the close Confinement of its Mothers Womb, and in the mid'st of its Pangs, wants a Skil∣ful Midwife to hasten its De∣livery. Thus Sir (to apply the Allegory) if this Partus, freed from the teeming Womb of its Authors Brain, wherein it was conceived and ushered Naked into the open World, doth but live, being Received and Embraced by suck as are Well-wishers to those good Intentions that begat it; it must acknowledge its Life and Entertainment in the World, to be solely derived from you who would so Candidly Vouchsafe to obstetricate it.

Therefore Worthy Sir, presum∣ing upon your Benignity, I shall wholly devote it to your Patro∣nage, and must assure you, that tho it be not a spurious Brat, yet I dare not acknowledge to be its Parent or own it to be my Legi∣time Off-spring, unless you will deign to make it yours Ado∣pted.
And tho it may be rather cal∣led an Embrio than a perfect Partus, it being Fraught with many Imperfections, by reason of its Parent's Infirmity, yet I hope the Consideration of this will rather excite you to Commise∣rate it than cause you to Disdain to Look on it; for certainly it
had ere this proved Abortive had it not continued to this (small) Maturity, meerly being sustained by the hopes of your Readiness and Willingness to render your Aid and Assistance in the extre∣mity of its Exit, and in the neces∣sitous time of this its Delivery.
Sir, It is not because I think any Benefit will accrue to you by your Inspection into this Dis∣course, or that it will any way add to your Knowledge that I pre∣sent it to you, but knowing that you have a Genius which inclines you to such Studies as these, as well to more sublime ones, I can∣not but hope that you will En∣courage the same, where you see it in others, and by a kind Ac∣ceptance
and a candid Resent∣ment of these my Endeavours, manifest the same.
Besides your willingly Patro∣nizing somewhat of my Fathers (tho on another Subject) some years since, was a great induce∣ment to make me hope and ex∣pect the same unparell'd Favour from you; which humble Request, if you will condescend to grant▪ you will for ever oblige him who really is
London, Jan. 29th. 1679.
Sir,
