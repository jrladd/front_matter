SIR,
YOU are very desirous to obtain a faithful Narrative (a Ca∣pite ad Calcem) of these wonderful and almost unparallel'd Fits wherewith Mr. Thomas Spatchet was afflicted for some years: I here present it to your view, as a matter that deser∣veth to be had in remembrance in Ages to come.
I have lived some Miles distant from the place of his abode; but yet coing often thereabouts, I had the advantage to be an Eye-wit∣ness of a great part of what you find in this Story, and more I had from his own mouth; for he was always free to declare how it wa with him before many Witnesses.
The various passages seemed to me so remarkable, as from time to time I could not but commit them writing, for a memorial of them; and I suppose some others have done the like, yea many (if they have not yet) might have done it; for this was no private business, but commonly known in this Country.
I submit it to your Iudgment, whether all proceeded from a Natural Cause, or a Diabolical.
He still findeth those shatterings in his head (within mentioned) in Religious Duties, at some times, especially if he travelleth beyond his strength.
I shall add no more but this, that the wording of it is not all his, but partly mine, and therefore I must crave excuse for failures there∣in. I have expressed as clearly as I could those wonderful Works of God, and I am glad I can tell you, that he hah made the latter end, letter than the beginning.
