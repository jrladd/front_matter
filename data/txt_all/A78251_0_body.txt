SIR,
THis poore Pamphlet I intended at first should have kis∣sed your Royall hands at Hampton-Court, not that I conceived it a Present worthy the acceptance of a King, but on∣ly I presumed, that Loyalty being a precious Jewell in this age, could not be unwelcome, though presented from the mea∣nest, and the most unworthy of your Subjects.
Some perswasions of your true Friends first put me upon the Enterprise, and urged to me a necessity, that it should be done out of hand, that all your loyall Subjects might be informed in what a sad condition you lay, and how miserably you have been abused from time to time: so that it being the Producti∣on of but a day and a night (a little more time than Nature takes to the making of a Mushrome,) nothing can be expected in it but plaine Truth hudled together without any artifici∣all method or dressing. And yet I hope it will find your Ma∣jesty out in this your happy retirement; wherein if it speake but any tolerable sence to entertain your Majesty for an houre, and such as may take Impression upon the hearts of your Sub∣jects, then (though done in hast) it is well done.
