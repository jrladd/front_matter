SIR,
'TIS no small Reflection on Pieces of this nature, that Panegyrick is so much improv'd, and that Deication is grown more an Art than Poetry; that Authors, to make their Patrons more than Men, make themselves less; and that Persons of Honour are forc'd to decline patronizing Wit, because their Modesty cannot bear the gross Strokes of Adulation.
But give me leave to say, Sir, that I am too young an Author to have learnt the Art of Flattery; and, I hope, the same Modesty which recommended this Play to the World, will also reconcile my Addresses to You, of whom I can say nothing but what your Merits may warrant, and all that have the honour of your Acquaintance will be proud to vindicate.
The greatest Panegyrick upon you, Sir, is the unpreju∣diced and bare Truth of Your Character, the Fire of Youth, with the Sedateness of a Senatour, and the Modern Gaity of a fine English Gentleman, with the noble Solidity of the Antient Britton.
This is the Character, Sir, which all men, but your self, are proud to publish of You, and which more celebrated Pens than mine should transmit to Posterity.
The Play has had some noble Appearances to honour its Representation; and to compleat the Success, I have pre∣sum'd to prefix so Noble a Name to usher it into the World. A stately Frontispiece is the Beauty of a Build∣ing. But here I must transverse Ovid:
Materia superabit Opus.
I am, Honourable Sir,
