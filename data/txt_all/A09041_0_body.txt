SIrrha Iacke, it fareth with me, as with a fearefull and faint-hearted Souldior, that being danted at the brunt of Wars, would faine betake himselfe vnto his heeles; or as some humorous or fantastick Painter, who falling in dislike with his owne workmanshippe, dasheth out that in a moment, which he framed not in a month. I once was willing to publish these ydle rimes, which then I recko∣ned without mine hoast (as thinking on the Suruayors, but not controulers heereof) for to their doome and indignation I either must submit my selfe, or yeeld to be beatē with mine owne Incke-horne. Alasse you see tis but the silly Mouse, I onely aime at, for any greater or more venomous vermine, I leaue them altogether to the cunning Rat-catcher, (my little trap being much too weake and vnable to hold them.) Thy counsell gentle Iohn) comes now to late in this extre¦mity or rather ambiguity of difference, that should haue held my peace (thou wile say) till mine accusers had brought their actions; wherunto I might better haue pleaded, Non est factum, then rashly thus in Publicum proripere: But seeing that which is done, cannot be now vndone, I must ad∣uenture the worst that may come, Semel insaniuimus om∣nes, and theres my rest. Farewell.
