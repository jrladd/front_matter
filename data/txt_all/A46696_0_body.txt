MADAM,
THat Trifles should be made Presents to persons of qua∣lity, or that these worthless lines, should court the Eye of Ho∣nour, are faults that scarce any will pardon but Your Ladiship,
whose Goodnes is as Great as your Beauty is Glorious. 'Twas That animated my presumpti∣on in presenting this piece to Your Honour: for being so much divine in every thing else, You must be so in Goodnes, and accept a Mite from him, who is unable to make a more stately offering. The design Lady of the Book is not to make any addition to Your spotles fea∣tures, but to borrow that from You which it promiseth to o∣thers Beauty and Splendour.
Madam,
