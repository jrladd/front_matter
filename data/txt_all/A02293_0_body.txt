RIght Noble, I not onely directed by the glorious Gueuara in this example and treatise which he de∣dicated vnto a noble man of Spaine, & in singular fauor with the Emperour Charles the fifte, but also constreyned with the oppression and bur∣then of your bountie, wanting all other mean either of abilitie or facultie, to dis∣couer my dutiful affection, with the more boldnes, not without regard of the mild∣nes of your humanitie, with an humble

feare to be noted of mine owne parte, of some presumption, or want of due consi∣deration of any imperfection of the mat∣ter, do present, respecting your age & ho∣nour annexed vnto the rare vertues of fortitude and temperance, with the ex∣perience of the sea and sea matters, with shippes and shipping, wherein approued trial, no lesse worthie credite, hath made knowne vnto all persons not insensible: your readines & aptnes in all weathers, to manure not only the meanest matters, as all maner of cordage and tackle with∣in boord, namely sheat, halliard, bowline, tacke and helme, with such other, as also the vse and practise of the Astrolobe, Balistilio, Carde and Compasse: but also the diligent searche in knowledge, of all capes, forelands, shores, portes, creekes, hauens, races, tides, bankes, and rockes. All which things although not vsuall to

Noble men, & yet most necessarie vn∣to all manner persons that haunteth the seas: expresseth kinde to be an assured guide, to yeld vnto your honour more ex∣pertnes then is common or easily obtey∣ned, to be heyre and successour of Nep∣tunes charge and gouernement. This small treatise, (as a subiecte in nature) were it of worthines sufficient, most due vnto your honour: but barren prouision impayring my good meaning, forceth me to present vnto your honour, the handfull of water, (as it were) which was presen∣ted vnto the mightie Artaxerxes, who with such mildnes did accepte the same, that he said no lesse noblenesse did consist in receyuing small thinges, then to giue great and mightie giftes. Right humbly beseeching, that it may please your ho∣nour, not onely to receiue this simple pre∣sent in good part, but my sincere meaning

into your good fauour: and I shall not cease with fortified minde to craue the omnipotent GOD to giue your Honour large and vertuous increase to the noble∣nes of your minde, as also the concluding and most absolute felicitie, which yeel∣deth happines in all worlds.
