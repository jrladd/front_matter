My Lord,
WERE not the Sub∣ject of these Papers, and the End they aim at, of the greatest Mo∣ment, I durst not have adventur'd

them to your Lordship: For, as for what ever I may have perform'd in them, I know it to be far more beneath the Heights of the Ori∣ginal, than David, when he coun∣terfeited the Mad-man before A∣cish, was unlike that David, who returning with the Spoils of the Philistin, was met in triumph by the Daughters of Israel; and his Conquest over that One Monster, was sung above the thousands of Saul. My aim then is not Praise, which I thus unfeignedly acknowledge, not to be due: and therefore am not so vain, as to think they will ever be receiv'd into the place of those now us'd; which have the same fortu∣nate, and ill luck with us, as the Mathematicians of Old had at

Rome; still to be reteyn'd, yet still condemn'd. All I shall hope for, is, that having first obteyn'd His Pardon, who, not requiring our exact, but our utmost possible per∣formances, will accept the faithful Endeavours, and pardon the fail∣ings of the Weak and Impotent: I may have the like Measures from Your Lordship; and from all such as Your Lordship; who endeavouring to express in themselves the Image of their Maker, will, as himself does, re∣mit to those who have no other end but to edeavour to celebrate his Praise, and promote the Good of o∣thers, the infelicities of their Suc∣cess. Which I cannot but hope from Your Lordship, not only from Your Lordships Noble inclinations to such

in general; but from Your Lordships particular Favour to your Servant; which, begun so many years past, in that Society, to which Your Lord∣ship is so confess'd an Honour, Your Lordship has been pleas'd to continue hitherto; and to look back upon, and know him yet, at that distance of Fortune, in which Your Lordship so eminently, and so deserv'dly stands. The God of Heaven multiply his Graces on Your Lordship here; and assign You your Portion hereafter among the Pious and the Just.
My Lord,
