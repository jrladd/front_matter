Sir,
I Own a very great Obligation for those Papers you were pleased to entrust me with so freely as you did, and at the first request; and though it be now five or six years since you writ them, yet I know they will be hugely welcome to the publick; and the World will be informed, that what is now prosecuted, is in truth a matter of consequence, and not a caprice of young un∣practis'd heads, as some endeavour to render it, but managed seriously by men of the ablest of the Profession, and worthy of the care and consideration of our Supe∣riours. And pray give me leave in a few words to acquaint you with the occasion I had to desire them of you at first.
It was my good fortune not long since to be in the Company of five or six persons, not only considerable for their Estates and Interest in the City, but likewise for their mature understanding of business: as they were discoursing of seueral matters relating to the Trade both of the City and Nation in general, it happened that one past through the room in which they sat, to go up a pair of stairs that lead into a Chamber, where the only Son of the Gentleman, at whose House they were, then lay under some little Aguish distemper: One of
 the Company that spyed him, saluted him by his name, which occasioned another to demand who it was; to whom the Gentleman of the House replyed, it was his Apothecary gone up to visit his Son who was at that time a little indisposed; whereupon another ask't the rest if they had seen two Discourses lately publisht by two very eminent Members of the College of Physicians, which (says he) the Apothecary's passing by put me in mind of: one besides himself, said he had seen and read them, and added frankly, they seemed in his judg∣ment very judiciously writ, and very much to be con∣sidered by all that regarded their healths; so they left off a little their former discourse, and began to enter into the matter of those Books, and the persons that read them represented to the Company, some of the most im∣portant passages, as their memories served: whilst they were thus discoursing, the Apothecary came down, and was called by the Master of the House to this part of their Conference: To do him right, he spoke very ci∣villy, and told the Gentlemen he hoped all these appear∣ances of difference between the Colledge and them would soon pass over, and presently took leave and went away. After he was gone, one among the rest, a very grave man, who had sat all the while silent and heard what was produc't out of these Books, began very solemnly to declare, that since health was one of the greatest goods of life, and that which alone gives as it were their being so, to all the rest; and since it was so much the interest of a Prince to preserve his people in strength and vigour, he profest he could not understand how that reconcilement of these differences between the Physicians and the Apothecaries, which so much concern
 the lives and healths of the Kings Subjects, could ever be so well made up as the person that was gone said he hoped to see. For, said he, if what has been alledged out of these Books here, be true, there has been too long already a foul and shameful abuse put upon the people, by the present method of practising Physick, as it now (so he phrased it) joggs on between the Physician and Apothecary, and that since those able and well-known Physicians had so freely and honestly of themselves proposed ways of redress, and so far opened the eyes of all men to discern the mockeries they have been gulled with so long, he said it was too late for them now easily to retreat: And believed that all men who had read those Books would as well as he, look upon such a com∣posure, as a new way only of continuing the former abuses under some more artificial and secret disguise. But whatever, said he, may be done out of Conscience, I am sure they shall destroy their interest by it, and as long as ever Apothecaries continue practising as they do, so long shall the most gainful and secure part of pra∣ctice come into their hands, by means of the Bills they formerly have, and daily will receive from them, and nothing remain for the Physician but such sollicitous and extream Cases (where the Apothecary shall vouch∣safe to call him in) in which his own credit shall every moment run as great a fortune as the Patients life. For, said he, how many men in this Town have been al∣ready, or ever shall be intended by the Physicians as Apothecaries only, we in spight of common course they now take to hinder it, shall to save charge and expence of Physick, always esteem and make use of as a sort of cheaper Doctors; except only in such extremities
 where our lives are in manifest danger. And I have often wondred that so great a Company of prudent men should do such things every day, which if we in our particular Trades should suffer, we should not only be laught at, but others of the same way would pre∣sently endeavour to obstruct or punish. For I have often observed my self (to tell truth) when I have been with my Physician either for my own concern or any of my Family, and have received good by what has been prescribed; my Apothecary has often recommended the same, and repeated it again without the knowledg of the Doctor; and at other times told my Wife of an excellent course against the Scurvy, ordered by an emi∣nent Physician, and named him: and sometimes com∣mended a Powder of another Doctors against the Worms, for my Children, which he said he had by him: All which things I noted to be so prejudicial to the Physi∣cian, that I could not choose but wonder that Physicians would so carelesly expose the fruit of all their time and studies, and put every day the best of their Trade out of their own hands into anothers who had so little consi∣deration of them: And this indeed wholly deterred me from breeding one of my Sons a Physician, since I saw how easily every good Medicine that my Doctor had, came into the hands of my Apothecary for a fee or two, and after that, both I and all my Friends could readily command it, and Mr. Doctor never the wiser.
When this Gentleman had done, we began freely to tell one another, being all Tradesmen, who knew as well the difficulty of getting, as the use and consequence of money, how it was customary with us to send to our Apothecaries only, unless where the danger was very
 great, to avoid the charge and expence of Physicians: Not but that we all concluded it would be better to have the advice of a Physician at the very first, if they would so order the matter that we might address our selves as reasonably to them as we now can to our Apo∣thecary; forasmuch as the greatest diseases have small beginnings, and it were more comfortable to apply our selves where we may be as well advised of the nature of our present indisposition and what it is like to come to, as receive what is proper, either to cure or prevent it, which said they, on all hands is confest, the Physician is more able to do than an Apothecary, else should we never fly to him where we fear a danger as now we do. I then took occasion to tell them, that the principal design aimed at in those Books was to exhibit such a method as might lessen the expence of Physick to the people more then half in half, and to shew that the Apothecary by his excessive prices, and by his unnecessary and frequent repetitions of chargeable Medicines, besides sees which some of them take, and expect, or else they think they are not kindly used, amounted often to three times as much as they could hope to have saved in fees by not going to the Physician; and farther added, that a worthy Friend of mine a Physician had an excellent discourse by him to advance this proposition, and enforce what had been already made publick. They commanded me to importune you for it, which since you are pleased so readily to consent to, you have a great deal more ob∣liged all the World in it than me, although I am as much as any can be,
SIR,
