Excellent Creature,
THat I presume to ap∣proach so faire a shrine with so meane an offering, accept not (I pray) my unworthinesse but your owne worthy deservings; borrowing your unspotted name to usher in these nine most incomparable Ladies; neither is it improper, but rather materiall, for modesty and chastitie best accommo∣dates

magnanimity & courage; all ver∣tuall decorements consists not in mas∣culine spirited Viragoes, some of your sex being for their beautie beloved, some again more for their inward ver∣tues, then outward features affected; as virgins for their chast and modest indowments; wives for the love and care they have to preserve their conju∣gall tie untainted, some widdowes for their wisedome, and grave matrons for their gravitie; now in this misse∣lany of your so much magnified sex, where you shall finde one excellently pollisht; it is in your choyse to make her your president; or if any for too much boldnesse branded, you may use her as a vaile to make your owne ver∣tues shew the more conspicuous, for contrarieties in coulers best sets off each others luster; thus after a particu∣lar acknowledgment of my dutie and service, with pardon craved for my too much boldnesse I remaine yours.
