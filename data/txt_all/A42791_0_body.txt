SIRS,
THe Scene of this ensuing Story, was that Coun∣try where Prin∣ces are Mer∣chants, and with which you hold most correspondence; This, with those high respects I have alwaies profess'd to that Noble Society, and the em∣ployment

which by Royall Commission I once had to serve some of them, induc'd me to this addresse.
The Originall was very lately compil'd by an Italian Nobleman, and though it be a small volume, yet it contains as stupendous passages, as e∣ver happen'd on Earth since Discord first entred into the VVorld; And indeed were they not fresh, and acted, as it were but yesterday, it wold stagger any ones faith to be∣leeve, that in so well a policed City as Naples, commanded

by a Viceroy, and three praesi∣diall Castles, so full of Nobi∣lity and Gentry, as no place more, abounding with so many sober and politic Heads, I say, it wold stumble any ones be∣lief, that a young fellow, a pet∣ty poor bare-footed Fisher∣man, shold draw after him in lesse then three days, above for∣ty thousand armed men, and shaking off his linnen slop, blue wastcoat, & red bonnet, shold the fourth day ride trium∣phantly upon his Coursier in cloth of silver, command all Naples, and consequently

neer upon six hundred thou∣sand souls, as absolutely as e∣ver Monark did; and all this by his own single Orders, which were of force enough to plunder or burn any house, to banish the proudest Lord, or chop off any head, without ju∣diciall Proceeding.
In this Narration, though short and small, you may see all the circumstances hereof rela∣ted with much exactnesse: Moreover, as in a little Ring emboss'd with som pre∣cious Stone, one may be∣hold the effigies of a great

Castle, or Mountaine (by a rare contraction of the object) so in this small History of A Ring. Anello, which I pre∣sent unto your eyes, you may discern the greatnesse of my desires, that the world shold witnesse how much I am
