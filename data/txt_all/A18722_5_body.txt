THE world cannot wonder, nor the wise thereof thinke strange, that experience commaunds me to keepe friends, and my pen doth what it maie to purchase me fauour, for that is all the fruites of my studies. Which once taken from me I haue neither prop to vphold mee, nor foundation to stand on: so feaing the weaknes of my feeble build∣ings that lies open to enuies blast) which soddenly may bee blown downe, I seeke manie staies and craue manie supportations for the maintenance of my honest mind, and workes framed for the world to behold. So good sir Henry among the worthy company of my selected friends I honor you with a smal discourse of age & youth, where a little is spoken of the olde Souldiour and the young, not in dispraise of anie of them both, but in the commendation of knowledge, courage, & conduct, vn∣der which three vertues consists many noble actions, & so vnder your fauourable sufferaunce I passe to my pur∣posed matter.
