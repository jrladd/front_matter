GENTLEMEN,
WHEN I Wrote my Book of Fenc∣ing, Entituled The SCOTS Fencing-Master, I designed it should serve both to instruct the Ig∣norant, and be a help to Art∣ists; to instruct the Ignorant by giving them a true and particular Description of the most common Lessons taught in the Fencing Schools, that so by it they might come to understand both better and sooner, the Lessons which their Masters were daily to Descrive and Teach them; And I am very confident I have not failed as to that, for I dare appeal to any who ever took the pains to peruse it, if ever they met with a piece upon the same subject, either so plain, or exact in the Directi∣ons for the Lessons, as it is.
I designed also it should be a help to Artists, in so far as that the looking it over, would bring to their
minds such Lessons, as want of Practice for som time might have worn out of their Memories, and also in respect that there is in it very good directions and Rules for their behaviour in practice against either Artists or Ignorants, both with Blunts and Sharps.
But in that Book I gave only a bare Discriptio of the Rules, without any of the Reasons subjoyne to them upon which they were grounded, which om∣mission did probably make some Artists judge, tha those Rules were not so very infallible, but that as good might be put in their places; And which it is like hath also been the cause of their not having so good an Opinion of, and liking for them, as perhaps otherwise they would.
Therefore, that I might both vindicate the certain∣ty and infallibility of my Rules, by showing that they are not grounded meerly upon my own Fancy, but upon the solid Foundations of Art and Reason, and sa∣tisfie such persons by publishing the Reasons upon which I ground them; As also, make my Rules more com∣pendious, and easier to be kept in their memories, I have in these following sheets made an Abstract of them, and have given the Reasons, why I order such and such a thing in such a Rule.
And although I cannot deny, but a judicious Ar∣tist may perhaps make use of some Rules of his own choise, or making, differing somewhat from mine, which may be very good, and have sometimes as good effect against the particular Play of the Persons he is to en∣gage against as mine could have; Yet I am confident
hey can be no better than mine are, and that if he bserved mine exactly against that same Person, he would find them to have the very same effects with his own, and to be against all humors whatsoever generally the more secure and certain of the two.
But albeit I confess there may be particular Rules invented for particular humors of Play, which may differ from mine, and yet prove very effectual against that particular humor for which they were designed; yet against one of another humor they will be altoge∣ther Ineffectual and prove stark nought, in which doth consist their insufficiency, whereas those which I am to give you will not only prove as effectual against those particular humors, as the particuar Rules designed for them, but will be sufficient also against all humors whatsoever, so that there will be no need of particu∣lar Ones, mine supplying their place because they are general, in which doth lye their Worth and Excel∣lency.
For to discover to you the unsufficiency of particular Rules, consider but what difference there is betwixt a Man's playing with a Person whose humor and me∣thod of playing he knoweth, and with one whom per∣haps he never so much as saw before, certainly there must be Methods taken vastly dissierent to play Ad∣vantagiously against either of those Persons as a Man shall be engaged; for if he be Attaqued by a Per∣son whose Play he knoweth, then knowing upon what Lessons his humor runneth; I confess be may safely make use of particular Contrarys, and Pursuits which
he knows will take effect upon his Adversary, (al∣though undoubtedly to use generalls were a great dale more safe) but if he be Attaqued by one whom per∣haps he never saw, or if he did, yet knoweth not u∣pon what Lessons his humor runneth: I say in such a Case to make use of Particulars were but very bad Judgement.
As for Example, to make a Real and Home Pur∣suite with a single or double Feint, when no such pur∣suite will take effect upon that Person again whom he is playing, but what is accompanied with binding; or to take himself to any particular Parrade, when he is not certain what Lesson his Adversary is to play home upon him; this I say is but to play at Random, and wholly expose himself to Contretemps, by render∣ing his Art altogether Ineffectual.
And this bad Custom of using alwise Particulars, is certainly one of the main Reasons, why the French (who are generally of a Brisk and Hot Constitution) are for the most part when they Engage either both Killed, or at least severly wounded, because immedi∣atly after presenting, they commonly Advance with the particular Pursuite of some single or double Feint, without ever offering to secure their Adversarie's Sword, and their Adversary upon the other Hand, not being accustomed to a general Parrade, and finding he is not certain what particular one he should make use of, endeavours to take time upon him, and so they are both wounded: This is the True French Play, whieh I confess hath a Bonne grace with it at
Blunts, and appears Brisk and Couragious at Sharps; but as to its security, I leave that to be judged of by any considering Person, whither Artist or other.
Therefore the only secure way is to make alwise use of Generalls against whatever Persons you Play, whi∣ther Artists or not, until you have found out their Constitution and Humour, and what particular Les∣sons you judge will take effect upon them, and if you think it fit and convenient then to try Particulars, you may, but I would not advise you to do it sooner if you regard your own safety.
You may now perceive the great Advantage Gene∣ral Rules have of Particular ones, and it is the Ab∣stract of those General Rules that are of such admi∣rable use, which I am to set down to you together with their Reasons in the following sheets, but that there may want nothing to make them com∣pleat and easie to be retained; I have also for your greater ease and satisfaction, (at the end of my Rules and before I give my Reasons) Epitomized this Ab∣stract, and brought it into so narrow a Compass, that a Man must have no memory at all, if he cannot so fix in his Fancy and Brain what I have there given him, as it shall not be in his power when he present∣eth either Fleuret or Sword to get himself ridd of it.
And it is upon that account I call it The SWORD-MAN's Vade Mecum, not that I would have alwise these Sheets carried about with him in his Pocket; (for that any Ignorant can do as well as he, and be ne're a whitt the wiser of them)
but that the Epitome of my Rules which as I said is at the end of them, may be so engraven in his Memo∣ry, that when he is any wayes to Engage, he may through it practice all the rest which are as it were lively represented in that Mirror, which must be al∣wise carried about with him, and still represent those Objects (I mean Directions) upon which his Judge∣ment must work.
Now, as my former Book of Fencing was design∣ed for the use both of Artists and Ignorants, so this Abstract is only for Artists, there being only contained in it the very Marrow and Quintessence of Fencing, which without all debate is not only above the Pra∣ctice of all, but capacity of most part of Ignorants until it be explained to them, and therefore they can have no pretence or claime of Right to it; but if such Persons will be so courious as to take a look of it, its like they may find some things (in my Observations especially) which may be a means to reclaime them, and make them sensible of their Ignorance and folly in contemning and neglecting an Art, by which a Man doth reap so many undenyable Advantages.
And if the reading of this do it not; I assure them I shall not put my self to to the trouble so much as to think of doing it any other way, having lost all hopes that any thing will succed if this once fail; for to deal Ingenously, I am resolved never to put Pen more to Paper upon this Subject, seing I think what I have said first and last upon it, not only abundantly sufficient to Instruct those, whose gentile Inclinations do dispose
hem to take delight in, and follow this Ʋseful Art; but also to convince and perswade all who have the least Drop of generous Blood, of the worth and ex∣cellency of it.
But leaving such Persons to follow their foolish In∣incliations, I do really acknowledge, that it is only to such generous Spirits as you are (to whom I have Addressed these following Sheets) that I so earnestly recomend the closs Practice and Observance of thir sub∣sequent Rules, in the Rejecting or Approbation of which, I shall wholly submit my self to your Impartial Cencure; earnestly Intreating, that if there shall be found any thing in them Repugnant to the first Princi∣ples & true Fundamentals of Art, I may be acquainted with it, that so I may either Vindicate my self, or ac∣knowledge my Fault and Error; in both which I shall most willingly endeavour to satisfie all True Lovers of Art.
And I assure you, were it not that I am Ambiti∣ous, this Art (for which I have such an Estime my self, and of which I think I have given sufficient Te∣stimonies) should be both improven and be hereafter had in more Repute amongst the generality of our Gentry then it hath been hitherto, I had never been either at the Trouble or Charges, to expose my self a second time to the sensure of the Publick, by giving you this (I may call it my Master-piece upon this Sub∣ject) in Print.
I thought to have had the Approbation of most of the Masters prefixed to this Piece; but there being
some things in my Observations (especially anent the Abuses committed in Fencing-Schools to which I refer you) in which we differ, and which they would not go alongst with, I have therefore only condescended to Print the Approbation of one who is of the same Opi∣nion with my self, which I hope will not be thought any Vanity in me, seing I am most sensible the Ap∣plause and Commendation he is pleased to bestow u∣pon me, is far above what I really deserve.
ADIEU.
