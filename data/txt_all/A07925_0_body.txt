THrise Noble Prince, by birth, by blood, by fame,
Renown'd by all, whom all men do adore,
Not so much lou'd for greatnesse of your name,
As for those vertues does your name decore:
Young Haeros, whose haeroick actions sore
Beyond the limits of your yet-spent yeares,
Braue stately minde, wherein this time doth glore,
Whose praises praysing parts, the world admires:
Vnder the shadow of your Eagles wings,
(Since no where else she can for safety flie)
My humble Muse, most royall impe of Kings,
In tragick verse, presents your Princely eye,
With a true story of a Queenes sad case,
Who gaue her life to flee a foule disgrace.
