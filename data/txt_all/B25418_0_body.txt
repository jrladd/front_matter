Unto the Congregations of our Lord Jesus Christ, who upon confession of Faith have been Baptized, and are under imposition of Hands in South Wales, Grace, Mercy, and Peace be multiplyed.

Brethren,
NOtwithstanding the glorious Light that hath broken forth among us in these latter times, yet we see gross darkness covering the face of the Earth; nay, and our Hea∣vens are not so clear as we hope e're long to be∣hold them, for although the Light is come, yet the glory of the Lord is but arising upon us; ours is but the morning of that longed for day, and
 poor Sion is but a looking forth of the Wilder∣ness and from hence it is, there is so many diffe∣rences and divisions amongst us, we speak as we see and according to the Light we have received, and accordingly we are bound by the authority of Divine precept to walk: God gradually dis∣covers himself, and the true Order and Form of his House and Worship unto us, and though we still are labouring under many difficulties, having had much Rubbish to remove (like as the Children of Israel had, when they came out of the seventy years captivity) and many have endeavoured to weaken our hands, yet through infinite grace, we may say the foundation of the House of God is laid: Though some who would build cannot find the Wall, and others strive to bring in a stone of Babylon for a Cor∣ner whilst some others endeavour to cast away a principle Pillar, because it hath lain a long time corrupted and covered amongst the Anti-Christian Rubbish. Reformation is a glorious work, and tis that we all long and breath after Mr. D s. hath been helpful of late to the Church of God in the business of Baptism) but fo want of further Light, lost his way on a sudde by which means I perceive many who are in on respect much behind him, n another are g before him, and may (as far as I can judg get into Canaan as soon as he. Imposition o Hands is the principle of our present controver∣sie, and it is to be lamented, that in such a da as this we should be forced to a work of thi
 nature, our Brother upon this consideration was disswaded from doing that which we see now is published to the world, and rather upon this ac∣count then any other, for few judged it would do the truth it self much injury, by weakning the hearts or hands of such as were established in it, or enquiring after it, nay some were ready to judge it scarce deserved an Answer: But o∣thers considering how well he wrote a little be∣fore upon the other principle, had thoughts it might upon that account the more likely tend to the intangling of the weak, and more unwary Christian. And now as touching my underta∣king in the work as I judged my self every ways uncapable in the respect of others; so it was not my thoughts nor purpose to have been concerned, till I was put upon it by some in this City, and considering the backwardness of o∣thers in the matter, that did the more induce me thereto. And though it be but abruptly done, yet such as it is, I here present to your serious perusal and consideration of all such, whose Souls long after the good, full restora∣tion and perfection of Sion, hoping the God of Truth will make it find entertainment in the hearts of the humble, although I expect it will be slighted by such who are passionately opinio∣nated of their own attainments and perswasions, and who think it below them to receive instructi∣on from such who are inferiour to them. It is the grief of some of your Souls (as I have ground to believe) to see any whom you love,
 and tender in the Lord, setting themselves a∣gainst so holy an Institution of Jesus Christ, but however, this you will find in perusal of this ensuing discourse, though there are too many found amongst Baptized Christians, utterly disalowing and rejecting of it; nay, and seem not desirous to know or enquire after the mind of God herein, yet many godly persons both of the Presbyterian and Independant perswasion (al∣though dark and negligent about the business of Baptism) have breathed, longed, and searched after the knowledge and discovery of this truth, nay and have attained to a good understanding and satisfaction herein, having laboured after a perfect restoration of it, to it's primitive use and purity, refining and draining of it from those corruptions, and mutations of the Popish Church, not only in respect of those abomina∣ble additions, and mixtures of chrism, and other ridiculous ceremonies in it's administration, but also in respect of the subject to whom of right it doth belong, as doth abundantly appear in a Treatise of Mr. Jonathan Hanmores, writ 1658. about which time tis apparent their Spirits were very hot upon it. I find Mr. Caryl (writing E∣pistilary wise in commendation of the said book) speaking thus. I conceive (saith he) the learned Authour of these Elaborate exercitations hath dserved well of the Churches, by clearing the way of those admissions from Scripture grounds, and the concurrent testimony of many, both An∣tient and Modern▪ Writers: As also by disco∣vering
 and removing those Popish additions and pollutions▪ which by several steps have crept into it. And further he says that this ingenious and pious overture holds forth more, then most Churches have hitherto atained.
Also Mr. Vennings honest and judicious ex∣pressions (in his Epistle to the same Treatise) I can't well omit (speaking concerning) reforma∣tion and godliness, saith he, Either by reason of our dim-sightedness, being not able to see afar off, nor penetrate into the depth and bottom of them, or by reason of the abusive traditions, and corrupt glosses, with which for many Ages they have been clouded and over-cast, many truths seem not to be so clear, but they need further clearing, among others such as relate to Church Discipline and order, have for a long time been under debate, and not without some considerable advantage, though I humbly conceive we have not attained so far as to be already perfect, It remains therefore that we press forward, and not be so passionately fond of our prepossest cenceptions, as not to have the patience to consider what may be offered to us, especially by such as are well-wishers to Sion, and desirous to see the Gospel Temple in it's beauty. If any Persons are spirited to search after further knowledge in these affairs, to dig for it as for hid treasures and when they have found a Vein of Golden ore, to refine and stamp it for us, we should be in readiness to receive the truth in the love of it, and pay the
 tribute and homage of obedience for the sake of the God of Truth, whose Image and Superscription it bears.
What great and profitable pains my much ho∣noured friend, the reverend Authour of the ensu∣ing exercitation, hath taken in this one particular, presented to consideration and with what curious∣ness without curiosity, with what learning, with∣out ostentation, &c.—You will best perceive by the view and perusal of it, and though my opi∣nion be of little signification, yet I cannot forbear to say, that as to the substance and main of the design I judge it to be of so considerable an impor∣tance that I do not see how it can be neglected without very great prejudice to Church Commu∣nion, to say no more, haply some may be so nice as to be offended with the name, and dislike Confimation for fear of bishoping, as if that old fashioned garment had but a piece of new named cloath put to i, and drest up in another Mode; if it were so, can no good come out of Nazareth bonus odor veritatis ex requalibet, but if any are under such a fear, I think I may assure them that they are more afraid then hurt, yea afraid, where no fear is, as they will quickly find if they will please to come and see.
I could wish our dissenting Brethren would weigh the matter with more seriousness, and Christian moderation, sith there hath been by so many persons of different perswasions, such a di∣ligent
 scruting made adveritatem inrestigandam, and such holy longings and breathings after the mind of God, herein the result were of having been a singular agreement touching the thing it self. But it may seem strange I must confess to all discerning Christians, that such persons should not be able to discover or find out the Anti-christi∣on polutions and mutations in Baptism, in respect of the subject and manner of Baptizing Which is so apparently contrary to the Gospel rule and pattern also; O that the God of Israel would be pleased to open the eyes of some eminent ones amongst them to see the pure chrystal stream of this Institution of the Lord Jesus, or help them to use Mr. Vennings phrase, to find the Vein of this golden ore, since they will not receive it, as it hath been refined and ready stampt for them by the hands of such, whose skill or faithfulness they seem to suspect.
But first, How alas can they be perfect in Church constitution and order, whilst they miss the mark in so considerable an ordinance as Bap∣tism, taking a stone of Babylon for a foundation, and that for Baptism, which is none, for it hath been so grosly abused, (as a learned Writer once minded in another case) that there is nothing re∣maining of it amongst them save the meer name of the thing.
But Secondly, May it not be admired that Men of such Light and Conscience should only
 please themselves with the theory and notinal part of a practitual Ordinance of Jesus Christ; they see it to be a Gospel Institution, but never could I be informed as yet that they are in the practice thereof, if ye know these things, happy are ye if you do them.
Thirdly, But how contrary to the rule and glorious Doctrine of the Lord Jesus, would they act should they get into the practice thereof, whilst they so grievously err in the administration of Baptism, sith that also doth wholly belong to adult persons as must be acknowledged if the Ho∣ly Scriptures be a perfect and sufficient rule for us to walk by, and doth express whatsoever is ne∣cessary for us to know concerning it as well as in cases of the like nature.
But probably some may object, since most of the Authours that are mentioned in this insuing discourse (for the further evincing of this truth contended for) are corrupt either in Baptism or laying on of hands or both, to what purpose are they produced.
In answer to which I must say, that what we have offered upon the account of Authours and antiquity, has been occasionally done, Mr. Dan∣vers having lead us in that path.
Nay and I might say we are necessitated there∣unto through his means, unless we should leave
 one chief part of his book unanswered, in regard that he utterly denyes the thing it self, viz. Lay∣ing on of hands upon baptized Believers, as such, affirming that there is not the least mention made of any such thing, or practice in the Scrip∣ture, and Secondly in saying that the Antient Fa∣thers and asseters of it, flew mainly unto tradi∣tion, and the usage of the Church in the case. Should an adversary arise, and utterly deny wa∣ter Baptism, (however administred) and say it was never commanded by Jesus Christ, but that it is a meer humane invention, innovation, or a thing devised of Man, yea and affirm that all the Fathers and Confessors, that heretofore did plead for it, wholly made use of tradition, and usage of the Church in vindication thereof.
Would not any that is for Baptism judge it ne∣cessary, not only to prove it was instituted by the Lord Jesus, and practiced by the Apostles and primitive Christians, but also prove in opposition to his apponant, that those Writers both of for∣mer and latter times who contended for it, did fly to the Scripture for the proof and confirmation thereof, though some of them could not do so, as touching the subject and manner of administrati∣on, from hence it is that we have proceeded on such a method in the defence of an Ordinance of the same nature and authority.
And now my dear Brethren I cannot but ac∣quaint you, that my Spirit hath been much re∣feshed to hear how the work of the Lord has
 been carried on of late amongst some of you and the readiness of many to receive this despised tuth, I am perswaded the more a truth is oppo∣sed, the more it gets ground, and the Saints with others inquire after it, for since Mr. Danvers book came forth, at one Meeting in London, on one day upon my own knowledge, near thirty persons came under the practise hereof vincet vritas, let truth go on conquering, and to conquer, the Lord will arise and scatter all the clouds of darkness and opposition, and take away the reproach from his servants, cast upon them for witnessing to his truth, and being zealous for his name, let them be ashamed who transgress without cause, if we are reproached let us take it patiently, sith it is for our pretious Redeemers sake, who hath said you are my friends if you do whatsoever I com∣mand ye, and in another place, whosoever there∣fore shall break one of these least Commandments and teach Men, so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of God.
Brethren remember that the Spirt of God pro∣nounces them worthy of commendation who stand fast and keep the ordinances as they were delive∣red to them, and the more we see evil Men and Seducers labouring on every side of us, to tread under feet, and contemptiously despising of them, let us stir up our selves with one heart in the de∣fence of them, and as they are appointed, as Con∣duit-pipes for the conveyances of the Spirit, and blessings of the Gospel to our Souls, so let us walk as such that experience the inward life and vertue of them, that thereby we may beautifie the Gospel
 and Doctrine of God and our Saviour in all things having Lamps & Oy lalso in our Vessels, the form of sound words; & power of godliness in our hearts and lives. And now finally Brethren that I may not be further tedious unto you, my breathings and desires are, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of lighs, the God of all comfort and consolation would fill you with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding, and grant you more clear and hea∣venly communion with himself, and one with ano∣ther in the paths of peace and righteousness and in able you to walk inoffensively in all well pleasing being fruitful in every good work, and that the God of all grace would establish, strengthen and settle you in his truth and ways, that so you may remain unmoveable like a rock, in these evil and perilous times, wherein so many turn aside; giving ear to seducers, imposters, and lying spirits, with which our days so abound, that it will be a choice blessing to be kept from falling, and preservd with∣out blame till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Now that the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant, would sanctify you throughout, & keep you from falling and present you without spot be∣fore him, in the day of his glorious appearances, shall be the constant and hearty prayer of
