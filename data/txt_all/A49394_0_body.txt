My Dear Friend,
WHom neither thy Pro∣sperity nor my Affli∣ction has ever divided from me, it has ever been your good Fortune (and your Mind has ever been better than your Fortune) from the first Day of our Friendship to stand upon the higher Ground, and to have always been doing Kindnesses, and never needed any. I will confess if you will Pardon me that I have some∣times secretly repin'd at this thy good luck and envied the Ho∣nour

and the Pleasure which this Advantage gave you, and can you blame me since it ex∣cluded me from a share in one of the most ravishing Delights of Friendship? You know what Attempts I have made to re∣deem this Inequality, but all in vain till now: Now I flat∣ter my self that I have found a Present to make you that can∣not provoke your Generosity tho' it were Nicer and more scrupulous than 'tis; I have now at length found a way to End most happily, the only Diffe∣rence that ever has been be∣tween us in an uninterrupted Friendship of near Seventeen years: You shall always be For∣tunate, always able to do Kind∣nesses, and be in need of none;

and I will always strive to vanquish and surmount all the Disadvantages of my Fortune, and in despite of them find some way to express my Affe∣ction, and return your Obli∣gations. And thus if I fall' not short of my Design, I shall be equal with you; for 'tis no small Service I propose to do you, I will now be your Guide, I will Conduct you not as you have done me (tho' for that too I must ever thank you) through barren and impo∣verish't Piccardy, but through all the Ways of Pleasantness, and all the Paths of Peace. I will give you a Sight not of France, but Canaan; I will make you a sharer of that Immortality which I aspir'd to, and bring you to

that Heaven which is the Sacred Abode of Sacred Friendship, and Sacred Joys. What a Dark Cot∣tage, what a Rude Heap will the now-Admir'd Versailles then seem to you! But see whither I have suffer'd this Passion to transport me? how easie is it for one that follows the Con∣duct of Affection to be rather Obliging than Discreet! I had al∣almost forgot how little you stand in need of these kind of Helps, being not only a suffi∣cient Guide to your Self, but a Prudent and Successful one to others in the Way to Happiness: however though you need no Guide, I may serve you as the Companion of your Journey, I may 'wake you in a Morning, I may oblige you to quicken your

pace, and I may Entertain you with Reflexions and Remarks upon the Countrey as we pass, and ever and anon mind you of the Beauty and the Pleasures of that Countrey we Travel to; these and such like Assistances the most Perfect need, these are the Offices of the truest Friend∣ship, and these the Papers I send you, may I hope in some mea∣sure perform. Adieu,
