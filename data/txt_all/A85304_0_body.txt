MY LORD,
I Know well (for I know it by Experience) that your Lordship hath been trained up from a Youth in matters of Embas∣syes, and Legantine Affaires,
as wel when you attended my Lord your Father to Den∣mark, and other States of Germany, as many yeares after in the French Court: Therefore the Dedicatory addresse of this new Peece, will not be adjudged incon∣gruous by any discerning Reader, but very pertinent, considering the quality of the subject, which treats of trans∣actions of that nature, being the Manuall observations of that knowing Knight, and well accomplish'd Courtier, Sir John Finett, vvho officiated so ma∣ny yeares in Affaires of that
kind; Therefore this Peece goes indented vvith many signall Passages of the Recep∣tion, and Treatments, of the Conduct & Audiences, the Pre∣tences, and Precedencies, vvith divers Contests, and Puntili∣oes of State between forren Ambassadors.
Among other parts of In∣dustry vvhich vvere knovvn to be in that Worthy Knight, one vvas, to couch in vvri∣ting, and keep an exact Di∣ary of vvhat things had pas∣sed in his Province as Ma∣ster of the Ceremonies, accord∣ing
to the laudable Custome of the Italians, and trans∣mitted by them to the high and low Dutch Ministers of State, vvith others.
Moreover, these Obser∣vations go interwoven vvith divers Historicall Passages, and those most faithfully re∣lated, there being nothing taken here upon trust, but all upon his own knovvledge, being stil upon the place him∣self, and an Actor in every thing, as appeared by the Manuscript he left: And thus much, out of the conver∣sation
I had often vvith him, I vvas desired to tell the World.
Lastly, Besides the Mo∣tives before mentioned, there vvent another Inducement to this Election, vvhich vvas the high respects, and Honour I professe your Lordship, having discove∣red in you a true Sidneyan Soule, vvhich by a pecu∣liar Noble Genius, is ob∣served to be extraordinari∣ly inclin'd to the Theory, and Speculative part of Vertue, as vvell as to the
Practicall; In vvhich opini∣on I rest,
My most Honoured Lord, 
Holborn this 20. of April, 1656.
