I Hauing (right Worship∣full) receaued by your good means, great courte∣sies both in the country & at my studie in Oxforde, and as not able any way to requite the like, I haue yet and will still keepe the same in a gratefull memo∣rie. In the meane time at a good testimonie hereof I dedicate this Sermon to your Worship, which at your request I preached at your house before the right honorable the most noble Earle of Darby, and the right reuerend father in God the B. of Chester with diuerse Knightes and Esquires of great Woorship at the solemne marriage of your daughter, a modest and vertuous Gentlewoman, maried to a yong Gentleman of great worship and good education. The which holie ma∣riage God blesse euen as he blessed Ioseph,
Gen. 48.20. that it maie be said of their issue as it was said of his children, God make them as Ephraim and Manasse.
For your selfe as you haue long beene a principal pro∣tector of Gods trueth and a great countenance and credit to the Preachers therof in those quarters, and haue hun∣ted out and vnkēneled those slie and subtil foxes the Ie∣suites and seminarie Priests out of their clles & caues,
 the vtrmost of your , with the great ill will of many both open and priuat enemies to the prince and the Church, but your rewarde it with the Lord: and as you haue maintained stil yo house with great hospitality in no point diming the glory of your woorthy predeces∣sors, but rather adding to it: So I pray God stil continue your zeale, your liberality, your loyaltie and fidelitie to your prince, Church and common wealth, that here you may line long with encrease of worship, and after the race of your life welre here you maie be partaker of chose vnspeakeable ioies in the kingdome of Heauen which be prepared for all the elect children of God, vnto whose blessed protection I recommend you and al yours. Amen.
