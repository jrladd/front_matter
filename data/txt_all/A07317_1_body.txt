MADAM,
I Make bolde to present vnto your grace a Looking-glasse, in the which (if it shall please your grace to make vse of it) ye shall see cleerly represented the fortune of the faithfull both heer & hence; to wit, the Grace of Gods Seruants
on Earth, and the Glorie of his elect children in heauen. It will shewe your excellence how excel∣lent a thing it is, for men and women to serue God by fighting against sinne, Sathan, the world and the flesh, and euen to be entred into his seruice in their tender yeeres. It likewise la∣yeth open the greatnes of the rewarde that God hath layed vp for all his sincere and perseue∣ring Seruants. For it pointeth out the right and streighte way that leadeth from the Garden of grace (wherin the flowers of all Christian vertues are to be found) vnto the Gallerie of Glorie: for into this there is none entrie, but by the other; euen as of olde, there was no passage into the Temple of honour but through the Temple of vertue, both builded by the most vertuous and honored Emperour Marcus Marcellus. In a word, it layeth open vnto the eye, such desirable things, as the very signification of your graces owne Christen name may serue to put you in minde of: for ELIZABETH signifieth asmuch as the fulnesse of God; And the fulnesse of God is none other thing ells, but grace and glorie, wherof God is full aboue mea∣sure, but men and women in a measure. To the same purpose may likewise serue the signification of the name of ANNA; which both importeth as∣much as grace or gratious and taking rest, and
is such a name, as I assure my selfe, your grace can neuer forget, as being the name of our most gra∣tious Queene your graces owne deare mother by generation, & likewise of a most vertuous Lady very neare and deare vnto your grace, I meane the Lady ANNE HARINGTON your graces most worthy Gouernesse, and euen your mother by Education. And because that this bookish loo∣king-glasse presenteth vnto the eye by reading, and vnto the eare by hearing, the most excellent obiects that either eye can see, or eare can heare or yet can enter into the heart of man, therefore, haue I made choise of two of the most excellent Princesses, that either eye hath seene, or eare hath heard tell of these many ages past; the one our most gratious Soueraignes most worthy mother, and euē your graces most noble Grandmother Queene MARIE of Scotland, the other the most renouned Godmother of both, Queene ELIZABETH of England, both of them once on Earth ful of gra∣ce, and now in heauen full of glorie: And as I haue in a manner Christened it by the name of the the one, euen of a much-lauded ELIZABETH, so haue I offered it as it were at the shrine of the other, I meane of a matchlesse MARIE. The which thing I haue done of set purpose to doe therby both their names some piece of honour, so much at
lest as lyeth within the small compasse of a meane Schollers ability to performe, as also therby to de∣monstrate and declare vnto all our Britaines, how much I doe dislike and detest the humorous and slanderous disposition of such passionate persones of whatsoeuer qualitie or condition, countrie or reli∣gion, as dare be so bold as by word or writte to dis∣grace and diffame either of them. And vnto both of them I thought it my duty to performe this Chri∣stian duty, but chiefly as being a Scottishman born (though likewise descended from the ancient En∣glish bloode) vnto my dreade Soueraignes most no∣ble mother, and your graces most gratious Grand∣mother, as she who was not onely the Soueraigne Lady of our Scottish people, but also the most wor∣thy mistris of mine owne Good sire, who had the ho∣nour to serue her highnes in France from her lower yeers. Vnto the memory of whose most noble name, I haue not onely vowed this small part of mine En∣glish Essayes, but also a parte of my Latine la∣bours written for the furthering of peace and con∣corde amongs diuided Christianes: towards the which how great a good will I doe beare, may part∣ly appeare by the 7. chapter of this Booke. To passe ouer a defence of her fame which some yeeres agoe being in France I began to be about against the wicked inuectiues of certaine leud libellers and ly∣ers:
wishing with all mine heart that I may see with mine eyes, or rather help with mine hands one day to make a publike bonefire of all such fire∣brand bookes, leaud libels & spitefull pamphlets, as haue beene at any time hertofore published in Eng∣lish, latine or any other language, in poesie or in prose to the vnreasonable and treasonable reuiling & reproching, blaming and diffaming, of the fore∣saide most worthy Princesse the blessed mother of Britaines peace, whose noble name in the despite of all such detractors, shall be euer had of all honest hearted persones in a respectfull remem∣brance. That which resteth. most gracefull Lady, this bookish Looking-glasse, wherin ye shall see nothing but sound diuinity, and religious directions and enducements to primitiue deuotion and pietie, doth offer it selfe vnto your graces viewe, and beggeth your gratious acceptance both for the twofold most excellent matters sake therein hand∣led, euen Grace and Glorie, & for the two most excellent Princesses sake, whose gracious & glo∣rious names in the forefront it doth beare. Re∣garde it therefore with your fauour able visage, & garde it with your princely patronage, so shall it be secured vnder your highnes shadowe, and I encou∣raged to attempt yet more for the honour of your most gracefull Grandmothers name, and likewise
of your graces owne. And so wishing vnto your grace, the best things which can be had on earth, euen Grace with God and man, and after a long and happie life, the best things which can be had in heauen, euen Glorie with God and Angels; I rest,
