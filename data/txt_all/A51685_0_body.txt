SIR,
I Have sent you the Treatise of Morali∣ty which you desire of me with so much importunity. It is divided into two Parts. In the First I have examin'd wherein Vertue doth precisely consist, and laid down the means of acquiring and preserving it: The Second contains the Duties of it. I know not what Censure you will pass on this Book, you, Sir, who are so nice a Judge; for I confess to you that there are many things in it, which I have not explain'd with that exact∣ness which you require of Authors. But I desire you to consider two Things. The First is, that having no clear Idea of the Soul, you understand what I mean, the greatest part of the Terms of Morality can express only its Sensations. The Second is, that Books ought to be proportion'd, as far as it is possible, to the Capacity of the gene∣rality
of Mankind, and that if I had been too nice and scrupulous in explaining the signification of the Terms which I make use of, I should have extremely tir'd the Atten∣tions of my Readers; for People are soon weary of reading a Book that doth not raise agreable Sensations in their Mind. Per∣haps I may think it necessary hereafter to add some Illustrations which may clear those Difficulties which the common Phrase of Speech cannot remove. The success that this Treatise meets with, will determine my Resolution in that Point.
