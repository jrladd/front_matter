THe knowledge of histories and cronicles, ryght worshipfull syr Antonye howe pleasaunte and necessarye it is (although part lye I perceue my selfe and learned men declare the same at large) the common vse and worldlye practise sheweth euidently, and that it is the recorde of oure forefathers lyfes, without readinge and knowledge wherof we walke in darcknes, and liue like children newe come into the world. But histories and Cro∣nicles
 faithfully wrytten set before our face, as presently to loke vpon all ages, all times, all chaunges, all states, and all doinges, euen from the beginninge of the worlde to our owne time, yea, without that we knowe of no world before oure beinge. Much prayse therfore, and great thankes haue they deserued which hath truly trauailed in that sorte of laboure, as dyd that noble clarke Eusebius, and our worship¦full Contry manne master Beade, whose worthye doinges I woulde some wittie learned man would at this time folowe for an exsample. We had in our English tonge a li∣tell short Cronicle notinge manye thinges worthy of memory, whiche boke I haue by my poore laboure sumwhat augmēted, and enlarged with more matter, but oh good Lord nothing to the purpose of my good will, if I had as much know∣ledge
 as I haue desire of furthe∣raunce, and because right worship¦ful syr Antony I know your good minde, toward the a vauncemente of all honest learninge I dedicate this mine endeuor and laboure to youre mastershippe moste hartelie desiringe your fauourable helpe a∣gainste the nexte Printinge of the same, by your owne examinacion, or els by the diligence of some o∣ther, by youre mastershippe to the same assigned. Requiring also and hartelye prayinge my frences and brothers of the occupacyon of prī∣ting to suffer me quietlye to enioye the benefite of these mine owne la∣bours, and to haue the aduantage of myne owne inuencion as I shal gladly suffer euery of thē to enioye the cōmodities of his, & thē we shal brotherlike liue in concorde one by another, this wishinge you good life and longe. I byd you fare wel
At Cantorbury. &c.
