SIR,
FOR this small Piece to crave your countenance, or the making Apolo∣gies on its behalf (which calls indeed for the Posse Comitatus, the whole extent of your Office, to defend its weakness against the attempt of Tongues, which are ex∣pected
fiercely to charge it with conceit and confidence,) is unfaithfully to be∣tray you into the same censure and im∣putation. Give me only leave to sum∣mon You an impartial Witness, not suborn'd by affection, to attest this Truth; That it was not an itch of Ju∣venile years, desirous to be scracht by Popularity; or only an earnest impor∣tunity of Friends, the customary pre∣tence of Scriblers: but direct Commands and friendly threats of the Grand In∣quest, (whose Persons and Judgements save in this, may justly challenge a large esteem and value,) forc'd and ex∣torted a Promise of committing this to publick View. So that I disown to be styl'd the Parent of this hasty birth, let it call Twelve its Father, and be laid at their Door. I can now triumph
in an innocent revenge, when I can justly indite and call every one of them a felo de se, for offering violence to his own Judgement, and committing a Rape and Deflowring that modesty which I account the inviolable duty of my low conceptions, and well becomes the clearest intellectuals and best ac∣complishments, which like the greatest beauty should wear a Vail; for expos'd to Sun and Air to publick appearances to be read by all; they soil their Fea∣tures and Complexion, and gain the name of confident. To escape so black a brand, let me rather confute my Do∣ctrine, perswade You to be a partial Judge, let Your Affections bribe Your Reason; or let Me beg me favour of Your Place and Charge, reprieve Me being found Guilty and Condemnd,
and account this pure Obedience to their Commands, and a faint return to Your high Civilities and Engage∣ments laid upon
Sir,  March 9th. 1667.
