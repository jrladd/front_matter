Most dread Soueraigne,
YOur Maiesty hauing been pleased to grant vn∣to me sole priuiledge for one and thirty yeares by your gracious Letters Patents, to make and worke Iron, other Mettals, and diuers other materials with Sea-cole, and such other fewels: wherein it hath pleased God to blesse my poore inuentions and endeuours, by ef∣fecting those workes which haue beene heretofore worthily attempted by others, though with fruitlesse successe, I held it my duty vpon publication of these inuen∣tions,
 to present the same to your Roy∣all view, humbly beseeching your Maiesty to accept them as a neuer-dy∣ing Memoriall of the late most excellent Prince Henry your sonne; whose desire of the publique good (besides many par∣ticular fauours which he was pleased to vouchsafe vnto me) was the first motiue and Author to encourage me to make tri∣all, and to accomplish these works, which I hope will proue so profitable to your Maiesty, and so enriching to your King∣domes, as you will neuer haue cause to repent your gracious fauour and priui∣ledge herein bestowed vpon me. The Lord of Heauen and Earth blesse and preserue your Maiesty, your most excel∣lent Queene, and hopefull Royall Issue.
