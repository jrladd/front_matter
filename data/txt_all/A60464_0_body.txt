My Lord,
HAving at length finish'd that Discourse of Planting, which about six Months since in the first rude Draught I presented to Your Lordship; I now take the Confi∣dence from the Incouragement I then had from Your Hand, and that unexpected Approba∣tion thereof given me afterward by a worthy and lear∣ned Member of Your Society, to whom, by Your Lord∣ships Order, it was Referr'd, to make it more Publick under the Patronage of so great a Name: I question not but I shall have many Readers, who, respecting more the Manner, then true end of Writing Treatises of this Nature, will Cavil at the barrenness of my Ex∣pression, and Faulting a thing I pretend not to, Con∣demn my Book before they have scarce Examin'd its Contents: But, as that was very little discouragement to me in the Writing, when I sought only to please some few Friends and my Self, so will it be less now, when I can Retort on those who Carp at Me. This Dedication I beseech Your Lordship therefore to ac∣cept of these my Endeavours (which I hope, being pursu'd, will conduce very much to the Publick Ad∣vantage) and that Profession which therewith I make of being, My Lord,
