SIR,
'TIs an approv'd Opinion, There's not so Vnhappy a Creature in the World, as the Man that wants Ambi∣tion; for certainly he lives to very little use that only toyles in the same round, and because he knowes where he is, though in a dirty road, dares not venture on a smoother path for fear of being lost. That I am not the Wretch I Condemn, Your Royal Highness may be sufficiently Convinc't, in that I durst presume to put this Poem under your Patronage. My Motives to it were not Ordinary; for besides my own propen∣sity to take any opportunity of publishing, the Extream De∣votion I owe Your Royal Highness; The mighty Encourage∣ment I receiv'd from your Approbation of it when presented on the Stage, was hint enough to let me know at whose Feet it ought to be laid. Yet whilst I do this, I am sensible the Curious World will expect some Panagerick on those Heroick Virtues which are throughout it so much Admir'd: But as they are a Theam too great for my Vndertaking, so only to en∣deavour at the truth of e'm, must in the distance between my obscurity and their height savour of a flattery, which in your Royal Highnesses esteem I would not be thought guilty of: though in that part of e'm which relates to my self, (viz. Your Favours showr'd on a thing so mean as I am) I know not how to be silent: For you were not only so indulgent to bestow

Your Praises on this, but ev'n (beyond my hopes) to declare in favour of my first Essay of this nature, and add yet the encouragement of your Commands to go forward, when I had the Honour to kiss Your Royal Highnesses hand in token of your permission to make a Dedication to You of the second. I must confess and boast I am very proud of it; and it were enough to make me more, were I not sensible how far I am Vndeserving. Yet when I consider You never give Your Favours precipitately, but that it is a Certain sign of some Desert when You vouchsafe to promote: I who have termi∣nated my best hopes in it, should do wrong to Your Goodness, should I not let the World know my Mind, as well as my Condition is rais'd by it: I am certain none that know Your Royal Highness will disapprove my aspiring to the Ser∣vice of so Great and so Good a Master; One who (as is apparent by all those who have the Honour to be near You, and know you by that Title) never rais'd without Merit, or discountenanc't without Iustice; 'Tis that indeed obliging Severity which has in all men created an awful Love and Respect towards You, since in the firmness of your Resolution the brave and good man is sure of You, whilst the ill-minded and malignant fears you. This I could not pass over, and I hope Your Royal Highness will pardon it, since 'tis unaffe∣ctedly my Zeal to You, who am in nothing so Vnfortunate, as that I have not a better opportunity to let You and the World know how much I am
