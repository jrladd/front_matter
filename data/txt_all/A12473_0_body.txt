Right Honourable:
AS there is no∣thing which doth more beautifie and adorne this great admi∣rable frame of Heauen and Earth, then the wonderfull variety of those rari∣ties, created in and about the same,

in so many subiiects of diuers kinds of things, whereof they sub∣sist. So amongst those varieties, nothing is so wonderfull as the se∣uerall gifts proceeding from that. All-quickening Spirit of God: which as at first, It moued vpon the waters, cherishing, vpholding, and quickning that rude, vndige∣sted great formelesse lumpe, vntill by Diuine power, it had anima∣ted that, and all things therein contained, setting them in their most beautifull formes; breathing, as naturall life in man, so, at length a more abounding spirituall life, which should vent and diffuse it selfe in so many thousand seuerall gifts and excellencies, as (in a ma∣ner) there are seuerall Christians: especially in the Ministers of the

Word: whose lippes, as they pre∣serue knowledge, so haue they their seuerall abilities, some to cast downe, raise vp, intreat, perswade, conuince, instruct, threaten, insinu∣ate, reforme, illustrate, explaine, o∣pen, divide, and conueigh truthes to the seuerall capacities of their hearers. In which the Author of this Booke (a man well known to your Honours) being so excel∣lently sometime adorned with a compound of these and many moe gifts, (in most whereof hee excelled) that the memory of so pious, painfull, and learned a man of God might not be forgotten, I aduentured to shrowd this booke vnder your Honours wings of protection, to receiue some lustre and countenance by your fauour,

clearing the obscurity thereof, in place of the curious hand of the most worthy Author now dead: who as he was, and his Name and Fame (I hope) yet is and euer will be precious in your sight; So I hope the Relation hee sometime had with some of yours, and esti∣mation from you, would purchase me easily a pardon for this intru∣ding boldnesse, whereby I haue as∣sayed to declare my selfe euer,
