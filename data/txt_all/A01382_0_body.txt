THE generall report (right Worshipfull) of your gallant minde and noble dispo∣sition, hath imboldned me to pres this my worthlesse labour to the view of your ingenious iudgement: and the long desiers of my willing minde being now set on fier with the fame of your bright renowne, presageth my mses good fortune; which although it be but barren, yet wate∣red with the deaw of your gratious acceptance, will here∣after be more fruitfull. What the Storie is, let your wise∣dome conceite: my Subiect is, The Vertues of a chast Queene, and the loyaltie of a faythfull Subiect; the triumphes of an honorable minde, shrowded vnder the habite of a ielous King. Accept it (sweete M¦tialist) with a fauourable countenance, and my hopes are aduanced. After the thundering alarums of dreadfull Warre, Souldiers will sometime recreate themselues with pleasant discourses: be you then, I beseech you (right Wor∣shipfull) a kind Patron to an vnworthy witt, that I may say vnto my muse, Happy is thy chaunce, and fortunate thy proceedinges.
