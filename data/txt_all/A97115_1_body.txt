SIR,
I Was ever very unwilling with the Scriblers of this Age, to do open pe∣nance in a white Sheet; yet the Great Tyes, and manifold Obligations, which you have upon me, have inforced me to lay aside my natural Modesty, (for I would ra∣ther seem somewhat Arrogant than altoge∣ther Ingratefull) and to present to your view this ensuing Discourse; it had not the Happinesse to take your Judicious Ear, by reason of your absence from home when it was preached, and now it craves your fa∣vourable Eye, though perhaps it might bet∣ter
 have expired and vanished with the breath in which it was delivered: But al∣though the meanesse of it may not so well please your accurate Judgement, the Loyalty of it will I know well please your Loyal Heart.
The Sermon was Calculated at first for the Meridian of a Country Auditorie, but with your Patronage it may serve indifferent∣ly for any other place within this Nation.
God himself accepted their good Will who brought onlie a Little Goats hair to∣wards the Building of the Temple, as well as their richer Offerings, who being blessed with Greater Abilities than Others, brought in their Gold and Silver; and so I hope that you Sir will accept this Slender Offering, since it is also designed for the edifying of the Church of God.
Please you to peruse it, you shall meet in this Discourse, with a True Character of our Most gracious Soveraign, though I confesse it be drawn with but rude lines, and in weak Water-Colours.
As also here you may likewise at once
 take Prospect of that Happiness, for which, both like Josuah and Moses, you have so gal∣lantly fought, and so fervently prayed: and of that Misery, which you, and all Loyal Subjects have at length escaped, by the mira∣culous Return of his Gracious Majestie to his Throne, whom I know you truly Love and honour.
Sir, if this slight Paper-work of mine, may any way be servicale to my God, my King, my Country, or my Friends, or may by Gos blessing reduce any Dislyal Soul to his lost Allegance, and make him a better Subject hereafter, by shewing to himself his own ugly Metamorphosis, he hath his whole Wsh, Intent, and Design, who here subscribes himself, Sir
