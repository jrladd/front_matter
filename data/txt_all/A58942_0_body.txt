Reverend and Learned SIRS.
I May justly expect that by your Approbation or Censure the
Reputation of these Scriptural Mapps must stand or
fall: And therefore, being by my own Examinations of
them prompted to hope well from You, I offer them to your
perusals.

The Originals of these had their Original from an Assembly
of Dutch Ministers, who selected from among themselves two
such Persons as they thought apt and able to correct all the
foregoing Authours that have set forth Mapps of the like na∣ture:
viz. Ortelius, Christiaen Adrichom, Arnold and
Nicholas Geilkerck, &c. which being finisht they exposed
to Publick view: designing thereby the more profitable and
pleasant reading of the Holy Scriptures. Among other Specu∣lators
their Work fell under my Ey: but it was all in the Dutch
Tongue, and scarce to be understood but by those that understood
it: Wherefore I judging it as profitable and pleasant for us
as them, took both the task of Translation upon my self, and the
Charge of Engraving and Printing the Plates and Book.

If therefore by your good Readings any of you find faults
in any of these Mapps, and let me know where they be, I shall be
both thank fal to you, and carefull to get the Plates corrected
and amended against the next Impression.
Reverend and Learned Sirs,
I wish this Peece as ca∣pable
as I am willing to serve ye.
