The bale begonne, is when deformed warres,
Whith civil stroake, embrewes his natiue swoorde.
For were it not, that rage of rancours roote,
By growinge evills, had watcht so blacke a tyme,
I weane envie, by suche owtraginge splene
Had not brought foorth, this fowle mishapen chan∣ge
In maymed state, that RONSARD wayles in ryme,
And I reduce, whith not resemblinge penne,
To Englishe grace (though in vnskilful verse)
By frendes enforst to publish now abroade:
Whiche I present (SIR) to yowr shrowdinge hande,
No Trophee, nor masse of mighty myne,
Nor golden somme, but as à miete of fame,
Where power failes t'vnlade affections force.
