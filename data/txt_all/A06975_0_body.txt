RVMOR that Hydra headed Monster, with more tongues then eyes, by help of his intelli∣gencer enuy hath made strange miscon∣structions on this dumbe Knight, which then could not answere for himselfe: but now this publication doth vnty his tongue, to answer the obiections of all sharp critticall censures which heretofore haue vndeseruedly past vp∣on him. And for my part (I protest) the wrongs I haue receiued by some (whose worths I will not traduce) with a milde neglect I haue laught at their follies; for I thinke my selfe happy, because I haue beene enuyde, since the best now in grace haue beene sub∣iect to some slanderous tongues that want worth themselues, and thinke it great praise to them to detract praise from other that deserue it; yet hauing a partner in the wrong, whose worth hath beene of∣ten approued, I count the wrong but halfe a wrong, because hee knowes best how to answer for himselfe: But I now in his absence, make this Apologie, both for him and me. Thus leauing you and the booke together, I euer rest yours.
