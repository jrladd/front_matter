My LORD,
WEre you not so great a Lover of Gardens and Gardening, as you are, yet such are my obligations to You, that I

could not, without extream in∣justice, grant a dispensation to my self, should I not dedicate this work unto you. 'Tis unto you I owe all that I am, and that honest leisure which hath given me the means of informing my self in the knowledge of order∣ing Trees. I should be truly in∣grateful, if, upon this occasion, I gave you no mark of my Re∣spects and Acknowledgements. Be pleased then, My Lord, to receive this Book as a Homage which I owe unto you; the payment whereof gives me ve∣ry great contentment. If at a∣ny time your Great and Noble Employments permit you to give your self the Recreation

of your Orchards, you will find nothing there, I confess, which is new to you; yet there you will see, at least, some shadow of this pleasant Art, the secrets whereof you are so perfectly ac∣quainted with: You know how many Charms this lovely part of Agriculture hath, that it af∣fords us Joyes, which are altogether pure, and Hopes as sweet as innocent. I have my self been taken with them from my tender years; but when I consider, that this Love hath found a place in your Heart, and that the same Hand, which so worthily holds the Ballance of Justice, disdaines not some∣times to cultivate Trees, so no∣ble

an Example redoubles my passion. The glory of imita∣ting you is a new spur unto me, and binds me more strongly to this dear entertainment of my dayes: Indeed, my Lord, if one consider the wonders of your Life, he that sees those emi∣nent Qualities, which render you admirable unto all France, that invincible Fidelity to the service of your King, that high Prudence, which in the midst of so many Tempests, knew how to preserve a Calm in our Province, will doubtlesse have wherewithall to flatter himself, when he finds that he followes in the paths of so excellent a Person; that he loves at least

what so Great a Man hath an af∣fection for, and that he hath some inclinations common with him: I know, my Lord, that I take up too much of your time, thus to entertain you with our rustick Divertisements: But expect not, that a Gardi∣ner should entertain you with any other discourse, than that of his owne Art, I leave the whole Field of your Prayses to be tilled by those great Spirits, whereof our Age is so fruitfull: Posterity will read in their works all that which our eyes have seen; And, like us, will wonder how one single person, in such difficult Conjunctures,

could manage so many Spirits, and dis-entangle so many and so different Interests. As for me, I can discourse of nothing but our Wall-trees, and those benefits which I have received from your hand: Assuredly, when I think upon your Good∣nesses, and all those Favours which you have so liberally heaped upon me: I ought, me∣thinks, to have nothing in my mouth but Thanks, and no∣thing but thoughts of Grati∣tude in my heart: This, my Lord, is my thought, and this is what I am able to do to acquit my self towards you: This is that which this Book shall pub∣lish

in every place where it shall have the fortune to arrive: It is an Infant, which now I dare to present unto you; hither∣to it appeared not without trembling, and shewed it self in publick, onely to try whe∣ther the World would judge it worthy of you; now, that it hath found amongst good men more approbation than it could hope for, I present it unto You wholly, and without reservation: Suffer it, My Lord, to call it self Yours, that under so powerfull a prote∣ction it may pass through all those Climates where our French Muses are known to

instruct or recreate all those that love Gardens and Garde∣ning.
I am, in all sorts of Respect (MY LORD)
