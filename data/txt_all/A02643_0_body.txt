SIR:
THe Hunting of harmefull beasts is commended for recreation, and the Meta∣phoricall hunting of wic∣kednesse is commanded for reformation. It was part of my recreation (being som∣times wearied with the study of the Law) to vn∣kennell, to put vp and hunt the Fox, for so S. Bernard

calls the Flatterer; which may bee called, My spare∣houre-meditations: I know your VVorship to bee free from this vice, which made mee bold to flye to your Worship to shelter it vnder the wings of your Protecti∣on, hoping for no excepti∣on but your acceptation; wishing you with your vertuous Lady, all health and happines in this world, and all blessednesse in the world to come: Thus prayeth
