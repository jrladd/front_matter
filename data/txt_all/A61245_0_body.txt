SIR,
IN meer Compliance with your Earnest Desires I have adventur'd to Print this plain Sermon. For tho' I am sufficiently assur'd, that no good Man can except against the Substance of the Discourse, or the bonesty of its Design (which is to promote Christian Charity, and Christian Loyalty:) Yet I am so sen∣sible of its Defects upon many other Accounts, that no∣thing but the irresistible Power of your Friendship could have over-rul'd and determin'd my will to this Publica∣tion. I know, Sir, your Over-value for the whole Com∣posure proceeded from the perfect suitableness of its Matter to your Principles and Practices, which are, and alwayes have been Eminently Loyal, even in the worst of Times, when the Faction was bold and daring and formidable, and all the several Sects of Religion
 were united witb the Men of no Religion in one joynt accursed Conspiracy against the Government: When it was accounted a Crime to be a good Subject, and all the Loyal men, by as gross and foolish a Solaecism, as a furious and undistinguishing Malice could be guilty of, were Branded with the odious Names of Tories, Arbi∣trary Men, Popishly affected, and whatsoever might expose them to a popular scorn and hatred. But neither their false Pretences, nor false Reasonings, nor false Characters could Corrupt your Judgement, nor shake your Constancy, but you continued firm and immoveable in your Duty, and upon all just Occasions Bore up against the Rudeness and Insolencies of the Faction, with a Cou∣rage and Resolution which became you. And this deser∣vedly got you so Considerable an Interest in the Esteem of his late Majesty of blessed Memory, that He judg'd the Power of so large a County, as this of York, could not be intrusted, at so dangerous a Juncture, in safer hands than your own. And the faithful Discharge and vigorous Ex∣ecution of your Trust has procur'd you (no doubt) a propor∣tionable Value with His present Majesty. And that His Majesty may never want a sufficient number of such Loy∣al Subjects, and that others may learn to become and continue such, by your excellent Example is the hearty and unfaign'd Prayer of
Sir,
