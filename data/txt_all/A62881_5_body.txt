My Lord,
'TIS properly the Business of a Poet, to Celebrate the most exemplary Characters of the Age and Coun∣try in which he lives.

This was my Design in Collecting these Essays into a Volume, having found them not disapprov'd when singly Publish'd.
But having hitherto treated the Rea∣der with Funeral Entertainments, it seem'd reasonable for me to annex the following List of Worthies, most of whom are living; and long may They yet Live, as it ought to be wish'd of all publick Blessings.
Wherefore there needs no Excuse for Presenting Your Lordship with this Poem; the Esteem You have for the Persons concern'd in it, and their just Respect for Your Lordship make it my Duty.
I will crave leave to add that it was likewise my Ambition and Inclination.

My Lord,
'Tis no Wonder that Your Lordship should be Address'd by Poets since the Thanks of all EUROPE are due to Your Extraordinary Services, which were only to be Accomplish'd by unweary'd Diligence and utmost Prudence in Ma∣nagement.
You have oblig'd Mankind by Your early and continu'd Fidelity to the Best of PRINCES, and Adventur'd the most eminent Dangers for the Preservation of his most Sacred Life.
You have been eminently Instrumen∣tal in a Ʋniversal Peace, promoting the Safety and Tranquility of Nations, and done Honour to Ours, by Supporting its Dignity and Grandieur in a glorious Em∣bassie.

These and Other noble Instances will Emblazon Your Character, and Signalize Your Name in History, far beyond what∣ever can be said, by
My Lord,
