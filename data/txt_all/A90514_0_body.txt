Loving Father,
TO write or dictate many words to you, it will be counted but superfluity. But yet least I should be guilty of Astorgy, want of affection to you my Parents; I entreat you (good Sir) to accept of these few lines in a Sermon of mor∣tality, as a true sign and symptome of my thankful∣ness to you for my education, and my preservation (under God) in my sickness. Your extream charges and love I acknowledge, and for this I shall pray that you may return to Heaven in a full age (not yet I hope) And rest
