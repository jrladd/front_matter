MAtter of noueltie or admiration, hath euermore no greater enemie, then ouer-rash and preiudicate oppinion: things likewise (of neuer so much credit) in other countries, beeing not bred or borne in our owne, doo surmount all com∣passe of beleefe. Wherefore Gentlemen, this won∣der, happening in the declining state of the world, and in Fraunce, no fatte region from outs of Eng∣land: if the brackish deuider of our Continents, make it not vnrellish-able in your tastes, the quea∣ie stomacks of others I shall the lesse care for. You are men of a misterious profession, exceeding good Anatomists, and skilfull searchers into our bodies whole faculties. The Authour of this labour in French, as (by reading) I am sure your selues will say no lesse, is both an excellent Philosopher, Phi∣ian, Chirurgian, and a skilfull Anatomiste, and of

all these hath made good witnesse in this discourse▪ I could not be-thinke me, to bestowe my paines any where more desertfullie, then on such as are answerable to the first Authours qualitie: which neither I would not ouer-boldly presume to doo, ill (by a kinde examen) of some of your selues, the worke was thought worthie your entertayning. It hath cost me good paines, and therefore may me∣rit the kinder acceptaunce: which if it do finde at your hands, as I would be orie but it should, I re∣maine yours in any more serious imployment.
