May it please Your Lordship,
HAving undertaken to collect a
short Account of the Roman
Affairs, I here presume to
present it to Your Lordship; and were
the Performance in any degree answer∣able

to the Nobleness of the Subject,
and the Greatness of Your Lordship's
Skill in this, as well as in all the po∣liter
Parts of Learning, I might justly
hope to find it in some measure
acceptable. But how mean soever
the Performance is, I have still some
fair Prospect of the Design; and I was
almost assur'd, from Your Lordship's
generous Inclinations, to promote the
best and most useful Parts of Learning,
that such a Design, cou'd not, by any
other Means, be so acceptable to the
Publick, as by having the Advantage
of Your Lordship's Name before it.
My Lord, I cannot pretend to any
such Knowledge of the Law, as to
understand which is the surest Method
of attaining to Perfection in it. But,
as I am inform'd, some lay their
Foundation in the ancient Histories

of the Saxons, Danes, and Normans:
Others, I am told, only by the
Way of Institutes, Reports, and Sta∣tutes,
arrive to a considerable Fame
and Practice. But some there are,
whose generous Industry carries 'em
yet further, who think it necessary to
spend some time in the Roman History,
Classical Authors, Civil Law, and the
Pleadings of Cicero. And, I need not
go about to acquaint the World,
That Your Lordship's Excellency
in all these, together with Your
great natural Endowments, and an∣swerable
Improvements, did not only
give Your Lordship very high Advan∣tages
over Others, at Your first Appear∣ance,
but in a very short time rais'd
You to the highest Dignity in the Law,
and the utmost Favour of the greatest
Prince in the World.

I speak not this, my Lord, so
much to celebrate the singular Pru∣dence
and Justice of His Majesty, in
advancing Your Lordship to this most
honourable Station, as to shew the
World what peculiar Reason I had to
offer this humble Address, and how
ambitious I was of appearing,
My Lord,
