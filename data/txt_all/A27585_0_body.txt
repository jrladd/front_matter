I Have heretofore Represented to you the Majesty, and Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, that shall Seven Times hence after the Expiration of the Apostasie (now Ecclipsing it) be Daily more, and more Visible; Till it shine out in perfect Glory. This I have done according to the Sure Word of Prophecy, which is of no private Interpretation, but being Scripture, must be search'd even as All other Scripture, and so be, as All other Scripture, Pro∣fitable; and it hath this Excellency above other Scripture; That It particularly shines, as a Light in a Dark place, viz. In this Time of Eclipse, or, as the Pole-Star in the Night, that we may know, whereabout we are in Time, and State.
Yet because the General Prepossession of Men, Caring for none of these Things, would not have Prophetic Scripture Search'd; that I might make Acceptable this Great Truth every way; I have now Represented it, as It is Carv'd, and Wreath'd into the whole Analogy of Faith, the Great Articles, and Principles of the Do∣ctrine of Christ, according to the most Instructive Scriptures, viz. the Redemption, the Resurrection, the Eternal Judgment, the Saints not Dying, but Chang'd, the Delivery up of the Kingdom to God All in All; which cannot be without the Kingdom of Christ Explain'd at full Dimensions.
Now I call the Following Treaty hereof, a Catechism, as an Inti∣mation of the Plain manner of Handling for the benefit of All; and of the necessity of Consideration, and Repeated Application of our Minds to it; and also to shew; The Kingdom of Christ, though it yet lye Hid in its Roots the Fore-nam'd Articles, is still a Fundamental Truth; and so though Catechism may seem below your Orb, yet This of the Kingdom of Christ, even as All Catecheticall Truths, deserves the Gravest and most Awful Judgments to Try and Recom∣mend Them.
I do Acknowledge my self the unworthiest of the Servants of Christ, in the most Abased Circumstances; and lay my self at the Feet of the Church of Christ with most Penitential Confessions and Ac∣knowledgments; Yet I must be Bold in our God to
 say, He hath been pleased to Reveal to me, of an Infant Understan∣ding in Compare; and the Chief of Sinners; what He hath not so fully Reveal'd to the more Holy and Prudent; Even so Father, For so It seemed Good in thy sight.
I most Humbly therefore Beseech, and do even Adjure you by the Coming of our Lord Jesus, and by our Gathering together to Him in the General Assembly of his Kingdom, That You would either shew by Scripture; These Things cannot be so; or Re∣ceive this Ministery, as the Oracles of God, and Testify your Re∣gard to it, that now makes in your Ears the cry of the Bridegrooms Coming in his Kingdom, That none of us may be among the Slum∣bring, though Wise Virgins, much less among the Foolish.
And You, to whom This Address will first Come, ought to be the more Watchful, because the Worldly Splendor of Your Sphere not so well Agrees with the present Ecclipse of Christian Glory, with the Tri∣bulation and Patience of the Kingdom of Christ; and that Sack∣cloth, and Fasting state for the Bride-grooms Absence; You should then surmount that Disagreement by more Eminent Services to this King∣dom, least There should seem Any Surrogation in the Reformation to the Feet of Clay; the Papacy, the Cardinalism, the Roman Hic∣rarchy; who as the most Diametral opposites to the Kingdom of Christ Receive the First Stroke of the Stone Cut out of the Moun∣tains without Hands; and so You Receive the Dishonour of any part in their Fall, at least of Lukewarmness for that Glory of Christ; Or least, as They by a False Glory, as if 'twere the Glory of Christ, Glittering in this worldly Glory, Rob the True Light, and are Effaced by that True Light Appearing, or its Epiphany, You should at all share in that Effacement.
That we may be therefore All Guided by the Father of Lights, with whom is no Variation, nor Shaddow of Turning, to Try the Spirit of this Doctrine; and not to Call the Light of it Dark∣ness; but to Come perfectly out of the present Ecclips; to Go on to Perfection in the Doctrine of Christ is, and shall be the most zealous Prayer of
