IN a former litle booke, (most no∣ble Prince) speaking Ebrew and Latin, I shewed the Persons of Davids Familie: the Kinges race, and the Kinglier then the Kings, the house of our Lord after the flesh: a matter opened in few wordes: yet mistaken in Eng∣land and almost every where, to the ruine of infinite millions: who finding Christians vna∣ble to settle their owne narration, reiected all Christianitie. That small worke I dispersed in many thousand copies by Sea and Lande over Europe and Asia: where many haue thought the gift not meane. Next, knowledge of the Persones that sprang from Davids house: the qualitie of the Kingdome & perpetual Throne promised to David, 2. Sam. 7. and 1. Chron. 17. and Psal. 89. should be knowen. To manifest

that Salomon Davids sonne, and a King that hath all Royalties of this world, is chosen of God. He telleth vpon his owne longue studie and experience, that all thinges vnder the Sunne be vaine: So that the Throne promised to Da∣vid, must be for the world to come: which the man Gabriel that appeared to Daniel to tell our Lords death: and to Marie for his birth, doeth plainly expound what nature it hath: that it is the Kingdome of Christ by suffrings bringing ioye. The whole booke of Salomon herein spent, with helpes to clearnes, I ioyne to the former: which, if God will, shalbe accompa∣nied with others, as the argument calleth for explication.
