I Could have given more, and more easie and common Observations; but these
times call for Di courses that work higher, and more quaintly; I say not this to
force any reputation upon the notions.
This Covenant is the most glorious rise of a Reformation in any age;
mighty and powerfull are the Principles of it; and though this season of our
Solemnity be cloudie, and our evening bloodie, yet it is our Saviours Interpreâˆ£tation;
When it is evening, you say it will be fair weather, for the skie is red.
