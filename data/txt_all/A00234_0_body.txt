GEntlemen, whereas the
old world admired Ha∣nibal
for but scaling the
Alpes, Caesar for build∣ing
a bridg ouer Rheyne,
Pompey for subduing a
few barbarous Territo∣ries,
leaue now to mar∣uaile
at the strategems, the world affordes you
greater maruailes. Looke on the experienced
prowesse of your owne Countreymen,
farre exceeding the puissance of base Pa∣gans,
who as they bee presidents most ho∣norable:
so are they by your steps, and plau∣dities
to be honoured. Imitate the vertues of
your Ancestours, that all the world may ring
of your noble acts, of your Ancestours said I,
nay of our Caualiers yet liuing, who as they
be equall in valour to the best of any time; so
are they before al other to be followed of your
persons at this time. Remember the fortitude

of Norris neuer quailed, consider the magnani∣mitie
of Williams neuer daunted, and worthie
Yorkes forwardnes neuer impeached: But
what should I compile a catalogue of them,
whose valours and vertues are best knowne
vnto you: onely this our Soueraigne, and the
whole commonwealth intreates you, that as
whilom your politique Predecessours, & now
these your martiall Progenitours by their ex∣ploytes
haue attayned the heigth of renowne
in the world; so yee like renowned Children
of so renowned Parents, would by your
couragious enterprises brandish your
names and fames throughout
the world: facite, &
valete.
