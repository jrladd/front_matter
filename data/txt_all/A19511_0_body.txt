MOST Gracious & Dread Soveraigne, vnworthy (I know) are these my endea∣vours, either to bee shrow∣ded from the prejudice of contempt, vnder your Roy∣all Majesties protection, (a Prince of so great magnanimitie and iudgement) or offered vn∣to your learned view; yet your continuall bountifulnes and dayly favours towardes good learning (especially ifit savour of divi∣nity) as it doth exceed your Roialty or great∣nesse, so will it also (I trust) excuse my boldnes in this my humble entreating your gracious

Patronage of this my first & vnlearned Tre∣atise, the which being rawly comprised in a few scattered leaues, and as rudely composed in a sort of scribled & vnlettered lines, the out ward haske whereof, although it be farre vn∣like the lordly gift that Aconitanus offered vn∣to Alphonsus king of Aragon, being vnpolished, may seeme vnpleasant, yet (no doubt) the in∣ward kernell once tasted, and well digested, may proue cordiall, and right fruitfull. And although I cannot with ramping Lyons run in with mightie prayes; yet with the little Ant by hawling in my wheaten graine, I am ready prest to signifie the force of my loue, & loyal∣ty towards your most excellent Maiestie. And thus in al humility, I beseech your High∣nesse to accept this mite of my poore la∣bours: so shall I (if God spare me life) be cō∣forted & encouraged, vnder so mightie a fa∣vourer, to proceed in the like studies; and ac∣cording to my boundē dutie, incessantly with all humilitie pray vnto almightie God (by whom both Kings and Princes raigne) to his glory not onely to preserue your Grace, in

Royall throne of Monarchie vpon earth, but also to be farre more adorned, to raigne with a celestiall crowne of glorie in the kingdome ofheauen.
