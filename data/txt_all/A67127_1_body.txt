May it please your Majesty,
I Need no other Motive to dedicate this Dis∣course, which followeth, unto your Maje∣sty, then the very Subject it self, so pro∣perly pertaining to your Soveraign Good∣ness: For thereby you are Pater Patriae. And it is none of the least Attributes wherewith God hath blessed both Your Royal Person, and Your People, that You are so. On the other side: for mine own underta∣king thereof, I had need say more. I am old and child∣less; and though I were a Father of many, I could leave them nothing, either in Fortune, or in Example. But having long since put forth a slight Pamphlet about the Elements of ARCHITECTURE, which yet hath been entertained with some pardon among my Friends, I was encouraged even at this age, to assay how I could build a Man: For there is a Moral, as well as a Natu∣raler Artificial Compilement, and of beer Materi∣als:

Which truly I have cemented together rather in t plain Tuscan (as our VITRUVIUS termeth  then in the Corinthian form. Howsoever, if Yo Majesty be graciously pleased to approve any part of it, who are so excellent a Iudge in all kind of Structure, I shall much glory in mine own Endeavour. If otherwise, I will be one of the first my self, that shall pull it in pieces, and condemn it to Rubbage and Ruine. And so wishing Your Majesty (as to the Best of Kings) a longer Life then any of the soundest Works of Nature or Art, I ov rest
Your Majesties
Most devoted poor Subject, and Servant,
H. WOTTON.
