RAre Phoenix, which your life do sacrifice,
In vertues flame, to finde a life diuine:
Rich treasurer, of heauens best treasuries,
In whom worth wisdome honor vertues shine.
Sdaine not, these art lesse humble ines to view,
With honors eyes let vertues plaints be scan'd,
That she whose vertues doubled are in you,
By you may scape from Lybitinas hand.
Hir dying fame, by you may be preserued,
Whiles time, and men, and memory endure:
Your liuing name by hirs mought be reserued,
Did not these lines, too much hir worth obscure.
These lines, wherein, if ought be free from blame,
Your noble Genius taught my Pen the same.
