Illustrious Infant:
GIve mee leave to ac∣knowledge
my selfe
thy Servant, ere thou
knowst thy Selfe my
Prince: My Zeale
burnes mee, and my desires are im∣patient:

My breeding Muse longs
for greene fruit, and cannot stay thy
ripenesse: Sweet Babe; The loyalty
of my Service makes bold to conse∣crate
these early Leaves to thy sa∣cred
Infancie, not knowing how to
glorifie themselues, more, then by
the Patronage of such Princely In∣nocencie.
Modell of Sweetnesse,
Let thy busie Fingers entertaine this
slender Present, and let thy harme∣lesse
Smiles crowne it: When thy
Infancie hath crackt the Shell, let thy
Childhood tast the Kernell; In the
meane while, let thy little hands and
Eyes peruse it: Lugge it in thy ten∣der
Armes, and lay thy burthen at
thy Royall Parents feet; for whose
sake, it may gaine some honor from
their glorious Eyes. Heaven blesse
thy Youth with Grace, and crowne

thy Age with Glorie: Angells con∣duct
thee from the Cradle, to the
Crowne: Let the English Rose, and
the French Lilly florish in thy loue∣ly
Cheeke: And let their united Co∣lours
presage an euerlasting League.
Let the eminent Qualities of both
thy renowned Grand-fathers meet
in thy Princely Heart; that thou
mayst, in Peace, be honourable; and
in Warre, victorious. And let the
great addition of thy Royall Parents
Vertues make thee vp a most incom∣parable
Prince, the firme Pillar of
our happines, and the future Object
of the Worlds wonder
Expected, and prayd for by
