In which case I think it my dutie not to forbear the making of it publick for the Truths sake, as in the difference between Peter and Paul Galat. 2.5. And then secondly, if I did come up to the As∣sembly to inquire into the Truth of the Propositions, I should but lose my labour; so that there remains but this on∣ly way for me to discover the Truth, that it be made publick for all to judge, and see how weightie and necessarie a thing it is these things should be re-debated and considered of in love, the things questioned being the substantials not of go∣vernment onely, but worship also. Thus praying God to di∣rect You to do what is according to his will, and discover to you your failings therein, I rest,
