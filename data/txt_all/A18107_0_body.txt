Most gracious Souereigne,
THat which I haue here in a few dayes writ∣ten for the Defence of my Father, I ac∣knowledge to aue proceeded from your Maiesty, as the first Author of it; who beeing so highly offended at the iniury which Casaubon's name

receiued, that by your Royall au∣thoritie the deceitfull plotters of it were duely punished, I thought it would be some reproach to mee, if a Sonne should conferre nothing to the pious vindicating of his Fa∣ther. And yet it is not so much the defence of him, that I haue here vndertaken, as the vindicating of the Truth it selfe, which your Ma∣iesy hath so much disdained, though in a good cause, to haue beene so ill handled by a furious and inconside∣rate writer. Our Aduersaries shall be more indifferent to you ereaf∣ter, if your Royall Maiestie be of∣fended with the forgeries which they bring to maintaine a bad cause, when You are so much offended with the falshoods that are brought

against them by others, that would otherwise seeme to haue vndertaken the defence of a good cause. And though such may please themselues with their owne fancies, whom any thing wil please that maketh for the vpholding of such a Religion as they professe; yet it was most proper for your Sacred Maiestie (whose Learning and Loue of purer Reli∣gon are of equall eminencie) both to detect, and to shew your Royall indignatiō against these Impostors, that were cloaked ouer with so faire an appearance. Surely happy is our Cause, that hath uch a Defender! For who can now doubt of the Truth of that doctrine, which must haue nothing to defend it, but the Armes of Truth it selfe? Whereore

I present vnto your Maiestie, with all humility, that which I haue here written for the Truth, not one∣ly because You were so graciously pleased to accept it before it came to publike view, but chiefly that I might oppose the Authoritie both of Your Sacred Power and exquisite iudgement against those Impostors, that durst presume to offer a false∣intituled Pamphlet to the patro∣nage of our most Noble and Gra∣cious Prince. God long preserue your Maiesty, the greatest of Kings, to flourish with all kind of happines, for these your Kingdomes, and his Churches benefit.
