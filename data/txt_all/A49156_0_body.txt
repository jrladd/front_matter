RIGHT HONORABLE,
IF I were not fully perswaded of Your kind acceptance of these Sheets, I should not be so bold to offer them to Your Honour: But the sensible expressions of Your great goodness and favour which I have already received, and the Approbation with which You were pleased to honor this Discourse when it came out of the Pulpit, at the time of my Recantation, will not suffer me to doubt, but that You will accept of it also now that it comes out of the Press.
I hope it will not be unserviceable in this Nation, to settle in the profession of the Truth the wavering minds of many too much inclinable to Popery: This Consideration, with the im∣portunities of my Auditors, have prevailed upon me to publish these lines: which I desire may be look'd upon as a testimony of the sincere pro∣fession
of my Faith, and of that Loyalty and Obedience, which I do hereby vow to the Gra∣cious Monarch of these Noble Kingdoms, where I am come to seek for a shelter. I might with reason expect to find it amongst Protestants; but the insolency and insulting humour of the Party that I forsake, and the affronts that I have already met with, even in the streets, since my profes∣sion, force me to flie to the Protection of Your Honour; whose extraordinary Abilities and Fi∣delity have given You so near an access to His most Excellent Majesty, and cause You to act so wor∣thily in that noble station, unto which Your own deservings and Your Prince's favour have pro∣moted You.
Your Generosity and Goodness will, I hope, pardon my present boldness, as proceeding from a thankfull acknowledgement of Your former favours, and from an earnest desire to be esteem'd, as really I am,
Right Honorable,
