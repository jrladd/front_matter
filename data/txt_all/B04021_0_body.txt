WHEN I the Coronation see,
Of all the Flowers the Queen,
Makes me to praise that Noble Day,
That Crown our Illustrious KING.


When I the ORANGE Lilly see,
That pretty Flower so clear,
Makes me to mind the ORANGE fine,
Our British Crown do wear.


When I do the Sweet-William see,
That pretty Flower so fine,
Makes me to love our William Dear,
That is Great Britain's KING.
