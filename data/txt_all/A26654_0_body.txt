My Lord,
THis Book doth humbly present
it self to your Honour, as the
First-fruits of my proficiency
in Christ, in a dress low and humble, be∣seeming
the Author.
Let others bring into the Tabernacle
(to borrow Hierom's words, Prol. in lib.
Reg.) what they are able: some, Gold,
Silver, and Gems; others, fine Silks,
Purple, Scarlet and Jacynth: 'tis well

with us, if we can afford Skins and Hair
of Goats.
However under this Veil is contained
something of the hidden Wisdom amongst
the perfect, giving an insight to the
Mystery of the Crucified JESƲS.
As such, be pleased to accept of it, in to∣ken
of sincere gratitude, upon the score
of so many benefits, due to your Name,
by,
My Lord,
