MOST HONOVRABLE, most Wise, most Worthy Lord, it is the second time I present a testi∣mony of my most humble obser∣uance to your honour: The beames of that splendor of goodnesse in you, haue shined vpon many sonnes of those two Sisters, the Church and Com∣mon-wealth, among whom I doe most ioyfully ac∣knowledge my happinesse, in obteyning an honoura∣ble promise, by the mediation of My royall Maister, the illustrious PRINCE.
The Widowe in the Gospell offered to the trea∣sure, a litle Money; the Woman a little Oyle, to her Sauiour: Another in the Story, a little water to
his Soueraigne: my little I offer to your honour, is much lesse then theirs: If this shall adde any life to my suite, and procure any more fauour from your ho∣nour, I shall acknowledge how you worthily imitate God him-selfe, who rewardeth an houres worke with a dayes wages: which God as hee hath already endowed you with the heart of Prudence, so I hope he will euer-direct your Lordship with his hand of Pro∣uidence, that you may bee famous to posterity, grati∣ous to This Kingdome, and glorious in His King∣dome: this I wish, this I pray for, thus I rest.
