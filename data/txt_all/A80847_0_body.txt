Gentlemen and Christian Friends,
I Know not to whom the inscription of this ensuing Discourse can more properly belong, then to your selves; the occasion of it being the sad Funerals of your deceased Pastor: it being spoken specially in your ears, and designed to affect your hearts, and di∣rect you to a serious Christian endevour under, and improvement of so sad a providence. To you there∣fore I do present it, not doubting your readinesse to patronize and defend it; of which had I no testimo∣ny of respects to my self, yet that high respect you did bear to your late hopefull and learned Pastor, wit∣nessed by your importunate desires of him, eminent delights in and unexpected union under his Ministry, with your sorrowfull celebration of his Funerals, and the importunate desires of many among you to read these Observations when you had heard them, doth give me good assurance. The scope of the following discourse was, and yet is to inform your judgements of the necessity of Ministers life, and so to affect your hearts with Ministers death: directing your mournings to be from a right Principle, that so they may regu∣larly stream into their due measure and proportion, and proper end: you must know every Minister falls
under a double notion, as in his life, so in his death, as a man, and as a Minister; in the one a member of humane society, in the other a main Pillar of Christi∣anity, in both he is desireable whilst living, and deplorable when dead. But you must know Nature entertains him under the one, and Grace under the other. Men are apt to admire acute parts, profound judgement, amiable carriage, and learned language, where they find it, but never regard the Office in which a Minister stands, and Authority by which he acts in his place; no, this is the work of Grace: for it is religion must teach men to receive a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, and to account of Ministers as the Ambassadors of Christ, and to esteem them living and dying for their work sake. Whilest I would not deny you the liberty of your lamenting your losse in your late Minister, by reason of his naturall parts and endowments, which I have noted to have been great; I would desire in speciall to find your sorrow Christia∣nized, seizing on your spirit, from the consideration of him as a Minister, spirituall Guide, and Father, and so witnessing that you lived under his Instructions, as under the word of God, not of man: and indeed un∣der this notion you have much cause to lament him; for that he was unto his Ministry excellently qualified, in it very industrious: and of the duties imposed on him by vertue of his Ministry, very consciencious for your good. And his death under this consideration is the sad Symptome of Gods displeasure, and of smarting influence on your Congregation. I have for some years observed your carriage in this case, in re∣ference to a Minister: your selves know, and I hope yet remember your sad divisions, and smarting di∣stractions
into which you fell on a Ministers relinquish∣ing his work among you: God was pleased to cement all, and settle you in peace and unity, and good tenden∣cy to order, by your now deceased Pastor; by whose death you are again liable to the like danger. I pray that you may be warned and preserved from it; and that you may lay to heart this hand of providence, in the losse not only of a man excellently qualified, but a Minister of the Gospel, very hopefull in and to the Church of God; to which end, I intreat your serious reading of this following Sermon, and if it prove in any thing effectuall, give God the praise; and that shal be the honour of him who unfainedly condoles your losse: and praying that the Lord may make up this breach among you, remains
