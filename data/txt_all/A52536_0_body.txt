My Lord,
THe Greatness of my Pre∣sumption in making this Address, would appear more legible from the Greatness of your Character, did not the Subject, here treated of, hold some Proportion with the Per∣son, whose Patronage it implores: In prefixing therefore your

Lordships Name to the follow∣ing Treatise, after the Example of most Writers, I do in the very Front shew the Sum and Abridgement of the whole Dis∣course, not of what I have writ, but of what really is possible to be written of the Worth and Excellence of Man's Nature. There are two Things which do more eminently denominate a Man; Capacity, and Courage; of which, one laies claim to the Head, the other to the Heart, but both to your Lordship. This those can witness, who have had the honour to stand within the Circles of the Court, and to be privy to the Debates of the

Royal Council, over which you now preside. Nay, the whole Nation can witness it, your great Vertues having so often shewn themselves upon the greatest Theatre, and to the Ʋniversal Benefit of this Kingdom, so that there is no man can be so blind as not to see them, nor so un∣grateful, if he hath any sense of his own, or of his Country's Safety, as not to own an Obliga∣tion to them.
The Quarrel which your Lordship did espouse, as it was the justest, so was it the great∣est of the Age, whether we con∣sider the Quality, the Number, and above all the Exquisite Con∣trivances

of the adverse Par∣ty, amongst which the old Sham of pretending Religion seem'd to be most Popular, which was no other than the Policy of the Algerines, who most design the Slavery of Christians when they hang out Christian Colours.
Insolence flew high when Fa∣ction was prosperous, which was at the Point of breaking forth into open Rebellion, so that a more Hellish Combustion had like to have subverted the Parlia∣ment House, than that design'd by the Powder-plot, had not His Majesty of Blessed Memory timely separated the Fire-brands. Before which time, even then

when the Royal Cause lay most ableeding, 'twas a piece doubtless of great generosity in one of such a Patrimonial Fortune, as that to which your Birth-right did entitle you, to espouse and defend it, for in case of Defeat your loss had been most considerable, and in case of Success, you could not expect an encrease of Fortune from any Office of the State; So that no consideration of your own Interest, but that only of Loyalty and true Honour could invite to Action: And yet let the Fortunes of Subjects be as great as the Exigences of Princes, the latter cannot be out of a ca∣pacity

of giving, nor the former of receiving suitable Rewards, and Marks of Bounty; This your Lordship has in some mea∣sure tasted of in the Hereditary Honours conferred upon your Blood, such a Reward being justly due to one, who with such Courage, Constancy, and Success did vindicate the Hereditary Rights of the Blood Royal, and the just Descent and Preroga∣tives of the English Crown. Your Counsels were Loyal, and (what is yet more rare) prospe∣rous not only in the effect they had, but also in the Benefit we all enjoy, since 'tis not to be doubted but that they smoothed

the way to the glorious and peaceable Succession of the wi∣sest and most just of Kings, un∣der whose Reign we cannot but expect Felicity.
The Preservation of Mo∣narchy amongst so many Trea∣sons as threatned it and the Kingdom, was as great and mi∣raculous as its Restoration; the Memories of those, who were eminent herein, will be Sa∣cred to Posterity: You had both of you the same Name; a Name which may it ever be au∣spicious, as it has been ever tu∣telar to this Kingdom, being now famous without a Fiction for destroying the Monster,

which was to be fed with no∣thing less than Royal Blood. The Monster of the Age, which had the Ravenous Wolf always gnawing in his Bosom, had fore-sight good enough of what your Counsels would produce, when he prevailed with the worst part (I had almost said the Rump) of a House of Com∣mons, to list you among those five ever Honourable and Noble Peers, whom they petitioned to be removed from attendance on His Majesty of Sacred Memo∣ry, for no other Reason, but be∣cause your great Abilities made you capable to discover, and your great Courage made you

resolute to oppose the Pernicious Practices of that Desperate Ca∣bal.
But as your Lordship has given ample Proof of the greatness of your Mind to∣wards the correcting of Pub∣lick Misdemeanours, I shall now crave leave to make trial of the same Magnanimity in Pardoning private Faults; And for this your Lordship will find sufficient matter, if you give your self the trouble to read the following Discourse, which how much soever it may be beneath your Acceptance, will not be found, I hope, beyond your Pardon, which if I can obtain,

next to your own Safety and Felicity is all that can be wisht for by
