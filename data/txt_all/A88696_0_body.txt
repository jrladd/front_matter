IT is a thing well-becomming the Majesty of an Emper∣our, to acknowledge himself bound to obey the Laws. Our authority depending on the authority of the Laws, and in very deed to submit the principallity to Law, is a greater thing then to beare rule. We therfore make it known unto all men, by the Declaration of this our Edict, that Wee doe not allow Our selves, or repute it lawfull to doe any thing contrary to this.

Justine in the second Book, speaks thus of Lycargns, Law-giver to the Lacede∣monians, He gave Laws to the Spartans which had not any: and was as much re∣nowned for his diligent observing of them himself, as for his discreet Inventing of them: For he made no Laws for others, to the obedience whereof he did not first submit himself. Fashioning the people to obey wil∣lingly, and the Prince to Govern uprightly.
