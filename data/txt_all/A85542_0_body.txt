SIR,
IT is above thirty yeeres since the Lord hath brought mee to be an in∣habitant of Woolchurch; And for the greattr part of this time, the providence of God hath so ordered it, that I have enjoyed your ac∣quaintance, which hath been pro∣fitable, both to the outward and in∣ward man, although of late, by reason of your great and high imployments for God and man, there hath not been that personall society as heretofore; yet I often see you to participate in the best and excellent places of sound Doctrine, in the way of truth and sal∣vation, which with the knowledge I have of you, hath often moved my heart and spirit, to supplicate the God of heaven for you, as for my self, to whom it hath pleased God to make his Truth so known, as to make mee a childe of it above twenty

yeeres since, which heavenly Principles had I so heeded and improved as I ought, I might have been by this time a strong man in Christ Jesus. How ever, Sir, I must confesse to you, Gods mercies have been more and abundantly greater then my own miseries; and notwithstanding mine own naturall indis∣position and unaptnesse to the good and streight way of the Lord; yet hee hath so magnified his good will and compassion, as thereby to make mee one, though the least of his Disciples, who therefore cannot, nay dare not, but speak the things I have seen and learned of him, notwithstanding the Crosse and per∣secution that attend on the obeying and declaring the truth, a part whereof you may see, if you please to take view of these few ensuing lines, where you may observe, that the testifying to the abundant mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ manifested in the Sacrament, as in the Word, even for this, many are offended and rise up against mee, and do as much as in them lies, to make the world believe, that though they know me, yet they know me not; so as that I am seen, and not discerned: and yet I fear not for to speak, though I care not to be known, except to you and the whole houshold of faith, to whom the Lord continue his love and goodnesse, which shall be ever the prayer of him, who is truly yours and theirs,
