SIR, your many fauours, and my small deserts, make mee study how to discharge my selfe of ingratitude, which not knowing better how to doe, then by the labour of my spirit, to shew the nature of my loue, I haue thought good to present your patience with this little volume of varieties, in which, though the Title promise no matter of great worth, yet it may be, if you peruse it, you shall finde somewhat that you may like in it: howâˆ£soeuer it be, it may serue you in the Winter, to keepe you from sleep by the fire side, and in the Summer in shady walkes, to passe away idle time.
In briefe, wishing it of that nature, that might come neere the worthinesse of your acceptation, I leaue it with my better seruice, to the fauor of your good discretion: and so in all humilitie rest,
