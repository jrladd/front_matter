Honoured Sir,
THis Translation, to which I have been bold to fix your Name; From the first Instant,

that I was prevailed with to make it publick, I had an Ambition to present unto you; hoping it will not be unacceptable, in regard its quantity is but small, and therefore can∣not be any hinderance to your Studies, in which already you have made a progress, beyond what could have been expect∣ed from your years: Nor can I think it will be un∣pleasing in respect of its

quality, it being a piece of innocent Mirth, wherein my Author does with Horace, miscere utile dulci. Illustrating his History with Moral and Philoso∣phical Reflections; and takes occasion, now and then, satyrically to in∣veigh against several ill Customs, and Vices of the Age, carefully avoid∣ing all prophane and las∣civious Expressions (a crime too familiiar with

our Modern Writers in this kind) But that which I fear, may not so well relish, in this English Dress, with some, is his peculiar method both in Stile and Matter, which he observes, not only in this Piece, but indeed, in the rest of his Works; which are in all Nine∣teen Volumes, besides many excellent Plays; for which, he hath merit∣ed, in the esteem of his

own Country-men, a place in the first Rank of the Spanish Virtuoso's.
Now, Sir, having gi∣ven this account of the Work and Author, I might apologize for the careless oversights com∣mitted in this rough Draught; but when I shall have acquainted you that it was done ala volée only for my Diver∣tisement, at spare hours, and my practice in the

Spanish Tongue, I hope it will in some measure plead my excuse. As to the Faults of the Press, occasioned by my ab∣sence from London du∣ring its Printing, I con∣fess they are many and very gross, amongst which, some of my own, I hope, may pass with∣out distinction.
This, Sir, for your entertainment at your Times of Recreation,

I have presumed to de∣dicate to you, as a Testi∣mony of the respect and Service which I owe, as well to your Honoured Father, and the Virtu∣ous Lady your Mother, as to your self, that I may at least acknow∣ledge to the world, how much I stand oblig'd to you; though I shall ever be unable to ac∣quit my self any fur∣ther,

than by the Desires and Passions I have ever to appear in the Quality of
Honoured Sir, Your most obliged Humble Servant, Philip Ayres.
