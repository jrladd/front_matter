Right Honourable,
THAT this Sermon is made publick, is from the humble Regard that I am ob∣liged to pay to the ORDER I have re∣ceived.
I am the less concerned for what Censure may pass upon the honest Plainness of it, be∣cause I judge that I should much less have an∣swered
the great Importance of the Subject, if I had affected to treat of it upon any other Grounds than what the Scripture doth give us. For the most consummate Political or Moral Discipline can afford us no Weapons more equal to encounter with the Power of Death, than any of those Arguments it can suggest to us are to obtain a Respite of the per∣emptory Sentence from this inexorable King of Terrors.
If upon this account this Discourse may ob∣tain a favourable Acceptance, I shall have all that is aimed at by this humble Address from,
(Right Honourable)
