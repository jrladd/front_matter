My Lord,
ALthough I am too conscious of the manifold defects of this poor Discourse, to lay any claim to your Lordships acceptance, as the encouragement of its Publication; yet I have had such great experience of your Lordships favour, as to conceive some hopes, that it may find the same shelter with its Author under your Lordships patronage, and protection, When I first received your Lordships command, which engaged me upon this duty, I esteemed it a great Honour, than my own ambition could ever have aspired to. It was happiness enough for me to bear any part, how inconsidera∣ble soever, in that days Solemnity, which in the judgement of all, who have a real kindness
for the Church, was so signal an argument of Gods Care and Providence over it. But since by my intire resignation of this weak perfor∣mance (as I was in duty bound) to your Lord∣ships Judgement, it is no longer at my own dis∣posal, and that, which I thought too mean to at∣tend your Lordships CONSECRATION, has been thought fit to live with the remembrance of it: I have this further favour to request for it, that I may be allowed to thrust it forth into the world under your Lordships Name. I shall only add my unfeigned desires to the God of Heaven, that (as he has been pleased, in this declining Age, to raise up to his People, such an able instrument of his Glory, so) he would go on to give suc∣cess to your Lordships designs, answerable to the expectation of your Country, and the necessities of his Church. Which shall ever be the daily Prayer of
My Lord,
