THis Noble and Magnificent per∣formance,
renewing the ancient
spirit, and Honor of the Innes
of Court; being especially fur∣thered
and followed by your most
laborious and honored endeuors, (for his Maiesties
seruice; and honour of the all-grace-deseruing
Nuptialls, of the thrice gracious Princesse Eliza∣beth,
his Highness daughter) deserues especially
to be in this sort consecrate, to your worthy memo∣ry
and honor. Honor, hauing neuer her faire
hand more freely and nobly giuen to Riches (being
a fit particle of this Inuention) then by yours, at
this Nuptiall solemnity. To which assisted, and

memorable ceremony; the ioin'd hand and industry,
of the worthely honour'd Knight, Sir H. Hub∣berd,
his Maiesties Atturny generall, deseruing, in
good part, aioint memory with yours; I have sub∣mitted
it freely to his noble acceptance. The poore
paines I added to this Royall seruice, being wholly
chosen, and commanded by your most constant, and
free fauour; I hope will now appeare nothing neg∣lectiue
of their expected duties. Hearty wil, and
care enough, I am assured was employ'd in me; and
the onely ingenuous will, being first and principall
step to vertue; I beseech you let it stand for the
performing vertue it selfe. In which addition of
your euer-honour'd fauours, you shall euer binde
all my future seruice to your most wished Comman∣dement.
God send you long health, and your Vertues will
endue you with honor enough,
