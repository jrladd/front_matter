To the Church of CHRIST Meeting at Stepney, over whom the late Reverend Mr. MATTHEW MEAD was Pastor, Christian Salutations.
Honoured and Beloved,
TO whom more Aptly can I address my self, than You; since that which affords the Subject Matter of the ensuing Essay was once your Esteem and Delight; the very mention of whose Name, (in the Hearts of all truly Gracious) at once commands both Love and Re∣verence. Therefore not to revive the thoughts of your Loss, and with it renew your grief, in the Death of that late Eminent Star of Virtue, Mr. Matthew Mead, is this Poem to your view and Patronage; but to Testifie the unworthy Author's Ve∣neration to the Ashes of so Great and Good a Man. The Theme in∣deed deserves a far better, and more skilful Hand, for I may justly com∣plain with the Poet,
My Oaten Reed no Lofty Notes can Raise,
And Lofty Notes alone can reach his Praise;
Yet tho' I'm short in Pow'r, accept my Will;
And let my Love atone my want of Skill.

I could indeed have wish'd that some more Inspired Pen had Sung his Obsequies; but waiting long, and finding none enter the Lists in so Emi∣nent an Emergency, I have adventured forth: For why should Worthy Mead steal silently to his Grave? Tho' my Notions may be high yet the Work must needs be rough and unpolished, since performed by so mean a Hand; and especially considering the mournful Occasion; for is it possible that Tears should distil in Exact Numbers? But I shall not apologize any further; or to insinuate my self into any of your Fa∣vour, or good Opinion, either of my self or Performances, (as too many do) ex∣pose any of your Names, or your Vir∣tues; the latter of which is, (and I pray God it may be more) conspicuous to all that are so Happy as to be ac∣quainted with you. If this Adventure of mine meets with your Candid Ac∣ceptance, and Favourable Construction, it will compensate my Pains, and animate me to be,
