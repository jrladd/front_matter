ALthough diuers learned mē of no lesse iudge∣ment than practise, haue here before translated and set forthe sundry bookes, conteining the most holsome and profitable preceptes of Physicke, wherin they seeme to haue opened, and at large de∣clared all such things as seemed necessarie and ex∣pedient to be had and knowen in this oure vulgar Englishe tong: yet neuerthelesse, I calling to me∣morie the notable sentence of Cicero, that euery mā is not alonely borne for himselfe but chiefly to pro∣fit his natiue Countrey, then his parentes, after∣warde his chyldren and friends, seeking a meanes whereby I myght profyte thys my natyue Coun∣trey, thought it best to translate this little treatise which was gathered out of the workes of the most noble and auncient Phisitions, Hypocrates, Ga∣len, Dioscorides, and Auicen, by one Petrus His∣panus, which (although he chaūced in a barbarous and rude time) was a man of great knowledge and long practise: vnto whiche worke conteyning alone∣ly the simple and bare practise, I dyd adde before euery chapter as briefely as I coulde, the causes and signes of the syckenesses, and diseases, trusting thereby bothe to gratifie and somewhat ease the paines of the reader, so that he neede not elsewhere to seeke the causes & signes of suche diseases, whose remedyes were conteyned in this booke, and vpon that consideration I byd also translate and adde therevnto the Aphorysmes of Hipocrates, redacted vnto suche an order, that as the members of mans body be disposed to receiue some one discase & some another, so the Aphorismes, which entreate of euery
 disease that may happen to that member be gathe∣red together into one chapter, beginning at the head and so in order to the feete: and also because men oftentimes desire to knowe the names and proper∣ties of compounde medicines, I did translate a lit∣tle booke of suche compoundes drawen out of Me∣sue by one Iacobus de Partibus, whiche woorke I haue redacted to the selfe same order that the Apho∣rismes be in: and furthermore bicause I would gratifie the Reader, and woulde not he shoulde be ignorant in the names and weight herein contay∣ned, I haue herevnto added two tables, of ye which the firste dothe briefely expresse suche simples and compoundes as doe either comfort or purge any di∣sease or hurtfull humour infecting any member of mans bodie, and the seconde expoundeth certayne generall names of medicines and weyghtes com∣monly mencioned in this booke, and thervpon haue made an ende of this rude and simple worke, em∣ploying my whole labour and diligence to set the same forthe as truely and as nye the authors mind as I coulde, not thinking but that there doe some remaine therin, both bycause the barbarous and A∣rabicke termes whiche the author doth chiefely vse, and of the diuerse and sundrye opinions of most no∣table and well learned Phisicions, aswell in the names as in the natures of Herbes and symples, and especially that we be either ignorant or desti∣tute of Englishe names for a great sorte of them, yet I did as nighe as I could, followe Dioscori∣des, and in such things as I coulde not finde in him, I did confer Fuchsius, Ruellius and Dor∣stemius together, and folowed the iudgemēt wher∣in they dyd all or the most parte of them agree, and in the Englishing thereof I and all other whiche intende any such worke are much beholden to Mai∣ster
 William Turner, who with no small diligence hath in both his herballes most truly and sincerely set forthe the names and natures of diuerse herbes, vnto whose iudgement and correction and all other learned in the moste necessarie science of Phisicke, doe I submit this little worke and treatise, desi∣ring them most hartily to take in good worthe this my first laboure, and to accepte my good will, not thinking it to be done to hurte any man, knowyng what a perillous thing it is for them that be not learned both in the complexions of men, Age, Re∣gions, and time of the yeare, with the knowledge of the origin and causes of the diseases, to take vpon them the cure of any pacient, and that rather they shall doe hurte than good, with the sole and onelye practise therof, except they doe thervnto adde great knowledge and perfyte iudgement had with paine∣full studie and long practise, therefore I would that all such rashe and temerarious persons should per∣fectly knowe, that it was neuer my minde or wyll that this worke shoulde be set forth to maintayne their filthie lucre and blinde boldnesse, but chiefely o be a token and signe of the entire desire I haue to set forthe the thing which shoulde be acceptable and pleasaunt to the Reader, and I woulde that it should be for the vse and profite of suche honest per∣sons as will modestly and discretely (either in time of necessitie when no learned Phisition is at hand. or else conferring with some learned man and vsing his counsell) minister the things herein conteined, and goe about the practise thereof, and vpon these most honest and godly considerations, I take vpon me this heauie burthen and hard prouince, therfore I shal most hartily desire the gentle reader to par∣don my audacitie and beare with my slender iudge∣ment, and not to dispise this simple worke bycause




 it is not garnished with colours of rethorike and fine polished termes, but rather to consider that Phisicke is an Arte contente onely to be plainely and distinctly taught, and nothing desirous to be a∣dourned and deckt with eloquence and gay painted sentences: wherefore I trusting to the sincere and indifferent iudgement of the Reader, doe entirely desire him to pray with me to him that created Phi∣sicke of the earthe, and commaunded that we shoulde honour the Phisition, to preserue this realme of England in most prospe∣rous and continuall health, and to en∣dew the inhabitantes thereof, with perfyte vnderstanding and the most desired knowledge of his holy worde. Amen. (∵)
