NOble Gentlemen, your words spoken for me in the High Court of Chancery, the First day of Trinity Term, 1675. were, like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver, they are fit to be Recorded to posterity, to encourage other Worthy Persons that now live and may succeed you, to be kind and take part to assist Prisoners, for they can be grateful (if ingenuous,) you little thought what you then spoke for me, would be the subject and occasion of all these following Lines. The First, I took it to be my duty to present to God as my Thanksgiving; And then to you
(which bountifully rewarded and encou∣raged my gratitude.) This unexspected mercy did so raise my contemplations, (which were formerly exercised in vain∣er fancies) 'twas God and you that raised my Meditations on more Diviner Poems, if there be any thing in them that be good, let God have the Glory, and you as his Instruments, and the for ever most thankful acknowledgments of your fa∣vors, to the infinite comfort of
From my lodging in the Mint in South-wark, March 10. 1676.
