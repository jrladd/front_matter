SIR, though without suspition of flatterie I might in more ample and free tearmes, in∣timate my affection vnto you, yet hauing so sensible a taste of your generous and noble aisposition, which without this habite of ceremony can estimate my loue: I will ra∣ther affect bre, though it should seeme my fault, than by my tedious complement, to trouble mine owne opinion set∣led in your iudgement and discretion. I make you the Pa∣tron of this Epistle of the Blacke-Prince, which I pray you accept, till more easie houres may offer vppe from mee some thing more worthy of your view, and my trauell.
