SIR,
AT Your being in Redding, about what time the Kings forces relinquished that place in May 1644. I presented unto You a paper, De jure Regnandi, et Regni, wherein was contained the heads and chiefe points of that Subject, and therein I promised to give farther satisfaction, which I hope I have now effected to the satisfaction of all indifferent men; and I have thought fit to dedicate it to Your Honour, to whom I first of all tendered the Epitome: remaining
October 27. 1645.
