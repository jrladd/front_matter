HONOURABLE SIRS,
MAN had at the first, and so have all Souls before their entrance into the Body, an Explicite Methodi∣cal Knowledge; but they are no sooner Vessel d, but that Liberty is lost, and nothing remains but a vast confused Notion of the Creature. Thus had I only a Ca∣pacity without Power, and a Will to do that which was far enough above me. In this perplexi∣ty I studied several Arts, and put them into pra∣ctice: For my own sullen Fate hath forc d me to several Courses of Life; but I find not one hither to which ends not in Surfeits or Saciety, and all
 the Fortunes of this Life are Follies. Thus I ram∣bled over all these Mathematical Inventions or Sciences, Wherefore (Honourable Sirs) I ha∣ving Composed, out of my poor Studies, this Mi∣scellany, and considering there was nothing in it more useful for your Service than the Art of Sur∣veying, knowing that you bestow Surveyors Offices upon many, but divers may be wanting in the Knowledge and Labour of the Art; my self once enjoyed both in your Honours Service, by the kind thankful Remembrance of my much Honou∣red Patron: but Envy soon eclipsed my Office without desert, and left me only my Art: There∣fore (as St. Paul saith in another Case) I will wait with Patience until my Change will come; and in the mean time I am your Honours humble Ser∣vant, and humbly prostrate these my poor Labours at your Honours Feet, begging your Patronage thereof; knowing, That there was never any thing so well contrived by the Wit of Man, that hath not been subject to the Censure and Mis∣construction of the Envious: Nor do I at this time (in the Production of this) expect Immunity from the Censorious Criticks of this present Age; yet for such was this Work never intended, but only for the Judicious, whose candid Censures I dare abide: But yet not without labour and difficul∣ty can Books have passage into the World; there∣fore to the end the placid Fruits of these my La∣bours (now grown up among the wild Grapes of the Field) may be cherished and preserved from the turbulent Storms of discontented Spirits, it
 now being come to its Maturity and Perfection, must humbly implore the Protection of some Ho∣nourable Persons to defend it: And being well assured (Sirs) of your Honours most Heroick and Candid Dispositions, I humbly cast this into the Arms of your Humanity for Shelter and Prote∣ction; not doubting but that your refulgent Rays shining thereon, will be sufficient to annihilate and dispel the most dark and misty Clouds ascend∣ing our Horizon; which will not a little strengthen both my present and future Ʋndertakings for the Publick Good, and excite the Author to a grate∣ful Acknowledgment of your Memorable Virtues, and to echo forth the Praises due to your Names and Eminencies. All that I have endea∣voured, is to profit others, and to make my diligent and studious Reader and Practicioner able to be∣nefit his Country (which, certes, is no more than the Common Law of Humanity requires at all our Hands) and not, like some, to bury their Trea∣sures in the Ashes of Oblivion; which puts me in mind of that excellent Saying of Tullie, Non no∣bis solum nati sumus. Wherefore (Honourable Sirs) I have endeavoured, in as plain and suc∣cinct a Method as I could imagine, to lay down the Art of Surveying, a new way, by the Ma∣riners Sea-Compass, which is the best Instrument for their use and purpose, it agreeing so neer their Traverse Rules at Sea, that there is very little difference. And likewise I have shewed the Sea-men the Land-man's Art of Surveying and Gauging all sorts of Vessels, and plain Superfi∣cies
 and Solids; the Art of Gunnery, Artificial Fire-works, and Astronomy, in the following Book; and so furnished the whole Work with such Theorems and Problems, Geometrically, Instrumentally, and by Calculation, as are most ne∣cessary and subservient thereunto: And there∣fore (Honourable Sirs) you being able to protect it, I most humbly commit it to your gracious Pro∣tection, resting,
Sirs,

St. Georges, or the Pill, neer Bristol, Mar. 25. Anno 1669.
