MADAM, Your Noble Favours whiles that I
Did in the Tower of London Prisner lye
For sundry yeares; may now in Justice call
For some expression of my Thanks, though small.
Having no better meanes to testifie
My gratitude, than this small Poesie,
Devoted to your Service, Æ²se and Name;
I crave your Kinde Acceptance of the same,
And those thereto annexed; fruites of my
Imprisonment; who shall both live and dye.
