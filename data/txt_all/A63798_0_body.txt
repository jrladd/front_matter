THESE following Letters, which were occa∣sionally Written both at the Request of di∣vers Friends and Country-men at home, as well as of some Strangers from abroad; their various Questions then readily answered, accor∣ding to that Capacity and Talent the Giver of all Gifts hath endued me withall, in conformity to that grand and important Commandment of our Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, that we should not hide our Light under a Bushel, but expose it on the House-top, are now contra∣ry to my original Intention in Writing, exposed to pub∣lick View; the Consideration of their being loose Papers, and so subject by Time and other Casualties to be lost, of my having the number Seventy in my view, and daily expecting to be called to Inherit that Land, which Adam, the Great Father of Mortality, hath entailed upon all his Posterity; as also that the Publication of them might prove of some moment and advantage, not only to private Persons, but even to the publick, in the present and future Ages, together with the Auxilary Influences of some of my Friends and Acquaintance, powerfully disposing of me thereunto; tho' at the same time I cannot but expect to meet with some Readers, who will alledge our Performance in this kind to be unne∣cessary, seeing many of those Subjects here treated of have been already handled in some of my former Wri∣ings;

and not only so, but that in some of the said Let∣ters themselves, the same things seem to be repeated and insisted on again and again, which even in the soft∣est Language can be represented no otherwise than Tau∣tology in us.
But to this, it may be easily answered, that Necessa∣ry and practical Truths cannot be too often taught and repeated, till they are well understood, learned and di∣stinguished; neither were the great Mysteries of Time and Eternity, by any other Way or Method manifested or brought to light, but only by a constant Repetition, according to the Saying of the Great Apostle of the Gen∣tiles; that the visible things that appear and are con∣stantly repeated, shew the great and invisible Power of God: And indeed it is impossible for any Mortal to speak or treat aright of God or Nature, or to display the wonderful Operations of things, and their respe∣ctive Complexions, without knowing and distinguishing the original Principles, I mean the four grand Quali∣ties, which some of the ancient Philosophers called Sul∣phur, Mercury and Salt; but are since better and more familiarly understood by our common Names, of Saltish, Bitter and Sweet Qualities, which are the said first Principles, both in the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, and according to their respective Degrees or Gradations in each Creature or Thing, such not only is the Form, Nature and Name thereof; but he that can distinguish the Signature; and which of these four hath the Ascending or Ruling Power, in any Animal, Herb, Seed, Tree, or Mineral, together with the Strength or Debility of the other three Qualities, in their several degrees; such an one, according to his proportion of Knowledge and distinguishing Faculty, is thereby rendred capable to judge of the Constituent parts of the said Thing or Creature; and therefore no Man can pretend to know or prescribe the Nature, Vir∣tues or Vices of any Created Being, without this Know∣ledge;

for you are to understand, that all visible Beings or Creatures do arise and deduce their Birth from Num∣ber, Weight and Measure, that is, from certain ori∣ginal Principles, which the Great and Wonderful Crea∣tor hath limited them to, or incircled in, which are as so many Eternal Fountains, from whence all the Great, Noble and Beneficial Sciences, Arts, Trades and Employments in the World take their Birth, and undoubtedly the nearer any one comes to, or imitates Nature and God's Law, that is his Original, the more curious and excellent such a Person becomes thereby.
But for a more clear Illustration of this grand Truth, even to meaner Capacities: Are not the original Foun∣dations and Principles of all Sciences, Arts, Trades and curious Inventions, bounded and incircled within the compass of such and such Numbers? and whatever curious Notion or Thing is brought to light, must be done by a constant Repetition of those original Numbers, and more particularly in the wonderful and demonstra∣tive Science, the Mathematicks, whereby so many use∣ful and excellent things are effected, for the Preservati∣on and Benefit of Mankind: Is not all done and perfe∣cted by a constant and perpetual Repetition of Nine Fi∣gures? And are not the Seven Notes the very Centre and Basis of all Musical Harmony, both Vocal and In∣strumental, no Lesson, Division, Song or Tune, being to be made or composed without the perpetual Repetition of them?
The like is to be understood of the most ingenious and admirable Art of Representation or Painting, where∣in, by the apt mixtures of the Seven Colours, (for the original ones, which are called perfect Colours, do not exceed that number) a Skilful Artist can represent the various Colours of Animals, Vegetables, Mine∣rals, &c.
The same may be farther demonstrated in Words and Speech, and that too in a most wonderful manner,

it being a grand breach of the Mathematicks, tho' few consider and apprehend it; and what a strange thing is it, that the vast and amazing varieties of things in the almost infinite Distributions of them, together with their Productions, Terms and Utensils for all Sciences, Arts, Occupations and curious Employments, should be all moved, distinguished and understood by the Composi∣tion of the Four and Twenty Letters, without which no Man can understand or distinguish one thing from ano∣ther; which said Letters are but so many Notes or Figures, that while each stands alone, and is not joined to any other, does not distinguish or express any thing that is intelligible, and therefore are then of no Force, Use or Virtue, but being aptly joined and compounded, wonderful things are performed by them, so that all Sci∣ences, Arts, Employments, and whatever else is per∣formed and brought to pass by Mankind, are effected by a constant Repetition of the above-mentioned Nine Figures, Seven Notes, Seven Colours, and Four and Twenty Letters; so, but more especially, all Words, Rhetorical Discourses, Lofty and Elegant Speeches, are nothing else but a constant Repetition of the said Four and Twenty Letters, whereas in themselves and alone, they are of no more Use than one Figure in the Mathematicks, one Note in Musick, or one Colour in Painting.
The like is to be understood in all inferior Arts and Occupations, to instance only in Architecture, wherein the Free Mason and Carpenter are limited to such a number of Fundamental Principles, let their Building or Structure be great or small, or of what Fashion and Ornament it will, that any one that does but understand and distinguish them aright, can at first sight imitate any Form or Ornament in that kind, and if it be the Interest of the Artist, or that the same be required of him, he can readily Invent both Fashion and Orname too; whereas otherwise nothing can be performed, but

is it were, by chance; and hence it is, that any Person or Persons, in all Sciences, Arts and Trades, become more or less excellent in proportion to their Capacities, and Inspection into the Fundamentals of Arts, or their respective Occupations.
This being a sure and constant Rule, that the Son is the Off-spring of the Father, and an Epitome in all Par∣ticulars, there being nothing more clear, than that e∣very thing must bow to its original Law, and imitate that from whence it took its Birth.
It is moreover worth remarking, that as Sulphur, Mercury and Salt, or the four grand Qualities before∣mentioned are Predominant or Graduated in any thing, accordingly it becomes better or worse, and the Figures, Tastes and Complexions of Matters are in proportion thereunto, so the like is performed by the Use of certain Humane Numbers, as has been instanced in the nine Figures, seven Notes of Musick, and four and Twen∣ty Letters, as 'tis also in the Principles of all inferior Arts and Trades, which do arise and take their origi∣nal Birth from the said grand Principle, which is God's Eternal Law and Method, there being but one Text in the Practise of all Sciences, Arts and Mysteries of Trades, insomuch that there is acertain Concatenativs Power and Agreement between the original Principles and natural Powers, and their respective Operations, for as there is no Humane Numeration can comprehend the Stupendious variety of Nature, in respect to the Things or Creatures, Forms, Complexions, Virtues or Vices contained in the four Worlds or Elements; so on the other hand, it has never been known, that any Man has attained to the utmost limits, or highest pitch of any Science, Art or Trade; and therefore the most Skilful and Learnedst Person that ever was in the World, had much more to learn, than he had attained to, so that as all the Heavenly Bodies, glorious Constellations and admirable variety of Luminaries, do constantly move

within their own Circles or Orbs, keeping time and place to a moment, both in their Risings, Settings and Configurations; and that none of those numerous and distinct Powers do at any time exceed their Circles, o prescribed Boundaries, so all Science, is not only per∣formed by a constant Repetition of the same things, but is also incircled within such Bounds, Limits or Num∣bers, as is before-mentioned, which it is not in the power of the Artist, to break thro' at any time; inso∣much that it is manifest, that all things have a certain Ground or fundamental Principle, whereon all the Su∣perstructures do depend: But tho' it be true, that the inward Mystery and Law of God is the same, as the outward, and that on the other side the outward Myste∣ry is understood by the inward; yet so it is, that there are rarely found any Eyes so quick-sighted, as to pene∣trate into both, which to understand and distinguish, is the greatest Blessing Humane Nature is capable of, as to be ignorant of the same, must be the greatest Defecti∣on and Misery, for otherwise a Person must act and practise every thing by Chance, Custom and Tradition, living according to dark, evil, fierce and unequal Principles, the Consequence or rather Effect whereof can be no other than Ignorance, Stupidity and Degene∣ration, which gave rise to the Restrictive or Coercive Laws of Magistracy, and without which Civil Society could not be long Supported nor Maintained.
But, without proceeding any farther this way, if the Intelligent Reader do but consider and weigh what has been already said, I do not doubt but he will clearly see the Repetitions that fall out now and then in some parts of this Book, are not barely so, but serve to advance same other Notion, which could not have been done without; for suppose now a Man were to describe the Genuine Nature, Qualifications, Complexions and Operation of an hundred sorts of Herbs, Fruits, Seeds, Trees, Minerals or Animals, now to effect

this great Work, must he not first necessarily consider the respective Gradations of the four grand Qualities, how they stand in their Government, whether equal or the contrary, and which of them have the Dominion and Ascendency? These, I say, are the Texts, whereby he must describe the Natures, Virtues and Vices of them all, and within the Limits and Operations of these four Qualities, he is bound and incircled, and he that has obtained this Spring-head of Blessing, to know God, himself, and the Nature and Operation of things, cannot fail at sight to describe any Animal, Vegetable, or the like, and to show their inward Virtues, Vices and Complexions, according to his Gift, Circle or Orb he moves in.
But, notwithstanding the Objection made concerning the Repetitions that are dispersed here and there in these my Letters, the reason and necessity whereof I have ful∣ly set forth in the Premisses, which are sufficient to sa∣tisfy the Scruples of the understanding Reader, and which is all I care for, yet I am to take notice, that there are a great many things contained therein, that are perfectly Novel, for tho' there is nothing new under the Sun, and that most of the Subjects have at one time or another been handled after a sort, yet I dare avow it has been quite after a different Method and Form, and no such Super-structure erected from fundamental Prin∣ciples are herein set down all along: It cannot be expe∣cted, and it will be too tedious to enter now upon Parti∣culars, they will best appear in the Perusal of the Work it self, and therefore as I cannot see any thing farther to be Objected against me, than that I have been Pro∣lix, and have not confined my self within the just Li∣mits of an Epistolary Method, all that I say, is, that upon my Resolution to publish them, as aforesaid, I found it necessary, in the Revising them, to alter some, to enlarge and exemplify others, and to add divers things in divers parts of them, by way of Illustration, which

made them spin out to such a length, as you see them, and was wholly designed for the Reader's Benefit and Satisfaction; but if I have been so Unhappy as to fall short of my intended Aim, I am sorry for it, both upon his and my own account, and heartily beg his Pardon, who am,
