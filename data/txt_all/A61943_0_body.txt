I Send you here (my Lord) that Discourse enlarged, which frighted the Lady into a cold sweat, and which had like to have made me an Atheist at Court, and your Lordship no very good Christian. I am not ignorant that the fear of Socinianisme at this time, renders every man that offers to give an account of Religion by Reason, suspected to have none at all: yet I have made no scruple to run that hazard, not knowing why a man should not use the best Weapon his Creator hath given him for his defence. That Faith was by the Apostles both highly exalted, and severely enjoyned, is known to every man, and

this upon excellent grounds; for it was both the easiest and best way of converting: the o∣ther being tedious, and almost uselesse: for but few among thousands are capable of it, and those few not capable at all times of their life, Judgement being required. Yet the best ser∣vant our Saviour ever had upon Earth, was so far from neglecting or contemning Reason, that his Epistles were admired, even by those that embraced not the Truthes he delivered. And indeed, had the Fathers of the Church only bid men beleeve, and not told them why, they had slept now un-Sainted in their Graves, and as much benighted with Obli∣vion, as the ordinary Parish-Priests of their owne Age.
That man is deceivable, is true; but what part within him is not likelyer then his Rea∣son? For as Manilius said,
Nam neque decipitur ratio nec decipit unquam.
And how unlikely is it that that which gives us the Prerogative above other Crea∣tures, and wholy entitles us to future happi∣nesse,

should be laid aside, and not used to the acquiring of it.
But by this time (my Lord) you finde how apt those which have nothing to do themselves, are to give others trouble. I shall onely therefore let you know that your Commands to my Lord of Middlesex are per∣formed; and that when you have fresh ones, you cannot place them where they will be more willingly received, then by
Bath, Sept. 2.
