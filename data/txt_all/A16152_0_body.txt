MOST RENOWMED AND VER∣tuous Princesse: I am in hope, it shall seeme no presumption, to offer these my rude labours to the sight & view of your Maiestie: The cause is Christs, as being the defence of his will and ordinance, who hath mercifully placed and mightily preserued your Highnes in your fathers throne: and expecteth, as it were in recompence, that the power which he hath giuen you, and honor which hee hath heaped on you, should bee im∣ployed to protect his trueth, and safegarde his Church within your Realme. Which your religious and gratious disposition so wisely considereth and so carefully putteth in execution, that not onely with good liking you beare the title to bee DEFENDOR of the Christian faith, but with manie daungers and some enuie you stoupe to the verie burden of harbouring the afflicted, and helping the distressed by all conuenient and godly meanes: not refu∣sing with Princely courage and constancie to endure the displeasures and abide the disfauours of such as seeke to restoare or vphold the decayed and accursed kingdome of Antichrist. A thing rare in so high a state, but a great

blessing from God our Sauiour, to be both protectour of his persecuted seruaunts, and partaker of his sonnes re∣proches: which perhappes worldly mindes doe warilie shun: but your Christian wisedome well perceiueth to be the assured signe of Gods fauour, and to haue his vn∣doubted promise of an immortall and farre more glori∣ous Crowne, than this, which hee hath alreadie possessed you with.
This good & long experience of your Maiesties most willing inclination and affection to plant pietie and re∣lieue innocencie, might embolden mee, if there were no farther cause, to presse to your Highnesse for the Patro∣nage of so good a purpose: but as the case nowe stan∣deth, besides this generall inducement, I haue a speciall nforcement to leade mee to this onset. The whole dis∣course doth so directly and namely treate of your Maie∣sties Scepter, Sworde, and Crowne, that neither I might aske protection of anie other but of your royall person, nor such demurres be published without your Highnesse leaue.
So is it, most gratious Soueraigne, that certaine your subiectes borne, forsaking your happie gouernment and their natiue Countrie, vpon doubt of Religion as they pretend, haue feated themselues in two Societies or Col∣leges, which they call Seminaries, founded and furnished at the Popes charges beyond the Seas, the one at Rome, the other at Rhemes:Apol. chap. 3. with purpose thither to drawe the best wittes out of England, as well from both vniuersities as from other Grammer schooles, there to traine them to their fansies, and faction, and thence to direct them backe into this Realme, for the

reconciling of poore soules, as they say, to the Catholike Church: or in truer termes, for the peruerting of simple and ignorant persons from the duetie which they owe to God and your Highnesse.
This attempt beeing throughlie looked into by the Lordes and others of your Maiesties most wise and wor∣thie Counsel, was thought, as in deede it is, verie dange∣rous and pernicious to your Realme, that the capitall en∣uier of your state, disturber of your peace, and pursuer of your person should allure and abuse so great a number of your subiectes with a shewe of liberalitie: and haue them in such bondage, by the Rules of their Societie, that they must obeie the will of their SVPERIOR, (the Popes Agent among them) none other-wise than they would the voice of Christ from heauen:Campian in his 2 article. (for so them-selues professe:) and thereupon by your Highnesse authoritie, proclamation was giuen out, that none should depart the Realme with∣out licence: and a time prefixed for those that were a∣broade, to returne home, vpon some paines there speci∣fied, & farther threats if your Highnesse were thereunto prouoked.
The Guiders of these vngodlie Societies in steede of obeying your Highnesse edict, fell to defend their owne act in departing this Land and resorting to Rome: as also the Popes intent in erecting those Seminaries, and ap∣poincting a number of them to be sent into England to reduce the Realme to the Romish obedience, which they call the faith of their fathers. And because they were to laie the fault of their vnlawful departure & long absence, either on them-selues, which they would not, or on the

state from which they were estraunged, they (decla∣ring their founder by their fruites) spared not in a slaunderous pamphlet of theirs intitled, An Apologie and te declaration of the institution and  of the two Englishe Colledges, to charge your Christian, milde, and aduised regi∣ment with no lesse crimes than heresie, tyrannie and blasphemie: as the onely causes why they depar∣ted and absented themselues so long from their natu∣rall countrie: agising none of your Ecclesiasticall Lawes to bee orderlie or duelie made (but calling them straunge and vnnaturall dealings,fol. 7 violent disorders,fol. 38 which to all posteritie must needes breede shame & rebuke, repugnant to the lawes of God, the church & nature) and most of all spurning at the act and othe which abo∣lished the Popes vsurped power out of this Realme, and declared your Highnesse to bee the SVPREME bearer of the sworde, and establisher of publike Lawes within your Dominions (a power confirmed to Prin∣ces by God, and therefore not to be infringed or clai∣med by Priestes or Popes.) And to make their mat∣ter more saleable in the eares of the simple they vsed all their Rhemish art and eloquence to deface and tra∣duce that right of your authoritie and bande of our o∣bedience with cauilling Sophismes & florishing termes: as if that SOVERAIGNTIE vsed by your Highnesse were a thing improbable, vnreasonable, vnnaturall, impossible:fol. 10 and the O THE yeelded by vs fol. 12 intollerable, repugnant to God, the Church, your Maiesties honour, and al mens consciences. Of such wastfull words, and mightie bragges that booke is full, hauing other∣wise for matter and proofe nothing in it, that is worth the reading, much lesse the answering: as being rather

a Rhetoricall declamation of an vngracious witte, than a substantiall confirmation of their actes and attemptes against God and the Magistrate.
But, as it seemed, they trusted rather to their pra∣ctises, which haue beene of late verie rife with the Church of Rome: than to their proofes, of which theie bee vtterlie destitute: and therefore they dispatched into your Highnesse Realme vnder the conduction of one more presumptuous than learned, (as his wri∣ting and disputing, whiles hee liued, declared) a whole swarme of Boie-priestes disguised and proui∣ded at all assaies with secrete instructions how to deale with all sortes of men and matters, and with commis∣sion from Rome to confesse and absolue such as they should winne with anie pretence or policie to mislike the state and affect noueltie, and to take assuraunce of them by vowe, othe, or other meanes, that they shoulde bee euer after adherent and obedient to the Church of Rome and to the faith thereof: which there made the ruder and vnwiser sort beleeue was christian and Catholike.
Religion onelie founded in their mouthes, and the faith of their Fathers: and yet that poison they caried couertlie in their hearts, and cunninglie in their bookes, that your Maiesties deceiued and beguiled Subiectes by the verie sequence of their Romish faith and absolution were tied to obeie the Pope depriuing your highnesse of the sword and scepter: & bound to assist him, or whom he should send to take the same by force of armes out of your Highnesse handes.
I knowe, most noble Soueraigne, they stoutly de∣nied this, and earnestly protested in open audience, that they had no such meaning, but for their partes did account your Maiestie their lawfull and true Prin∣cesse, and taught all others so to doe (hauing first ob∣tained, like wilie Friers, a dispensation at Rome, that to auoide the present daunger, they and all other their obse∣quents might serue and honour your Highnesse for a time vntill the bull of Pius the fifth might safely bee executed):The dispen∣sation of Campian & Parsons. and it may bee the common sort of such as they peruerted, were not acquainted with these hainous mysteries: but yet this was the full resolution of them all, which I last reported, as well appeared by their examinations: and this verie conclusion stood in their written bookes as a ruled case, that they must rather loose their liues than shrinke from this ground-woorke that the Pope maie depriue your Highnesse of your Scepter and Throne: and the reason is added, because, saie they, it is a pointe of fayeth,In their cases of conscience: the 55. Arti. and requireth confession of the mouth, though death insue.
This daungerous, if not diuelish Doctrine was not printed nor publyshed to the sight of all your Sub∣iectes, vntill the time that some of the chiefe procu∣rers and kindlers of this flame, for these and other interprises of lyke condition and qualitie were by the iust course of your Highnesse Lawes adiudged to death. After whose execution the almes-men of An∣tichrist sawe no remedie, but they must either leaue their brethren as rightlie condemned for hatching re∣bellion vnder a shewe of Religion, and bee in daun∣ger

to dissolue the plotte which they had laide to bring this Lande to the Popes subiection, (the true ende and intent of their Seminaries and full repaiment of all his charges) or else with all their cunning vnder∣take the quarrell of their vn-holie father: and pleade the cause of their vnluckie brethren. Hauing no bet∣ter choice, they resolued, as venturers must, that haue a desperate case in hand, to trie what successe they might gette by facing and shifting in such sort as the simple shoulde hardlie discerne them. To that end haue they put foorth A Defence of English Catholikes: Wherein according to their wonted vaine, manie thinges are statelie and stoutelie auouched, but nothing attempted or inten∣ded to bee prooued, saue onelie the Popes power to depriue Princes: which with all furniture of witte and woordes they labour to inferre: not shaming to saie, that Subiectes bearing armes against their naturall Princes vpon the Popes warraunt, do an holy, iust and honorable seruice:The Defence of Catholikes the 5. chap. and that this hath beene the faith of this Land euer since it was conuerted vnto Christ.
Against this canker, consuming the verie soule and conscience where it taketh holde, I thought it not amisse,In the third part of this booke. to oppose the Soueraigne salue of Gods eter∣nall will and commaundement, and to let it appeare to your Graces people, that Princes are placed by God, and so not to bee displaced by men: and subiectes threat∣ned damnation by Gods own mouth if they resist, from which no Popes dispensation shall saue them: and therefore the Iesuits Doctrine in that point to be as wic∣ked, as their proofes bee weake: hauing neither Scrip∣ture,

Councell, nor Father, for a thousande yeares that euer allowed, mentioned or imagined anie power in Popes to depose Princes.
I haue thereto added a confirmation of the right which the Lawes of this Lande do attribute vnto your Highnesse,In the second part. and an explication of that othe, which the Iesuits so much stumble at: laieng my foundation in the sacred testimonies of the holie Ghost, and persuing the same in the continual practise of Christs church for eight hundreth yeares & vpward, (so long as there was either godlines in Bishops to regard their duties, or corage in Princes to call for their owne) and iustifieng euerie part thereof seuerallie and sufficientlie by diuine and humane both authorities and examples.
The Iesuites absurdities and allegations pretended a∣gainst your Maiesties interest to beare the sword ouer all persons and in all causes, without dependence or refe∣rence to anie earthlie tribunal or superior, I haue like∣wise particularlie refelled, and proued them both imper∣tinent to their purpose, and nothing obstant to that Su∣preme power of the sword which is claimed and vsed by your Maiestie: but their obiections to be meere cauils & mistakings of a matter which they do not or will not vn∣derstand: as also their flieng this Realme, and running to Rome I haue examined,In the first part. and not onelie found them re∣pugnant to the ancient lawes of the Conqueror & other your noble progenitors, but also shewed great difference betweene the Catholike Fathers writing and sometimes going to the Bishop of Rome, as to their fellow seruaunt and a dutifull subiect to the same state that they were: &

our English Italians giuing him an Antichristian power to turne & wind the whole church at his will, and dispose kingdomes and displace Princes, if they be not obedient and suppliant to his Censures.
Lastlie because the temper and colour of all their wic∣ked sayings & doings is the catholik faith & the catholik seruice,In the fourth part. I haue entered a speciall discourse, that the refor∣mation of the church in this Realme made by your Maie∣sties power & lawes is wholie & truelie catholike: such as the Scriptures do preciselie command & the ancient fa∣thers expresly witnes was the faith and vse of Christes church for manie hundrethes.
These things most (religious & worthie Princesse) I haue done sincerely, that the doctrine & precepts of our Saui∣or might take place before the deuises & pleasures of mē: familiarly, that the meaner sort of your subiects which are most obnoxious to this infection might perceiue the way to recouer their former health: & temperatly, that the e∣nimy should not thinke himselfe rather illuded then aun∣swered. Which if it please your most excellent Maiestie to like & alow that it may passe to the hands of your people, I trust in Christ that such as haue any feare of God before their yes, and care of life to come will hold themselues satisfied, and the rest be better aduised before they runne headlong into that extreeme perdition of bodie & soule, and horrible downefall of disobedience, and infidelity to God, and their Prince.
The king of kings and Lord of Lordes blesse and pre∣serue your Maiestie, and as hee hath begun a good and glorious worke in you, and in this Realme by you:

so continue the same by lightening you with his holie Spirit, and defending you with his mightie arme as hee hath doone from the daie, that hee chose you to bee the Leader and Guider of his People: that you maie long keepe them in trueth and peace by the assistaunce of his grace, to the praise of his glorie, increase of the God∣lie, and griefe of his and your enimies. Euen so Lord Iesus.
