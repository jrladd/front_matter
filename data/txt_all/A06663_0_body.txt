IT is not without a
greate cause (moste
godly Lady) that y•
holy Apostle sainct
Paule desired the
Thessalonians to holde faste y•
doctrine,ii. Thes. ii. that he had taught thē
afore, and not sodenli to be mo∣ued
from their knowlege & vn∣derstanding,
nor to be troubled

neyther by spirite, neyther by
wordes, nor yet by letter. For he
vndoubtedly did afore se by the
reuelacion of Gods spirit,Mat. xxiiii. that
there should aryse false anoyn∣ted
and false preachers, whiche
shoulde worke great miracles
and wonders, insomuch that if
it were possible, the very elect &
chosen people of God shoulde
be brought into errour, whiche
also shoulde saye, beholde here
is Christe, or there is Christe,
bringing in damnable sectes, &
vtterly denyenge the Lord that
bought them,i. Pet. ii. as Peter sayeth.
He considered the imbecillitie,
weakenes and chyldishe hertes
of men, whiche, excepte they be
corroborated & fortefied with y•
strēgth of Gods spirit,Heb. xi. are sone
caried aboute with diuers and
straūge learninges, embrasing
no lesse gredely that that is to

them selfs noysome and pestife¦rous,
than that whiche is good
and profitable, as we at thys
present time se dayly before our
eyes, both in the Papistes and
Anabaptistes, with suche other
damnable sectaries. Therfore
this moste excellent Apostle de∣sired
the Thessalonians, yea, &
so many of vs,Math. x. as professe Christ
vnfaynedly, to perseuer & abide
in the worde of trueth euē vnto
the ende, that we may be saued,
& not lightly to be moued with
the subtile and crafty persuasi∣ons
of them, that teache weake
and beggarly tradicions with
humayne constitucions,Galat. iiii. which
gyue hede to fables and mens
commaundementes that turne
away the folowers of them frōTit. i.
the trueth, whiche professe that
they know God, but with their
dedes they deny him, inasmoch

as they are abhominable & dis∣obedient,
yea,. Timo. iii. and vnmete to al
good workes, which loue their
owne pleasurs more than God,
hauinge an vtter apperans of
godly liuing, but denyeng the
power therof, whiche runne frō
house to house and bringe into
bondage both men and women
lodē with synne, which are led∣de
with diuers lustes, euer lear∣nynge,
and neuer able to come
vnto the knowlege of the truth
which are enemies of the crosse
of Christe,Phil. iii. whiche call that is
euill good, and y• is good,Esa. v. euill
& ce.Act. xx. In fewe, whiche are raue∣nynge
wolfes, not sparyng the
flocke. Dothe the world wante
these enemies of Gods glory?
Haue not we also nede to take
hede vnto the aforesayde whol∣some
admonicion of the holye
Apostle saincte Paule? Doeth

not the worlde at this daye no∣rishe
such vngodly monstures?
What age hath bene withoute
them syns the beginning of the
worlde? What nede I to speke
of that great whore of Babilō,
the mother of fornicacions and
abhominacions of the earthe,Apoc. xviii.
whiche hath made dronken wt 
the wyne of the wrathe of her
whoredom all the nacions of y•
earth, yea, the very kinges and
rulers of the earth haue playde
the aduouterers with her. The
fornicaciō of that most filthy &
stinking strompet is so openly
knowen, & made manifest vnto
vs, both by godly bokes and
learned sermons, that it nedeth
not here to be rehersed. And
woulde God, that as the name
of this Babilonical strompet is
exiled out of mennes mouthes
and rased out of bokes among

vs, so in lyke maner her whore∣dome
I meane, the popysh and
deuelish decrees, which fighte
with y• manifest worde of God,
mighte ones be vtterly exiled,
banyshed, and for euer dryuen
away from the bondes of Chri∣stendome,
that all thinges in
the Christen publique weale,
both in this and in other foren
Realmes mighte be instituted,
ordered and appoynted, accor∣dinge
to the veritie of Christes
moste blessed Gospell. But be∣sides
this monstrous beaste,
are there rysen, not a few, which
are playne Antichristes, & daily
labour to obscure the glory of
God. No maruel, seyng that in
the Apostles time,i. Ioan. ii. iiii. blessed Iohn
cōfesseth that there were many
Antichristes and false Prophe∣tes.. Ioan. i
What nede I to speake of
them, which teache that Christ

by his moste precious death de¦liuered
vs onely from original
synne? Which teache that man
is iustified by his owne workes
and not by the fayth alone,Roma. iii. viiii. that
he hath in Christes moste bles∣sed
death? which teache, that by
obseruinge mens tradicions e∣uerlasting
life is gotē?Ephe. ii. Which
teach that external ceremonies
iustifie and put awaye synne?
Whiche teache that mā is able
of his owne strengthe to fulfill
the lawe, and to satisfie the iu∣stice
of God?i. Timo. ii. which teache that
our prayers can not be hearde
without the intercession of o∣ther?i. Ioan. i.
Which teache that all ho∣nour
pertayneth not too God
alone? whiche teache that the
bloude of oure sauioure Iesu
Christ is not a sufficient Pur∣gatoryei. Ioan. i.
for all oure synnes, ex∣cept
we be broyled, boyled and

perboyled in y• Popes fornace?
Whiche teache that the Lorde
Christe gaue not hym selfe soHeb. vii. ix. x.
plenteously a swete smelling sa¦crifice
to God the father for vs,Ephe. v.
that with the one oblacion of
hys moste blessed body,Mah. ix. he hath
made thē perfect for euermore,Marc. ii.
that are sanctified?Luc. v. Which tea∣che
that God alone forgeueth
not synne, but synnefull man
also? Are not these very Anti∣christes?
enemies of ye crosse of
Christ? defacers of Gods glory
fals annoynted? fals preachers
rauening wolfs? cloudes with∣out
water?ii. Pet. ii trees without frute?
raging waues of y• sea, foming
out their owne shame? wādring
starres, to whome is reserued y•
myste of darkenes for euer? mē
pleasers, hauing men in greate
reuerence for auauntage sake?
curssed chyldren, whiche haue

forsaken the right waye, & are
gone astray? these are they dou∣btles,
of whome bothe Christ &
his apostles bidde vs take hede
in so many places of the holy
scripturs. Agaynst these ought
all men to fighte, that tender y•
glory of God.Luc. xxii. To confounde
these Antichristes, ought we to
sell walet, scrippe, cote, with all
that euer we haue, and to bye
vs a swerde, I meane y• swerde
of the spirit, which is the worde
of God. And to this ende that
I maye prouoke other vale∣auntly,
and boldely to fighte a∣gaynste
these aforesayde Anti∣christes.
I according to the ta∣lent
geuen me, haue taken vpō
me to wrastle with those wicked
Papistes, which beleue & teach
that God alone doeth not for∣geue
synne, but man also with
y• same power, & like authoritie

Whiche thinge I take in hāde
the more gladly, because I se y•
thys kynde of doctrine is a
great defacing of Gods glory,
and that it throweth many into
great daūger, forasmuche as
they looke for that at the hand
of man, whiche onely is the gift
of God, yea, it encourageth not
a fewe to lyue dissolutely, and
without the feare of God, seyng
they are perswaded, that if the
Prieste layeth his hande ones
vpon their head, and saye Ego
absoluo te, they are quyte dely∣uered
of their synneful burden,
and though they returne strey∣ght
waies vnto their filthy vo∣myte,
what skylleth it? Ego a∣soluo
te will dispatche all togy∣ther.ii. Ts. ii.
If any man sitteth in the
temple of God, bosting him self
as God, surely they do it, which
take vpon thē the office of God,

that is to remitte and forgeue
synne.Esa. xi. But they shall be slayne
with the breath of the Lordes
mouth. The order, which I wil
obserue in the treatise folowing
is this. Fyrst I wil proue with
manifest scriptures, that God
alone forgeueth sinne. Secōdli
that the Priest is but a minister
appoynted of God, to declare
fre remission of synnes to the
truly penitent, to declare, I say
and not to forgeue. Thirdly I
will aunswer to the obiections
of the aduersaries, and vtterly
wype them awaye, restorynge
the scriptures to their natiue
sense. At the laste, leste I should
seme to despyse the true & Chri∣sten
absolucion of a faythfull
Minister, & the vse of y• keyes,
whiche consisteth in preaching,
I will expresse my mynde, con∣cerninge
them also, so that to

any indifferent person, I doubt
not, but that my iudgemēt shal
appeare godly and confirma∣be
to the true vayn of the holy
scriptures. Thys littel trea∣tyse
(mooste vertuous Ladye)
I sende vnto youre grace, as a
testimonye of my redye ben
good will, and seruiseable hart
towarde youre grace, beynge
prouoked herevnto, thorow
youre excedynge loue and fer∣uent
zle, whyche youre mooste
honorable Ladyshippe beare,
bothe towarde the woorde of
God, and the true professours
of the same, moste humbly, be∣sechynge
your grace, to take in
good parte, thys my rude and
simple gifte. God, whyche by
hys holy spirit, hath wroughte
in your hart this enter loue to∣warde
the Gospell of hys sonne

Christe Iesu, moughte also
bringe forthe in youre grace
plenteousnes of good wor∣kes,
vnto the glory of
hys blessed name,
and the profit of
hys holy con∣gregaciō.
AMEN.
