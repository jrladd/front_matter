EARLE OF CARLILE,  OF DONCASTER, BARON OF SALEY, one of his Majesties most honorable Privy Coun∣cell, & Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter.
RIght Honourable, and my singular good Lord, when I preached this Sermon, I applyed my selfe to this time of affli∣ction, studying more to
profite, then please: yet it did receiue a greater approbation from all, than any thing could deserue that proceeded from my weakenesse. And your Honour was pleased to demaund a Copie of it, which I here humbly present vnto You, in a poore and plaine stile as it was preached, beseeching your Lordship to take in good part this small offering, from him who shall alwayes pray for Your Ho∣nours prosperitie in this life, and happines hereafter.
