RIght gracious Soueraigne, I doe here humbly present vnto your Highnesse, the holy Labours of that worthy Seruant of Christ Mr. RICHARD GREENHAM, painfullie collected, corrected, and published for the good of Gods Church, by my late deere Husband Mr. HENRY HOLLAND, a Preacher of the Gospell in your Highnesse Cittie of London. VVhich I am bold to offer vnto your excellent Ma∣iestie, partly in respect of the Author, a man renow∣ned for his rare pietie and paines, and for his singular dexteritie in comforting afflicted Consciences: partly in regard of the worke it selfe, so well accepted and approued in the Church, that this is now the fift time it hath ben published. But chiefly because my husband

hauing a little before his death bestowed great care and paines in collecting and preparing for the presse, the fourth and last part of these workes (which in this edition is added to the rest) straightly and many times charged mee vpon his death bed to present and dedicate the whole vnto your Highnesse, as a pledge which he desired to leaue vnto the world, of his most dutifull affection, and earnest desire to doe your Ma∣iestie all the honour, and the Churches within your Highnesse dominions all the seruice that hee could VVherefore humbly praying that your excellent Maiestie would be pleased to accept the same at the hands of a poore widow, from him that is now at rest in the Lord, and hath (in part receiued the crowne of his labours: I doe earnestly beseech the God of heauen abundantly to heape all graces and blessings vpon your Highnesse and your royall posteritie in this life, and finally to set vpon your heads the crowne of euerlasting life and glo∣ry in the world to come.
