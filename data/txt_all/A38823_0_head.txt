To all those who (through the power of Christ in
them) have attained to esteem it their Wisdom &
long to be despised & accounted Fools by the World
 his sake and the Gospels: whose knowledge,
isdome and Guifts hath made them not Great and
 (according to the custome of the World) but
Little, yea Nothing in their own esteem; who
notwithstanding are the True Of-spring of
God, the Only Right-Wise and Hoâˆ£nourable
with Him, and the
Excellent upon Earth.
