Gentlemen,
IT is not unknown to most Persons that have known me, what Relation for se∣veral years last past I have stood in to you, and since we liv'd so friendly and kindly together for so long a time, I was resolv'd to do all in me lay, to part as fairly at the last, and to leave some certain Testimony of my Respect behind me: And since it is at this time the Indeavour of divers Learned Men in the Church, to Sweeten and Reconcile Mens Minds to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England, that so the Civil Power may not surprize them, without due warning, and weighty Reasons given, why they ought now especially to indeavour
an Union: Since several others are upon this Charitable, and Seasonable Design, I thought my Words might come among you with more Esteem and Reception than a meer Stranger's: And though I every way fall short of the worth of those other Persons, that have bended their Purposes this way, yet when I consider the Kindnesses I have re∣ceiv'd from most of you, in all other Cases, I cannot in the least imagine I shall be dis∣appointed in my Expectations, now, in this last piece of Respect I am shewing to you; and if it doth (in the perusal) any Person Service, I shall heartily thank God, and really Rejoice in my Brothers return.
