Excellent Lord,
SOlomon says, A Good Name is a precious Oyntment; and, I assure my self, such will Your Grace's Name be with Posterity; for your Fortune and Merit, both have been Eminent; and You have planted things that are like to last. I do now publish my Essays; which, of all my other Works, have been most current: For that, as it seems, they come home to Men's Business, and Bosoms. I have en∣larged them both in Number and Weight;

so that they are indeed a New work. I thought it therefore agreeable to my Af∣fection, and Obligation to Your Grace, to prefix your Name before them, both in Eng∣lish and Latin: For I do conceive, that the Latin Volume of them, (being in the Uni∣versal Language) may last as long as Books last. My Instauration I dedicated to the King; my History of Henry the Seventh (which I have now also translated into Latin) and my Portions of Natural History to the Prince. And these I dedi∣cate to Your Grace, being of the best Fruits, that, by the good increase which God gives to my Pen and Labours, I could yield. God lead Your Grace by the hand.
