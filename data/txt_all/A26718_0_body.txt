MAdam, or Mistris, Dame, or courteous Maid
Your vertues here in brief I have display'd;
If you be pleas'd these lines to over-looke,
For whose sweet sakes I pend this little Book,
In spight of envie, who so harsh did write,
Seeking for to eclipse your glory quite;
But you, like silver Cinthia doe appeare
Æ²nto your Phoebus, usher of the yeare;
Or like those golden Stars so bright that shines,
Which spacious Heaven in its Orbe combines;
To you, faire Soules, this Work I dedicate,
Because that malice, vertue still doth hate.
I am no Pimp, nor Champion for a Whore,
To usher Puncks, or in a Taverne reare,
The wrongs of all good women I would right,
I am your Champion, and for you ile fight;
My Sword and Pen your honours shall maintains,
Saluting you, I rest, yet still remaine
