THe least Fish in the Waters, the least Seed in the Earth, the least Flie in the Aire, and the least Starre in the Firmament. (Honourable and worthie Knight) doe shew the glory of GOD, in their seuerall kinds; although not so great in quantity as do the Whale, the Cedar, the Eagle, and the Sunne: And the meanest

member in the body, the Foote, may performe a pro∣fitable seruice to the Head; although not so lawdable & worthy as the Hand. The consideration whereof, and the happie experience of your heroicall and most ver∣tuous disposition, who euer haue encouraged a wel mea∣ning minde in euery good and laudable action; maketh mee, although the meanest member in the Ciuill body, both venterous and hardie (in my duetifull loue) to of∣fer a litle Guift, as the Wid∣dowes mite, to your Chri∣stian view, and Honourable accept: by whose good ap∣proouement,

the reproch of presumption will not be im∣puted to a well meanyng minde, when as a Christian man being compared to a Tree, whose roote is Fayth, the body Holynes, the bran∣ches Charitie, the blossomes Peace, and the fruite Obedi∣ence; is not esteemed in the sight of God, or good men, by the quantitie of the sub∣staunce, but by the quality of the fruite. Wherfore, if your Honour shall vouchsafe by the sunne rising of your gra∣cious fauour, to nourish a tender Grift, now yeelding a small fruit vnto your taste; and to couer it with your

mercifull wing, from the bi∣ting and nipping stormes of vncharitable blastes: your most humble and deuoted protect, shal rest euer bound to offer vp prayers night and day to Almighty God for your Honors eternall felici∣tie, and for the prosperous and honorable continuance of your noble posteritie in this world, and their happy enioying of the heauenly blessinges in the world to come.
