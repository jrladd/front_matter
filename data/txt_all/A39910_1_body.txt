SIR,
BEing importuned by divers (Gentlemen, Ministers, and others of our Neigh∣bourhood) to draw up a full Narrative and Account of that late sad Providence (which hath filled the hearts and mouths of the Country round about us, the same whereof is also spread into remote parts) I was at last prevailed with to endeavour their satisfaction: And the rather because of a general rumour in the Country, that the man had declared se∣veral things to me of near concernment to himself, which he concealed from all other Visitants. That I might not therefore suffer such Reports to pass uncertain, nor be wanting in that which was by some urged as my duty; I did (by travelling, at several times, above sixty miles in the parts adjacent) enquire in∣to divers particular circumstances, which I was not before fully clear in: and have now at last set all down in plain words (sutable to such an account) that the meanest concerned to
know and make good use of the providence, might at first reading clearly understand it.
Sir, That I address this to you, is, that I may take an opportunity to make my hearty ac∣knowledgments for your learned and useful Discourses in the Pulpit upon this occasion, to the general satisfaction of your Hearers; and I must in my own name, and many of theirs, intreat, you would make the substance of them more publick from the Press, that the Readers may learn not to be too censorious in things of this nature, not yet to pass by so signal a Pro∣vidence without that just Observation it de∣serves, and due reverence toward that God who is known by the Judgments which he executeth, as you have fully shewed us. I hope, Sir, I invite you to nothing, but what your own Judgment accounts worthy your labour; and I am confident it will be no mean addition to your former elaborate services of God and his Church. In which that you may be long con∣tinued for his Glory, and the good of his Peo∣ple, shall be the hearty Prayer of (Reverend Sir)
