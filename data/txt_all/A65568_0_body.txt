SIR,
HEre is your Request; and I wish that you do not Re∣pent you of it: That you do not discover greater failings by deliberate Reading, then you did in the transient Hearing of this dis∣course. It hath received some en∣largement and alteration since I Preach'd it, and not without need; for the Truth is, the Subject was too great for me, and handled in too much hast: The Sermon being the immature conception of those few
hours, which that weeks exercise afforded me.
Sir, I am much afraid it will ne∣ver answer that esteem you was pleased to express for it, but if it may be (in any degree) serviceable to∣ward your attainment of the Glory it treats of, I shall be abundantly ho∣noured and recompensed, for thus exposing my self. The hopes whereof is the greatest motive and encouragement to this bold attempt of
Sir,
