May it please your Lordship,
THese Papers (which humbly offer themselves to your fa∣vourable acceptance and Pa∣tronage) were conceived and form∣ed, but laid aside some years before you did me that great honour to command my attendance on you and your Family, since which time by unusual accident, they have fallen into a hand kinder than my own, who judging them worth the publishing, and perswading me to it, they claim a Right to this Ho∣nour
of appearing in the world un∣der your Lordship's Patronage; if I had refus'd to let them be made publick, perhaps I should have been culpable; since they are thus publisht, I am sure (without omit∣ting a part of my duty) I could not but tender them to Your Lordship, which I do with a sense of their meanness and disproportion which they bear to your Lordships Great Abilities, Learning and Judgment. Yet herein this will be somewhat of an Apology for me, though some have owned their obligations and duty to Your Lordship in Pieces less disproportion'd, none have done it, or are likely to do it in a Piece equal to Your Lordship's Learning and measures of Judgment. The small summs of chief Rents are too poor to be made a Present to any whose abundance would refuse such an Offer; but when tender'd as their Right, they give a kind acceptance
and acquittance for few shillings or pence. In this humble offer I wave all pretence but this, That Your Lordship hath the best Right to any Publick Acknowledgment I can make of my obligations to You, of which I pray Your Lord∣ship's favourable resentment
