HAuing (Right Wor∣shipful) resolued with my selfe, to publish this little Treatise, & knowing it subject to much preiudice, ex∣cept it were graced with some worthye Patron, (I meane not by the learned, for they are too courteous, to be Carping; nor by the well minded, for they cherrish Science: but by Detractors, who hauing no learning to iudge, want no libertie to reprooue) I haue followed the

example of Metabo. King of the Volschi, who de∣sirous to deliuer his only Daughter frō al peril, & danger, consecrated and dedicated her to the Si∣ster of the Surne. So I no lesse carefull of my labours, then the King of his Camilla, with delibe∣rate, and aduised iudgement, wholy deuote, & offer my Booke to your fauour and protection; who being the true Maecenas of the Muses, and iudicial in their exercises, are of power to relieue my weaknes by your worthines, & to priuiledge me from enuy, though she were prest to deuoure me. If midst your generall fauour to all desert, your worship vouchsafe this particuler benefite to my industry; no day or time (as Tully coun∣saileth) shall define the memorie of your bene∣fits: But as a true remembrance of your fa∣uours, my future study and labour, shall be imployed to doe you all ready and willing seruice.
