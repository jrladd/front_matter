MIrrour of goodnes, most Illustrious Dame,
My prostrate Muse, (adoring your great Name)
Presumes here to present unto your Grace,
Your Anagramme; with all the rest in Place,
Whom you were pleas'd to honor in this Taske,
(The rarest Ladies of your Royall Masque.)
Together with a true Acrostique flame,
Aspiring from the Letters of your Name.
Pardon my humble Pen which (in your Fame)
Hath blaz'd the brightnesse of your Anaâˆ£gramme;
From whose caelestiall light, & vertuous mind,
These Ladies (All) the milk-white Path doe find,
(By your example) unto vertues height,
At which they ayme, with labour, and delight,
And in their Race, that way, do striue wch shal
Out-strip the other for the golden Ball;
Of these great Ladies, you the Leader are,
Who (like the Wisemen) follow you, their Star.
