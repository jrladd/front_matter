TO that clear Majesty, which in the North,
Doth, like another Sun, in Glory rise,
Which standeth fix'd, yet spreads her Heavenly
Worth;
Load-stone to Hearts, and Load star to all Eyes.


Like Heaven in All, like Earth in this alone,
That though great States by her support do
stand;
Yet she her self supported is of none,
But by the Finger of the Almighty's Hand.



To the divinest and the richest Mind,
Both by Art's Purchase, and by Nature's Dower,
That ever was from Heaven to Earth confin'd,
To shew the utmost of a Creature's Power:


To that great Spring, which doth great Kingdom's move;
The sacred Spring', whence Right and Honour streams,
Distilling Virtue, shedding Peace and Love,
In every Place, as Cynthia sheds her Beams:


I offer up some Sparkles of that Fire,
Whereby we reason, live, and move, and be,
These Sparks by Nature evermore aspire,
Which makes them now to such a Highness flee.


Fair Soul, since to the fairest Body joyn'd,
You give such lively Life, such quickning Power,
And Influence of such Celestial Kind,
As keeps it still in Youth's immortal Flower:


As where the Sun is present all the Year,
And never doth retire his golden Ray,
Needs must the Spring be everlasting there,
And every Season like the Month of May.



O many, many Years may you remain
A happy Angel to this happy Land:
Long, long may you on Earth our Empress reign,
E're you in Heaven a glorious Angel stand.


Stay long (sweet Spirit) e're thou to Heaven depart,
Who mak'st each Place a Heaven wherein thou art.
