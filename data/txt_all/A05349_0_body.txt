MOST REVEREND;
IT was by your Graces direction that this Sermon was preached; and now by the same appointment it is published: that the world may see it contayneth nothing but truth, and is free from undiscreet raylings, wherewith it was charged by them who dare adventure to censure us before they heare us.
Now these my small labours, and the labours of some few dayes, being the first fruits of my weake engine, I here present unto your Grace, to whom I owe my selfe, and all I have, much more my service, with the labour of my hands, head and heart, as most boun∣den. Indeed this small offering is no more equivalent to my debt, than a mole-hill is to a mountaine: But whatsoever my barren ground can afford, shall be e∣ver
at your Honours command: to which most hum∣bly I prostrate my selfe, praying alwayes, that God would be pleased to continue your Grace long unto this poore Church of Ireland, that like another Nehemiah, you may build up the walls of this decayed IE∣RUSALEM.
