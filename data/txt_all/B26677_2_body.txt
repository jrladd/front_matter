My Lord,
Your Lordship's unstained Con∣versation, and your universally most justly applauded Equity in your Sentences in that Great Court of Judicature, where you
 have the Deserved Honour to preside; doth enliven many with delightful hopes that Righteous∣ness shall in these Days be the Establishment of the Royal Throne, and of the whole King∣dom.
