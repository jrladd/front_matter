Madam,
ASI was casting in my Mind to present you with something in token of my high Esteem for
your Virtue, I hap∣pily met with these LAST HOURS of a young French La∣dy; in which I found so many things rare and ad∣mirable, useful and edifying, divinely transporting and inflaming, that I concluded it a Gift most agreeable and comporting with your Pious and Devout Inclinati∣ons;
and there∣fore was soon de∣termin'd in my thoughts to Dedi∣cate this Translation to you, as judging it (setting aside my own Faults) most worthy of your Acceptance. For what can be imagined more strange and won∣derful, than to see so tender an Age, so weak a Sex, so
delicate an Educa∣tion, not one∣ly combating the most formidable of all things, that King of Terrours, but tri∣umphing over, and trampling on him? What move Edify∣ing, than to behold the Power of Grace so gloriously in∣thron'd amidst the Infirmities of Nature, rais'd to their highest pitch, and
making them all serve as foils to its Divine Lustre? What more trans∣porting, than to hear a Soul woun∣ded with Divine Love, send forth its flaming Desires to the Glorious and All-Beautiful Object of them? Or what can be thought more en∣gaging and inci∣ting to Virtue, than
to see not onely the peaceful, but joyful Latter End thereof; and what great Triumphs & Exultations at∣tend it, even in the most difficult and affrighting Cir∣cumstances of the Last Scene of Life? In a word, MADAM, you may see here the miraculous and powerful effects of the RELIGION
you profess, and the GRACE you entertain and have chosen for your Portion and Orna∣ment; how no∣thing can stand a∣gainst it, how eve∣ry thing must turn to its advantage, and how all that oppose it, serve onely to adorn it with never-fading Trophies of Glory. I question not,
MADAM, but your reading of this Book will start many more useful and delightful hints, than are here men∣tioned, which may afford you Advice and Comfort in this your Pilgrimage through the Valley of the shadow of Death, to the Land of Bliss and Glory. But I de∣tain you too long from the Banquet
within, where (ac∣cording to Sampson's Riddle) you'll find the Eater giving Meat, and the strong one sweet∣ness. So commend∣ing you to that Grace whose Triumphs are here so signally exemplifi'd, I re∣main with all due Respect,
MADAM,
