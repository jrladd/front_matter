Madam,
BEsides the Cogni∣zance I have had of you, when it was my happiness to live
among some of your Noble Relations, your friendly deportment, and the favourable Aspect which you have been pleased to cast upon me, hath very much rendred me your Debtor. And I knew not what other way to express my self grateful, than by present∣ing yo with some of that Treasure, which, through the help of the Spirit, I have digged out of the
Sacred Mines of Scrip∣ture. The Tractate which I here dedicate to you, is small, but the Subject treated on, is of emi∣nent and singular worth. Pearls may lie in a little room; and a soveraign Electuary may be given upon a Knive's point. The Supper of the Lord is a matter of weighty importance, as having in it the very pith and quin∣tessence of the Gospel.

Madam, Admire distin∣guishing Grace, which hath made you Noble, not only in blood, but in spiritual EndowmentsNobilitas cujusque rei est, sibi secundum sse.: How deeply are you ob∣liged to God, who hath given you an insight into the Mystery of Life, which will abide with you, when the Flower of Beauty shall fade, and the Feathers of Honour must lie in the dust. Ma∣dam, let Jesus Christ be e∣ver
in your thoughts, you are never out of his. Let that dear Saviour lie as a bundle of Myrrh between your Breasts; Cant. 1. 13. delight much in the Galleries where the King of Glory is held. Cant. 7. 5. Let those hours be counted golden, when you are at Free grace's Table, and Christ sups with you, and you with him. I have no more at present to add, only desire your Candid Interpreta∣tion,
& kind reception of these few impolished lines: So entreating the Lord to enrich you with all spiritual and eternal Bles∣sings, I take leave, and rest,
Madam,
