May it please Your Excellency,
SInce nothing contributes more to the Advancement of Natural Knowledge, than the Encou∣ragement of great and eminent Per∣sons;
not only Custom but Interest hath generally inclined those, who employ their time in the pursuit of it, to shelter the Fruits of their La∣bours under the Protection of noble Patrons: For as there can be no greater Motives to Virtue and Mo∣rality, than the Favour of an Omni∣potent Power; so in the Affairs of this World, we are most inclin'd to pursue, whatever may deserve the Esteem of great Men, or lead us into their Favour.
And if the Tree of Knowledge flourishes most under the favourable Patronage of Princes, the Interest of, Learning will, at the same time, be a good Plea to extenuate my Pre∣sumption, and a great Argument why I should lay this at your Ex∣cellency's Feet.
For, Illustrious SIR, whilst amongst the happy Number of His Majestys
Favourites, we behold Your Excel∣lency dignified with Titles of Ho∣nour, at the same time we are sur∣prized to see, that no Titles can be so great but Your Excellency's Cha∣racter adds a Lustre to, and increases the Dignity of them: A character! which, could I convey it down to future Ages, I must be able to re∣present, in the most lively Colours, All the Virtues of a good and pious Christian; the meek and liberal Temper of a Puissant and Noble Prince; the Wisdom of a Counsel∣lour, and the Qualifications of one, to whose Judgment and Sagacity the Administration of the Government of a Kingdom hath been, in a great measure, committed, by the most Ju∣dicious and Sagacious of Kings.
But, Illustrious SIR, since the draught of so Noble a Character as Your Excellency's is too hard a Task
for a Pen better qualified than mine, I have sufficient reason to decline it; and shall rather reflect on the Happiness of this Kingdom, whilst so Great a King hath made choice of so Wise a Counsellor; and the great Felicity of the Commonwealth of Learning, whilst under the Patro∣nage of so Illustrious a Prince as the Duke of BOLTON; and particularly on my own Happiness under Your Excellency's Protection, which is the more augmented by this opportunity of professing my self,
Most Illustrious SIR,
