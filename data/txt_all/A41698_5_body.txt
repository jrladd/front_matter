My Lord,
WHen I was last at Laving∣ton, I had the good For∣tune to see the Extraordinary Person to whom the following Epistle is sub∣scrib'd; and from an occasional saying of your Lordship's, took the hint of the Poem, which, therefore, I now

here present to your Lordship. Some will, for their own Interest, think it a Paradox, and some, I cou'd hope methinks, will not. However, at worst, if the Argument fail in the Main, the Iudicious and Lovers of Truth, will, by the way, find so much Vanity and Knavery discover'd, as may perhaps, encline 'em to forgive me. But, above all, if it please your Lordship, 'twill be my greatest satis∣faction, having resolv'd for the fu∣ture (next my Devotions to Heav'n) to make that the chief study of,
My Lord,
