Right Honourable, &c.
AS I cannot think you could have any other Motive to command the publication of this Discourse, than your customary Civility; so I am sufficiently sensible that it brings nothing along with it that can deserve your acceptance, but the entire submission I shew to your Orders, in an instance so contrary to my private inclinations.
I could have been extreamly pleased to have had an opportunity of acknowledging your obligations, without exposing the weakness of my services; but even this way I must confess I am not without some satisfaction, in de∣claring publickly the sense I have of your unanimous kind∣ness in the ready choice you made of so unworthy a Ser∣vant, and the pleasure I take in being related to a Compa∣ny, whose Members are so considerable in themselves, and whose Commerce is so beneficial to the publick.
This is an honour which all my Predecessors in this Employ have been sensible of; but I must acknowledge

it yet a more particular advantage to my self, since it gives me a capacity of continuing in a Family, in which I have lived so much to my content, since I had the happi∣ness of being admitted a Member of it, wherein I have seen so much exemplary Vertue, so frequent Charities, so constant and regular a Devotion, and so profound a re∣spect for all things that are Sacred, that as it must be esteemed by all good men, so it cannot but be especially desirable for a Divine.
Concerning the Discourse it self I have nothing to say but that it is a plain persuasive to a Vertuous and Religious Life, and does not pretend to affected orna∣ments or beauty of style, that it designs to profit rather than delight, and so bears some resemblance to its Au∣thor, whose services, though they cannot be pompous, yet shall alwaies be faithful, whose constant prayers shall be for your temporal prosperity and eternal happiness, and who shall make it his business to endeavour to supply his want of Abilities, by acquitting himself with all fidelity and diligence as becomes
My Lord and Gentleman,
