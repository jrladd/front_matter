Right Honourable,
AMong the many that justly admire your Lordships Worth, and seriously bless God for the Happiness of London, in that the management of the Affairs of so great a Body, next under our Soveraign Lord the King, is committed into the hands of a Person of such known Integrity and eminent Loyalty, the Author of this Discourse doth cheerfully and heartily pro∣fess himself to be one.
That this Discourse was acceptable to your Lordship when delivered in the Pulpit, I must needs impute to that Candour and Goodness which seems innate and connatural to your Lordships disposition, as is readily acknowledged by all that have but the least knowledge of your Lordships Wisdom and Prudence, so conspicuous in the good conduct and auspicious government of that great City: for though the Matter of it be incomparably great, yet the Manner of handling it falls infinitely short of the worth and excellency
of so divine a Subject, which ought to be highly esteemed by all Christians, and had in everlasting remembrance by the Sons of Men.
For 'twas a designe highly becoming the Son of God, to oppose the Devil, that grand Enemy of all Goodness, and to confront the powers of Darkness; to deliver Men from the dominion of Sin, and to secure them from the Venge∣ance of Almighty God. Indeed, a designe of this nature re∣quired a Person of such excellent and extraordinary Worth, such divine Wisdom, and infinite Power, such ex∣act Holiness, and Almighty Goodness, to destroy the Works of the Devil, and to bring everlasting Righteousness into the World.
And if the World had not been strangely infatuated when the Son of God became Man, neither the Jews would have required a Signe, nor the Greeks sought after Wis∣dom, when he did so miraculously manifest his power to the ruine and destruction of the Devil, the most malicious and implacable Enemy of Mankind; whose insulting Tyranny was far more severe and arbitrary over the Jews, than the cruellest opposition of the Roman Empire; and his Policy infinitely above the Philosophical Wits and Reasonings of the Gentiles: that if the one had not trusted too much to their humane Wisdom, and the other longed too affectio∣nately for a temporal deliverance, and a secular happiness, they must needs have celebrated the Nativity of the Son of God with the most solemn Hallelujahs and Hosanna's, have admired him as the great Power of God, and the Wisdom of God, who was made Man, that he might become unto men Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.
But the Men of this Generation are most of all without excuse, that believe him to be the Son of God, and his
coming into the World on purpose to destroy the Works of the Devil, and to take away the Sins of the World, and shall yet remain in slavery and subjection to the God of this World; and so do despite to the Holy One of God, and deny the Lord that bought them.
I hope therefore no eye will look with envy upon this Discourse, wherein no Dispute is commenced, no Contro∣versie promoted, but with the great Impostor and deceiver of Souls; against whom every Christian ought to employ his utmost knowledge and skill, and exert his greatest vigour and zeal, being by the solemnity of an Oath, the Sacrament of Baptism, engaged thereto.
And since this was the grand designe of Christ's coming into the World, I conceived an Argument of this nature very proper and seasonable at this time, wherein we were to celebrate the Nativity of Christ, the Incarnation of the Son of God.
And because your Lordship hath commanded that this Discourse, whatever it be, should become publick (which else had remained as private as the Author) as I have e∣ver esteemed Obedience the best Sacrifice, and a ready sub∣mission to the pleasure of our Governours in all things law∣ful, a most excellent Duty, and extreamly becoming all Christian Professors; so in compliance with your Lordships Command, it is now sent forth into the World: and I hope, under the Patronage of so honourable a Person, may be re∣ceived with the like kindness and good affection, as it was by your Lordship.
And God grant that by the influence of his Grace it may be some way useful to those that read it, to carry on that great end and designe for which it is intended; I mean, to encourage men against the Wiles and Temptations of the Devil; and to perswade them to the works of Righteousness
and Goodness, of Piety and Devotion, of Justice and Cha∣rity, of Humility and Obedience, of Sobriety and Tempe∣rance.
God Almighty direct and assist your Lordship in the management of those great Affairs committed to your charge, and continue you long in that famous City, to the Glory of his Name, the Credit of true Religion, the Honour of our Soveraign, and the happiness of the People at present under your Government; that you may reap in this World satisfaction of Mind in the discharge of a good Conscience; and in the World to come, everlasting Life: Which is the hearty Prayer of him who is,
MY LORD,
Jan. 1. 1682/1.
