YOur Muses, th'one a Youth, and one an Infant,
Gaue me two Panegericks at one Instant:
The first Pen,This Gen∣tleman was pleased An∣nagrāmati∣cally to call me Water-Rat, or wa∣ter Art, Wc I doe An∣nagramma∣tize Water-Rat, to bee A trew Art. the first line it pleasd to walke in,
Did make my Art a Rat, and like Grimalkin,
Or a kinde needfull Vermin-coursing Cat,
By Art I play, but will not eate your Rat.
I thanke you that you did so soone determine,
To Annagram my Art into a Vermine,
For which I vow, if e're you keepe a Dayrie,
Of (now and then) a Cheese I will impaire yee.
Kinde Mr. George, your Muse must be exalted,
My Poetry you very well haue salted.
Salt keepes thinges sweet, & make them rellish sauory
And you haue powdred well my honest kna &c.
I thanke you to, nor will I be ingratefull,
Whilest Rime or Reason deignes to fill my patefull,
You truely say that I loue Whores and Thieues well,
And halfe your speech I think the world belieues well,
For should I hate a Theefe, Theeues are so Common,
I well could neither loue my selfe or no man,
But for Whores loue, my purse would neuer hold out,
They'l heate and picke the Siluer and the Gold out.
You both haue grac'd my Thiefe, he bath confessed,
You (like two Shrieues) conuay'd him to be Pressed.
In mirth you write to me, on small Requesting,
For which I thanke you both, in harmlesse Iesting,
And may your Studies to such goodnes raise you,
That God may euer loue, and good men praise you.
