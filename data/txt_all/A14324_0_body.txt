MOst renowned Soueraigne, as before your Maiesties co∣ming to this Crowne, I did in your Realme of Scotland make apparant my vnfained loue to your Highnesse: so do I now on bended knees most humbly beseech your royall Maiestie to accept this little hand∣full of my hearts most faithfull affection; wherein my feeling of Gods mercies, my knowledge of your gracious goodnesse, and my care of my countries well-doing, hath made me take such paines. As if it may be pleasing in your sight, shall breed no little glory to my soule: who kneeling

at your royall feete, do beseech the God of all glorie to endue your Highnesse with his infinite blessings, and long to preserue your royall Maiestie in all ioyfull health, and prosperous life. Amen.
