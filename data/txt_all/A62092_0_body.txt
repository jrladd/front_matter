MADAM;
THe affixing so honourable a Name to the fol∣lowing Discourse, may be deemed by some Per∣sons, as a device to allure Customers, or to raise the Reader's expectation of some Novelty contained therein. But tho Dedications are often abused to so base, and many times to a more sordid end, yet they are of ancient use, and may be of great profit. And the design of this Sermon, being a perswasive to an abso∣lute resignation of our selves to the Will of God, and a quiet submission to his fatherly Corrections, acknow∣ledging all that he willeth or doth to be just and good, how sharp soever they may appear for the present; 'twas judged not unsuitable to your Ladyships conditi∣on, being now conflicting under a smart Providence.
In the ensuing Sermon, your Ladyship will find, what kind of Resignation it is that is required, and what an excellent and commendable thing it is, and the great Advantages we have thereby, breeding in us a contenta∣tion in every Condition, be we High or Low, Rich or Poor, Solitary or full of Company, in the injoyment of near and dear Relations, and our deprivation of them;
 causing us to sit loose from the Creature, or any comfort thereof, be it never so amiable, pleasant, or suitable to our desires; Curing our distrustful Fears, and carking Solici∣tudes; enabling us to go on chearfully in our Duty, with respect to this World, and the next; and to perform that Work which God hath given us to do, leaving the success to him who hath the soveraign disposal of all Persons and E∣vents. And as repugnancy to the Divine Will, is the ground of all that Impiety, and consequently of all those Mischiefs that so much molest and trouble the World. So compliance with, and submission to it, is the ground of all true Piety and Peace. The great Quarrel kept up between God and Man, being a Contest, who shall have their Will, whose Will shall stand, whose must stoop; God to Man, or Man to God. Now, where Wills are at variance, he that hath the greatest interest in the thing contested about, and that hath the most Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; that can undertake, that if his Will take place, there shall be a good issue of things; and if the others take place, there shall be a bad issue: There's all the reason in the World that his Will should stand, and the others submit: Now it's clearly so in this case, between God and Ʋs; and to help you in this Duty, is the design of the following Discourse.
Madam; Whatsoever God hath taken from you, he hath left you something better behind, he hath not taken away himself and Spirit, an Interest in Christ, and a Right to Heaven: And when he takes away any worldly Comfort, he will give something better in the room of it to them that truly fear him; and if what he deprives you of in Tem∣porals, he makes up in Spirituals, you will find a good ex∣change: which that you may, shall be the Prayer of,
Madam,
