Right Worshipfull,
IT was one of the statute-Lawes of the Jewish Theocracy, that, If a Master gave his servant a wife,Exod. 21.4. and she did bear him sons or daughters, the wife and her children should be her Masters. An Ecclesiasticall Benefice, is by some Authors called a wife: such a wife, endowed with a competent Portion, you were pleased freely and undeservedly to bestow upon me: and be∣tween us this tender Infant (this weak Tractate) is brought forth, which by the tenor and obligation of the former Law, belongs to you. Will you now be pleased to own it upon this consideration, and look upon it for its relative, though not for any reall inherent worth; and to let some drops of that love and kindness, which you have done, and do continually pour upon the head of its unworthy Author, fall down upon it. Let that pity, chari∣ty, and hospitality, which all sorts do so frequently
 experiment, be extended to this poor exposed birth. Besides, as you are Lord of the Mannour in which it was first conceived and born, so it owes ho∣mage to you, and I am confident is ready to pay suit and service to you, according to its utmost ca∣pacity and possibility. Will you be pleased but to make triall of its service, and see what; it can do for you, and hearken to its voice, as Naaman to the little maides, 2 Kings 5.2, 4, 5. And though 'tis true, you stand not in need of such a servant, yet it may stand in need of such a Master: and therefore it begs the favour of one of your retain∣ers, which I likewise crave in its behalf, that it may serve as a publike monument of my gratitude, and testifie to all that I am
Sir,
