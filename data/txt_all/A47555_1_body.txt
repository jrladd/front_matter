MY LORD,
AFTER five Years residence at Constantinople, in Service of the Embassie of the Earl of Winchelsea, (my ever honoured Lord) and this my second Journey from thence by Land into my own Country, I judged it a Point of my Duty, and of my Religi∣on too, to dedicate this following Treatise, as the Fruits of my Travels, Negotiations, and Leisure in those remote Parts, to the Noble Person of your Lordship; as that Votiva Tabula, which many both in Ancient and Modern Times, after some signal Deliverance, or happy Arrival at their desired Port, use to offer to their Gods, their Saints, or their Patrons. And truly, my Lord, this Discourse treating chiefly of the Turkish Polity, Govern∣ment, and Maxims of State, seems naturally to appertain to the Patronage of your Lordship, whose Faculties of Wisdom and Vertue have given you the Blessing of your Prince's Favour, and the Reputation, as well Abroad as at Home, of an Eminent and Dexterous Minister of State.
It were a great presumption in me to offer any Observations of my own in the Courts of Christian Princes, to the Test of your Lordship's Experience and Judgment; who not only is acquainted with the Customs and Manners, but penetrates into the Designs, and knows the Cabinet-Councils of Neighbouring Principalities, with whom our divided World may possibly be concerned; but perhaps, without disparagement to your Lordship's profound Wisdom, or over-value of my own Abilities, I may confidently draw a rude Scheme be∣fore your Lordship, of the Turkish Government, Policies, and Customs; a Sub∣ject which Travellers have rather represented to their Country-men, to supply them with Discourse and Admiration, than as a Matter worthy the Conside∣ration or Concernment of our Kings, or our Governors.
It hath been the happy Fortune of the Turk to be accounted Barbarous and Ignorant; for upon this Perswasion, Christian Princes have laid themselves open and unguarded, to their greatest Danger; contending together for one Palm of Land, whilst this Puissant Enemy hath made himself Master of whole Provinces, and largely shared in the rich and pleasant Possessions of Europe.
This Contempt of the Turk on one side, caused the Emperor to be so backward in opposing that Torrent of the Ottoman Force, which in the first Year of the late War broke in upon him; and the suspicion of Designs from France on the other, altered the Resolutions and Councils of the Emperor for prosecution of the War; which then running favourably on the Christians part, was no less than with the astonishment of the whole World, and of the Turks themselves, on a sudden understood to be clapt up with Articles of a disadvantagious Peace; admiring to see the Emperor give a stop to the Cur∣rent of his Victories, and relinquish the Game with a lucky Hand.
But this will seem no Riddle to those who penetrate Affairs with the same Judgment that your Lordship doth, and consider the unfirm Condition the House of Austria was in, by a daily expectation of the Death or fall of so main a Basis of it, as the King of Spain, and the Division amongst the Prin∣ces of the Empire; the League of the Rhine; the Freneh Practices to make the Duke of Enguyen King of Poland; and the extravagant Demands of the French and Rhinish League for Winter-quarters, and places of Strength, not only in Hungary, but also in Styria, and the adjacent Places, and at the same time look on the Factions in Hungary, and a considerable Army of French in the Bowels of Germany, who were supposed in those Parts to have rather come with Design to overawe the next Diet, and force the German Princes to elect the French King for King of the Romans, than with sincere and simple Inten∣tions of opposing themselves to the Enemy of the Faith: For then it will ap∣pear, that the best use the Emperor could make of his good Success, was Mo∣deration in Victory, and Reconciliation with his powerful Enemy. And hereupon Earl Lisle being dispatched for Extraordinary Ambassador from his Imperial Majesty to the Grand Signior; though the Turk was elevated with the thoughts of the Necessity the Christians had of a Peace, did yet so hap∣pily manage his Charge and Employment, as created in the Turks an extraor∣dinary Reverence towards his Person, and obtained such Honours and Treat∣ments from them, as the Turkish Court never bestowed before on the Empe∣ror's, or an other Christian Ambassador; extorting this Complement from the Great Vizier, That he was more satisfied the Emperor had sent so brave and illu∣strious a Person, than if he had sought to reconcile his Affections with an hundred thousand Dollars more of Present. And to do justice to this worthy Person, he hath brought a Reputation to the British Nation, above any in our Age, whose Vertues and Industry have acquired the highest Trusts and Preferments in Foreign Parts; and done the same Honour to his King, under whom he was born a Subject, as to the present Emperor and his Ancestors, under whom he is, and hath always been a faithful Minister; having deserved so eminently for saving the whole German Empire from the Treason of Wallestein, by hiw own single Act of Bravery, (a Story notoriously known to all the World) as can never in gratitude be forgot by that Nation, nor want its due Record and Place in the History of that Country.
The Speculation of what is contained in this following Discourse, may seem unworthy of your Lordship's precious Hours, in regard of that No∣tion of Barbarity with which this Empire is stiled; yet the knowledg hereof will be like a Turquoise, or some other Jewels set within the Rose of those many Gems of your Lordship's Wisdom and Vertues.
This Present, which I humbly consecrate to your Lordship, may be ter∣med Barbarous, as all things are which are differenced from us by diversity of Manners and Custom, and are not dressed in the Mode and Fashion of our Times and Countries; for we contract Prejudice from Ignorance and want of Familiarity. But your Lordship, who exactly ponderates the Weight of Humane Actions, acknowledges Reason in all its Habits, and draws not the Measures of Oeconomy, or Policy, from Eternal Appearances or Effects, but from the Fundamental and Original Constitutions; so that your Lorship will conclude, that a People, as the Turks are, Men of the same Composition with us, cannot be so Savage and Rude as they are generally described; for Ignorance and Grossness is the Effect of Poverty, not incident to happy Men, whose Spirits are elevated with Spoils and Trophies of so many Na∣tions.
Knowing (my Lord) that this Work which I have undertaken is liable to common Censure, I have chosen to shrowd my Name under the Patronage of your Lordship, to protect me from the ill-understanding and mis-concep∣tions of our Country-men, both at Home and Abroad: against which I doubt not but to be sufficiently armed in all parts where I travel, when the Counte∣nance your Lordship affords me, is joined to the Authority of his Excellency the Earl of Winchelsea, His Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary, now actu∣ally Resident at Constantinople, my ever honoured Lord; to whom I read, a long time before published to the World, the greatest part of this following Treatise; and as I received his favourable Approbation and Assent to the Ve∣rity of most Matters herein contained; so I must ingenuously confess to have been beholden to that quick and refin'd Genius of his, who often rectified my Mistakes, supplied me with Matter, and remembred me of many material Points, which I might otherwise have most unadvisedly omitted: And his Excellency knowing that in his absence this Book might want a favourable Pa∣tron, left me to my self to seek out one, who might concur with him in the same Innocent Defence. And as, my Lord, you are a Publick Person, and under our Gracious Sovereign, are one of those Generous Spirits which have espoused the common Interest of the Nation; so I presume, on this present Occasion, not to want your Protection also in a single Capacity: For which excess of Favours, I shall ever pray for the Exaltation of the greater Glory of your Lordship, and for ever acknowledg my self,
My Lord,
