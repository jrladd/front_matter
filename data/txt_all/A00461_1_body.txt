FOR all your sakes, and at many of your requests, I haue hereby aduentured to be wondred at, as a Saul among the Prophets, and engaged my selfe into what further obloquy a na∣tiue propension and inclination to your noble quality can cast vpon me.
Yet, I confesse, when I preached the Sermon, I only intended it one houres life, vnlesse the memory & meditati∣on of the hearers could haue repriued it longer: But when I saw the power of pale-fac'd Malice conspiring with most vnworthy basenesse, laboured to beget me more shame and lasting dis∣grace, than so momentary and transient an action could either conceale or re∣deeme; I was easily moued to make my good purposes as publique, as their vile and iniurious practises had bene noto∣rious, & as voulntarily to submit my selfe to the Arrest of all honest judge∣ments, as I was then forced to do, to their insulting & vnseasonable follies.
I walke thus in the cloudes, because I would haue the plaster no bigger than the sore; and therefore leauing them to their future repentance, I returne to you, whose hoped good and incou∣ragement from hence, is the point and terme to which this motion tends: If it there arriue, acknowledge the wis∣dome of him, that made meate come

out of the eater, and this sweet out of the sowre: And blame not me, though there be some things added, and many things altered: The liberty of the Pul∣pit is too litle, but that of the Presse, in our affaires, is much lesse: Besides that in all writings, somewhat must neces∣sarily be vnderstood, which the Eu∣phonia of the praesent times will not beare, if too accentiuely exprest▪ For man to man is a Tyrant, & Prustes like, cutteth of Gyants, and stretcheth out Pigmees to the measure of that bed, wherein his imagination lyeth.
If you haue felt this euill hand, nib∣bling at your quality and profession, thinke it not strange; your Generall hath called you to follow him in these and greater Conflicts: Onely let all things be done in faith, and let your faith be warranted by the priuy seale of a good Conscience, and the Letters Patents of Scripture, and then you shall see, how far vnable the breath of man is to shake that, against which the Gates of hell shall not preuaile.




But I will not anticipate my selfe, in giuing that counsell at the dore, which I can but repeat in the best roome of the house. I conclude; Chi pecora si fa, il lupo la mangia, Him that makes himselfe a sheepe, the wolfe deuoures, saith the prouerbe; But he that is praepared to saue himselfe and others, shall after he hath seene seuen contem∣ners take hold of his skirt for safety, rest  peace among the mighty men, among the valiant men which are fallen, which haue gone downe to the graue with their weapons of warre, and haue layed their swords vnder their heads.
Now enter, and take in good part, the poore, but hearty wellcome, and cheer∣full entertainment of
