SIR,
AS I have all my days lived in obscurity, and ever af∣fected quietnesse from the world, rather then ac∣quaintance with it, (estee∣ming that of the Poet, Bene qui latuit bene vixit, above a Sibyl∣line Oracle) so it is my desire to passe out of it with as little noyse and notice as I can.
But being incited by reading the Lives of some Fathers, and other modern Wor∣thies, lately published, to draw a small de∣lineation of the fruitfull Life and Death of that late Magazin of Learning and Pie∣ty, M. SAMƲEL CROOK, my most Reverend and dear late Friend and Brother, heretofore well known to you in
the prime of his spring in Emmanuell Col∣lege) to whose eminency and memory not onely my self, but all that knew him, intus & in cute, owe a larger tribute, then I can hope to pay; and of whom, I may sadly and seriously professe, as one of another excellent man, Piget me vivere post tantum virum, cujus magna doctrina fuit, sed exi∣guasi cum pietate conferatur;) I must herein Hac saltem prodire tenus, to set forth this Authologie to open view for publick be∣nefit.
Which being so, I apprehend as an hap∣pinesse this opportunity to manifest to the world some part of those just and honoura∣ble respects which I ever bare to your Worth, Name, and Family, by commen∣ding this Relique of such a Dead-living Saint unto you, who are very well able to make the best choyce of the fairest Copies of Piety and Holinesse, and to write ex∣actly after them.
This performed I retire to my wonted Ʋmbraculum, where I solace my self, to have been not onely so well known unto you from your first undertaking for me at my Baptism, but under the benign aspect of your care and countenance ever since that compaternall susception: for which, I resolve my self altogether Yours, to ho∣nour and serve you, as becomes
From my stu∣dy, May 20, 1650.
SIR,
