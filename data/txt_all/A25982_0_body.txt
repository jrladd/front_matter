My Lord,
I Have presumed to affix your Lordships name to these few leaves, not that I desire a Patrocinie for any thing in them, but truth, Quae premetur sed non opprimetur. Had Dr. Hamonds Vindication been a mirror to reflect mine own ignorance upon me, and had I had thereby so much light, as to see my self in the dark, I had quietly acquiessed, and sate down under the Majesty and Authority of Truth: But (my Lord) I finde it far otherwise; not to charge this Doctors Abilities, I am more then most suspitious (if that could be) of his candidness, who is not onely satisfied in wounding the name of E. P. but takes thereby opportunity to vent his virulency against the present Powers: Your Lord∣ship, and your Coassertors of publike Freedom, and of the Liberty of the Gospel of Jesus Christ may lie for a time under the staines of vile mens Tongues and

Pens, yet your Integrity and Resolutions to the hazard of your All, will (I hope) one day receive the mark of Well-done by him, who makes a narrower exploration then meerly into the Exterior actions of men: My Lord, The Government of a Kingdom, is Prudentibus grave sed fatuis gratum, the one loves it, because he is filled with ima∣gination onely of its sweet and beauty; and the other fears it, because he knows its weight and burden; I may not but conjecture that many hate the present Powers, some because they will, others because they have not a share in the exercise of it, so that on all hands you have enemies. The Lord direct you, and those now in Power with you, in the Execution of the great Trust that lies upon you. That you may not onely have the mark of an Honorable and Pathless act of Justice upon your Names, but that it may smell sweet in the Nostrils of God, and be pretious in the esteem of them that fear him: This shall be the Prayer of
12. May. 1650.
My Lord,
