SIR, the Authour of
this Booke, willing
to shrowde his vn∣perfect
worke, vn∣der
the couert of
some suche well minded Gentle∣man,
that might defend it from the
greedy gripe of such bolde-faced
bussards, as commonly vse to prey
vpon the workes of yong wits: and
of himselfe altogether vnprouided
for that purpose, hath entreated
mee to make some meanes for his
helpe herein: at whose instant re∣quest,
I haue presumed to commit

to your selfe, this vnperfect worke:
which, please it you but to accept,
in part of payment, for that debt of
duetie, wherein I stand bound vn∣to
you: it shal incourage me when
his idle houres shall better furnish
some more substantiall subiect, to
pleasure you with that: who now
am bolde to presume vppon your
patience with this. I cease: being, I
am that I am, and while lliue,
wil liue, to loue
you.
