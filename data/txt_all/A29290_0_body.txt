My Lord,
WEre an Author, who Dedi∣cates a Book, obliged to Choose a Subject equal to the

Merit of the Person to whom he Addresses It; I should appear Guilty of an inexcusable Fault, in presenting You This, which contains Noihing worthy the Perusal of a Wit so Delicate, and so Clear, as Your Lord∣ship's. And the Impa∣tience I was under, to make You an Offering out of my poor Stock, must have submitted to the Censure and Con∣demnation

of a Crime. But, my Lord, the Me∣rit of Persons of Your Rank is not measured by Books: Those who are Born under the Influ∣ence of Stars so happy as Yours, Read not to Learn; and seldome find Books Capable to Instruct Them. I, who am only an Author of Trifles, can pretend to no more than the Ho∣nour of giving You a

little Divertisement. My Book may pass for ano∣ther Scaramouche; The Hero of my Play having Acted (especially when London was his Scene) a very pleasant Part, which many have thought wor∣thy the Publishing in Print: I might have, perhaps, succeeded bet∣ter in my Description, had I been allow'd the Liberty to Represent it fully as it was: But

there were too many concerned; who, though they bore part in the Adventures of my He∣ro, would doubtless have been loath to appear in his Memoires. There was a necessity to suppress many Particulars; and what is supprest, is of∣ten the best part of the Story: I have said this rather to excuse my self to Your Lordship, than to Justifie my self to the

Publick. I could have wish'd, that though the Present I offer be really a Trifle, yet that my Trifle should not have been Imperfect; but it was not in my Power; and an Historian must not alwayes Write the whole Truth of his Sto∣ry.
Thus far, my Lord, this Epistle hath nothing common with ordinary.

Dedications; which are usually made up of Elo∣ges, as well true as false: Yet, I confess, that an Author as I am, who pretend much to Since∣rity, ought not to have let slip so fair an Occa∣sion (without the help of Art or Eloquence) to Represent in Your Lordship's Person, the Wit, the Courage, and all other Qualityes of a

Hero High-born, and every way Compleat: But this is a Subject too Excellent, to appear in the Front of a Book of this Nature. I will re∣serve my self that Ho∣nour for a better Occa∣sion, in some serious Peice; and rest satisfyed at present, to have Writ∣ten an Epistle for no o∣ther end, than to make it appear, With how

much Respect, and how deep a Passion, I am,
My Lord,
