Worthy Sir,
AS I had the honour to wait up∣you in your Travels to Rome, so I had the oppotunity of making some Remarks in our way thi∣ther, and from thence to Naples; where the Antiquities are not less curious than what you saw in Rome it self; which I here humbly present

you with a review of in a piece of prospective: Which, though it be done by an ill hand, yet it may help to Commemorate to you most of the Re∣markable Things you took notice of when you was there. I had not room in this small Tract to mention any thing of Politicks, or Constitution of Governments in any of these Princes Courts or Republicks that we passed through, having no design at present but to point out to you the way you Travelled, and the Distance from Place to Place, with Observations made of the Antiquities of Rome, Naples, and other Places; together with the Strength, Beauty and Sci∣tuation of some other Towns and Forts in Italy; the best Painting, Carving, and Limning, and some other both Na∣tural and Artificial Curiosities, which you your self took such particular No∣tice of, that they cannot but remain still fresh in your Memory: However I have made bold to present you with this Poor Assistance, which may

serve instead of a Lame Antiquary, if peradventure you should meet with any private Inducement, or Obligati∣on of Publick Trust, to carry you again into those Parts. Sir, you will meet with neither Polishing nor Trim∣ming in it, but the same Plain Dress it had on when you saw it first, which I humbly beg of you to take a review of, and to give me the Assistance of your Memory whereinsoever you shall find me deficient; And in so doing you will add to your Former Obliga∣tions a Remarkable Favour never to to be forgot by,
Sir,
