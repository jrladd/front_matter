Brethren,
YOu may remember I was engaged to your reverend Pastor for an exchange upon necessary occasions: these conclusions I then delivered for sub∣stance to you, & I know not a materiall word varied. You know how it was calum∣nized, and with what bit∣ternesse
interpreted by him who heard it not, upon what grounds hee proceeded, I leave it to his owne serious thoughts. As they are and were I commend them to you, to judge whether the things are censurable or no. I must acknowledge your patience and candid acceptance of them then, and engage my selfe now and ever,

Rochester, Novemb. 20. 1646.
