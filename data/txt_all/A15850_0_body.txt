RIght Worshipfull, calling to minde my owne follies (euer from mine Infancy, prone to haue coniunction with in∣temperancie the chiefe foun∣taine of all mens perturbati∣ons, and also remembring your good counsell euer giuen vnto me, that I should loath excesse, & loue temperance (which I now finde of it selfe to be the treasure of vertue,) compelling men to follow Reason, bringing peace to the minde, and mollifying the affections with concord and agreement, receiuing I say from you, not onely good aduice (being as great a benefit as one friend can doe to another) but also good example which is the readyest path-way to guide men to felicitie, and for feare I should bee culpable according to the prouerbe; Thankes waxeth old as soone as gifts are had in possession I thought good although I cannot requite, yet to make knowne to your Worship, that I do not forget (for omnium in∣gratissimus
est,
Ingratus qui be∣neficium accepisse negat, quod acce∣pit: Ingratus qui d dissimulat, vursum Ingratus qui non reddit: et omnium In∣gratissimus qui oblitus est. qui oblitus est: neither this: nor other your manifold great & continuall kindnes bestowed vpon me: And that you may see how good a schol∣ler I haue proued in the arte of sobrietie by your discipline consiliatorie and exemplarie. I am im∣boldened to craue your patronage to this pamphlet which will at large set downe all the subtle sleights, tempting baites, and craftie allurements, which Sa∣tan vseth for the ouerthrow of mankinde, by this vice of drunkennes, (which indeede is the Metropo∣litane citie of all the prouince of vices) which Rea∣son made me intitle my Booke, Englands Bane: be∣cause no Nation is more polluted with this capitoll sinne, then ours. And I protest it is not ambition that made me craue the patronage to this Treatise: (considering my small deseruings) but chiefely pre∣suming vpon the affiance of your good nature and kinde constructions of my weake endeauours, and something the rather, because I know your liberall qualities inclinable to the Rule of my intentions: which is not to barre Societie, but to condemne Ebrietie;
Eccles. 31.23. Pro. 22.9. For Salomon saith, He that is liberall shall bee blest, and honoured of his neighbours: And of this ver∣tue, I know both your selfe and all your Worship∣full Family: fully indued; for often haue I heard you say, that of the Wine and Beere you regarded not the expence: but you blamed such as would abuse these creatures to ouerthrowe their owne sence, and such voluptuous liuers are them I chiefely ayme at, that cannot take moderation to bee their guide: Omne nocet nimium, mediocriter omne geren∣dum, I know you loue to Reade: because you
know to censure? Let mee therefore intreat your Worship to reade this, and to giue it fauourable protection to the world: although the lines be rude, the matters good, and it is no shame to gather a Primrose growing among Briers, had it better you should enioy it, such as it is if you entertaine I shall rest.
