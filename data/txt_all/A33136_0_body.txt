GREAT SIR,
IF the Reading of History in General, be not only a Re∣creation, but a Restorative, and such, as by which some Princes have recover'd the Health of their Bodies, others the Distempers of their Mind, many have learn'd to settle, and most to preserve the Weal of their Estates; meet∣ing
 therein with divers Occurrences, which (as De∣metrius Phalaris once hinted to the first Ptolomey of Aegypt) none of their Friends or Followers would, or perhaps durst mind them of, then certainly the Records of those stupendious Works perform'd in almost all Ages, by those DIIFORMES your Great Progenitors (ma∣ny of whose Words were taken as Oracles, their A∣ctions as Examples, and their Examples as Laws) cannot but be a Subject worthy your Royal Regard: and possibly not less pleasant then useful, whilst in comparing Glory, it will appear how happy you are made by their Vertues, how much happier by your own, in which theirs, drawn by various Lines, seem to concenter, or rather are represented to Admiration; not unlike those Pictures of some Illustrious Personages, which containing divers Figures, do one way shew the Faces of sundry of their Ancestors, but another way that of their own only, in the Circmference whereof all the former are very plainly comprehended.
In this Confidence I have taken a Patern of Duty from the Ancients, whose Custom it was, Adi Ce∣sarem per Libellum, presuming the more upon your Majesties gracious Acceptation of the Work; in that it was design'd to be a Monument of my own Grati∣tude, as of your Greatness, and the only Instance of Duty I could give at that which was indeed the worst of Times; being begun when every Body thought that Monarchy had ended, and would have been buried in the same Grave with your Martyr'd Father: when those Paricides who glory'd in having banish'd you like Tarquinius (for so they blasphemously call'd you, though they could not add Superbus) resolv'd to Ex∣tirpate all Goodness as well as all Good Men; when none of Ʋs that had serv'd that Blessed Prince, had
 any other Weapon left us but our Pens to shew the Justice of our Zeal, by that of his Title; when for want of Ink black enough to Record the Impieties that follow'd, we design'd to write them in Blood: Writing and Fighting being alike dangerous, and ne∣cessary. When lastly, we had no good Omen but what seem'd the worst of all, to see your Majesty like the good Emperor Mauritius heretofore (who is said to have been carried up and down, in his Swadling∣bands, by an Empusa, or Familiar Spirit, but with∣out taking any hurt) hurried from one Country to a∣nother, in the Infancy of your Power, by a Devil in no measure so Innocent as that, who though he was a∣ble to do you no more hurt, intended questionless the same Violence to your Sacred Person, as was offer'd to that of your Fathers, had not your Tutelar Angels, like those which are said to have preserv'd Lot from the Sodomites, shut the Door of Government upon him, and baffled his Ambition by the Revolt of those whom himself first taught to Rebell: the blasting of whose Grandeur, as it was a happy Presage of the Establishment of yours (whose Empire, after you lost your Country, was preserv'd intire in the Hearts of your People) so it rais'd our Faith to the Expectation of those happy dayes, which (bless'd be God) we have since seen; wherein your Majesty ha∣ving by your Clemency charm'd our Fears, as by your Power commanded our Obedience, and by your Justice secured our Affections, we now stand bound with a threefold Cord of Allegiance, that cannot easily be broken, it being no less impossible for your Dominions to cease, then our Desires to serve you; and since 'tis known you are as well Intitled to your Fathers Vertues, as his Kingdoms, what have we
 more to wish, but that you may prove as like the Se∣cond, as he was to the first Caesar, Et ut Nomine SECUNDUS, sic Majestate AUGUS∣TUS: So prayes,
Great SIR,
