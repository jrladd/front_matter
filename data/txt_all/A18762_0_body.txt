IN calling to minde right honourable, the continuance of your fauour and amiable countenance to∣wards me: I found my selfe indetted and vnable (but by affection or good will) to deserue the least part of your curtesies, yet looking on your manie yeares spent in learning and knowledge (for the which vertue, God hath called you to an honourable place) I thought by some studie (albeit my iudgement weake) to lead on your good liking so farre into my labors, that you shold not only affect my writings: but also accept the poor present I offer. which although they be but papers stuffed full of verses, yet the plaiines of the matter and good mea∣ning of the writer I hope shall purchase some small season (as a passing of the time) to make you beholde the willing paines I bestow. This first presumption penneth out the Epitaphs of 2. good Kings that gouerned this land of late, and sheweth by Epitaphs 3. other most honorable Coun∣sellers that dyed not long agoe: vnto the which 5. great personages I was bound for benefits receiued, and so in the end of my dayes (which cannot be long) to be thankful for good turnes and discharging of dutie, I haue set foorth by

the passage of those that are gone before, showes heer is no certain habitatiō or sure dwellīg place for thos that are left hinde, placed heer below (a little while) to look for a better world aboue. The Tragedies in my next book called my Challenge) shal make manifest at the full the effect of those passages: of which Tragedyes you shall haue a sufficient portion, that therby the world shall see what wrong I haue suffred to endure a deniall (by busie tunges) of mine owne workes: Shores wife shall speake in her kinde, to defend me and such as waites on her (because her good fortunes were worthy waiting on) shall tell the world I haue beene abused, and not iustly and rightly vnderstood: and in gods good giftes for his glories sake, my book of Chalenge shal chalenge all honest labours that euer I did in my daies, deny them who please. Now these bare verses and barren Epitaphes bringing no better frute but the death of some one or other, makes euery line vnwelcome that showes no cheerfull newes: but time that discouers all accidents (and death in his fury) brings pardon by the trueth that is found and such as in seasonable time do truly vtter that becomes them, are halfe excused though their boldnes be great: So neither fearing the open barker that makes a great bruite, nor the priuie byter that makes a great woūd, to the mild∣nes of your sweet censure I offer these plaine Epitaphs that follow, partly to make you beleeue I am mindfull of my promise, and cheefely for that I know my L. Chancellers death was sorowfull vnto you, so knoweth God who en∣crease your honorable credite.
