VVHoever with an Impartial Eye, shall behold the Constitution of the English Monarchy, must acknowledge it the best Establish'd Govern∣ment in the World; and whose Parlia∣ments are, (and have been) the Glory of their Prince, the Bulwark of the People, and the Terrour of their Enemies; and whenever there was that happy Union be∣tween King and Parliament which we have now the Blessing to Enjoy, it hath begot an Excellent Harmony; and Great and Glorious Actions have been perform'd by our Ancestors, to their Immortal Fame;

who have often made the Gallick Shore to Tremble: And I apprehend there hath nothing been wanting in the Subject, that the same things have not been again effect∣ed; but the Defect hath been in those Mea∣sures that have been taken.
Therefore I do humbly present these en∣suing Propositions (in the same Form they were deliver'd to the Lords of the Admi∣ralty) in which may be seen (as in a Glass) the Source from whence our Evils have sprung: And with all due submission do humbly conceive, that the whole matter carries so much of Reason along with it, that I think its unanswerable. Not that I have any Opinion I have manag'd the Ar∣gument so well; but there are some Truths that may be easily evidenced, and which require not those exquisite Parts which are necessary in more abstruse Matters, and may be perform'd by a Man of but indif∣ferent Education.

Trade is altogether of as great Conse∣quence and Importance to this Nation, as the Nerves and Sinews are to the Body of Man; which being Cut, is debilitated and weaken'd: So if our Trade be ruin'd we shall be Impoverish'd, and become a Prey to our Enemies. But I fear my Zeal will transport me beyond my Bounds; for I plainly see, that the Happiness of Europe, and the very Existence and Well-being of the Protestant Religion, and Welfare of these Kingdoms, depend upon the Success of this War.
And God hath given us Strength and Ability, whereby we may be able to Cope with our Enemies, and Reduce them to Reason.
But hitherto we have not taken such proper Measures in our Naval Preparations as we ought, which (I humbly conceive) hath been the Genuine Cause and Founda∣tion of all our Misfortunes and Losses at

Sea during this War; and which hath greatly impair'd their Majesties Revenue, and the Trade of the Nation.
There can no Revolution happen in any Kingdom, be it never so Just, but there will be some Malecontents; and the nearer Ruin their Cause is, so much the more will they struggle in it, (being like the Convulsions of a dying Man) and use all Arts, and turn themselves into all shapes, so they may but possibly disorder the publick Proceedings of the Kingdom.
And now are the Eyes of this Nation, and all Europe, upon this August Assembly, waiting the Issue of the Debates thereof, which being Vigorous and Early (Mony being the Sinews of War) will beget the like Vigour and Resolution in the Allies, and prevent the French King from making any separate Peace, which (by his Emissa∣ries) he hath with so much Industry endea∣vour'd, as knowing he must sink under the wait of the Confederate Arms.

But it astonishes me, when I consider that two Nations, who are so Potent at Sea as we and the Dutch are, should not make a more advantagious use of that strength which God hath given us: The being strongest at Sea, was ever an unspeakable advantage; which is apparent to the whole World that we are, notwithstanding those Losses we have had.
And we may plainly see that the Pro∣vidence of God generally works and brings things to pass by Natural Causes and Ef∣fects, as may evidently be seen by the late Revolution in this Kingdom; for it was by the Evil Administration of Government, under various Circumstances of Affairs, that contributed to it, and which gave just ground and occasion for it; and was that which turn'd the Hearts of the People, and thereby begat a Union of Parties, and was the great outward Cause of our present Settlement.

Therefore in vain will it be for us to cry unto God for Help, and to give a Bles∣sing to our Endeavours, when we take not apt and proper Measures.
And it seems highly unreasonable his Ma∣jesty should be so much expos'd to the Vi∣olence of the Enemy, to the great hazard of his Royal Person; upon whose Safety depends not only the happiness of these King∣doms, but all Europe; and he hath hitherto been obliged to attend the Motions of the Enemy, and to take his Measures according as they move; which brought his Person into Imminent danger.
Therefore with all due Submission I hum∣bly conceive, that notwithstanding all the utmost Efforts that can be made, its moral∣ly impossible of making any Impression up∣on the French in Flanders, they being so strong on that side, but by making a Des∣cent upon their Maritime Coast, if not to Conquer, yet to commit the same Depre∣dations

they have done upon our Neigh∣bouring Nations; that they may Drink, and have their share of the Cup of Afflicti∣on, and feel the dismal Effects of War: Nothing can possibly wound the Enemy like it, if it be carried on by a Conjunction of some of the Forces of the Confederates, and back'd by a strong Fleet.
Then would it soon alter the Scene, and distract the Councils, and break the Mea∣sures of the Enemy; as not knowing where the Storm will fall; which will consequently oblige them to make a Defensive War in all Parts; and would England but Exert its Strength, I doubt not but it would soon pull down the Pride and Haughty Look of that Aspiring Monarch, whose Insatiable Ambition is such, that he hath made Eu∣rope a Golgotha, a Field of Blood.
And there's nothing like pushing on the War with Vigour; a Lingering Con∣sumption being worse than Death.

least, render'd all Attempts of this Nature more difficult.
And it was ever the Genius and Temper of the English, (as do witness their Wars both Foreign and Domestick) to push on a War, and come to Action, leaving the Event to Providence.
And whereas the Number of Loose and Vagrant Persons are exceedingly increas'd in the Kingdom through the Laws not be∣ing duly put in Execution, and the King having ever had a Power of taking these up by Warrants from the Justices of the Peace to be sent on Board the Royal Navy.
Therefore I humbly conceive, it would much Contribute to the Publick Service, that his Majesty may have the same Liberty (by Act of Parliament) of taking them up by the same Methods, and Employ them as he shall think fit, either in mixing them with the Regular Troops, or otherwise;

which would be the Raising of several Thousands of stout and able Men, fit for Service, who are now but Drones, and as it were the Vermin of the Land; but by these means may be made Serviceable to the Publick; and a great Kindness it will be to all Parts of the Kingdom. I am
My Lords and Gentlemen,
