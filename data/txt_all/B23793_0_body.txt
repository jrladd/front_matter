Reverend Sirs,
REspecting the Product of this Presumption, as I am not capable of the Foresight, so I am not concern'd at the Effect▪ My honest and innocent Intendment (I trust) shall compose my Mind to a sedate Tranquility, under all the Censures that shall be cast upon me. My Design in what I have written being to advance an universal good, was not Penn'd to please the Ear, but to feed the Understanding, and commode the Soul. Wherefore, however unpolish'd it may appear to your more curious Eyes, yet my Cha∣rity obligeth me to hope, that Defects of this Nature, will pas∣without Rebuke, under the Co∣vert of your Candour and Inge∣nuity. The Motive that indu∣ed this Dedication, was the Ho∣nourable Esteem I had of you as great Masters of Reason and Re∣ligion, and thence expected both
Favour and ustice at your Hands, according to the Demerit of the Case: as also to silence some, who otherwise might vent their Ignorance, and Envy at too Profuse a Rate. Likewise I was not without hopes that hereby, my poor endeavours, might have the greater Success in obtaining their designed End, (i. e. God's Glo∣ry in Man's Salvation.) And I hope you will not be wanting to do what in you lies, to remove e∣very Matterial Errour and Mi∣stake which you apprehend in these Lines, or any other which with them may be presented un∣to your View. I conclude with my humble Request, that this Poor Pilgrim, may be receiv'd into your Houses, and accosted with that Entertainment the Sacred Oracle directs you to give to every Stranger, how know you but it may prove an Angel of the Lord. The God of all Goodness, increase and perpetu∣ate your Happiness here, and Crown you with Immortal Joys hereafter. So Prays, &c.
