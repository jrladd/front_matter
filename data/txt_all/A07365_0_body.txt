Madame.
WHat at first priuately was entended for you, is at last pub∣lickely commended to you. This poore play-worke of mine, had its prime originall and birth-wrights in your own house, when by nearer seruice I was obliged yours. I am humbly-bould to present it to your Ladiships view and protection (if you will daigne to make happy by your Patronage so meane a worke) both for your well knowne loue to the Science, and your many many fa∣uours conferred vpon my vndeseruing selfe, the louer and admirer of your Vertues. The powrefull perswasi∣on of that nobly-disposed Gentlewoman Mrs. Dorothy Thynne, your vertuous Daughter, whose breast is possest with an admirable hereditary loue of Musicke, and who once laboured mee to that effect, hath not a little emboldned mee herevnto. If there liue any good thing in mee, onely your Onely-Selfe is firstly inte∣ressed in the same, I being doubly bound, by your bountie on the one side, and my dutie on the other. Accept then, Gracious Lady, with vnwrinkled brow, the affectionate, though weake deuoyre of him that strongly desires to doe you seruice. I know it is not able Eagle-like to looke with an vndaunted eye against the brightfull Sunne of your matchlesse iudgement; wherein notwithstanding, if your Clemencie shall allowe it ¦uourable roome, I feare not the vnequallest front of the sowrest Criticke.
Thus lowly-laying both it and my selfe, the worthlesse Authour at your VVorships seruice, I beseech Him that is the Giuer of all things, to graunt vnto you, and your vertuous Daughters, a full confluence of vnited Happinesse heere, and glory eternall hereafter.
