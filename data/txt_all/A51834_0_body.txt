SIR,
I Have at length sent you the Copy of the Sermon, Preached at your Wives Funerals; dispose of it as you shall think good, either to your Closet or the Press: My Judgment is for the for∣mer, but my Affection will not suffer me to oppose, if you resolve upon the latter: If it may be any allay of your sorrow for your great loss, or of any use to the Publick, I shall not repent of the Transcription of it. This I may say with modesty enough, That the Subject is useful and proper to the occa∣sion. At the Interment of my godly friend,

who had so long waited on my Ministry with savor and profit; what could I insist upon more seasonably, for your comfort and mine own, then the Blessedness of those that live and die in the Lord? Now the Blessing of the Lord go along with this Discourse, whatever becometh of it; and make up this great breach to you, with the more abundance of Spiritual Refreshings. Which is the unfeigned desire of.
Sir,
