Gentlemen,
THAT Glorious Work which you have the Honour to be imployed in; hath afforded abundant Matter for your Great and Noble Attempts; and also a very large and pleasing Subject for the many Excellent Discour∣ses that have been Preach'd and Publish'd to instruct and quicken you therein.
But this Field (how fruitful soever it was) hath been reapt down by so many more Skilful Labourers, that I have been left, with the Moabitish Damsel, only to glean among their Sheaves; but hope for the Charity of Boaz, that if I gather some handfuls they have let fall, I shall not be reproach'd.
But I will not make any further Apologies (how needful soever they may be) for my defects in this Performance; for it is enough, that what I have done was in compliance with your Desires, whom I esteem very highly for your Works sake; and in Obedience to their united Requests, to whose Spirits mine ought to be subject: and that by overcoming the Reluctancy I had to expose my Weakness in this manner; I give the great∣er Testimony of my fervent, if not prudent, Zeal for the Work you are engaged in.
A Work that was the Desire of former Ages, is the Glory of this; and may leave a Blessing for those to come: which the Covenant of God, the God of your Fathers, doth oblige you to be active in: which hath derived many Signal Blessings upon us already. And that it is the great Duty and Honour of the Zealous Inhabitants of our Jerusalem; and how far it may determine our future Condition; and that our Hopes and Fears depend upon the Success of it, I have endeavoured to show, in the following Discourse.

You are encouraged, by the Presence and Promises of God, whose Cause it is, and who hath blest you with wonderful Success: And also by the excellent Zeal of his Vicegerent, our great Josiah, who hath given Life and Vigour to it: May he be also as David (as he resembles him in many other things) to prepare abundant Materials, to build a most Glo∣rious and lasting Temple for Generations to come. Nay, may he be a∣nother Zerubbabel, not only to lay the Foundation, but also to hold the Plummet in his hand till he hath finished it, and brought forth the head Stone thereof. And may he be as Successful to vanquish the Devil's Kingdom at home, by a more Glorious Conquest; as he hath been to re∣duce his Enemies abroad to an Honourable Peace. You, and such as you, are his Worthies and Armies, upon whom he must rely in this War∣fare against the Powers of Darkness.
Our Elders also have strengthened your Hands, by their ready Com∣pliance, to Enact many good and necessary Laws that you are to assist in the Execution of: Our Governours and Judges, our Magistrates and ma∣ny considerable Persons, both in Church and State, do give their help and countenance to it. So that many great Names of Majesty and Honour, Excellency and Justice; Grace and Authority, are all on your side: and many more of all ranks and sorts of Persons, do now approve your gene∣rous Designs, and are daily coming over to you. And shall not all this ex∣cite your Zeal, quicken your Diligence, and encourage your Perseve∣rance; and reproach them that are yet backward to joyn with you, and assist in such an Honourable, and Successful Ʋndertaking.
And it's no small Encouragement, that so many of different Perswasions in other matters, do so heartily conspire together to carry on this happy Work, wherein we are all agreed; who do also provoke one another to a generous Emulation of promoting the great Designs of our common Pro∣fession: not to a spiteful Envy, that hath been the Curse and Character of the unhappy times that are past: and may they be for ever past. And may the Blessed God continue to protect and honour your Persons, direct all your Counsels, and prosper your Zealous Endeavours in this, and eve∣ry good Work: and may he cause the Dawnings of this Blessed Day to shine more and more, till all the promiser Mercies to his Church and People in this World have their Accomplishment; and bring us to that perfect State where there shall be no need of a Reformation: These are, and shall be, the earnest Prayers of
