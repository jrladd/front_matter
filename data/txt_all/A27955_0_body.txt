SIR,
TO prefix your Name to a piece of so little worth, may argue somewhat of presumption; but to be intirely wanting in those respects, so much your due, is a more considerable fault.
It was not without relu∣ctance, that I consented to put this little Treatise under your safe-guard: Not that I
 question'd the influence of your Name; but least the slender value of the thing should lead a contempt from you to the Author.
But then I consider'd, that although you would certain∣ly discover the meanness of this attempt, yet you were endued with a sufficient share of goodness, not to miscon∣ceive the honest end; The first opposed my growing in∣clination to make you the Pa∣tron hereof: the last advised me to go on, as being incon∣sistent with censure, or dis∣pleasure.
You are ingaged, Sir, in an especial manner to the
 Office of pardoning, as well upon the account of your di∣stance from our inferiour Orb, as in regard to the fair endowments of your mind: both implying good∣ness in a conspicuous de∣gree.
As to my Author, I durst venture to assert, that he has manag'd himself like a man of Honesty and Parts, that his arguments are as material and persuasive as the Subject will bear, and if any thing renders him of less value, 'tis the ill performance of the Translation, which, I believe, is made worse by the mistakes of the Printer.

I can easily foresee, that it will be condemned by the li∣centious part of the world, but since the wiser men must infallibly commend the de∣sign; I am little concerned at what the Fop shall declare against it.
It has been always matter of great wonder to me, that men should be for generally  gracefull  Ba∣ implying Contumely and Disorder.
But, Sir, least I should be prolix, give the leave to as∣sure
 you, that this little Book is presented to you with all imaginable respect by,
Sir,
