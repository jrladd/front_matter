GOdly, and christian gen∣tlewomen, whom I loue in the truth,2. Ioh. 1. I hope I may speake of you as did that worthy Apostle of the elect la∣dy, who by the fruits of her piety and godlines, manifested her electi∣on: so you by the loue you beare tow∣ards God, his ordinances, and ser∣uants, doe declare euidently,1. Ioh. 3.14 your
 translation from death to life, and by your vertuous and holie liues, you demonstrate freedome from sin, which are of euerlasting life. I haue made bolde (Christian Gentlewo∣men) to patronize this small worke vnder your fauours, in token of thankefulnes, for your many fauours I haue receiued from you; not doubt∣ing but small things of this nature, will bee much respected, and wil∣lingly receiued; both in respect of your owne priuate gaine, as also the profit & benefit, which the whole Church of God may reap & gather frō it. Now if you, or the rest of the body of Christ shall receiue any bene∣fit by it, for the furthering of that
 worke of repentanee, and sanctifica∣tion of life, giue God the glory and praise.
And so J humbly take my leaue, commending you to the prouidence of God, and the word of his grace,Act. 20.32. which is able to build further, and to giue you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
Steane this 20. of Aprill 1612.
