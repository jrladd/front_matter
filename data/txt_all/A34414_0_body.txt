Right Honourable,
WAs I not fully perswaded of that Christ∣like spirit, re∣siding in your bosome, which was supereminent in your thrice honoured deceased Father, and now remaining in the Right Honourable your Lady mother, to acccept
of small things, from service reallized, presen∣ted. I durst not have presumed, to have pre∣fixed your noble name to so worthlesse a piece, much lesse have craved acceptation of it. But that candor and sweet∣nesse hath, as, embold∣ned mee to pray ac∣ceptance, so, encouraged me to beg patronage, of the poore and first la∣bours of your humble servant.
This, my selfe, and all I doe enjoy, though it were tenne thousand
times more, could not in the least measure, if sub∣jected to your com∣mands, bee a sufficient testimony of my thank∣fulnesse, for the least of those many high favors, by which I am obliged to your noble Family.
Should I goe to parti∣cularize, I might be vo∣luminous, and that being done, yet not be satis∣factory, either in respects to worths, or my own affections, which would ever be putting me on to doe more and better.
But not to trouble
your Lordship any lon∣ger; what I have, or may be wanting in tenders of service, shall be faithfully improved at the Throne of Grace for your eter∣nall happinesse.
Thus supplicating for pardon of boldnesse, and passing by of failings. As it was my honour to bee servant and Chyrurgion to your Noble Parents, so I humbly petition to subscribe my selfe, Your Honours,
