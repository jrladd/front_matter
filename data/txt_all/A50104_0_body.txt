SIRS,
WHen I was first desir'd, by some of you, to publish this Discourse, I took it but for a customary Complement of respect, to which I intended to make no farther an∣swer,
than my thankful acknowledg∣ment; but the same request being since reinforc'd by some others, who might plead, that Friendship which the Ser∣mon recommends, I was obliged to com∣ply; many Argments occurr'd to diswade we, bt I thoght of this one for my encouragement, that in crossing my own humour so much to gratifie my Friends, I should give one instance of practising what I Preach'd, and perchance gain the reputation of being one who would on all good occasions approve himself
