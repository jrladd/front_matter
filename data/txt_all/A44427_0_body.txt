THE following Ver∣ses, ought in Ju∣stice to be Yours, since, not only the best part of them were made at Your House, but they were made designedly for

You, so that this is not a De∣dication writ to a Book, but a Book writ to a Dedica∣tion; which, however, is the nicest part a Writer has to manage; for the most deserving Men, are the most averse to be told so, and what would please all their Friends and Acquin∣tance, wou'd displease them∣selves; which makes the Poet at a loss, whether to dissatisfie one, or many; his Readers, or his Patron.
But since I have alrea∣dy found it easier to You, to oblige, than to receive thanks for an Obligation, to do no violence to Your Modesty, I must do one to my own Justice, and desist from a Theme, which I could so willingly inlarge upon, but You so unwil∣lingly read.
I shall say little of the following Essays, either of the Originals I Translated

them from, or the Tran∣slations: One thing, in ge∣neral, I find from my own Experience; That where there is most Life, and Spi∣rit, in the Author, the Tran∣slator is carried on, with the greater vigour and vi∣vacity; as a Man swims faster in a Stream, than a standing Water; but where the Original is flat, and low, the Translator must be at the pains to raise him; so that the best things,

are the easiest to be done; and the dullest, the most difficult.
It were presumption in one of my Years, to pre∣tend to give an account of the Authors whom I have chosen, or their Works; to commend their Excellen∣cies, or condemn their Faults; and of the two, I dare venture to say the least of Ovid; when he himself, and all that he has writ,

have been already so well, and so fully treated of, in Mr. Dryden's Preface before his Epistles.
But I cannot choose but wonder, That a Book so extreamly delightful, so sort, and sweet, as Tibullus, has lain so long unattempt∣ed▪ but there is a Friend of ours, whom, I hope, he has been all along re∣served for, and then, he will be in the best hands

he could have fall'n in∣to
Of the three Elegies that I have ventured on; the first, from toward the mid∣dle to the end, and the whole third, pleas'd me infinitely; the second I did meerly for the sake of the last Ten, or Twelve Lines.
Tibullus must, certainly, have felt all he Writ, for

He could never have feign'd so much Passion so well; and I am apt to believe, it was not his Poetry, made him so fond, and tender a Lover▪ but rather his Love, that made him so sweet, and excellent a Poet; were it not that I should take him out of better hands, I would have attempted to have Englished him all, for I flatter my self with a Fan∣cy, that, in some things, I am somewhat of his Tem∣per,

and, how far short so∣ever I come of him in his Poetry, I resemble him, but too nearly, in some other Circumstances.
I was almost running in∣to a Complaint, that would have been both unjust, and ingrateful; for since I knew You, all occasion of Com∣plaint has been taken from me. Your Acquaintance, would have been of it self sufficient, to endear You

to any Man; but Your Fa∣vours to me, began with, and even out-ran Your Ac∣quaintance: I dare not pro∣ceed, tho' on a Subject which I am very loth to leave; permit me to add only this, that since most who ever writ, have some∣times stood in need of Favours from other Men, and since the same Fortune has attended me, I am glad however, that it threw me on You to receive them,

than whom, I know none I could have been more willingly obliged to, for them.
I am, Sir,
