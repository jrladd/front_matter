ENglish Maecenas, bounties elder brother,
The spreading wing, whereby my fortune flies;
Vnto thy wit, and vertues, and none other,
I consecrate these sacred Poesies.
Which whilst they liue, (as they must liue for euer)
Shall giue thy honour life, and let men know,
That those to succour vertue who perseuer,
Shall conquer time, and Laethes ouerflow.
pickt these flowers of Learning from their stem,
Whose heauenly Wits & golden Pens haue chac't
Dull ignorance that long affronted them.
In view of whose great glories thou art plac't,
That whilst their wisdoms in these writings florish,
Thy fame may liue, whose wealth doth wisedome norish.
