MY LORD,
IT is with Your Lordship's leave,
that this short Manuscript
of my Lord Fairfax, Your
Noble Predecessor, is now Print∣ed
from the Original, written in

his own Hand, and left in Your
Study at Denton in Yorkshire;
for it was never intended by him,
to be Published, but to remain
for the Satisfaction of his own
Relations.
But of late something has
hapned, which in the judgment
of Your Lordship, and many o∣ther
Persons of Condition, makes
it necessary that these Papers
should be sent to the Press;
which is now done, without any
Material Alterations from the
Original, but only by placing
them in the natural order of
Time.

Tho' no Copy was ever taken
by Your Lordship's Consent, yet
I know not how, some imperfect
Ones are got into other Hands.
And this being an Age, wherein
every Man presumes to Print
what he pleases, of his own, or
other Mens, we are plainly told,
That my Lord Fairfax's Memo∣rials
are ready to be Published;
and by the very same Person,
who has lately set forth some
Memoirs, wherein his Lordship
is scarce ever nam'd but with Re∣proach;
not to be excused by
what the Editor himself confesses,

That the Author was much out
of humour when he writ the
Book.
My Lord Fairfax's True Cha∣racter
is better known to many
Wise and Good Men, than to be
blemished by such envious Detra∣ctions.
Nor can his Reputation
thereby suffer with any who were
acquainted with his Person, and
the true Intentions of his Actions,
and knew him in the latter part
of his Life.
His great Misfortune, and so
he accounted it, was to be enga∣ged
in the Unhappy Wars, where∣of
he desired no other Memorial

than the Act of Oblivion; which
few that ever needed, better de∣served.
It cannot be denied, but as a
Soldier, his Life would furnish
as Noble a Memoir as the Age
has produced, from the time that
he began with a Troop of Horse,
and a few undisciplined Forces in
the North, to his being General
of a Victorious Army in the
South; which he Governed, not
as a Cypher, but with great Pru∣dence
and Conduct, in Councils of
War, as well as animated by his
Personal Courage in the Field, as
long as they had any Enemy to op∣pose
them.

But after that, they broke into
Factions, and were over-run with
Enthusiasm, and became Vngo∣vernable
by their General, when
they chose their own Agitators,
and were managed by Men of the
deepest Dissimulation and Hypo∣crisie:
by whose fair but treache∣rous
Promises, some Greater than
Himself, were deceived to their
own Ruin.
That most Tragical and Deplora∣ble
part of the Civil War, the
Death of the King, he utterly from
his Soul abhorred, and lamented to
his dying day; and never mentioned
it but with Tears in his Eyes.

The retired part of his Life
gave him greater Satisfaction than
all his former Victories, when he li∣ved
quietly at his own House at Nun-Appleton
in Yorkshire; always
earnestly wishing and praying for the
Restitution of the Royal Family,
and fully resolved to lay hold on the
first good Opportunity to contribute
his part towards it; which made
him always lookt upon with a jea∣lous
eye by the Usurpers of that
time.
As soon as he was invited by Ge∣neral
Monk to assist him against
Lambert's Army, he cheerfully
embraced the Occasion, and appear∣ed

at the Head of a brave Body of
Gentlemen of Yorkshire; and up∣on
the Reputation and Authority of
his Name, the Irish Brigade of
Twelve Thousand Horse forsook
Lambert's Army, and joyned with
him; the Consequence was the im∣mediate
breaking of all Lam∣bert's
Forces, which gave General
Monk an easy March into Eng∣land.
This was always acknowledged,
not only by General Monk, but
by the King himself, as a signal
Testimony of his Zeal to make a∣mends
for what was past, and of
the very considerable Assistance he

gave towards the restoring the Roy∣al
Family.
After he had waited on his Ma∣jesty
in Holland, as one of the
Commissioners sent to invite him
home, and had seen the King esta∣blish'd
on his Throne, he retired a∣gain
into his own Country, where he
died in Peace, in the 60th Year of
his Age, Anno 1671. leaving be∣hind
him his only Daughter, the
Lady Mary Dutchess of Buck∣ingham.
I shall now say no more of him,
but, That so long as Unfeigned
Piety towards God, Invincible Cou∣rage,
joyned with wonderful Mo∣desty,

and exceeding Good Na∣ture:
Justice and Charity to all
men in his private Life; and
an Ingenuous Acknowledgment of
his Publick Error, with hearty
Endeavours to make Reparation,
as soon as he was convinced of it,
shall be esteemed in the World: So
long shall the Name of my Lord
Fairfax be honoured by good Men,
and be had in perpetual Remem∣brance.
Your Lordship had the good for∣tune
to be born after the Storms and
Tempests of that Age: But you
have had the Honour to appear
eminently in defence of our Reli∣gion,

and Civil Rights, in this last
happy Revolution, as your Noble
Predecessor did at the Restora∣tion.
My LORD,
Apr. 22.
1699. I am
Your most affectionate Uncle,
and humble Servant,
