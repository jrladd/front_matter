My Lord,
PVrchas, a Writer of good credit here in England, gives this testimony of my Au∣thor, that no man before him, to his knowledg, hath spoken so much, and so truly, of those Oriental parts of the World, which are so little known to us, as he hath done: And that too, not upon hearsay, and report, but for the most part as an ocular Witness, and personal Actor, of, and in, all that he hath related, which is so full of Variety, and strange Occurrences, that, as another Writer af∣firms, the like will hardly be met withall elsewhere: So that the most curious Wits, which delight in reading of rare Books, will, I beleeve, find all the satisfaction they can desire in this same of his; where, without so much as stirring out of their Studies, or running the danger of Shipwrack, they may traverse the Seas, view the good∣liest

Provinces of the World, entertain themselves with stupendious and unheardof things, consider in the man∣ner of those peoples living, whom we term Barbarians, their Laws, their Riches, their Government in time of Peace and War; and, in a word, represent unto them∣selves, as in a picture, all that is most exquisite, and of greatest marvel, in the extent of Europe, Affrica, and Asia. These, together with many other remarkable matters, are contained in this Work, which I have taken the presumption to present unto your Honor, being invited thereunto by the example of two Translators of it into the Spanish and French Tongues, whereof the one dedicated it to the Archbishop of Toledo in Spain, and the other to the Cardinal Richelieu of France, both of them, the most eminent persons, of their time, in those Kingdoms: And with whom your Honor may justly be ranked, especially in respect of the Nobility of your Birth, as well as for the great Hope, which your many present Vertues, and Abilities, do give unto the World, of your future Worth, and Estimation. Be pleased then, my Lord, to receive it favorably, as a tender of the great desire I have to appear in all occasions,
