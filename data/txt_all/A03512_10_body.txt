YOur Fame (great Lady) is so lowd resounded,
By your free Trumpet, my right worthy frend;
That, with it, all my forces stand confounded,
Arm'd, and disarm'd at once, to one iust end;
To honor and describe the blest consent
Twixt your high blood and soule, in vertues rare.
Of which, my friends praise is so eminent,
That I shall hardly like his Echo fare,
To render onely th'ends of his shrill Verse.
Besides; my Bounds are short; and I must, merely,
My will to honour your rare parts, rehearse;
VVith more time, singing your renowme more clearely.
Meane-time, take Homer for my wants supply:
To whom adioyn'd, your Name shall neuer die.
