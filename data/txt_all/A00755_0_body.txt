TRIE, AND THEN TRVST, saith the olde Adage: but I must hope for trust without triall: bicause as I can compare you, (Right Honourable) to none more fit, thē to ALEXANDER the Macedon: So must I humbly re∣quest your good Lordship, to imitate that famous wor∣thie: who being sicke, was aduertised by letters, that his Phisition would empoyson him. The good Prince notwithstanding being offered the medicine by the accused, first tooke it, and dranke it vp, and then gaue the Phisition the letter of his accuser to reade: but per∣ceyuing no alteration of countenaunce in the man, he tooke good courage, and by that same medecine (al∣though extreame in operation) presently recouered his former health. In like manner (Right Honou∣rable) hauing translated and gathered together this compēdious & short way of Chirurgerie, as I thought none so meete, to whome I might consecrate these fruites of my trauailes: So must I moste humbly desire your good Lordship to peruse it, and then to make tri∣all of the contentes thereof: which being deuised and practised by a worthye and famous Capitaine, called Signior LEONARDO PHIORAVANTI of Bolo∣gnia, doth shewe both the names and natures of eche

wounde, with the order and manner to cure them in halfe the time which is or hath bene vsed heretofore, by either ignoraunt or arrogant Professors and Practi∣cioners of that noble and profounde Science, which as they more esteeme a great gaine to them-selues, then a little ease to their pacientes, and a long protracting of the cure for a large payment: So I knowe although I ease the rich, relieue the poore, and teach the ignorant: yet are there such, which being more wilfull then skil∣full, will beare me a priuate grudge for this publique commodity, and will attempt more then eyther they can or are able to answer: the which to auoyde, I most humbly craue your Honorable patronage, that accor∣ding to your name and poesie, your name and proper∣tie may be to protect the truth: So shal both the Tran∣slator the lesse doubt his foes, the Booke benefit more his friendes, and they both moste reioyce of so worthy a Patrone. Whose lyfe God prolonge with health and increase of honour, and af∣ter the course of this pilgrimage fi∣nished, enstall you among his chosen, to reigne with him in eternall fe∣licitie.
