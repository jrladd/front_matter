SEneca the Philosopher (to whome without contro∣uersie, the learned among the Latines gaue the pre∣heminence for morall Phi∣losophie) saith in fewe words, but full of sub∣stance, that Fortune is neuer at rest; and fur∣ther, that she vseth not to giue ioy without sadnesse, sweete without sowre, rest without labour, honour without enuie, and generally no felicitie vvithout his contrary: the vvhich novv I perceiue to be verified in my selfe. For vvhereas shee hath giuen me occasion of ioy

in offering mee an oportunity to shew my dutifull reuerence to your royall Maiestie, and also to our famous Citie, by your happy approach thither: thereby she hath made me sad and melancholious, in that she hath so much hastened your said coming, that I had not the leisure to prepare and file these hun∣dred morall Emblemes, accompanied with an hundred staues of verses, expositors of the same: the which in their first inuention (such as they are) I dedicate to your most excellent Maiestie. But that your Maiestie may not blame me, in that (following the errour of the Gentiles and Ethnickes) I attribute to Fortune that which (as a Christian writing to a Christian Princesse) I ought to attribute to Gods prouidence: I say therefore, that your said happy comming depēded not any whit vpon fortune, but (euen as do all other humane actions) onely vpon Gods proui∣dence, who (as it is necessary to beleeue) doth all things for the best: and that conse∣quently your sayd coming hath not bene to me hastie, but for the best. Wherefore con∣sidering

the precedent with my selfe, I do pre∣sume humbly to present vnto your Maiestie my said Emblemes, although they haue attai∣ned but to halfe the number that I intended; beseeching your Maiestie to receiue them (such as they are) according to your accusto∣med benignitie, and that with so good a will as they are by me your poore seruant offered and presented. Moreouer (Madame) it is not onely in our time that Emblemes are in ac∣count and singular regard, but it hath bene of ancient times and almost from the begin∣ning of the world: for the Egyptians (which thinke themselues to be the first people of the world) before the vse of letters, wrote by fi∣gures & images, as well of men, beasts, fowles, and fishes, as of serpents, thereby expressing their intentions, as is written by most ancient authors, Chaeremon, Orus, Apollo, and the like, which haue laboured diligently and curiously to expound the saide hieroglyphicall figures: whereof likewise Lucan maketh mention in his Pharsalie, and Polyphile the author of the

Moderns, in the description of his dreame, Clius Rhodiginus in his commentaries of the ancient readings. Alciat hath likewise in our time set out certaine Emblemes, and adorned them with Latine verses. And I (imitating these abouesaid) esteem the time wel bestow∣ed, which I employed in the deuising & beau∣tifying of these saide Emblemes: and I shall think my selfe most happy, if the reading her∣of may yeeld you any honest recreation: pray∣ing God (most noble Princesse) that he will send you long life and euer∣lasting happinesse.
Your humble seruant,
