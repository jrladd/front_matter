My LORDS and GENTLEMEN,
I Did not think I should so soon by another Edition have an Oppertunity to give you Thanks for your kind re∣ception of the former, the Honour her Majesty hath done my Book, with that of diverss Persons of Quality by their kind Censures of it, puts me above any Concern for the few Enemies I have gotten by it (if such are worthy to be call'd so who have only will, but not power to be so.) Some who have a better Opinion of themselves than (perhaps) they may deserve from others, have thought me Partial in the Characters, but sure I am, I have been Impartial accor∣ding to the best of my Judgement; of what Value that Judgment is, were impertinent for me to declare, since at last my Book must be the Test of it: If any could in∣forme me how to please all I would follow his advice, and
—Erit mihi Magnus Apollo.
That Ingenious Arts have so great Incouragement (which I well perceive by the kind reception of this Trifle) is no small satisfaction to me, although I have no Interest in it otherways then as a well-wisher to my Country, being no Professor only a Lover of the Art of Painting, that it may still more Flourish, till it makes England more Famous then ever Greece was for the Product of Noble Arts and Sciences: Is the hearty desire of
My Lords and Gentlemen,
