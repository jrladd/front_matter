SIR, this Poeme of mine, which I imparted to you, at my being with you at your lodging at London in Maie last, brought at length to perfection, (emboldned by your wonted fauours) I aduenture to make you Patron of. Thus Sir you see I haue aduentured to the world, with what like or dis∣like, I know not, if it please, (which I much doubt of) I pray you then be partaker of that which I shall esteeme not my least good; if dislike, it shall lessen some part of my griefe; if it please you to allow but of my loue: howsoeuer, I pray you accept it as kindely as I offer it, which though without many protestations, yet (I assure you) with much desire of your ho∣nour. Thus vntill such time as I may in some more larger measure, make knowne my loue to the happy and generous familie of the Gooderes, (to which I confesse my selfe to be beholding to, for the most part of my education) I wish you all happinesse.
