SIR,
I Hold it no Sa∣criledge, after the Example of our
Fore-Fathers of the Old Testament, (whom the
Law enjoyned to offer their First-borne unto the LORD.) to present you, as my Rightfull Lord with the Premis∣ses and First-Fruits of the spare Houres, J lately spent in the Translation of the ensuing Discourse: For, J know none, after the
King, and the Right Honourable Your Father, unto whom I owe this due, but Your Selfe: Since, His Ma∣jesty hath set so great a Value on Your Me∣rit, Vertue, and Birth, as to designe You to the Government of that Isle, where J tooke my first Breath, and where the Right Honourable Your Father, makes the Inhabitants to live in a Golden Age: where∣by they are bound to lift up their joynt Votes unto
Heaven, for His Ma∣jesties Long and Flourishing Raigne
in Health and Hap∣pinesse; who doth afford them, so
Good & Wise Governours, and those continued in a
most No∣ble Line; so as I ac∣knowledge myselfe divers waies obliged to dedicate unto You this small La∣bour: First, as to my
Rightfull Lord, being confident, that in imitation of the Right Honou∣rable Your Father, You will cause the said Jnhabitants, to enjoy the like Peace and Plenty, under Your Govern∣ment: next, as Holding my small Patrimony and Fee, immediately from You, whilst You repre∣sent the Kings Majesty there: whereunto may al∣so be added, the infinite Obligations J owe You in particular; whereby J reape this further advan∣tage, that slaunderers can∣not justly say, that J have any further end herein, but onely to render
You most humble thankes, for the benefits have already received, from Your Generosity. Besides, I am confident, that
Your Name appearing in the Frontispice of this Booke, will serve to Protect it, from the malice of those, who would disallow the Authour for being a Spa∣niard, which J assure my selfe, will be no lesse ac∣ceptable in this Court in the English habit (being countenanced by
You, who seeme to be the Moe∣cenas of Strangers) then he hath beene in France, clad according to the fa∣shion there; where he hath passed the Presse, without other, then Vniversall Pa∣tronage: For, seeing his chiefe aime, is, to suppresse Vice, and to open a path to Vertue, (though in a Satyricall way,) his de∣signe and mine cannot but take effect. Since, detesting Vice,
You possesse Vertue it selfe, and are no way like unto those Courtiers, of whom he speakes in this Treatise: otherwise, that Great Queene (whose Life may much rather be Admired, then Imi∣tated) had not elected You, for the discharge of one of the Most Honourable Places in Her Service. Finally, as You are borne to bee Happy on Earth, that You may likewise bee so in Heaven, shall bee the constant Prayer of him who is,
SIR,
