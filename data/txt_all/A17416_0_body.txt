PEace be vn∣to
you and
loue, with
faith from
God the father, and the
Lord Iesus Christ. The

impertunitie, of diuerse
of my hearers, and the ex∣pectation
of many of all
sorts, together with my de¦sire
to yeeld some account
of my long vndelightfull
leasure, haue inclined me
to prepare some of my
publike and priuate la∣bours,
for the common
view: hoping that the a∣bounding
respect of my
friends will couer the
wants, and weakenesses
which other men will soo∣ner
espie. Howsoeuer I
haue long meditated, a
worke of greater labour,
then this ensuing treatise
yet in the meane time I

haue beene willing to tast
the approbation of good
men, and make my best
aduauntage of the cen∣sures
of the many minded
multitude, by aduentu∣ring
to send foorth these
first fruites, as a handfull
gathered out of the rest.
Worthie Gentle∣woman,
there are manie
reasons induce me to pub∣lish
these signes vnder
your name, your singular
loue and liking of my mi∣nisterie,
together vvith
your reuerent and willing
entertainement, of faith∣full
Ministers (receiuing
them as the messengers of

the Churches, and the glo∣rie
of Christ as partners
and fellow helpers, walk∣ing
in the same spirit)
challengeth from vs some
publike testimonie of our
acknowledgemēt of Gods
grace, and of the ioy,
vvherewith vve reioyced
for your sake; besides con∣stant
indeauour to make
vse of all opportunities
for your resolution, and
direction, in the seuerall
conflicts, and cases of
your conscience. I haue
had occasion fully to know
your order, and manner
of life, your desires, pur∣poses,
teares, & vpright∣nes,

your faith, your loue,
your obedience: and ther∣fore
being assured, that
you are marked euen
with euerie one of these
signes; vvhy should I not
say vnto you, as somtimes
Iob said of himselfe.Iob 31. 35 Be∣hold
your signes that
the Almightie wil wit∣nesse
for you. And I am
vvell assured, that this
treatise vvill finde good
accesse vnto the hands
and hearts of diuers in
these parts, euen for the
loue they beare to you, and
for the good they novv
heare you haue by ex∣perience
reaped from

these. Neither had I beene
easily drawne to publish
these, but that hauing oc∣casion
in conference with
many to make vse of thē,
I could hardly satisfie
them vvith coppies. I
spare to alleadge other
reasons.
Novv vvhat remains
but that I should beseech
you, and all those vvho
finde by these signes the
assurance of Gods eternal
loue, euen to honour the
Lord vvith the continu∣all
sacrifices of praise, the
fruite of your lips,Heb. 13 vvith
confession to his name, oh
loue the Lord vvith your

whole heart, and make
his praise glorious, and a∣bound
more and more, in
the fruites of sincere life,
and in all holy, and hum∣ble
conuersation, liue by
faith, and in nothing be
carefull,Phil. 4, 6 but in all things,
let your requests he made
knowne to God, vvith
thanksgiuing: and as you
haue receiued mercy faint
not, neither be descoraged
vnder the sence of your
infirmities and vvants,2, Cor, 4, 1
for they that vvaite vpon
the Lord,Esa. 40, 31 shall renevv
their strength, the Lord
vvill power his spirit vp∣on
your seede, &Isa, 44, 4 his bles∣sing

vpon your buds: the
sunne of righteousnesse
vvill arise, and there is
healing vnder his wings.
You haue a high Priest,Ma. 4, 2
that is touched vvith in∣firmities,Hob. 5. 15 16 and therefore
you may goe boldly to the
throne of grace, to seeke
grace and mercy to helpe
in time of neede: the pow∣er
of God is made knowne
in vveakenesse,2 Cor. 12 and his
grace will be sufficient:
the Lord keepeth the feete
of his Saints,1. Sam. 2, 9 and vvill
supplie all your vvants
vvith his riches in glory.Psa. 66, 8, 9
Blessed be the Lord that
holdeth our soules in life,

and suffereth not our
feee to be moued.
Gracious gentlewoman
be confident in this,Psa. 1, 6 that
God which hath begun
his good worke will per∣forme
it, till the day of
Christ▪ for his foundation
remaineth sure:2. Tim. 2, 19. and hee
euer liueth that maketh
intercession for you,Heb. 7, 25 and
the mortall seede abideth,1. Ioh. 3, 9
and Christ will be,Reu. 21. 6 Ome∣ga
as well as Alpha, the
end as well as the begin∣ning:
neither feare the
reproach of men, for there
is a hiding place with the
Lord,Psa. 31, 20 from the strife of
tongues; and he will put

to silence those lying lipps
that speake such grieuous
things,Psal, 31, 18 so proudly, so con∣temptuously:
vvaite on
the Lord, and keepe his
waie; they shall assuredly
make an account to the
Iudge of quicke and dead,1. Pet▪ 4, 5
that speake euill of the in∣nocent,
And the same
God and father of mercie
that hath directed, your
heart vnto his loue, and
refreshed your spirit with
the vnspeakeable ioies of
his presence, finish his
owne worke in you: and
as you haue professed, a
good profession before
many that will witnesse,

how vnblameably you
haue behaued your selfe
among them that beleeue;
so stand fast in the Lord,
be stil an example of faith
and puritie, of loue and
feruencie, of meekenesse,
and humilitie, of tender∣nesse,
and harmelesnesse,
of shamefastnesse, and so∣brietie,
of mercie and
good workes, as becom∣meth
a woman professing
godlinesse, that they may
bee ashamed which shall
falsely accuse your good
conuersation in Christ,
keepe the Doctrine you
haue receiued, seeing you
haue learned Christ, as

the trth is in him. Striue
to increase in loue and o∣bedience
to your husband
and care of your chril∣dren
& familie, and shew
all faithfulnesse, and dili∣gence
in your particular
calling. Prouoke your kin∣dred
and acquaintance
vnto repentance, faith,
praier, loue, fellowship in
the Gospell, and good
workes, that thanksgi∣uing
may be giuen by ma∣ny
to God for you. Let
the word of Christ bee
still your guide: watch
vnto praier, receiue them
that feare God, and make
much of such. Let pati∣ence

haue her perfect
worke, and commit your
waies to God, and trust
in him. The Lord make
you to abound in loue yet
more and more, in know∣ledge,
and in all iudge∣ment,
that you may still
approue things that are
excellent, and be blame∣lesse
in the middest of a
crooked & peruerse peo∣ple:
the Lord perfect in
you whatsoeuer is vvan∣ting,
and fulfill the good
pleasure of his goodnesse,
and the worke of your
faith with power. The
Lord increase in you that
holy couetousnesse, to be

with the Lord, looking
for the blessed hope, and
glorious appearing of the
great God, and our Saui∣our
Iesus Christ.
Farewell. 
May. 1614.
