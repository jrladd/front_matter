My LORD;
BEing commanded by my Lords the Judges, the High-Sheriff, and the most Honourable of the Auditory, to which this Sermon was preached, to publish it; I was induced in de∣ference to their better Judgments to hope, that what such approved of from the Pulpit, might do some good from the Press. The Design was sincere, according to my mean Capacity, to recommend to those that heard me their Duties, suitable to the occasion, and to discourage that Immorality, which hath in this last Age been the Disgrace of our Gentry, and the Bane of this Nation. I presume to prefix your Lordship's Name to it, not only be∣cause I am assured you will readily lend me the Authority thereof, for promoting so good a Design,
but also that I may lay hold on this first opportunity, to make a publick Acknowledgment of your ex∣traordinary Favour and Bounty in preferring me to that Station, which I now enjoy in the Church. That this plain Discourse may be some way ser∣viceable for the promoting of Justice, Charity and Sobriety, for which end it was first preached, and is now published; That your Lordship may long live among us, to second that great Example recom∣mended in it, by your own, and that God will at length reward in Heaven your Kindness and Bounty to me here, is the hearty Prayer of,
