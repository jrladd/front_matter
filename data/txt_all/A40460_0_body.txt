MY LORD,
THis small Treatise, like a Travel in∣to the Mountains of the Moon, for the Bed of Nile, being a full Inquiry into the Little Birth of our GREAT LEWIS, Your Lordships Favour to the Subject of this History, has encouraged the fixing so No∣ble a Name before it: Nor let Our Mighty Monsieur's Idolizers themselves take Offence at the Theme, it being, perhaps, not the least of his Honour, that so Diminutive a Seed should give Root and Production to so Pro∣digious a Spreading Greatness: Nor can I do his Homagers, and Adorers a kinder piece of Justice, than making a Consecrated Relique of his very Swaddling-Clouts. I confess, in∣deed, I have taken the easier Work in hand; the Delineation of his minuter Original, be∣ing something a fezible Undertaking, when the Description of his fuller Growth, the Manhood of our Prodigious Hero, is almost Impossible: Impossible, indeed, when all the publick Declarations, the whole Neighbour∣ing World around him, have so justly, and so unanimously confess'd their Inability of matching his Lineaments, even amongst Hea∣thens and Turks; and truly if the least re∣sembling Feature of him can be found in the spacious Creation, we must look amongst the Remoter Indies for it; and consider Our
 Great Lewis's Ambition, as only a more Hideous, Wild, Indian Delirium, running a Muck at all Mankind.
But while I presume to commit this piece into your Lordships Protection, my Duty leads me to a just and awful Veneration of that Honour to which I Address. In all the Rapidity of our late Driving Jehu's, your Lordship carries this Triumph, that in their highest Exaltation, and most formidable Pre∣valence, you never bent a Knee. Your Spirit was too Masculine to flow with a Tide, and chose rather singly to stand the Indignation of Power, than herd amongst the Flatterers of it. And if so much true British Merit, as shines in your Lordship, so late a Royal Fa∣vourite, makes so new a Figure in Court, we are to consider, that in the former Sway, when French Counsels and French Gold reigned too Potent, Your Lordship thought Your self a very unqualified English Cour∣tier in a Court so little an English One, and 'tis perhaps Your Highest Glory, to have no sooner a Call to Glory.
But, alas! Your Lordships Historian is not my Province; 'tis enough to have chosen a Patriot for a Patron, and to pride my self in this occasion of publishing my self,
My Lord,
