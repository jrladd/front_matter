My LORD
THere are divers Motives
(humbly under Favour)
which have induced me to
this Dedication.

The first, That besides those severe
and high-solid Studies which attend
Theological Speculations, (wherein
your Lordship is eminent even to admi∣ration)
'tis evidently known, my Lord,
that you have not onely a profound
Judgement, but also a sublime Ge∣nius
in Poetical Compositions. Now,
my Lord, 'tis upon good Record, that
Poets were the first Divines and Phi∣losophers;
and as a great Wit well ob∣serveth,
Poetry is the clearest Light to
prove that Man hath an Intellectual
Soul, and Ray of Divinity shining in
him.
The second Motive was, my Lord,
That I finde in the Works of this Ex∣cellent

Author, some signal Passages
that discover the particular Obser∣vance
and high Veneration not onely he
hath (but many thousands more) of
your Lordships dear Relations, and your
own most Unparallel'd Merits.
The third Motive was, my Lord,
That I might lay hold on this happy op∣portunity
of publickly confessing those
Obligations I cannot now fairly Con∣ceal,
nor yet fitly Cancel; that the
World as well as your most honourable
Lordship may be sensible of these Over∣tures
of my devoted Gratitude; which
till I can exemplifie in a Prolixer Pre∣sent,
I beseech your Lordship to accept
this small Homage and contracted Ten∣der

of his humble Devoire, who is otherwise
unlimited,
My Lord,
