My Lord, my Lady;
HOnour shal it ever be to me, to obey your cō∣mands; at my Lords I preacht, at my La∣dies I printed: but the disadvan∣tage of so short an allowance of time as two daies, & mine inabi∣lities besides, will shew this not to be a Sermon fit for, though it hath past, the Presse. This will
be spoken when tis read; but hee riseth betimes, that thinkes worse of it than I doe. I made a covenant with mine eyes, that they should neither goe out in sleepe nor slumber, untill they had lighted mee to performe my Lords pleasure; which if I have done I have a protection▪ and no man shall dare to arrest me, be∣cause I was imploi'd in his ser∣vice. I know in these times of war, I shall meet with some tall men of their hands, that will put every syllable to the sword: but tis an honour to me to die in my Commanders service. Some mouthes are Musket-bore, and doe so scatter, that though I passe the Pikes, yet I cannot
scape them: yet I shall thinke my selfe out of Gunne-shot, when your Lordship hath given mee a dispensation for not gi∣ving a due honour to the most promising, Lady (if I flatter, I flatter my self) that ever mine eyes beheld. The Leviticall law gives a large restitution for a dammage; God, out of his mercy, when hee thinkes fit, a greater for what hee takes. I will therefore make bold with my Reader, and change my E∣pistle into a Prayer. May the God of fruitfulnesse give your Honours a numerous, and an o∣bedient issue, in supplement of her that's gone now to him, that you and yours after a length of
happinesse heere may succeed, exceed her in glory, shall ever be the praier of him who is, and professeth still to continue,
