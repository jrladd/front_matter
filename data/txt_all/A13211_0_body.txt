My Lord, and Gentlemen,
THE lines fol∣lowing begin mournfully, and end thankfully; the mourning was, if not altogether, yet almost on∣ly
the Cities; the Thank∣fulnesse is most of all, if not onely by, yet for the City: of these the beginning ex∣presse the one, the ending the other: nor one, nor o∣ther comming abroad could finde shelter more safely or more iustly then under the umbracula of your Honors and Worships protection: Into which custody if it shal please you to take them, the Author will, as he is bound, pray
that Gods iudgments may ever reape your Repen∣tance, your Repentance re∣ceiue his deliverance, his deliverance accept your thankfulnesse, through Ie∣sus Christ; in whom is ever ready to serve you,
