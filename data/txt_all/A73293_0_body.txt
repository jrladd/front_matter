NOble Princesse, when you consider the seuerall dignities of the world, in one man so eminent, and neere and deare a Friend vnto you, it cannot but worke a deepe impres∣sion in your minde, of so great a losse befallen you, whom the world doth take notice of, and my Elegie doth ex∣presse: but not to make you mourne further; satis sufficit. So on the other side, considering the frailtie of life in Princes, as well as others, I could indeuour to comfort you with the after-ioyes of his mortalitie, to stay your griefe, and teares, you being wise, and knowing that our chiefe dependancy must not be in mortall men, whose life and meanes of life is but transitory, as we our selues, and all things that we possesse be, and therefore must put our trust and confidence in the Jm∣mortall God, and Christ his Sonne, who is the wiper away of all teares, and the true and euerlasting Husband of his Spouse, the Church, and so by con∣sequence, of you, a Vertuous and Religious Duchesse: who by place, person, and parts, deserues the Antiquitie and preheminence of many, which may stirre vp some comfort in you. The sympathie of his noble death and your tender heart-grieuing, moues me to condole, and to be partaker with you both in heart and Pen, for so high and iust a Steward to God and King; who as here, so in Heauen, Did enter into his Masters Ioy; the want of which Ioy in vs, should make vs more mourne, then his present death, since death to all is a debt which of necessitie must be paid, and necessitie hath no law to relieue it selfe by too much griefe, but wisely to make of such necessitie a Vertue by a holy contentation of Gods will: Let this suffice, to content you with pati∣ence
as Iob, and with his Hearse, rehearse not your griefes, but as gracious Francis, infranchise your selfe with truest comforts, and let Honour be ho∣nourably solemnized, as Rebecca did good Isaack, of which, J doubt not of your large and liberall loue therein, since you may conceiue another comfort infolded within your sorrowes, by the noble and worthy assembly of Parlia∣ment, that attendeth their loues to his Funerall, as they intended his loue, if God had so appointed, to the Parliament. J haue writ this according to the promise made to your Grace by a worthy friend of mine, not as a profes∣sed Poet, but as a confessed seruant to your loue, which picke not my Conceits from the fruit of other mens labours, in Funerall Elegies, and get the start of presentation to your Highnesse, and the worlds view: yet not a better re∣presentation of sincere loue to the Noble Duke departed, and your liuing Graces, then I by these few lines hereafter shall expresse vnto you, If not in Art, yet in heart. Thus crauing your pardon and acceptance:
