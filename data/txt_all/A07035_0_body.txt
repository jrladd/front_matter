WHen your honor was last here in the Netherlands Lord Am∣bassadour
extraordinarie for his Matie of great Brittane; with
the Lords the States Generall of the United Provinces: It
pleased your honor, to employ your servant in collecting,
and abbreviating some militarie Abstracts. Since which
time, in regard of my longe service, I haue gained more ex∣perience,
and studied my profession some what better. To
this end, for the good of my Countrie, and Nation (for every
man by a naturall inclination, ought to add some thing there∣vnto)
I haue of late vndertaken, and written a treatise intituled, The Principles of the Art Militaire, practised in the vvarres of the Vnited Netherlands, represented by
figure, the vvord of Commaund, an demonstration, disgesting the same into three parts,
whereof the first, showes the dutie, and office of a Captaine, his inferiour officers,
the true forme observed amongst vs in the exercising of a Companie, the Ordering
of a Regiment, and our lawes, and articles of Marshall discipline. The second part
treats of the severall duties of the officers of the field, and the diverse formes of
ranging horse and foote in battle-ray, showne by Prince Maurice of famous me∣morie,
& his brother his highnesse the Prince of Orange our Generall that now is,
at sundry times, and in diverse places. The third part, handles the place & office
of the Master (or Generall) of the Ordinance and all the officers vnder his traine
and Commaund, together with the Ordinance, Munition, Engines, Instruments, Ma∣terials,
and all necessarie preparations, and Equipage, belonging to an Armie & other
officers depending on the warre. But yet (me thinkes) these three parts, are de∣fectiue
and incompleate, vnlesse a fourth be added therevnto, which is the excellent
art of Fortification. To this effect, I haue translated into English out of French, the
workes of two famous Mathematicians of our moderne times, namely Mr. Samuell
Marolois, and Mr. Albert Girard, who haue written at large vpon this subject.
As for exemple, what valour, and this art haue done, witnesse the famous siege of
Ostend, for by the meanes hereof never was tovvne so brauely disputed, never For∣tresse
(in the memorie of man) so couragiously defended, having to doe with so
braue an Ennemy, who was fainte during the time of three yeeres, three months,
and odd daies Siege, to gett this towne (as it were) by ynchmeale: what should I say
by ynchmeale? when they were driven to such nonpluses, that they could not gett
a strawes breadth of vs, but held vp many daies, and weekes (finding such a resi∣stance)
their approches, before they could advance them any further: yea which is
more, when they had approched, sapt, and mined into the very bowels of some
Bulvvarkes, blowing them vp with the violence of pouder, steeple-high into the
aire, each Ennemy then strived at push of the pike, who should become master of
that falne Earth, to turne it vp one against an other. And at last being master of
the deformed karkeis of a torne Bulwarke or two, found presently a new retrench∣ment,
or cutting of cast vp before them; being then forced to sapp forward againe,
and make new workes, and mines, which lasted so longe, and was so well disputed,
till they gott the halfe of the towne, before they had the whole. This men, valour,

& fortification (by the help of Almighty God) can doe. Againe, this was one of Prince
Maurice (of blessed memorie) his master peeces, for by this art, he was so warie, and
carefull of the Liues of his men, that he choose rather, to spend the States a hun∣dred
pound, in casting vp a trench, a Sap, and a vvorke, rather then to hasard & loose
the life of a man, so good a Menagier was he for the preserving of his men. This
Art then, being of such singular vse, for the makeing of all manner of Fortresses, and
vvorkes both Regular, and irregular, even from a quadrangle which is a fortresse with
foure points or Bulwarkes, to a Dodecon, which is a towne or a fortresse with twelue
Bastions, for the preservation of men in a Warre defensiue, comes in most humble
wise, to craue your honours gracious patronage, that vnder your favour, and pro∣tection,
it may come to the view of the world, an maye be helpfull to such, as are
desirous and ingenious to studie this noble art, which if it be acceptable vnto your
honor, then I shall think my time well spent, and acknowledg my selfe much bound
vnto your honor, and shalbe obliged not onely to pray vnto the Almightie, to
preserue yow and yours in health; but also to crowne you hereafter with everla∣sting
felicity, resting▪
