Right Honourable,
THE Author of these ensu∣ing Sheets, approaching towards the finishing his Thirtieth Year, from being Im∣ployed
a Warranted Officer in di∣vers of the Ships of the Royal-Navy; during which time, by means of his negotiating through the Offices thereof, being many ways Imployed therein; as also his sundry Voyages made into Foreign Parts, imployed in the said Ships; and in divers Fleets, Battles, General and Particular; in all which Times, Places, and Occasions, he hath been a true Observer, and diligent Inspector into the Proceedings, Actions, and Methods thereof: And that his weak and small Genius in so high Concerns, and weighty Af∣fairs,
might not be altogether Abor∣tive in his Speculations, through the whole Series thereof, he hath presumed, according to his Abili∣ties, to commit the same to Writ∣ing in these few Papers, with his Sentiments Thereon: And now chiefly when the Nation hath so lately undergone such great Re∣volutions, and yet lieth under the heavy Pressures of Foreign Wars. And understanding your Lord∣ship hath slighted your Ease, in these Days of Softness and Effe∣minacy, and condescended to take upon you a Post, wherein you may be most serviceable to Their
Majesties, and Their Kingdoms, in the Management of Their Royal-Navy, in these Times of threat∣ning Dangers. Even as all small Rivolets hasten to the great Ri∣vers, so he from his acknowledged Duty unto Your Lordship, infla∣med with the Fame of Your Lord∣ship's Indefatigable Industry, to Inspect the Navy for the Advance∣ment thereof in all Military Exe∣cutions, to Promote and Main∣tain, the Right and Dominions of Their Majesties, and Their King∣doms in the Seas. He presumeth therefore humbly to Dedicate these unworthy Papers unto Your
Lordship's favourable Perusal, that if perhaps Your Lordship shall find any thing therein, which may conduce to the ends aforesaid, he shall heartily rejoyce, to be so hap∣py in contributing, though never so small a Matter, towards Your Lordship's Attainment of Your Desires: And knowing there can be nothing of this Nature writ∣ten, but some will be Male-con∣tent, and spurn at the same; and perhaps, think that the Bolt is shot at them, which will be their great Mi∣stake; yet may their Malice stretch so far, as may be to the injury of him, and his Innocent Indeavours:
Wherefore he humbly prays Your Lordship, favourably to Pardon the Errors therein, to accept his well-meaning Endeavours, and al∣so take him, and it, under Your Lordship's Shadow and Protecti∣on; and screen them from the scorching Fury of the Malicious: And that Your Lordship's great Industry and Endeavours, may prove to the Advance of the Naval Affairs of England; to the Over∣throw of the Enemies of our Ma∣ritime Peace; to the setling us in our Maritime Dominion; to the Honour, Safety, and Wealth of Their Majesties, and Their King∣doms; to due Honour and Praise
to Your Lordship for Your great Care and Labour, and all to the Honour and Glory of God, is the Prayer of
