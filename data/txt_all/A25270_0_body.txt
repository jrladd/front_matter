Dear Honest Drawcansir,
THE Hot Fit of Rhiming being just off, and the Cold Fit of Prose Succeeding, I am as it were necessitated to return you my Hearty Thanks for the Honourable Character you gave me in your last Essay, putting me in the Van of so many Illustrious Worthies, who have Signaliz'd themselves to Posterity, by their Elaborate Writâˆ£ings, particularly with Shirly and Kainophilus; but I' Faith Little Mercury, 'twas something bold to Draw upon the whole Society of the Quill at once before you gave the least notice of your Intentions in the Gazette; but like your Name sake in the Rehearsal, You Drink, you Huff, you Strut, look Big and Stare,
And all this you can do, because you dare.
I did not know till now, that I was of Noble Blood (supposing my self to be of Plebean Extraction) but you it seems are pleased to fetch my Pedegree from Bantam and Morocco, two Countries widely asunder; and I believe 'twill puzle all the Parish Books in those two Kingdoms to Determine whether the Renegade my Father went over to Bantam, or the Strowling Gypsy my Mother rambled into the Moors Country to be delivered of me: However you make me some Amends about six Lines off, by accquainting the World with my unknown Accomplishments of Singing, Dancing, and Story Telling (excellent Vertues in a Jack-pudding or Merry Andrew) well E'gad Little Smirk, thou hast a plaguey faculty at Guessing. When thy hand was in, why couldst thou not have said that I could Conjure, Show slights of Hand, Dance on the Ropes, and Pit, Box and Gallery with any Mountebank in Italy? But those Accomplishments with Additions I expect in your next.
You talk something of a Humming in your Dedication, a word as difficult to be understood as Tetrachymagogon. But by way of Gratitude, if you please to allow some Gentlemen and my Self the Honour of your Company in the Apollo, at the Devil Tavern in Fleetstreet on Easter-Eve, you shall be most civilly Treated, and be made as free of the Blanket as ever was Sancho Pancha. In the mean time I am
