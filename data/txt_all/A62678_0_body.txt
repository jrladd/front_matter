MADAM,
THE Corruptions of this Age are so strangly increased and complyed with, that few com∣plain of them as Temptations; but, with a Modish Curiosity, rather affect them as things fashionable; so that to re∣buke Vice boldly, requires more Courage than our Sex usually pretend to; and not to fall in with it, looks like a piece of Singu∣larity.

But, thanks be to GOD, that Piety and Vertue have still a good Name in the World; and there are some Illustrious Persons, who, by their great Examples, give them Coun∣tenance, and a just Patronage. Hence it is I address Your Ladyship for Sanctuary, knowing, that amidst the Storms and Per∣secutions of a degenerate Age, my humble Endeavours can meet with no securer Har∣bor, than under Your Ladyships Protection.
I have, in this Essay, presented Your La∣dyship with some Consolatory Thoughts, un∣der the uneasy Circumstances of my own Life: This can affect Your Ladyship no o∣therwise than as You are surrounded with the Contraries; or in that You have nobly conquer'd those Sorrows, which weaker Minds are forced to labour under all their Days.
May Heaven continue its Blessings to the Age, by preserving Your Ladyship as
the great Luminary of Devotion, and Cha∣rity, and the Patroness of all those who, in their Order, practise the same Vertues in Sincerity: Which is the Prayers of,
MADAM,
