MADAM,
YOƲR Majesties Eminent Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and the tender Compassion and Charity you have shewn to multitudes of French Refugiez, of all Ranks and De∣grees, who have been forced to fly hither for your Glorious Protection and Relief, encourages me to

hope, that your Majesty will be pleased to pardon me this presumption, of humbly laying at your Royal Feet an account of their deplorable Afflictions, by permitting me to dedicate to your Illustrious Name, this Translation of their History of the Edict of NANTES.
Your Majesty may see in it with what an asto∣nishing Barbarity the formerly Flourishing Churches of France have been ruined and destroyed; with what Rage, Fury and Cruelty their Persecutors have treated them, and how many thousand Dan∣gers those miserable Innocents have run, to find Sanctuary in your Kingdoms.
The Reading of this History, how afflicting soever it may be in it, self will, I am confi∣dent, Madam, notwithstanding afford your Majesty some considerable satisfaction; for tho' the Ruin of these Churches cannot but very deeply afflict your most tender and Christian Breast, yet your Extream Piety will however receive no small measure of Joy and Comfort, to find, that this corrupt and Infi∣del

Age, wherein Open wickedness hath reigned with Reputation, hath yet produced Martyrs and Confessors, whose Courage and Constancy have scarce been inferiour to those of the Primitive Church, tho' they have suffered almost beyond Expression for the sake of their Religion, and for their Holy Faith have undergone a Persecution, which, taken in all its dismal Circumstances, is far beyond the Blackest of any that can be met with, in all the Records and Monuments of Pagan Antiquity.
Nor, may it please your Majesty, will this Hi∣story be unprofitable to your Subjects; for it will teach them what Dutiful Respect, Obedience and Acknowledgements they owe to your most Excellent Majesties, by informing them what a Horrid Per∣secution Popery was preparing for them too, and the unexpressible Calamities into which they must ine∣vitably have fallen, if God had not wrought a Wonderful Salvation for us, by making use of your Majesties Piety and Zeal, to effect this Great and Happy Deliverance.
That signal Favour Heaven was pleased to shew to England, at a time, when both Church and State were over-run with Popery and Arbitrary Power, and brought to the point of Destruction, gives those miserable Refugiez strong hopes, that they shall one day be re-established; as it doth your Subjects a mighty Expectation, of seeing a No∣ble Change of the whole Face of Affairs, with re∣spect to the Peace and Liberty of EUROPE.
Your Refugiez have no other Recourse, next to Almighty God, than to your Majesties, who are engaged to labour their Re-establishment, not only by that Tenderness and Compassion, so natural to all generous Souls, and which is so peculiarly Bright in your Majesty to the Afflicted and the Miserable; but by the endearing Obligations which one and the same Communion lays upon you, by all the Christian and Honourable ways, to procure it for them.
And here, MADAM, I have a fair occasion to speak of the Royal Vertues which adorn your Maje∣sties; to acquaint the world with that profound Reverence you have for the Protestant Religion, and with that Great Zeal you shew in the Defence of it: with what a disinteressed Vertue the KING opposes the unjust Ʋsurpations of France, with what firm∣ness of Courage He hath exposed his Royal Person to the most imminent Dangers of War; with what Prudence and Policy He hath united so many Princes of Europe of different Religions, and confederated them all in a steady Resolution, to put an end to those unparalelled Violences which have so long raged in a Neighbouring Kingdom, under the name of a Most Christian Monarch, who notwithstanding makes▪ it his Glory to be Insensible of those almost Insupporta∣ble Calamities, which his own Subjects suffer and groan under by his means, and is the In∣humane Ravisher of the Publick Liberties of Christendom.
I could enlarge upon these, and many other of your Great and Illustrious Vertues, which are the supream Ornaments of Crowns and Scepters; but where your Majesty commands my Silence, I have no∣thing to do but to submit, and to pay a most profound Obedience.
But I humbly beseech your permission to let me speak this Truth, that your Majesties have both testified, that an Ʋniversal Good hath been the end of all your Royal Cares, that you have preferred, the Raising of the Honour of the Nation, to your own Glory.
How often hath that precious, that Invaluable Life been hazarded abroad in the publick Cause of the Rights and Liberties of almost all Europe; whilst You, MADAM, here at home, have governed with so Careful, so Just, so Wise an Administration, that You have ren∣dered your Name no less Illustrious for your Pru∣dence, and the rest of your shining Vertues, than the Greatest King in the World, I mean, WILLIAM III. hath made His Glorious, by His Valour, Conduct, and the Infinite other great Qualities of his Mind: and

both your Sovereign Majesties are become the De∣light of your Honest and Loyal Subjects, the Admi∣ration of Foreign Princes, and the great Dread and Terrour of your Enemies.
May you Both live long, that your People may be happy long, and rejoyce long in you; and that your Majesties may be long happy in your People, having the Hearts, the Esteem, and Veneration of ALL your Subjects to be the Felicity and Glory of your Reign.
