SIR,
TThe Memory and Contempla∣tion of good Offices recei∣ved, which, by their own na∣ture, and impulsion, have inclined other men to bee active in their returnes, have not wrought me into so much boldness; For when I considered my obligation to your favors I was still deter∣red by their greatness and number; For in my poverty I had thoughts not without Ambition to reach them with some merit, but when I was studying to proportion my gratitude, I fell much lower than when I was the object of your mercy. The way to releeve my self, is no more to look at what you have confer'd, but on
the bestower, for I have now learn'd to sepa∣rate you from your benefits, and to couvey my self into your pardon, by the exercise of your Charity. Thus in place of cancelling my former debts, I put your vertue to a new disburs∣ment: Witness this Composition, which after its birth, had in my thoughts a dedication to your name, although it but now took the bold∣ness to wear it in the forehean both as an Or∣nament and preserver. You were pleas'd to grace it with your fair opinion, when it was re∣presented, and though it appear not in that naturall Dress of the Scene, nor so powerfull, as when it had the soul of action, yet your smile upon it now will give it second animati∣on; by which I shall derive after so long a si∣lence, a Confirmation of my happiness, in be∣ing still received
Sir
