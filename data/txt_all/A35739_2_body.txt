HAving formerly Published a Sett of Musick in folio, Entituled, [CAN∣TICA SACRA:] Containing Latin Hymns for Two and Three Voices to the ORGAN: all Compos'd by our Famous Countrey-man Mr Richard Dering then Organist to the late Royal QUEEN: And those finding so kind acceptance abroad, (especially among the most judicious Professors of Musick) gave me Encouragement to spare nor Cost nor Pains to obtain more of that nature, to publish as an Addition for the Benefit of such as had the Former. Those at the beginning (from the Second to the Eighth) are much of Mr Dering's Way, yet by some believed not to be his, but all that have heard them conclude them Excellently Good. The rest that follow have their Authors Names written in their Foreheads, from whose Own Hands I receiv'd them: which choice HYMNS, when exactly perform'd, will more advance their due Commendations than my Pen is able.
With these Latin Hymns I thought to have concluded this Second Sett; but some noble Friends Seeing and Hearing perform'd (at my House) several Choice English Anthems of like nature for Two Voices to an ORGAN, which I had ob∣tain'd from the Hands of these Excellent and knowing Masters, viz: Dr Gibbons, Dr Rogers, Mr Matthew Locke, and Others; They much importun'd me to Joyn them with the Rest. To Gratifie their Desires, and to Further any Thing that may conduce to the Advancement of this Divine Science, I willingly consented, not doubting but all that Know me will Believe I am a devout Lover and En∣courager of MUSICK: For which purpose, I have also adventured, at the End of all, to adde some few Compositions of mine Own; And if they find the least approbation, they'll encourage my further attempts of more.
As to the whole Work, I have (to the best of my skill) contriv'd it both for publick and private use, as will appear not only by the Fewness of Parts, but the CANTUS Parts are all Printed in the G sol re vt Cliffe, and may properly be Sung by Men as well as Boyes or Weomen (to avoid the late Complaint against our use of so many various Cliffs.) And the English Anthems have often been Sung in severall Cathedral Churches and Colledge Chappels where there are two eminent Voices.
My End and Hopes are the Promotion of the Divine Use of MUSICK, To the Honour of HIM whose Gift it is to Mankind to Sing HIS Praises here on Earth, that they may Hereafter Sing Eternal HALLELUJAH's with the Blessed Saints and Angels in Everlasting Glory,
