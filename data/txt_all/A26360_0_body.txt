SIR,
I Have ever had a peculiar esteem for all such Dis∣courses, as Peaceably tend to beget in Mens Hearts a right knowledge of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Which I look upon as the highest My∣stery in Religion, and the best Instrument to convey Vertue, and promote it in a Christians Soul.
And seeing the small Piece you sent to be perused by me,
 is designed to instruct the younger sort (who are the hopes of the Church) in such Princi∣ples of Christianity, as are ne∣cessary to be known by them, before they be admitted to the Holy Communion, you may well presume not only of my Approbation, but ear∣nest Desire, to have it made Publick.
