SIRS;
IT cannot be unseasonable in a time of so great Wan∣dring from, to treate of Walking with God. A Walk here is, that bodily Infirmitie disables not from, and the more a man do's stirre in it, and the more he may; other Walks you may have observed with their seats at the end, and concerning this I may boldly say, Walk with God, and Rest with Him. You have hereto∣fore in some measure, received, how
yee ought to walk, and to please God, and Note, I put you in re∣membrance of these Things; Let your Eye take at your Eare, and your Heart at both, and your life at all; for what is my hope, or joy, or Crown of rejoycing? Are not yee in the presence of our Lord Je∣sus Christ at His Coming? Yee are the glory and joy of,
Sirs,
