PArdon sweet Prince, pardon my bold present;
The Hope we haue your Excellencie shall
Proue to our Church, a matchlesse Instrument,
For Gospels good, and Superstitions fall:
That, and some Grace, vouchsafed to my bands,
Emboldens mee, to giue this to your hands.


Some scandalized haue my Christian Fayth,
That so hood-winked Maiestrates may bee:
Though skils not much, what Papal-mynor saith
Yet duety mine, to cause hood-wink't to see:
This may reproue such fore-heads as be flinted,
my faith b'ing such, as Scotland somtimes printed.


Yea,Priuiledged by our King. An. 1595. & 96. England's state haue licensed the same,
The selfesame faith sparsed throuhgout my bookes
Which here I properly An Abstract name,
And vnto Moses for the tryall lookes:
The methode hath my prisond-sense for mensure,
But read sweet Prince, & then giue out your senâˆ£sure.
