My Lord,
I Should not know how to Apolo∣gize
for the Presumption of this
Address, if the Introduction of
a Forreigner did not in some
wise plead in my Excuse. His Privi∣ledges,
as such, in a great manner
entituling him to your Lordship's
Protection, I resolv'd, at the same
time I implor'd his Admittance, to
improve the Occasion, as well for the
discharging some awful sense of Grati∣tude,
for the Obligations I have to
your Illustrious Father, as for the pay∣ing
your Lordship that Homage that
is owing you from all those that make
Profession of publickly honouring Me∣rit
and Virtue. Yes, my Lord, as
the World does both Esteem and
Admire the ravishing Excellencies of
your Person, the surprizing Progress
you have made in all sorts of Noble
Exercises, that Blooming Beauty of

your Genius, that Vivacity of Ima∣gination,
Solidity of Judgment,
those Charms in Conversation, and
that early Harvest of Polite Learning
that so soon in your Spring your
Lordship stands possess'd of; as if the
Muses had a Mind to make some A∣mends
by shedding all their Gifts up∣on
your Lordship, for the constant
support and azylum they have ever
found in your illustrious Family: So
it has a Respect and Veneration for
your Goodness, your Condescention,
Generosity, Candour, and Gallantry,
that conspicuously declares the Nobi∣lity
of your Extraction. Thus I hope
this Offering will not only be inter∣preted,
as an Effect of my Zeal and
Admiration, but as a Testimony of the
ardent and respectful Passion, with
which I am,
My Lord,
