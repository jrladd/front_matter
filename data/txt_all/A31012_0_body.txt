SIR,
I Hope You will not be surpriz'd, when You find your Name set before the following Discourse. As it was Preach'd at your Request, so I think I have no reason to doubt of Your favourable Ac∣ceptance of it; especially since I know You are perswaded, that the Doctrines contain'd in it, are both sound and seasonable.
The Charitable Settlements which You have already made, are a sufficient Argument, that You firmly believe Good Works to be absolutely ne∣cessary to Salvation; and Your very earnest De∣sire of perfecting Your more noble Designs, not∣withstanding the Discouragements You have met with, farther shew, that You look upon the time of Life to be the most proper, if not the only time of doing good.
As far as I remember, I have never seen any just Discourse on this Subject; and I heartily wish, what I have here said, may answer my chief design in the Publication of it, which is, that I may convince Men of Ability of the dan∣ger of delaying their Charity till they dye. If I should not be so happy as to succeed herein, it will yet be a great satisfaction to me to consider, that I have so fair an opportunity of acknowledging Your generous Kindness to me, and of assuring You withal, that I am,
Honour'd SIR, 
Ball. Coll. Oxford
July 11. 1699.
