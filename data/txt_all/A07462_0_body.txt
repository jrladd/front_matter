THe Christians, (VVoorshypfull Syr) which vse to trauayle toward Ierusalem. And also the Mahomettes, which wan∣der toward theyr holy place Mecha, which is the buryall plotte of theyr Aduocate and false Prophete Maho∣met: Vse to carrie with them Scrips for their prouision of victualles, and other furniture. And where those Pilgrymes carry seuerally but one: in my Perigrination, I carried two, the one for my victuals, and the other to keepe such bookes as were giuen me b he way for charitie.

And now of late I chaunced to turne ouer my Papers, amonge the which I found this little Dialogue, concer∣ning Phisick and Phisitions, writtē in the Castlyn tongue by a learned Gen∣tleman, called Pedro Mexia, who sometime was Chronicler to the late Emperour Charles the fifth. And then calling to memory the varietie of mans inclynacion, how some are en∣clined and haue delight to refresh we∣rinesse, in reading & conferring with notable writers, other some haue great pleasure in comfortable Mu∣sick, and others in the conuersation of faithfull and louing freends.
And where I am certayne that your recreation is often times among bookes, and especially in reading of trauailers woorks, as well by land as Sea. Yea and your owne person, ha∣uing passed the Occean Sea. I may boldly say with no great pleasure: yet your Woorshippe dooth not repent

you thereof.
I therfore am now the more bolder to offer this little pamphlet vnto you. Praying your woorship to accept the small gift, and to remember the poore olde woman who offered two mites▪ her gift was small, but yet with an exceeding good hart and will, and the Almightie graunt your gentle hartes desire.
