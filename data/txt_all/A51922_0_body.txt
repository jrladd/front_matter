SIR,
THe workes of Royall Authors are
onely fit to bee lodged in noble
hands, to whom then more justly
could I devote this service then
unto YOU to whom all learning owes for a
Patron, and the world for an Example.
This is that which hath invited me to
this Dedication, besides an ambition which

a long time I have nourished that poynteth at
no other happines then to study out some
way to make my selfe knowne unto YOU,
and if my devotion to your service can
winne on your goodnesse to pardon my preâˆ£sumption
the glorious endowments of this
most illustrious Lady (who in her time was
one of the greatest Princesses of Europe) shall
winne on your Iudgemeut to entertaine this
everlasting Issue and MEMORIALL of
her, in which there is no other errour to be
found but that it is presented to the world
and you by this rude hand
Sir,
