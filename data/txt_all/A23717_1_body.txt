My LORD,
TO vouch your Lordships
commands for the publish∣ing
this Discourse, I might
reasonably think, would
be to libel your judgment; and
the prefixing your Name to
it, and this mean address,
would look rather like revenge than homage
or obedience: If I did not know that low per∣formances
are due to the transcendency of
such a subject as I then discours'd upon,

and such a Patron as I now Dedicate to:
So I lie prostrate under my great Arguments,
here insufficiency is Art and Rhetorick. And
the truth is, My Lord, it was not this
which made me so sollicitous to avoid
your injunctions, but apprehensions of the
unusefulness of the Discourse it self.
When God's most signal methods of all
sorts do not seem to have wrought much
conviction; when neither our own dismal
guilts, nor miseries, nor most express
miracles of deliverance have made us sen∣sible,
but after the equally stupendous
Thirtieth of January and Twenty Ninth of
May, and the black time that interven'd;
we are still the same perverse untractable peo∣ple;
when luxury is the retribution made
for plenty, license for liberty, and Atheism for
Religion, whil'st miracles of mercy are acknow∣ledged
only by prodigies of ingrateful disobe∣dience:
And on the other side, when factious
humours swell against all Laws, as they
would either over-flow those mounds, or
make them yield and give way to them; when
Declarations and Decrees, which infallible when
they came only from a party of a part of
a Parliament, are neither of force nor esteem
when they have all solemnity and obligation
that just and full authority can give; alas,
what hopes of doing any thing can a
weak Harangue entertain? But, My Lord,

since you are pleas'd to Command, I
give up both it and my understanding to
Your Lordship, and the weaker the Dis∣course
is, so much the more pregnant
testimony is it of the obsequiousness of.
My Lord,
