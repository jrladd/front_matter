MY LORD,
THat which enduced me to present your EXCELLENCY with this short Narra∣tive of my Services, Sufferings, and Dis∣bursements for this Nation, proceedeth nei∣ther from the vanity to magnifie my owne actions (being hardly worth the mentioning before your Ex∣cellency) Nor from any pressing necessity of your pitty; or a present desire to be re-imbursed, though I do very much need both your compassion & assistance: but the same principles of Reason, Honour, and Justice, (that obliged my primitive en∣gagement with the first for this Nation in generall, for de∣fence of its Lawes and Liberties) calling upon me to make some sure provision, that after my long and faithfull service, travells and endeavours for the publique Weale, I my selfe might not lye under a causelesse calumny, doth necessitate this my humble application to your Excellency, to the end that (my cause being fully knowne) I might not be rendered un∣capable of an owning from your Excellency, and all good men that have acted though in a higher station) on the same account.
I have onely hinted herein at what I have suffered in that kind, without recrimination, and am really as free from dis∣content thereby, as those who in reward of their endeavours have received greater encouragement; and if your Excel∣lency shall daigne to consider the ensuing Narrative; and upon due consideration thereof upon principles of reason, in
your owne judgement conclude me a lover of my Country, I shall esteeme my selfe no loser, by all those hazards, services, and expences I have undergone, upon the account of the Publique, it having heitherto (through mercy) been alwaies by me a conclusive satisfaction, that the dispensation of Di∣vine Providence, had or did hand them out to me as a suffi∣cient patrimony.
My Lord, The assurance that I have of your Excellencies love to Justice, and enlarged affections frequently evidenced to such as have been faithful, together with the inward peace I par∣take as having done all things singly, with Zeale, fervour, and faithfulnesse, hath created in me an exceeding confi∣dence that neither my person can any way want encourage∣ment, nor my cause consideration, while my selfe and it re∣maine under the protection of your Excellency; to whom I in all humility make my appeale, as depending on your ju∣stice (thereto encouraged by former favours) I shall with the greatest assurance depend; being with all thankfulnesse de∣voted
My Lord,
