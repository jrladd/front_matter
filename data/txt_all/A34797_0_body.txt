AFter long deliberation, I hardly induced my self to crave your gracious protection towards this simple work: va∣luing it at so low a price, as I think it hardly worth the respect of any grave man, much lesse the favourable aspect of so honourable a personage. Yet the remem∣brance of those your Fatherly provocations, whereby, at my coming to your Grace from the University, you first put me upon these studies, at the last, by a kind of necessity, inforced me to this attempt; because I could not see how well to avoid it, but by adventuring the hatefull note of unthankfulness. For I cannot without dissimulation, but confesse my self perswaded, that this poor Pamphlet may prove profitable to the young Students of both Laws, to whose advancement that way, I have of late addict∣ed mine endeavours; else were I more than mad to offer it to the world: and to offer it without mention of him, that by occasioning of this good, more or less, deserveth the prime thanks, were to prove my self unworthy of so grave ad∣vice.
And therefore howsoever I account this too much boldness in respect of the subject: yet could I be exceedingly glad it might please your Grace to ascribe mine intention to the integrity of my duty. For he that meaneth truly well, and cannot perform much, must needs rejoyce at the good acceptance of that little which he performeth.
All I crave, for this at your Graces hands, is patience and pardon for this en∣terprise, with the continuance of those your many favours, that hitherto to my great comfort I have enjoyed. And so my long observation of your judicious dis∣position, having taught me, what small delight you take in affected complements, and verbal commendation, without more words, In all true humblenesse, I be∣seech the Almighty long to continue your Grace in health and prosperity, to his glory, and the good of his Church.
