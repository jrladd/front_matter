Gentlemen,
'TIS to You I recommend this small Treatise, of plain, easie, and profitable Politicks; 'tis to You alone I dedicate it, and it was for your Sake, and the Service of my dear and entirely-belov'd Country, I have engag'd my Pen, and appear in Publick at this time, when we have something else to do, than to write or publish Books: News is now the only Theme, and by it's Noise drowns all other Talk; the French the Spani∣ards, the Savoyards, the Dutch, the English, France, Flanders, Catalonia, Italy, and the Rhine, employ all our Tongues, and almost our very Thoughts too. The Sea and the Land-Services give full Employments to, and Enter∣tainment for our Noddles; the Coffee-Houses are cramm'd, the Exchange crouded, all the cry is News, the Streets echo nothing else; the Town is diverted, and so is the Country too! After this manner, the Bath, Astrop, Tun∣bridge, and Epsom, all filled with Inquirers of this kind. Quelle Novelle? is now the Salutation. The Ladies are in too, they attend the News with impatience, the Post is
too slow, and the Wind too calm, and too contrary, to hin∣der the Packet-Boats return, and to detain them so long on that side. Nay, the Fair Sex are become most exquisite Geo∣graphers, and can give an Account where Cales and Cata∣lonia are, where Cazal and Pignerol, as well as most Men; they can hardly attend the mutation of their Modes; and, as a Witty one among them said, when ask'd why the Fashion continu'd so long, and with so little alteration? Truly the French, the usual Fashion-Mongers of Europe, were now otherways employed. The strong Stream, and chief Current being now wholly bent upon News, what hopes can a new Author have of being handled or read? Oh, there's time and leisure enough for that, in the intervals of News and Business; besides, now the Summer is past, and the Au∣tumn and short Days with long Nights approach; the Town will suddenly fill, the Men of Business will haste hi∣ther, Soldiers, States-men, Scholars, Merchants, all come here, this is the Rendezvous, the Winter-Quarters; then the Word will be, What new Books have been lately prin∣ted? The Answer return'd, but few, Trading is dead, Pa∣per and Printing dear, and Money very scarce, and bad in∣to the Bargain, sad Times indeed! But, pray when were we without Complaints and Murmurings? And, tho' they may generally have Reason now, I hope they had the less then, in those glorious Days of Peace and Plenty; but there always was, and ever will be Repiners, none Rich or Great enough, not content with their State and Condition, always uneasie, never satisfied or long pleas'd. But here, lo here's a Piece of Politicks, not drawn from Cabinet or Co∣py of the great Richelieu, or greater Mazerine, no nor from the Florentine Secretary: Here are no Politicks laid to encrease, but to conserve Empire; not to make new Con∣quests, but to secure old Ones; not to invade and destroy
our Neighbours Dominions, but to permit them peacefully to enjoy them; not to subvert, but to preserve a Kingdom; not to depopulate, but to well-people an Island; happy in it self, the happiest in the World, surrounded with Salt-Water, environ'd with floating Bulwarks, invincible in the Courage of the Men, and renown'd for the Beauty of the Women; but, above all, fam'd for the Mildness and Lenity of its Government; no Absolute and Arbitrary Treatments here; all bounded by Laws, Prerogative, and Privilege, have their Limits, their ne plus ultra: Noble and sweet Constitutions, no Wooden Shooes, no Dragoons, no Gallies, no Stat pro Ratione voluntas, no sic Volo, sic Jubeo, but the King Commands with Sweetness and Gentleness, and Rules by Law; and the Subjects Obey with Cheerfulness, Duty, and Affection. And, tho' we are not for changing all, yet we are for mending some of our Laws, which will apparently tend to the Publick Good; and for that very Reason will freely admit of some Alteration, and preserve our People, much exhausted by Wars, and other Means.
Gentlemen,
As I told You at the beginning of my Dedication, so I now confirm to You, 'tis to You alone I write, no Jacks, no Haters of their Native Country, no Lovers of Lewis the Fourteenth, with his Mahumetan League; but to the Lo∣vers of WILLIAM the Third, who Wish, Talk and Fight for the Prosperity of Old England; You merit my Services, my Pains are Your due; indeed You deserve my best Endeavours, You shall have more, You bear a true Love to your own Country, You are an Honour to it; and the poor, sneaking, whining Jacks a Shame, Scandal, and Discredit to it: They are Vipers, Monsters, unnatural Births; they en∣feeble, but You strengthen the Hands of the Government,
to carry on the sharpest, bloodiest, and most expensive War that ever Britain was engag'd in; or, after this, I hope, ever will be: You bravely stand by your King and Country; some with your Swords in your Hands; others with your Purses, full, drawn, and wide open, to defend our Native Land, our Darling Religion, and our Civil Rights: Alas! our Liberty is above Price, beyond Value. And, as for those silly and contemptible Wretches, that whine and bawl, and seem to long for French Government, or King James's, which would be much at one, for he copied exactly after the Versalian Original; he set up too soon for Omnipotent, he had not serv'd seven Years, his Apprentiship, to his Ma∣ster King Lewis; besides, he run too fast, was soon out of Breath, he was too hasty, too fleet to hold long, and his Horse was resty. Alas! the People of England are not Beasts of Burthen, Asses to be rid upon; let the Romish Priests find out their Men of Patience and Flegm in other Countries, with easie flat Backs, and tame servile Tem∣pers; they were mistaken in their Men, the English are too mettlesome to be Slaves, they have not been used to Servitude, and cannot endure it, they'll kick and wince, and fling their Rider, as they did their late King: No∣thing but Quo Warranto's and Mandamus's; the King will have it, I'll make ye know I am your King; as he told the Fellows of a certain College; tho', as it fell out, they did not know him very long: 'Tis dangerous to violate and break in upon Establishments, it has ever been fatal to the Aggressors: Charles II. of England, that begun that Work, had like to have been unhors'd, the Times were violent, and had like to have broke out into Civil (as they call them, tho' I think they are Rude) Commotions: Lucan the Phar∣salian Poet calls them Plusquam Civilia Bella; and, I think, he is in the Right.

My Tenderness to my Country-Men has brought forth this little Piece; 'tis the Genuine Issue of a plain, honest, and innocent Noddle: I have often with Compassion and Humanity beheld Numbers of likely, able, and comely Men and Women ride up Holborn-Hill alive in Carts, who ne∣ver came that way gain alive; I have pitied them from my very Heart, and wish'd it in my Power to mitigate their Doom, to change their rigid Fate; to spare their Lives, and punish their Carkasses by Confinement and Labour; which would most effectually reduce them: I am not for that violent Quack-Physick, which Cures all Diseases: Ketch is a cruel hard-hearted Doctor, kills all his Patients, and, like other Physicians, by Law forsooth. If it should be alledged, That the Conservators of our Liberty are too tender of it, to take it away from us by such Methods as these; it may be answer'd, That what they do, we do, and consent to it by them who represent us, and who sit there by our Breath; I mean in St. Stephen's Chapel, for 'twas our Votes sent them thither, we are the Electors; and tho' they are not oblig'd, as the States-Deputies in Holland, to go home, and consult with their Principals, being vested with an unlimited Power, yet so much in Reason and Ju∣stice we may expect from them, to receive an humble Proposal from their Fellow-Subjects, and to consider upon the vast Advantages that will accrue to the Kingdom, by putting this very Thing into Practice; ever reflecting how easie 'tis to destroy, but how impossible 'tis to retrieve Life. The Romans, whom all the World will allow to have been a gallant, victorious, and wise People, were always very ten∣der of their Citizens and Subjects, ever preserving their Lives with due regard; well knowing, that in them con∣sisted the Glory and Safety of their mighty Commonwealth. We need not be asham'd to take Pattern by them, 'tis from
their Prudent Practices I have collected some of my Noti∣ons, which I have enforc'd with the best Arguments I am Master of; and, which I am sure will go down with all sen∣sible Men, and for the rest I don't value at the Price of a Prune; I write not to, or for them, away with their pro∣phane Hands, and empty Heads; I'll not take Pains to make them Wiser; 'tis cleansing the Augean Stable; I'll send for old Hercules to undertake them, I am not Fleg∣matick enough for that Service; besides, 'tis too difficult a Province for me to undertake, and therefore I shall de∣sist.
And now to wind up my Bottoms, I shall detain You no longer from looking into the Book it self, where, I question not but You will meet with an ample and entire Satisfaction, and joyn with me, in your good Wishes, and use your best Endeavours to have these Matters brought about. We have a King that will Concur in any thing for the Good of the Nation; and so great a Lover He is of the Honest, Loyal English, that He desires not the Death of one of them, no not of those ingrateful Plotters and Conspirators against His Person, and Government; to whom He has shew'd a Cle∣mency never sufficiently to be prais'd, being beyond all Ex∣ample.
