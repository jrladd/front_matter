Most Glorious Saint,
BEING to publish thy Blessed Life, traslated into En∣glish for the publik benefit of our Coūtry; I found no creature heere on Earth, see∣ming worthy inough, to be presented therewith, by way of Dedication: And therfore, were my Thoughts present∣ly, transported hence to the glorious Cittizens of Heauen; whither ariuing, they forth∣with made choice of thy Bles∣sed

Selfe, as best (& in particu∣ler) deseruing so true an Ho∣nour.
Accept then (B. Saint) this my small labour which in all Humility & Reuerence I heere offer vnto thy Holy NAME, togeather with my vnworthy Selfe; that by thy Intercession, & Piety, I may be made par∣taker of some little glimpse of that spiritual Influence, which out of the huge Masse of thy Glorious merits, thou vouchsa∣fest to impart vnto thy deuout Suppliants; amongst whom I humbly begge (O Glorious Virgin) to be accepted for one.
