May it please your Grace:
I Humbly present you this Tract of Religi∣on and Policy, wher∣in I acknowledge the disproportion be∣tweene the matter and the manner I giue it. Yet because it is a seruice of due∣ty, it may therefore please your Grace to accept it.
The reason of my vndertaking it, is the duety of Christian conscience, which bindeth every man to some pro∣fitable

performance. And because God hath not yet beene pleased to giue me particular place of seruice, where∣in I might imploy his talent with more aduantage, I (therefore) endeauour my selfe in such trauell wherein God may receiue his part of honour, his ser∣uants their parts of profit, and my selfe the discharge of Christian duetie, all which respects are the lawes & restricti∣ons of euery lawfull worke.
The reason of dedication is the re∣uerence your Grace doth merit from all them, who professe learning. In which number, though I be the meanest (in respect both of Nature and Fortune) yet beeing bound with others, I (like them) both declare and direct my selfe to your Grace in my labours of best per∣formance.
Againe, the fitnes of your place with this argument, doth challenge the dedi∣cation, because the execution of your high calling, is a continuall exercise of

Religion and Religious Policy; the wea∣pons and prouident armour whereby both Church and State are secured from vngodly practise: the which (as your Grace best knoweth) hath bin that mur∣thering gun-shot bent against the truth of Religion, and the peace of Christian States.
For these respects I haue both writ, and giuen this trauell to your Grace, humbly acknowledging my duety, and the meanenesse of my deseruing.
