LOoke as the LILLY doth each Flower excell,
In Milke-white Lustre, and in Purple Dy:
So in your Heauenly Face, combined dwell
Pure spotlesse Candor, Roseat Modesty:
Fame, take thy Golden Trumpe, and her proclaime,
DIANA'S IEVVELL; Glory of her Name.










WIt's, Honor's, Beautie's Angelized Frames,
Vertue's faire Temples, Wonders of your Names,
Which gild that Climate with your Glorious Beames,
Beyond the Lustre of Starres twinckling gleames;
Crowne with your Fauors these Diuiner Laies,
Which tune your Soules to sound your Makers Praise:
So may you shine more bright in true renowne,
Than Golden Starres in Ariadne's Crowne.
