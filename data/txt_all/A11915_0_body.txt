IF cōsideration of your graces goodnes toward vs all your louing sub∣iectes whych flyeng fame by mowthes of men resowndes had not fully in me repressed al dreade of reprehension (Most noble princesse and my drad soueraigne Lady) If the wisdome that God at these yeres in your highnes hath planted, had not seemde to me a strong defence against all byt of shameles arrogāce (reproche wherof flong with disdain∣full wordes from ireful tōgues, as adders stinges

should strike me) fynally if the learning with which GOD hath endued your maiesye had not ben to me a comfortable perswasion of your gracious fauour towarde the simple gift and dutie of a scholer, I would not haue incurred so daungerous note of presumption, in attemp∣ting a subiect to hys princesse, a simple scholer to so excellently learned, a rashe yong man to so noble a Queene by none other signe to signifie allegeance and dutie toward your highnes saue by writing: when oft times is the pen the onely accuser in some pointes of hym that therwith doth endite. But now, to si (most gracious Lady) that thing come to passe which to the honour of him and for the welth of vs god hath ordained, a Princesse to raigne ouer vs, such one, to whom great fredome is for vs to serue, what ioy may serue to triumphe at that blissefull day, or what should we spare with pen to preache abrode that inward gladnes of hart that floweth from the brestes of vs your most louing subiects? beseching god that it may please hym to graunt your grace long and prosperous gouernance of the imperyal crowne of Englande. Then well vnderstanding how greatly your highnes is delighted in the

swete sappe of fine and pure writers, I haue here presumed to offer vnto you such a simple new yeres gift as neither presenteth golde nor perle, but dutie & good will of a scholler, a piece of Seneca translated into Englishe which I the rather enterprise to giue to your highnes, as well for that I thought it should not be vnplea∣sant for your grace to se some part of so excellent an author in your owne tong (the reading of whom in laten I vnderstande delightes greatly your maiesty) as also for that none may be a bet¦ter iudge of my doinges herein, then who best vnderstandeth my author: and the authoritie of your graces fauour towarde thys my little worke, may be to measure defence and shield against the sting of reprehending tōgues. Which I most humbly beseching your highnes end with prayer to god to sende vs long the fruition of so excellent and gracious a Ladie.
