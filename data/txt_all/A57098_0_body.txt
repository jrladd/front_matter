SIR,
THe favours I have so frequently found from your continual kindness, is the occasion I have taken the Confidence to kiss your hand with this home∣ly Offer of my sincere Services. I know your Ingenuity will easily discover those im∣perfections which your Generosity will as quickly pardon. But lest they should come too fast, and fall too heavy upon your pati∣ence, be pleased to take this truth as an allay. That it was thought on, begun, and finished, in a fortnight: therefore unlike to appear so Correct, as in reasonable expectation a Play
should be, before it passes Stage-proof. I must confess it a great defect of Judgment in me, and expect to be accused of much ir∣rational Confidence, for committing this Mi∣nor to make its way through so large a Con∣gregation of Criticks, as appear in the per∣secution of all Plays. But tis with me, as with Animals, that boldly attempt swim∣ming, wanting reason to apprehend the wa∣ter fatal: So I (without fear of Censorious Lashes, which a wiser Man might have expected to be the Conclusion of such an Adventure) have plung'd my self unawares into a merciless Sea of Satyrists; which I fear will prove Fatal, if I find not protection under your Patronage.
Which is the humble request of,
Sir,
