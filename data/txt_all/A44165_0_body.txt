IN such an Age as this, when Notions and Speculati∣ons Eat up the Practice of Piety; when Noise and Clamour passes for Religion, Covetous Pinching for great Sobriety and Moderation, and Ʋnmerciful Se∣verity for the Critical Clinch of Justice; when Charity not only begins but always keeps at Home; and few are the Examples of a Generous and true Evangelick Spirit, Permit and Pardon me (Noble Sir) to make use of your Great Name to Patronize this mean Dis∣course upon the Good Samaritane, and Recommend to the World those Christian Doctrines, which the last Sundays Holy Gospel proclaimed to all good Men: Doctrines which enoble the Soul, and without the Prac∣tice of which Men cannot be Christians.
It's Truth and Plainness is its best Recommendation, and wellcom'd it to those Gentlemen who urged its Pub∣lication: and those qualifications will oblige true Church∣men: For, the Holy Gospel of the Blessed Jesus needs no flourishes, and when most naked is always most Rhetorical and Convincing.
And they to whom it was Preached are truly Devo∣ted to you, as you have been pleased highly to respect them; which that, Noble Benefaction to our Church, yet of General use and service to the publick, will prove a brave and lasting Monument of.
They are of the Number of those who have done themselves the Honour to Elect you their Magistrate: By which they have justified their Prudence, and exerted a bravery equal to the Ancient Romans; who taking good care to choose Wise and Noble Senators, secured their Liberties from all violence and alienation, main∣tained a glorious Magistracy to the enriching of their Fellow Citizens, and provided wonderfully for all their Poor and Distressed.
And thus you have already done, to the Honour of this great City, the Joy and Satisfaction of all good Men in it, and to the Comfort and Delivery of many Hun∣dreds of the Indigent and Imprisoned Members of it.
This was a true Year of Jubilee to them; and a beginning of a New Life, when they now can work for their maintenance without fear or disturbance; say their Prayers, and thank God for their Deliverance without hurry or frightful perplexity; and Contemplate Gods Mercy in raising them such a Benefactor, who has delivered them from the dire usage, that horrid dis∣cipline of Cruel and Imperious Jaylors.
And that thus it should be, that God in all Ages does raise up Men for the Eminent Care of his, his little ones, his Poor despised and afflicted Mem∣bers, is a most admirable proof of his Goodness, a great Argument and Instance of the Wisdom and Justice of his Providence.
It was perhaps the intendment of Almighty God in making such an In-equality in the outward Condition of Men in the World, that those of Fortune on the Right hand should take kind Notice of those on the Left; that so the Sick, Poor and Naked may not seem to be forgot by their Maker, when they are nourished by the Bountiful hand of those, whom he has enabled and given a Heart to do great things.
You have been in a most Eminent degree already a Noble Patriot of your Country; You have Fed and Clothed the Hungry and Naked; You have opened

Prison Doors, and released Captives of Ancient Date, You have been Physick to the Sick and a Cordial to the Faint; a Father to the Fatherless, Protection and Counsel to the Widow, and a Friend to all that you could have true opportunity to serve.
And here I must not omit that great part of your Character, (answering The good Samaritane,) which the World ought to know and value you for; That in your mighty Charities, you have not been like the Jews, to determine them to Party or Sect or Country: But, as God commanded, who himself makes the Sun to shine, and Rain fall on the Just and on the Unjust▪ And as Christ by way of example Practised, who Fed, Cured, and Relieved all manner of Miserable Men that came near him; so nor has any ever been denyed your Assistance and Relief (who was a true Object of your Charity,) because he was not of your Faith and Opinion.
And all this is doing what God commands; 'tis doing what Christ came into the World to teach Men to do; this is acting like wise Men and good Christians; 'tis doing more than Scribes and Pharisees.
Go on (Great Sir) who thus have devoted both your self and Estate to the true Interest of the Nation, the Service of this City, the Incouragement of Justice,

and support of the Poor, all which does tend to the Glory of God; Go on, to perfect these great Works of Mercy and Pity, of Justice and Generosity: And may you never want Power and Authority answerable to your Will and Ability, whereby these Great Works will be more easily and cheerfully finished.
The Members of a Wise Corporation have but the other day chosen You their Head and Patron; 'tis a place of Trust, and of Ancient State and Honour; And by their Election they have ensured to themselves a Valuable Protector, a Noble Friend, and Faith∣ful Governour.
And all Wise-Men who love their Country will follow their example, and omit no Opportunity of Ad∣vancing such Men to Places of Trust, Honour, and Authority, by which the Grandieur of their Re∣nowned City will best appear, the Citizens be most easily Govern'd, the Affairs most Prudently and Hon∣ourably managed, Generosity and Hospitality more Nobly maintain'd, and the Poor and Distressed Cherish∣ed and Provided for: So that Foreigners may again admire, and our own Natives Glory in the Resto∣ration of our own English Courage, Hospitality and Charity.
It has pleased God to Bless you with a better Pro∣portion of Health, since the Fateague of that great Office you have so Honourably and diligently perform'd: And, That you may long enjoy a Continuance of the same to enable you to be yet more Eminent in publick Stations; and having served your Gene∣ration to the Honour of the Rich, Comfort of the Poor, and good of all, for many Years, You may then be Translated to Receive your Reward in Heaven, is the Prayer of,
Most Honoured Sir,

August, 30. 1700.
