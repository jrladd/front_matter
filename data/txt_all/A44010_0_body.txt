SIR,
IF I pretended to compose a compleat trea∣tise upon this subject, I should not refuse those large recruites of reasons and au∣thorities, which offer themselves to serve in this cause, for God and man, Religion and Policy, Church and Common wealth, (a) against the blasphemous, desperate, and destructive opinion of fatall destiny. But as (b) mine aim, in the first discourse, was onely to presse home hose things in writing, which had been agitated between us by word of mouth, (a course much to be preferred be∣fore verball conferences, as being freer from passions and tergiversations, less subject to mistakes and misrelations, wherein paralogismes are more quickly detected, imperti∣nencies discovered, and confusion avoided.) So my pre∣sent intention is onely to vindicate that discourse, and toge∣ther with it, (c) those lights of the Schooles, who were never sleighted, but where they were not understood. How far I have performed it, I leave to the judicious and unpar∣tiall Reader, resting for mine own part well contented with this, that I have fatisfied my self.
