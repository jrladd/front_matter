Sir:
THis little but excellent tract
of Monsieur du Moulins
being giuen mee to translate
by your worthie brother
(who formerlie, as your Worship may re∣member,
did once set me aworke in the like
kinde vvith no ill successe) and being de∣sirous

to haue it patronized by some
good friend as the custome is, I soone
bethought mee how it might verie ac∣ceptablie
passe vnder your name, if
so it would please you to grace my poore
endeuour, which in all humblenes I glad∣lie
offer vp vnto you: first, as a thank∣full
remembrance of your manie charita∣ble
fauours towardes mee; and then as
an earnest of my willingnes to bee doing
as I am able.
The discourse of it selfe in the origi∣nall
is of worth enough to giue all good
men content, which loue Gods true Re∣ligion
together with the propogation and
increase thereof, and (as I hope) hath
receiued no greate soile or blemish by
passing through my handes.
It seemes it was intended by that fa∣mous
man the Authour, especiallie for
his owne countriemen of the Romish
Church: but alas who are so deafe as
they that will not heare, or blind like
them that will not see? Yet as hee saith
in the end of his discourse, that Ani∣mam
suam liberauit in case it worke

not amongst them his wished effect; So
likewise if it passe into English vnder your
auur, vous aurez aussi Monsieur ad∣ncè une
bonne oeuure. So trusting to
our Worships gentle acceptance, I cease
further to trouble you in your most
worthie employments for the
common good; and re∣maine,
