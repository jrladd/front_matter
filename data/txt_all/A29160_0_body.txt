Gentlemen,
THis discourse, as it was preached at your kind request, so it is now, however unfit for the general view, in compliance with your obliging importu∣nity, made publick: nor could I in ju∣stice refuse you the disposal of that, which was purposely composed for your entertain∣ment. The subject of it, Unity, is (Blessed be God) as fully exemplified in your Society, as in any Corporation through∣out the City; and therefore the motives to
it, which the following discourse offers, are rather to be taken for tacite com∣mendations of your laudable performance, than reflections or remembrancers for your omission of this Duty. That you may still continue eminently remarkable, for an intimate Ʋnion and agreement amongst yourselves, and influence others by your good Example, to the happy composing of all Divisions among them; shall be the constant hearty Prayer, of,
