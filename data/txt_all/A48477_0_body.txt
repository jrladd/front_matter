SIRS,
COnsidering our frequent Exhortations to the Peo∣ple, to come to the Holy Sacrament, the many Motives, and those especially from the benefits
we receive thereby, so often in∣culcated and press'd upon them; and above all, considering the example of You that are the chief and leading Men, whose Wisdom they justly value, and have recourse to in most of their Affairs: it cannot but seem exceeding strange, that our Com∣munions are so very thin. If we, at any time, desire them to give us a reason of their absence, they either decline the question; or, if we press it, they stop our mouth by saying they are not sit, and who will perswade them to eat and drink their own dam∣nation? And thus they satisfie themselves with that excuse which is indeed an aggravation of their fault. The very truth is this,
to the looser sort, the Sacra∣ment, as all Religion, is a thing indifferent, that I do not say, despised; to many of those who are well inclined, (by reason of their crude and indi∣gested notion of it) it seems a tremendous dreadful duty that they are afraid to assist in; and to others a mystery that is un∣intelligible: and thus the great∣est restraint of impiety, the strongest bond of Ʋniversal Love to God and man, is deplorably neglected, to the prejudice of Christianity, and the great de∣cay of Holiness. Wherefore to reform this grievous evil amongst us, (since the efficacy of Preach∣ing in Country Parishes, is some∣what hindred, by reason of the
inconstancy of our hearers, through the extremity of Weather, and other causes; and since such an effectual instruction of Fami∣lies, that are scattered in con∣siderable distances, and are continually employed in their affairs, is impracticable) I re∣solved with my self to digest the Nature, the Ends, the Bene∣fits, and preparation to the Holy Sacrament in as easie a method, as familiar a Style, and as suit∣able to my Preaching as I could; that all pretences of ignorance, fear, or unfitness, may be re∣mov'd for the time to come. And I humbly beg of you to fa∣vour the design, and joyn your influence upon the People, with my endeavours, that God may
be glorified, his Worship fre∣quented, and our Souls, and the Souls of those that are under our care, that have any relation to us, or dependance upon us, may be saved: which is the con∣stant Prayer and endeavour of
