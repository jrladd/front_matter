RIght worshipfull I haue here vndertaken a woorke, how profitable, I referre to the euent. And for that I had no better meanes then this to manifest my duetie I haue presumed to make your W. the patrone of my trauell: wherein if you shalbe plea∣sed to allow me your ordinarie fauour, it will be of force sufficient not onelye to defend me from the greatest aduersarie, but also to arme and encourage me to a worke of better effect. Thus as I haue pre∣sumed to commit vnto your W. this my first croppe, so will I in my best exercises commend all your actions to be gouerned by the Lord.
