May it Please Your Majesty,
ONE of the Principal Graces which it hath pleased Almighty God to shew me, in Preser∣ving me from so many Perils and Dangers that I have run through in

Travelling about the World, is this, To see my self at present at Your Majesty's Feet, offering, in all Hu∣mility and Obedience, This, my Wri∣tings, as the only Fruit which I have been able to Reap in my Long and Dangerous Travels. I know very well, that 'tis a thing which of its self is not worthy to be presented to Your Majesty. But should it please Your Majesty to consider, that the late King, Your Royal Father, of Glorious and Eternal Memory, did me formerly the Honour, to com∣mand me to undertake the most part of these Voyages, and to take pleasure in the Relations which I made to him thereof, at my Return; I dare pro∣mise my self, that Your Majesty (as you follow in all things the Generous Steps of the Greatest King, and Best Father that ever

was) will not also disdain to re∣ceive with Your wonted Goodness and Sweetness, this little Testimo∣ny of my most humble and most de∣vout Affection to Your Majesty's Ser∣vice; the which may encourage me to cause Your Majesty one Day to see (God willing) something of more Value, and to hope that, according to Your Royal Design, Your Majesty will give me Means to continue and per∣fect the Cabinet of Rarities which, by Your Command, I have began to erect in Your Majesty's Palace of the Thuilleries, an Enterprize so lau∣dable, that it merits to be reckoned amongst so many other Worthy Actions of Honour and Vertue, which render Your Majesty Glorious and Commen∣dable for ever: And in the mean time I will continue all the rest of my Life to pray to God,

That it would please him to aug∣ment more and more to Your Majesty, his Holy Graces and Benediction.
