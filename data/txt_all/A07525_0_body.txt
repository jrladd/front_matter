TO whom more properly may Art prefer
Works of this Nature, which are high, and rare,
(Fit to delight a Princes Eye and Eare)
Then to the hands of such a Worthy Paire?
Imagine this (mixt with delight and State,
Being then an entertainment for the Best)
Your Noble Nuptials comes to celebrate:
And though it fall short of the Day, and Feast
Of your most sacred and vnited Loues;
Let none say therefore it vntimely moues:
It can, I hope, come out of Season, neuer,
To finde your Ioyes New; as at first, for euer.
