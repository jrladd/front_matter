RIght Worshipfull: It fell out by Gods good prouidence, that at the last Assize at Ber∣rie, I was an eare-witnesse of the Dis∣couery of the most strange and cruell Mur∣ther that euer I read of: The Detection whereof, together with the most fayre and honourable car∣riage of the businesse, did so affect me: that I could not think my time better spent, then in taking notes of such speciall Passages as fell out therein. Which howsoeuer I then onely entended for my priuate vse, yet considering, that such wonderful works of God, are to be declared to po∣sterity: and being solicited by some Worthies of the Shire to that end: I thought it good to condiscend to their re∣quests with the soonest, the rather to preuent such flying and suspitious pamphlets, wherewith the world in such cases, is too much abused: and so informe the world in the right vse of such strange occurrents. Wherein if your Wor∣ships shall find ought that may reuiue in your memory, o

wonderfull a discouery, and shall stirre vp your affections to magnifie the prouidence of God herein: As I shall haue herein what I principally desire, so shall I not faile to take any other good occasion, to testifie my thankefulnesse vnto your Worships, as God shall offer the same: to whose gracious protection I doe most hartily commend you all,
