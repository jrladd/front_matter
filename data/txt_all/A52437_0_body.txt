Madam,
THE Esteem, wherewith your Ladyship honour'd my for∣mer writings, has at once obliged me to an high measure of Grati∣tude, and pointed me out a way of shewing it. For I was hence led to conclude, that if any thing of Mine could afford you Plea∣sure and Entertainment, when you had no other interest in it than in

the Common light of the Sun, much more would it be acceptable, if made yours by some peculiar Right and Property. The difference of advantage seeming to me much the same, as between taking a turn in a Common walk, and en∣joying the Retirements of one's own Private Garden.
One only Objection stood in my way. I was a little scrupulous whether the Oblation were wor∣thy the Altar, whether so mean a Performance could Strike the Tast, much more deserve the Pa∣tronage of a Person of such nice and refined Sense, and whom Na∣ture and your own unassisted Cu∣riosity have Conspired to accom∣plish beyond what the Present Age

can parallel, Or (unless your La∣dyship will be perswaded to be∣queath some Monument of your extraordinary Genius to the world) the Future will ever believe. This Consideration I confess, did a little arrest my Pen, till I con∣fronted it with another, that your Ladyship is as Eminent for Can∣dour and goodness, as for Parts and Ingenious Attainments, and that you have Mildness and Sweet∣ness enough to temper the Seve∣rity even of your own Iudgment.
These Madam, were the Con∣siderations that embolden'd me to entitle your Ladyship to this work. Concerning which (what∣ever faults it may be charged with) I have something to boast,

which I am sure all writers have not, that I make an Offering of that which is purely my Own. Which if your Ladyship please to accept, there will be much added both to the Happiness and to the Duty of
Madam,

All-souls Coll.
