HAil Mighty Charles! Joy of our Lives and Eyes:
Born and preserv'd, restor'd in wondrous wise!
At last take pity of a Glorious State,
Shook by the Malice, and the restless Hate,
Of Undermining Foes, and Treacherous Friends,
By diff'ring methods driving the same ends.
Papist and Presbyterian both combine,
And Sampsons flaming Foxes Tails conjoyn
To Rob thee of thy Crown, and to destroy,
With thee our Lives, Religion, Liberty.
Rome and Geneva, both strive to pull down
The Envi'd Mitre and Imperial Crown.
The Royal Martyr Charles, the Wise, the Just,
Commands you to forgive, but never trust.
Lose not your Friends in hopes your Foes to gain,
Eternal hates are reconcil'd in vain.
You are no longer safe than they want power,
No Monarch after that can Reign an hour.
Cherish you Friends if Scepters you will sway,
And Rule your Subjects many a happy day.
Defend that Faith which does defend your Crown,
Which Christ first taught, which all true Christians own:
Who teaches any other, comes from Hell;
The Dev'l first did, then taught men to Rebel.
Read all the rest in the late Rebel Scot,
There is enough to shew a second Plot.
The Banks are yet intire, 'tis not too late
To stop another Deluge o're the State.
Who his to morrow trusts for safety, may,
Before it comes be ruined by delay.
To speak bold truths Poets and Painters dare,
Believe them, Mighty Sir, Believe, Beware!
Nothing can save us from a dreadful Doom,
But what secures from Faction and from Rome.
FINIS.
