AS to the most compassionate in this generall
mourning (right Honourable) I dedicate
this Funerall Elegy to your gracious pro∣tection:
wishing with my soule, I might
haue had a more pleasing subiect, both for
my Pen, and your Patronage, but since the
Heauens haue giuen vs this cause it is a duty to entertaine
the occasion, and an vnswerable negligence to omit it; pit∣ty
it were that Pen should euer more cast inke, that would
not make the whitest paper mourne in so vniuersall a sor∣row:
To whom then may I so aptly consecrate these
Teares, as to your Honour? whose entire zeale to the
Prince liuing (as I am confident) equal'd the Best: so (I am
no lesse assured) your sorrow for his death hath exceeded
the most, and (if I may offencelesse speake it) contended
with the greatest. Accept, I intreate your Honour, this my
obliged duty to him, and euer acknowledged seruice to
you; wishing all future occurrences, to be true, and essen∣tiall
causes of your ioies: and this last, the last of your
Teares.
