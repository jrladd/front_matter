My Lord,
I First intended to haue dedicated this little Treatise of Israels re∣demption by Christ, to your truly noble Sister the late deceased Countesse of Pembrock, in token of my thankfulnesse for her conti∣nuall fauours shewed me euer since she and my Lord her husband pla∣ced me in Bewdly, where she first drew in her happie breath; which place of her birth is styled by an ancient Poet, Delitium rerum, bellus locus. To this your Hono∣rable Sister I may with the change of the last word apply the olde verse penned to the praise of the Empresse Matildis; Ortu magna, viro maior, ter maxima prole, Hic iacet Henrici, filia, sponsa, parens. She was the daughter of the truly noble, wise and religious Lord President of Wales Sir Henrie Sidney; Wise of the no∣bly spirited and religiously affected the late Lord Henry
 Earle of Pembrock of happie memory, whose zeale and sincere loue to the truth, appeared in his life and death, as the Bishop of Sarum told vs at his funerall; She was the mother of two great Lords and Peeres of this Realme, the Earles of Pembrock and Mountgomery; lastly, she was Sister to that valorous learned Knight Sir Philip Sidney, Delitiae mundi, shedding his blood for the de∣fence of the Gospell, Hunc tantum terris ostendent fata, nec vltra esse sinent; and Sister to you (my Lord) who haue so well deserued by your seruices of warre and of peace, of your country and neighbour states abroad, imi∣tating your noble Vncle the late Lord Robert Dudley Earle of Leicester, and far excelling the two Simons de Monte forti, long since Earles of the same place. Your noble Sister (if we respect the rare endowments of na∣ture art, learning humane and diuine, accompanied with a most heroicall spirit) doth adde a true lustre to all your Honours. Now that the Lord hath taken her away, I thought good to dedicate to your Honour this litle Book, treating of the vertue and efficacie of Christs death, and confuting the Vniuersall Redemption of the Arminians; humbly beseeching your Lordship in your noble Sisters stead to patronize it; which shall cause the Author e∣uer to pray for your inward and outward happinesse in Christ. And thus humbly taking my leaue, I shall still rest at
