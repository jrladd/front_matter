MY LORD,
ALthough perhaps in strictness of judg∣ing there is somewhat of Impertinen∣cy in such Addresses, yet Custome hath obtain'd licence for us Writers thus to ex∣press our acknowledgments of favours, and to give publick testimonies to the Deserts of excellent Persons: Your Lordship affords me plenty of subject for both these, and I hum∣bly crave your leave to use the Liberty that is

granted without ensure n such occasions, to declare part of my resentments of them.
There is nothing more substantial, or va∣luable in Greatness, than the power it gives to oblige; for by doing benefits we in some measure are like to Him, who is the Lover of Men, and causeth his Sun to shine upon the good, and upon the evil: Nor doth God Himself glory in the absoluteness of his Power, and uncontroulableness of his Soveraign Will, as he doth in the displays of his Goodness: This, my Lord, is the right, and honourable use of that Greatness he is pleased to vouch∣safe unto Men; and this is that which makes it amiable, and truly illustrious: Your Lord∣ship knows this, and are as much by Nature as by Judgment, formed to live according to such measures: And I think there was never Person of your Lordship's rank, whose gene∣ra fashion, and converfation was more suited to the sweetest and most obliging Rules of living: For besides that your natural Genius hath nothing aughty, or rough in it, nothing but what is modest, gentle, and agreeable, your Lordships whole deportment is so affable, and condescending, that the benignity of your tem∣per seems to strive for superiority over the greatness of your quality, which yet it no

way lessens, but illustrates. This is that which highly deserves, and commands the love, and venerations of all that have the honour, and happiness to know you: And you may justly challenge their devotion, and highest esteem upon all other accounts that can give a great. Person any title to them. For your immediate descent is from a long masculine line of great Nobles, and you are a Remainder of the illu∣strious Blood of the PLANTAGENETS. What your Family hath deserv'd from the Crown, the vast supplies afforded his late Ma∣jesty by that Loyal Mquess, your Grand-Fa∣ther, and the sufferings of your House for Him, do sufficiently declare to the World: But your Lordship hath no need that Argu∣ments of Honour, and respect should be fetht from your Progenitors; the highest are due to your personal Vertues; and that way o living whereby you give exaple to Men of quality, and shew, how Honour, and Interest is to be upheld. For you spend not your time, and Estate in the anities and Vices of the Town, but live to your Country, and in it, after a spd, and most honourable Fashion, ob∣serving he Magence and Charty of the an∣cient Nobility, with all the Decency, and Im∣prements of  Times. And perhaps your

L ay is one of the best Pns the A yie of a Regular greatness,  which gr is without vanity; and Nobleness with∣out Luxury, or Intemperance: Where we see a vast Family without noise, or confusion; and the greatest lenty, and freedom, without provoca∣tions to any Debauchery, or Disorder. So that your Lordship's cares, and thoughts are not taken up with the little designs that usually en∣tertain idle, or vainly imployed Men, but in the Service of your King, and Country, and conduct of your Affairs, with prudence and generosity; in which you not only serve the present Age, but provide for the future. And, my Lord, among the acknowledg∣ments that are due to your Vertues, I cannot but observe the care you te for the constant, daily Worship of God in your Family, accord∣ing to the Protestant Religion, profest by the Church of England, and the example your Lord∣ship gives by your own attendance on it. This is the frest Foundation of greatness, yea 'tis the Crown, and lustre of it: And when all other magnificence is in the dust, and is shrivel'd in∣to nothing, or at the best, into a cold, and faint remembrance, the effects of this will stay by us, and be our happiness for ever; And all other splendors, in comparison, are but

like the shining of ten wood to the Glorys of the Sun, and Stars. This also is the best fence and security to our present comforts and injoy∣ments, both in respect of that temperance and soety it produccth, and chiefly on the ac∣count of the blessing of the Supream Donor, who hath made it the promises of this Life, as well as of that which is to come: And therefore the wickedness of those that take Liberty from their Riches and worldly greatness, to defie God, and despise Religion, is as foolish and improvident, as 'tis monstrous and unreason∣able: and those brutish Men do not render themselves more hateful for their impiety, than they are despicable for their folly. But I need not say this to your Lordship, who are sensi∣ble of the absurdities, and malignity of this vice, and give not the least countenance, or incouragement to it by your practice; being cautious to abstain from all expressions, that grate on the Honour of God, as you are free from any that can give just offence unto Men: For your Lordship is none of those that shoot the arrows of bitter words, and set their mouths against the Heavens; but your discourse and conversation is adorn'd with that modesty and decency that becomes a great Nobleman, and a good Christian.

My Lord, I have not given you    just acknowledgments, with design to ∣fie or please your Lordship, I know I need your pardon for the trouble your modesty re∣ceives from them; but I have done it for the sake of others, because we live in an Age wherein there is scarcity of such examples. I know 'tis ufually indecent to commend Per∣sons to themselves; but the custome of Dedi∣cations will excuse this, which even severity and ill nature cannot impeach of flattery, or extravagance.
And as I owe this Testimony to the merits whereby you serve and oblige the Age, so I should acknowledg the Obligations your Lordship hath conferr'd on my self: but this will be a great duty, and business of my Life; for such empty expressions as these verbal ones, are very unsuitable returns for real and great favours; and if ever better acknow∣ledgments are in my power, I shall still re∣member what I owe your Lordship.
I now most humbly present you with a Collection of some Essays upon subjects of im∣portance. The design of them is to lay a foundation for a good habit of thoughts, both in Philosophy, and Theology. They were some of them written several years ago, and had trial

of the World in divers Editions: Now they come abroad together (with some things that are new) reduced to such an Order, as is most agreeable to my present judgment. I could have added much upon such fertile, and useful Arguments; but I am willing to believe, I have said enough for the capable and ingenious, and I doubt too much for others. If your Lordship shall pardon their imperfections, and accept of the devotion where-with they are offer'd you, it will be the greatest honour, and satisfaction to,
My Lord,
