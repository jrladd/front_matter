MOst worthy Sir, I do upon the wings of Fame,
Dedicat to you one of your worthy Name,
Iohn Elliot he who's called a valiant Lad,
He's Brother to Henry Elliot of Hare-wood;
It was into my dream he did appear to me,
For I into the Ale-house did him never see,
In Iasons Golden Fleece it's said he doth abound,
And now he is of late a Person much renown'd,
Therefore I him consecrat to thee,
And with happiness to you, and your Posterity,
Wishing to him when he his Sheep doth shear,
They may improve their Fleece four times a year,
For that man that hath store of Wool, and woolly Fleeces,
May when he please, have store of Gold, and Golden Pieces.
