SYR,
YOV may be∣hold heer a sensles Statue, made to the Life, but vvithout Life, till the Promethean Fire of your

vvell knovvn piercing Iudg∣ment gracing it, giue it a true subsistence. It hath a Mouth vvithout VVords, VVords vvithout Spirit, till you the Mecaenas, through your Ho∣nours gracious acceptation, af∣foard it strength & energy. As for the Heart, expressed in the pure Intentiō of this Addresse to your Honour, it is vvholy yours; nor needs the spoiles of feigned Deityes, to giue it breath, to make it more your ovvne, then novv it is. Or ra∣ther if you please, you haue heer tvvo nevv-borne Tvvins, put

forth thus naked as you see into the vvide VVorld, to shift for themselues; and like to be for∣lorne, vnles your Lordship, pittying their pouerty, take thē into your Honourable Patro∣nage, and safe Protection.
France hath had the hap∣pinesse to giue them their first birth; your Honour shall haue the trouble to afford them a se∣cōd: That to haue bred a Spirit able to conceiue and bring forth such issues; And your Lordship through your noble Fauour, to make them free Denizens of this Kingdome. Or lastly, to

speake more properly, I heer pre∣sent your Lordship vvith the Svveet Thoughts of Death, and Eternity, expressed in our tongue. Not to vndertake, to make that svveet vnto you, (vvhich othervvise vvere bit∣ter) vvho through a fayr prepa∣ration of a Christian and ver∣tuous life, haue confidence in∣ough to looke grim Death, in the face; and vvith good sere∣nity of conscience, to vvayt on Eternity: but rather that your Lordship, vvould please to commend the same to others of like quality, vvho follovving

the vogue of the allurements, pleasures, and delights of this vvorld, may haue need of such noble Reflections, as Monsieur de la Serre, Authour of this VVorke, vvell versed vvith people of that ranke, hath lear∣nedly, and piously shevved to this more free and dissolute age. So shall your Honour, do a charitable vvork of mercy, the vvorld be edified, and I vvell satisfied, to haue put to my hand.
