Gentlemen.
SInce your first most gracious reception of me, into so calm a harbour as Louth hath prov'd in the midst of the late so stormy times, you have still to this day, so conti∣nually
 with your favours, honoured and encouraged me in my endeavours, that I have ever held my self in duty bound both by private service, and publick acknowledgment, to make you, what possible returns of thanks I should by Providence be empow'red to. And this is the ground of this present con∣secration of this Treatise to your Names; for whose nume∣rous favours towards me, I have designed it as a monument of my thankefulness: which to express, this is the best, and indeed the only way that I have, or can hope for. And truly were it better, (even so good, as to seem worthy of your ac∣ceptance) you should have the best. And the best you well deserve to have, whose merits justly claim the all, of what is possible in any way of gratitude to be ever done by

Louth Schoole April 25th 1655
