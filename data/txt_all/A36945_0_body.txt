HEre is a Childe
of Chance, that
like another Mo∣ses
in a Wicker
Basket, was lately put to
Sea; and by the Hand of

Providence guided unto
this shore, as unto Pha∣raoh's
Daughter; by the
taking of a small Irish Py∣rate,
in which it was
found; and appearing a
Babe both promising, and
very beautiful, was re∣commended
unto me to
Nurse. Of what Birth it
is, I can give no certain
account; all that I can as∣sure
you of, is this, That
having perused it through,
some very knowing per∣sons
have affirmed, That

our Language is yet in∣riched
with nothing upon
this Subject equal unto it.
The Clothes that it was
wrapt in, say little to∣wards
the discovery of its
Parents; for it was direct∣ed
as a present unto Or∣mond,
the Titular Vice-Roy
of Ireland, from one
Walsingham; who though
he professes to have given
it this English Habit it
now wears, yet he is able
to name no Father for it:
Whether it be some other

nameless Author, as he
affirms, that first gave it
light, I must of necessity
leave that as doubtful as
I found it: And it is a
needless curiosity to en∣quire
further, since no
man is injured in that con∣cealment,
but the Author;
who it seems is well con∣tent
to loose the glory of
it. What value this Wal∣singham
sets upon it, you
may read in a part of his
Letter unto Ormond,
which I here insert.

YOur Excellency will
herewith receive a
peice, that if not too much
lessened in passing through,
and from the hand that
sends it, truly not unwor∣thy
the acceptance of so
great a Person. It is some
years since I first met with
it in a Manuscript, and in
a Foraign Language, when
I took so great a fancy to
it, That it hath ever since
been an inseparable Com∣panion,
a daily Manual

unto me: I have since that
time found it published in
Latine, but still as nameless
as at our first acquaintance.
The divulging of it, seri∣ously,
I did much lament,
and that for a twofold Rea∣son;
One was, to see it come
abroad so lamely, and so
much injured; another
was, to finde it divulged
at all: For surely, it is a
Tract not intended for the
unskilful palate of the
vulgar; and indeed, onely
meant, and fit for the wisest

souls, and the maturest,
and best tempered Judge∣ments.
And the most part
of men are either by nature
so depraved, that they
cannot forbear the practise
of those evils, that they
finde discoursed upon, onely
for their instruction; or
else so sand-blinde and igno∣rant,
that they must needs
be scandalized with, and
stumble at those Praecepts
which are here recommended
unto no mans practise, but
laid by the Authors skiful

hand, as necessary Sea-marks
upon the Shelfs of danger
and deceit; of which, the
Ocean of a Publique life,
God knows, is full. And
a little after he adds, In
this small Volume, you will
finde (my Lord) enchaced
skilfully together as preci∣ous
Iewels, the choicest
Precepts that Story and Ex∣perience
both together, have
produced for the instruction
of those that move within
the sphere of Business, and
the Court: It is a curious

Landskip, wherein that
great Territory, with all the
blemishes and beauties of
it, is all contracted to an
easie view: It is a perfect
Compass fitted to those Seas,
with Points adapted to eve∣ry
wind that blows there:
It is an exact Card, descri∣bing
all the Coast; and as
there is not a Rode, a Creek,
or Harbor, overpast in all
that Channel; so is there
not a Rock, a Flat, or Quick∣sand
that is omitted. But
surely it is done to keep us

from, and not to lead us to
those dangers, &c.
This, and more delivers
he in commendations of
it; and what he says, can∣not
but be of some Au∣thority
in the case: Since
upon enquiry I do finde,
That he is one, who
though very yong, in a
little time grew up under
the Wings and Favor of
the Lord Digby, to such
credit with the late King,
That he came to be admit∣ted

to the greatest Trusts;
and was prevented onely
by the fall of the Court
it self, from climbing
there unto an eminenter
height.
This much Reader I
thought fit to say for thy
satisfaction, and by way of
civility to him; contrary
to whose design I have
published this Treatise,
and until another Father
can be found for it, have
prefixt his name unto it,

under the Title of his
Manual.
Farewel.
