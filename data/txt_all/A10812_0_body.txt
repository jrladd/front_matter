RIght worshipfull: as I was in the time of your worshipfull father, for many great fauours bounden. so haue I euer deuoted my selfe and all my abilitie, to your wor∣ship, and all the rest of his wor∣shipfull progenie. Amongst all which, your selfe, whose vertues God hath regarded, and the Prince worthily respected: I haue in my chee∣fest thoughts sought, to acknowledge my dutie, and to manifest my zeale to that worshipfull house; from whence you proceed. And albeit, to mine owne know∣ledge, you haue beene a spectator of those things, wherewith I now make bolde to present you: yet thereby I haue thought to manifest my loue, and humbly beseech you, that you vouehsafe the accep∣tance thereof. (The rather) for that it concerneth the honours done by our King, vnto his most deere be∣loued brother: all which, your selfe being better

acquainted with, then many others; that by fostering it, your honoured name shall be had in acceptance, with many thousands of this realme, whose desues are great, to heare the truth of al these honourable en∣tertainements giuen and receiued. Thus humbly commending my selfe vnto your worships fauour, and humbly crauing pardon for my presumption, I cease from your further trouble, and and rest in all humble duty at your seruice.
