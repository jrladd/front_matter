SIR:
THe principiall Motiue, which Impelled mee to Conse∣crate the subsequent Trea∣tise vnto your Name, is the selfe same, which at the first Inuited mee to Penne it, and publish it to the be∣nefit of the well-disposed Reader; And that was my Zeale toward the Truth of Christian Faith; which is so depra∣ued in this Irreligious age by sundry sorts of Hae∣reticks, so dissembled by Newters, so derided by Atheists, so disturbed by Schismaticks, that we may say thereof, as our Sauiour spake of him∣selfe; The Foxes haue holes, and the Birdes of the Ayre haue nests, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to rest his head.

By Foxes, meane the Cunning Polititians of this Age, who can (howsoeuer the state of Religion standeth) Seruire Scenae, act their part according to the time; And the Birdes I doe vnderstand, The vaine, vnconstent, light, Professors of the Christian Faith, who were neither of them euer soundly seasoned with Religion, & the true know∣ledge of GOD, and therefore, they so basely esteeme thereof, as if it were a matter of Indiffe∣rence, what▪ or whether a man beleeue or not.
And these kinde of men abound in all places, and liue in greatest applause and high estimation, while the zealous Seruants of Christ who will not beare the defacing of the Faith by Haeresie, or the abusing thereof through Hipocrisie, are ex∣ploded as the outcasts, and off-scowring of the world.
Now sorasmuch as I haue obserued in you at all such times, wherin I haue conuersed with you, an affection to the knowledge of the Mysteries of Saluation, by your frequent Inquisitions, alway accompanied with a reuerend sobriety, which the Apostle requireth as the limits of a Christian mans knowledge, and also a zealous desire, that o∣ther should be quitted from Ignorance; I could not forbeare vpon the ioy of mine acquaintance with a Gentleman of your ranke and Eminency in these partes, so well affected in Religion, and so certaine a welwisher and Fauorite vnto Lear∣ning, where the first is derided, and the other despised, that the Church and Vniuersitie, may

both take vp the Lords complaint against the vn∣gratefull Iewes, and apply it vnto the greater part of the Inhabitants in these Coasts; I haue nouri∣shed and brought vp Children, and they haue rebel∣led against me.
I could not forbeare, I say, in consideration of the Praemises, to estifie my Loue and obseruance toward you, to Dedicate this Booke vnto your Name, and the rather, because, as I doubtedly beleeue, you are one of those, whose name God hath written in his Booke of Life.
For as I said before, that I penned it of a Zeale I doe beare vnto the Truth, so I doe dedicate it vnto you of a hearty affection I doe beare vnto you; because you doe feare the Lord, meditate in his Law, and haue respect vnto his Com∣mandements; Such a one (saith Dauid) shall not be Psal. 119. confounded.
Secondly, because I am inuited hereunto, by your Courteous humanity toward these my poore and vnworthy Labours, the which as I haue destinated vnto you, so you desire to Dedi∣cate them to CHRIST his Church; And there∣fore as the Daughter of Pharoh reputed Moses (whom she saued from the fury of the Floods) as her owne Sonne; So this Treatise shall iustly challenge you for its Father, by whose Christian zeale it was deliuered from obscuritie, and pro∣moted to call Israel out of Egypt; and let those Israelites who by this meanes, shall finde the com∣fort of their deliuerance, call vpon GOD for a

blessing, vpon you and your generation.
And now (worthy Sir) I beseech the Lord, who hath begunne this good worke in you, that hee will performe it vntill the day of IESVS CHRIST; and this I pray, that your Loue may abound, yet more and more in Knowledge, and in all Iudgement, that you may allow those thinges which are best, that you may be pure and without offence, vntill the day of Christ; to which end the Lord preserue you Constant, and zealous in the profession of the true Faith, that you may in the next life, receiue the Crown of Life, which Christ hath purchased, and promised vnto all those, who continue faithfull vnto the End.
