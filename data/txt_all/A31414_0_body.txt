MY LORD,
THAT I once more presume to give your Lordship the trouble of such an Address, is not from any confidence I have in the value of these Papers, but partly because I well know, that your Lord∣ships candor and charity will be ready to pardon the faults, and to cover the weaknesses of the Undertaking partly because I thought it very reasonable and decorous, there to offer the Remaining Portions, where I had con∣secrated the First-Fruits.


MY LORD,
You will here meet with Persons of your own Quality and Order, Men Great and Venerable, whose excellent Learning and exemplary Lives,
whose Piety and Patience, Zeal and Charity, So∣briety and Contempt of the World, rendred them the honour of their Times, and recommend them as incomparable Examples to Posterity. We may here see in more instances then one, the Episcopal Order immediately deriving it self from Apostolic hands: whereof, were not some men strangely biassed by Passion and Prejudice, there could be no shadow of dispute. For he that can read the Lives of Timothy and Titus, of Igna∣tius, Polycarp, &c. and yet fancy them to have been no more then meer Parish-Priests, that only superintended a little Congregation, must needs betray either prodigious Ignorance, or unreaso∣nable Partiality. Here also we may find what a mighty reverence these First and better Ages had for the Governours of the Church, and the Guides of Souls, no respects being then thought great enough. Wherein they acted agreeably not onely to the Rules of Christianity, but to the common sense of mankind. And indeed with what Honours and Dignities, what Rights and Revenues, what Priviledges and Immunities the Sacred Function has been invested in all Ages and Nations, as well the rude and barbarous, as the more polite and civilized Countries, I could abundantly shew, were it as proper to this place as it is necessary to the Age we live in. For we are fallen into the worst of Times, wherein men have been taught, by bad Principles and worse Practices, to despise the holy Order, and to level it with the meanest of the People. And this done not onely by profest Enemies (for then
we could have born it) but by pretended friends, who seem to have a high zeal for Religion and themselves. By which means the hands of evil men have been strengthened, and the designs of those sufficiently gratified, who 'tis like would rejoice at the ruine of us both. I confess that the Persons and Credit of the Regular Clergy should by some men be treated with Contempt and Scorn, is the less to be wondred at, when Reli∣gion it self is not secure from the rude and bold railleries of some, and the serious attempts of others, who gravely design to banish the awe of Religion, and the impressions of whatever is Di∣vine and Sacred out of the minds of men.
But, My Lord, It is not my design to enter∣tain your Lordship with an invective against the Iniquity of the Times. I had rather silently be∣wail them, and heartily pray for their reforma∣tion, that the best of Churches may prosper and flourish under the best of Princes. May Her Peace and Order be preserved inviolable, her Liturgy and Divine Offices universally complied with, Her Solemn Assemblies duly frequented, Her Canons and Constitutions observed and pra∣ctised! May Her Priests be cloathed with Righ∣teousness, and able by sound Doctrin both to Exhort and to Convince Gainsayers! May they be labo∣rious in their Ministeries, and be very highly esteemed in love, at least for their relation to God and their Works sake! May Her Governours diligently superintend the Flock of God, and they that rule well, be accounted worthy of double Ho∣nour! In which number may your Lordship
share a double portion! May you fill up all the measures of a wise and able Counsellour in the State, and of a faithful and vigilant Gover∣nour in the Church! To all which great and holy ends, if the following Papers (wherein these things are represented in lively instances) may be capable of contributing any assistance, and in the least measure serviceable to retrive the Pri∣mitive temper and spirit of Religion, it will be thought an invaluable compensation of the mean endeavours of

MY LORD,
