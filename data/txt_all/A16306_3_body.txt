RIght worthy Citizens, you shal not for
this worke finde your honest seruants
the lesse seruiceable, but the more.
For, in good bloods, and good naâˆ£tures,
praise, and honor preuaile aboue rigour and
blowes. And because your selues, for the most
part, were Apprentises once, you may therefore
behold herein, with comfort, the honesty of your
estate when you were such, and the splendour of
what you are now in right. The vnthankefull
(if any such should happen to rankle among you)
may be warn'd; that the iuyce of Ingratitude doth
forfeit libertie, and that they are truly bondmen;
if not according to the letter, nor in their proper
condition, yet according to the figuratiue sense,
and in their improper basenesse.
VALETE.
