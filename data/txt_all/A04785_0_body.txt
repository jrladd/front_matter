PLato (Right Honorable) lear∣nedly, (I might say Deuinely) wrote, that men were not borne (only) for them selues, but for their Countrie, their parents, and friendes. The Stoikes in his time held, that all thinges that were created, had their being for mans vse. Men (a∣lone) were begotten, to be mutuall helps each to o∣ther. The Romanes when their estate most florished, accompted him amongst the number of the infor∣tunate, that during his life did not manifest (in some one publique benefite or other) his affection and thankefull heat, to the place wherein he first brea∣thed, insomuch as Marcus Otho the Emperour, and Marcus Curtius a Romane Knight, aswell to free

them selues from the mallconceiued opinion of the people, as to make knowne to the world, that they were their countries deuoted friends and welwil∣lers, willingly and voluntarily thrust them selues into ineuitable dangers, in which they offred the sa∣crifice of their liues for the safetie of their Countrie, and finished their sorowfull tragedies with the gene∣rall applause and admiration of all men. If these Heathens (hauing none but nature for their guide) proceeded so farre in such exceeding loue and zeale towards their Countrie, as they preferred the tran∣quillitie and peace thereof, before their priuat com∣modities, liberties, and liues, how iustly may they condemne vs (that challenge the name of Christi∣ans) since our good actions and endeuors want waight to ballance downe theirs. But it is no mar∣uell, for in this declining and dotage of the world, the most part of men are prone to follow their owne preferments, delighting in selfe-loue, and greedely snatching at the toppe of fickle fortunes wheele, (wherein the worlds summum bonum is fixt) which with the least touch ouerturnes, laying the heedles climer in the dust, as they haue greater regard and respect vnto their priuate proffit and aduancement (be it neuer so worthlesse) wherein they fondly distrust the prouidence of God, then to the good of their countrie (how necessarily soeuer it require their helpe) wherein they shewe their neglect of dtie, and stayne them selues with the filth of ingra∣titude, then which nothing (in a reasonable crea∣ture)

can be more faultie, for creatures vnreasonable naturally abhorre it. The consideration whereof, hath animated me (amongst many thousands the vnworthiest) in this dangerous time of sicknesse (not vnlikely to proue more dangerous, the worst season of the yeare approching) wherein God hath alreadie drawne his sword against vs, and stricken some fewe, and except we cause him by our speedie repentance to sheath it, he (no doubt) hath determined to strike vs at the quicke, how fearefully the wrath of God consumes, if his indignation be once kindled, we all know: but who shalbe able to abide it? let vs there∣fore that haue not yet felt his furie, become wise by the view of others miseries, the burnt child shuns the fire, but we (farre more foolish then children) cast our selues headlong into the flame, notwithstanding we see the ashes of our friendes burnt before vs. To publish for the benefit of al peopl that list to read it, and put it in practise, a treatise contayning a method to preserue vs from the Plague, as also how to order, gouerne, and cure those that are infected therewith: Collected out of the authorities of the most excellents, both former and later writers, and for the greatest part thereof obserued, and tried by mine owne experience: this being the first publicke bud that hath sprung of my labours, and the orphant of my studies, I present vnto your Lordship as a pledge of my zeale and humble dutie towards you, and your honorable and matchlesse vertues, deiued in part from your noble Father, but more plenti∣fully

inriched with your inuincible minde, and peerelesse indeuors, wherein you manifest to the eye of the world, the true Idea of perfect nobilitie, leaue to succeeding posteritie, a memorable remem∣brance of your neuer dying fame, and giue encou∣ragement to all noble mindes, to imitate (though vnable to match your honorable resolutions.) If your Lordship deigne to patronize my indeuors, (farre vnworthie so honorable a Patron) I shall be securely protected from the venemous teeth of all carpers, beare (with ease) the burden of their re∣proches, waieng as light as winde: and with a fa∣uorable aspect from you, (as from the worlds bright eye) disperse all the foggie mistes of their false con∣ceiued thoughts. My labours want not their re∣ward, if they winne your good word, nor my mind his desire, if you vouchsafe to fauour. Thus wishing your Lordship as many happie yeares as vertues, and no fewer vertues then the firmament af∣fords lightes, commending my labors to your honorable protection, I humblie take my leaue, this 25. of March. 1592.
