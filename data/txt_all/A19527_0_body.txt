CAtulus Lactatius hauing done the vtmost of his endeuours to stay his Souldiers that fled be∣fore their enemies, put him selfe among the Run-awayes, and dis∣sembled to be a Coward, to beare them companie; That so they might rather seeme to follow their Captaine, then runne away from the Enemie: This was a neglecting of his reputation, to conceale the shame and reproch of others. I haue (accomplished Archi-Monarch) with the rest of these Boreo-Britan Poets, been ingrately silent; and with the cold asshes of Feare, haue couered the coales of my Loue: Because (as Archileonida sayd to the Thratian Legates, There were many moe more valiant Cittizens in Sparta, then her Sonne Brasidas,) I found my selfe but a doltish Cheril, among so many delicate Homers: And thus, neither durst I prayse thy Fortunes, nor congratulate thy Great∣nes; But now am bold to present to your most sacred eyes these louely litures, both to encourage others, & make sa∣tisfaction
 for my (seeming ingratitude) long silence. I in∣tend not with those Macedonian Parasites to call Alex∣ander, the Sonne of Iupiter: nor with Hermodorus to make Antigonus the sonne of Phoebus. I write not to enlarge thy fame, which is boundles; nor to begge reward, which I merit not; nor to purchase prayse, which I craue not; but in few lines to shew the infinitie of my Loue to your Grace. When Vitellius, at the Battell of Cremona was slaine, the Parthian King Vologesus sent Embassa∣dours to Vespasian, offering him fourtie thousand Par∣thian Horsemen to ayde him, (This was a glorious and ioyfull thing to be sought vnto with offers of so great as∣sistaunce, and yet not to need them): So thankes were giuen to Vologesus, and hee at perpetuall peace from thencefoorth with the Romans. I haue sent (dread Leige) those Papers Congratulatorie, and Paroenetic, to your Maiestie, not that your Highnes needes them, but with Vologesus, to shew my Loue to Vespasian, and purchase his thankes. If you like my labours, they come not too late: if you loath them, they come too soone to light. Thus, bold as a true and louing Subiect, fearefull as a blushing and onmanumitted Prentice in Poesie, I remaine your Maiestes,
