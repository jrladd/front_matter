VVpon a Christmas Euen, som what
night Easter, anon after Whit∣sontide,
walking in a Coach from
London to Lambeth by water, I o∣uertooke
a man that met me in the
morning before sunne set, the wind being in Ca∣pricorne,
the Signe Southwest, with silence I
demanded many questions of him, and hee with
much pensiuenesse did answere me merrily to the
full, with such ample and empty replications, that
both our vnderstandings being equally satisfied,
we contentiously agreed to finish and prosecute the
narration of the vnknowne Knight Sir Gregory
Nonsence, so sitting downe vpon our shoulders,
resting vneasily on a banke of Sicamores vnder a
Tree of odoriferous and contagious Camomile,
after three sighs, smilingly vttered in the He∣brew
Character, two grones from the Chaldean
Dialact, fiue sobs from the Arabian Sinquapace,
sixe dumps from Germane Idiome, nine Moodes

of Melancholly from the Italian tongue, with one
hub hub from the Hiberbian outcry. And last he
laughed in the Cambrian tongue, and beganne to
declare in the Vtopian speech, what I haue heere
with most diligent negligence translated into the
English Language, in which if the Printer hath
placed any line, letter or sillable, whereby this
large volume may bee made guilty to bee vnder∣stood
by any man, I would haue the Reader not to
impute the fault to the Author, for it was farre
from his purpose to write to any purpose, so ending
at the beginning, I say as it is applawsfully writ|
ten and commended to posterity in the Midsom∣mer
nights dreame. If we offend, it is with our
good will, we came with no intent, but to offend,
and shew our simple skill.
