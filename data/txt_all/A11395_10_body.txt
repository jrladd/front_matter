REnowned Scipio, though thine Ennius
Still merit best the best of thy regard:
Though (worthily) his Trumpet be pre-ferr'd
To sound the Triumphs thou hast wonn for vs;
Yet, sith one Penn, how-euer plentious
(Were it the Mantuan or Meonian Bard)
Suffizeth not to giue Fame's full Reward
To thy great Deeds, admir'd and glorious:
Though Hee, thy Homer be; Thou, his Achilles;
Both by each other Happy: Thou (heer-in)
T'haue such a Trump as his immortall Quill-is;
Hee such a Theam as thy High Vertues been:
It shall (Great Worthie) no Dis-Honour be
That (English) Bartas hath Sung (thrice) to thee.
