TO haue a thankfull minde, and not to shew it,
Is to know much, and not let others know it;
I will not flatter for a benefit,
Yet better to acknowledge, then forget.
A farther libertie I doe not aske;
That were to me (alas) too great a taske:
For if th'account bee cast of what is due,
I owe the most of any man to you.
