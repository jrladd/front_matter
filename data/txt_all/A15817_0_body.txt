ESpying by apparant
shewe (worshipfull Syr)
the greate good will you
beare vnto those that abā∣don
idlenes, and applye
themselues to some kinde
of exercise, where, by often frequenting, it
may bring vnto them (hereafter) such praise
and profite, as they shal haue singular occa∣sion
to pray for those friendes, which lende
them ayde in the same. It is not materiall
to amplify, or glose vnto such, whose iudge¦ment
is vniuersall, whose foresight in mat∣ters,
hath great foreshewe of silent interpre∣tation.
I am to craue at your worshippes
handes, three things. First, not to condemne
my boldnesse. Secondly, not to repulse my
rudenesse. And thirdly, to accepte my sim∣ple
good wil, who wrote this with as zea∣lous

affection, as euer Paris bare vnto faire
Helena. This simple peece, which by my
simpl industry I haue pēned, is vtterly voyd
of eloquence: For why, it was neuer (as yet)
my chance to haue any conuersatiō, where
such societie accompanied together. For
Pallas will not be seene to intermeddle her
selfe where Pan so peartly preaceth in place.
I am perchance too tedious vnto your wor∣shippe,
and make a long Oration vnto litle
effecte. But as a shameles crauer hath not
the ciuilitie to make an end: So I the skilles
writer haue not the perseuerance of inough.
I therfore to be short, make this my present
vnto you, intituled, The Castle of Courtesie,
whereunto is adioyned, The Houlde of Hu∣militie,
a matter not so worthie, as you are
worthy to be a Patrone off. But fame hath
so spread your courtesie and humility, your
ciuilitie and humanitie, as it abasheth me
to speake: because I wante the skill accor∣ding.
I beseech your worship not to weigh
the worke but the wil: not the matter but
the maker: vvho vvil during life, rest at your

commandement, vvishing vnto your vvor∣shippe
vvith vnfayned faith, your hearts re∣quest
(in vvhat soeuer,) and eternall felicitie
in the vvorld to come, Amen.
