RIGHT HONORABLE:
I Haue my selfe beene an eye-wit∣nesse of your Loyaltie, and generall loue to our Country, or if you please, the Maiesty of England, and can resolue the strangest humor'st; that neuer man deserued better of the State, then your selfe for many employments: But especially, when I saw you Knighted in the Field (and none but your selfe) yea the durty fields before Kinsole, my heart leaped for ioy to apprehend, that your Vertue

and worth commanded that addition of Honour, without which, let ambitious hastinesse imagine what it list, Princes cannot set their best Fauorites on a more substantiall Seate of glorious eminence: And thus much for the generall. For particulars, I was in those dayes beholding to your Table and Purse, and in a manner the third Officer of your Regiment; as it pleased you to grace and fauour me farre beyond my desert. All which considered, as I haue great reason to bee thankefull vnto you, so could I thinke of no better meanes, then this poore Dedication: First, because I am resolued it will out-last a Marble Toombe, and when Death hath vndertaken to obliterate our memories, yet shall after-ages demand, who this Earle of Clenricard was, and wish from their hearts, that the Noble men of their times would set you before them for a Mirror: Secondly, because it is the remarke∣ablest Story of Ireland, and a businesse so well knowne to your selfe, that I submit to your better iudgement, if I haue fayled in any thing: Third∣ly, because I am taught by experience, that there is no presenting of Bookes to any man, without a primordiall acquaintance, secret supportation, or (as wee call it) Court friendshippe. Last of all, and I hope the best of all, because it may stand

in the steade of Precept, or Caution to detaine such worthy persons within their owne Circles, or di∣uert them from presuming on any power against such a Prince, as the Monarch of Great Britaine, of gouernement, as the Maiesty of England: In which assurance, I leaue you to the Commander of all Thoughts, Words, and Actions, submitting my selfe and the worke, to your fauourable censure, and Honourable acceptation.
