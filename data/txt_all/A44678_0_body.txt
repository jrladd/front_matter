SIR,
I Have perused the Papers which you sent me, and
find, as far as I can recollect, they contain in them
the Substance of what was delivered: With no more
mistakes than is usual, in writing from the mouth of
one who is not of the slowest speakers.
Some things besides, which the limits of the time al∣low'd
not to be spoken (having some short memorials of
them by me) I have added, conceiving they might,
also, contribute towards the good end you proposed to
your self, in so earnestly desiring this publication,
the assisting of their patience, and their good and pla∣cid
thoughts of God, who are exercis'd under Long and
Languishing Distempers. The observations which your
Profession hath occasion'd you to make in the cases
of many others, hath, I doubt not, let you see the need
of somewhat to this purpose; otherwise the example

you have had so long before your eyes of so calm and
compos'd a temper in this excellent relative of yours,
might have made you less apprehensive how great
an addition a fretful, unquiet spirit is, both to the
Sin, and the Affliction of a Sickly State. I am sen∣sible
your own affliction is great in the loss you now
sustain. The relief will be great, and suitable; which
the forethoughts of that State will afford, where
they neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage,
but are as the Angels of God in Heaven. I am,
SIR,
In much sincerity, and affection, yours
to serve you in the work and labour
of the Gospel,
