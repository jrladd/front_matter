MY LORD,
I Am emboldned to hope for your pardon, in offering to the world so mean a Discourse under the Patronage of your Lordships Name; because I am very certain that you will never decline the owning that glorious subject it Treats of, which in opposition to our Adversaries of both sides, is the peculiar and unblemished Glory of our Church, in which your Lordship does justly bear so great a Character.
The news of the horrid Rebellion, broke out in the Western parts of this Kingdom, shrouding it self under the wonted coâˆ£lours that all such Villanies assume, occasioned my offering these following thoughts, in the next ordinary course of my Preaching, to my Country and plain Auditory; of whom it pleases me to tell your Lordship, that I hope and beleive they have heartily received the Doctrines of Loyalty to their Prince, and Duty to the Church, as a part of their Religion.

And concerning this mean Publication, I will confess, My Lord, that I was not unwilling, by it, to let our Enemies know, that even the most inconsiderable of the Clergy of our Church, will yet do their utmost to assert the glorious Doctrines of it, whenever bold and malicious men shall attempt the dishonoring of any of them.
And I hope 'tis not amiss for your Lordship to receive some Testimonies to prove, That those of us, that judge ourselves the meanest of our Reverend Brethren, among whom we are, will yet never, By Divine Assistance, desert the great and hitherto victorious Champions of our Church and Cause: But that by our Practising and Preaching the Doctrines of sound and undefiled Religion toward God, and of entire and unfeigned Loyalty to our Prince; we shall endeavour to Continue to After Ages, the Memory and Records of what Principles our Church has taught us, and what we have taught our People.
May it please your Lordship, To forgive this whole Address, and to accept the dutiful Tender of my Vowed Prayers.
My Lord,  Dedham, July 8. 1685.
