TO thee braue knight, who from the Delphian God e
I onate these famous Acts of Odcomb:
To thee alone, and vnto none but thee,
For Patronage my toyling Muse doth flee.
I gaue my drowning Coriat vnto Archy,
And with his ure escape to thee now march 1,
Not doubting but thou wilt in kindnesse take
These lines thus writ, for his, and thy, deere sake.
If thou in kindnesse wilt accept this taske,
Hereafter I will better things vn-caske,
And make the world thy worth to glory at
In greater measure then at Coriat.
Il'e mount thee vp in urse past Charles his Waine,
Il'e make the Mocue Endimion to disdaine,
Il'e write in euer-deering lines thy fame.
As farre as Phoebus spreades his glorious flame.
Il'e make thee pluckestorne Saturne by the Chaps,
And braue great Ioue amids his thunder-clappes.
Il'e cause thy praises t'eclipt the God as Armes,
Il'e wake Donia Venus yeeld to loues alarmes.
The nimble Mercury shall be thy oot-mad,
Is thou wilt grace my lines: therefore lo itoo't man.
But if to patronize into thou dost scorne,
'Twere better then thou neuer hadst been borne:
For 'gainst disdaine my Muses oneli pts.
To write with Gall, comt with Aqua-lottis:
And Vinegar, and Salt, and Sublimation.
Which where it falles will'crtch & sall: probatum.
Then at thou lou'st the Fairy Queene thine Aunt,
Daine to touchsafe this poore and triuiall graunt:
Then I thy Poet will with how Subiection,
Proceed to write Tom Coriats Resurrection.
Yours euer wh shall perseuer in your ,
