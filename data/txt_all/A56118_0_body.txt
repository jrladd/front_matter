Madam,
I Hope your Ladyship has all the Sa∣tisfaction which the Country can give to any one, or your own Expecta∣tion promised to your self, and whereas Expectation is often raised above En∣joyment, I hope Enjoyment now rises high, and surmounts all your gay No∣tions of it▪ I know, and methinks at this very Instant I have a sense and a share of that Joy which your Ladyship is affected with upon your Retreat from the Town: Let that Joy encrease, and in the Country, and in every Place, and in every thing let it still be grea∣ter
and so much rather, because it  greater than you deserve,  same Virtue and Prudence, which make you deserve it, will be sure to make your Jy, and all Things very Innocent. I have sometimes ex∣ercised your Ladyships Condescension; and with that easie Mildness, which you shew n all Occasions, and with which you have already learned to bear all Evils, you have seemed to bear the Trouble of Reading my Instructions: But you never had so much Advantage from my Writing, as now, to satisfie for the Trouble, nor I so good Occasion to give it. I doubt not but you will have the same Thought of the Occasion, I have my self; and so I may hope for an Effect equal to it. I have often beheld your growing Piety with a secret and rising Satisfaction, and I cannot but endeavour to continue and improve my own Satisfaction, by Exhorting, Advising, Intreating your Ladyship to continue and improve your Piety. Seeing I have so great a pleasure in
the View, I am become a Party, and my own Interest, that I may have it still, engages me to do all I can for the enlargement of a thing which gives it: A thing which is so good in it self, and so advantageous to you, and which you seem to Repay and Reward for all its Advantage by the graceful Light and Beauty you reflect upon it; when like a well-set Diamond, it appears in you and borrows from you. I have with so much Pleasure observed that Piety, which was your own original Growth; and then with how much more shall I observe, and with how Innocent a Pride, any part of your piety hereaf∣ter, which has been planted in your Mind by my Endeavour, and which being placed in so Rich, and Noble Ground, must there be to a Wonder fruitful by your own. I shall see it with a Joy refined and high, with a greater than that of the King in History, when he saw the fair and goodly Tree, his own Hand had set, and then his De∣light in Surveying the Growth of the
Tree scarce was equal to this of re∣membring that he had set it. I should think my self to do Service to the World, in doing this to your Ladyship, who may be so useful to the World; and to Religion, by the Influence of your Example; by the Authority of your Interest, and by the Prudence of your Zeal to make use of both, as of every thing, to the best and most worthy Purposes. So shall I have, in this my Writing, that glorious Hope of doing the greatest Good by the shortest way, to many in one; as when the chief City is taken, all the Neighbouring Country very often comes in by an easie Surren∣der, or is Conquered with it: And surely the thing will as much become your Quality as it will be promoted by your Zeal, that there should be a nu∣merous Train to attend you in your Course of Virtue, and in your Journey towards Heaven. All the Religious Things, when carried on by you to o∣thers, will at the same time be im∣proved, and become more inviting by
their passing through your Hands, as Liquors take a fragrant, and more grateful tast from the Vessel through which they pass. When there have been already such shining Effects of your Virtue, and when the Cause is so fruitful and sure, so generous and al∣ways ready to produce them, I may oblige my self and the World by all my pleasing and most agreeable Presages, and yet my Gift of Foretelling may not be, like those Effects, extraordinary; as they who pretend to the Faculty of declaring things to come, do little more than argue from the same Causes to the same Effects. The Country gives you lei∣sure, and you want nothing for the rai∣sing a Good-will, to read such things as this before you; and the Country gives not only leisure, but a new Ar∣gument for Religion, because there the invisible things of God are un∣derstood by the things which are made, By every Flower you gather, and every Fruit you eat, by the mean∣est Herb you tread on, and the least
thing you see in the Garden, or in the Field. The Country has already no little part in your Favour, it has so large a Place in your Affections, that it could lend some even to things less Grateful; the most disagreeable things would cease to be so, when this should recommend them to you: But surely the Country will have new Endear∣ments, and more lively Charms, when you shall begin to apprehend it, as ha∣ving all the convenience, not only to breath, but to think more freely too, and as having at the Leisure, and Li∣berty, and Enlargment, not only for many other Purposes, but for one thing which you love more than the Coun∣try, and then all things, for Religion. Thus I have frankly declared the De∣sign of these Papers, and your Lady∣ship will generously pardon the length of them, and all their Faults; whereof I think my self to be guilty with Au∣thority; because the Design is such as gives the highest Authority to this, and to any other Action, and to all the
harmless Errors of it. When I have freely confest the Purpose of my Wri∣ting, (and this no worse than what you hear) your Ladyship will give me leave to speak freely upon it, with all that plainness which good Designs always covet, and well-meant Instructions chuse, and the true Ends of both re∣quire. Then may I be allowed to speak without the Ceremony of Address to your Sex, and your Quality; that I may thus teach you to forget your Greatness, which you seem already to know so little of, and to be your self almost a stranger to: The nice Con∣sideration of it is to be laid aside for the Time by me in Writing, and by you in Reading. This Boon I ask at the opening of my Discourse, as the Great Council asks (at the first opening of it,) Freedom of Access and of Speech in Debates upon Things of pub∣lick Good. As to the Grandeur of Birth, you have so much of the Nobi∣lity which Virtue gives, that the other is almost sunk in this, and the greater
Light scarce allows the less to be seen. As to the gaudy Honours of the solemn Regard which such a Birth does al∣ways claim, your Ladyship is to leave this part to others; as that is not, like Virtue, your own, so the esteem which it should have is not to be from your self; and yet to that an Esteem is due: Indeed Moses would never have refused to be called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter, and the Grand∣son of a King, if he had been the thing which he was called, he would not have Renounced the innocent Glories of such a Relation, as he did not despise the in∣glorious Reproach of Christ, if the Pretence would not have been false Heraldry, and the Advantage only the enjoying the Pleasures of Sin for a Season. But so great, Madam, is your share, and so rich you are, in high∣er Things, that you may reserve e∣nough for your self, if you resign your Claim of Birth to them who have no∣thing besides it, to them who are con∣tented to be still what they were born,
and, as if they were only over-grown infants of one Days Age, have made no Progress since the first Minutes of Life. I now beg leave to tell stran∣gers, that they are not to take the length of your Understanding from that of your Age, and to tell your self, that I have so great an Opinion of your Understanding, and so little of my own, as to think I could not easily Write any thing upon such a Subject above your reach: So great is my O∣pinion too of your Piety, as to think I could not easily prescribe any thing a∣bove your Practice. I am sure, nothing which can have any part in your Religi∣ous well-being, though never so high, can be above my Wishes, and it is no more beyond my Attempts to enforce it, than beyond yours to do it. I am sure again, if you are to have every thing I wish, you cannot have too much of that Wisdom, which (according to the Wise, though Apocryphal Wri∣ters) reaches from one end to ano∣ther
mightily, and sweetly orders all things.
My willing Consent is always ready for all your Inclinations, and my joy∣ning with you as ready for all your Service. But I would, of all things, carry on the pleasing Harmony of your good Actions in Consort with you; in nothing so much you desire, in nothing so much you shall have the Concurrence and united Force of,
Madam,
