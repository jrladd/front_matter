May it please your Grace,
HAving endeavoured, with some success, to restore the Weekly Commu∣nions,in that Church to which I relate, and hoping for greater, by publishing these Discourses, which I made there upon that occa∣sion; I take the boldness to send them abroad, under your
Grace's Protection: that if they can do any good, all that shall receive it may un∣derstand unto whom, under God, they principally owe it, and stand obliged to acknow∣ledge it.
For it was by your Grace's Fatherly Care, that I was put in mind of this great Duty, and exhorted to put it in practice: which pro∣duced these Meditations,wherein I have pressed it up∣on others. Who will be stir∣red up, I trust, by this means, to bless God for setting over them such a Faithful Pastor, as, by taking care to have this Sacred Food provided continually for them, seeks their increase in true Religion, and their nourishment with all goodness.
They are very blind who do not see this to be a sin∣gular blessing; and very hard, whose hearts are not affected therewith: especially at such a time as this, when Religi∣on calls for all the supports we are able to lend it; and teaches us, it desires no bet∣ter,
no other than it self, if we will but uphold it in our hearts.
Of which I beseech the Lord of all power and might, the giver of all good things, to make every one of us so deeply sensible; that we may be no longer negligent in the prin∣cipal office of it: but, in some measure, return unto that First love towards our blessed Lord and Saviour; from which we, as well as other Christian People, have long since shamefully faln.
And may the same Good God, who put this thing in∣to your
Grace's heart, be pleased to bless and prosperall your pious designments: and prolong your dayes, which are spent in the study of the publick good, to see the ancient Devotion, and Ver∣tue too, not only bud again in this Church, but flourish also, and bring forth fruit in such abundance; that it may be the joy of all its Friends, the terror of all its Enemies; and, as the Prophet speaks of Jerusalem, a Praise in the Earth.
Then will this that your Grace hath done, be spoken of with Praise; and Poste∣rity will call you Blessed. Nay, to have but designedand attempted this, what∣soever the issue be, is so praise-worthy; that it will make your Name no less ho∣noured in future Generations, than that great Devotion, which we see combines in you with eminent Learning, that deep Humility, which cohabits with the highest Dignity, makes your Self to be reverenced in this.
With which Reverence, if the Confidence I take, in making this small Present to your Grace, seem inconsistent, I comfort my self with the long experience I have had; that the best men are not al∣ways
the hardest to please, but ever the easiest to for∣give: As I doubt not your Grace will the presumption of this Address, from,
7th Sunday af∣ter
Trinity, 1684.
May it please your Grace,
