IT is cōmonly seen (right honorable) that all men occupy them selues most in the reading of those matters, wherein they haue delight, eyther for that they are naturally disposed therevn∣to, or else well experienced in the same. The which consideration be∣ing ioyned with the Argument of this my booke, I coulde not deuise with my selfe a more fitte patron, to whome I might dedicate the same, than to your honour. For such no∣ble
 courage hath nature wrought in you, found out by effecte in martiall affaires, as I persuade my selfe you will delight and recreate your selfe muche, with the reading of the vali∣ant acts, done by diuers courageous persons, in these last ciuill warres of Fraunce. Accept therefore (ryght honourable) my choyce, and par∣don my boldnesse, which good will hath caused me to shewe, presuming vpon your honourable curtesie, by whiche I am drawne, as by the load∣stone, to offer this simple present to your honours handes: I wishe the same might in any part be answera∣ble to your worthynesse. VVhere∣fore not to staye your honour with longer speach, I take my leaue, recō∣mending my poore paines to your honours protection.
