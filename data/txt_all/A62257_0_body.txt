May it please your Lordship,
IN Obedience to your Lordships commands, I first Preacht, and now Publish this ensuing Discourse. Whether I have offer'd any thing herein that may probably win any to a love of and veneration for this great Office, I shall not presume to judge, none being more conscious of its defects than my self. But since it hath past your Lordships approbation, and was favourably receiv'd by the Reverend my Brethren of the Clergy, I do the less value the censures of others.
I am not ignorant that this Age, in the Ʋniversities and Cities especially, abounds with great Scholars and eminent Preachers, the glory of our Church, as well as the envy of our Adversaries; and I hope those great men will not disdain to have a Mite thrown in now and then (though by the meanest Rural Divine) to make some little addition to their Treasury.
When your Lordship first limited me to this subject, I thought it a barren soyl, because not commonly manag'd, but after a few thoughts spent upon i, and turning up some of the surface, I promised my self it would prove (to speak like a Countrey-Parson) of the same nature with new broken up ground, which usually yields a double Crop. I
found the matter so copious, and the Office, which St. Paul reckons amongst his six Fundamentals, so easily defenda∣ble, that it has run this Discourse into a more than usual length; for which I hope the great usefulness of the Sub∣ject, though not the way of handling it, will apologize, if not make sufficient amends.
That your Lordship hath highly advanced the honour and interest of this Church in general, and particularly retriev'd the almost lost Reputation of this Sacred Office, stopping for ever the mouths of our Adversaries (who are apt to bellow against unpreaching Bishops, and the neglect of those Offices that bring no secular advantage) by your frequent Preachings, publick Exhortations, and constant Ministration of this holy Office; That by your candour and condescension, you oblige your Clergy to a regular Conformity, and a love to your Lordships injunctions as well as person; That by force of Argument, manag'd with a winning mildness and sweetness of disposition, you have worn off the natural ruggedness of many of the Dissen∣ters, and prevail'd upon them to promise a submission: These things are not unknown to us who have the happi∣ness to live within your Jurisdiction, nor will it be deem'd a piece of Sycophantry by any who have the least knowledge of your Lordships Person or Actions.
And amongst the many demonstrations of your Lord∣ships known candour, these are not the least, That you com∣mand me to Print this ensuing Discourse, thereby shewing your readiness to encourage the industry of the meanest; That you please to undertake the protection of it from the proud and censorious; And that you give me leave in so publick a manner to subscribe my self
