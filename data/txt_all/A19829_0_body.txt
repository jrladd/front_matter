TO THE MOST EXCELLENT MA∣IESTIE OF THE HIGHEST∣borne-Princesse, ANNE of Denmark, Queene of England, Scotland, France and Ireland

HEre, what your sacred influence begat
(Most lou'd, and most respect∣ed Maiestie)
With humble heart, and hand, I consecrate
Vnto the glory of your memo∣rie:
As being a piece of that solemnitie,
Which your Magnificence did celebrate
In hallowing of those roofes (you rear'd of late)
With fires and chearefull hospitalitie
Whereby, and by your splendent Worthines
Your name shal longer liue then shal your walles,
For, that faire structure goodnesse finishes,
Beares off all change of times, and neuer falles.
And that is it hath let you in so farre
Into the heart of England as you are.
And worthily, for, neuer yet was Queene
That more a peoples loue hath merited
By all good graces, and by hauing been
The meanes our State stands fast established
And blest by your blest wombe, who are this day
The highest borne Queene of Europe, and alone
Haue brought this land more blessings euery way,
Then all the daughters of strange Kings haue done.
For, we by you no claimes, no quarrels haue,
No factions, no betraying of affaires:
You doe not spend our blood, nor states, but saue:
You strength vs by alliance, and your haires.
Not like those fatall marriages of France,
For whom this kingdome hath so dearely paid,
Which onely our afflictions did aduance:
And brought vs farre more miseries, then aid.
Renowned Denmark, that hast furnished
The world with Princes, how much doe we owe
To thee for this great good thou dist bestow,
Whereby we are both blest, and honoured?
Thou didst not so much hurt vs heretofore
But now thou hast rewarded vs farre more.
But what doe I on this high subiect fall
Here, in the front of this low Pastorall?
This a more graue, and spacious roome requires
To shew your glorie, and my deepe desires.

Your Maiesties most humble seruant
