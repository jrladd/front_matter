RIGHT HONOURABLE,
THough I may easily apprehend that some will not be wanting, who will look upon these Lines with an evil Eye, and argue from worse Principles than those of Logick, that I am proud and presumptuous in making use of Your Name in this sort; yet upon mature de∣liberation, I have adventured so to do, resolving rather to run the hazard of their hardest cen∣sures, than to neglect so fit an opportunity of te∣stifying to the World my Humble Respects to Your Honour, and my grateful thoughts of Your manifold favours towards Me and Mine.
To see some Men live, as if Hell and its

Everlasting Sorrows were but Scarecrows, and Melancholy Fancies, and (then) to see others hardening them in their Infidel impieties, by making them believe that it is so indeed; (And that they have gotten the knowledge of this De∣vilish Doctrine, by praying to the God of Hea∣ven, as my Author pretends very smoothly in his Preface) This (my Lord) is sufficient to provoke a patient and peaceable spirit; The displeasure of my Heart against his Execrable Book, hath now engaged my Pen against it; And (with the Poetical liberty) I may truly say—Si natura negat, facit indignatio Li∣brum.
Certainly, it is great pity that a Book of this kind I deal with, should pass one Year to an end, without a full and formal Confutation; And I was almost ready to Write a Satyr against my many Betters, (that have a great deal more Learning, and a little more leisure than my self) for suffering it to go so long without Controul.

Well, I have now (through Providence) finished that Work which they should have done long before: For a Pamphlet of this nature must needs be as worthy of a severe Reproof, as those Pieces that have been licensed by his Ho∣liness at Rome, which they have so often, and so excellently opposed; For 'tis worse to believe Hell a Dream, than to believe Purgatory to be a Real thing.
And now (Right Honourable) besides my Obligations to You, it may seem in other respects very proper to present You with a Dis∣course of this sort; because the Reality of Hell thus Proved, Defended and Applied, may by God's help make You still more and more care∣ful of that great Work, which I perswade my self Your Honour is truly careful of already, viz. To lead Others in the way to Heaven, by Your good Example.

The Lord Jesus multiply his choicest bles∣sings upon Your Self, Your Virtuous Lady, and the rest of Your Family, granting You height of Honour, and length of Days, the real com∣forts of his Holy Ordinances, and the Eternal Felicities of his Father's House. So praying, resteth
