Much, and most deservedly, Honoured,
HOW stale and suspected soever the Pretence be, of extorting Impor∣tunity to inforce it, as an Ex∣cuse of appearing in Print; yet no Man of Sense, nay, Prejudice it self, than which nothing is more senseless, can judge me so far lost, to all Sentiments of Truth, Mo∣desty, and common Prudence, as to appeal
to such unexceptionable Witnesses in a Case that would not bear it.
The Truth is, I was with so much Re∣luctancy brought to let this Sermon see more Light, which unavoidable late going to Church, forc'd me to deliver in the Dark, that I rather need to beg Pardon for it.
But when I had, almost to Rudeness, withstood Requests, a Person of Quality tur∣ned intreating into arguing, and inforc'd some Passages in the Sermon, with which he judged my Denials not well to consist; then, as the Eagle, pierced with an Arrow feathered from its own Wing, my obstina∣cy was vanquished by my own Weapons; and with unwilling Willingness, I yielded to run the Risk of its losing by the Eye, what it had beyond expectation gain'd by the Ear.
I heartily bless God, that I have liv'd to see Judges in England, who cannot only bear, but approve such honest plain preaching, and
desire it may be made publick, with hope that it will do some Service to the Nation.
And if I may touch so small a thing, (for I cannot own it needs Apology,) my citing so many Scriptures, I suspect, will be styled Nimiam Diligentiam, and but a solemn trifling: Be it so; yet I did not run into this right-hand Error blindfold. Had my business been only with Men's Ears and Fan∣cies, I should have used other Tools: But having to do with their Hearts and Conscien∣ces, and to cut down Sin, and build up Righ∣teousness, I knew nothing so fit for my Pur∣pose, as the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, which is quick and powerful, and the only Weapon fit to pull down the strong Holds of Sin and Satan. God will be God, whether Sinners will or no; and his Word will retain an Awe upon Men's Minds, how unmodish soever it seem to urge so much of it; and will be a golden Sceptre to convince and rule, or else a Rod of Iron to condemn and to break in pieces.

And here I present it to your Honours, and the unprejudiced honest Readers, and if it may prove useful to the Publick, and ac∣ceptable to Men of such a Character, it shall suffice; (for a Plea for Righteousness can∣not be over-welcome to unrighteous Men till it convince them to forsake it;) and though it should fall more short of Acceptance from the Press, than it exceeded my Hopes from the Pulpit, I shall rest satisfy'd in this Act of Obedience to my Betters, and Kindness to my Equals; and shall study to approve my self more readily
