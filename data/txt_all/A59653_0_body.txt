MY LORD,
THAT good Man, whose Me∣mory these Papers endeavour to preserve, was so well known, and so much in your Lordship's Favour, that were not the Character they give him, so disproportionate to his Merit, I should not doubt of a candid accep∣tance of them.
Perhaps it was one Instance of his Modesty, in his valnation of him∣self, that he would design me to this Service, who, he knew would rather under-rate than flatter him.

I humbly present what I have done, to you Lordship's Patronage; who finding leisure (amidst those Public Cares, whereby you serve their Majesties, and oblige our Church and Nation) to consult the future flourishing Condition of that long fa∣mous School, by taking care for a fit Successor, that may deliver Posterity from suffering loss by the death of Mr. Glascock; will also vouchsafe to be a Patron as of the Concerns of the succeeding, so of the Concerns of the succeeding, so also of the Name and Memory of the dead School∣master. And for his sake will par∣don this presumptious Address of his Friend.
May it please your Lordship,
Colchester, April 4. 1690.
