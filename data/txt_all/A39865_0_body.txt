My Lord,
THe Esteem I have for your Nation in general, and the great Veneration I am obliged to have for some par∣ticular Persons of Quality of it, has made me ambitious of being known to all those of Wit and

fine Parts. Amongst that Num∣ber, none has a greater Character than your Lordship, whose early Knowledge of all that is excellent in Learning, and of all the Graces of the Mind, promised the World that accomplished Great Man, it now with so much Pride and Satis∣faction beholds; and which, even without the addition of your illu∣strious Birth, were sufficient, to gain you the Esteem of all Man∣kind; and you are never mention∣ed, but with such vast Accumula∣tions of Praise, as are given only to uncommon Men, and such, as something extraordinary alone can merit.
To all your advantages of Na∣ture, elevated Birth, Virtue, Knowledge, Wit, Youth, and Honours, to compleat your Hap∣piness,

Fortune has added her part too; and has ally'd your Lordship by Marriage to the Great and No∣ble Family of Burlington, which has at once been honour'd with more Earls than any great Family cou'd ever boast, and whose Ver∣tues, and Loyalty, deserve parti∣cular and lasting Trophies to ce∣lebrate them to Posterity.
My Lord, I presume to dedi∣cate this little Book to your Lord∣ship, which I ventured to trans∣late, because it pleased me in the French; and tho but a trifle, has something in it out of the way of ordinary Wit, which renders it more worthy to be laid at your Lordships Feet. If it is not done with that exactness it merits, I hope your Lordship will pardon it in a Woman, who is not supposed

to be well versed in the Terms of Philosophy, being but a new be∣ginner in that Science; but where I have failed, your Lordship's Judgment can supply; and if it finds acceptance with your Lord∣ship, I am already so much a Phi∣losopher, as to despise what the World says of it, and will pride my self only in being,
My Lord,
