AMongst these VVorthies of my worthlesse paines,
I craue thy VVorth would Patronize my Quill:
VVhich granted, then, O there's my greatest gaines,
If that your Honour doth affect good-will.
And whiles I striue, to praise thy condigne parts,
Thy selfe, the same, more to the VVorlde impartes.


Though noblie borne, thy vertue addes thy fame,
And greater credite is't, when man by merit,
Attaines the title of True Honoures Name,
Than when voide cyphers, doe the same inherit,
For Fortune frownes, when Clownes beginne to craue,
And Honour scornes to stoupe vnto a slaue.


Euen as the shade, the substance cannot flee,
And Honour from true Vertue not degrade:
Though thou fleest Fame, yet Fame shall follow thee:
For Power is lesse than VVorth, VVorth Power made.
And I, I wish, GOD may thy Race preserue,
So long as Sunne and Moone their Course conserue.
