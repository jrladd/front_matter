My very gracious and good Mistres, the loue and duty I bare to your Father whilst hee liued, now after his decease is to you hereditary: to whom by the blessing of your birth he left his vertues. Who bequeathed you those which were hit, gaue you what so euer good is mine, as deuoted to his, he being gone, whom I honored so much whilst he liued: which you may iustly cha∣lenge by al lawes of thankfulnes. My selfe hauing been a wit∣nes of your excellent education, and milde disposition (as I may say) euer from your Cradle, dedicate this Epistle of this vertuous and goodly Lady to your selfe: so like her in all perfection, both of wisedom and learning: which I pray you accept till time shall enable me to leaue you some greater mo∣nument of my loue.
