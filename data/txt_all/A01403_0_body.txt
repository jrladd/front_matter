GEnerous Youth,
without other ceremony or complement, I am now to aduēture a iour∣ney (and a fearefull one) as the first voi∣age that euer I made into the streights of opinion, or seuere Censure: so that polli∣tick and temporising-men would contract a sure bargaine with some rich marchant, honorable patron, or sufficient Statist to protect and counte∣nance the enterprise: But in despight of aduerse Fortune, or calumniation, I haue made choyce of your loue, fauor, vertue, and good condition, of which I take the aduantage in your virgin chastitie, and soules puritie, and wherein I will as much reioyce, as if larger embraces had opened themselues to make me credulous of sincere welcome: Bee therefore your selfe, (expectable Gentl:) and doe but loue mee for olde loues sake; and I shall bee so proud, yea, presumptuous in your accepta∣tion, that neyther windes nor seas shall affright mee, vntill I haue made a satisfactory voyage; or (beeing ouer-freighted with heauy Fortune) sincke the whole Stocke or Remaine of mine abilities in this kinde, in other like aduentures: which if it should so fall out, I could but conclude,
Hic finis Priami.
