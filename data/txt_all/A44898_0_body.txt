Most worthy Sirs,
KNowing that the Dyals that were set up in His Majesties Privy Garden in the Year 1669. by that most ingenious Mathematician Father Francis Hall, alias Line, of the Society of Jesus, and Professor of the Mathematicks at Liege in Germany, were a great Curiosity, and that which hath not been performed publickly in the World; and by reason that they have been some years demolished, and that the Fancy of them may give great satisfaction to those that are any ways inclinable to that Noble Art of Shadows, I have presumed to publish the Explanation of them as it was published by the said Father Line at Liege in Germany; and have no ways deviated from his own Explanation; but the manner of making of each Par∣ticular I have shewed in the foregoing Sheets, and in those places I have referred to the Cuts in this following Appendix: If my Endeavour be accepted by the young Students of this Age, I shall reap the Glory I do ex∣pect, and shall remain their Servant to present them
with something that the Learned of some Ages thought (for those whom I honour, and shall ever) not worthy of; in the mean time I shall rest my self contented to be thought ill of by those whose Honesty is less than their Wit, and whose Covetousness more than both; and shall subscribe my self a Lover of all Lovers of Art, so long as my Name shall be called.
