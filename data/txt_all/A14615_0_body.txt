MY Lord, though vnknowne vnto your Lordshippe, but by a relation made vnto your Honour of my tra∣uels and obseruations beyond the seas, your Lordshippe vouchsafed to grant mee your Letters of fauour to the Vniuersity of Oxford for the furthering of mee in the printing a booke entituled, The Eng∣lish Spanish Pilgrime: and now hauing ac∣complisht the same, I should thinke my selfe most happy, if it would please your Lordship to pro∣tect and fauour these rude lines, not looking vp∣on the meane vnderstanding of the Authour, but the good will and affection wherewith I haue written them; to wit, for the honour of God, and good of my Countrey: wherein I doe especially dis∣couer diuerse subtilties and policies, of the Eng∣lish

Iesuites, Fryers, Monkes and other Semi∣nary Priests beyond the seas, as likewise our English fugitiues vnder the King of Spaines Dominions, and the wrong I receiued in tur∣ning to mine owne true Religion. I doe therefore most humbly beseech your Honor that you would be pleased to take this booke vnder your protecti∣on for the furthering of my 'cause, and repres∣sing of my aduersaries, and I shall euer pray for the much increase of your Lordships health and Honour. The booke I dare not say deserues your fauour, it being a greater token of Nobility in you to Patronize with your greatnesse that which is meane in it selfe, then onely to bee fauo∣rable, where merit may challenge liberality; yet in it selfe the worke is religiously disposed to the discouering of truth, and that all which are any whit inclined to the Sea of Rome, may see the vaile vnmaskt wherwith they were hoodwinkt. I detaine your Honour no longer, but with a lit∣tle digression from you to that God, whom I humbly implore to preserue your Lordship the yeeres of my desire, which is as vnlimited as your Nobility.
