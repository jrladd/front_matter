Madam,
TIs an unquestion'd Priviledge we Authors
have of troubling whomsoever we please with
an Epistle Dedicatory, as we call it, when we
print a Play; Kings and Princes have never
been able to exempt either themselves or their Favourites
from our Persecution. I think your Grace (for a Person of
so great Eminence, Beauty, Indulgence to Wit, and other Ad∣vantages
that mark you out to suffer under Addresses of this
Nature) has scap't very well hitherto. For I do not remem∣ber
your Name yet made a Sanctuary to any of these Crimi∣nals:
But, Madam, your time is come, and you must bear
it patiently. All the favour I can shew you, is that of a good
Executioner, which is not to prolong your pain. You see,
Madam, here the unhappiness of being born in our time, in
which to that Vertue and Perfection▪ the Greeks and Ro∣mans
would have given Temples , the highest

thing we dare dedicate, is a Play or ame such Tries. 
that I now offer to your Grace, you were so kind to when it
was in loose Sheets, that by degrees you have train'd it up to
the confidence of appearing in Print before you: And I hope
you will find it no hard matter to pardon a Presumption you
have your self been accessory to, especially in one that is in∣tirely,
MADAM,
