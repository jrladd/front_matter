GEntlemen, or others, who im∣ploy your time in the studies of such Arts, as are the Orna∣ments of Gentility, to your courtesies I commēd the vn∣learned discourse of my little wit, which as I will not intreate you to com∣mend, deseruing the contrarie: so I hope you will not disdaine, though it deserue discom∣mendation, but so by your pardons, excuse my small discretiō by great desire, that here∣ with lesse haste, I may take as great care as paines, to publish a peece of worke, some∣what more worth the perusing. Till when, wishing you all the fauor of God, with good fortune of the world, I rest in honor of lear∣ning to you and all Students.
