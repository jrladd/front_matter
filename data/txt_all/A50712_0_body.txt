May it please Your Sacred Majesty,
THis Book, having for its subject Precedency, should have, for its Patron, that KING from whom our Precedency flows, as Rays do from the Sun: And beside the nobleness of the Que∣stions here discuss'd, wherein Crowned-heads are oft-times the Clients, and Honour the Prize; These Discourses have the great Charms of newness and variety, which do singly so delight this Age, without any other advantage. I know, Sir, that Dedications have degenerated into Panegyricks; but why should I say any thing of You, of whom the most of Your Subjects be∣lieve better things, than the most eloquent of Your Advo∣cats can express? It being amongst the other wonders of Your life, that You are the best lov'd, though not the best obey'd King in Christendom; the one being the effect

of our Conviction, and the other of Your admired Cle∣mency. And yet I might be allowed to say as much of Your Majesties merit, as some others of Your Subjects; having in those many occasions I had of attending You upon our publick Concerns, been oftentimes both pleas'd and asham'd to find You understand my Trade (that great Art of Reasoning) far better than my self; discovering to me the weakness of some of my Reasons, and improving others. But what I admir'd more was, (for I admire Iustice more than Wit) to find Your Majesty alwayes more concern'd for Your Peoples Security, than for Your own Prerogative: So that if any Kingdom be happier than we, it is because they understand better their own Interest and not because they have a better King. Leav∣ing then, Sir, this beaten path, I hope all wise and just men may expect, that none who owe You and Your Pre∣decessors the Interest they have in Your Kingdoms and Parliaments, because of the Titles You have bestowed upon them, will be so ungrate and imprudent as to oppose You, to please a Re-publican Party, who would turn them out of all that Interest they have now in the Go∣vernment, and punish them most remarkably, by levelling them with the Populace which some adore. There is not a Nobleman in these Nations, who has not been raised

by the Royal Bounty; all Preferments of the Army or long Robe, being the reflex of Your Favour upon their merit, and without which, their greatest Parts had been at best, but excellent Colours lodg'd in the dark: And therefore, when they get Precedency, Preferments, Matches, or Respect, for being Noblemen, they ought to consider to whom they owe all this, and to remember how little they signified when a Common-wealth prevail∣ed: And if any of their Creatures us'd them, as some have done the Monarchy, we should hear that Eloquence, which is now us'd to decry the Government and Your Ministers, employed in railing against the ingratitude of those their Creatures. Nor is it to be feared, that the Nobility and Gentry, who value themselves so much upon the just descent of their Blood, will bear patiently that the Royal Line should be cut, or the Succession diverted from its just and royal Channel; since Your descent, Great Sir, has the advantage over not only all Subjects, but likewise over all Monarchs, that we know, when their Predecessors rose from among the Vulgar; whereas, the first thing History discovers of Yours, is, that they were Kings: God having wrapt up Your Origin in this wonderful mysteriousness, as it were, to teach Your Subjects, that You hold Your Imperial

Crown of Him, alone and immediatly; and in shew∣ing them how to reverence You, has oblieged You to depend upon His Divine Majesty, the only and immediat Author, as well as Support, of Your Power and Great∣ness; and who has heap'd upon You so great, and so re∣markable mercies, as may in letting Your enemies see his just indignation against them, let you also see, what sincere and exemplary Piety He, as Your kind and om∣nipotent Master, expects from You. I know, Sir, that You will allow me to own, that I hate Slavery, and love Property, as well as any of our high pretenders: But, I think our Freedom and Property securer under Your Majesty, whose Right cannot be shaken, without the ruine of ours; it being Your great interest to maintain that Law, which makes so many thousands obey You, in spight of their ambition and avarice. And I still see, that the true Proprietar is the kindest Master; whereas, on the other hand, it is certain, that they who oppose most the Government, are those who did themselves cruelly oppress us under the late Vsurpers, or their impenitent Children; Those, who being picqu'd at want, or loss of Preferment, are acted by revenge and malice; or these who are so easily fool'd, as to believe those who are such, and who inveigh against Your just Power, that they themselves may thereby

become arbitrary; many of whom are themselves greater grievances than any they exclaim against, and greater judge∣ments than any they threaten. So that all we can expect is, to empty our Veins and Purses, for the liberty of being sold or trampled upon, as formerly, by such as have neither so great interest in us, nor affection for us; whilst You, Sir, generously pity what You may chastise, and suffer our extravagancies to grow up to be their own punishment. None of us can say, that we, or our predecessors have for six hundred years, felt the tyrannie of any of our Kings: nor can any of us deny, that all our Miseries and Civil Wars have sprung from the ambition and factiousness of Subjects, who design'd indeed to govern them and us; which should in reason make us rather jealous of our own factiousness, than of our Monarchie. And therefore, Sir, That God may alwayes teach Your Subjects to be just to Your Merit, and to remember the last Age; and may make Your Ministers careful to maintain, but not to stretch Your Prerogative, shall be the constant and ardent Prayer of,
May it please Your Sacred Majesty,
