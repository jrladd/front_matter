Right Worshipful, &c.
THIS Discourse which was at first hastily
Compos'd, whilst I was a Candidate for
your Favours, is now, with great relu∣ctancy,
drawn into publick view. I am uneasie to
think, how slender and imperfect a Piece is now put
into the hands of Those Men, who were always
justly esteemed as a most Accomplish'd and Ex∣celling
Part of the English Nation. But this being
the first Command with which You were pleased to
honour me, I was willing to give You any, even this
imprudent Earnest of my future Observance. If Your
Choice of this occasional and peculiar Subject, cannot
exempt my Performance from the Censures of other

Men; it will be my only Refuge to appeal to Your
Protection. That I am now happily Entitled to it, I
can ascribe to nothing but the known Candor and Ge∣nerosity
of the several Eminent Members that
compose Your whole Society: Who as They at first
surpriz'd me by Their unmerited unexpected Kind∣ness;
so They now render me sollicitous by what
degrees of Sobriety, Honesty, and Industry, I may
deserve Their Favours.
Give me leave Gentlemen to assure You; That
I go Abroad with Courage and Resolution to answer,
as far as I am able, All those weighty Ends, to
which Your Free Choice, and Gods Providence, have
determin'd my Endeavours. I quickly hope to serve
You in that Antient Seat of Christianity, which
will It self constantly excite me to a Conscientious
Performance of my Duty. And another fresh En∣couragement
I shall receive from those great Ex∣amples,
by which You have there Honour'd and
Adorn'd Your Native-Country. I am,
Right Worshipful, &c.
