RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
I Might well perceiue by the Author, that this Sermon was neuer intended to be pub∣lished, in any other Language than that wherein it was first spoken: being in respect of the matter, in a sort appropriate to that Auditory wherein it was deliuered; But besides the common desire of many, fin∣ding the translation attempted by diuers, and performed by some in such a manner as did not altogether sa∣tisfie; It pleased my Father herein to improue my leasure, where∣in, howsoeuer I may haue somewhat failed of the first elegancy, yet I haue not beene far short of the sense. I haue presumed to dedicate the same to your Lordship, in respect of your many fauours, and my obligations, for which (besides this officious, though vnequall re∣quitall) I shal still vow my prayers for your Lordship, and remaine.
