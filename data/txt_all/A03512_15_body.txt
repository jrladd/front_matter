NOr let the vulgar sway Opinion beares
(Rare Lord) that Poesies fauor shewes men vaine,
Ranke you amongst her sterne disfauourers;
She all things worthy fauour doth maintaine.
Vertue, in all things else, at best she betters;
Honour she heightens, and giues Life in Death;
She is the ornament, and soule of letters:
The worlds deceipt before her vanisheth.
Simple she is as Doues, like Serpents wise;
Sharpe, graue, and sacred: nought but things diuine,
And things diuining, fit her faculties;
(Accepting her as she is genuine.)
If she be vaine then, all things else are vile;
If vertuous, still be Patrone of her stile.
