THE Apostle to the
Philippians, chap. 4.
v. 15. giveth them
this high commenda∣tion,
None commu∣nicated
with me concerning giv∣ing
and receiving, but ye onely▪
Should I apply the same in relation
of my selfe to your Ladyship, I

should be injurious to the Bountie of
many my Worthy Benefactours.
How-ever (not exclusively of others,
but) eminently I must acknowledge
you a Grand Encourager of my Stu∣dies.
In publique testimonie whereof,
I present these my Endeavours to
your Ladiships Patronage.
Indeed they were Preached in an
eminent Place, when I first entred
into the Ministerie, above twentie
yeares since, and therefore you will
pardon the many Faults that may be
found therein. Nor were they intend∣ed
for publique view, till understand∣ing
the Resolution of some of my
Auditors to Print them (to their Pro∣fit,
but my Prejudice) by their
imperfect Notes, I adventured on
this seasonable prevention.
The Lord make his Graces flow
plentifully from the Head of your
Family, your Religious Husband,
to the lowest Skirts thereof, the last
and least of your Relations,
