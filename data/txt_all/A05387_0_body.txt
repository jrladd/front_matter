RIght Honourable Lorde;
The gratious and well de∣seruing,
when they die,
leaue behind them a repu∣tation
that can neuer die.
I instance this in Queene Elizabeth of
blessed memory: A Lady beyond example,
beautifyed with the ornaments of Grace
and Nature (the twoo handes of God)
whose name (like the aire) is spread ouer

all the earth, whereby this our little world
(the English nation) is made famous to
all posteritie. And because I my selfe haue
seene many the admirations of her time,
& haue with many others shared in par∣ticipation
of those blessings which God
did giue her most gratious and fortunate
gouernement; I haue therefore (willing∣ly)
forced my endeuours to this demon∣stration
of thankes, hauing euer vowed
my selfe a seruant to her Honourable re∣membrance.
The reasons (my good L.)
of dedication are these: First, your Lord∣ships
honorable deseruing, in being a prin∣cipall
Supporter of the leaning State of
learning, the Moecenas and Patron of
the learned (in what deseruing qualitie
soeuer:) wherein, (though I be but meane∣ly
profest) yet, your Lordeships zealous
regard to the profession I beare, shal euer
binde me in the most assured bonds of du∣tie

and thankefull seruice. Againe, that
honorable testimony of your Lordships re∣garde,
euen to the very name of your late
Soueraigne, approued by the generall ap∣plause
and acclamation of all good people:
by which act, your Lordship hath procee∣ded
to the highest degree of good opinion,
and by giuing Honour to her that best de∣serued
it, deseruedly made your selfe much
honoured.
And therefore (my good Lord) haue
I ventured on your Lordships gratious ac∣ceptance,
humbly requesting your Honor,
that my particular (howsoeuer vnworthy,
to trauaile in so honorable an Argument)
may (notwithstanding) haue gratious ac∣ceptation,
being presented in the name of
Queene Elizabeth, to whose honorable
remembraunce your Lordeship is so much
deuoted, and to whose name I haue prin∣cipally
dedicated this seruice: beseech∣ing

Almightie God to deriue vppon your
Name and House, a perpetuall Suc∣cession
of Honour and good Fortune.
