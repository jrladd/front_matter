Madam,
THE two great Offi∣ces of Magni∣ficence,
are to do great things where there is no desert to merit the per∣formance; and to accept of small returns where there is no worth to challenge and
acceptance.
There is boun∣ty and charity in the one, and humility and meekness in the other: you have been ve∣ry free and a∣ctive towards former in those
many & great favours, you have bestowed upon one that is so unworthy. And now I am bold to offer you an occasi∣on to exercise the noblenesse of your dispo∣sition
in the latter, in the Present of this poor acknow∣ledgment unto your Honour in the Dedica∣tion of this small piece of devotion unto you. The love
that you beare unto the ser∣vice of God, to the promotion whereof it is designed; and the tender re∣spect you have manifested un∣to the Author, gives me so
good assurance of a fair admis∣sion hereof un∣to your hands, that I do with confidence cast and leave all the faults and imperfections thereof at your mercy: It hath
bin twice pub∣lished already, & hath found so much of en∣tertainment a∣broad; as hath been enough to encourage a third Editi∣on; wherein it hath received
some enlarge∣ment, and though it may yet want growth to render it ser∣viceable to you, yet I hope it may receive some power from the coun∣tenance
of your Honou∣rable Patro∣nage to be in∣strumental to the Good of others; which is Humbly im∣plored by him, who is exceed∣ingly obliged
to remain,
Madam,
