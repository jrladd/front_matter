Madam,
IT is not, because you were pleas'd to be very kind to this Play, when it was act∣ed; for I know not whether you ever honour'd it with your Presence: Nor is it to return you a troublesome acknowledgment for Favours; for I am sure you do not know me: Nor the hope of obliging you to my future ad∣vantage; for the utmost return I expect is your pardon; None of these has made me guilty of this presumption. But since a Play in print, without an Epistle Dedicatory, is now like a Mo∣dish Gallant without a Mistriss, or a Papist with∣out
 a tutelar Saint, I resolv'd to obey Custom in making a Dedication, and my own free inclinati∣on in the choice of your Excellent Self, at whose Feet I humbly lay this; wherein, though my rash Boldness may be censur'd, I'm sure my Prudence will be applauded: For if this Censorious Age will submit to the most perfect Beauty, or the greatest Goodness in the World, under your Pro∣tection it will be safe.—Nature almost overcome by Art, has in your Self rally'd all her scatter'd Forces, and on your charming Brow, sits smiling at the slavish toyls which yours and her envious Foes endure; striving in vain with the fading weak supplies of Art, to rival your Beauties; which are ever the same, and alwayes incomparable. Notwithstanding this great Truth is celebrated by All that know you; You still are Mistriss of so much obliging Affability, so free from sullen Pride, and affected Stateliness, the usual Atten∣dants of extraordinary Felicity; not contented to be safe in the barren praise of doing no ill, but so readily and so frequently doing good, as if it were not your Nature, but your Business; that, next to your Beauty, these Virtues are the great∣est
 Miracle of the Age. If I am the first that has taken the boldness to tell you this, in Print, 'tis because I am more ambitious than all others, to be known by the Title of,
Madam,
