IF I had been
forgetfull of a
willyng pro∣mes
made for
a gifte, I
thoughte too
presente you
withall (not∣withstandyng
tyme lappyng vpp
many matters preuented me) yet
your courtesies towardes my self,
as generally to the worlde where
you like, commaunded me to re∣member
what I had spoken, in ef∣fect
not perfourmed. And further,
your iuste and honest life (wheron
good credite & worship hath wai∣ted)
a double occasion gaue me to
present you some matter worthie
to bee seen of many, because your
eyes and iudgement not alone, but
with noble companie (your hono∣rable
brother sir Willyam Drurie the
cheef) haue pitied the miserie of mē

y• lately by desarte are in disgrace,
and namely the rebellion of those
that thought theim selues, bothe
wise and honourable. So for a
welcome home from soile, where
sedition hath been to often seen, I
committe this my simple gifte to
your protection and well likyng,
and what is spok entherin, God &
good men maie defende, though it
wanted a sufficient patron to ma∣intaine
and manifest a troth, thus
reioysyng in the continuaunce of
your accustomed vertues, I trou∣ble
you no further, but desire you
to read that followeth, and fauor
and countenaunce the same, as
our vpright iudgement
shall leade you.
