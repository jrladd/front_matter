MY Lord, I may perhaps bee thought, besides the boldnesse, to be guilty of absurdity; in offering a Translation to him, who so exactly understandeth the Originall; and one, who if hee had a minde to see how it would looke in Eng∣lish (were able to st a much fairer glosse upon it, then I have done: yet my Lord, this absurdity may have a good colour; for it may not be unpleasing to you, to see your owne perfection, in the glasse of anothers imperfection, seeing even the best Dia∣monds, seeme to take a pleasure in having of foiles. Besides, I have my choice of ano∣ther colour, for being to passe a world of

hazard, in the Censure of the world; I am willing to passe the Pikes at first, and ac∣count this done, having once passed yours. And towards it my Lord, I have two Com∣forts; One for the Reader; that the Au∣thours Gold, is so much over waight, that though much be lost in the melting, yet it holds waight enough still, to make it be cur∣rant. The Other for my selfe; that by this meanes I may have a Testimony remaining in the world, how much I honour you; and in how high a degree, I most affectionately am,
