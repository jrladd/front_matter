FAire and vertuous Mistres, since first it was my good fortune to bee a witnesse of the many rare perfections wherewith nature and education haue adorned you, I haue beene forced since that time, to attribute more admiration to your sexe, then euer Petrarch could before perswade mee to by the praises of his Laura. Sweete is the French tongue more sweete the Italian; but most sweete are they both, if spoken by your admired selfe. If Poesie were praise∣lesse, your vertues alone were a subiect sufficient to make it esteemed, though among the barbarous Getes: by how much the more your tender yeeres giue scarcely warrant for your more then womanlike wisedome, by so much is your iudge∣ment and reading the more to be wondred at. The Graces shall haue one more sister by your selfe, and England to her selfe shall adde one Muse more to Muses. I rest the hum∣ble deuoted seruant, to my deere and modest Mistresse, to whom I wish the happiest fortunes I can deuise.
