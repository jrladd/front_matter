My Lords,
THE following Treatise, together with the state of the Case annex'd to it, is Humbly Presented to your Lordships, to whom it properly belongs; the Subject matter of both, relating to that Supream Jurisdiction in Cases of Appeals from Courts of Equity which is exer∣cis'd by your Lordships, as being the last Resort: Your Lordships being also the true and just Moderators in all Disputes between other Courts in points of Jurisdiction; you having the Coercive and Directive Power of keeping the rest of the Courts within their due Bounds, set them by the Law and Constitution of the Nation, that they do not Overflow their Banks, nor Usurp nor Encroach one upon another.
Your Lordships besides, have a more peculiar Right and Title to the Service of the Composer of this Treatise, who hath had the Honour to serve your Lordships for some Years, and in several Parliaments, in an Eminent Sta∣tion, and with a large Testimony and favourable Accep∣tance from your Lordships, as appears by that hearty and kind Address which your Lordships made on his behalf; besides his ordinary Attendance and Assistance as one of the Judges, which he began about Four and twenty years since.


If what he hath written seem too free and plain, he hopes he is excuseable, the Necessity and Importance of the Case so requires: And he may be allowed a more than com∣mon Zeal for the Common Law, he having sat so many Years as a Judge in several of the Courts in West∣minster-Hall; he himself, and his Three immediate Ancestors, having been of the Profession for near Two hun∣dred Years, and in Judicial places; and (through the Blessing of Almighty God) have Prospered by it. His Great Grandfather living in the time of King Hen∣ry VII. and they all have, in their several turns, un∣dergone the Charge and Labour of Readers of Lincolns-Inn.
And your Lordships, and your Noble Ancestors have always, and upon many great Occasions, constantly Testi∣fied a true and hearty Zeal for the Common Law of England; as will largely be manifested by this Treatise, and the Conclusion of the stated Case annexed to it.
The only Design of this Treatise, being meerly to Assist and Serve your Lordships, in your Discharge of that Mighty Trust reposed in your Lordships; to whom the Trea∣tise and Case is entirely submitted, by
My Lords,
