And that you may still keep the Unity of the Spi∣rit in the Bond of Peace, growing exceedingly and sensibly in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, shining with the bright Beams of Holiness to the Adorning of your Profession: And that you may meet with God in Ordinances here to your Comfort and Improvement, and after that have a full Enjoyment of him, and immediate Communion with him in his Heavenly Kingdom for ever, is and shall be the hearty Pray∣er of him who is
 From my Study, Nov. 14, 1692.
