MY LORD,
YOur Lordship having been pleased to honour me with a Testimonial under your Episcopal Seal (besides a Letter to his Grace my Lord of Canterbury) of my Beha∣viour for about ten Years in your Lordships late Diocese of Bath and Wells, when I remo∣ved thence to the Place where I now am; I should justly have been condemn'd, had those scandalous Reports, which are rais'd concerning me, been true, as the vilest and most ungrateful Wretch living, appearing so unworthy of, and contrary to the Character your Lordship was pleas'd to give me, pro∣ving at once a disobedient Son to your good
Lordship, (to whom I must acknowledge my self to stand, in many instances, more particu∣larly obliged) and a disloyal Subject to the Best of Kings.
This, my Lord, is the reason of my inscri∣bing to your Lordship's Name the following plain Discourse (calculated for a common Auditory) which I am even forc'd out of pure necessity to make publick (and therefore humbly beg that it may shelter it self under your Lordship's Patronage) to stop the mouth of a flying Scandal, which has wounded my Reputation, and that the Truth may appear, and the World be satisfied how unjustly my Sermon preached at St. Michael's Crooked Lane, London, Octob. 26. ult. was reflected on, and represented as Treasonable and Seditious, and reproaching the Government and the Courts of Justice: A heavy Charge and Im∣putation! which, I doubt not, Good Men (when undeceiv'd) will conclude to be false, and that I am notwithstanding a true and Loyal Subject to the King, the rather, be∣cause

Decemb. 10. 1684.
