GENTLEMEN, there are but fewe in
these dayes, that are willing to heare
their faultes: but they are fewer by a
great number that are willing to amend
them, Find faults, could neuer yet get
grace, for Adulation is crept so closely
into our bosomes, that smoothing Flat∣terie
is more dearely esteemed, then re∣prehending
Veritie.
I confesse my selfe to be ill beholding
to mine owne tongue, that could neuer flatter, lispe, nor lye: Na∣ture
hath made the carriage of my words to bee something harsh
and dull, yet when they seeme to be most slow, perhaps sometimes
they be most sure: I speake plainely, & I meane honestly: and al∣though
my wordes bee not imbroydered with high morality, I care
not: for I leaue that to Schollers, Maisters of Art and Methode.
If my lynes be plaine and true, they so much the more resemble
their Sier, and for children to bee like their Parentes, besides the
Midwife will giue it a blessing, so it is a signe they be Legitimate: de∣fectes
I know they cannot want, that in their procreation were bred
and borne before their time, for as I conueyued of them in an in∣stant,
so I was deliuered againe in a moment: and these abortiue
brates that are thus hastely brought into the world, though they
seldome prooue to haue any great vigor or strength, yet I hope
these will proue to be of as honest and plaine dealing as their father.
I make no doubt but they will please as many as I desire to con∣tent,
and those are Good men, and Vertuous women: for the rest
that are gauled, if I rubbe them vnawares, it is but Chance-medly,
and then I hope I shall obtaine a pardon of Course, prote∣sting
aforehand that I haue not aymed at any one par∣ticularly
that hath not a guiltie conscience to ac∣cuse
himselfe: if any man will thinke them
to be too bitter, let him vse it as an
Apothecaries pill, that the more
bitter, the better
purging.
