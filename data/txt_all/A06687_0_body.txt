WOorshipfull Sir, it hath been an olde and ancient adadge, and that vbi{que} in generalitie confir∣med, namely, that good will may be blamed by some curious car∣pers, that with Gorgon belch forth their venome against the simple, but to excuse such as meane well, Hope to beate downe feare and to ouerthrowe dispaire, setteth in her foote, to animate the vertuous to perseuer and goe forward in their well dooinges, confirming the old approued prouerb, with this assertion, (though trueth may be blamed saith she, yet shall good will in trueth be neuer ashamed: thus in this cause Hope is an instruemēt sent from the heauens, stoppeth the mouths of monstrous Momus, oppresseth the outrage of Zoilus, and giueth to the honest and good minded, a corsselet of proofe to in∣counter against the ceaseles scandalls of the wicked: This hope of your good liking, hath made me bold to acquaint and deliuer into your hands this small pamphlet, namely, Phillippes Ʋenus, but to present Apollo with Pans Oaten Pipe, or Diana with a Distaffe, it were a thing ridiculous, but hope pleadeth good will, and saith your wisdome wil franckly condiscend to couer the defectes, that through mine vnskilfulnes shall heerein be coutched. Sinates deli∣uered the Persian King Artaxerxes a handfull of faire water, which his soueraigne thankfully receiued, I in re∣spect of his gift, come vnto you with a gift far inferiour,

and yet I assure you my good wil striueth to counteruaile his curtesie, but had I the precious pearles of Patroclus, or the golden Sandes of Ganges: I could finde in my hart to make you the owner of them, as wel as I haue chosen you to be the patron of my trauaile, vnder whose buckler of defence I haue cōmitted my Book to the printers presse, but because I will obserue decorum, and auoide teadious∣nes, this sinode and solemne parliament holden of the Gods and Goddesses in sacred Olympus, shall reueale a plain and simple method, the occasion and effect of Phil∣lips Ʋenus, the which as time and leasure, setting aside your searious affaires, shall permit you, I am fullye per∣swaded you will throughly peruse and reade: that doon, I trust you will giue your censure in such sorte, that heere∣after I may be incouraged to publish some other treatise, which may further delight you. Thus leauing you to the mercifull and gratious protection of the almighty, I bid you most hartily farwell.
