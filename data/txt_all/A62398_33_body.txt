MOst worthy Sir, according to my Dream,
Into this Pamphlet remains to be seen,
I hope your goodness will allow,
That I dedicat Walter Grieve to you,
He is a true and honest man,
He's both your Neighbour, and Shepherds Swain,
One dedication might have serv'd for all,
VVhat I have said before, to mention it again,
It is a needless labour, and puts the writer to more pain;
I wish ye miekle joy of all your Golden Pieces,
And like to Walter Grieve with increase of his Fleeces.
