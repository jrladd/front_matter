Honorable Sir,
I Hope You will not conceive that I hold any Compliance with the scribling humour of this age, or that as dark as I am, I should so little see into my self, as not to know my rude and undigested Labours un∣worthy publick light: When I first design'd within my self the composure of this ensuing Poem, my Thoughts were not in the least ten∣dency for a Publication; yet through the per∣swasion of some Friends (whose better judge∣ments I could not but value above mine own private Opinion) I have sont my unfledg'd Muse abroad into the World, humbly as∣suming
the boldness to shrowd it under the wing of Your Honours Protection, assuring my self it will find the better welcom for the name of the Patron. Sir, This small Manuel, I confess, comes towards you untrimmed, its Innocency being its best Dress, and its Poetry lying more in Feet than Fancy; yet is it Or∣thodox, I hope, and Theologically substantial: The subject matter is Divine, answering Your Affections; Sublime, not unbeseeming Your Personage; most Necessary, and therefore not unworthy Your serious Thoughts. And for the Meanness of the Author, the Heathen man pleads for me; Non quis, sed quid dicit at∣tendito, not who speaks, but what is spoken ought to be considered. This little Volume, as it proceeds from me, hath not the least en∣forcement of a Tolle, lege, written upon it, yet (not to disown the in-comings of Divine as∣sistance) like the stone Garamantides, habet intus Aureas guttas, it hath Golden Drops within it self, enriching the believing Soul with a lively hope of a blissful immortality. My principal inducement of Dedicating this to Your Honor, is, the remembrance of und∣served Favours, which challenge more than
an airy Complement at my hands. The sing a∣lar Love and Respect You bore to my good Father while he lived, and the real Testimony of Your continued Affection to my self, hath engaged my most active Thoughts to study something which may in some measure render me sensible of both; These few lines therefore, the first Fruits of my weaker Attainments of this Nature, I present with all Humility to Your Acceptance, in hope that as they may prove a Mite cast into the Treasure of GOD'S glory and the publick good, so they will signifie to Your Honour a Mind sensible of, and a Heart thankeful for the many free and noble Favours vouchsafed to my Relations and my Self. Sir, I am very confident Your judicious Eye may running read many rude unpolish't Lines in this Draught of Eternity; and there∣fore I make it my humble Request, That as the Painter of old drew Alexander with his finger upon his defective Eye; So Your known Can∣dour would put a favourable gloss upon my im∣perfections, and dash out my Errata by a cha∣ritable connivence. In the confidence whereof I shall only raise the Application of my humble Suite to Almighty God, That he would make
You no less faithful in, than able for his Ser∣vice, that after You have had a glimpse of his glory in the Kingdom of Grace. You may have a fulness of his grace in the Kingdom of Glory; with the which Thoughts upon my Heart in the best seasons of my Soul, I shall be ever ready to approve my self
