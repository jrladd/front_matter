AT the first coming abroad of the three former of these Novels in Eng∣lish, they were ad∣dress'd to you, partly upon this accompt, that they were rendred into that Language at Cumberlow, it being but just you should have the Patronage, of what had its birth under your roof. The lightness of the Subject might indeed have deterr'd me, from presixing before it, a Name, which will challenge veneration,

till that of Philosophy have lost the respect due to it, and the world be re-involv'd in Ignorance and Barbarism: but my presum∣ption on the kindnesses you were pleas'd to have for me, and the earnestness I had to make some publick acknowledgment of my extraordinary obligations to you, overcame that difficulty.
When the Books of the former Edition were nigh spent, and that I was call'd upon, to provide for another, it was again my fortune, after almost two years retirement in Wales, to come to your House, where I had the opportunity, to review what was printed, and make what additions I could thereto, out of the same Author's works. So that the same reason, which I had, at first, to make, obliges me to continue, the Dedication of these Pieces to you; but with this advantage now, that I am the less sollicitous of their fate, since the entertain∣ment, some of them have already found, is such, as hath encourag'd the Book-seller to venture at a Second Impression.
But if these were not sufficient, I have several other motives, which would not

suffer me to decline the doing of what I am now upon, but particularly one, whence I derive the greatest satisfaction imaginable, which is, that, by this Address, all those who love, that is, all who know you, will be assur'd, of your having o'rcome a Sickness, which begat a general report of your death.
And this reflection, me-thinks, may well dispence a little, with my retreat into the style of the antient Dedicatories, which were commonly concluded with wishes and prayers. Mine are, at the present, that, for some time yet, we may not have the occasion to bemoan the loss of so precious a life as yours; That the Health you have so happily recover'd may have an uninterrupted continuance for many years; And when you are cloy'd with the enjoy∣ments and happiness of this world, (which, as you are wont to express it, consist in these three words, Wife, Children, Friends) you may, by the attendance of those Learned men, whose Labours all subsequent Ages will be oblig'd to, be convey'd into the joys and bliss of another. And I doubt not of my having, after so long acquaintance, so much

credit with you, as that, when I am devour, you will believe me sincere, and, conse∣quently, that these are the hearty wishes of,
HONOURED SIR,
