Gentlemen,
THOUGH I love not Con∣troversies, nor have a strength of Judgment to manage them, yet I readily embraced the motion of Answering a small Tract, Entituled, An Essay on the East-India Trade,
by the Author of the Essay upon Ways and Means; believing the Justness of the Cause would supply the Weakness of the Advocate. I must own the Author of that Essay hath set forth his Er∣rors in Trade, as usually they come forth in Religion, with the Allurements of Sublimer Knowledge, and more ad∣vanc'd Practice in the Mysteries of Heaven, than are Taught by the Ancient Orthodox Discipline; so this Gentleman Argues for the Importation and Wear of East-India Manufactories to be the highest Improvement of our Trade and Navigation; the mistake whereof the following Sheets explode. I therefore only mention here that which perfects the Simile before-men∣tioned, That his Position is Erroneous and New; the East-India Trade ha∣ving been Profitable to the Nation before the vast Importation of Indian Manufactories, and the contrary now
the Nation is deluded by the Gaiety and Cheapness of them, as it is im∣posed upon when they are told, That they are a great Improvement to Trade, and below the exalted Genius of a Rich Nation, as we are, to take up with Home-bred Manufactories; all this I take to be a most pernicious Heresy in Trade, and submit my Ar∣guments in the following Pages to prove it so, to the Consideration of better Heads.
I shall add no more here, but pray your leave to caution against a fault too general in our Nation, that is, To treat Men that differ with us in Judgment, as Enemies either to our Persons or Interest; this often makes some so that were not, but never brings over them that are.
I know some of the first Magni∣tude,
both in Quality and Judgment, of different Opinion in the East-In∣dia Trade, yet as entirely in the In∣terest of the Nation, as we that differ from them in this Point.
If I may presume to advise you, and that you gain your reasonable desire, use it as a Victory only over the Subjects of the Mogul, and not over your Brethren.
