WHen Fa∣bius was asked who was a good Orator,
he said he would give the same answer, which the Stoicks would give if this question were pro∣pounded to them con∣cerning Zeno, Cle∣anthes, or Chrisip∣pus, whom they e∣steemed great and worthy men; but not such as had obtained the height of which human nature is ca∣pable.

The same I con∣fess of you, ye have made large progres∣ses in the school of wisdom, and many of you have almost reached the topp of human capacity, but yet ye have not obtai∣ned pure wisdom: And truly, I fear as the old Platonists confessed of them∣selves, yee will never
reach it till your souls final separati∣on: when she will to her loss finde where she mist her footing, except yee would (which were a noble design) maugre the injuries of the time and place where ye live, life up your eyes, and conclude with E∣pictetus , our aim shall
be to seek God with a pure Soul. This can∣not be done unless without any limitati∣on ye submit to these  &  to those commanding Oracles (as the Ancients call them) which God by his holy Spouse pro∣poundeth to our obe∣dience; to this end it is first necessary to know which is the on∣ly
Church, whence all wisdom as from a pure source flowes: to this the ensuing discourse will inable the Reader.
