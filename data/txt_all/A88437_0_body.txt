SIR,
THese first Fruits with bending humility, stoops to be pluckt by your sweet hand; and tast∣ed by the good relish of
your favorable acceptance; and if they have but the ho∣nour to pearch on the least branch of your noble mind, it is all I crave from the seat of your juditious approba∣tion; and though I boldly knit the thread of my La∣bour to your noble name, yet the great affections I ow, and the greater your merits demand; emboldens me to conclude, That as your incomparable worth is my encourager, so will it as easily pardon as beget this boldness. Therefore it is, that with strong presum∣ption of your genuine in∣terpretation,
this peice takes Sanctuary under the refreshing shelter of your noble Patronage, from the scorching heat of malitious censure. May you be dire∣cted to tread the steps of your brave Progenitors, e∣specially to trace the Re∣nowned walks of the Right Honourable your noble Fa∣ther; whose valour for his Countrey, and immoveable constancy to a good cause, may stand as a pattern of I∣mitation to future ages, and challenge a Room among the truly worthy: Thus noble Sir go on, that as in
your younger years you have stamped your actions in the mint of virtue, ther∣by coyning Renown as an inseperable adjunct to your great parts; so may you by continuance in the same Tract, cut out to your self a habitation in the hearts of all that love and honor vir∣tue. So sitting in the lap of Prosperity, it may at last be sanctified in order to eter∣nity. And may the hopeful promises of your lively and capacious Soul inlaid with Gallantry, so fructifie, that they may struggle with your years for growth, and
fill the longing world with expectation. Now Sir since I have boldly begun, let me humbly end, ingeniously confessing my self in a great degree unfortunate, in hav∣ing no nobler a sacrifice, to offer at the shrine of so much Honour and Virtue: All I request is, that I may march under the Banner and conduct of your favour and commands; For I am,
Noble Sir,
