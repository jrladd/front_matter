MY LORD, and GENTLEMEN:
To whom should A Tract of Peace bee presented for Protection, but to the Preservers of the Peace; in which respect (were there no other Cause for it) this Dedication cannot be judged a Solecisme, but this is not the only ground of this Presumption: No! these Lines (though not sounded in your eares yet) are laid be∣fore your Eyes, as an humble and thankfull Testimony; that what in your publike Sessions of the Peace was by Mr. Re∣corder propounded, and perswaded; and by the paines and great trouble of you, my LORD, and Mr. Sheriffes, endeavou∣red, hath been at length effected: Wherein though the per∣versness of my adversaries, prevented your intentions, and my desires, for your putting a period to our unhappie Differen∣ces: yet I and my Friends must needs acknowledge, you were not the least instrumentall, in enforcing it; For my Lord, and Gentlemen, the very countenance of men of Place is of great concernment in matters of Controversie: Some my Lord (who lately sate in your Lordships chaire) indulging falshood, violence, and vanity, did not a little abet, and a∣nimate the disturbers of my Peace; and so necessitate mee unto the defence of my own integrity, and interest by waies more answerable to the impudence of the opposition made against me, then my own naturall Genious: But your Lord∣ship and Worships no sooner gave in our Cause, the least pub∣like
 testimony of your propensity unto justice, but the Scales were brought into an equipoise, that I might stand on even Ground to expostulate the insolencies and injuries of Men against men, God is my witnesse, and many good men know how earnestly I desired, and how eagerly I sought Peace with them whom I never wronged, and who never could in way of justice doe me more hurt then put me on a vexatious defence; yet whilest by arbitrary power, and extrajudiciall processe they could oppresse me, seemed to have Peace and would none of it, I beleeve (my Lord and Gentlemen) your observation of my willingnesse to procure peace, by pardo∣ning all past wrongs, being but provided for as to future order, and secured from future violence and disturbance, as likewise of that Spirit of disorder and rudenesse, by which my Adversaries were acted, together with your favourable expression of your sence of the Iustice of my demands, up∣on the submission made unto you had that influence on them as to incline them not only to seeke Peace, but to accept it on much harder termes, I was willing you should have made for them: So that the causes they constrained me to bring into your Courts came no more before you, save to be dismissed, so that our Peace (which occasioned these Instructions) is hereby returned to you from whom it sprang, having beene first propounded, and at after pursued by you, though concluded among our selves: Moreover this duty of pursuing Peace is so profitable to our Citty and Nation, and now so generally pretended to that it be∣comes worthy your Patronage, the which he doubts not to obtaine, who is —
My LORD and GENTLEMEN,
 LONDON Algate.
