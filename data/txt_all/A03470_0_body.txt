IMage of God; first as a Man, and then
As King, by most Desert, and onely Right:
Man is the King of Creatures, and thy might
Exceedes this too, for thou art King of men.
Sunne of our Sphaeie, may neuer Clowde vp pen
So radiant Beames from thy poore Subiects sight:
That still our Eyes may see their happy Light,
Eu'n as their Heate did warme our Bosoms, when
Vnseene they shone beneath the fixed Star.
Vp Noble Minde to thy fift Empirie,
And some yet higher then thy fortunes ar:
Resemble Heau'n in all but Leuitie,
Take after Earth in nothing more or lesse
Except an irremooued Stayednesse.
