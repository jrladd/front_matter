Mr. SPEAKER,
ALthough the Designes of this Age do tend, as I am verily perswaded, to a thorough Reformation; yet hitherto we cannot see much more then the Overthrow and Deformation of former Establishments: partly, because there is much rubbish to be removed; partly, because it is not

possible to build a new House where an old one is stand∣ing, till the old one be pulled down. Yet no wise man will lay his old habitation waste, till he know what to erect instead thereof: Hence it is, that a New Modell is common∣ly first prepared before the old one be removed. I know not how far this Course hath been taken by others, but in the Sphere wherein I have walked, my Aime hath been ra∣ther to take away the Difficulties then to lay them open, ra∣ther to suggest a Remedie then to discourse of the Disease; for there is no end of Complaints on all hands, seeing each Party doth lay open the others faults; and few or none tell us, how they ought to be mended. For indeed it is easier to see a mote or a web in another mans eye, then to take it out, and most men think themselves justified, when they have condemned others, whose way is different from that which they have Chosen. And although this seems to be in all other matters the Ordinary Practice; yet in the Wayes of Education, and the Reformation of Schools (the deepest foundation of all other good Settlement both in Church and Common-wealth) it hath not been followed hitherto. But my honoured Friend Mr. John Amos Comenius, and some other Fellow-labourers and Correspondents in this Work with my self, have studied to make as little Alteration

as could be, seeking onely the best Advantages which upon the Ordinary Foundations of School-teaching could be in∣troduced: and in this Endeavour for a great many years we have Continued, and many wayes attempts have been made to facilitate the Course of Universall Learning, and especi∣ally the teaching of Learned Tongues; and to abridge the time which is spent, and to ease the toil which is taken there∣in: but when all is done, we finde after long experience, that it will be impossible to raise a Firme and Commodious Building upon the Old Foundation; for which Cause I must needs shew now the weaknesse and defaults thereof. And because it is no small difficultie and hazard to venture upon the contradicting of a Custome so Universally re∣ceived, as is the Grammatical Tyranny of teaching Tongues; Therefore I am willing to make an Appeal, and seek out an Eminent Patron for this bold Attempt, not doubting that Your Impartiall Judgement, not wedded to things, because they are Customary and received, will look into this thing with a more single eye, to discern the truth of that which is offered, then others can do, that are either so far engaged unto the Road-way, that they will not think of any better

Course to be taken; or suspect all New Designes as light Projects of unsetled braines: but I hope Your Solid Judge∣ment and large Experience of my constant behaviour will absolve me from the guilt of Levity, in prosecuting all the Wayes whereby Learning may be advanced. Seeing it hath been a great part of my Study above these twenty years; nor have I been alone in this Work, but many others of great Worth and Abilities, have been obliged to contri∣bute their help unto me. Nor is it the Scope of this Trea∣tise (wherein others speak more then I) so much to over∣throw what is in use, as to introduce a Better, Easier, and Readier Way of Teaching: But how to Introduce the Way which is here intimated into the Publique Schools of this Common-wealth, will be a matter of further delibera∣tion then is fit for me now to enter upon; it may be hoped, that the Honourable Committee for the Advancement of Learning, will be inclined to reflect upon this matter, and consider the feasablenesse thereof: and haply something as a Proposall in this Kinde may be offered unto them; wherein Your Grave Recommendation to set their thoughts a work∣ing may have a special influence in due time; Therefore, lest I

might seem at this time troublesome more then is needful, I shall take my leave, and humbly subscribe my self ver,
