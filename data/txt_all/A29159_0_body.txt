Madam,
THe many undeserved favours I have received from your Ladyship, and the dependance which I have upon your Illustrious Brother, exact the largest acknow∣ledgments that I am capable of making, and give you a just title to whatever I can call
mine. But you have still a more peculiar right to the following Discourse, which was preached and published by your express com∣mand, occasioned by that loss in which you share so greatly; and designed to asswage that excessive Sorrow, which a reflection upon it was too apt to excite, in so true a Mourner as your Ladyship. I question not, but that greatness of Soul, and firmness of Mind, which are na∣tural to the blood from which you are descend∣ed, together with that exemplary and unaffect∣ed Piety, which recommended you to the Friendship of the best of Princesses, will now give you their Assistance when you most need it; and enable you to support that Tryal with moderation, which would oppress a weaker Courage, and break a Spirit less re∣signed. For your Ladyship has not so learn∣ed Christ, as to struggle ineffectually under the Cross, when he is pleased to lay it on; or to think, that infinite Wisdom and unbound∣ed
Goodness can deal hardly by us, let the tem∣ptations which encompass us be never so great; such indeed was that unspeakable affliction, with which God has lately been pleased to visit us: the sudden and unexpected loss of a Prin∣cess, who was not only the delight of the Eyes, but the Joy too of the Hearts of all her Subjects; a Princess whose Character I dare not attempt, for fear of lessening it; in whom the Conjugal affection of the first Ed∣ward's Eleanor, the undaunted magnanimi∣ty of the third Edward's Philippa, with the Religious Zeal, and prudent Government of our late famous Elizabeth, were happily uni∣ted and improved; and to whom King Le∣muel's Eulogy might justly be applied, Ma∣ny Daughters have done Vertuously, but thou excellest them all. But whither is my indiscreet Zeal transporting me? faint∣ly to enumerate some few of those Graces, with which your Ladyship were so intimately ac∣quainted,
in all their Variety and Perfection? My present business is that of a Comforter, not a Condoler. And if the following discourse can furnish your Ladyship, with some Wea∣pons to combate the greatness of your Grief, (which in such Hands cannot but be success∣ful) it will highly contribute to the joy and satisfaction, of
Madam,
