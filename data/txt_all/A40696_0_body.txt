SIR,
FOR this Tender of my Duty to Your Highness, in a Publick Dedication, I can only make this Plea for my Presumption; viz. by telling You, That the Royal Blood that fills Your Rich Veins, and the whole concentring Hopes of Three King∣doms that wait Your Illustrious Birth, gave You a Court even in Your Cradle; whilst Addressers and

Petitioners were Your Highness's earliest Train of Homagers.
The Restless Endeavours of Rome's too great, and consequently England's too little Friends, have not been wanting (for Religious Frenzy shrinks at nothing) in the most unaccountable Measures for carrying on their sinister Ambition, in the following Ʋnnatural Impo∣sture. But, as hideous as such a vile Conspiracy may appear, 'tis but too reasonable to believe, that the same infatuated Zeal of Popish Bigottry, that can so poorly descend to Commission Ruffians and Cut∣throats, with Daggers and Mus∣quetoons; might as easily with the same stretch of Romish Conscience, stoop to as vile.

in all the Perfections of a most Active and most Promising Youth, the Morning Lustre of the Great Soul, those Paternal Sparks of GLORY, Born with You, and so early Shining from You, whilst Your Highness's young Martial Inclina∣tions even point You out, as form'd by Nature, and design'd by Heaven, for no less than the HEROE. With a Mind so amply furnisht for all the Noblest Impres∣sions of true Honour; may the continued Smiles of Providence, so build upon that fair Foundation so lengthen out Your hap∣py Years, to Your compleating the great work of Your Creation, in all the Accom∣plishments of our Young British Alcides: And as You have already performed the First Herculean, though Infant Labour, in strangling the Conspiring Snakes against You; so may You succeed our Great Nas∣sau, till You arrive at the Last Labour too viz. the supplying our Albion Atlas; which is the Prayer of
