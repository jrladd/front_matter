SIR,
THe manifold courtesies received at you hands, deserveth a far more gratificatÂ¦on than my ability, either the one way  the other is able to give you: yet to b oblivious of all, were trebe ingratitude And therefore to shunne so absurd an error, I hav in my dutifull affection, (laying aside Commic Thaleia) presented to your Worships view, Deat Conquering, that must be Conquered. Although th subject is not correspondent to festivall times, yet to  thought upon at all times: and so in conclusion  time omited. But to make my Wings bigger then  Neast, were rediculous. And therefore in the best  affection, I rest.
