My Lord,
I Have been long doubtful in my thoughts what Sub∣jects to handle under so great a variety of Christian Truths; but I do not doubt in the least where I should fix my Dedication; since your Lordship may challenge
all my endeavours, whether I be barely consider'd as a Mem∣ber of your Diocess, or far∣ther as planted by your self under the noble Influence of your Favour. As a Member, there is due from me all the Reverence of an Esteem: as one planted, there is requisite the peculiar tribute of a thank∣ful mind in a return of some Fruit to your hands.
The Discourses I here offer to your Lordships view, and from thence to the World (how weakly soever they are written) yet I am sure they have weight of matter and worth of Patronage to defend
them. I here open from Scrip∣ture, First, that heynous sin of Imprisoning Truth, and the justness of Gods vengeance re∣veal'd: Next, the natural In∣ference from Divine Promises, which is the exercise of all Piety: Thirdly, the cogent reason of adhering to our Lord Christ, because He has words of Eternal life for his follow∣ers: Last of all, the proper Benefit of his Death in that work of Justifying us, and the Peculiar Advantages of his Rising: In all which points I have strictly confin'd my self within my Circle; and (as oc∣casion led me) reflected upon
Two great Enemies to Chri∣stianity, which are the Papist and the Socinian; the one cry∣ing up his Diana (which is the Church) the other magnifying as false a Goddess (which is his own Reason) to over∣throw it.
I need not here publish your Lordships Zeal for our Prote∣stant Church, which you have abundantly demonstrated to your own Clergy, nor the pru∣dence of your Government, which we all taste of: but since I am made so singular an In∣stance of your kindness both as to present and future encou∣ragement, I take leave to men∣tion
it to the world, and with∣all to acquaint your Lordship, That the great Temptation I had to write was my Sense of it; where I hoped I might e∣rect some lasting Memorial; or (if the poorness of what is written should hinder life,) yet the Candid Reader might give it one by considering your Lordships Name, and the Gra∣titude of the Writer.
