Great SIR,
I Bring to Your Majesty a small Work, a Series of Prescriptions in the Medi∣cal Art, yet possibly the Greatest in its Kind, for Excellency and Ʋsefulness, that ever any Age produced: A Collected Sum∣mary of the Choicest Secrets in Physick yet known; and what all the Professors thereof acknowledge as a Spontaneous Product from the Ʋniversal Stock of Experience.
I have Accomodated it for the Ad∣vantage of all Your Majesty's Subjects, and made its Ʋse as Ʋniversal and Easie, as the Medicaments themselves are Gene∣ral
and Good: Had not the Necessity of such a Work, prevailed with me, I had never put my Hand to this Plough, nor troubled Your Majesty on such an Occasion.
Be pleased therefore, Sir, to cast Your Favourable Eye, on the State of the Pro∣fession of Physick, and in particular on this Book, which thro' your Benignity can∣not go without its hoped for Effects; for that thro' Your Royal Favour, it will not only live now in Estimation and Respect, but stand as a Signal to future Times of Your Majesty's extraordinary Goodness, frustrating the Designs of evil Men.
You have, Sir, rescued us not only from the Jaws of Lions and Paws of Bears, the brutest of Beasts, but from the Insu∣perable Chains of Popery and Slavery, and from the Dreaded Tyranny of Eter∣nal Slaves, the Barbarous French: And restored our dearest Liberties, ravisht from us by Ʋsurpation and Violence, thro' the Malice and Deceit of Treache∣rous and Ambitious Men; who not only ruin'd the Publick by their Follies, but
precipitated themselves from the highest Acme of Glory, to the fathomless Abyss of Dishonour and Contempt.
Thus, Sir, becoming the Glory of the Diadem, and the Majesty of Crowned Heads, You will out-do Royalty it self; and by Your Magnanimity, build such Monuments of Honour, which the Result of utmost Ages shall never deface, nor eternal Times ever wear out or alter.
Were my Abilities to write your Cha∣racter but equal to the Greatness of Your Spirit; and could I but scetch out a faint Idea of Your Glorious Actions, I'd write in Everlasting Lines Your Immortal Life, and depict upon the Curtains of Eternity, not the Shadows of Royalty but the perpetual Substance thereof, powerfully Arm'd with unlimited Good∣ness: A Prerogative that no Prince upon Earth, but Your Majesty, can justly Claim.
May Heaven therefore continue the Suc∣cess of your Arms; and Victory attend You wheresoever You go: May you subdue Tyrants by Your Sword, and vanquish the
Terrible of the Earth, trampling under Your Feet the Destroyers of the World: and being filled with the Spoils of Your Enemies, May You lift up the Standarts of Justice and Truth, and by Your Ʋnresist∣able Power introduce Peace to your People And that a Prosperous Conduct may at∣tend You with Honour and Glory, thro' a long and happy Reign, is the perpetual Prayer of
