MY most loued and best estee∣med Friend, I haue read, that
mongst that little labo∣rious
 Common-wealth of Bees, they haue a law, that if a
Drone hauing lost his sting (which gaue him spirit to labour, because
being ar∣med with that hee was able to encounter with his aduer∣sary) &
now giuing himselfe to sloth, and sucke the honey from the rest, he is
(by a ge∣nerall consent) presently thrust out, and banisht, or put to
death, as an vnprofi∣table member: To auoyde which imputation, I haue
 gathered vp some remnants of time, to meditate vpon
an euerlasting subiect (which is the Soule) a subiect be∣ing
created to serue her im∣mortall King, and euerla∣sting, because a
blessed euer∣lasting life is her reward if she perseuere in her
Creators seruice to the end. I confesse it is a large field, whereon in
expert Artist may frame and build a goodly Cittie;
ut I being but a simple
la∣ourer, dare not presume
to
 speake of Colossus, or build pyramides
(wonders of the world) lest in piercing too high, I meete with
Ba∣bell, and so fall to ruine. Yet as the poore widdow in the
Gospell, amongst the ma∣ny great superfluous gifts did not doubt but her
mite would be accepted; so I doubt not but mongst those many huge vollumes
that swarme in the world, some well-iudging Christian may cast his eye
on my poore
 worke, & so may giue a gen∣tle conclusion,
saying, this poore man hath cast in his Mite into the treasury, and
brought one little stone to the eternall building. To giue a better glosse
to my small commodity, I haue thought good (my deere Friend) to patronize it
vn∣der your protection, coniu∣ring you by all the lawes of friendship, not to
refuse the guardiance of this poore In∣fant, but nourish it with
 your best loue, for which you shall be sure to
finde double requitall; first, you shal bind my poore loue and labour to
your seruice; and last, (which is best) you shall find Gods blessing
to your soule and body; to whose prote∣ction I leaue you, and rest yours,
euer deuoted
