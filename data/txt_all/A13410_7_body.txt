Most Worthy:

YOu that sometimes pleasd graciously t'accept,
Th'imperfect offers of my tongue, I pray
This seruice of my pen you would protect,
I wish no more then you with honor may
Confirme and grant, therefore I hope to speede,
My desire is diuine, and so's my deede.
The Law without the Gospell's too seuere,
Without the Law the Gospell is too mild:



Therefore I'ntreate you with a reuerent feare,
To be the gossips to this diuine child,
And in the forehead of it men shall reade,
Your names and worth when you are lapt in leade.


You that so well affect the life of grace,
Are here inuited to the life of glory,
The Lambe ands Bride in holy loue imbrace,
And of allioyes nam'd in the sacred story,
Possesse the fulnesse, thither you are bidden,
To share those beauties that from earth are hidden.
I'm confident, these poems will come fit
For your suruey, at your most proper leasure,
I know you dearely loue, both arte and wit,
And by a heauenly muse, receiues both pleasure,
And holy profit. Thus my loue commands
My booke with reuerence t'kisse, your noble hands.
