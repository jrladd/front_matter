HAuing great desire (good madame) in some seruiceable sort to dedicate to you a peece of such my honest labors as may merit your Ladi∣ships good liking, I find my selfe so vnable for the same, as in a manner halfe discouraged, I doubted what inuen∣cion I should take in hand, but waieng your vertuous disposition, ioyned with a sweet and courteous kind of

behauiour (that wins the worlds goodwill) I presumed that your Ladiship would not thinke amisse of anie that would honour you in good meaning with such workes of the pen, as becometh an humble writer to present to such a worthie Ladie, so searching my simple storehouse of studies, I found fit for my purpose (though farre vn∣meet for your reading) a dolefull discourse of a haplesse man, penned long a goe to bee looked on, but cast care∣lesly aside, therefore nowe reuiued againe to manifest his misfortunes, that willinglie would not depart the world till his whole pilgrimage were well known to the best sort of people, as the verses that followes shal amply declare, which verses I commit to your ladiships iudge∣ment and viewe, wishing you much honour and good Fortune, with encrease of vertue.
