Madam,
MY Author, having in this his Work represented a Lady, transcendent in all perfections, both of body and minde, in the person of his incomparable Isabella, selected out of all the choisest beauties of France, the great and vertuous Dutches of Rohan, as her nearest parrallel, to dedicate it unto. In imitation of whom I have presumed, from amongst the most accompli∣shed Ladies of England, to make choyce of your Grace to present this Illustrious Princess of Monaco unto, as the true picture of your self, wherein you may behold lively pourtrai'd forth all the many rare, and excellent graces and vertues, wherewith Heaven hath so happily beautified you. Be pleased then, great Dutches, to accept thereof, not according to the un∣worthiness of the presenter, but according to the merit
 of the present, which exhibites to the view of the world, besides many other remarkable passages, all that is most eminently desirable in that Sex, whereof your Grace being one of the chief, will no doubt, out of that innated goodness, and sweetness of dispo∣sition, which is naturally incident thereunto, vouch∣safe graciously to receive this mean, but hearty offe∣ring of
Madam
