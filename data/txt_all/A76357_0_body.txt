Most gracious Soveraigne:
I Your Majesties most humble Petitioner, would rather be a Bond slave among the Turkes, then Your Majesties Free-born man (as I am) to be used as I have been nine yeares together before this Parliament began, at your Councell-board here in Eng∣land: For the courses which were taken against me by the whole Councell board, were more unjust then the ungodly proceedings that were taken against Naboth, in the time of wicked King Ahab, who by false accusation was unjustly bereaved of his Vine-yard, whereby both Ahab and Jeza∣bel were destroyed: which fearfull example of Gods wrath may well serve at this time to be a looking-glasse for my Ad∣versaries at the Councell-board, who likewise did bend their utmost endevours ujustly to bereave me of my Vine-yard also (that is) of my poore estate, which I disbursed in a ser∣vice, wherein I was imployed by your Majesties Royall Fa∣ther King James, amounting to 5268 l the Service being of no lesse moment then for the preservation of both your Majesties lives, as M. Secretary Morton, by your Majesties

command did certifie your Majesty in writing at Holbery shortly before his death.
Wherefore I doe most humbly pray your Majesty will be graciously pleased to referre this Petition and my grievances hereunto annexed, to be spee∣dily heard before the Assembly sitting in the Commons House in Parliament, that so I may have and receive payment of such moneys, as are due unto mee from your Majesty, together with such satisfaction for my nine yeares wrongfull Imprisonment, Losses and Disgraces, as shall be found agreeable with Justice and Equity.
