SIR,
MY hope is not so nourish'd by ex∣ample, as it will conclude, this dumbe peece should please you, by cause it hath pleas'd others be∣fore: but by trust, that when you haue read it, you will find it wor∣thy to haue dis-pleas'd none. This makes, that I now number you, not onely in the Names of fauour, but the Names of iustice, to what I write; and doe, presently, call you to the exercise of that noblest, and manlyest vertue: as coueting rather to be freed in my fame, by the authority of a Iudge, then the credit of an Vndertaker. Read therefore, I pray you, and censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the simplicity of the first Copy. And, when you shall consider, through the certaine hatred of some, how much a mans innocency may bee indanger'd by an vn-certaine accusation; you will, I doubt not, so beginne to hate the iniquitie of such natures, as I shall loue the contumely done me, whose end was so honora∣ble, as to be wip'd off by your sentence.
