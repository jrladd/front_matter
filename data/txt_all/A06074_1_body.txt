DIVERS there are amongst the variety of men, who though they desire to haue Wealth do not know how to get it. Others there are, who though they know how to get it, haue not either the patience, or will to take the paynes to do it. And other some also there are, who when they haue it either left them by others, or gotten by their owne industry, do not know how to keep it. So that the way vnto Thrift, is not only to get, or to haue Wealth gotten, but also to know how to gouerne & conserue it: not couetously, aboue the stynt of their conuenient need, as diuers
 do; but temperately, proportionatly, and decently: since Thrift ought to be the meane betwixt Liberality and Auarice, like as Liberality is the meane betwixt Auarice and Prodigality; though yet by errour or false interpretation, the one of these is sometimes taken for the other. As the couetous Gamester, by his continuall loosing, either at Dice or Cardes, may be thought to be prodigall though he be not: And on the other side the thriuing Merchant opressed at home with children more then he can well prouide for, may be taken to be couetous when he is not: Since, according to the old Saying, He who hath a daughter to marry, hath need of money; & he likewise who hath two daughters to mar∣ry, hath need of more; but he who hath many daughters to marry, hath need of a great deale. The which to get, some do vse publike violence, and these are commonly depriued therof againe (either they, or theirs) by the speciall prouidence of God: and some others hauing got their wealth with equity and vpright dealing, do prudently conserue and spend it; and these be only they, who may truely be termed Thrifty. Vnto which sort there needeth no more to be said, because they haue the Lawes both of God and Men concurring with them. And therefore vn∣to those other two sorts of Getters before mentioned, this first Booke of the first Volume of my Relation, is only intended, who though they pretend to be followers also of Thrift; yet is it no thriuing to get & conserue their goods, by such culpable meanes, as assuredly resteth punishable, as well by diuine, as by humane Iustice.
Qui nihil sperat, nihil desperat.
