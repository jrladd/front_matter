YOV, who are the Center of my divi∣ded distracted affecti∣ons, in whose re∣tayned favour they meet and are united: the know∣ledg of your devotion unto GOD, and affection unto my selfe, whi∣lest I lived and exercised my Mi∣nistery amongst you, and the ex∣perience thereof in my extremi∣tie, when my paines in Catechi∣zing and Preaching was rewarded
with no little damage to my fun∣ction, state, and person, presses me out of press, to send this little Tractate, with the gratefull ac∣knowledgement of what I owe unto you: For those that know me well, well know, that I owe you more then I am, besides that debt, which though I daily pay can ne∣ver satisfie. Accept this then, I beseech you, such as it is (for un∣to you it is due) with the best interpretation, Sorrow being the Scribe, and Distraction the In∣ventor. I bring you here in a plain dish, not curiously drest, such a service as I well know your soule loveth; which, I suppose, some Dogs will bee snarling or snatch∣ing at, till vengeance, that dogges them at the heels, Iesabel like, de∣vours or excludes them aedibus se∣dibus. Holy things then be whol∣ly
theirs that bee holy: matters divine for persons devout are most fit for use and imployment. I have therefore unto you dedica∣ted this little Catechisme of DA∣VID's because you are loyall, of the feare of GOD, because you are religious. It is little that you may reade it, plain that yours also may understand it. It hath Anti∣quity, and necessity; profit, and pleasure to pleade for it: enter∣taine it then, if you please; it will pleasure you for Confirma∣tion, and yours for Informati∣on: And the LORD multiply upon you both, his best blessings, for CHRIST IESVS his deare Son's sake. AMEN.
