Honoured Sir,
BEING under some Obligation to communicate these following Essays to the World, and being my self sufficiently satisfied with the good meaning and ten∣dency of 'em; I am thereby induc'd in a peculiar manner to recommend 'em to your Perusal ad Acceptance: And in you (I am sure) I at once Honour a Gentility becoming the Po∣litest Age, and a Wisdom that adorn that Antient and much celebrated Family, of which you are now the principal sur∣viving part, and to which I must ever own my self most par∣ticularly oblig'd.

I have here presented you as a tryal of your kind and wonted Constructions with some slight and unaccurate productions of a little leisure; and which at first I designed∣ly form'd in some hurry of thoughts, for my own satisfaction and ease; but have now ventur'd to Publish in times of more Publick and Universal Danger. For tho' I was never much surpriz'd and alarm'd with popular or artificial Fears and Jealousies; (which will perhaps make a noise, even in the most promising Seasons, as long as the World endures) yet when Matter of Fact is notoriously plain and evident; when Tyrannical, Base, and Ʋndermining Principles are seconded with Pow'r, Revenge, and successful Issues; 'Tis a weak piece of bravery merely to defy Danger, and Rank Folly and Stupidity not to be Nationally concern'd.
The Politicks of France are now fairly legible in Speeches and Bravadoes, in Actions and Menaces, and many Self-evident Tokens of a design'd Ʋsurpation: And we are not only to expect the same Burning Effects from the same Dam∣ning Cause; but have also too just and apparent reason to fear, that we shall be graduated up, through all the dectnt forms of Ingenious Cruelty, and the several Stages of Tor∣ture to a more Solemn and Ceremonious Death, if ever Popery lift up it's Head in England.
Perhaps the more dull and half-witted Priests may con∣tent themselves with a short Fiery Tryal; with the Plain and Old-fashion'd way of Sacrificing Hereticks to the Ro∣man Idol: And I have Charity to believe there are many kind and good-natur'd Romanists amongst us, who are so much our Friends, as to shrink and tremble even at the thoughts of such Barbarities as these: But all their good wishes must prove but vain and plausible Nothings, when the Insolent Jesuit has once  Ascendant, and is roaring
up and down with Racks, Wheels, and Damnation in his Mouth, and all the Terrours of the Ten Persecutions: And what will a not swearing, or, who wou'd have thought it, sig∣nify, when our Gates are set open to that Royal Thunderer, who has been so far influenc't by his Beloved Oracles, an the Omnipotent Charms of Canonical Executioners, as to give no rest either to the World or himself; and whose mag∣nified Conduct bears a near resemblance to that Awful sort of Majesty, which Mr. D—n presents us with, in his no∣table Description of a Bull after this manner,
While Monarch-like he rang'd the listed Field,
Some tost, some gor'd, some trampling down he kill'd.
I would here take occasion (had I a Commission so to do) to entertain the Courteous and Benevolent eader with some obliging Prophesie, or comfortable Revelation about Futurities and Events: But at present I must own my self not sufficient∣ly skilled in Astrological Enquiries, Synchronistical Schemes, and other ingenious Whimseys, which sound but immusically to a Judicious Ear, and rather amuze, than improve the Rational Faculties. If I can compose or allay an ill-natur'd Passion, or gratifie a good one, by perusing the Books of Homer, I am not much concern'd with Didymus the Gram∣marian, where he was certainly born; or with others, which were first written, the Iliads or Odysses. So long as I can enjoy the Benefits of the Reformation occasionally be∣gun by Luther; I need not anxiously enquire, what his Name seems to import in the Muscovitish Stile, or High Dutch. And if I could but see my Native Countrey in a Triumphant Condition (of which I do not despair) I care not whether
Albion take it's Name ab Albis Rupibus, from Olbion, or the Son of Neptune.
Be pleased to accept of what I have written, as a Testimo∣ny of my Zeal and Love for Old England, and Honour for your self: I am,
Honoured Sir,
