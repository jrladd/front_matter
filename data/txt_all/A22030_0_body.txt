NEedlesse vvere it for me (right honoura∣ble) to trouble your
learned eares vvith any friuolous dys∣course, concerning the manifolde
vertues contained in this little Booke: because the vvork suffici∣ently 
declares it selfe, & your iudg∣ment exceedeth my simple
demō∣stration. As for the noble man, vvho sometime made account of this
vvorthy Ievvell, and kept it (as hath beene knovvn) vvith no little care,
declaring in his ovvn hono∣rable course of life, the perfect imi∣tation of
so singuler precepts, as he vvas generally reputed a fatherlie freend to
his Countrey, & a bright shining star in his Princes Courte: Let this
christall mirrour, vvherein may be seene the liuely shapes of vertue and
vice (honourable Syr Thomas) bee patronized by you, for noble Fraunces Earle of
Bed∣fordes sake, let this his dailie andhourlie looking
glasse, be the more welcome to you.
Manie are the copies in writing hereof, secretely deliuered
abroade among both noble and other, who for the matter it selfe, and intire
af∣fection to the man while he liued, keepe them as the apple of theyr eye, and
are fearefull to loose such excellent documcnts. Long did I trauaile to
gette a copie of this fa∣mous worke, yet all in vaine, tyll being sent for to
a deere freend of mine, that lay (vnder the fatherlie correction of God) vpō
his death bedde: and for he had nothing of greater esteeme to leaue his
friend (albeit he had the blessing of Godin some measure)
gaue mee thys sweete Booke, wherof I was more glad, than had he giuen mee
vvhat terrestrial affectiō to much coue∣teth.
Beeing possessed of this noble Bedfordes Iewell, vvhose
name I honour vvhile I liue, for many be∣nefits receiued: I coulde not
con∣ceale it to my selfe, but shewing it to diuers my freendes, who dailie
desired copies thereof, as I my self had doone, and finding my selfe
vnable to furnish the desire of so many: as well to satis-fie them, as
other (vvho I know are in like sort affected) I was perswaded to make the
same common by impression,and so haue doone to their no litle
contentment.
And for your honours forvvard zeale to vertue, fauouring all
such as are true professors therof, as also for defence of this Booke
frō wic∣ked detractors: I make as humble present therof to your honor, that
as you are in liuely follower of that vvoorthy Earle and Counseller in life:
so pray I, that your rewarde may be vvith him in the kingdom of Heauen.
