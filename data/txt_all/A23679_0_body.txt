Gentlemen,
THe Presenter of this Epistle is very much the Servant of Col. Ralph Stawel; as any man must needs be, that loves either his Prince or his Countrey, and has the Honour to know that worthy Gentleman. He has likewise the Happiness to be of the acquaintance of the Minister that Preached this ensuing Sermon. Now knowing full well how great a Reverence and Esteem your Worships have for the Honourable Colonel, and this Reverend Divine, this your Supplicant could do no better than recommend the Honourable Colonel, and the Reverend Divine aforesaid, to your Fatherly Care and Protection.
It is most certain that the Generous Colonel has been extremely abused behind his back, by some that he deserved better from, upon occasion of the late Election; and the Divine likewise hath born his part in Reproaches about his late Sermon. I
am not a person to name People, in any case of scandal; and therefore I shall content my self to give your Worships a Hint of what passed lately concerning these Gentlemen, and leave the rest to your Worships Wisdom and Consideration.
It is said for a certain, that in some Company not unknown to your Worships, upon occasion of Discourse with some People of this Neighbour∣hood, there were some very ill words spoken, and ill things done by a Knave, a Fool, and a Cuckold, with relation to the Noble Colonel, and this wor∣thy Divine. If you can either guess at the Men, or if you have heard of the thing, this is hum∣bly to beg of you, that you will interpose your Discretion and Authority in the matter, that it may go no further; and that you will be pleased to keep this to your selves. This comes from a man that must be nameless, and that beseeches you over and over, not to let either the Fool, the Knave, or the Cuckold (if you should happen to stumble upon them) to have any knowledge how This comes to your hand.
The Lord have you in his keeping.
