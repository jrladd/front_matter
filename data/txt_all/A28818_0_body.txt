SInce you have vouchsafed,
from my very infancy, to
shew your benevolence towards
me, and to oblige me to you by
many signal favours; I should
be guilty of gross ingratitude,
if I left not some Monument of
my Respects to You. Permit
me therefore, Renowned Sir, to
wear your Name in the Front
of this small Treatise, which
may produce a larger. I shall
not undertake, according to the

usual mode of Epistolary Ad∣dresses
of this nature, to expa∣tiate
upon your deserved com∣mendation,
which, I am confi∣dent,
is unwelcome to You, and
sufficiently known to all the
World: All I desire is, that the
present and future Age may
testifie, that I am no waies un∣mindful
of the benefits You
have been pleased to confer up∣on
me; and that I shall ever ac∣knowledge
my self to be infi∣nitely
obliged to You:
Farewell.
