My LORD,
THE Dedication of Books to some Wor∣thy Persons, seems to be very natural: For tho' Men of Great Abilities and Fame may appear in the World, without any such Patrons to make Way for their Admittance; yet we that are in a Lower Sphere, stand in need of a Person of Figure and Value, to give some Countenance to such Undertakings.
'Tis to you, My Lord, I therefore make my Application, whose Genius, according to what I have heard, and from that short Conversa∣tion I have had with you, I judge suitable to the Toyl and Greatness of that Province you are called to Preside over. This is a Work I ac∣knowledge, if faithfully Discharged, may, per∣haps, offend and exasperate some; and if not impartially Executed, the God of Heaven will be Displeased, and your own Conscience be Disobliged.

But I come not here so much to be your Monitor, as with this small Present (a Token of my Spiritual Fealty) to bid your Lordship Wel∣come into our Diocess: Where I pray you may do much Good, and enjoy many Good Days; and at last, in God's good time, may be removed to a better place. I am,
My LORD,
