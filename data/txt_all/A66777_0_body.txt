MY Sighs concern you all, throughout this Natiâˆ£on
Who are this day, in true Humiliation
To seek the face of GOD; For, we make One
Of those two Pitchers whom I do bemone:
And, unto whom (then fearing much their breaking,
When first I saw War preparations making)
I sent a Trumpet, both with an Intent
And hope, that which was feared, to prevent;
Which, failing my good purpose to produce,
I send this now, to mediate a Truce;
For, who can tell, but that my words may have
Such ssue now, as heretofore GOD gave
Unto a private-womans when she spoke
For Abel, what effect in season took?
So may it prosper as I am sincere
In that, Which I have Superscribed here;
And, let my Foes on earth, be still as many
As there are men, if I wish ill to any;
Or, am not pleasd that all should live and die
As happy, both in Life and Death as I
Who shall not, by a final Wilfulness,
Deprive themselves of what they might possess;
And slander GOD, as cause Original
Of that, which doth amiss to them befal.
For, though, not few, my Adversaries be
Or such, as, yet, bear no good will to me,

I, ev'n for that cause, am in love, their debter;
For, him, who loves his Foes, GOD, loves the better:
Yea, having partly been, in my distress
Relievd by some few who, do naytheless
Seem still my Enemies; it, makes me more,
Love GOD, and all Mankinde, then heretofore.
A time is come, in which, it is our turn
Both altogether, and apart to mourn:
Those General Calamities befal
Which, for a general Repentance call,
And, for particular Humiliation,
In order to a publick Reformation,
From which, at present, are excepted none;
No, not the King, who sitteth on the Throne:
For, that which is in Cottages begun
Will seize the Pallace, ere the Round is run,
If GOD in mercy, answer not our hope,
And, to our sins and fears, vouchsafe a Stop.
To that end, though this be not what I would
Or, should contribute, it is what I could
And, may now, be as usefully exprest,
As what more artificially is drest:
Yea, (though it be, that onely) in effect,
Which I have ost preferd without respect,
This, seems a very seasonable time,
To greet you, with a Reasonable Rime.
Accept it therefore, and be not offended
With what is conscientiously intended.
GOD, who from us doth Trifles oft receive,
Requires of none, more then he hath to give;
And, if you shall accept what's in my powr
He, will of that accept, which is in your;
For, all that is contributed, by this,
Worth your acceptance, is not mine, but his.
