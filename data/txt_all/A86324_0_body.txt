RIGHT HONOURABLE,
IT is a great Question, whether is the highest and hardest exercise of faith, to flee to God, and rest on him in misery, or to keep close with him, and ascribe all to him in prosperity: Some give the precedency to the last named, because in this we are drawn and bound to God by his own goodnesse; in the other we are thrust upon him by our necessity. Indeed afflictions have a singular usefulnesse in them to acute and en∣large the desires of Saints after God, to render him more sweet and satisfactory to them. Good men are bettered by afflictions: 'Tis hard for the best to keep their spirits so humble, so intent without them, as un∣der them: but tis slavish and hypocriticall to have lit∣tle or no sense, nor care of God, longer then his hand is heavy on the skin, or on the spirit, like those that sel∣dom minde or mention heaven, but on their sick-beds.

It is one great drift of the ensuing Discourse to minde us of our recesse from God, since he hath been returning to us, and to give warning of the possibility, yea, the certainty of great∣er evils to come upon us then ever we felt, if we for∣get God in our prosperity. For your parts (Right Ho∣nourable) as you have had a deep share in the common sufferings, and have shewn forth exemplary forward∣nes in seeking God in times of extremity: so in times of refreshing (if you hold fast your integrity) you shall reap the richest advantage of common successe. That you who are our greater Luminaries may keep your station, and your motion may shine more and more brightly unto the perfect day of our deliverance and salvation, may hold reall weight and worth, accord∣ing to the dignity of your places, that every one of you may be worth thousands, and in the true precedency of honour and grace may out-number your inferiours, to the glory of God, and in despight of suspition and oblo∣quy, is the prayer of
