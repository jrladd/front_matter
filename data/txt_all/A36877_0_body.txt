My Lord,
I Know it is the common errand of all Dedicati∣ons, to beg Protection, but I'le be singular; for the truth is, I might justly be re∣puted very unmannerly, if I should presume to entitle your

Lordship to the Patronage of a controversie, without your con∣sent (though, withal, I dare affirm your Lordship, would not be ashamed to own the Prote∣stant Interest upon any just oc∣casion) All my business is to intreat your Lordship to accept this small Piece, as a Testimony of my real gratitude for your many Favours. And because God hath given me an oppor∣tunity of publishing my thank∣fulness; I must let the world know how great my obligation is, (which I hope I may do, without any offence, either to your Lordship, or the Papists) to which purpose, I suppose, it will be enough to say, that your Lordship never denyed

me your favour, when I begg'd it, and that it hath been freely conferred without the least in∣ducement on my part; which circumstance renders it truely noble, and consequently sute∣able to your Lordships quality. Now to obtain your Lordships acceptance of this poor Pre∣sent, I shall use no other mo∣tive or argument, than to as∣sure your Lordship, that it is tendred with an unfeigned re∣spect and good will; and that though it be but a trifle (its design being only to give your Lordship an hours Divertise∣ment) yet it is all the return I am able to make your Lordship, for the many Talents I owe you. But you know (My

Lord) our Saviour tells us that the poor Widow that cast two Mites into the Treasury, cast in more then all the rich men, because they cast in of their abundance; but she of her pe∣nury, cast in all her Living. And by the same rule, having presented your Lordship with all I have, there was never (for ought I know) so great a a Present made you, as these two Mites, humbly cast into your Lordships Treasury, by (My Lord)
