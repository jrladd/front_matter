SAcred Soueraigne,
in my iniust impri∣sonment in Spayne, it pleased God to af∣flict me with the Ta∣bardilla Pestilence: whereof being in cure, by an especiall Phisition of that King, J obserued his methode for the same, and such other Disea∣ses, as haue perished your Maie∣sties people in the Southerne parts. Which Remedies haue since, by my direction, taken the like good effects.
And of perfect zeale to your Ma∣iesties seruice, and Countries weale, J therewith acquaint your Highnes subiects. Jnuocating God to preserue your Maiestie, enable them in your seruices, protect your King∣doms, and suppresse your Enemies.
