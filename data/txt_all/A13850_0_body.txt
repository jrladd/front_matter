Worthy Sir,
IF any should aske mee (as mine own thoughts doe) vpon what confidence J adventure in this Censuring Age, the Publishing of this poore ensu∣ing discourse; I would then answere
 them (as now I doe my selfe) that, when I review and consider the Nakednesse thereof, I cannot va∣lue it worthy of the Title of such a Mite, as deseruedly might, when cast into the Treasury, finde accep∣tance. Nor is it my care and de∣sire to please the Humours of those, who can, with sweet con∣tent, spend that time in Censuring of other mens endeavours, which they might with as good Honesty imploy in the Bettering of their owne. There is a Carpere vel no∣li nostra vel ede tua, which I leaue to their Graue considerati∣ons, vntill such time, as after some long-expected Parturiunt mon∣tes, the world happily finde as good cause to laugh at their folly,
 as they at other mens good intenti∣ons. Never was J yet taught ei∣ther to flatter, or (without offence given) to feare Mortality, much lesse to make a Time-seruing Disposition the least part of my happinesse; and therefore if any shall thinke it fit to vilify these my weake endeavours, (that there may betweene vs be no loue lost) I shall care as little for their cen∣sure, as they doe, or can, for this my labour. Tis your deserving Goodnesse, and that in particu∣lar towards my selfe, which hath (I may truly say) enforced me thus farre to appeare vnto the world; and therein to expresse that I am ready (though not able) to recom∣pence that kinde loue, which by me
 hath beene receiued from you: The beginning whereof I then happily enjoyed, whiles it pleased your good Father, my much Honoured Friend, to commit you vnto my Charge and tuition; in which time, as my small Labours were abun∣dantly rewarded by a full Hand, so were my true desires towards You further encouraged by many pregnant Testimonies of your good and louing disposition, which, since that time, hath fully appeared in many reall expressions. Beside, o∣thers will confesse too that your de∣seruing goodnesse hath beene fur∣ther spread in a willing readinesse towards this your Colledge; Ho∣nouring most worthily the religi∣ous and flourishing estate thereof
 (which stands yet (blessed be the Highest) vnquestionable) and still thankefully acknowledging their loue towards you, whose care hath beene imployed in the gover∣ment of the same. So that most here haue some cause, but my selfe most of all, to honour (at the least in a true desire) the good Deserts of so worthy a friend. For this cause desiring to devote vnto you some part of my weake and slender labours in testimony of my thanke∣fullnesse, I haue at the last adven∣tured on this small Parcell; the sub∣iect whereof will, I know content you well, as being that, which your selfe with your vertuous Lady in the goverment of your family, as good stewards, daily
 practise; only my vnworthy moul∣ding of so good à Matter, might iustly expect to fall short of Accep∣tation, but that I am well assured of your Goodnesse therein too. If any shall, for your sake, be plea∣sed to afford hereto à favourable Aspect, I shall thankefully ac∣knowledge them my Courteous Readers; and to him, that is not purposely Curious, some small re∣quiting Benefit may happily ac∣crew. Each man, if not wilfully blinde, may see how that All things hy Gods disposing Provi∣dence become daily new to him, and that tis therefore necessary, he should in Heart and Soule bee Such to God. However, J am fully assured of Your Readinesse in
 embracing a seasonable Memen∣to tending vnto this purpose; E∣specially seeing that as all men haue some cause thankefully to con∣fesse the Renewing of all things vnto them; so You much more: Considering that, besides the abun∣dant sufficiency of worldly rich∣es by the Providence of your Hea∣venly directed Father still flow∣ing towards you, God hath so quickly invested you with New Dignities of Honour and Ser∣vice (Knighthood and Iustice∣ship) imploying you farther in a new charge, the Guidance of a great Family, of which you are made the Head; and (which is the Complement of your other feli∣licities) hath seasonably blest you
 with an hopefull Sonne; à Sonne borne to you by a sweetly dispo∣sed Lady, who is, both of your Happinesse a ioyfull Partaker, & also a true Consort in your loue to Gods words. So that nothing remaines now, but that you con∣tinue to endeavour (as you haue begunne) the Renewing of your Heart in Thankefulnesse vnto that God, who hath so plentifully crowned you with those New blessings. And, that you may thus labour continually to make a sanctified vse thereof, for the en∣creasing of them vnto your selfe, (which otherwise cannot be look'd for) and also the setting forth of Gods glory (who bestowed them on you) you haue for Gods dire∣cting
 of your heart, the daily prayers of him, who desires to bee and remaine ever
