IF Custome did not force a Complement of Dedication; yet this Book would desire to insinuate into the affection of Ladies, and Gentlewomen; since it can arrive at no greater perfection of happiness than your favour, which is most earnestly desired. And in requitall of this your favour, it shall be alwaies rea∣dy to furnish you with the best expressions of choice and omplementall language; for though by nature and custome ou ca deliver your mindes in a smooth and gracefull man∣er; yet from hence, without study, or premeditation, you may command necessary ceremonies. Let therefore this one nstance, in stead of more which might be inserted, perswade our intelligible generous dispositions, to receive this Book ow exactly perfected, as your devoted Servant, and to ho∣our it with your favour, which I shall esteem as an exl∣ation to the supremest sublunary felicite, and the ightes errestiall happiness.
