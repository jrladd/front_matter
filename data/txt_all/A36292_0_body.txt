My Lord,
ALthough I have not exactly obey∣ed your com∣mands, yet, I hope, I have exceeded them, by presen∣ting to your Honor, this Trea∣tise,

which is, so much the better, by being none of mine owne, and may therefore peradventure, de∣serve to live, for facilitating the Issues of Death.
It was writ long since, by my Father, and by him, forbid both the Presse, and the Fire; nei∣ther had I subjected it now, to the publique view, but that, I could finde no certaine way to defend it from the one, but by committing it to the other; For, since the beginning of this War, my Study having been often sear∣ched, all my Books (and al-most my braines, by their continuall allarums) sequestred, for the use of the Committee; two dangers

appeared more eminently to ho∣ver over this, being then a Ma∣nuscript; a danger of being ut∣terly lost, and a danger of being utterly found; and fathered, by some of those wild Atheists, who, as if they came into the World by conquest, owne all other mens Wits, and are resolved to be learned, in despite of their Starres, that would fairely have enclined them, to a more modest, and honest course of life.
Your Lordships Protection will defend this Innocent from these-two Monsters, Men that cannot write, and Men that can∣not reade, and, I am very confi dent, all those that can, will think

it may deserve this favour from your Lordship; For, although this Booke appeare under the no∣tion of a Paradox, yet, I desire your Lordship, to looke upon this Doctrine, as a firme and established truth,Da vida osar morir.

From my house in Covnt-Garden. 2.
