Right Worshipfull,
HAVING this small Treatise lying dead by me, or at least asleep; and be∣ing provoked to give it more roome and some breath, that
it might be awakened by the Presse and Printers hand to come to light; I could not be∣thinke my selfe to make De∣dication of it (as the use is) to any one more fitly then your selfe, and that for these reasons: First, you have been a good Disciple in the schoole of Piety from your very non-age, and education by that pi∣ous Lady your ancient Mo∣ther (whom I much honour) with the rest of that vertu∣ous brood, some of whom it was my lot to seale up in their sepulchres, besides some of your owne. Secondly, you have been a constant hearer of these and other my Colla∣tions
when you have been in these parts. Thirdly, you are my loving Patrone, by whose meanes and instigation, ac∣cording to the desire of the Congregation, I was (some yeares since) brought to this place. Fourthly, I therefore am peculiarly ingaged unto you, and love not to live or dye wholly in debt, (I look to lay downe my tabernacle daily) accept, I pray, this small Testimony of Grati∣tude: I must say as Peter, Act. 3.6. Silver and gold have I not, but such as I have give I you, a little plaine fruit of my owne grafting, I therefore dedi∣cate
it unto your selfe, and by you to my well-affected friends, my constant, conscio∣nable, and profitable hea∣rers: (Never more need of Faith and living by it, then in this terrible tempest) the blessing of the Lord goe with it.
