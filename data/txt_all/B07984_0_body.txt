MAister Baw-waw, as one vnknowne, yet mooued through affection, as also hearing of your arriuall into England, I haue made bolde to dedicate this my simple labor vnto you; to be shrowded, sheilded, and defended by your indifferent censure, you beeing a Spirit all compoz'de of mirth and merrie conceite: And although it may seeme but a toy, yet be∣ing read, may refrigerate your senses tossed and weeried with the tedious trauell of for∣raine Countries, as also stirre vp a hart plun∣ged in melancholie, and adde alacritie to a minde disposed to mirth. Thus, not kno∣wing how I may well commend it, I referre it (as before) by you to be censured.
