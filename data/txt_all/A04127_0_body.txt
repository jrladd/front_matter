WHereas euery one is made, not onely for himselfe, but for the Common-wealth; which in a Monarchy (such as ours) consisteth in the welfare of the KING: the welfare of the KING con∣sisteth in the loyall and louing hearts of his sub∣iects: their loue and loyalty may most appeare in taking or approuing of the Oath of Allegeance: I thought it also my duty (most reuerend in Christ, and my very good Lord) being a publicke Mi∣nister, by a publicke authority commanded, to gather and declare the proofes thereof out of the word of God. The cause is publicke both for this, and for all kingdomes, the place where it was vttered was publicke, being a Synode of the Clergie. The fruit may be publick in satisfy∣ing the doubtfull, which here may see; that this concerneth not so much the Popes, as Gods au∣thority bestowed vpon our King: our aduersaries
are growne publick in their libels & contradictions; & therfore this without ambition or vainglory may be publisht to the world. Thus determining to come in publick, the fauors I haue receiued of your Grace, who both cōmanded me to preach on this theame, & then encouraged me to print this my Sermon, makes me the more presume to dedicate it vnto your graci∣ous patronage & protection: for although the matter doth not answere your iudicious expectation (as a mean artificer often mars good stuffe with rude hād∣ling) but that the truth wil well enough defend it selfe with a bad weapon: yet the matter cannot be but ac∣ceptable vnto your most religious loyal Care, which with deare and deepe affection (I know) desires & en∣deauors by doctrine, discipline & example, the confu∣sion of Antichrist, the peace of Sion, the safegard and honor of our blessed Soueraigne. Whatsoeuer it is, it is the profession of a cleare conscience; which if I haue not wel exprest, there are far stronger, which vphold the state of this question; & many may succeed in this defence. There is no true Christian-subiect, but wold aduêture credit & life in so great & good a cause: And therfore humbly beseeching your Grace fauorably to censure the first aduentures of a young scholler. I most humbly beseech the God of Grace, to multiply his graces on your head and hart, vnto your honor in this, and happines in a better world. And so rest.
