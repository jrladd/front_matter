Right Honourable,
WHEN this Labour lay obstructed by the injuri∣ousness of others, and partly by my own inability, a word of your Lordship, in favour of this Work, did instantly excite the Right Wor∣shipfull, the Mayor and Aldermen of Leicester, and soon after some Honourable Personages and Wor∣thy Gentlemen of our Town and County to promote the Printing of this Book of Hymns: and had not fraud and injury inevitably pre∣vented, I had e're this presented this little Volume into your Honou∣rable

Hands in humble Gratulation of your Lordship's Favours: ho∣ping also to leave it as a lasting monument of your attested Piety and the Liberality of the Benefac∣tors ad of your Honourable Pro∣tection of,
My LORD,
