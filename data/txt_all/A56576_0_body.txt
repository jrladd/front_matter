Right Honourable,
THE Day of BRITAIN'S solemnities, for the Happy Returne and Restauration of our Most Gracious and Illustrious KING, safe in His Person and sound in the truth of Religion (after such a long and dis∣mall Absence) to His Ancient Dominions, and to His native Royalties and Government, is such an transcendent temporall Mercy, as deserves to be writen, not only on Pillars of Marble, and with a Diamond and Pen of Iron, but upon the Spirits of all, who are truely Godly and Loyall within BRITAINE and Ireland. And it cannot be expected, but such an great & merci∣full Revolution, brought about in such an unanimous, peaceable, sweet way, without bloud, will be exceedingly magnified and cal∣led Blessed, by all succeeding Generations, so long as SCOT∣LAND ENGLAND and Ireland remains to be NATIONS.

And who are so stupid? but must look upon this, at an signall token for good, that after such an great State-quake, and Over∣turning in these three KINGDOMS, when all concernments in them were wrap'd up in Darknesse and Confusion, when mens thoughts were quivering, like the needle in the Sea compasse and knew not where to rest, The LORD should have been plea∣sed, even then, in such a sudden, to concenter the hearts and de∣sires of these three NATIONS, in the KINGS MAIESTY, his Person and Government, as the only earthly Foundation of their Prosperity and Peace. This admirable Mercy, hath brought forth many loud and Publique Acclamations of joy in all Cities, Counties, Incorporations and Churches of the three LANDS, and indeed Duty to GOD ALMIGHTY, who hath made his own Ame bare in our Deliverance, Duty to Our SO∣VERAIGNE the KING, GOD His immediat Vice-gerent over us, the Duty which wee owe to Our Consciences, Rela∣tions and Interests, and to the Protestant Religion at home & abroad, cals for very singular appearances, and resentments of such an eminent Blessing.
Amongst many other His MAIESTIES Royall Burghs in SCOTLAND, I beleeve none (be it spoken without envy or dis∣paragement) did appeare more early, and with greater alacrity and cheerfulnesse in the publique and solemne manifestations of their Joy, for His MAJESTIES safe and happy Returne and Restauration to His just Government, nor this City did, which hath alwayes accounted its Fidelity and Loyalty to its native KING, its chiefe earthly Ornament; whereof it hath many testimonies and evidences standing in publique Register, and during His MAIESTY'S sad dayes, & absence, none loved His MAIESTY more, none Prayed more heartily, none longed more earnestly, nor ABERDENE did, for that blessed day of His MAIESTIES Returne and Restauration, which the right hand of the LORD hath at last brought to Passe: Beside many other very Solemne and Publique Manifestations of the joy of this CITY, for this Mercy, never to be forgotten, it was your HONOURS command, that the following Sermon, being prea∣ched

in your Pulpit at your desyre, should be put to the Presse, & although the Conscience of my own weaknesse, and the worthles∣nesse of any thing, which can drop from my Mouth or Pen, might and would have put mee, from any appearance in Print, Yet the subject being so Royall, and at such a nick of time, and my res∣pects to your HONOURS being so many and so pressing, have prevailed with mee to let this poor Mite of yours and my own Loyalty, appeare on the Stage of a Criticke World, Veritas non querit angulca: I know I must meet with Censurers, but if men will censure Truth harshly, it will stand upon its own joints, and if they censure my meane conceptions, and expressions, I can suffer that easily, for it is the matter and not the manner, that I have chiefly aimed at, which makes this paper come out, in its naked Simplicity, without Ornaments. Whatever it is, I have put it under your Patrociny, and I lay it down at your feet as a small testimony of my many Obligations and Ingage∣ments to your HONOURS and to this Honourable City. The LORD multiply His Spirit and Grace upon you, that you may go on, to act for the Glory of GOD, for the Power of GODLYNES, for the KINGS MAJESTY'S happinesse, and for the Good and Prosperity of this People. So Prayeth
