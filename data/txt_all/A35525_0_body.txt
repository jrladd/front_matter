Madam,
I Should not offer Your
Royal Highness a Pre∣sent
of so little value, had
I not this to encourage
me; that 'tis not the Gift it

self; but the Way of giving,
which finds Acceptance with
Great, and Generous Minds.
And in this (as in other things)
they resemble the Divinity;
that looks with a more favou∣rable
Eye upon Sincerity, and
Truth (tho' in the plainest
Dress) than upon all the Pomp,
and Splendour of a Costly
Worship.
It is not as a Poet, Madam,
that I address my self to Your
Royal Highness. For I pre∣tend
to no Exactness in an Art,
which I never profess'd. The
Course of Life, which I have
form'd to my Self, lies quite
in another Road; and I have
never convers'd with the Mu∣ses,

but in some dead Intervals
of Time; when I have had no
Company but my own self, and
no Business but to think.
So that, when I throw
these Papers at Your Royal
Highnesses Feet, it is not that
I think they deserve that Ho∣nour;
but as an humble ex∣pression
of Duty; which I am
more particularly oblig'd to
pay; because I have been so
happy as to pass some Time in
Your Royal Highnesses Court;
and to be a Witness of those
Things, which have enter'd
Your Character in the Books
of Fame; and rais'd it to so
high a Pitch, that it strikes
Your Enemies with Silence,

Your Friends with Joy, and
all the World with Admirati∣on.
I know, Madam, to flatter
Greatness is a Disease common
in Courts; and those few who
escape it, because they con∣verse
with an infected Multi∣tude,
are seldom look'd upon
as sound; but I am sure, I was
never guilty of that Weakness.
And indeed, not to mention
the real Injustice, as well as the
numerous ill Consequen∣ces,
that attend it; there is
something in the very Na∣ture
of Flattery too mean,
and little for an Honest Mind
to stoop to.

But, at the same time that I
abhor Flattery, I love Justice;
and in all, that I say to Your
Royal Highness, upon this
Occasion, every body is obli∣ged
to declare (or with Silence
give their Consent) that I only
give Honour to whom Ho∣nour
is due.
It is certain, that very few are
fit to hear their own Elogies;
for where there is the least In∣clination
to Pride, or Vanity, it
turns their Heads, and expo∣ses
'em to a fall. But a Mind
elevated above all that is
Light, or Trivial; when it
looks upon the Shadow of its
own Greatness, is excited with
a generous Heat, and presses

forwards in the Race of Glo∣ry.
And therefore I will pre∣sume
to shew your Royal
Highness, what Streams of
Blessings are flowing upon
you, by the Influence of Hea∣ven,
thro' the Channels of Na∣ture,
and Fortune.
Tho', Madam, You have
the Happiness to be lineally
descended from an Ancient
Race of Kings; and joyn'd
to a growing Hero, whose
Courage and Conduct (like
the Light) are best known by
themselves; and can never
have so good an Elogy, as his
own Actions; yet Providence
has taken such particular Care

in forming You; that You
have fewer Equals in Personal
Advantages, than in Birth,
and State.
I could enlarge upon this in
as many Particulars, as there
are Ways of being distin∣guish'd
from the rest of the
World. And in every one of
these Heav'n has some Design.
The various Gifts of Nature
are not dispens'd in vain.
Beauty, and Gracefulness are
no small Advantages to Great
Persons; giving a certain
Force to all their Words, and
Actions, which is hardly to be
resisted; and perswading us,
with a silent Eloquence, into
an awful Veneration of their

Excellencies, and an Imitation
of their Vertues. At the same
time, a quick, and right Ap∣prehension
of Things; a clear
and solid Judgment; with a
Natural Tendency to all that
is Just, and Good, and Chari∣table;
are such inestimable
Blessings in a high Station;
that You are more beholding
to God for being so qualified,
than for being born a Princess.
When I add to all this, that
Your Soul is touch'd with a
Spark of that Fire, which
warms the Hearts of Angels,
and kindles Mortality into De∣sires
that are Immortal; it gives
such a double Lustre to all the
rest of Your Accomplish∣ments;

and invests You with
something so Glorious, and
Divine; that we can never have
Eyes enough to Admire You,
or Tongues enough to praise
You.
But the Greatness of my
Subject carries me beyond my
Self; and I am lost in a Mul∣titude
of Thoughts too migh∣ty
to be utter'd. I Shall there∣fore
leave to a Historian what
is so much above my Talent,
and Business at this Time.
Those, who are rash enough,
to sully any part of this Cha∣racter,
will certainly betray a
great deal of Weakness, or
Malice; and the Injuries, which
they invent, will fall at last

upon their own Heads. Ju∣stice,
and Truth are the par∣ticular
Care of Heaven. They
surmount every thing; and
their Lustre breaks through
the thickest Clouds. When
any Subtilty, or Force of Ar∣gument
can perswade Men to
believe, that the Sun does not
Shine; or that the Stars are not
bright; then (and not till then)
shall the Glory of an Illu∣strious
Life be stifled, and
obscur'd.
As for this Little Present,
Madam; which I presume to
offer Your Royal Highness;
'tis compos'd of some Things,
which have been writ at seve∣ral
Times, and upon several

Occasions; and, as they have
been thrown aside among o∣ther
things of the same Nature
(which I forbear to Print, be∣cause
I have not had time to
look 'em over) so they are
most of 'em very rough, and
imperfect. But, at the same
time, I cannot doubt of Your
Royal Highnesses Protection,
to any thing, that is Writ in
Defence of Truth, and Vir∣tue;
at a time, when they are
almost driven out of the
World. And That has been
the chief Design of most of
these Papers. I have aim'd at
the truest Images of Nature,
the fairest Pictures of Virtue,
and the purest Ideas of Divini∣ty.

I have endeavour'd to
represent the Passion of
Love, not as a great many
modern Hands have drawn
it, but (as it ought to be) in
its own native Beauty, and In∣nocence.
I ask Your Royal Highness
Pardon, for the Liberty, I
have taken. I wish You eve∣ry
Thing, that may contri∣bute
to make You entirely
happy. And, as this little
Present has been only the Em∣ployment
of some Idle Hours:
so if it had been the Busi∣ness
of all my Life; I should
think my self more than dou∣bly
paid; in having an op∣portunity
of declaring to

the World; that I am (with
an inviolable Zeal, and Sin∣cerity)
Madam,
