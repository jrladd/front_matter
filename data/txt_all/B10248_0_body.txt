My Lord;
THe Belgick Pro∣vinces for the last Century have been such a Thea∣tre of Mars, that all the Princes of Europe have little reason to thank the Spa∣niard
 for enforcing the States of Holland to know and use their own power and strength; and therefore it was gravely expressed by a sober Person, that to have all the Low Coun∣tries governed by a few States, or by one Prince, wholly de∣pending upon the King of Spain, would be equally dan∣gerous: but it doth most com∣port with the interest of Eng∣land, in Wisdom and Policy, to erect and establish such a Prince as should neither alto∣gether depend upon France, or be wholly devoted unto Spain; or else to divide the Seventeen Provinces into di∣vers
 several Cantons, whereby some of them being induced to affect England, and others to favour Princes of their Re∣ligion, they could not render themselves so formidable.
How prudent an expedient this would be for the security of England, and to establish peace in Christendom, I submit it unto your Lordships grave judgement, who is perfectly acquainted with all the Criti∣cismes of State. But that which is the just admiration of all wise men, the lesser moie∣ty of these Provinces hath far exceeded even the whole, and seven Provinces are become
 greater and more potent then Seventeen: In Riches and Power they have out-done some of the greatest Princes in Europe. Their Cities are many and splendid; and yet there are more Sects among them then Cities, and as ma∣ny Creeds as Heads: but if they had imitated your Lord∣ship when you did them the honour to live amongst them, (the regularity of your De∣votions being with such re∣verence) you had made all their Provinces Canonical: yet they have learned to vernish their lucre with De∣votion, and to make godli∣ness
 a Page to their pri∣vate Interest, and to be so wise in any of their meet∣ings never to discourse of Religion; their Opinions therein, being as opposite as the sides of the Diameter; but they all concentre in this one Ecliptick line, to darken the Authority of Princes.
Your Lordship (being so great an Artizan of State) understands all their Arca∣na and Mysteries; and so great a Captain, as (this AGE with much difficulty hath not produced a greater) you know all their Policies and
 Stratagems of War; by the first your Lordship hath much en∣gaged your own Nation; by the other, you may live to oblige all Nations of the World. I do beg your Lord∣ships pardon for this interru∣ption, leaving the Grandeur of your Actions, and the Glory of your Name, to be blazon'd by the Heralds of Time, and celebrated in the lasting Chro∣nicles of after-Ages.
