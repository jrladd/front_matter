MADAM,
THis Sermon which I make bold to present to your Highness, bears upon its Front, THE ROYAL JOY, a Title given unto it by the Text; but we bear another upon the front of our hearts, viz. THE POPƲLAR JOY. The Kings Joy bath been made the Subject of the Publick Joy: It hath chiefly appear∣ed upon the Countenances of all your faith∣ful Subjects of the Town of Breda, in an
extraordinary manner, there being none of our Inhabitants but hath given the marks of a cordial Applause, upon the first report of His Majesties Restaurati∣on, with an excess of joy, and I dare say, with as strong expressions of rejoycing, as might have been uttered by the most affe∣ctionate of his own Subjects. And I may truly say, Madam, that it is not the pre∣sent time of prosperity, which hath given us the first impressions of this inclination towards that worthy Prince; it is of an older date, and had its beginning together with the knowledge we had of him: We never saw him coming in, or going out of this Town, during the time of his Afflicti∣on, but we made Vows for his Deliver∣ance; yea, and we would have carried him upon his own Throne, had our strength been equal to the motions of our hearts, and could the effects have been answerable to
the tenderness of our affection, which hath had a not able increase, since the time Hea∣ven hath favored us with the accomplish∣ment of our desires, and hath chosen this Town to be the place where His Majesty hath received the news of his Proclama∣tion, where his Subjects have resorted in crowd to render him their Devoirs, and where even our Soveraign Magistrates the Lords States General and Provinci∣al of Holland, have personally appeared to express unto His Majesty the sense of the singular satisfaction they received by seeing such an happy day.
It is true, Madam, your Highness hath been the occasion our Town hath received such an Honor, and therefore we do ac∣knowledge you as the second cause of it, and the Instrument in the hand of God; yet we do interpret it as a benefit of God, whereby he hath been pleased to reward the
part we have taken, out of our affections, in the calamities of that Prince; that as for a long time we have sympathiz'd with him, so we should be the first sharers of his com∣fort and joy. I cannot think, Madam, that any one would be so unjust towards us, as to envy us such an advantage, since it is justified even by the example of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was pleased that Mary Magdalene (to whom the Town of Breda may be compared upon the pre∣sent occasion) should have the first share of the glad tidings of his Resurrection, which she received from his own mouth, as a reward of her cares and fears for him, wherein she had excelled above all his o∣ther friends and kindred. The Custom of our Ancestors, who rendred their memo∣rable actions, even the days of their Fu∣nest Battels, famous by the names of the places wherein they had hapned, doth give
that right to our Town, that this so re∣markable action of the Divine Providence, which is one of the most signal wonders that ever were celebrated by the Histories of the past ages, ought to be published under its name: Blessed be therefore that august day, wherein His Majesty being in the midst of us, hath received by an unani∣mous accord, the Homage of his Subjects. Let it henceforth be called, THE DAY OF BREDA: Let it be, under that Name, the Object of the Admiration of all the Christian Kings and Princes; let it shine even to the most remote places of the Barbarous Nations; let it be ingraved with the Steel in our Records and Memo∣rials, that for ever it may be the subject of the Discourses of our Posterity.
But that which we do esteem above all, Madam, is the admirable goodness and sweetness, wherewith His Majesty hath
received the visits of all sorts of persons: Those affectionate and reiterated protesta∣tions and promises be hath made to our Soveraign Lords the States, as also to our vener able Magistrates, to the Pastors, and to the other persons, both Political and Ecclesiastical, of this Town; Of the sincerity of his affection towards the true Reformed religion, and towards all the Protestant Princes and States, and chiefly towards the States of these Uni∣ted Provinces; promising unto them the continuation of the affection his Ancestors have shewed unto them; and particularly, Of the favorable remem∣brance and good will he would still keep for the Town of Breda, where he had received the news of his restaura∣tion, and known the effects of the incli∣nation shewed to his Person and to his Subjects. That language, Madam, hath
ravished our spirits, hath filled our hearts with joy, and our mouths with vows and acclamations. We have gathered it with our own ears, as the expressions which the Spirit of Peace had dictated to His Ma∣iesty's mouth, which will make us hereafter cast our eyes upon that Excellent Prince, as upon a mighty Organ reserved by God for the present times, and raised, in his blessing, to be a ballance and an Equili∣brium for the publick tranquillity through∣out all Europe.
And our Inhabitants, Madam, have also expressed a singular satisfaction of the gracious content his Majesty hath been pleased to shew be hath received of their cordial affection and weak services they have been able to render to those that be∣long to your Royal House. And we pray your Highness to believe, that if the noise of our Muskets and Canons thundering
from our Bulwarks, at the departure of his Maiesty, could not accompany him further then a little beyond our gates; that of our Vows and prayers to God for his prosperity, will follow him to his very City of London, and will contribute to the setting of his Crowns upon his head. These are the truest proofs of our affecti∣on, which your Highness doth ever recom∣mend unto us, as often as we have the honor to wait upon you, viz. those of our pray∣ers to God for your Highness and your Family. And truly, they are the most material and the most pure ones, and which give stronger impressions then all others; for they do ascend to the place of origine, viz. Heaven, and bring down from thence abundance of blessings upon earth; where∣as all others do vanish in their pomp and apparate, and most part cannot bring any advantage to the object thereof. Which
consideration hath put me in mind of the matter of this Sermon pronounced upon the same day we prepared to take our leave of his Majesty, and conceived our publick vows for the prosperity and the happy suc∣cess of his Voyage. Now our Flock de∣siring of me some copies of it, to keep an eternal memory in their families of such an illustrious Occurrence, I made bold, Madam, most humbly to crave the pro∣tection of your Highness, under whose sweet & favor able Government 'tis main∣tained; being besides doubly interessed in the subject which gave occasion to this Ser∣mon, both in regard of themselves, and in regard of his Highness the Prince of Orange, which is the object of our delight, and upon whose face the Royal lustre of his Maiesty doth also shine. And al∣though this small work be not answer able to its illustrious subject, yet your Highness's
goodness, whereof we have an infinite number of proofs, doth assure me you will cast a gracious eye upon the Author's in∣tention, and out of your clemency will bear with his defects. In the confidence where of, I do continue my vows to the Soveraign King of Kings, that be may be pleased to poure his most precious graces upon your Highness, and all your Serenissime Fa∣mily, and to conserve their Lustre upon Earth, and make them Triumphant in Heaven: Having no other ambition but to express, with all the imaginable respects, how much I am,

From BREDA, May 24. 1660.
