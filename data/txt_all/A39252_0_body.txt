Right Worshipfull,
YOu who have beene so long a time sha∣rers both in the same great
Vertues, and, for them, in the same great Suffe∣rings: be
pleased too, to share in this small tribute, for which I 
have been long indebted to your Goodnesse. Your Names, I con∣fesse,
are either of them too great to stand in the front of so incon∣siderable a
paper as this, where∣with I here present you; and might make a suitable
Fronti∣spice to some farre more excel∣lent Tract. Whatever this be,
which begs your Candid accep∣tance, it may perhaps need, but I fear it
deserves not, I am sure it does not now come abroad to seek a
Patron. The reason why I addresse it to you, is an Ambition I have, to
bring the world better acquainted with so great a part of it's own
Treasure: & to make it know, there be yet (after all 
these dreining times) some such Worthy Persons as your
selves; whom even they, who are (to a Christian Stoicisme)
enemies to the present VVorld, dare both love &
honour. Were it my businesse to seek out an Instance of the
Genu∣ine, or a Patterne whereby to cor∣rect the
Spurious and degenerate Gentleman, I should despaire to fit my selfe
better, then I may in You: in whom after so many kil∣ling
Afflictions the World may yet behold a true Religion and
Loyalty surviving your Fortunes. I might well fear, should
the Reader know you as well as I, his expectation by
the view of your praefixed Names, would be  raised too
much above the Con∣tents of the following Letter; and
therefore I shall, no lesse out of Charity to mine own
Infirmi∣ties, then from a due Reverence to that knowne
Modesty which Crowns your many other No∣ted Vertues, forbear
any further to display your Merits: only this I would have the World
to know, and do beg you to believe, that I shall ever be industrious to
ma∣nifest my selfe

Right Worshipfull
