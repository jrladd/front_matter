MOst Illustrious Princes, this short tractate, though far unworthy your sight, much less your Princely Patronage, yet is humbly dedicated to your gracious, and Royall hands, and submitted to your most judi∣cious censure; first considering your excel∣lent goodness, by which you can (with your favour) make that which is of no worth, valuable upon the score of your Princely
acceptance: secondly because it is humbly presented to the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, of the first of which, you are incomparable members; lastly considering the subject it treats of, and the intended scope of it, on which score, I hope it may meet with a kind ac∣ceptance from your true filiall Piety and Princely wisdom: Pardon most royall Heroes, this bold presumption of him, who wants deserts, yet presuming on your gracious pardon, hath the boldness, (may it not be interpreted impudence) to sub∣scribe himself,
High and Mighty Princes,

St. Thomas Apostles
