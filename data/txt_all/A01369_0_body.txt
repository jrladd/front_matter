GOod cosen, not any desert of mine owne woorth,
but hoping to be countenanced by your woor∣thines,
maketh me thus bould to relye on your accep∣tance
of this idle woorke, compounded (as the French
nod) of sundry fashions, a thing (which if it proue plea∣sing
to you in the least respect) I shall thinke it valua∣ble
to my cost and labour: I doe not doubt but as al∣wayes
you haue looued me, so you will not now re∣iect
this instance of my zealous affection which I haue
had from my cradle to gratifie you, protesting (if you
wil boulster me in this) neuer to step so farre into the
presse agayne, and thus withall respectiue ceremonies
I take my leaue.
