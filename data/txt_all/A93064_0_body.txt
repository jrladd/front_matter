Most Gracious Prince,
THat I so mean and unworthy a Subject, (yet a Cordial wel∣wisher to your Royall Majesty,

and who is one, among many thou∣sands of your faithfull Subjects, who dayly pray for, and constantly hope, and expect to see your restitution) should address my self thus to Ma∣jesty, I neither know well to a∣pologize for, nor yet to omit. It is not, most Illustrious Soveraign, that I either account my self a compe∣tent Champion, to mannage your most just, and Princely quarrell, nor yet that I think your cause (in it self considered) to need any defense, much lesse so weak as mine; (for whom God protects, he certainly needs none of mans Patronage) nor that I account the Authors scurrilous impertinencies (so far as immediately they concern your Sacred Majesty) worth the Answer, nor is it an itch

or ambition of appearing in publi∣que, that hath ivited me to this Reply, least of all, is it any esteem of, or conceit of worth in my self, that could make me presume to pre∣sent this inconsiderable mite of my Service to your Princely view, or that I should dare to imagine your Majesties present Afflictions, so to concerne your esteem and Royall worth, as that any of your Sub∣jects might presume more now up∣on these exercising Tryalls of God upon your Majesty, then if you were seated upon your Hereditarily due, and justly deserved Throne, in magnificent Splendor. God forbid that my Breast should Har∣bour such an unbecomming thought to Majesty, yours especially, which

by your Afflictions, hath beene really made, and apparently is seen more glorious, as Gold by the fire is purified, or a pretious Dia∣mond upon the wheele is polished, and made sparklingly resplendent. Since then, Royall Sir, It hath beene none of the mentioned Con∣siderations, give me leave with your Pardon to shew your Ma∣jesty the true Cause, First of this undertaking, and next of this bold∣nesse of Addresse, in it self a Pre∣sumption not to be pleaded for, but only through your Princely goodnesse pardonable. How your Majesties Royall Father was dealt with all is Englands ignomi∣ny, your Subjects infamy, Reli∣gions Scandall, and the wonder,

amazement, and astonishment of Europe, and the Actors eternall reproach among all Naions, the Abettors Confusion, the punishment of all our sins, and the inlet of a floud of miseries upon us ever since. This detestable, execrable Mur∣ther, committed by the worst of Parricides, accompanyed, with the diselaiming of your whole Roy∣all stock, dishinheriting your Ma∣jesties self, and the rest of the Royall Branches, driving you and them into Exile, with indeavou∣ring to expunge, and obliterate, your never to be forgotten just Ti∣tle, tearing up, and pulling down the Pillars of Majesty, the No∣bles; garbling, and suspending from place of Power, all of the

Commons House, that had any thing of Honesty, or relenting of spirit toward the injur'd Father of three Nations, and his Royall Posterity, Acts horrible to be imagined, and yet with high hand most Villanously, Perfideously, and Perjuriously, prepetrated, by Monsters of mankind, yet blas∣phemously dishonourers of God, in making use of his name, and u∣surping the Title of Saints, in these never before parallel'd, nor ever sufficiently to be lamented, and abhorred Villanies, this Mur∣ther I say, and these Villanies were defended, justyfied, nay ex∣tolled, and commended, by one Mr. John Milton, in answer to the most learned Salmasius, who

declaimed against the same, with most Solid Arguments; and Pathe∣ticall Expressions; in which answer he did so bespatter the white Robes of your Royall Fathers spotless life, (humane infirmities excepted) with the dirty filth of his satyricall pen, that to the vulgar, and those who read his book with prejudice, he represented him, a most debauched vitious man, (I tremble Royall Sir to write it,) an irrelegious hater, and persecutor of Religion, and Religi∣ous men, an ambitious inslaver of the Nation, a bloudy Tyrant, and an inplacable Enemy to all his good Subjects, and thereupon calls that execrable, and detestable horrible Murther a just execution, and com∣mends it as an Heroick Action, and

in a word, whatever was done in prosecution of their malice toward your Royall Progenitor, and his Issue, or Relations, or Friends, and asistants, he calls restoring the Na∣tion to its Liberty. Yea to make your illustrious Father more odious in their eyes, where he by any means could fixe his scandals he would not spare that incomparable piece of his writing, (his ) but in a scurrilous reply thereto, which he intituled () he would not spare his devout Prayers (which no doubt the Lord hath heard, and will bear) in all which he expressed, as his inveterate, and causeless malice, so a great deal of wicked desperate wit and learning, most unworthily mis∣bestowed, abused, and misapplyed,

to the reviling of his Prince, Gods vicegerenton Earth, and the speak∣ing ill of the Ruler of the People. Now although your Majesty nor your Royall Father, neither of you need vindication, (much lesse that e∣laborate work of his) nor doth any thing he hath written in Aspersion of his Soveraign, deserve Answer, (ab∣solutely considered) yet forasmuch as he hath in both shewed dangerous wit and wicked Learning, which to∣gether with Elegance in expression is alwaies, (in some measure at least) perswasive with some, and because in these last and worst daies, those dan∣gerous times are come, in which ma∣ny account Treason to be Saintship and the madnesse of People like the inundation of waters, hath for ma∣ny

years overflowed all the bounds of both duty, and obedience to Superi∣ors, and Subjection with Loyalty to their Soveraigns, but especially because in these your Kingdoms, by due title, and birthright, Allegiance conscientiously adhered to, is reputed malignity; and treachery only, and re∣bellion hath for many years been the badge of a confiding man, or a mo∣dern Saint, the poyson of such books in short time creepes farre, and infects many, who perhaps before reading of them were conscientiously Loyall, insomuch that I account it no Soloe∣cism to affirm, that dangerous, villa∣nous wits misapplyed, have done more mischief with their Pens, then the Soldier with his weapons, to your Majesties cause, for by such Books

and pamphlets the inconsiderate Sol∣dier, that before was but your mer∣cenary Enemy, is now perswaded, that in reviling your sacred Person, casting off your Authority, and resis∣ting your restauration, he both serves and pleaseth God, on which Conside∣rations dread Soveraign, I oft wisht, with sighs, that still some able pen would undertake to confute such trac∣tates, which together with malice to your Cause and interest, manifested dexterity of wit in glozing their Ar∣guments, and traducing your sacred Person, royall stock and family, but alas, to my grief, I found all men a∣fraid and deserting, or at least for∣bearing with their Pen to defend that Majesty, which God hath for so ma∣ny years so graciously defended by his

providence, by which means your Enemies grow numerous, strong, and confident, being so backed, and abet∣ted, by such who make it their Work to fill mens ears with surmises, and false Rumors concerning your Ma∣jesties Person, and inclination, as taking for granted your Royall Fa∣ther was indeed such as he was repre∣sented by these defamers and Scan∣dalizers of not only most innocent, but most piously excellent Majesty, and upon this score they have kept out your Majesty thus long, untill according to what the Apostle determinately concludes of such persons as have been your excluders, These evill men and seducers have so daily grown worse and worse, and their impiety, and vil∣lany, not to your Majesties Royall

person only, and Relations, but to the whole Nation in generall, and at length the City of London in par∣ticular, is made so apparent to all men, that now many of your Ma∣jesties Subjects, begin to be unde∣ceived by the unmasking of your Enemies, who of late with the Devil have apparently shewed their Cloven Foot, so that your Restaura∣tion is generally wished, and hoped for, and expected of all, but such whose Villanies have made them every way so obnoxious, that they stand in fear of all Lawfull Autho∣rity, and therefore fear the return of your Majesty, as inconsistent with their safety; which makes them leave no stone unturned to hinder (if possi∣ble) this so great expected happi∣nesse

to these sadly languishing, yea even almost ruined Nations, whose Cure under God lies so in your Majesties Restitution, that scarce any but sees it evidently. Yet these Juglers of State, use their utmost endeavour to cast a Mist before the people, and by Sophistry would per∣swade them, That that is dange∣rous for them, which must be under God their only Cure, and sole Remedy, for these (other∣wise fatall) Distractions. Among many of whom, Mr. Milton comes on the Stage in post hast, and in this juncture of time, that he may (if possible) overthrow the Hopes of all Good men, endeavours (what he can) to divert those that at present sit at Helme, and by

fair pretenses, and Sophisticate Arguments, would easily delude an inconsiderate Reader into a be∣lief, First, That the Govern∣ment of a Republique is in it self, incomparably to be preferred before Kingship, whether we re∣spect men as men, or as Christi∣ans. But Secondly, as the Case stands with us, he would strike us into a fear, namely, That to re∣admit your Majesty, is unsafe, and hazardable, at the best, and may prove dangerous and rui∣nous to all: Conclusions which a Loyal Breast would at first hearing, both abhorre and tremble at: Yet (as he with his fallacious pre∣tenses seems to varnish them over) not hardly to be distilled into such

especially, who in these times of Antimonarchicall Principles, have been before poysoned with prejudice against your Majesties Royal Fa∣ther, who lost his Life in defense of that, which Sophisticate Scri∣blers have since perswaded the de∣luded Vulgar, was attained by his Death, namely Liberty, the name and pretense of which (but reall slavery) hath been pursued with vast Expense both of Bloud and Treasure, so undiscerning are the Vulgar. No marvel then, if they be easily deluded by specious falla∣cies, instead of Solid Arguments, betwixt which they are not able to discern; which I taking notice of, and meeting with this forementioned Pamphlet of Mr. Miltons, and

upon perusall of it, finding it dan∣gerously insnaring, the fallacy of the Arguments being so cunningly hidden, as not to be discerned by any, nor every Eye; observing also, the Language to be smooth and tempting, the Expressions pathe∣tical, and apt to move the Affecti∣ons, but withall the drift of it to be of desperate consequence, name∣ly to undoe (if possible) all our hopes, to continue our misery, still upon us, nay to settle and fix it ir∣reparably, I thought it my duty (in these respects) to undertake this professed Republican Cham∣pion, and to discover his fallacies, by which he labours at unawares to insnare (if it may be done) such who are otherwise Judicious: And

this I judged my duty more espe∣cially, because it was received by many with Applause, and stumbled severall whom it could not seduce, if not to reject, yet to suspect and be jealous of Monarchy, or at least to lay aside your Majesty, as an unsafe person, and set up another. This (most Judicious Prince) was the true Inducement of me to this Undertaking, especially because I saw none of a more dexterous Wit, to save me the labour, by appearing in your Majesties (acci∣dentally necessary, but absolutely most just) Vindication, which though the Accomplishment of your Princely merits need not in the least, yet your Subjects want it, lest by the poyson of the Times

they be infected, and for the Re∣covery of such, who are stumbled as to their Resolutions, notwith∣standing their Affections may be Loyally Cordiall: To which end if any Pains of mine may conduce, though but a little, I shall have sufficient reward in the satisfaction that will thence redound to my spirit. In addressing to your Majesty this inconsiderable Labour, Pardon Dread Soveraign my presumption, since my reall Intentions herein were not to expect your acceptance of it, but to beg humbly your Royal Pardon for this boldnesse, the first being far beyond my deserts, and the other genuine to your Natu∣rall Princely Disposition. My chief feare is, (most Gracious

Prince) lest I deservedly reap your Majesties disfavour, for attempting a thing, the due performance where∣of, (considering the ability of the Author to whom this is returned in Reply) might call for a farre more ready wit, and solid judgement then I can without folly ever hope for; however, what is done, I can seriously professe in doing of it, my most unfeigned Desire to have only been to serve your Majesties most just Interest, and as far as in me lies, to undeceive as many as I can of your Subjects, who by such injurious, and most unwor∣thy Endeavours, to darken your Royall Lustre may have been staggered, either in their cordial Affections, or unsetled in their

Constant Resolutions toward you; for whose prosperity, and speedy Restitution to your Just Heredi∣tary Rights, and long, and happy injoyment of the same, hath been, is, and shall be (God assisting) the con∣stant Prayer of
