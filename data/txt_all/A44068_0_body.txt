LADIES.
WHen I consider how great a losse you have both sufferd, and in how nigh a relation, I confess (my own share being so large there∣in) I have not onely a deepe sence thereof, but also a great compassion for you. Tis true there is
 nothing on this side heaven in my poor opinion able to recompence and fully to make this up unto you; being not onely of a person so eminent in point of worth, but also of so large, and tender affection and care for both your welfares: yet is not heaven dis∣furnished, or scanted in this respect; He who is the fountaine of all creature good, and the source of all relations, being able by his owne presence and emana∣tiones to shew himself a Husband to the widdow, and a father to the fatherless: It being a work of dig∣nation, but not of jndigence that God makes use of any jnstrument to convey comfort, or blessing to us; He being altogether as able to effect that for our good without as with their helpe.
The excellencies parceld out to severall beings are nothing but the over flowings of the great God, in whom they all are after a supereminent manner, and Infinitely in point of degree: if therfore, what he dealt out by his instrument heretofore he now dispenceth more imenediately from his owne hand, it must needs prove more sweet, satisfaction, lay a greater engage∣ment upon you to himself, considering his condescenti∣on, affection, sufficiency, & immutability, herein being wholy free from all those scantnesses and changes that
 either render our choisest creature supports & props unable to supply, or quickly uanishing when we expect the greatest benefit from them. And what greater wis∣dome can we shew, then when at once we elect to our selves the greatest and most stable good in whom there is no shew nor shaddow of change, and also therein pursue our vltimate safe making end, in the attaining of which we finde a center of ever lasting rest and compleat happiness. Now the designe of these curt and confused notes (conceived in the midst of great sad∣ness and distraction) being to point out and bring to mental veiw this invisible good and its compleatnesse in reference to our eternall welfare: the weightinesse of the subject concernes you upon that common account mentioned by holy David as being of the number of that brood of travailers who seek the face of the God of Jacob, but after a special manner as stript of the greatest ornament and worldly prop, that you may see at once both what higth of Glory and eminent exal∣tation our deceased friend is a rived at; and also what marke we ought our selves to aim at that we may one day meet in the highest pitch of glory inse∣perably to solace our selves in our masters joy to all
 eternity. Which that you may reach in the onely way Christ Jesus and by the only meanes of a lively faith that workes by love is and shall ever be the hearty prayers of.
