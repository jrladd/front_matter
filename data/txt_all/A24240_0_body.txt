SIR,
HAving heard of your Fame, and
of your industrious and vigi∣lant
Endeavours into the Ma∣thematicall
rare Inventions, (e∣ven
in your younger years,)
and especially into that famous and noble
Art of Navigation; and that from the mouth
of a Credible Person, who was at that time
a Teacher of the Mathematicks at London:
have therefore made bold (tho unacquain∣ted)
to present You with a second Edition
of this Enchiridion, or, smal Treatise; to be
sheltered under the Protection of Your Pa∣trocinie:
Whom, (I trust) is able to de∣fend

and assist me, in Truth and Veritie, a∣gainst
all malevolent and backbiting Op∣posers;
who through their blind igno∣rance,
doth falsly check us of Truths, and
some small oversights: as may be seen into
the Tyde-Table of Lieth, Printed into an Al∣manack
at Edinburgh, for this present year
1683: set forth by James Paterson Mathema∣tician.
Wherefore, expecting your favou∣rable
Acceptance, of this small Embryo,
which shall ere long incourage me, to pub∣lish
abroad a larger Treatise, on that excel∣lent
Art of Navigation, for the speciall use
of all our Loyal brave Sea-men and Mariners,
whose painfull Labours tend much for the
Good of this Ancient KINGDOM. Thus
wishing You, and all the Worthie Frater∣nitie
of Masters of the Trinitie-house at
Lieth, all happiness here in this World, and
Eternall Mansions of Joy in the World to
come: I ever remain,
SIR,
