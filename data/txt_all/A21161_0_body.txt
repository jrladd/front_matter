RIGHT HONORABLE, and my very good Lord, (pre∣suming
vppon your curtesy) J am bolde to present vnto your honor, this small
volume: Entituled, The Paradise of deynty deuises, being penned by diuers
learned Gentlemen, and collected togea∣ther, through the trauell of one, both
of woorship and credite, for his priuate vse: who not long since departed
this lyfe, which when J had perused ouer, not with out the aduise of
sundry my freendes, J determined by theyr good motion, to set them in
print, who thervnto greatly per∣swaded me, with these and like woordes: The
wryters of them, were both of honor and worship: besides that, our owne
coun∣trey men, and such as for theyr learnyng and grauitie, might be
accounted of a∣mong
 the wisest. Furthermore, the ditties both pithy
and pleasant, aswell for the inuention as meter, and wyll yeelde a farre
greater delight, being as they are so aptly made to be set to any song in
.5. partes, or song to instrument. Which wel consydering, J
purposed not to forsake so good an occasion, beseeching your honor to
accept it in good part, cheefely for the aucthours sake: who though some of
them are departed this lyfe, yet theyr woorthy doings shall continue for
euer: for like as the shadow foloweth the body, so praise foloweth
vertue: and as the shadow goeth somtimes before, and sometimes behind,
so doth praise also to vertue: but the later it commeth, the greater it
is, and to be the better esteemed. Thus fearing to offende your honor with
these my rude speaches, J end, wishing your L. many yeres of ioy.
