THe Fame of
your Lord∣ships
Gal∣lantry ha∣ving
alrea∣dy
spread it
self throughout all Italy,The Au∣thors first Epistle De∣dicatory, in the Parls Edition, published by J. Gaf∣farel. by rea∣son
of the report of your Lord∣ships

being chosen his Majesties
Ambassadour, as the most Pru∣dent
Person, to the most Prudent
State of Venice: whilest all others,
that are any whit addicted to the
Crown of France, applaud this
Election; and all persons of
Worth, and Learning, earnestly
expect your Lordships Entrance
upon this Charge; give Me leave
also, as one of the least of your
Lordships Servants, to Congra∣tulate
this your Honour. And,
since None might appear before
the Lord, Empty-handed; I have
also made bold to present your
Lorship with this small Gift;
which is, The History of the Man∣ner
of Life, Rites, and Customes of
my own Nation, at this Present:

Which being dispersed through∣out
the whole World, the Subject
is therefore so much the more
Proportionate to the Vastnesse of
your Lordships Knowledge, and
Imployment, which pretends to
a General Insight in Humane Af∣faires.
Neither do I despair of be∣ing
Favourably received by your
Lordship, since I perceive, that
all the Muses of Italy are of the
same Judgment with Me; and
all, with one Consent, strive to
proclaim your Lordships Praises
to the World, in making Dedica∣tions
of the Choicest Fruits that
the most Learned Academies have
ever yet brought forth: Beseech∣ing
your Lordship courteously to
entertain, not the Gift onely, but

the Perpetual Service also of the
Doner; whose continual Prayer
shall be, that your Lordship may
be crowned, with all, both Earth∣ly,
and Heavenly Blessings.
Venice, Jan.
12. 1637.
