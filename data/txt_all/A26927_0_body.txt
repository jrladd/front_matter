May it please your Majesty,
I Have been too long silent, and am afraid, by my silence, I have neglected the duty of the place it hath pleased God to call me unto, and your Majesty to place me in. And now I humbly crave leave, I may discharge my conscience to∣wards God, and my duty to your Majesty. And therefore I beseech your Majesty, give me leave freely to deliver my self, and then let your Ma∣jesty do with me what You please. Your Majesty hath propounded a Toleration of Religion: I be∣seech you Sir, take into your consideration, what the Act is, next what the Consequence may be. By your Act you labour to set up that most dam∣nable,

and heretical Doctrine of the Church of Rome, whore of Babylon. How hatefull will it be to God, and grievous unto Your good Sub∣jects, the true professors of the Gospel; that your Majesty, who hath often disputed, and learnedly written against those wicked Heresies, should now shew Your self a Patron of those Doctrines, which Your Pen hath told the World, and Your Consci∣ence tells Your self, are superstitious, idolatrous, and detestable. Besides, this Toleration which You endeavour to set up by Proclamation, cannot be done without a Parliament, unlesse your Ma∣jesty will let your Subjects see, that You will take unto your self a liberty to throw down the Laws of the Land at your pleasure. What dreadfull con∣sequence these things may draw after them, I be∣seech your Majesty to consider. And above all, lest by this Toleration, and discontinuance of the true profession of the Gospel, whereby God hath blessed u, and under which this Kingdome hath for many yeares flourished, Your Majesty do not draw upon the Kingdome in generall, and your self in particular, Gods heavy wrath and in∣dignation Thus in discharge of my duty towards God, to your Majesty, and the place of my calling, I have taken humble boldnesse to deliver my con∣science. And now, Sir, doe with me what you please.
