THis follow∣ing Essay, long since written by the Au∣thor for his private
 satisfaction, is now by his consent made common, & for pub∣like view. It con∣taines in it, a nar∣ration of the greatest change, that ever happened in the Common-wealth and state of Rome. Yet not a naked Story nor a bare Narra∣tion onely; but a

 and to subscribe my selfe
