TO the wide World I Dedicate this Glass,
To shew a Wonder that must come to pass;
The World's New-Birth, and Gallantry Refin'd,
To a more solid and substantial Kind.
And because much in few I would express,
I write my mind in plain an pithy Verse.
For lo, in my divining thoughts I see,
The last fulfilling of that Mystery,
Which sacred Scriptures have concealed long
Vnder a Vail, or dark Prophetick Song:
The Gentiles fulness with that wonderous news,
The Calling and Conversion of the Jews.
A promis'd truth, which few or none believes,
Though for that Day the whole Creation grieves.
But Time will cut each mystick knot in sunder,
That God may have the Honour of the Wonder:
For then Jew and Gentile both, shall know
There is a God can bring the Haughty Low.
Perhaps the sound may rouse some Prince or Peere,
Now to begin the Worlds Reforming Year,
To stop the stream of Vice, and turn the Tyde,
Of Wrath and Lust, Debauchery and Pride;
And, as the Rising Sun, with Powerful Light
Dispel the darkness of the Worlds long Night;
That all the World New-born may speak one Tongue,
Or no man think or do his Neighbour Wrong:
For such by right all Mankind ought to be,
And so make good this following History.
Art thou a Master of Israel, and knowest not these things? â€” Namely, Thine own New-Birth, and the Worlds New-Birth to come, John 3.10.
