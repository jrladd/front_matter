Much esteemed in the Lord,
WHat you lately recei∣ved
from the Pulpit,
take here from the
Presse, that what
was then Transient
in the Eare, may be now Permanent
to the Eye. Weake bodies which
are subject to Heart-tremblings
and faintings, use to have their Cor∣dials,
or Strong-waters by them.

To like purpose serveth this Extract,
intended for an Aqua Coelestis, for
the fortifying of your Spirits (in these
times of Common Danger) against
what ever feares or dangers you may
happily encounter with. If you shall
have neede, make use of it; otherwise
let it remaine by you; I dare assure you,
it will be no ill store. However, I shall
leave it with you, and rest
