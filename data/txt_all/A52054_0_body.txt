Right Honourable:
MY earnest desire to help quench the flames of our
Church-divisions, which threaten destructi∣on
to us all, put mee upon the study of this
Theame, when I was called to Preach at your
late solemne Anniversary meeting; the same
desire hath perswaded me to yeeld ready obedience to your Or∣der
for the publishing of it. I doubt not, but as it was the
prayer of our blessed Saviour, That all his Saints might
be one; so it is the desire of all true Christians, that Jesus
Christ would make all his to be of one mind, and of one heart,
and when they cannot be of one minde, yet to be of one heart,
and I am as assured, that in his due time he will effect it;

when that blessed time is approaching, such Doctrines, as this
plaine Sermon holds forth, will be more seriously studied, and
more readily imbraced, then they are at this day.
If this mite may contribute any thing to it, yea, if it doe
but provoke divided and ingaged men, to search the Scrip∣tures,
whether these things here delivered be true, or not, and
especially, if it occasion some other of his servants, who have
obtained greater ability, and more leasure, to arise, and put
their hand to this worke of reconciliation, and pacification;
I should then hope, that the Day-star of our peace begun to
appear; however, I have peace in the discharge of my duty,
and humbly commend the healing of all our breaches to him,
who is the Prince of peace; to him also I commend your selves
and your great work, and subscribe my selfe,
