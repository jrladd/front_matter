Most Reverend,
WEre I indeed a greater Master of
Verse, than the best of those,
whether of our own Country-Men,
or Foreigners, whose several manners I
have in the following Compositions, endeavoured
to imitate, I durst not yet presume to make an
humble Present of them to your Grace, un∣less
invited by the Sacredness of the most noble
Argument. An Argument so Sacred (as to the
greatest part of the Subjects, if not spoil'd by

my unskilful handling) that it must be ever
acknowledged worthy your Grace; and, be∣side
that the best and most refined Spirits of the
Christian Church have happily labour'd in them,
whose Design his late MAJESTY of ever
Blessed Memory, was particularly pleased
to Encourage and Promote. To attest this,
were it either necessary, or pertinent, I might
reckon up several Names, not unknown to
your Grace, but shall, instead of all, con∣tent
my self with the generally approved Mr.
George Sandy's, who first under so Excel∣lent
a Prince, opened the way to Divine Poesy
in this Nation, and gave it a more than or∣dinary
Credit; from whose Hands, as not
unbecoming His Royal Self, He vouch∣safed
to accept a short Paraphrase upon the
Canticles; not long after the time that the
Pious Sieur Godeau had with much success
made a Dedication of the same Divine Song,

under the Title of Sacred Eclogues, with
some few other Religious Stanzas to the great
Cardinal Richelieu of France.
For Honours sake I here mention the Bishop
of Grasse, and Mr. Sandy's, and that there∣by
I may both Apologize for my self, if
there be need, and defend the best that I can
against the most Censorious and Critical, the
affixing your Graces Name, to the same
Canticles, and a few other English Rimes;
of which, for the performance, as being my
own, tho I have no better opinion than I ought,
or than the great Judges of Verse in the Town
shall allow they deserve (it may be not so good)
yet if, as in the first place in this Dedication,
they are intended, they shall serve most hum∣bly
to express my Duty without reflection of
Dishonour upon your Grace, and be so re∣ceived,
I shall nor wish for my self greater
Credit, nor for them a better Recommenda∣tion

to such as have any gust for Christian
Poesy.
That God Almighty may have your Grace
in his perpetual and most mercifull Protection,
and long, very long continue you an invaluable
Blessing to this his best of Churches, is the
daily Prayer of
Hartley Malduit,
Hampsh. 1678.
Most Reverend,
