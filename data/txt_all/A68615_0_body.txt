SIR,
IF the Greatnesse of Kings de∣rive its value and lustre from the number of Vertues which they possesse; I render you now the homage of my observance, and submissions, as to one of the greatest Mo∣narchs of the World, since you are the Majestie of all Vertues together. What an agreeable compulsion is this, to see a man's selfe powerfully forced to become
the subject of a foraine Prince, by the sove∣raigne authoritie of his merit? To this point am I reduced, SIR, your all-royall perfections impose upon me so absolutely such sweet lawes of servitude, that I have no more libertie, but to accept its yoake. And in this, my inclination and dutie make a fresh injunction o're me, which dispute preheminence with all the rest: for who can keepe himselfe from ren∣dring homage to your Majestie, the onely fame of whose Renowne captivates through all the Ʋniverse, instructing us, that you are as absolute over your Pas∣sions, as over your Subjects; and that you reigne as Soveraigne in the esteeme of men, as in your Royall Estates: And the Truths of this set your glory at so high a worth, that the felicitie on't may perhaps be envied you, but the like Merit not to be reacht by others, because Nature is very sparing of the like gifts, and Heaven
does not every day such miracles. For me, I am but one of the Admirers, not of the greatnesse of your Dominion (although onely the vast extent of the Ocean markes out its limits) but of all the divine qualities which you onely possesse in proper as a Good, which Time, Fate, nor Death can take from you. Nor is this the all in all, to be Wise, Valiant, and Generous, in the height of Native deduction; All these Titles of Honour have degrees of eminence, which marke out to us the gradations of their severall perfections, and whereof your Majestie shewes us now the onely patterne, having in possession all admirable Vertues, with so much puritie and luster, as dazles its very envyers, and forces them to adore that in your Majestie, which elsewhere they admire not. And 'tis my beleefe, that you stand thus unparallel'd even amongst your semblables, since be∣sides the Crownes of your Cradle, you
carry above them others, and such as shall exempt you from the Grave. I avow, that I have studied long time to speake condignely of your Majestie; but al∣though my paines and watchings are equally unprofitable, my defect yet is still glorious howsomever, that it is a shadow from your Light. It sufficeth me to have taken Pen in hand, to publish onely, that I am
SIR,
