Most Renowned Prelate,
IN that I still become troublesom to your greater Cares, by this Kind of often repeated Duty, I must also repeat my former Excuse. For that these my VVritings, with those formerly Published, for the most part consist of those things which I have delivered in my Academical Read∣ings, by a necessitated Duty belong to you, for that I recei∣ved them from your Favours; and indeed, neither these had ever seen the Light, nor perhaps my self had ever been in the number of Authors, unless I had been made at first your Sidlie Professor at Oxford; yours I say, both for the ancient Honour with which you had advanced me, and also for the more fresh magnificent Liberality, which has ob∣liged the whole Academy, and all its Gowned Company.

And althô I have a place of Safety, in that the Arguments and Reasons fight on my Side, and that I have got the Suffrages of the ancient Philosophers, and the holy Fathers (and especially of St. Hierome and Augustine, and among the Moderns of Gassendus and our Hammond) yet suffer your Grace for my greater Safety, to extend your help to me, and grant that I may profess in the Entrance to this Dis∣course, that I am
