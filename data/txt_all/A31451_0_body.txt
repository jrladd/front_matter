Madam,
THough the time, allowed me to prepare for the bearing that part I sustained at the Funeral of your Honoured Lord, was but short (that worthy Person, to whom that Province was first committed, falling sick some days before the solemnizing of it) yet the Defe∣rence I bare to the Memory of that Great Good Man, and the hopes of being serviceable to the Glory of God, and the Good of some who might be present in so numerous an Au∣ditory, prevailed with me to attempt the Discharge of it as well as I could.
And it seems, some favourable Auditors of that plain Sermon, then preached (which your own Retirement through Sorrow, did not permit your Honour to hear) have given you that account of it, that your Honour judges it may be of
 use and benefit to others to read, to excite them to live in the Lord, that they also may dye in the Lord, and be eter∣nally happy.
If therefore, when your Honour shall have read this Dis∣course your self, it shall appear to your pious Judgment, like∣ly to be further useful to that good end, for which I preached it, and your Honour now desires the publishing of it, I hum∣bly submit it to your Honours pleasure and disposal. And as I shall follow it with my Prayers to God, that it may prosper to the encouragement of humble and pious persons who shall read it; so also shall I beg of him, in whose sight the death of his Servants is precious, that he will build up a lasting Mo∣nument to the Memory of your Pious Lord, by causing his Lordship that now is, and the rest of his Generous Off-spring, always to imitate this their great Domestick Exemplar; that so your Honour may still be a Naomi, Ruth 1.20. and that the Remainder of your Days may be blessed in them, as your many Years have been, wherein you lived with your most excellent and pious Consort.
MADAM,
