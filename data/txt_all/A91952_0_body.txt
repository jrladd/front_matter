My LORD,
TO pretend an Ignorance of Your Person, which your Loy∣alty, (the only Embellisher of all other Vertues) has ren∣dered so Eminently Famous, and thence frame an Apologe∣tique Preface, to usher in this Address to Your Lordship, would be a Crime greater than the Presumption, and an unpardo∣nable Offence against that Goodness, which ne∣ver frowned on the meanest payment of that ibute Your Merits justly challenge from all

Men: 'Tis that, My Lord, which imboldens me, Humbly to present Your Lordship with this Translation of a Modern History, written Ori∣ginally by the Duke of ROHAN, a Prince, whose Valour, and other Rare Accomplish∣ments, not inferiour to the most Eminent of his time, had rendered his Reputation as clear, as great, had they not been unfortunately employed against a Party, in which his King was interessed (Religion it self having not power sufficient to Authorize Armes, raised by Subjects against their Soveraign) for one which payed all his ser∣vices with Calumny and Detraction.
But far from me be the presumption to direct Your Lordships Judgement of his Exploits, ei∣ther in the Camp, or Cabinet; either of his Sword, or Pen; which I was principally induced to publish in our Language, by some passages tending to the Vindication of our late incompa∣rable King, and Martyr, from no less false, than foule aspersions concerning Rochelle, (His care and diligence to order their relief, being here ac∣knowledged by persons more concerned, than our pretended Propagators of Religion, the Ro∣chellers ruine being chiefly occasioned by their own Inconstancy, refusing to admit those suc∣cours when come, which they before, even with tears implored, and their own intestine divisions and factions) with which His Blasphemous, and Rebellious Subjects, first sought to wound His Fame, that with more security they might im∣brew

their Hands in His most Sacred Blood: And knowing how zealous an Assertor Your Lordship has alwayes shewen Your Self, both of His Rights and Innocence; and how indefatigable, (though with the hazard of the dearest Trea∣sures, both of Your Life, and Fortune) Your Industry has been, for the restoring of His Ma∣jesty, (by God's Miraculous Providence now Reigning over us) even in those times, when Treason having usurped the Throne, Rewards and Punishments were with such prodigious Im∣piety misplaced, that Loyalty was daily crucifi∣ed, when Villany was cherished, and advanced; nor were our very thoughts exempt from the Tyrant's barbarous Inquisitions; I could not more justly offer it to the Patronage of any, than Your Lordship; together with him, who, with Your Lordships pardon, humbly begs the Ho∣nour to subscribe himself,
My LORD,
