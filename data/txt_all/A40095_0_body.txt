Gentlemen,
THo' I was not difficultly perswaded
to comply with your Request,
that I would be your Preacher,
as little Time, as I truly foresaw I should
be Master of, to prepare a Discourse
proper for the Occasion; yet I could

not consent to your desire of having
this, which you heard, Printed (as re∣ally
not thinking it worthy to be made
more publick) till you were pleased
to back it with such Importunities, as
I could not withstand, without the im∣putation
of Incivility. I therefore here
Present you with it, most earnestly
wishing, and humbly praying, it may
do that Service, which your Zeal for
the promoting of Love and Good
Works induced you to think it fitted
for, and remain,
GENTLEMEN,
