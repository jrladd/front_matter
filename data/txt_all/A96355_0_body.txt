COurteous Reader, (you know, and I know, that) the Wits of this Age are acute and vari∣ous, therefore how to please all mens fancies is a Taske too ponde∣rous for my undertaking. I have here unlock't and opened to your
view a rich Cabinet of varieties; If there be any thing therein con∣teined that may yeeld you profit, solace of the mind, recreation of the spirits, or content, I shall think my labour well bestowed, and be glad; If it be otherwise, I shall be sorry that I have no∣thing therein to please your mind, intreating you to shut downe the lid againe, and then I hope there is no hurt done.
This may be compared to a Garden composed of sundry varieties, wherein you may pick and cull out those Flowers which best pleaseth you, and are fittest for your pleasure or profit: For the laborious Bee
gathereth her cordiall Honey, and the venemous Spider her corro∣ding poyson many times from one Flower. And I know that there are some envious Criticks that will snarle at me for publish∣ing many things conteined herein; But I care the lesse, because I ayme at the publique and no private end; And no Man (I think) should be borne only to himself, and hide his Talent: And there∣fore these few Receits which I have collected, with divers of mine owne, (gentle Reader) I de∣dicate freely to thy use; Knowing that Art imitating Nature, glories alwaies in the variety of things which she produceth, to satisfie
the minds of curious Inquisitors of Naturall and Artificiall Con∣clusions. Therefore I doubt not but there are many things contei∣ned in this small Volume that will give satisfaction to the In∣genious, for whose sakes I have compiled it: So taking leave, I will ever remain
