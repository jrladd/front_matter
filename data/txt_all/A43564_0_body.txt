May it Please Your Honour,
WHEN I first intended to Dedi∣cate these Poems to Your Name, beside the Thoughts of their Un∣worthiness, I Was chiefly deterr'd by the Consideration of these Two Things, the Greatness of Your Quality and the Perspi∣cuity of your Judgment: But then I was a little Encourag'd again, when I reflected, that the Meanest Creature was not debarr'd ma∣king Address to the Highest of Beings, but was rather commanded it; and that the Er∣rours and Mistakes of well-meaning Men are likely to become rather the Pity, than the Scorn of Angels. Nor could I think it less, than a Natural Duty; that my humble Muse should offer the Best of Her Increase to that Family, to whose Bounty and Encouragement She ows all She is; since even the Gratefull Indians ne∣ver Eat or Drink, till they have first powred out a Part as an Offering to that Bright Lu∣minary, from whole Influence they believe, All, they receive doth proceed.
I am very sensible and cannot but acknow∣ledge,

that there are many Things lyable to Exception in the Ensuing Poems; but they may well be Pardon'd, for the Sake of the Begin∣ning, which is Consecrate to Your Name, and thereby receives a Peculiar Grace and Advan∣tage, which cannot but diffuse it self thrô the whole Work. I confess even there what belongs to Me is full of Weakness; but it could be no otherwise, since in Subjects so Sublime, as Your Self, the most Towring Flights must of necessity flag, Things too High above Us not admitting a Definition; and as in Beauteous Faces there is something, We cannot Name, that exceeds the Pencil's Art, so in Excellent Perso∣nages there are Vertues, of which Common Souls have no Notion; but they Soar above the De∣scription of the Loftiest Fancy. And surely no One is to be blam'd for going no farther; if He goes as far as the Subject will bear: For He is not ty'd to Impossibilities. And doubtless thô Poetry is usually suspected of Flattery, yet any One, who considers the Charms of Your Beau∣ty, the Sharpness of Your Wit, the Depth of Your Judgment, the Candour of Your Tem∣per, and Nobility of your Birth, will acknow∣ledge, that You are plac'd above the reach of it; that, which would be Flattery to another, not

measuring the least Part of Your Perfections; so that, if the Boldest and most Happy Genius should take the utmost bounds of Poetick Li∣berty in order to Praise Your Merit, He would find the Folly of his Attempt, and soon be for∣ced with Confusion to give over the Impossible Design. For I suppose, there is None, but will grant, that the Highest-Encomiums in Praise of the Sun are lost; every One having a Greater Idea of that Luminary than can be express'd, and He is still as far above their Praise, as their Reach. Wherefore if Princes are best able to de∣scribe the secrets of Empire, Experienc'd Com∣manders matters of War, and Gallant Minds Heroick Vertues, I am inexcusably to blame, who have undertaken a Province too Difficult for Me to perform, and which requires the Pen of something more than a Man; which Crime I yet humbly beg Your Honour to forgive; since thô there may ly a Fault in my Ignorance and Rashness, yet, I am sure, there is none in the Design; since there is no One hath a Greater Zeal, for the Glory of Your Honourable Family, than He, who is
(MADAM)
