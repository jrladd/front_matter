Honoured Sirs,
THe many testimonies of your real af∣fection towards this pious and learn∣ed Authour, (especially while he lay under the discipline of so sad a Pro∣vidence) deserve all thankful acknowledgement, and grateful commemoration: which I doubt not but himself would have made in most am∣ple manner, had it pleased God to have granted him longer life, and farther opportunity. But since Divine Providence hath otherwayes dispo∣sed; I thought it no solecisme in friendship to undertake the Executorship of his desires, and

so farre to own his debt of gratitude, as to en∣deavour some Publike acknowledgement of it, though the greatnesse of your benefits admit not of just reompence and satisfaction. Having therefore the disposal of his papers committed to me by his nearest and dearest friends, and finding them to be of such worth and excellen∣cy as ought not to be smothered in obscurity; I interpreted this a fit opportunity to let both your selves and others understand, how deep an impression your kindnesse to him hath left in the apprehensions and memories of those his friends, whom God and Nature had given the advantage of being more peculiarly interessed in his wel∣fare. Upon which account I do here present you with this Elegant issue of his noble and gallant abilities; which, besides the relation it hath to you by the Fathers side, would gladly intitle it self unto your acceptance and protection, as ha∣ving been conceived in your Colledge, and deli∣vered in your Chappel; and therefore hopes that you, who with much delight were sometimes ear-witnesses of it, will now become its Susce∣ptours.
And thus having lodged it in its Mothers armes, I leave it to her embraces. On whose be∣half

I shall only offer up this serious and hearty wish; That as, by the blessing of heaven upon her fruitful womb, she hath been made a Mother of many profitable instruments both in Church and Common-wealth: so God would be pleased to make good her name unto her, and delight still to use her as the handmaid-instrument of his glo∣ry; that he would lay her topstone in his blessing, as her foundation was laid in his fear.
