My Lord,
THat I presume to devote these Pa∣pers to your great Name, when so perfect a Stranger to your Person, may savour a little of Rudeness and Irreverence: Yet your Lordship ve∣ry well knows, that a more refined Ac∣quaintance is attainable with Spirits at a distance, where the divine Idea's of the great Soul have Drawn themselves out
to the very Life in the visible Characters of their own Excellency, which have not fail'd to dragg after them (as into an easie and pleasing Captivity) the entire Affections and absolute Obedience of others, as the natural Fruit of their Victory. Thus we pay Homage to the very Saints in Heaven, and to all Meritorious and Eminent Persons on Earth, dignifying our selves by frequent and familiar Con∣verses with them, though perhaps exalt∣ed into mighty Stations, far above the low Sphere of our meanness and humble Estate.
'Tis this Prospect, My Lord, made into the sublimer Forms of your spiritual Part, that hath fix'd me your perfect Captive, and given birth to this bold In∣trusion. (But if sometimes the inferiou Dependants on the Court Ensure them∣selves of a gracious Reception, when th come charg'd but with a Message from
the Sovereign to you, I am certain you will not shut your Gates against me when I come laden with Expresses from Hea∣ven, and recommended too by the Father of the Faithful, and the very Friend of God.) And thô it be little to your Lordship to hear of any New Pretender, yet 'tis Complacency enough to me, when I make the World know how much I honour you for your Self; and with what Plea∣sure and Satisfaction I received the good News of the Presidency of that Church to be lodged in your Lordship, where my Ancestors with my unworthy self for four Generations successively paid the Tribute of Reverence to its Mitre, now Priding t self in so rich an Head as yours; un∣ess perchance it be deprived of that Fe∣icity by the Ambition of another, which ay emulate its Honour, and think it no obbery to succeed in the same Happi∣ess.

May your Lordship long live, the true Heir of Abraham's eximious Faith and Piety, the pleasing Object of your Princes Favour, the Peoples Love, and the De∣sire of all the Churches: so Prays
