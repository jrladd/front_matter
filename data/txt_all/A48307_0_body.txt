THe desire I had to professe
my devoted Service to the
pious designes of your ho∣nourable
Senate, disposed
me to a boldnesse of offe∣ring
this ensuing Dis∣course
by a generall Dedication to your whole
House. But my judgement (upon second co∣gitations)
gave check to that conceit, as ma∣king
too neare an approach, towards some
presumption, and directed me to value it, be∣low
the rate of a competent Present, for so
many, so worthy persons of your Assembly, and
to select some Patron among you for a singu∣lar
inscription. Thence were my thoughts
conducted to your Selfe (noble Sir) to whom

(for your prudent and constant Zeale, to ad∣vance
all just and conscionable causes, and
your many affectionate expressions of respect
to me both present and absent) I held my selfe
obliged to take this opportunity, to tender a
token of a gratefull memory of such favour as
(without the guilt of ungratitude) I can nei∣ther
forget nor forbear to acknowledge. And I
should be as ungodly as ungratefull, if (consi∣dering
your intentive incumbency upon the
common cares of the Church and Stae) I
should not (both in Church and Closet) ad∣dresse
my heartiest devotions to the Lord Al∣mighty,
to preserve your person (with the
rest of your venerable Associates) and to prosper
your consultations with such happy successe, as
my occasion an exchange of prayers into prai∣ses.
In both which sacred Services (with re∣ference
to you and yours, in neerest relations)
none shall be more sincere and serious then he
who will never be wanting,
Great Budworth, Septem. 20. 1641.
