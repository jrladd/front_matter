My Lord,
IT seems not unseasonable or improper to publish these Memoires under your Lord∣ship's Protection, (though Truth needs no Hero to defend her:) the Beauty of Vertue, and ge∣nerous Spirit of Liberty influ∣enced Your glorious Ancestors, and runs still in the Veins and Blood of your Self, and Noble
Family. 'Tis this sublime Cha∣racter that shines so bright in most of the Greek and Latin Writers; this Purity and Majesty of Thought, Stile and Action, elevated the Ancients far above our Level, and rendred them such noble Monuments to Po∣sterity, that at this Day they carry the highest Value, and the greatest Reputation. Where∣as, in the late Ages, we have so far degenerated from the Candor and Sincerity of those Learned Authors, that either Sects in Religion, Factions in the State, or other private In∣terests or Rewards, have made Men deviate so far from the old Rules of History, that the greatest part of the Modern is
more like Romance, design'd to please some sorts of Readers, more than to profit or teach Mankind. Polybius, Lucian and others, foresaw the many Cor∣ruptions that were like to o∣verspread the Writers of Hi∣story; therefore they thought fit to leave behind them some Rules and Methods for pre∣serving its Native Purity.
My Lord,
These Memoires of Count Teckely, seem free from the a∣forementioned Deseases of Hi∣story. Methinks there appears in them something of the an∣cient Air of Thucydides and Li∣vy: The Author casts no Mists
to mislead his Readers, puts on no Mask to deceive the common Eye; all here is na∣ked Matter of Fact, without any superficial Gloss or Artifice, to corrupt the plain simple Truth; and therefore the most fit to be dedicated to your Lordship, by,
My Lord,
