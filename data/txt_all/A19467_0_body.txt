MOst singular, most excellent, most beautifull, most glorious, & most worthy Sauiour, most entirely be∣loued, and most sweet Iesu; in to∣ken of my humblest deuotion I owe vnto thy most sacred selfe, I here dedicate this Mite (entituled Andrewes Petition) which is the true Copy of my loyallest affection vnto thee. And so often from the bottome of my heart I doe salute thee, as there be Angels in heauen,

drops of water in the sea, Starres in the Firmament, leaues on the trees, and grasse on the ground: yea incessantly with all humility, I salute thee in the vnion of loue; and vnto the most blessed and sweet heart of thy own sweet selfe, I do in all dutifull affection assigne my selfe and my dearest loue vnto thee, my sweet and louing Sauiour; (although vnworthy) to be thy ser∣uant; and I most humbly beseech thee, that thou wilt vouchsafe to entertaine and receiue me, that I may be wholly thine; and thou Co-equall with God thy Father, maist be wholly mine: that after my en∣ded miseries thou wilt crowne mee with thy endlesse mercies: vnto this sweet Iesu my Sauiour, say Amen.
And so Amen.
