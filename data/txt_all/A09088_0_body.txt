BOth duety, for honoura∣ble fauours receyued, and intire affection, the spurre that pricketh forward the verie harshest conceite: hath im∣boldened mee to present this trea∣tise to your honours viewe, as a te∣stimonie of good will to shunne the infamous title of ingratitude, as al∣so in some measure to expresse my poore yet vnfeyned zeale, the bold∣nesse of the one (I presume) noble nature wil pardon, the slender ha∣bilitie of the other (I hope) the same will accept.
I know howe far from your ho∣norable

thoughts, sinister opinions are, that might checke the young springing plants, whose forwardnes promise greater mattters to ensue. I know withall, not onely your ho∣norable care to cherish such ende∣uours, but also your prouident and liberall bountie, in supporting any towardly hope from falling. Ouer faint harted might hee then bee thought, that would dismay when doubt is so worthily remooued.
Then boldly (yet as it becōmeth me in duetie) I reuerently deliuer your honour this simple gift: refer∣ring the iudgement both of it and me, to your wonted noble conside∣ration. And as your yeeres, so pray I all blessings of heauen may en∣crease vppon you, to the comfort of such as haue good cause to loue you.
