MY LORD,
THE Common-wealth hath beene compared by many (and that verie fitly) to a goodly and well-composed Idifice, which consisteth of manie parts, different both in vse and sub∣stance; whereof some serue to su∣staine the waight of the Building, as Pillars, and such are the Nobility: Others, to containe or keepe the same in an vniformity, as Beames; and such may bee compared to the Magistracy: Others to defend and couer the frame, from the violence of outward iniuries, as Rafters and Postes, which may be referred to the Comminalty. Now, we doe ob∣serue, that as in all priuate Buildings that consisteth onely of these three parts, they cannot bee saide to bee perfect without other things for their finishings; whereof some are Ornaments, and serue but to beautifi; O∣thers for vse and necssity. Euen so, in the Publike Weale, besides the three aforesaide principall parts, there are required other seuerall Ad¦iuncts, which are to be eteemd and respected according to thr formall or necessary vses. Amogst the which (Right Honourable) this follow∣ing Treatise may hold one chiefe ranke (esecilly in these times) to con∣tinue it for occasion. It receyued birth from the lamentable experience

of the French Ciuill Warres, by that famous and renowned Chirurgean AMBROSE PARIE, cherished by diuers Kings of France: and ha∣uing bene gratefully accepted in most part of our Christian World, it doth now giue it selfe vnder your Lordshippes protection: put not into fine and Rhetoricall phrases, but into our home-spun English; such as best sui∣teth with this rough and boysterous subiect. Cncerning the worthinesse of the Author, or woorth of the worke, my testimony would rather de∣tract then adde. Onely thus much, that as amongst all humane sciences Physicke is the most excellent; and in Physicke, Chirurgerie is the most Authenticke and ancient; so this operation is of Chirurgery the most vr∣gent and necessary, or rather an Abstract of the whole Art of Chirur∣gerie.
Against Obiection, I haue your Lordshippes patronage for my defence, and therein I shall thinke my selfe as safe as in an Armour of proofe; knowing that it is a point of Greatnesse, as well to defend the weake, as to resist the strong.
