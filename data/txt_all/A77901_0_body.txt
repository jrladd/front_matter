Beloved,
IT hath pleased God, in his good∣ness & mercy, at the last, to ina∣ble your Servant to absolve the task imposed on him by very many of you, though not so soon as you ex∣pected, and himself desired, yet as soon as he was able, and the pressing duties of his Mini∣stry and Family would give him leave; had I been importuned (as many are) to print my Sermons upon any subject that I have treated of, I should have been ashamed to have been so slow; but its well known, nothing here published hath ever been the
 subject of my Preaching-labours; so that my frequent Preaching, did not onely interrupt and spend my time, but did also divert and place my thoughts upon matters Forein and Heterogeneal; yet I think if my ordinary Sermons were penned so exactly, and my stile so punctuall and elaborate, as many of my Brethrens be, I should have been more able and ready for the Press, but I have been ac∣customed to study matter, & take such words as offered themselves, and were suggested in the time of speaking: being therefore now for to compose, and think of every thing be∣fore I wrote, I found it heavier and harder than my Sermons ever were. These rubs have much retarded my ingaged service and en∣deavours to my Brethren, and the Church, and Cause of God, if happily it may be thought to be concerned in these lucubrations.
I have made bold to use the Plurall Num∣ber, because I designed to be your common mouth, vox & praeterea nihil, and to publish nothing but what I had ground to think was
 all your senses, as by many of the Writings received from you, I shall be able to demon∣strate, if required.
If any think, I have been light and lavish in illustrations, let them consider, this is my first piece, and hanging long upon the wheel, I was constrained to refresh my self with toyes and stories, which I thought might happily be a refection also unto others, and ease the tedium of a long discourse; yet I hope it hath not hindred light, nor any way impeached the strength and cleerness of the matter; what ever it is, I humbly offer it un∣to your worths, taking it as a great favour from God, and respect from you, that I was thought worthy to be accounted,

Northampton Decem. 17. 1655.
