NOt long since I published a litle methode intituled principles & inferences concer∣ning the visible Church: Wherin chiefly I purposed to manifest the true constitu∣tion of the Church, a matter of absolute necessitie & now so cleered by the wri∣tings of the late witnesses of Iesus Christ the auncient brethren of the seperation as that it seemeth nothing can further be added, The absolute necessitie of the true constitution appeareth, because if the Church be truly constituted & framed, ther is a true Church: the true spowse of Christ: if the Church be falsely constituted, ther is a false Church: & he is not the true spowse ef Christ: Herein therfor especially are those auncient bre∣thren to be honoured, that they have reduced the Church to the true Primitive & A∣postolique constitution which consisteth in these three things. 1. The true matter which are sayntes only. 2. The true forme which is the vniting of them together in the cove∣nant. 3. The true propertie which is communion in all the holy things, & the powre of the L. Iesus Christ, for the maintayning of that communion. To this blessed work of the L. wherin those auncient brethten have labored I know not what may more be added: I thincke rather ther can nothing be added: but now Antichrist is perfectly both disco∣vered & consumed in respect of the constitution by the evidence of the truth, which is the brightnes of Christs comming. Now al though they have also verie worthelie em∣ployed them selves in the Leitourgie, Ministerie, & Treasurie of the Church, both in dis∣covering the forgeries & corruptions which the man of syune had intermingled, & also in some good degree reducing them to ther primitive puritie wherin they weere by the Apostles left vnto the Churches: Yet wee are perswaded that herein Antichrist is not vtterlie eythet revealed or abolished, but that in a verie high degree he is exalted even in the true constituted Churches: In regard wherof, as also being enforced vppon some courgie & ministrie of the Church: The Ministerie I say consisting of the Presbytery & Deacons office, wherto apertyneth the Treasurie, & that for these ends: partly that the truth wee walk in may be manifested to the world, among whome our opinion and practise is so straungely & falsely traduced: partly that the differences betwixt vs & the auncienter brethren of the seperation may appeare, & therby men may be occasioned to trye the truth from error & to hold it fast. And although in this writing somthing ther is which overtwharteth my former judgmēt in some treatises by mee formerly published: Yet I would intreat the teader not to impute that as a fault vnto mee: rather it should be accounted a vertue to retract erroers: Know therfor that latter thoughs oft tymes are better then the former: & I do professe this (that no man account it straunge), that I will every day as my erroers shalbe dscovered confesse them & renounce them: For it is our covenant made with our God to forsake every evill way whither in opinion or practise that shalbe manifested vnto vs at any tyme: & therfor lett no man plead now, as some have formerly done, these men are inconstant: they would have they know not what: They will never be satisfied & the like: For wee professe even so much as they object: That wee are inconstant in erroer: that wee would have the truth, though in many particulars wee are ignorant of it: Wee will never be satisfied in endevoring to
reduce the worship and ministery of the Church, to the primitive Apostolique institu∣tion from which as yet it is so farr distant: VVherfor my earnest desire is, that my last writing may be taken as my present judgment & so farre forth as it overthwarteth any former writing of myne let it be accounted a voluntary retractation & vnseyned repē¦tance of my former errors & evil wayes before the whole earth. And lett no man bee of¦fended at vs for that wee differ from the auncient brethren of the seperation in the Leitourgie Presbyterie & Treasurie of the Church: for wee hold not our sayth at any mans pleasure or in respect of persons, neyther doe wee bynd our selves to walk accor¦ding to other mens lynes further then they walk in the truth: neyther lett the world think that wee approve them in all their practises: let them justifie their proceedinges or repēt of them: wee have (wee willingly & thankfully acknowledge) receaved much light of truth from their writinges for which mercy we alwayes blesse our God: & for which help wee alwayes shall honour them in the Lord and in the truth. But as Paull withstood Peter to his face & seperated from Barnabas that good man that was full of the holy ghost & of fayth, for just causses: So must they give vs leave to love the truth & honour the Lord more then any man or Church vppon earth. Now if any of the adversaries of vs both shall heerby take occasion of offence, thereby to speake evill, or to withold or revolt from the truth: let these men consider with themselves: First: that they even in that theyr Aegyptian daknesse wherein they walk have their most violent oppositions & deadly contentions: Agayne, the Apostle hath foretold that it is necessary their should bee dissentions even in the true Churches that they which are approved may bee knowne: besides the truth shall by our differences bee further cleeed, & theyr Antichristian worship & Ministery more & more detected, & cast into the bottomlesse pitt from whence it issued. Finally the Apostle saith that Christ is a stone to stumble at & a rock of offence to the disobedient aswell as a cheef corner stone elect & pretious to them that beleeve: & blessed are they that are not offended at Christ or his truth. So desyring the reader to weygh well what I plead & not to bee offended at the manifold quotations which are of necessty that by places compared together the truth which is a mystery may appeare & Antichristianisme which is the mystery of iniqui¦ty may bee discovered, I cease, commending him to the grace of God in Iesus Chist, who in due tyme will bring his people out of Aegypt & Babylon spiritually so called, though for a season they are there kept in Antichristian captivity & geevous spirituall slavery: which the Lord in his due tyme effect, Amen, Amen.
