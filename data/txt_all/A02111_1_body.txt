THe Athenians coūted such men vnworthie their Com∣mon wealth as were ingrat∣full: and Plato seeing an vnthankefull man prosper, said, see men of Greece the Gods are prooued vniust; for they haue laden a thistle with fruite. VVhen (right VVorshipfull) these reasons entred into my reach, and that I sawe how odious in elder time ingratefull men were to all estates and de∣grees; least I might be stained with such a hate∣full blemish, hauing receiued many friendly, nay fatherly fauours at your ands, I resolued to indeuour how I might shewe the depth of my affection towards your VVorship, I found my abilitie was not swerable to my desires to

proportionate equall requitall to your deserts, so that I onely thought to make thankes my pay mistris, and so passe ouer your good turne with the old prouerb, God and Saint Francis thank you. Yet when I perceiued great men had ta∣ken little gifts, I tooke heart at grasse, and im∣boldened my selfe to present you with a Pam∣phlet of my penning, called my Nunquam sera est: which your VVorship so gratefully accep∣ted, measuring my will more than the worth; that hauing made my second part, wherein is discoursed the sequell of Francescoes further fortunes, I thought to shrowde it vnder your patronage: I haue discouered herein the other follies of his youth, and how at last, repentance stroke in him such a remorse, that his sorrowe for his sinnes were more than the pleasures con∣ceipted in his vanities. I haue from the loue of a lasciuious Curtizan, brought him to the VVife of his youth: the storie necessarie for yong Gen∣tlemen, and not offensiue vnto graue eares: for the most seuere Stoick of all that seekes a knot in a rush, may herein finde some sentence woorth the marking. And though you as Virgill hold Ennius, yet you may out of his drosse gather

some golde. They which thinke there is no God to their Goddesse, may here finde that wanton loues are the readie paths to preiudice, and that effeminate follies are the efficient causes of dyre disparagement, and that there is no Iewel like the gift of an honest wife. But whatsoeuer it is, all is shrowded vnder your fauour: which ho∣ping you will as gratefullie patronage as the former, I wish your VVorship as ma∣nie good fortunes as your self can desire, or I imagine.
