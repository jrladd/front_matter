IT is not that I desire to be seen in Print, that was the cause of my writing of that which here doth follow, if otherwise, I might have been cleared. But thus it was, upon the sixth day of the weeke, being the seventh day of the ninth month 1656. there was a Lecture so called, at the Town of Austel in Cornwall, and as I lay upon my bed in the morning of the day aforesaid, the living power of the Lord did arise in
me, and a great burden fell upon me, and waiting in the fear of God, where the secrets of the Lord are known, it was laid upon me to go to the Steeple-house at the place afore∣said, and I knowing the terror of the Lord, durst not with∣stand nor consult, but gave up my self in obedience to the Lord, and to his protection, though I knew the people to be a wicked gainsaying rebellious people; yet I knew him who limits and sets bounds to the raging Sea, that it cannot passe its bounds, and my life being given up in the service and work of the Lord, not fearing what man could do unto me in the power and dread of the Lord, I went to the Town, and so into the Meeting-place, where were two of the professed Teachers, and in meekness and pa∣tience I waited (though under much burden of Spirit) untill the Priest had ended his confused, gathered in, ima∣gined stuffe: And afterward I standing up to speak, and to clear my Conscience and the Truth from his Lies, and other things spoken at that time by him, both the Priests began to pass away, and would not stay, though in the Name of the Lord I charged them to stay and answer, for I had some thing to speak unto them, but notwithstan∣ding all this, they would not stay, but went away, and left me amongst the rude and ungodly people, where, like rave∣ning wolves, they haled and punched both me and other of my friends that were there, that so it was I could not clear my Conscience, nor ease me of that burden which was laid upon me concerning them, though much was spoken at that time, but little received: after a little time without much harm, I and my friends came away. But my burden was not taken off, though some of my friends (seeing their rude∣ness) perswaded me to let them alone, and not to come any more amongst them. But on the first day of the week, af∣er our meeting was ended, I passed down to the Town with some friends, and having written to the Priest, after one Letter was burnt another was delivered to him, though at that time he would not read it, neither was very free to speak with me. Yet notwithstanding though there was little freedom, I passed to the Priests house, accompanied
with one of my friends; where (coming to the house) I found them very light and scoffing, and little freedom I had to clear the Truth, though much was spoken, it was but like water cast into the Sea. And after some little time I shaked off the dust of my feet, as a testimony against them, and came away.
But I was not eased of my burden, though I laboured to put it off, seeing I had been amongst them: but it lay still upon me, and I waited on the Lord, and on the second day of the week at night, lying on my Bed, I was comman∣ded to write, and so in obedience to the Lord I have writ∣ten what was given to me, which here is committed to the view of the world. Read with a single eye, and exa∣mine those Scriptures that I have set down both in the Margine and other places, and then try those men whom you have long looked upon to be Ministers of the Gospell, and you may see them both in Doctrine and practice to be contrary to the Ministers of God mentioned in Scrip∣ture, and in the steps of the false Prophets and false Apo∣stles, which the true Prophets of Christ and the Apostles testified against.
That which I have written it is not in envy to any of their persons; God is my record, it would rejoyce my heart that any one of them might turn from their wickedness, and unchristian practices, and cease deceiving and making Merchandize of poor Souls, and lay down their Crowns at the Feet of Jesus, and learn of him that their Souls might live; and though I be hated of them and others for my love in dealing plainly, not daring to speak peace to the wicked whom the Lord hath not spoken peace to, but freely declaring the Truth as it is in Jesus, owning the least appearance of Truth in any where ever I see it, and cherish it; but do witness against all hypocrisie and outside seeming holinesse and hyocriticall Professors, it is abomination to God, and the very prophane ones, and the Publicans shall enter the Kingdom before such.
I say, if I be hated for this my love in speaking and wri∣ting in plainness, not respecting any mans person, I have
peace with God in what I have here written, which I value much more than all the dearest love or greatest hatred and frowns of men. So I do admonish all who read this (or any other) not to be hasty to judge, nor to speake evill of things you know not, but receive in love what you can reach unto and see to be truth; and do not rashly censure that to be er∣ror which at present you do not well understand, but try all things, and hold fast that which is good.
From Tregangeeves in the Parish of Austell in the County of Cornwall the 15. day of the 9. month, called November. 1656.
