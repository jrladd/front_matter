WHere as of late (moste excel∣lent vertuous Quene) many goodly and proper treatyse / as well concernynge holye scripture / wherein is contey∣ned the onely comforte and consolaciō of all godlye people: as other prophane artes and sciences ryght necessary to be knowen & had in vse / haue ben by the paynefull dyligence of suche clarkes which haue embusyed them in the same very earnestlye and circumspect∣lye set forth in this oure wulgare Englysshe tunge / to the greate enrytchynge of our mo∣ther langage / and also the greate vtilite and profet of all people vsynge the same / and a∣monge all other thynges / oute of the noble scyence of Phisyke haue ben dyuers / proper / 
and profitable matters compyled and trans∣lated from the Laten tunge in to Englyshe / by the readynge of the whiche ryght manye haue confessed them selfes to haue receaued greate lyght and knowlege of such thynges in the which they haue founde no smal com¦forte and profet. And in this behalfe there is in the Laten speche a boke entytled / depar∣tu hominis: that is to saye / of the byrthe of mankynde / compyled by a famous doctor in Physycke / called Eucharius / the whiche he wrote in his owne mother tunge / that is be∣ynge a Germayn / in the Germayne speche / afterwarde by an other honest clarke / at the requeste and desyre of his frende transposed in to Laten: the whiche boke for the syngu∣lar vtilite and profete that ensueth vnto all such as rede it / and moste spetiallye vnto all women (for whose onely cause it was wryt∣ten) hathe bene sythe in the Doutche and Frenche speche set forthe and emprynted in greate nomber / so that there be fewe matro∣nes and women in that partes / but (yf they can rede) wyll haue this booke alwayes in readynesse: consyderynge then that the same commodite and profet whiche they in theyr
regyons do obtayne by enioyng of this lytle boke in theyr maternall langage / myght al∣so ensue vnto all womē in this noble realme of England / if it be set forth in the Englyshe speche / as concernynge this / I haue done my symple endeuoure for the loue of all wo∣manhode / and chieflye for the moste bounde seruyce / the whiche I owe vnto youre moste gracyous hyghnes to translate the same in∣to oure tunge. Moste humbly desyryng fyrst your graces hyghnes / and then consequent∣lye all noble ladyes and gentylwomen with other honeste matrones to accepte my pay∣nes and good wyll employd in the same: the whiche thynge as I doo not doubte for the woonte and incomperable benignite / good∣nes / and gentylnes inset & planted in youre graces nature / so shall it be no lyttell encour¦ragynge vnto me hereafter with farther de∣liberation and paynes to reuyse and ouerse the same agayne / and with much more dili∣gence / to set it forthe. For consyderynge the manyfolde / daylye / and imminente daun∣georus and parelles / the which all maner of women of what estate or degre so euer they be in theyr labor do sustayne and abyde: yea
many tymes with parell of theyr lyfe / of the whiche there be to many examples nedelesse here to be rehersed. I thought it shulde be a very charytable and laudable dede: yea and thankefullye to be accepted of all honorable & other honest matrons / yf this lyttell trea¦tyse so frutefull and profytable for the same purpose were made Englysh / so that by that meanes it myght be redde and vnderstande of them all / for as touchynge mydwyfes / as there be many of them ryght expert / diligēt / wyse / circumspecte / and tender aboute suche busynesse: so be there agayne manye mo full vndyscreate / vnreasonable / chorleshe / & farre to seke in suche thynges / the whiche sholde chieflye helpe and socoure the good women in theyr most paynefull labor and thronges. Throughe whose rudenesse and rasshenesse onely I doubte not / but that a greate nom∣ber are caste awaye and destroyed (the more petye.) For this cause and for the honor of almyghty god / and for the moste bounde ser¦uyce / the which I owe vnto your grace / most gracyous and vertuous Quene / I haue iud∣ged my labor & paynes in this behalfe ryght well bestowed / requyrynge all other women
of what estate so euer they be / whiche shall by readynge of the same fynde lyght and cō∣forte to yelde and render thankes vnto your moste gracyous hyghnes / wysshyng greate∣ly that it myght please all honeste & mother∣lye mydwyfes dylygently to reade and ouer¦se the same / of the which althoughe there be many / which do knowe muche more perad∣uenture / then is here expressed / yet am I sure in the readynge of it / theyr vnderstandynge shall be muche cleared and haue some what farther perceueraunce in the same. It is no small charge the which they take vpō them / for yf when anye straunge or peryllous case doth chanse / the mydwyfe be ignorant / or to seke in suche thynges which are to be had in remembraunce in that case / then is the par∣tie loste and vtterlye doth perysshe / for lacke of due knowledge requysite to be had in the mydwyfe. Wherfore I beseche almyghtye God / that this my symple industrye and la∣bor maye be throughe youre grace vnto the vtilite / wealth / and profet / of all Englysshe women / accordynge to my vtter and hartye desyre and entente / to whome also I daylye praye longe to preserue and prospere youre
moste gracyous hyghnes bothe to the con∣tynuall comforte & consolacion of our moste redoubted & withoute cōparyson moste excellent Christen Prynce / and also the ioye and gladnesse of all his louynge subiectes.
Amen.
