SIR,
I Heartily wish there were anything in this Poem that would countervail the Honour you would do me if you please to accept of it: I lay it at your Feet, with an humble Acknowledge∣ment of the many Favors you have done me; And as I am sensible this Return will not weigh down the least of 'em, so it should not be omitted if I were certain 'twou'd over-ballance the greatest. Tho' I am remov'd from you so far, and have not seen you for some Years, yet neither Distance nor Time shall make me forget how great a Friend you have been to me, nor fail to own it with all that due Respect that becomes me whenever I hear you mention'd. I never think of Ingratitude but with Detestation; certainly there is not a greater Sign of an ill Christian than unthankfulness to Bene∣factors: 'Tis true, there are some Men that falsly pretend to that Honorable Title; if they do a Kindness they will sometimes repent of it, which shews their Benevolence was only good Humor: Others will boast of it, and that proclaims theirs to be Ostentation: There are others that confine their Bounty to a single Person, a Pimp or a Parasite shall be plentifully reliev'd, and the poor Man that is just ready to perish shall be sent away with Curses; an Action quite con∣trary to the noble and diffusive Essence of Charity. 'Tis not, Sir, so with you; there never was a Man known so ready, upon all Oc∣casions,

to be serviceable to all sorts of Persons. Again, there are yet others that think they merit very highly by dropping some small pieces to the Poor, and they too come dribling from them as if their Charity had the Strangury: 'Tis better, indeed, to give little than not at all, but it is better to give nothing than to bestow it grudg∣ingly, for what Benefit can such pretend to from that Text of Scripture that says, God loves a cheerful Giver. In the mean time you are endeavouring to procure for Indigent Persons competent Subsistences for their Lives, which is relieving whole Families at once, and stretching your Charity to succeeding Generations. No Man that ever ask'd your Assistance wanted it, even though he had no pretence to it. That Importunity which others think is Impudence appears to you Necessity; and 'tis not to be doubted, but a Man de∣prest in his Circumstances says and does many things which he blushes at in private. You have yet another Benificence of Mind which is very much admir'd, and seems to have more Humanity in it than any thing I have mention'd; and that is, that even a Man's Faults makes not your Kindness the less active; in which, no doubt, you do excellently well: To forbear to do good to any Person because he is not so virtuous as he ought to be, gives us a just pretence to do no good at all, for no Man is without his Failings: To be kind to Me∣rit is so indispensably our Duty, that it leaves the less room for our Praises; on the other hand, to deal out our Kindnesses promiscuously, without regard to the Errors of some, or the blind-sides of others, is, in some proportion, to be like God himself; for we, by our Desert, have no pretence to his Favours, should he with-hold his Bounties from all that are bad, there would hardly be one good Man left to thank him for his Blessings.
From what has been said may be collected the Nobleness of your Temper; and indeed you have ever valu'd Virtue so much, and Riches so little, that were not this Address my Duty, it should have been my Choice: To whom could I more fitly make a Present of this Poem, than to him that needs not blush when he reads it? Had my Performance been equal to my Idea of the Subject, there had not one Knave or Fool gone unpunish'd: But however, I may have fail'd in the main Design, I have to say, in my Defence, that my Intentions were honest, and I beg you, Sir, to let that (for it has scarce any other Virtue,) recommend it to your Protection:

Though it may want that Spirit that should animate a Satyr, it wants not that Sincerity that should Influence a Christian, for I may safely swear to the Truth of every Article.
Having this Opportunity, I should here declare to the World those other Excellencies of yours that are so much the Admiration and Delight of it; that happy Pleasantness of Disposition, that habitual Liveliness and Delicacy of Conversation, that Reach and Sublimity of Judgement, that inexhaustable Variety and Newness of Wit, which has made you the Esteem of the First Rank of Nobility in the Kingdom, and rais'd you up even to an Intimacy with Princes; but this is what I shall forbear to insist on, because I will comply with your Modesty, and, indeed, with all things else that may shew I am,
Sir,
