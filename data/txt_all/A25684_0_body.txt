FInding you, dear Sons, who have thrô our means attain'd to the true knowledg of our first Mat∣ter, worthy to receive our farther Instru∣ctions in the remainder of the Process, to extirpate all such Ambiguities, as you may have conceiv'd in our Absence, to fa∣cilitate
your Labors, and to precaution you in the bringing your Work to its high∣est Perfection, We here, according to your desire, expose to you, and for your sakes, to the Public, all the most infalli∣ble Rules, necessary for preventing of Errors in this great Undertaking. And thô you, ever-honor'd Coadepts, could never yet so far prevail on your selves, as to come to a Resolution of presenting the World with the full Practice of this our Art, join'd to the Theory, we are ne∣vertheless most certain, that we shall not receive any Reprimand from you for bringing to light these our Rules, which we have so penn'd, that even those, who know not our Person, will not only soon perceive, that all, we have written, is the real Truth, clearly ex∣hibiting both the Theory and Practice of the whole Hermetic Art, but also conclude, that these Operations must of
necessity have very often pass'd thrô our own hands, from our giving such posi∣tive Rules, and infallible Instructions, elucidating all the most obscure and intri∣cate Enigms of the Philosophers, and war∣ning them of all the Accidents, that may happen in the working of our Subject: We are, we say, confident, you neither will, nor can blame us for this: since you will easily discern, that our De∣sign is purely to instruct our Disci∣ples, and prevent all the Well-wishers to this most noble Art from being im∣pos'd upon, and cheated, by any false pre∣tended Adept: to the end that those, who shall from the Divine Benignity, by the help of these our Aphorisms, or otherwise, have receiv'd the blessed knowledg of our first Matter, which is the very same in all our three ways of producing the grand Elixir, may thrô these our certain Rules obtain
the accomplishment of their Desires.
Having in our Travels fortun'd to meet with some Persons of true Principles in Philosophy and Religi∣on, we could not but embrace them, and instruct them towards its farther Perfection, which cannot be attai'd without the true knowledg of our Ce∣lestial Art, by which comprehending all the Mystery of Mysteries, we learn also how to serve God in Faith and Truth. And since we have no Ob∣ligation to any living Soul for the know∣ledg, we possess, having attain'd it all by the only Blessing of Almighty God on our Industry and Expences: be∣ing therefore at more liberty than those, who receive such a Favor from us, or some other Adept, 'tis our Deter∣mination, whenever we meet with Per∣sons so qualified, always to do the
same. Wherefore being at present in England, thô we are no Native of this Kingdom, we think it necessary to set forth these our Aphorisms in the English Tongue, not in the least doubting, but that the Knowing, mind∣ing only the Sense, will easily pardon any Impropriety, they may find in our Expressions: and when Providence shall carry us into any other Country, we, having attain'd to some competent knowledg of most European Langua∣ges, shall again take care to publish them in the Speech of the Place, where we shall be, that we may the sooner obtain the effect of our Desires, which aim at nothing, but the undeceiving of the World by setting down certain and evident Marks, distinguishing the Worthy from the Unworthy, and at the bringing of Men to leave their
unnecessary Forms, by instructing them in the true way of Serving God, be∣ing the only means to render them happy both in this World, and the next.
