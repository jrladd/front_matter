SCarron's a Fool, and Hudibras
He is, what is he? why an Ass.
And so's Leander's bawdy Poem,
And Maronides, if you know'um.
And other Folio's I ne'r saw,
Written by Lovers of ha-haw.
If but compar'd to what here comes,
I say, they are but meer Tom-thumbs!
And this I'm sure, though they're all vext,
You have kept closest to your Text;
And though they Somebodies would be,
They're Nothing, Nobody, to thee.


Dat. Scarron-ottonia, Anno Risûs inven∣ti, 5677.
