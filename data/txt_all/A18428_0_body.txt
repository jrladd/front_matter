To the right Honourable my singular good Lady and Mistresse, the La∣dy Margaret, Barronesse Dacre of the South, Iohn Chapman your poore seruaunt, wi∣sheth much increase of honor in this world, and eternall ioy and felici∣tie in the world to come.
RIght Honorable, my singular good Ladie and Mistresse,
whereas I find that ingratitude and forgetfulnesse of due reuerence to be performed of seruants toward Maisters & Mi∣stresses, is among all sorts most odi∣ous; as contrariwise, diligence to please, and reuerent dutifulnesse toward their sayd Maisters, &c. is in them a thing most laudable: as among many other, we reade of one Mucronius, ser∣uant afore time to a poore Artisan named Hargabus, who being afterward called to be a Senator, did still for euer yeeld such reuerēce vnto his said old poore Maister, as thereby he did not onely giue cause of great ioy, to Hargabus, but it was esteemed in him a great praise and increase of honour, to be so dutiful to him that had brought him vp. In regard whereof, I your Ladiships seruant, being desirous to make knowne to the world the obedient dutie & seruice∣able minde that I beare to your honor, haue thoght good (for want of better opportunitie, to present

your Ladiship with the education of the plotting and publishing of this miraculous worke of God, touching the straunge mouing of certaine ground, at VVestram in Kent, whereof, I with diuers others, haue bin witnesses. Humbly beseeching your good Ladiship, to accept this as a poore new yeares gift, at the handes of him, who prayeth vnto God that your honourable Ladiship may enioy many happy new yeares: and is, and alway will be ready and di∣ligent to please your Ladiship to the vttermost of his power.
