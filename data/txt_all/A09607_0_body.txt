I Custome did not enforce a Comple∣ment of Dedicati∣on; yet this Booke would de∣sire to insinuat into the affecti∣on of Ladyes and Gentle∣women; since it can arive at

no greater perfection of hap∣pinesse than your favour, which it most earnestly de∣sires. Let other workes co∣vet their Patrons and Mae∣cenasses, to derive from them a golden sprinkling of their bounty; whilst this shall ex∣presse an ingenuity beyond such vulgarintents, and in a brave and free manner sa∣crifice it selfe to your accep∣tance and service; desiring only that you would grace it

with the influence of your propitious smiles, which cary in them a secret power, not only to cherish and advance the object whereon they re∣flect, but also to endeare it in∣to others opinions, and make it precious in their estimati∣ons. Jn requitall of this your favour, it shall bee alwayes ready to furnish you with the best expressions of choise com∣plementall language, for though by nature and custom,

you can deliver your minds in a smooth and gracefull manner; yet from hence, without study, or praemedita∣tion, you may command ne∣cessary Ceremonies. Besides, your Ladyshippe's Chamber∣maids and waiting-Gentle∣women are to be pitied; who having by their good cariage compassed Suters, are often constrained to blush, in igno∣rance, for want of Comple∣ments, wherewith to answer

them. Let therefore this one instance, instead of more which might be inserted, per∣swade your intelligible, gene∣rous dispositions to receive this Booke once more as your devoted servant, and to ho∣nour it with your favour; which I shall esteeme as an exaltation to the supremest sublunary felicity, and the highest terrestriall happines.
