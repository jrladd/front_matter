Gentlemen,
I Was not ignorant when first I undertook this
task, and busied my self to compass this Work, how difficult it would prove to be in it self; what slender furtherances I had to accomplish the same; and how weak my own abilities were to give it perfection: Yet notwithstand∣ing all these obstacles, when I had duly consider'd the general want
there∣of, and the common benefit and advantage that would redound
thereby, especially to Merchants; I resolv'd to take the same in hand, and cheer∣fully and willingly laid both my hand to the
Work, and my shoulder to the burthen, collecting and gathering with laborious industry, and indust∣rious labour, all those principal points and heads, as might either con∣duce to the accomplishment of the Building, or any way further my in∣tended Fabrick: So that by my continual toil, and search after fit and apt materials, I hoped that at length a good issue would crown my endea∣vours, and finish this my intended undertaken task.
But after long and tedious inquisition, I found that the farther I sailed in this Ocean, the vaster were my desires, and the fewer were my further∣ances to my wished Port; so that perceiving the Work thus to increase up∣on me, beyond my expectation and first purpose, I was constrained (with the wind-scanted
Sea-man) to cast about again, and limit my self to a narrow scantling; for that to do it at large, and as the matter punctual∣ly required, was far beyond the reach of my knowledge; yet because I could not do as I would, I resolved to do as I could, and thereupon be∣gun again to cast these my first scatter'd Collections into a lesser mould, and reduce my first thoughts and observations into such a second limit and order, as might best befit my experience, and the compass to which now I had confin'd it; conceiving that as my intentions (joyn'd to my labour and pains herein) tended only to the good of others, and principally of
Merchants and their Factors, that reside or negotiate in Foreign Parts, so they will in requital be induced to have a good Opinion
thereof, as a re∣ward to me, for the benefit that shall redound to them by the same, excusing those errors which peradventure the better experienc'd may by tryal find in the perusal of this Work, and the defects which my ignorance hath in∣forc'd me to let pass, which by reason of the diversity and rarity of the matter the same is most subject unto, and the rather because I have been constrain'd oftentimes in this Desert to travel without a certain guide, and
not seldom to Navigate by anothers Compass, having not in any Language or Country met with any Author, that could either totally conduct me, or truly rectifie my steps when I went astray. Yet I must confess I met with some that shot at the mark I aimed at; but it was at random, and came not home to my purposed blank. Others I found who took up stuff upon trust; but at length I was further'd by some Friends, whose Star led me when I was benighted, and whose Candle lighted me, when other∣wise I should have stumbled; by which means, and my own Twelve Years Collections, during my abode and imployment in many parts of the World, I have at last by due sounding of the Channel, safely sailed over the
Ocean a∣fore-mentioned, and brought my Bark to an Anchor in
her desired Harbour; and I hope so well observed the Depths, Shoals, Rocks and Sands thereof, that he that Navigates after me, and by this my Map, shall be secured from all dangers, and thereby bring his accompts to that wished Port, that may prove both to his own Profit and Commodity.
Now, Gentlemen, having thus then understood with what Industry and Care the materials of this Edifice have been collected, what pains have been used to bring it to this conclusion and perfection, and having tru∣ly weighed the benefit arising
thereby; all these I suppose are effectual inducements to challenge a fair acceptance from you. Yet notwithstand∣ing all these real arguments I cannot deny, but the Work it self may not only suffer in the opinion of the censorious, but be also subject to the verdict of the judicious. But I am certain the foundation of it is laid upon the Knowledge of Geography, and the use of Maps and Sea-Cards in General: So delightful, profitable and necessary to the Mer∣chant, the study of which must not be neglected by any Person who would be esteem'd an expert Trader.
In raising our Structure; I describe, First the Empires, Kingdoms and Republicks of this habitable World; Next the particular Provinces of each; and then the most celebrated Towns of Traffick therein, together with their natural Products, Artificial Commodities and Manufactures.
Then I have given an Account of the several Coins there in use and cur∣rent, with the Value and Denomination of them, and the Species where∣in Merchants do there frame and regulate their Accompts by; also the Weights and Measures of those places, together with their Exchanges, and how those are found to be calculated amongst the Italians who are accounted the most expert Bankers and Exchangers in the World.
Lastly, I have added a Table of the Longitude and
Latitude of all these eminent Places of Traffick, not only thereby to satisfie the curious, but the better to guide the inquirer to any such City or Town sought for.
And, in all this Work my chief ambition hath been to please all Mer∣chants in general, and (if I may not be thought to judge too favourably of my own endeavours) I hope shall not fail therein. But I am almost confident, were my Labours duly weigh'd, my Work might challenge acceptance. However I offer it to the publick for their Benefit, and from the great Respect and Duty I owe to my native Country
England.
