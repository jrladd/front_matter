AS it hath been your Pleasure to accept of the Command of a Regiment of Foot, so it is your design to have it complete, for Officers, Men (and Arms) that they should be well disciplin'd in Military Art; and be∣ing commanded to serve you in the same, I thought it my duty to present to your view some Collections and other Observations in the Art Military, for the Exercise of the Foot: and I am confident of your Honours care to see what ever is, or may be amiss in your Re∣giment, to be completed, not only in the certainty
 of your men, but also for some certain days to be allotted over and above two or three days Musters, (that are only for the Muster-masters due,) for your Commanders to be impowred for to appoint some private Exercisings, for the better fitting and preparing of your souldiers for publick services: To which end I may presume to say, that what I have presented you with, is none of the least or worst parts of Military Order; which if it passeth my Countries acceptance, by your favourable countenancing of it, I may give it a Supplement to make it completer, not destroying my Title, as he who did supplement Mr Elton's complete Body: Yet I would not have the Eltonist take it a∣miss, that most of our Worthy Cruso's Works are Verbatim supplemented to his complete Body of Art Military to make it complete, &c.
Sir, I have not Embellished this with curiosity of Language, but rendered it for the meanest capa∣city, that none may be wanting in the Rudiments of Military Discipline; which diligently look'd into, will make the younger sons of Mars the better able to perform their Duty when ever his Majesty shall call for it. And now most Noble Sir, True Heir of Honour and Vertue; your Pardon for my bold∣ness, and your favourable construction of my weak endeavours, commands me to subscribe an obligement by the title of
SIR,
