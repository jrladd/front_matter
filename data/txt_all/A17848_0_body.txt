TEmples (saith the
auncient Aristides)
are to be dedicated to
the Gods, and Bookes
to Good-men. Vpon
warrant of which words, and long
experience of your goodnesse,
Right worshipfull, this silly, pit∣tifull,
and poore Treatise was once
vnaduisedly forward to haue bin
dedicated to your good worship.
But vpon more aduised conside∣ration,
whereas Aristides in his
wisdome knew nothing but that
which was good, to be seemly and
sortable for goodmen, & therfore
meant most certainly, that onely

good Bookes are to be dedicated
to good men: It recalled it selfe
in good tine, for that it cannot
challenge any such title either for
matter or manner of handling,
being only the rude rubble and
out-cast rubbis (as you know)
of a greater and more serious
worke. Whereas therefore nei∣ther
in respect of it selfe it dare,
neither in regarde of you it may
present it selfe by way of De∣dication,
for that should implie
honour vnto you, which it can∣not
bring, and require patronage
from you, which it needeth not,
beeing by the pittifull sillynesse
thereof secured from enuie, one∣lie
reaching at eminencie. I
heere sende it vnto you in lose
leaues, as fitt to be Ludibria venti:

and withall submit it to your
censure, not as he did Siue legi,
siue tegi iusseris. Albeit I assure
my selfe that you in your lear∣ned
iudgement cannot but sen∣tence
it, as I haue done with this
doome.
