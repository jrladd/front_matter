Dearly Beloved,
YOU are much upon my heart, and in my thoughts; I think my Self, yea Life well bestowed, if spent, or offered on your service and behalf; nothing will so much contribute to my joy, yea in a manner an addition to my Life, if ye stand faithful for God in this Day, and in the Trials you will meet withal. Oh my Friends, God Calls, His Servants Call, His Dispensation Calls, for you now to appear and stand up, like men for God; it's the desire of my soul that I may see your Faces with joy, in the day of ac∣count; and that will not be, unless I see your Faces, your Lives, with boldness and faithfulness for God.
Having some leisure since my enlargment from Jehovah's Furnace, in visiting some of the Lords People, I thought it needful to present this following Treatise to your use, you Heirs of Glory, born of a high Birth from above, des∣cended
from the Royal Race of Heaven, to you this Mite is given. Oh! me-thinks when I consider, what you are born to, what you are Heirs of, what a Father you have, what a Kingdom and Glory to receive, I cannot serve you too much, nor do enough for you.
And I hope in the sence of what God hath done for you, and your Interest in him, will draw you forth, yea be so prevalent upon your Spirits, that ye cannot do enough, or lose enough for him: Count nothing to dear to part with for him, no Ene∣mies so great, so potent, that can make you desert the Lord. My beloved, if you would be of such a spirit, as I treat of in this Epistle, you must set light by the things here, have all of that nature under your feet, you must die to the World, and have your Affections crucified to it.
So earnestly praying for your great Progress and pressing forward in the Work of your God, and withall affection desiring the great prosperity of your Inward man, with the once more Reviving, Flourishing state of Beauty and Glory of the Churches of Christ in these Nations: I rest,
