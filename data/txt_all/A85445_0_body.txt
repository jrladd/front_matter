MY LORD,
IT is not any high opinion that I have of my self, or these following Papers, that makes them ambiti∣ous of a Dedication, much lesse so high an one: but that which I have of your Lordship: Your great humility not to disdain the meanest pre∣sent, patience to attend the most impertinent ad∣dresse, and Justice to right the lowest person injured, all which virtues I seem at present to need, and your Lordship does more then seem alwayes really to have. Besides, my Lord, I carry a con∣stant reason for it within me, so great and particular an honour for your Lordship, that if I could do any thing worthy a handsome account, I must professe a resolution to expiate this fault by greater presumptions; not to give credit to what worth the world takes tice to be in you by my testimony, but rather to gain credit to my testimony from your worth; My Lord, There are more conside∣ that have created in me this confidence; The thing mane∣ this Controversie has fallen under your Lordships action, the te it self therefore craves your consideration; You are the per∣son imagined, given cut by some to be chiefliest reflected on by me in the Case of Transplantation: At your feet therefore I particu∣larly cast my self with this tender of Satisfaction. All come to you for Justice, I among the rest, whom you have often sent away with favour: My heart tels me I am innocent, and ever was in this

kinde, yet though I am innocent, I am not clear till absolved by your mouth; My Lord, I was happy once (and rejoyced in being so) for some little reputation which your own goodnes had given me with you, for I had nothing in my self to deserve it: But if I have nothing in my self to forfeit it neither, I beseech your Lordship that I may preserve it still, that it may preserve me still; Your good∣nesse has seldom denied me in my intercessions for others, I hope I shall not be only unhappy when I plead for my self; I doubt not but divers have taken the advantage of my absence as well as of my actions, to lessen your esteem of me: and 'tis not only that one thing of the Case of Transplantation, I hear they have misrepresented me in; I dare say it is misrepresentation, if any thing therein has displeased your Lordship, who can be no more offended with any thing that's just, then they can be pleas'd with any thing then what's otherwise: My Lord, it is your favour I crave, not theirs; before you to appear blamelesse, not them, which I shall never do whilest I oppose their interest and desires of Arbitrary Power, which I esteem my self bound in duty to do, whilest I have either power or interest, so far as it shall seem to me to oppose the Common∣wealths good. My Lord, There are some things in this Treatise less fit for your Excellencies view, but they are fit for Coll. Laurence, who hath sometimes drawn expressions from me I am not used to, by having always fastened characters upon me which were wont here∣tofore as little to be used to me: They are so frequent, and so grosse, that they might have gained some little credit with strangers who think bashfulnesse proceeds still from guilt, If I had not sometimes refuted them in as loud a style as he writ them; I likewise confesse, my Lord, his accusation of my reflecting on you, so much refle∣cted on me, that the anger of it lent my arm strength sometimes to strike hard; for he loudly cals me out to be his enemy that shall but whisper that I am not,
MY LORD,
