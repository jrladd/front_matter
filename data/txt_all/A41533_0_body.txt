Right Honourable,
YOur Excellent Name is not only in Lustre here, where the wisdome of a most intelligent and clear∣sighted
Prince hath chosen you to so great and near a Trust, to the perfect Content and Sa∣tisfaction of all sober and dis∣interessed Persons; But among Strangers, (those of the great∣est Power and Intimacy with their Princes) your Prudence and Conduct hath rendred you so conspicuous, that at Aix-la-Chapelle, and at Paris, they all gave you the happy Omen of being at your Return into Eng∣land, in no less a Station then that in which his Majesties Wis∣dome, and most Judicious Ele∣ction, hath placed you.

Your Goodness will therefore forgive me, at the least (and this nation will, I am confident, be far from reproaching me) that I assume a Liberty of ma∣king to you a Tender of the Productions of my Industry and Observation, in a Discourse of such Affairs, Negotiations, and Managements, as hold so near a proportion with the gran∣deur of your Spirit, and Eminen∣cy of your Charge.
The Republick of VENICE, as it is Ancient and Venerable, so it is Strong and Vigorous; as her frequent wrestlings with
Popes, Emperours, Kings of France and Spain, and other Potent Neighbours (in all which Encounters she hath come off with Honour) and most of all, her honourable struglings with the Ottoman Power can Testifie. And that she is Grave and Wise, let that one instance of many suffice, (viz.) her judicious untwisting that formidable League at Cam∣bray.
That this Wise Republick hath sometimes been seen in Troubles and Disorder, is no more to be wondred at, then that Clocks or Watches should be sometimes a∣miss;
not for any defect of Art, but by reason of the moisture or other intemperateness of wea∣ther: So here, the distemper of times, more then the default of Governours, hath sometimes pro∣duced disorders, though perhaps more rarely then in most Nations in Christendom.
Her Princes are the Sons of Nobles, instructed early in the Discipline and Concerns of their Country; And like true Heroes, have for almost a Thousand years protected this Virgin from the Rude Attaques of those He∣ctors and impetuous Assaillants,
that have at several times been attempting to violate her Ho∣nour.
It had been an unexcusable indecency for me to have made my present Address to a person of any other sort, then to one whose temper of mind, and known Abilities, were propor∣tionably formed to those great Affairs, which are the subject of the present Discourse: In whose person is united the Genius of so many of those Excellent Men, who in their several Ages were the Oracles and Generous Sup∣porters of their Country.

With these Impressions I se∣cure my self of Your Honours Candour and Condescention, and in all Humility, presume to sub∣scribe my self,
Right Honourable,
