Right Honourable.
LEt it not, I pray you, seem strange, that thus I vnite you in this Dedi∣cation: God him selfe hath gone before mee, vniting you in blood af∣finity and vertues; and I hope it's no offence to follow his example. The subiect of this worke is Piety; whereto as the world doth witnesse you All to bee adicted, deuo∣ting
your selues most re∣ligiously to God, in your owne persons, being pat∣ternes to others of it: so still to keepe burning that fire of Goodnesse, kindled in your hearts, & flaming in your liues, by the power of Gods Spirit shed abroad in your soules; accept of such helpes as heere you shall finde drawn out of the Scriptures, Gods Armorie, which if you please to vse, you shall
finde how potent they are in prosperitie to keepe you, in aduersi∣rie to comfort you, and in the day of the Lord to crowne you, through the mercy of God, with Happinesse and Eter∣nity: which Blessings, with All else, wishing to Euery One of you, desi∣ring the multiplying of All Graces in you, Ho∣nour, Health, Children, Life to his Glory, Sted∣fastnesse in the Faith,
comfort and ioy in the Holy Ghost, Patience, Wisedome, Hope and Perseuerance in All god lines to the end, and the quiet Peace of Consci∣ence at your end; I hum∣bly rest
 From my House at Gretford in Lin∣colnshire, May. 20. 1620.
