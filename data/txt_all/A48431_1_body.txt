SIR,
I Have alwaies, and that not without very just cause, esteemed it one of the choicest advantages that ever accrewed to me, that it was my hap, and happiness at my first setting out into the Study of the Scrip∣tures and Divinity, to be settled in the house, and to come under the tu∣torage and instructing of your Noble and Heroick Uncle Sir Rowland Cot∣ton; A Gentleman of so rare qualifications, and respondent worth, that (let the word be without offence) his Country and his times produced not a man beyond him, and I wish the Nation and succeeding times may shew his equal.
With much care, tenderness, and condescension did he guide and lead on my studies in the same way that he himself had been trained in, by that choice and incomparable Oracle of Learning Mr. Hugh Broughton: under whose instillings he had been so seasoned with skill in the Hebrew Tongue, and knowledge in the Scriptures, that even a Child he spake and under∣stood that language as it had been his Native, and in grown years he pro∣ved so exact, expedite, and solid a textualist, as few his equals.
He was alike transcendently singular in all accomplishments: His acti∣vity of body, experimented to be without its parallel in the Nation; His hospitality generous, unto the admiration of all that knew it; and his wisdom equally to be admired, that managed his estate so as to maintain such hospitality; His Patriotship even till now fragrant in the memory of his Country, whose heart he had, and it had his; His tenderness to his Tenants so fatherly, that before his death he took care that all their leases should be renewed, that they might be certainly provided for, when he was gone; His affection to, and his provision for his servants, may be ex∣emplary, as it was not ordinary; for in one morning a little before his end, he sealed nine or ten leases to them of handsom estates for their lives, and that so freely that he also paid liberally for their ingrossing; His acti∣vity of mind was sutable to the activity of his body, for he was a stranger to no kind of learning, singularly languaged both in the learned, and in the Western Tongues; and of so deep a judgment in all affairs, that there was hardly any concernment, occasion, or imploiment, in which he was not able to have given Counsel. And that which crowned all, so cordial and sincere was his integrity, virtuousness and piety, that a very few mi∣nutes before his expiring, he breathed out this fragrant testimony of a good conscience in my hearing, and to my great rejoycing, Lord thou knowest that I have loved honesty, virtue, and goodness for it self.
Sir, This radiant worth of your gallant Uncle, as it was an attractive of the affections of all that knew him (for he was a man wholly framed to de∣serve men and to gain hearts) so is it a most fair, beauteous and sublime pattern and copy set before you to write after: and I have spoken thus much the rather, not as if I would inform you of him what you knew not before, but because I know you delight to look upon his example, and to hear the sounding of his name and virtues, not only for his honor, but also for your own imitation of him. And daily may his example of

worth and nobleness provoke your emulation and striving after, that you may be his heir every way, namely of his virtues, as of his inheritance.
Besides this accomplisht bravery of his in himself, which was enough to challenge esteem from any one that knew what worth was; he laid such doubled and redoubled obligations upon me, by the tender affecti∣on, respect and favour that he shewed towards me, as have left so indeli∣ble an impression upon my heart, of honour to his dear name, and ob∣servance to his house of Bellaport, that length of time may not wear it out, nor distance of place ever cause me to forget it. I might relate particu∣lars of his kindness, but when I have said all I can, I shall speak too little.
As it is my rejoycing to have seen and heard what I have done, of your care to lay his Copy before you for your imitation, and your desire to tread in his steps, so have I cause to acknowledge with thankfulness, your writing after that Copy in your favours expressed towards me, even as he did before you.
And as I stand in an hereditary obligation to your Family for his sake, so have I found an hereditary affection from your self, which doth double my obligation, and pleadeth your claim also. It is my unhappiness that my tenuity is able to make no better a return for what I have received, than this poor paper Monument and Memorial, which I have presumed to devote to your name, and betake to your patronage, that you might have this token of my gratitude and observance laid up with you, and by the perusal of it, I might, though remote and out of sight, yet some∣time obtain the turning of your thoughts and remembrances towards
SIR,

Much-Mundon in Hertfordsh.
