SIR,
I Beg leave to present you with this short unpo∣lish'd
Satyr, not only for the Advantage of
your benign Patronage, but to gain an op∣portunity
of acknowledging the many Favors you
have been pleased to heap upon me; and partly
too as a kind of Bribe to beget your good Opinion
of it, knowing that what you but barely say you
like, is sufficient Reason to make the rest of Man∣kind
admire, believing it has past the Test of your
never failing Judgment. This I can assure you of
it, 'twas writ with a Loyal Heart, caused by an ut∣ter
Abhorrence and Detestation of the Villanous
Practises (brought to light by the discovery of
the late Horrid Conspiracy) of the ungovernable
Faction, who have lately and long Hector'd it in
this our Nation, and liv'd (and I fear still do) in
opposition to the Commands of the best Monarch
and best Government in the Universe. And now ac∣cording
to the method of our modern Scriblers, I
shou'd give you a kind of an Essay upon Satyr, and
Rail at the most considerable part of Mankind; but
I hope you will Excuse me, wanting Learning for

the one, and the Discontents of Old Age for the
other, scraps of Greek and the Fagg end of an
Old Latin Author will be wanting too; nor will
I give you one word of French to shew my Breed∣ing,
no nor so much as find any fault with the Poe∣tasters
of the time, to shew my Judgment; (though
the World has bin sufficiently of late Banter'd by
things of this Nature,) and all that I can say for
this, is, that 'tis new and all my own, and if you
are pleas'd to Judg favourably of it (and no Loyal
Man offended) I have both my Wish and my
Design,
