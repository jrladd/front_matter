I Can't tell why an Old Friend and Kinsman, shou'd not give a Man as good a Title to a Dedication, as a fine Coat, and a great Perriwig; Two Qualities, that of late, are thought as strictly Requisite in a Fashion∣able Patron, as a Clap, and a Duel, to the compleating a Gentleman.
And indeed, it's no wonder that our late Plays are so Barren, since we generally see our Authors reserve their Gall and Satyr, for their Dedications, where they seem to smile in the Patron's Face; and are civilly calling him Coxcomb, by a long Repetition of those Virtues, which Half the Town is heartily convinc'd, he is not the least Tainted with: And thus, (as Apelles displeas'd with his Painting an Horse's Foam, gave it the most height∣ning Touch, by throwing his Pensil at it in a Fury) these Gentlemen that are so very tame, and civil in their Satyr, are most Satyrical in their Panegyricks, and never so compleatly show a Fop, as when they are hardest at work upon the fine Gentleman.
Now, my end in sending you this Play with your Name to't, was purely to let pou see, that I still take a Pleasure in thinking of you, though at this Distance; and (if you find it worth a Room in

your Closet) that it might now and then, put you in Mind of the Author: Besides, I owe you many Thanks for your Care of my Brother, and wish I had a more effectual way of returning them; in the mean time, be pleas'd to take this Present in part of Payment; though I am apt to be∣lieve, shou'd I be ever Paying, I shall never be out of your Debt; for even your protection of this Trifle is running on fresh Score: For, whatever Fortune Xerxes may have found in Town, I knew your Name wou'd be the surest means to give him a Favourable Reception in the Country; and though the Ladies thereabouts shou'd think it but a dull Afternoons En∣tertainment in it Self; yet, if you happen to be by at the Reading, it will at least be diverting in the Consequence: For even Poetry can't make you Ill Company: They'll want no Musick between the Acts, having the Relief of your Conversation; and they must certainly be deeply in Love with something out of their reach, if that can't put 'em in Tune: For what Company, though never so dull'd, does not feel a new Life when you come into it, or is not Dead when you leave it? What Child, what Man, or (what's no little Wonder) what Woman is not pleas'd with you, which they are seldom known to be with any Man, that has so long forborn to Comple∣ment some one of their Sex with his Freedom? Yet so far you do Complement 'em too; Your not Mar∣rying, is more than a Probability, that you will never meet with an Occasion to have an Hearty Quarrel with any of them. Thus, with a little Expence of your Good Humour, you Purchase the Favour of that Sex, at the same time giving them Security, that you never

will be their Enemy, by Loving any one of them too well; if every ones Love be any step to Happiness, there wants but the 'tother Half of the Worlds know∣ing you, to make you the Happiest Man in it: While you are Master of such an Easie Fortune, no Wise-Man but must approve your Choice: You have Preserv'd your Liberty, and Tasted it; and how good a Friend soever you are to the Bottle, yet your worst of Ene∣mies can't but still own that your a Batchelor, and no Poet: You never yet were so far overtaken, that you either Married, or Writ Verses; which that you ne∣ver may, (without any Complement to the Ladies) is (while Yours) the Real Wish, of
SIR,
April 20th. 1699.
Your Oblig'd Friend and Kinsman,
C. CIBBER.
