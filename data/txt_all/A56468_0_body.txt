TWo principal Causes among others, (Right Honourable,) are wont to invite men to de∣dicate any Book or Treatise to a Person in Authority; The one, Private Duty and Obligation, the other, Publick Utility, in respect that the Master may concern that Person for the Common Good. And to confess the truth, both of these jointly have moved me at this time to present unto your Honour, above others, the two Books ensuing, which contain a Conference had in Holland not long since, out the Pretences and Pretenders to the Crown of Eng∣land, as your Honour shall perceive by the Preface of each Book, and therefore hereof I shall need say no more, but only declare the aforesaid two Causes of this Dedication.
First then I say, that my particular obligation to∣wards your Honours Person, riseth partly of good Turns and Benefits received by some Friends of mine at your Lordships hands, in your last Voyage and Exploits in France, but principally of far greater Favours receiv'd from your Noble Ancestors, I mean not only your Father whose untimely death was to England no small Wound, but of your Grand-father also, that worthy Knight, Sir Walter Deverux, who though he lived not to come to those Titles of Ho∣nour, whereunto he was born; yet left he behind him so rare a memory for his excellent Parts of Lear∣ning, Wit, Feature of Body, Courtesy, and other such Noble Commendations, as none in England perhaps the like in our time, wherein also hath lived your Honours Great Grandfather, Sir Henry Deverux Visconde Ferys well remembred yet by divers of my said Friends obliged unto him as also recorded by our English Histories, as well for his Merits and Wor∣thiness, as in like manner for his Match with the Heir of the most Famous and Noble House of the

Bourchers Earls of Essex,Polyd. in vita . VIII. whereof also your Honour is known to be descended, and to hold at this day, as well their Nobility of Blood, as Dignity of Title, and this shall serve in this place for my particular obli∣gation, whereof perhaps hereafter upon other occa∣sion I may give further relation and testimony to the World, in token of my Gratitude.
But for the second Point of Publick Ʋtility, I thought no man more fit than your Honour to de∣dicate these two Books unto, which treat of the Suc∣cession to the Crown of England, for that no man is in more high and eminent Place or Dignity at this day in our Realm, than your self, whether we re∣spect your Nobility, or Calling, or Favour with your Prince, or high Liking of the People, and conse∣quently no man like to have a greater part or sway in deciding of this great Affair, (when time shall come for that determination,) then your Honour, and those that will assist you, and are likest to fol∣low your Fame and Fortune:
And for that it is not convenient for your Honour to be unskilful in a matter which concerneth your Person and the whole Realm, so much as this doth, and finding this Conference had by two Learned Lawyers, to handle the Question very pithily and exactly, and yet with much Modesty, and without offence of any, and with particular affection and de∣votion to Her Majesty, and with special care of Her Safety: I thought not expedient to let it lie unpub∣lished, as also judged that no Hands were fitter to receive the same, nor any Protection more secure or plausible, than that of your Honour, whom God long preserve in all true Honour and Felicity to the Comfort of Your Lordships Faithful Servants and Clients, and to the Publick Benefit of your Coun∣trey: From my Chamber in Amsterdam this last of December. 1593.
