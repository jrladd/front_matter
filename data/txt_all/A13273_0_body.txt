GRaue Guides & Guards of Hopeful CHARLES his Wayn,
Least I incurr the least of Your Disdaigne;
If, without Leaue, I (ouer-rashly rude)
Vsurp Your Rooms, or on Your Rights intrude;
I humbly craue Your Licence; and Your Loues,
For My Address, When My Access behoves.
I know, the Field of His Yong HIGHnes heart
So duly till'd by Your deep Care and Art
(Adding His Fathers Royall golden Writt;
And goodly Practize, to demonstrate it:
His (late) rare Brother's Pattern, of Renowne:
With Honest Quin's new-cast Prince-Worthy Crown:
And holy Promptings of that reuerend Payre,
Milborn and Hakwill, from the sacred Chaire)
That little needs Hee the Stagyrian's store,
The Corduban's, or th' Attik-Muse his Lore:
Much lesse (alas!) My silly Muses Myte,
With borrowed Feathers to aduance his Flight.
Yet, sith, too-often, to a tender Eare,
Too-serious Lectures sound but too-severe;
Especially, to Princes dainty Taste,
They seem but harsh, and will not down in haste
(As holesom'st Dishes, if but homely drest,
Some queasie Stomachs hardly can digest):
Let me presume (with your good leaues) a while
To imitate Physicians honest Guile;
Who, oft, in Sugar sheathe their bitter Pills,
The better so to Cure vnwilling Ills,
When wayward Patients, for the Sugars sake,
Take-in their Health, which else they would not take,
Sad Rules of Patience, Abstinence, Austeritie,
Humility, Frugality, Sincerity,
Religion, Labour, Care of Common-Wealth,
And Manie, meet for Prince and Peoples Health;
Which hardly can, in their Owne Likenes, sinke
In Youth-ful Mindes (scarce in their Eares, I think)
How grauely oft, with greatest Diligence
Prest; and imprest with Tullian Eloquence:
Sweetly disguis'd, in artificiall Sutes,
Dancing the Measures after Delphian Lutes,
Washed in Nectar, wrapt in sugred Verse,
Enter more easily, and more deeply perce.
This I endevour: and to This Intent
I summon CHARLES to Vertues PARLAMENTâ–ª
