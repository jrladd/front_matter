Gentlemen,
I Heartily bless Almighty God for that Station, which, by his Provi∣dence, I have amongst you, where I have no need to rack my Invention to study Arguments of Perswasion, but ra∣ther proper terms of Praise: you gene∣rally doing of your duty, without giving me time or opportunity as your Minister, to recommend it to you.
This last Act of yours which occasion∣ed this ensuing discourse, which is now humbly presented to you, will, I doubt not, make you famous and eminent for your Piety and Zeal, throughout this great and populous City.

 That such a small number of Persons (as you are) should repair such an old, large, decay'd Church, at your own pro∣per cost and charges, without assistance from the Publick, must needs redound much unto your honour in the Eyes of your fellow-Citizens.
God Almighty grant, that this, and all your other Works of Charity and Religion, (which are many) may be re∣warded an hundred fold in this World, and in the World to come with Eternal Life.
This is, and shall be, the daily and hearty Prayer of
Gentlemen,
