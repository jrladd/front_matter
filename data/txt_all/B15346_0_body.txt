MY Lord, the League is a di∣sease as surely vnited to french mindes, as the feuer is vnto the corrupt humours of vnsound bodies: and in consideration hereof, I haue framed this dis∣course, wherein the remedie is more apparant then the disease it selfe, in case rebellious eyes wil vouchsafe to imparte it to their mindes, who ha∣uing digested the same, shall finde themselues cured & me satisfied: the rather if your selfe like hereof, aswell as you are deuoted to the kinges seruice. In hope wherof I shall pray vnto God (my Lord) to graunt vnto you his grace, & vn∣to me yours.
