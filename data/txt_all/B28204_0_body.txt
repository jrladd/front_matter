My Lord,
THere is not perhaps any one amongst all the Ancient Ethnick Philoso∣phers, whose Writings have met with a more general Applause, than those of Plutarch; neither has the Re∣putation, they have gain'd, been undeserv'd, For, whether we consider his Biography, in which the Lives of the Noblest Heroes, both of Greece and Rome are most exactly record∣ed, and most accurately compar'd; or, whether we regard those excellent Precepts of Morality and Vertue, admirably deliver'd in his other Treatises; we every where find somewhat so great and inimitable, that it plainly shews him to have wanted nothing, but the Knowledge of a purer Religion, to have render'd him one of the best, as well as the most learned Men of his Age. No won∣der therefore, if most Nations have desir'd to
 enjoy in their own Language the Works of so celebrated an Author: Wherefore, to gra∣tify those of our Country, who are no less ambitious of that Satisfaction than their Neighbours, several learned and ingenious Gentlemen have employ'd some part of their Time in cloathing him with an English Dress. His Lives were first taken in Hand, the Pub∣lication of which in five Volumes having been well accepted, it encourag'd the Undertak∣ing of his Morals; the Fifth and last Volume whereof being now compleated, I was re∣quested in the Name of all the Gentlemen, concern'd in it's Traduction, to lay it at Your Lordships Feet.
The complying with this Request, my Lord, I must ingeniously confess, I endea∣vor'd with no small Earnestness to avoid, the Consciousness of my Insufficiency, making me tremble at the very Thoughts of appear∣ing before so discerning a Judge; but when I found that no Excuses would be admitted, I, Coward-like, emboldned my self by the Consideration, that you are no less conspicuous for Goodness and Clemency, than for those many other singular Endowments, both na∣tural and acquir'd, which have deservedly rais'd your Lordship to so eminent a Dignity in the English Church and Nation.
Be pleas'd then, my Lord, favorably to ac∣cept this Tribute, paid to Your Vertues by
 the Translators of this Part of our Authors Works, and with your wonted Charity to pardon all such Errors and Imperfections, as Your well known Skill in all sorts of Lan∣guages cannot but find in the Version of a Writer, the hight of whose Conceptions, 'tis difficult, not to say impossible, to transfer into another Language, without very much abating their Spirit. The Patronage, You shall vouchsafe to afford these our Endeavors, as it will be a more than sufficient Protection against the Cavils and Calumnies of carping and malicious Critics, so will it lay a perpe∣tual Obligation on us to have a constant and grateful Remembrance of so signal a Benefit, in which none shall more faithfully persist, than he, who is, with all imaginable Respect and Submission,
My Lord,
