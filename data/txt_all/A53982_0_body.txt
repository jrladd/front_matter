My Lord,
COnsidering the long Happiness I have had at London, one While in your Neighbourhood, always in your Friendship, your Lordship will easily believe it is no little Comfort to me, that in this part of the Kingdom my Old Acquaintance is at last my Diocesan, and once again my Neigh∣bour.
Your Lordship knows, that (were there nothing else to be considered) my Affections to you are a sufficient Security for my Obedience to your Commands: And for that Reason, I presume, it was, that your Lordship hath been pleased to command me, first to preach your Visitation-Sermon, and now to publish it. The Veneration I have for your Character and Person, makes me ready to observe your Pleasure in all Particulars; though I must confess, that in Publishing this mean Dis∣course,
 I comply with your Lordship's Will with some Regret; because there are many Censorious and Ill-temper'd People in the World, who are ready to interpret that as an Accusation, which is only Advice; and to catch at any thing which may serve them as an Handle to strike at Clergy-men, though the thing be innocent in it self, and be intended to quite different Purposes. It is some Satis∣faction to me, that your Lordship is obliged, in some measure, to justifie me; and that the Faults which shall be discover'd in these Pa∣pers, you have now made your own, by coun∣tenancing of them, and making them appear by your own Directions. What Fortune so∣ever this Discourse shall find abroad, I hope you your self will be pleased to accept it this second Time, as some (though a small) Testi∣mony, that I am
 Petworth, Octob. 20 1692.
