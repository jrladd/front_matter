MY LORD,
WHen I was appointed to Preach before Your Lordship, I little imagined, That what was then delivered, would have ever receiv'd Your Lordships Orders to be made Pub∣lick. I am, my Lord, truly conscious to my self of the meanness of this Discourse;
but, instead of making Apologies, I here entirely resign my self to Your Lordship's Commands; which both shews my Obedi∣ence, and, at the same time, furnishes me with an excellent opportunity of tel∣ling the World with what a great Re∣spect and Duty I am,
My Lord,
