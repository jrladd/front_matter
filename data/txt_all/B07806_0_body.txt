RIght Honourable Sir, som∣times, a prety conceite well con∣uayed, contenteth the minde, no lesse then a graue & great booke. In euery written worke, two thinges bee specially required, Inuention, and Phrase: The one, is the substance or matter: the other, the forme or facion: but if they bee both good, they make the worke perfite, & win the worker commendacion. Yea, other∣whiles, a silly Subiet substantially hand∣led, is not onely passable, but also praise∣able. A litle flower well sauored is wor∣thy smelling: A trifling stone set hy a cun∣ning craftesman, deserueth to be worne: A poore Pamphlet perfitly handled, asketh the reading. J beseeche you then,
 giue leaue, and let mee present your Ho∣nor with this litle Dialogue, written by a Gentlemā, rather for pastime, then setled studdy: and yet in my poore minde, both for wise conceyt and pleasant penninge, worthy to be read. The Author therof (as a thinge vnworthy) is neither content it should presume to your presence, nor passe among the wise. Notwithstanding, without his leaue, I make bolde to aduen∣ture the one and the other: And doo most humbly dedicate the same to your Honor, the rather because he hath loued you long, and honoured you much. J craue small praise for my Printing of it, and hee (be∣inge vsed to loose his labour) desireth no∣thinge.
