BRight Starre of Beauty, fairest Faire aliue,
Rare president of peerelesse chastiry;
(In whom the Muses and the Graces striue,
VVhich shall possesse the chiefest part of thee:)
Oh let these simple lines accepted bee:
VVhich here I offer at thy sacred shrine:
Sacred, because sweete Beauty is diuine.


And though I cannot please each curious care,
With sugred Noates of heauenly Harmonie:
Yet if my loue shall to thy selfe appeare,
No other Muse I will inuoke but thee:
And if thou wilt my faire Thalia be,
He sing sweet Hymnes and praises to thy name,
In that cleaÌ„re Temple of eternall Fame.


But ah (alas) how can mine infant Muse
(That neuer heard of Helicon before)
Performe my promise past: when they refuse
Poore Shepheards Plaints? yet will I still adore
Thy sacred Name, although I write no more:
Yet hope I shall, if this accepted bee:
If not, in silence sleepe eternally.
