ALbeit (ryght honorable) that the prophecye of Ia∣cob was true / that the scri¦pture was not takē a wa∣ye from Iuda / vnto the tyme that Silo came / the very true Messias / both God and man. Yet dyd the almygtye GOD punish the Iewes wyth blyndnes / chefelye / for their Hipocrisye and Idolatrye / ande spoyled them of the moost holy ād right gouuer∣naunce. Where therfore it myght appere / that Antechrist was moost iustlie ād lau∣fullye extirped all together with his vsur¦ped power oute of this mooste fortunate realme and yet the same remained in dede still ī the tēple of god / with his abhomina¦ciō vnder the cloke of īnumerable straūge gods / which by his persuasiōs were dec∣ked ith pardōs, teples golde / siluer / pre¦cyousstones and other costlie thinges / to styrre there by the people / both to be ser∣uauntes vnto them / and to honour them / wherby (Christ beyng clene extīguisshed) myserably we haue iustifyed the Idola∣trye of the Iewes / that of iust cause the Turke (as the scourge of God) doth ther¦fore hate and persecute Christen men.
It hath pleased almightie god of his gre∣at mercy / to send vnto vs a Iosias / and a Kynge of moost worthye fame / clene to weede oute the same / commaundyng god and his holye woorde frelie to be geuē vn∣to all his louinge subiectes / and Christ o∣nelie truelie ande syncerelye to be taught ande redde euery where / the which is the very true keye / wherby to enter into the Kingdome of heauen / ande the nexte wa∣ye / to obteyne the mightie ande stronge swearde / for euer to beate downe the de∣uell and hys derelie beloued antechriste. For those trulie / did not receyue / with the Apostles / at the handes of the holighoost / the auctoritie of the keies of heauen / that teache theyr owne tradicions / ande not Chryst onelye / and the infinite mercy of God / And yet so moche hath been the cra∣king of the fayned vertues of the aboue∣named ennemy of God. Hys painted ke∣yeshaue bene so moche exalted / his colo∣red lyghtning / is so moche dredde in for∣raine Realmes (the more pitie) euen at this daye / that there by he maketh him sel∣fe not onelie the vicare of god vppō earth / but also a shamefull myxed thynge / set ād boasted vnto the woorlde / as a certeyne God of the earth / being both dradde ande honoured euen aboue God him selfe / and is in dede but a man of sinne / and the son∣ne of perditiō. To the intēt therfore / that thauctorite of his keyes / maye the better be knowen / I haue translated a sermon / declaring the true vse of the keyes of ab∣solution / whome the bisshoppe of Rome hath shamefully abused. Geuinge that for a token of my harte / vnto your good lor∣deshippe / that other by you (yf your plea¦sure so shalbe) maie haue the fruytion of so great a cōforte / to the maintenaunce of holie learninge. That the interest of his deceptfull iugglinge maye vtterly be bannyshed for euer. Ande thus Iesu pre∣serue your lordeshippes estate vnto gods honoure. Fare you well.
