IT May be by many iustly (most graci∣ous Soueraigne) imputed to me for no small presumption, to present to your Royall Maiestie, a Prince of so great learning and excellent iudgement, these simple fruits of my vnskilfull endeuours taken in this short abridgement. In most humble and obedient man∣ner, I do preferre vnto your Highnesse these my weake and vnlearned labours, according to my ability, which how vnworthy they be of so great a princely fauour, as wel for the meannesse of me the writer, as for the plain∣nesse and rudenesse of the stile, yet if for the worthi∣nesse of the matter, and of your Maiesties great accusto∣med clemency, vouchsafe then your Highnesse fauou∣rable regard, they shall be as fortunate, as if they had beene composed by greater & more learned men, where∣in briefly ay be seene, the great and infinite mercy of God towards your royall person, that it hath pleased his superexcellent wisedome by his mighty power to pre∣serue your Highnesse ancient Kingdome of Scotland, vnconquered vnder the Empire and gouernment of

one hundreth and sixe Kings, your Maiesties roy∣all progenitors: and in speciall when almost the whole world was brought vnder the Romane Empire by the sword. Also to reduce in one peaceable Monarch, these ancient mighty landes & many Ilands, which haue bene diuided in many seuerall Kingdomes, one of Britons se∣uen of Saxons, one of Scots, one of Pictes, one of Orkenay, and sixe of Ireland,: also some of the valiant and il∣lustre noble actes of your Highnesse most royall and an∣cient progenitors, and of their raignes, liues, deathes, and burials. Accept them most mightie Monarch, I most humbly beseech your royall Maiesty, in your High∣nesse gracious protection, and according to my boun∣den dutie incessantly with all humility, I will pray the great God of all might and power (to his eternall glory) long to preserue your Royall Maiestie, and your graci∣ous Queene in blessed health and peace, to raigne ouer these your Highnesse great vnited Kingdomes, and to enlarge the same, and your Maiesties most royall and hopefull posterity to the worlds end.
Your Maiesties most humble, and obedient Subiect,
IOHN MONIPENNY.
