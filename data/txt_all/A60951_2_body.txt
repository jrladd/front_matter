My Lord,
THough to prefix so great a Name to so mean a Piece, soems like enlarging the En∣trance of an house, that af∣fords no Reception: yet, since there is nothing can warrant the Pub∣lication of it, but what can also Command it; the Work must think of no other Patro∣nage, then the same that adorns, and protects its Author. Some indeed vouch great Names, because they think they deserve, but I, be∣cause I need such: and had I not more occa∣sion then many others, to see and converse with, your Lordships Candour and proneness to pardon, there is none had greater cause to dread your Judgment; and thereby in some
part I venture to commend my own. For all know, who know your Lordship, that in a Nobler respect, than either that of Govern∣ment, or Patronage, you represent and Head the best of Universities: and have Travelled over too many Nations, and Au∣thors, to encourage any one that understands himself, to appear an Author in your Hands: who seldome read any Books to inform your self, but only to countenance and credit them. But, my Lord, what is here Published, pre∣tends no Instruction, but only Homage; while it teaches many of the VVorld, it only de∣scribes your Lordship; VVho have made the ways of Labour and Vertu, of doing, and doing Good, your Business and your Recrea∣tion, your Meat and your Drink, and, I may add also, your Sleep. My Lord, the Subject here treated of, is of that Nature, that it would seem but a Chimera, and a bold Pa∣radox, did it not in the very Front carry an Instance to exemplifie it; and so by the De∣dication convince the VVorld, that the Dis∣course it self was not impracticable. For such ever was, and is, and will be the Temper
of the generality of mankind, that, while I send men for Pleasure, to Religion, I cannot but expect, that they will look upon me, as only having a mind to be pleasant with them my self; nor are men to be Worded into new Tempers, or Constitutions: and he that thinks, that any one can persuade, but He that made the VVorld, will find that he does not well understand it.
My Lord, I have obeyed your Command, for such must I account your Desire; and thereby Design, not so much the Publication of my Sermon, as of my Obedience: for, next to the Supream Pleasure described in the ensuing Discourse, I enjoy none greater, then in having any opportunity to declare myself,
