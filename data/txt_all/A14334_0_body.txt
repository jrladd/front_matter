IN the time of your ho∣norable gouernment in this Citty, it was my chance right worshipful to rime before you, and being more worthilie esteemed, then my de∣serts could merit, I did thinke it a point of my duty, to dedicate this worthlesse worke, onely to shew a kind of thankfulnes, assuring my selfe that since I receiued grace for extempore, this poore Inuention shall scape free from disgrace, hauing so worthy a Patron to defend it, Thus commending a ring posie rather then an Epistle I end, wishing your Worships endlesse felicity.
