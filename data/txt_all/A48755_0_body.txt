THere is none of you, that knows any thing of the
Protestants abroad, but hath heard of the fame
of M. JOHN DAILLE. Whose praise is so great
not only in the Reformed Churches of France, but in
this and other parts of the World, that I have some
hopes you may suffer your selves to be disabused, by
a Man of such Credit and Authority for learning and
piercing observation; for goodness and humility; for
modesty, humanity, and all sort of Vertues: and no
longer give any belief to what LEWIS du MOU∣LIN
hath written, or shall hereafter write against
this Church, or any member of it; when you see,
by the help of such a glorious light as M. DAILLE
was, what kind of man this L. du MOULIN is;
of how small judgment, fidelity, or care about what
he says; and of how great vanity, rashness and pas∣sion;

or rather rage and fury. Which render him so
unfit to be a Writer, that they quite blind his Eyes;
and will not let him understand any thing truly,
though never so clear in it self, if it be contrary to
his humour.
You will find this Character abundantly▪ made good
in what follows; which I have taken out of M. DA∣ILLE'S
Preface to his Vindication of his Apo∣logy
for two National Synods of France, Printed
at Amsterdam, 1657. Read it I beseech you pa∣tiently,
and consider it impartially till you come to the
end; where you will find Mr. BAXTER agreeing
with him in his Censure of LEWIS du MOULIN.
Who is not so considerable, that any of those learned
Divines whom he abuses should trouble themselves to
give him an Answer: but leave the World to judge
of him by this Impartial Character of M. DAILLE;
who sets him forth in his proper Colours.
