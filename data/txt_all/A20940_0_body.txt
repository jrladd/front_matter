MAdam, it may bee thought a double recompence in you, amongst many workes and many writers, if you would onely spare employments to peruse and giue (in charity) a milde opinion of this. But I (intending to your selfe a recompence, for late and earely loues vouch∣safed by your honourable Husband) dare honestly prefixe your name to this, and thinke it woorth

your patronage. When as indeede omnipotence it selfe cannot be well entituled to any thing but truth: then certainely it should be triumph, to defend a truth conuincing. And such a truth is now com∣mended to your fauor: which if it may acquit my zeale vnto your Knight and You, of thanks though not of satisfaction. For hauing thought your selfe most worthy to defend this truth, opposed by one of your own sexe, & almost of the same rank, I shall according to my wish esteeme it sutable to your person, whom with your honourable Husband, I doe now leaue to Heauens disposall; which may enable me to discharge a further duty.
