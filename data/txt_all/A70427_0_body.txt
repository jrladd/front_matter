To His Most Excellent MAJESTY WILLIAM III. By the Grace of God, King of Great Bri∣tain, France and Ire∣land, Defender of the Faith, &c.
May it please Your Majesty,
THE Kingdom of France, tho' never so large and pow∣rful, has formerly belong'd, either n part or in whole, to Your glorious Ancestors. The vast Dutchies of Normandy and Guyenn, Maine, Touraine, Perche and Poictou;
 the Counties of Ponthieu and Guis¦nes, Calais, Boulogne, Ardres  and their dependencies, were th Patrimonial Estates of the King of England; besides many Countie and Lordships that Your Predeces¦sors the Princes of Orange hav enjoy'd in Dauphine, Provence Languedoc and Burgundy;  that, tho the pretended Salick Law by which the Houses of Valois an Bourbon, endeavoured to main¦tain their usurpation, should tak place; Your Majesty has still th lawful claim of inheritance to th best part of the French Terri¦tories.
All the World knows that n such motives have ingaged You Majest in this present War: You generous Mind aims at nothing else than to get restor'd to your Allie what an ambitious Prince has usur¦ped from them. But as when So¦lomon prefer'd Wisdom to Riches

 and even the whole Kingdom beg∣gar'd and famish'd, sigh and long for such a Deliverer as Your Ma∣jesty, who is not afraid of the tem∣pests of the Sea, and bids defiance to the Fire of Canon's who has e∣ceiv'd so many Wounds, and loo'd so many Dangers in the Face for our Security. May Almighty God animate Your Subjects with so uch Zeal, and bless Your Arms with so great a Success, that Your Majesty may afford an occasion to Your se∣cret Friends to declare themselves, and procure them such a settled Wel∣fare, and constant Liberty, as may have no other end, but the Con∣summation of the World: Which is the earnest Desire, Of
