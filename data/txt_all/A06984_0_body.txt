I Will not Dedicate these weeping lines
Vnto a laughing Lord for Patronage,
That without Mourning habit richlyshines
In gold, nor will I send a Pilgrimage
My sorrowes, brought a bed in this same Booke,
To be protected by a Ladyes Looke.


Nor will I inuocate a Iudge, because
I write vpon an Honourable fate,
Vntimely hastned; for within his lawes,
Deathes immature are all degenerate,
He that condemneth life, and goods, shall be
No pittilesse protector (Booke) to thee.


No Sycophant shall see thee by my will,
No, nor a golden Coward, for I vow,
I hate his quaking qualitie as ill,
As any the worst vice that raigneth now;
A foole shall neuer thy sad lines behold,
Because Brasse is as good to him as Gold.


But I will send thee like a Marshall Booke,
Vnto all Souldiers, lac'd with noble skarres,
That thinkes on BVRGH with a deiected looke,
And that hath knowne him well in all his Warres,
That can repeate all things that he hath done;
Since the first minute that his sand did runne.


And that perhaps the glory of his worth,
His noble Birth, his seuerall Commands,
Will in a larger volumne blason foorth,
Then this that passeth through my feeble hands,
For to set foorth his rise, and not his fall,
Kirneld with life, and not with Funerall.


I could my selfe Heroicke stories make,
Of all the passages, of all his facts,
But that a mightie volume it would take,
And I should be so pleased with his Actes,
I should not halfe be sad enough, to write
His last fare well, my Heart would be too light.


And therefore I will vnto other braines,
Leaue the whole progresse of his former dayes;
Ile onely like an Eccho take the paines
To sing his end, and crowne his end with Bayes,
Which if I Miser-like too sparing doe,
Let euery Soule ioyne in my sorrow too.


And then shall Robert Markham be,
Most happie in his Ellegie.
