My Lords.
ALthough I know, the raw, untrained Reader, upon this last Answer above the rest, will be sure to pronounce his, Quis leget haec? and to bestow upon it, no other fate then thuris & scrombrorum; judging all things imper∣tinent, that lye not in the dirty troden way; or cold, which his torpid dullness is unable, at least too slothfull to strike any fire out of; and every thing to be destitute of a kernel, which is too hard for his delicate Gum to crack the shell of: however, I fear not the rendering my self faulty beyond Apology, in laying this Answer, above all the rest divulged in this present manual, at your Lordships feet.

My Lords, I know the admirable quality, and migh∣ty merits of the persons that think and have thought otherwise, then I have delivered my thoughts here; however I should have dealt faith∣lesly with my friend, if I should have returned him answer contrary to my judgment. And as I

have been morally true to him, so what right, or in∣jury I have herein done unto Philosophical truths in this nice, and hitherto inexplicable subtilty, none can better decide then your Lordships; at whose feet it is left, by
