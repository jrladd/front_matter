MADAM,
IF to comply with your Modesty were not to sin unpardonably against your other Vertues, whose infinite merit enforceth all persons to disobey you, by a professed admiration and acknowledgement of them, I should fear to own this Duty. But the offence being so general, and the Person against whom it is committed of so great a Goodness, I am the better encouraged to hope your Pardon for a zeal so inconsiderable, that the noise there∣of will be soon lost in the crowd and universal acclamations of your Admirers.
Amongst these, MADAM, you may behold those generous Persons upon whose Vertues Rome, the Empress of the World,

was Founded, suing to yours for Protection, which (if you please to hear them relate their misfortunes) I am confident your Chari∣ty will not deny, and they shall then confess themselves rewarded far above the merit of their unjust sufferings. It is not, MA∣DAM, that I dare wish these vacant hours should betray the least minute of yours to a loss; it will be happiness enough that you allow them to live under your Name, in whom all those scattered excellencies, which are here divided amongst many Persons, are u∣nited and perfected; for which there cannot be a greater veneration than that of
MADAM,
