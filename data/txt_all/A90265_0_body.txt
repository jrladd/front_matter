SIR:
HAving of late been deprived of the happinesse to see you,
I make bold to send to visite you; and because that the
times are troublesome, I have made choise of this mes∣senger:
who having obtained a license to passe, feares no
searching: he brings no newes (at least) to you, but that which was
from the beginning, and must continue unto the end, which you
have heard, and which (for some part thereof) you have practised
out of the word of God. He hath no secret messages prejudiciall to
the state of Church or Common-wealth; neither I hope, will he
entertain any such comments by the way▪ considering from whom he
comes, and to whom he goes; of whom, the one would disclaime him,
and the other punish him. Ambitious I am not of any entertainment
for these few sheetes, neither care much what successe they find in
their travel; setting them out meerly in my own defence, to be freed
from the continued solicitations of some honest judicious men, who
were acquainted with their contents: being nothing, but an houres
Country-discourse, resolved, from the ordinary pulpit method, into its
own principles: when I first thought of sending it to you, I made ful
account to use the benefit of the advantage, in recounting of, and re∣turning
thanks for some of those many undeserved favours which I
have received from you. But addressing my self to the performance,
I fainted in the very entrance; finding their score so large, that I
know not where to begin, neither should I know how to end: only one
I cannot suffer to lye hid in the croud, though other engagements
hindred me from embracing it, viz. your free proffer of an Ecclesia∣stical
preferment, then vacant, and in your donation. Yet truly all re∣ceived
courtesies, have no power to oblige me unto you, in compari∣son

of that abundant worth, which by experience I have found to be
dwelling in you. Twise by Gods providence, have I been with you,
when your County hath been in great danger to be ruined, once by
the horrid insurrection of a rude godlesse multitude; and againe, by
the invasion of a potent enemy, prevailing in the neighbor County;
at both which times, besides the generall calamity justly feared, par∣ticular
threatnings were daily brought unto you: under which sad
dispensations, I must crave leave to say (only to put you in mind of
your selfe, if it should please God againe to reduce you to the like
straights) that I never saw more resolved constancy, more cheerfull
unmoved Christian courage in any man. Such a valiant heart in a
weak body, such a directing head, where the hand was but feeble,
such unwearied endevours, under the pressures of a painful infirmi∣ty,
so well advised resolves in the midst of imminent danger, did I
then behold, as I know not where to parallel. Neither can I say lesse
in her kind of your vertuous Lady, whose known goodnesse to al, and
particular indulgences to me, make her (as she is in her self) very pre∣cious
in my thoughts and remembrance: whom having named, I de∣sire
to take the advantage thankfully to mention her worthy son, my
noble and very deare friend C. Westrow, whose judgement to discerne
the differences of these times, and his valour in prosecuting what he
is resolved to be just and lawfull, places him among the number of
those very few, to whom it is given to know aright the causes of
things, and vigorously to execute holy and laudible designes. But fur∣ther
of him I choose to say nothing, because if I would, I cannot but
say too little. Neither will longer detain you from the ensuing Dis∣course,
which I desire to commend to your favourable acceptance,
and with my hearty prayers, that the Lord would meet you and
yours in all those wayes of mercy and grace, which are necessary to
carry you along through all your engagements, untill you arrive at
the haven of everlasting glory, where you would be: I rest
