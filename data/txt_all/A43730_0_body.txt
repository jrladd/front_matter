SIR,
HAD not your desire (which I shall always look upon as Equiva∣lent to a Command, such have

been your repeated Favours) to have those unpolish'd Notes made Publick, delivered be∣fore you, (never calculated for the Press) overpersuaded me, no other Motive should have prevail'd. And for a Rea∣son of this my Resolution (once positively espous'd and deter∣min'd upon) I could tell the World, as others have done, (if I had that kindness for it) for my Inability, and draw up an Indictment against my own Imperfections; but these (if ever) will be too soon disco∣ver'd; and who will applaud that Mans discretion who should knowingly uncover his De∣fects before those who instead

of Pitty and Redress, would expose and deride 'em.
My Design, in the ensuing Tract, is Just and Honest; and the knowing Reader will con∣nive at, though he cannot commend the Method and Management of it. As for the censorious, who are commonly prejudic'd and disaffected (whose Bolts are soon Shot) as it hath never been my Practice either Publickly or Privately, to Claw and Curry their Factions hu∣mors; so I shall not be concern'd for their Disrespect.
One thing will recommend the Discourse to the Genera∣lity,

namely, its Brevity; which in a great Measure will com∣pensate for the coursness of the dress. I am,
SIR,
