RIght Worshipfull, vn∣derstanding how like Scilirus the Scythians fagot you are all so tied togither with the bro∣therly bond of amitie, that no diuision or dissention can depart you; In memorie of your rare and v∣nited loues (the like whereof this bar∣ren age scarsely affordeth any) and in regard you are three ornaments in this Honourable Citie, whereof I esteeme my selfe a member: To consecrate your vertues with my fame, I haue boldlie

made you the parons of this my worke, which both becommeth your grauities to read, and your deuotions to thinke vpon. Accept (I most humblie intreat you) this deseruing kindnesse from a gentleman, whose labours and curte∣sies being well construed, shall embol∣den him hereafter to aduenture on farre greater. Till when, I most humblie commend me: Written in hast, from my house at Low-Laiton, this 5. of Nouember. 1596.
