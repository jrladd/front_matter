Right Honourable,
IT is not the weight and excellency of what is here presented that may plead for so Noble a Patronage as your Lordships is: it is the Subject, not the Work; the Text, and not the Comment that deserves both your Prote∣ction and Perusal. For, my Lords, you have here Moses, that Grand Legislator of the Old Testament, dedicated to you that are the reverend Iudges under the New. His Laws have been the Magna Charta of the whole World; and this small Pentateuch hath proved the ground∣work for the Pandects of all Nations to build upon. In this respect there∣fore, it may claim a kind of propriety and right to your Honourable Pa∣tronage, and take the presumption to shelter it self under your grave long Robes. Here indeed are no Controversies stated, no Law-cases judged and determined: My Sole design and endeavours have been to make our great Law-giver Moses altogether Practical, and wholly applicable to

the Life and Conversation of Christians. In these sheets then you have de∣scribed those Antient Patriarcks of Gods Church, who were also Aecono∣mical Iudges, and so not unfitting guids for your Honours to follow, where their steps have been straight and upright; nay their very slips and devia∣tions may serve to make us stand more firm, and our treadings more stea∣dy and setled in the wayes of Godliness, and Iourny towards Heaven. But if your Lordships had rather walk by Rule than Example, here is that Moral everlasting Rule of God himself in the Book of Exodus to direct you: and withal that you may see how proper and convenient even a Ce∣remonial Law is for Gods Church, you have a whole Book of it in Leviti∣cus; and this also decreed and setled after those necessary Acts of the Ten Commandments: as if the very Moral Law it self had not been curb sufficient to keep in a Rebellious People without some binding Ceremonies. And here, my Lords, I must needs confess upon the sad experience of Schism under both Testaments; that all those Laws Moral and Ceremo∣nial have not been powerful enough to settle the Peace of Gods Church: something was wanting to the Jews, and is at this day to us, which under God is only able to produce that great and glorious Work; and that is a Ge∣neral Council. This General Council, my Lords, hath ever been the most approved successful way of the Catholick Church to compose her differen∣ces; and it is this also that will prevent the ruin of our own miserably devi∣ded National Church, and frustrate the design of that Politick Apho∣risme of some, that the Church of England must be ruin'd by the same way that it was reform'd; for (say they) it was reform'd by Schisme, and it must be ruin'd by Schisme. Now to prevent this ruine contrived by Secta∣ries, I know not any way more Prudential, more blessed by God, than a Ge∣neral Council; to procure this, that every Peaceful Christian (and such are your Honours) may joyn the strongest Forces of his Endeavours, shall be the daily Prayers of,
My Lords,
