MOst Courteous young Gentlemen, presu∣ming vpon your great Curtesie: I haue been so bolde as to present your estate, in token and wish of an happie new yeere, with these the first fruites of my poore Presse, finished since the cumming in of the same.
Surely, the traueill of a Gentleman whom I know not, no not so mutch as by name, much lesse by person: And concer∣ning the copie, as he that brought it vnto me made reporte, that it was translated out of the Italian, by a Gentleman, a freende of his, desiring me that it might be printed. And I be∣ing alwaies desirous to farther the studie, and procure the de∣lites of all men, by publishing bookes of semblable argument: thought good to dedicate the same vnto you, iudging it in this respect a present more meete for your moste flourishing degree: for that I perceiue it to haue beene first written by a Noble and g personage of Italy, and directed vnto his Ne∣phew, a young Gentlemā also of noble parentage, for the bet∣ter conforming of his behauiour at his entrace into the Court, as it may appeare by his Epistle hereafter following. Now for that this case is commō vnto most of you, and aboue all other the studie of ciuell Curtesie, most incident vnto your calling, I am the boer to craue your Courteous countenance, and friendly fauour in accepting the same now in English at my hands, as a testimonie of my seruiceable heart, and good mea∣ning towards you. And that receiuing it now frō me as your owne▪ you would vouchsafe of your great curtesie, to take both me and it in to your assured protection: and to defend both the present, and him that offereth it, from the spightfull toungues of malicious carpers. And in so dooing, you shall euermore binde me to emploie what traueill and seruice I can, to the ad∣uauncing and pleasuring of your most excellent degree.
Farewell in the Lord.
