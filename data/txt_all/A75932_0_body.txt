My Lords,
AFter the Felicity, my first labour, the transla∣tion of Virgil, receiv'd, in the protection of so Learn'd, and so Honou∣rable a Patron as your noble Father, my very good Lord, I could not, nor did resist, being charg'd home with Gratitude, Duty, and the Harmony

of Order, to intitle my Second Piece to the same renowned Family by this humble Dedication to your Lordships.
Nor is it, (may it please your Ho∣nours) without something of design, by which this my last work, what ere it be, may in such a Grove of Ho∣nour, with your Names inscrib'd, and influenc'd by your Vertues, last, untill the truest Test of Books shall sign its Commission for milder ages, and perhaps more cleer from Prejudice, Barbarity, and the most cruell of all enemies, Ignorance.
If any, my good Lords, shall ac∣cuse my Iudgement, and Choice, who had the Honour of Conversa∣tion with Virgil, that I have descen∣ded to Aesop, whose Apologs this day are read and familiar with

Children in their first Schools; and in these latter times dishonour'd by unworthie Translators; though the Dictates of my own reason denie I should make Answer to such men, It shall not be impertinent to say, this Antient Mythologist hath through all and the most learned Times, been highly esteem'd by the wisest, and studied to the great Advantage of Humane Life. Ma∣crobius, of most eminent Iudgement, allowd his Book a place in the Tem∣ple of Wisdome; and Socrates, who was judg'd by the Oracle the wisest man then living, follow'd him in all his waies of perswasive Ora∣tory, not disdaining to translate him into Verse.
But I fear I have troubled your Lordships with this Vindication,

and now be pleas'd to receive your own, the old Philosopher in a mo∣dern and Poeticall dresse; if he find entertainment from you, it shall be an honour to him, and the greatest engagement upon,
My Lords,
