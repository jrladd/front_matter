SIR,
THe fame of your Candor and Innocent∣Love to Learning, especially to that Musicall part of humane knowledge Poetry, and in particular to that which concernes the Stage and Scene (your selfe as I heare, having lately written a Tragedie) doth iustly change from me this Dedication. I had an early desire to congratulate your happy Retirement, but no Poeme could tempt mee with so faire a circumstance as this in the Title, wherein I take some delight to thinke (not without imitation of your selfe) who have ingeniously fancied such Elegant and ap∣poste names, for your owne Compositions, as Health's Sicknesse, The Vnlovelinesse of Love▪ lockes, &c.) how aptly I may present you at this time, with The Bird in a Cage. A Comedy, which wanteth I must confesse, much of that Ornament, which the Stage and Action le it, for it comprehending also another Play or Inter∣lude, personated by Ladies, I must referre to your imagi∣nation, The Musicke, the Songs, the Dancing, and o∣ther varieties, which I know would have pleas'd you infi∣nitely in the Presentment. I was the rather inclined to make this Oblation, that Posterity might read you a Pa∣tron to the Muses, and one that durst in such a Criticall Age▪ bind vp the Wounds which Ignorance had printed vpon it and the Professors: Proceed (Inimitable Mece∣nas)

and having such convenient leysure, and anindfati∣gable Pegasus, I meane your Prose (which scorneth the Roade of Common sence, and despiseth any Stile in his way) travell still in the pursuit of new discoveries, which you may publish if you please, in your next Booke of Digressions. If you doe not happen presently to convert the Organs, you may in time confue the Steeple, and bring every Parish to one Bell.—
This is all I have to say at this time, and my owne Oc∣casions not permitting my personall attendance, I have intreated a Gentleman to deliver this Testimonie of my Seruice, many faults have escaped the Presse, which your Iudgment will no sooner find, then your Mercie correct, by which you shall teach others a Charity to your owne Vo∣lumes, though they be all Errata. If you continue where you are, you will every day inlarge your fame, and beside the engagement of other Poets to Celebrate your Roman Constancie, in particular obliege the Tongue and Pene of your Devot Honourer,—
IAMES SHIRLEY.
