Gentlemen,
THough I had no intention
to make this Sermon Pub∣lick,
yet I could not with
any Modesty deny your Request,
when you had paid so great a re∣gard
to the Counsel given you in it.
I heartily Congratulate your hap∣py
agreement in the Choice of so
excellent a Person to succeed the
not-to-be-forgotten Dr. CALAMY,
who, I doubt not, will deserve all
that Honour and Kindness, which
it is so natural to you, to show to
your Ministers. I here present you
with the Sermon, as it was Preach∣ed,

excepting some few things at
the beginning, which were left out
in speaking, to shorten it, as much
as I could, without injuring the
Sense. I am sensible the Character
falls very short of what our decea∣sed
Friend deserved, but it is every
Word true, and I thought, had been
as inoffensive too as it is true; and
so I believe it will appear to wise and
considering men, and others may
judge as they please. If it will con∣tribute
any thing to make both Mi∣nisters
and People more faithful in
the discharge of their several Du∣ties,
I have what I aimed at, both in
Preaching and Printing it, especial∣ly
if you please to accept of it as a
Testimony of the sincere Respects of
GENTLEMEN,
