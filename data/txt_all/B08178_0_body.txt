SIR, the sacred scriptures, to which we must giue credit, (being the Adaequa∣tum obiec∣tum, Rom. 10. 17. perfect obiect of our faith, and the Epstle of that grand Creator of the World vnto vs his Creatures) ascribes the worke of Mans Redēption soly & wholly to the Rom. 3. 24. 5. 1. Cor. 1. 30. 2. Cor. 5. 19 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. Grace of God in Iesus Christ. Therefore they, that contradict & impugne this diuine, this inuiolable & inuincible truth, and seek to father their owne phantastique and base-begotten inuentions vpon the Scriptures, do (so much as in them lieth) extenuate the all-sufficient and inualu∣able mediation of Christ, they obscure the splendor of Gods grace, they dimi∣nish his mercie, they corrupt his word, they peruert his sentēce in it, & (as Lib. 1. ad∣uersus Hae∣reses, cap. 1 Ire∣naus saith in the like case) Transiliunt or∣dinē & seriē Scripturarū, ac (quantū in ip∣sis est) dissoluunt membra veritatis; as wil appeare by the discussion of those pla∣ces,

Dan. 4. Math. 25. Luk. 7. &c. that are vsually obiected, o fortifie that vn opnion of umane merits.
And that the grace of God may haue all the glor fm the creaure, that he, which iyeth, my Ier. . 24 2. Cor. 10. 17. reioyce in him; if wee bein with Christ our 1. Ioh. 2. 1. Advocate, Eph. 1. 4. in whome we were elected to t all life, and . Tim. 2. 6. Gal. 3. 13. Eph. 1 7. Heb. 9 1. 2. b whom wee were redeemed from eternal eath; t is euident that as hee was sent by God of his 1. Ioh. 4 10. vndeserued Ioh. 3. 16. loue nto he wr to aue vs, een so his Humanitie, (tat hee ight be fit to saue vs,) as assumed into the Luk. 1. 35. Ioh. 1. 1. 14. Math. 1. 23. vnitie of his person without dsion, and vnited Rom. 5. 8. to his Diuinity (mediate person) wi out cōfusion, his humane nature pe-deser∣uing no such aancement, as Inlib. 1. de Praed. Sāct. cap. 15. Austen teacheth. nde (enim hoc meruit? Quod eius bonum qualecun{que} praecessit? Quid e∣git anté, quid creddit, quid petiuit, vt ad hanc ineffabilm excellntiam perueniret? And that the same nature was also pro∣duced into nature without that hoerdi∣tarie disease of corrupted nature, it was from grace & grce alone. Ang. ibid. Néque nm Retributa st Christo illa generatio, sd Tributa, vt alienus ab omni obligatione
 peccati, de spiri & virgnaseretur.
And as o ouslues; we know that he was through the Act. 2. 23 determin recousel, and Heb. 2. 9. grace of God Rō. 4 25. deliuered to death for ur sins, and rose ag for or iusti∣fication. Fo Gd 2. Cor 5. 21. mde hm n for vs, that knew Christi du∣plex est con∣sidert o, va cdem decdū se altera e∣un u rs, quorum peronam instiut. Repctu priors, Chstus dicitur iu∣stus, sanctus, &c. Respec. n posterio∣is dicitur factus pec∣aum, rel. li. 2. Instit. not  (i him selfe) that we might be made the righteousnes of God in hm, which were vnrighteous in ourselues: For, beue he did represent our persons, as or Suerie therefore all our vnrighteousnes, (originall & actu∣all) was impued vnto him and hi righ∣tousnes both habituall and actuall was imputed vnto vs. L, the admrable mixture of iustice and mercie; of iustice, in that the Father would haue his Sonne to satisfie for vs, rater then our sinnes should escap vpunished: and of mer∣cie, because it psed him to impute the satisfaction of his Soe vnto vs, rather then wee sould perish n our sins. Ips Aug. in nc. cap. 41. peccatum, & nos usttia, n nostra, sed De in nobs, sed hoest, in Chsto. ipso: sicrt ipse pec∣catū, non s, sd nostrū: nec in se, sed in no∣bis: sc ergo ns istitia Dei in ipso, vtlle est peccatm in nobis; rēpe ximputatione.
 Finally, for our eternal life in the Luk. 16. 22. Io. 14. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 1. hea∣uens, where we shall obtain Re. 14. 13. & 21. 4. perfect & perpetuall redemption from all sinfull & earth Ps. 16. 12. Luk. 16. 25 Reu. 22. 5. miseries, together with a ful & final possession oy immortal ioyes; Humana híc Aug. in a cae some∣thing diffe∣rent, yet true in this, Lib. 1. de prae. deit. cap. 15 merita conticescant, quae pe∣rierunt per Adam: & regnet, quae regnat Dei gratia per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. For euerlasting life (as Paul af∣firmeth) is Charisma Dei: the gratious gift Rom. 6. 23. of God, in Iesus Christ our Lord.
The patient bearing of afflictions, and the performance of the works of pietie toward God, & of charty towards our Neighbour, without doubt are necessa∣ry, Necessitate presentiae, non efficientiae: be∣ing (as wee must needs confesse) Bernard. Via regni, non causa regnandi. For we are Eph. 2. 8. Act. 15. 11. saued by grace, and not by the Tt. 3 5. works of righteousnes, which we haue wrought, Quae Aug. ad Simph. Res. ad 2. quaet. gratiam non pariunt, sed quae gratia Gal. 5. 22. Eph. 2. 10. Phil 2 13. pariuntur. For as fre doth not heat, that it may be hot, but because it is hot: and as a wheel doth not run wel that it may be round: but because it is round: Sic nemo proptereà bene operatur, vt accipiat gratiam, sed quia accepit. And though saluation be

Eph. 2. 8. Fides salua non effici∣endo, sed af∣ficiend sie applicando. Officium fi∣dei, non me∣ritum prae∣pos. per no∣tat. h Aug. ib. Through faith Organicè, et it is not For faith Energeticè; seeig it is an instru∣ment onely, and no principall agent, or meritorious efficient. Ille h quippe nos fe∣cit credere in Christū, qui nobis fecit in quē credimus Christum: ille facit in hominibus principium fidei & perfectionē in Iesu, qui fecit hominem Heb. 12. 2. principem fidei & perfecto∣rem Iesum. Now it is absurd to thinke that faith can merit ane thing for vs with God, being Ioh. 6. 29. Rom. 12. 3. 1. Cor. 4. 7. giuen vs freely with∣out our merit by God. For the will of God id ouer all, subiect to no cause, to no cōmand, to no constraint. S habet Aug. li. 1. de Genesi contra Ma∣nich. cap. 2. cau∣sam voluntas Dei, est aliquid, quod antece∣dat voluntatem Dei, quod nefas est credere. By which it is apparent that the grace of God in Christ is all in all in that glorious and renowmned work of mās redēption.
By 1. Ioh. 4 9. grace we haue a Redeemer: by grace wee haue our Phil. 1. 29 faith in the Redee∣mer: by Rō. 3. 24. Tit. 7. 3. grace wee are iustified before the throne of diuine iustice: & by Luk. 12. 32. Ioh. 6. 40. 1. Ioh. 5. 11. grace we attaine to the 1. Pet. 1. 9 end of our faith, and the marke, wee shoote at, which is the saluation of our soules in heauen: where all our sobs shalbee turned into songs,
 our griees, into glory, our fights into triumphes, our crown of thornes no a crowne of glorie, and all omourning into cle all meldie, singing Allolu∣iah vnto the Lord or eer.
A frthe view of this heauenly doc∣trine, you may tk in this Tractate fol∣lowing, if you please to peruse it.
Which i you shall accept of, and not accout vnorthy of you, whome I haue accnted worthy of it, I haue my full desire, and as much as it doth deserue.
That God which 1 wet Gideons fleece with his dew, water it with a shewer of Iudg. 6. 38. his grace, and preserue you both in soule and body, to the full fruition of his glorie.
