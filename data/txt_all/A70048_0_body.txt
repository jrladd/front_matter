MADAM,
AS never any stranger was more ob∣liged than I, unto the King Your Majesties Father; so never any had greater desire than I, to make acknowledg∣ment of it to Your Majesty: But living in obscurity, retired from the Light of Court, and making no Figure there, I imagined it would have no Grace for such a Shaddow and Cypher as I, to present my self unto Your Majesty; and other presents I had none, but onely such as this, which by its Littleness, shews the Greatness of my desire to declare my self,
Madam,
