I Have sometimes perused, not without regret, that passage of the Historian, viz. Beneficia eo usque laeta sunt, dum videntur posse, solvi verum ubi multum ante venêre, pro gratiâ odium redditur. I must confesse my selfe conquered by accu∣mulated civilities from you, and mine own inability to make you the least recompense, for alas what are my endeavours? yet re∣ally not to belye mine own temper, I finde in my selfe an ambitious greadinesse, to im∣brace
all occasions, whereby I may ex∣presse my gratitude towards you; wit∣nesse this small Essay, whereunto I have took the boldnesse to prefixe your names, not to plead for my weaknesse, but to pa∣tronize my obedience, chusing rather to run the hazard of (perhaps deserved) censure, than not to make a publick ac∣knowledgement of my many and deep en∣gagements for your abundant favours. Ac pt (I beseech you) a thing born through the indulgence of Patronage, and in answer to your Commands, which I present as a testimony, how much greater my desires, than my abilities are to de∣serve the style of being
Gentlemen,
