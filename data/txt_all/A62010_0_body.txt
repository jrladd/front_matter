Sir, Madam,
THe Kings retyre∣ment hath given me a resurrection, and I appeare fear∣lesse, maugre all the threats of his and his Loyall Subjects enemies, in the dedication of these lines to your
 Patronage; assuring my selfe they will meet with the same welcome and reception in your Armes, which at first Your eares gave them; and Your munificent selves have ever given, to
Sir, Madam,
