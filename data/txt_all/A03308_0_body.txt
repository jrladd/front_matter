SIR, what, and how great my debt is to your Worship, it is very meet for me to remember, though it be not necessarie to acquaint the world with parti∣culars. My desire hath bene, and is, to giue some testimonie of thankefulnesse. Rich presents, such as in this crauing and catching age, do (as the Wiseman saith,Pro. 18.16. Enlarge a man, and leade him before great men, as you need not, so (I know) you expect not: sure I am, I for my part am very vnable to bestow. But (as S. Peter said to the cripple at the tem∣ple gate,Act. 3.6. Such as I haue I giue, euen a few blotted leaues; such perhaps, as in this itching-eared2. Tim. 4.3. ge∣neration, (wherin the most do more affect toyes then truth, and a flourish of words, rather then substance of matter) few will take notice of: yet such as I doubt not but you, out of your loue to me, but chiefly out of your affection to Gods holy truth, will vouchsafe kindly to accept. For me, to commend (as deceitfull hucksters do their wares) either to you or to others, that which I here make tender of, were to proclaime
 to the world mine owne vanitie. Let another man praise thee, and not thine ovvne mouth, saith the Scri∣pture: Pro. 27.2. neither yet will I any way disparage it: for that might be thought a secret begging of commenda∣tion. I submit it to triall, if either to your selfe, or to any other of the Israel of God,Gal. 6.16. it shall bring any li∣tle encrease, either of sound knowledge, or sweet fee∣ling in the mystery of Christ,Eph. 3.4. I haue my reward, and shall thinke my labour well bestowed. And so heartily, wishing the true good vnto your Worship, your good Ladie, your whole line and family, I take my leaue. Modbury in Deuon.
