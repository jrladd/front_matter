Right Honourable,
THe reason why I adven∣ture this Sermon to the publique view, is be∣cause I understand, it was, in the

delivery, mistaken by some hearers, whose second thoughts, I am confident, upon their bet∣ter scanning it, will bee more charitable: my whole scope be∣ing to perswade to an holy unity in Christ, which every sonne of peace wisheth with me▪ Our pre∣sent necessity may satisfie a con∣sidering man, why I put it under the Sanctuary of both your names, one being our Judge and inter∣preter of the Lawes, and the other one of the law-makers in the most honorable high court of Parlia∣ment: seeing wee now want both good lawes, & right interpretati∣on of the same, for the suppressing the disturbers of the Churches peace, and for the setling of an hap∣py

unity: to which I onely adde the hearty prayers for the good successe of your prudent endea∣vours and the humble tender of the love and service of

Dover,
Octob. 25. 1641.
