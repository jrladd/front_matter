Gentlemen,
THo' you have now had a pretty considerable Interval, viz. of near 35 Years, since the Chair has been fill'd by an Honourable Member of your on So∣ciety: However, your Fair Records keep a Long Roll of Honour among you, when you number no less than twenty Lord Mayors of your own.
But tho', 'tis true, the Collar of SS, that Honorary Ornament for a Year, has not so lately shined among you; however 'tis not so long since you have re∣ceived that Honour that will shine Ages, a more Lasting Monument of the Ha∣berdashers Glory: A Pile of that Illustrious Charity (Charity of all Honour the Brightest) that we need take but a very short Walk to see as fair a Structure for another Inscription of a Deo Dante dedit Robert Aske Armig. as that of Thomas Sutton; whilst a Hoxton Foundation may even bear Head, and write Sister with a Chartreux one.
But indeed 'tis not a single Glory of that kind that has thus shined among you. The Charitable Donation of Eighteen Thousand Pounds from one of your Mem∣bers in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth (a pretty round Sum in those early Days) deserves a very large Page in the Haberdashers Register of Fame. And really the Doners of Charity are the only Men (to say Truth) that pay their Debts before they die. They owe all their Riches to the Smiles of Heaven; and in the Provision for Fed Mouths and Cloath'd Backs, they pay it all Back to Heav'n again.
For one yet Additional Honour more to your Company, 'tis a Numerous one. So large a Body of you seems to say, you have some extraordinary Attractions of Worth and Honour to invite and draw so General a Conflux to you. And to make it yet larger still, we must consider you as a very spreading Root, when no less than the whole Foundation of so Eminent a Society as the Merchant Ad∣venturers were Originally a Branch of You.
Thus wishing You a daily Accumulation of new Honours to the Rich Portion you already possess, I am,
GENTLEMEN,
