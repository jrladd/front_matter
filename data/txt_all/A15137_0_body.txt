THE Law-enactors, whilst time fear'd the rod,
Faign'd in their lawes, the presence of a god,
Whose awful nod, & wisedome grave shold b
As hand and signet unto their decree▪
And such commanding aw that sacred name
Struck in the vulgar breasts, it teen'd a flame
Of Love and duty to their pious hefts.
Thus Rhadamanthus in his lawes invests
Him, whom prophaner times stil'd Heavens King▪
Minos and others strike the selfe-same string.
The Moral's mine: for in this quirking season
When pride and envie steere the Helme of reason▪
Itis, has with Presse-taskers been in use
To presse the issue of their prose and Muse
Vnder the Ensignes of some worthy Peere,
Whose very name unsatyr can a jeere,

And lock detraction up in beds of clay
To sleepe their suns as Reare-mice doe the day.
Then doe they bravely march with honour arm'd,
Which, as the gods, the people, charmeth, charm'd,
On this knowne priveledge feete I these lines,
In which, though dimmer then your native, shines
Your worth, en-fired by my kneed quill,
Which claimes the scale not of desertes, but wil,
In your acceptance and the worlds surmise
Then Cynicks barke and Critekes beame your eyes.
My quill's no pensill to emblason forth
Your stainlesse honour and your matchlesse worth,
As dust-borne flyes which 'bout the candle play
Glide throughits arch, en-circle, fan, survay,
Winke at the presence of dayes beamy blaze,
Pur on the glasse, or on hearb-pillowes laze,
Iust so my downy Muse in Distiques dare
Feete the perfection of a silklesse faire
Pumex each parr so trimly that her foe
Sweares her cheekes roses and her bosome snow,
Nay has strewd flowres of desertlesse prayse
T' adorne the Tombe of good Sr worthy Crayse,
Vnder this (ah mee) stone is laid (alas!)
A man,—a knight—the best that ever was
His prowesse war, his wisedome state did prove,
His kindnesse kindred, and the world his love.
But when shee should with her weake feathers soare
To court a star, or with her feeble oare
Strike such a sea of worth, ride honours ring.
Shee dares not touch, or snaffle, saile or wing,
Onely as he which limb'd those teares and sighs,
Which Iphigenias death, from hearts and eyes
Of kindred drew, but ore her father's brow
(Telling the world hee mourud without an how,)

Hee drew a vaile spake sorrow in excesse,
So with a—must my muse expresse
Your sacred worth, concluding it to bee
Too high for any Bard, if not, for mee,
Beside, the world of late has nicknam'd praise
Calls it an elbow-claw and scraping bayes,
Then pardon (Sir) this dearth, and iudge the why
Is your worth soar'd above Parnasse's eye
Let not your slights or nescio's (thogh most iust)
Condemne my muse to bee en-seild with dust,
Nor let presumption hyste to your embrace
But rather let your honour bate its place
And stoope unto my measures, since the name
Of Patrone awes oft times the breath of fame
And by this honour shall you ere en-gage
The knee, hand▪ duty, ayre and thriving age
