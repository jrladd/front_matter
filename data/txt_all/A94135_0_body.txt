Noble Sir,
IN the following Papers (which are but a Transla∣tion of Eight Propositions, as they were canvased by two learned Romane Ca∣tholiques) you will meet with some Primi∣tive Learning under the name of Ortho∣dox, and that will delight you; you will meet with some Moderne Learning under the name of Hetrodox, and that will not displease you: In both you will find the
 businesse of Secular and Ecclesiastique Po∣wer at full discussed, which will be no great burthen for you to reade; and a great hap∣pinesse to my selfe, that the world may therein see J am neither Popishly affected, nor ingratefully infected, since these lines walke under your Protection, (no friend to Popery, a great friend to Piety) and are Dedicated to you as a Tythe of that Gra∣titude, which is necessarily due from,
Sir,

London, Nov. 19. 1646.
