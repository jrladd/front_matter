NOble Sirs whom to can this part of Institution, having Vertue for chiefe Obiect, so rightly appertaine, as to either of you two, who are no lesse vertuous, then learned? VVhy then will some saie, should I ioine two so worthie Gentlemen in one so vnworthie a dedication? But why rather thinke they, that I should separate thē, who are no waies nearer vnited in kind, thē alwaies euer in kindnes? So if I were but to name the one, surely I should intend the other: but intending this dedi∣cation to two, I could not but name both. Adioine then, I exhorte you, these my meane practises vnto those good grounds of vertuous speculations yee haue both so happily laid, and continue in your study of Philosophy (as Cicero said in great commendation of Cato the second) non ita disputandi causâ, sed ita viuendi. In so doing you shall shine in vertue like the two Cherubims placed respe∣ctiue mutuallie on the top of the propitiatorie, and shall shew your selues not mere and ordinary agents, but that ye are worthy patternes propounded vnto others Imitation.
