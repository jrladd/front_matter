Go little Creature, in thy poor Attire,
And crave a Kiss at every Hand thou meets;
Although thou halt no Merit to admire,
Yet be the bolder tho' thou beggest i'th' Streets.
If th'ask, what art? bid them look in and see,
Then Ten to One but thou shalt welcome be.



As a Co-partner in your sad Complaints,
To hear the doleful Sighing of your Souls,
I truly sorrow, yea my Spirit saints,
To see you perish thro' the proud Controules
Of Faction; yet let this your Hopes maintain;
The Sun, tho' bid in Clouds, will shine again.



They stumble soon, that going, gaze on Stars;
Your lofty Flight doth predicate a Fall:
The sweetest Sins, when strain'd to th' highest Jars:
Heark, how swift, Vengeance croaks your Funeral.
Tho' Heaven hath seem'd to smile, and Time comply:
Your Doom is just, and you condemn'd to die.

Sæpe sinistra cava prædixit ab ilice cornix.
