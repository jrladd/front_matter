My LORD,
THE Actings of the Al∣mighty, in this last Age of the World, are visible to the eyes of all Persons in generall in these Nations, (especially to those that Love and Obey him) over whom Providence hath placed you as the chief Magistrate, in whose hands you have been an eminent Instrument, to bring to pass those things which he had determined so to be, and foretold by his Prophets, the Lord Je∣sus and his Apostles; which having in some

measure been discovered to some of His (de∣spised in this world) they durst not hide their Talent in a Napkin, but what was freely gi∣ven in to them, of knowledge & understand∣ing in things yet to be brought to passe, they doe as freely communicate to all, there being duties to be performed by all, and especially by those who have power in their hands to make good use of it, and their time, in im∣ploying of it so, as that This Gospel of the King∣dome may be Preached in all the World, and the Jews brought to their own Land, that so the Coming and Kingdom of the Lord Iesus to raign on the Earth with his Saints may be hastened; who knowes but that the time of deliverance to his People is nigh; the Lord grant that there may be no curfed Murmurers, or wick∣ed Transgressors among us, whereby that de∣liverance should yet be retarded a longer time, as it was with Israel for such Transgressions, who were deprived of the possession of the Land of Promise a long time, and wandred in the Wildernesses fourty yeares.
My Lord, the work is great that is to be done, and it will be done in a short time, if we put forth our Selves, Conquest and Liberty to preach the Gospel of the Kingdome go toge∣ther;

our eares have heard you have some de∣sign on the Western parts of the World, where these glad Tidings were never as yet made known; if Your Highness have any desire that the same should be there, or in any other part of the World published, you need not fear the Attempt.
At your spare time cast your Eye upon what this ushers to your view, and if the Lord have appointed you for the great work that is yet to be done, He will stirre up your heart to a speedy acting therein; to whom our Pray∣ers for your direction, and blessing therein, and protection over you (that under your Go∣vernment we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all Godliness and Honesty) shall not be wanting, in whom we desire to be found.
My Lord,
