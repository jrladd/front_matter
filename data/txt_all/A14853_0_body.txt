Right Worshipfull,
THIS petty Pamphlet (for so I may bet∣ter stile it, then a Trea∣tise) being so bold against the abuses of
the tongue, cannot but ex∣pect the criticall censure of many a Tongue. The Ma∣licious tongue wil defame it, the Scorners Tongue deride it, the Slanderous Tongue back-bite it, the Censorious Tongue will whip it, the Curious toung will hang, draw, & quarter it: Therefore it needeth a protecting Patronage, to giue some coūtenance vn∣to it, against those oppressi∣ons which it is likely to in∣curre by cōming vnder the Presse. And what fitter Pa∣tronage could it find then your two names? both which, for the Tongue, the
one in witty speech, the o∣ther in discreet silence, not my self alone, but diuers o∣thers also haue held in ad∣miration. Besides that, the neere affinity, wherewith, of late, by marriage, I am linked vnto your Family, and the many fauours vp∣on the same by you both vouchsafed vnto mee, do require this as a testimo∣nie of my gratefull re∣membrance of the same. I haue therefore presumed to Dedicate vnto you both, a as monumēt of my duty which I owe vnto you both, this poore present, humbly desiring a fauou∣rable
acceptance. Though it enrich not your coffers, yet it may your consci∣ence: for herein you shall finde (although vnpolish∣ed) both an Antidote a∣gainst a bad Tongue, and an Amulet for a good Tongue; how we may bri∣dle our owne, how wee may tame others Toungs. In many things wee sin all: And many times wee all sinne with this little mem∣ber, our vnruly Tongue. And what man liueth but is wronged by the tongue? Happy is that man who can auoide the strife of Tongues; happier he that
can set a watch before his owne tongue: A patterne for both these is here proposed. God blesse it, both to you both, and to all that reade it. And so humbly crauing pardō for this my boldnes, I cōmend you both to the Lord, and to the Word of his Grace, who is able to perfect that good worke which he hath begun in you.
