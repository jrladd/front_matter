My Lord,
THat the sincere practice of Christian Re∣ligion does very much tend to the peace and happiness of this lower World, I have in some measure represented in the following discourse. What ever other defects may be found in it, I am sure it proceeded foom a sincere in∣tention, and was designed to an excellent End. Nor can it be thought unseasonable to press men to Peace and good will at such a time as this. Ʋp∣on these Considerations I am very little Concer∣ned at the censures of angry and peevish men.
That I have made it publick is in me intirely an act of obedience. Nothing less than your Com∣mands should have prevailed with me to do that. If it should gain its End, as it would be matter of unspeakable joy to me, so I should have great
Cause to Bless the Holy name of God, who does great things by the most inconsiderable instru∣ments.
I am bold to prefix your Lordships name, and expose these following papers under your Patro∣nage: And shall not detain your Lordship any far∣ther than to tell you that I am
My Lord,
