Honoured and Dear Cousins,
THE Ancient Philosophers were wont not unfitly to compare the study and pursuit of Ingenious Arts and Sciences to the practise of Merchandizing; for as Merchants fear no Dangers, neither spare any Pains or Cost in travelling to foreign Countries, by Sea and Land, that they may procure and bring thence, to furnish their Store-houses, such

Goods and Commodities as they chiefly deal in. So those who make the attainment of Skill in the fore∣mentioned Liberal Arts their princi∣pal End, and the study thereof their Delight, are not deterred from pro∣secuting this Design, by any distan∣ces of Places, by Winter or Summer, fearing neither Rain nor Snow, nor the traversing of horrid Desarts, or the wild and roaring Seas, nor wa∣sting or weakening their Patrimonies, if at last they can but arrive at those places, where they may gain the ac∣quaintance and familiarity of emi∣nently-learned Masters, able to in∣struct them in those Arts and Scien∣ces, to the Knowledge and Compre∣hension whereof they aspire; or where they may inform themselves of the Constitutions and Customs of famous Nations, and of other things subservient to their Intentions. We have an Instance of this in the Wise Philosopher and famous Law-giver Solon, who (as Plutarch in the De∣scription

of his Life remarketh) tra∣velled through many foreign Coun∣tries, to acquire the knowledge of their Government and Polity, their Laws and Constitutions, in order to the qualifying and enabling himself to accomplish his design of giving Laws to his own. We read also in Diogenes Laertius, that Plato did tra∣vel to Megara, to visit Euclide; to Cyrene, to see Theodorus Mathemati∣cus; into Italy, to encounter the Pythagorean Philosophers; and also into Egypt, to converse with the Priests and Sages there, so mightily cried up in the World, and to ac∣quaint himself with their Learning and Mysteries: Moreover, that he intended a Journey into Asia, had he not been hinder'd by a War then newly commenced.
After the same manner Galen writes of himself, That he sailed to Lemnos, Cyprus, and Palestina of Syria, on purpose to see foreign Plants, and rare Oares and Minerals.
To relate what great Troubl and Dangers those that have written of Exotick Plants to this day have sustained and incurred in their foreign Peregrinations, would not be grievous to me, did I not fear that it would extend this Dedication to too dispro∣portionate and tedious a length; wherefore I will omit it, and briefly touch what concerns my self, mine own Inclinations to travel, and pro∣ceedings in pursuance thereof.
Although I dare not compare my self with those Excellent and Incom∣parable Persons newly mentioned, nor boast of any high Ʋnderstanding, Ex∣perience, or Learning, (so far as I know my self) yet to confess the Truth, I am forced to own, that from my Infancy I alwaies had a great desire to Travel into foreign parts, and to enquire out Learned and Fa∣mous Men, that I might get some∣thing of them to encrease my Stock of Knowledge. From whence it did proceed (I having chiefly before all

other Faculties, a great inclination to the Study of Physick, and finding that it required the assistance of a great many Sciences more, and espe∣cially Skill in Botanicks) that after serious and mature deliberation, with the Consent of my Parents and Re∣lations, and at their Expences, I did leave the German Universities, and travelled into France and Italy, where the Knowledge and Practise of Me∣dicine doth chiefly flourish, where also several rare Plants of great use in Physick, do naturally grow; to acquaint my self with which, and to gain the knowledge of them I have taken abundance of pains, and chie∣fly at Montpellier, where in company with the highly learned Jeremias Martius, Doctor of Physick, I wan∣der'd over several Hills and Valleys in many places, but chiefly the high Mountain Ceti, situate near Frontig∣nan, on the Sea-shore, &c. by which means I gathered several hundreds of Simples, and kept them by me as a Treasure.
But when I began to consult Au∣thors concerning them, finding a great many others, no less useful and advantageous in Physick, that were said to grow in Greece, Syria, and Arabia, &c. I was highly therewith pleased, chiefly when I found also those fruitful places of the Eastern Countries described, which several Authors, and above all the Holy Scriptures have mentioned; and from thence I was enflamed with a vehement desire to search out, and view such Plants growing sponta∣neously in their Native places, and propounded also to my self to ob∣serve the Life, Conversation, Cu∣stoms, Manners, and Religion of the Inhabitants of those Countries. And although I did not then imme∣diately put this my design in execu∣tion, but delay'd for several years, doing mean while what Service I could to my Native Country, yet I embraced the first opportunity that offer'd it self of accomplishing it:

For when my deceased Brother-in-law Mr. Melchior Manlich wished me to take a Voyage into the Eastern Coun∣tries, to find out their Drugs and Simples, and other things convenient and profitable for his Trade, and did promise me requisite Charges, and a considerable Salary, I immediately ac∣cepted his agreeable Offer, and rea∣dily embraced so often-desir'd an op∣portunity, and addressing my self in∣stantly to the Magistrates of this City (for I was then in their Service) cra∣ved Leave to go; which I had no sooner obtained, but I began my Tra∣vels into the Levant: What I saw, learned, and experienc'd, during the space of Three years, (for so much time this Journey took me up) not without great danger and trouble, I consigned all in good order, as it oc∣curred daily, in a Pocket-Journal, to keep as a Memorial of my Life.
But after I returned home again, being desir'd, nay, continually impor∣tun'd by several Gentlemen and others,

my very good Friends, to commu∣nicate this my Itinerary to them, and to make it publick. At last, after many Refusals, not being able any longer to resist their Solicitations, I was prevailed upon to comply with their Desires, to publish it in Print.
Wherefore I looked my Itinerary over again, and whatever Curiosities I had observed, I did transcribe into a peculiar Diary, which I divided in∣to three parts, according as I travel∣led into several Countries, and com∣mitted it to the Press, that I might communicate Copies thereof to my Friends.
It is not Vain-glory that hath prompted me to do this, but rather the Profit and Pleasure it may afford the Reader; that those who have no opportunity to visit foreign Coun∣tries, may have it before their Eyes, as a Map, to contemplate; and that others may be excited further to en∣quire into these things, and induced, by reading this Account, to Travel

themselves into those parts whereof I have written, to observe that more narrowly and exactly wherein I have been too short.
But if any shall object, and say, That I might have spared this Labour and Trouble, and employed it to bet∣ter purposes; and, that the present State, Condition, Situation, and Man∣ners of the World have been so ful∣ly surveyed and described by others, that there is hardly a corner of it left unsearched. To this I answer, That what others have written I have not transcribed into this Work, but what I have seen, experienc'd, observ'd and handl'd my self, is only mentioned here: But if any one hath already, out of the like Books printed before, lear∣ned all these things, so that nothing here propounded is new to him, I con∣fess this my Labour is of no use to such an one, neither have I written it for him. But he that by daily experi∣ence observeth how Wars, Plagues, Distempers, and other Accidents, may

and do mightily alter Kingdoms, Coun∣tries, Cities, and Towns, so that what was praised formerly as glorious and beautiful, lyeth now desolate and in Ashes, and what then was accounted barren and waste, may be now be∣come fruitful and glorious; he will confess, that still in our times a great many things remain to be search'd and enquir'd into, which others before us never did nor could observe, treat of, or publish. Pursuant to this the wise Solon before mentioned said, That he grew old, continually learning many things.
.
And Julian the Law-giver was wont to say, That if one of his Feet were in his Grave, yet he should be desirous to learn.
If this my Work doth not make or improve Divines, Lawyers, or Physi∣cians, (for which purpose I never in∣tended it) yet I hope some way or other it may be as well useful as plea∣sant

to them and others; for whoso∣ever shall read in this my Itinerary, how the glorious and strong City of Jerusalem is now ruin'd, and become a heap of Stones, and great Babylon laid in Ashes, and other famous places in like manner destroyed and desolate, the Land of Promise also changed in∣to a barren Ground, he may thence collect, that the Wrath of God is a consuming Fire, that he hath not only not spaed the Jews, his elect and pe∣culiar People, which he chose for his Inheritance, but also destroyed that once fruitful Land, flowing with Milk and Honey, which tho' it self did not sin, yet he hath cursed with Barren∣ness, for the Transgressions of its In∣habitants, Psal. 107.30. and turned the holy City into a desolation and solitude; the due consideration where∣of would be an effectual Motive to provoke Christians to amend their Lives and Manners; for, if this was done in the Green Tree, the chosen People of God, what will become of

the Dry, if once the wrath of the Lord be kindled.
Moreover, he that by this Book is instructed in the Manners, Customs, Laws and Orders of the People of the East, and what Tricks and Cunning they make use of, in time both of Peace and War, will know the better how to behave himself in all his Ne∣cessary Occasions of Traffick and Dealings with them.
Further, this Book also teacheth a Christian how to behave himself in his Slavery, (if it should befal him) to∣wards his Master, without any detri∣ment to his Soul or Conscience; and how by convenient means he may procure his Liberty again.
You may also see here how many Sects of Religions there are in these places, and how there are many good and well-disposed People, which are not far from the true knowledge of God, and might easily be brought to embrace the Orthodox Christianity.
I hope also that this my Work will not be very unacceptable to Apo∣thecaries and Physicians, containing Descriptions of many useful Herbs, of which I had willingly added the Cuts, but was forced to forbear at present, for several Reasons, not need∣ful here to be related, but I hope it may be done afterwards, when Time and Opportunity shall serve.
You will likewise find here several strange Stories, both pleasant to read, and which may give occasion to higher Considerations: So that I am in good hopes I shall not have taken all these Pains, and used this Diligence altoge∣ther in vain.
Now, Honoured Gentlemen and Cousins, to return to you; Sith it hath been always used by Writers, both ancient and modern, to dedicate their Books to some person or other, I also in compliance with this laudable Custom, have thought fit to dedicate this my Itinerary to you, not only be∣cause

of that Relation we stand in to each other, by reason of consanguinity, but also to acknowledge my Obligati∣ons, and declare my Gratitude for the many Favours, Good-turns, and Friendly Offices done me by Mr. Leon∣hart Christel, our dear Uncle of pious Memory (in whose Steps you Mr. Ni∣cholas Bemer, and Christopher Christel, the Heirs as well of his Virtues as his Estate, do tread) when he was alive, and do still at present receive of you three my Honoured Kinsmen; which my well-meaning Dedication I hope you will favourably accept, and own and acknowledge as your Cousin.
