GENTLEMEN,
MY Design, in preaching this Sermon, was pure∣ly to perswade you to injoy with Peace and Thankfulness, the inestimable Blessings which Divine Providence has secured to you, by this most Great and Won∣derful Revolution. And you, by re∣questing the Copy of it, have given me Assurance, I have obtain'd my Design; and that you will approve your selves

True and Faithful Subjects to their present Majesties. If any Reflections are thought to be made in the Sermon, they were intended only against the Ro∣man Priests, who go up and down in disguise to raise Discontent. I thought it my Duty to caution you, not to give an Ear to them. I further request you to pray, that God would strengthen the Thing he has wrought for us.
