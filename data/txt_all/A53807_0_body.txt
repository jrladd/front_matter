Madam,
I Give my self the Assurance to Dedicate this small Trifle to you, from the fre∣quent Injunctions you have for∣merly laid upon me, to do my self this honour: An Incou∣ragement, I must confess, too great for a Man of my Cha∣racter not to embrace, especial∣ly when he has your Promise in Advance, that whatsoever he dare commit to your Patronage,
you will raise up all the Power of your Vertue to secure from the rage and fury of malevolent Censors.
AND, did the World know to what Beauty and Soveraign Goodness I address this, I should have no need to fear their Malice, or be-speak their Fa∣vour: for, your charming Sex but looks, and conquers; and how many Potent Enemies so∣ever others may have to grap∣ple with, you need but once to make your Appearance, to see them all humbly silent at your Feet.
BEAƲTY is now the only Shroud to wrap a trembling
Writer in, and keep him safe from Blasts, and stormy Winds: It is like SACRED MAJE∣STY, to which all the World pays the Tribute of awful Reve∣rence and Devotion, and to whose absolute PREROGA∣TIVE Mankind owes its utmost Loyalty: So that it would seem no less than a Crime of highest TREASON, but to think of bringing its Power into Dispute and Question: Therefore, where That is once pleas'd to stand up in defence, who is so hardy to oppose, who so daring to break forth into Rebellion against it? That Man may then be bold in∣deed, who has Beauty's Ban∣ner to protect him.

BƲT, Madam, you do not place your chiefest value there; you consider Beauty as one of the perishable Goods of Time, and proportionable to that Sen∣timent you give it its estimati∣on: for you have more sublime Regards, inward Accomplish∣ments, and the Adornings of the Mind take up all your Contem∣plations. The Sphere of Ver∣tue is that you desire, and love to move in; and you would have that only to influence and actuate all your Principles. This is a Truth sufficiently known by all that have the ho∣nour to know you; and they will say, I have taken you but
in little, should I lay out my utmost Efforts to do you justice: and I would be glad to see the Person that is capable of draw∣ing you fully to the Life.
Madam, it were easie for me to expatiate upon the Theme of your Goodness; for I must give in my protest here, that I know nothing more Supreme: but I am sensible how much your humility will be offended at it, and, after all, that the Essay would appear but faint and hollow; and therefore, to save your blushes, and conceal my own weakness, I'll quit this Subject, and give you a short Account of that which you are next to read.

I met with it in French, and found it to be a true History of the Amours of a Lady of Qua∣lity of that Country; but be∣cause I perceived it did betray her frailty, and was too de∣tractive and derogatory from her honour, I have vail'd all their real Names under those of my own Constitution and Fancy; and I hope I have done no harm in exposing their Story, since I have carried it on all the way through a dis∣guise.
BƲT possibly it may be thought that I have done ex∣tremely amiss in making you this Present; for here is a La∣dy
whose Fate has been to have her Love predominant over her Vertue, and you make your Ver∣tue to be superiour to all things; so that how can you ever be a∣ble to appear in the defence of that, which by your Vertue you are so much obliged to dis∣approve? But I do not under∣stand, why, although one ought to have an Aversion for the Crime, one may not at the same time have a pity and compassion for the Person. Besides, to whom should the miserable, through their Fate, have re∣course, if not to those who at least-wise are able to give them the relief of their tenderness?
But, Madam, I can say more, if she was over come by her Love, it was after a very great Com∣bat of her Reason and Vertue; and that love of hers cost her her Life, and does she deserve to have no body stand up in her favour? I know your goodness so well, that it cannot but in∣gage you to afford your chari∣table supports to the frailty of the dead, and therefore with∣out any further trouble will leave her fatal Story to you; hoping you'll still honour me with your kind thoughts, and let me bear the Quality of,
Madam,
