ARachne hauing wouen in cloth of Ar∣ras, a Raine-bow of sundry stikes, it was obiected vnto hir by a Lady more captious then cunning, that in hir worke there wanted some coulours, for that in a Raine-bow there should bee all: Unto whom she replyed, if the coulours lacke thou lookest for, thou must imagine that they are on the other side of the cloth: For in the Skie wée canne discerne but one side of the Raine-bowe, and what couloures are in the other, sée wée cannot, gesse wée may.
In the like manner (Ladies and Gentle woemen) am I to shape an aunswere in the behalfe of Euphues, who framing diuers questions and quirkes of loue, if by some more curious then néedeth, it shall bée tolde him, that some sleightes are wanting, I must saye they are noted on the backside of the booke. When Venus is paynted, we can-not see hir backe, but hir face, so that all other thinges that are to be recounted in loue, Euphues thinketh them to hang at Venus backe in a budget, which bicause hée can-not sée, hée will not set downe.
These discourses I haue not clapt in a cluster, think∣ing with my selfe, that Ladies had rather be sprinck∣led with swéete water, then washed, so that I haue

solved them héere and there, lyke Strawberies, not in heapes, lyke Hoppes: knowing that you take more delight, to gather flowers one by one in a gar∣den, then to snatche them by handfulles from a Gar∣land.
It resteth Ladies, that you take the paines to reade it, but at such times, as you spend in playing with your little Dogges, and yet will I not pinch you of that pastime, for I am content that your Dogges lye in your laps, so Euphues may be in your hands, that when you shall be wearie in reading of the one, you may bée ready to sport with the other: or handle him as you doe your Iunckets, that when you can eate no more, you tye some in your napkin for children, for if you bée filled with the first part, put the seconde in your pocket for your wayting maydes: Euphues had rather lye shut in a Ladies casket, then open in a Schollers studie.
Yet after dinner, you may ouerlooke him to kéepe you from sléepe, or if you be hauie, to bring you a sléepe, for to worke vpon a full stomacke is against Phisike, and therefore better it were to holde Euphues in your hands, though you let him fall, when you be willing to winke, then to sowe in a clout, and pricke your fin∣gers, when you begin to nod.
What-soeuer hée hath written, it is not to flatter, for he neuer reaped anye rewarde by your sexe, but repentaunce, neither canne it be to mocke you, for he neuer knewe any thing by your sexe but righteous∣nesse.
But I feare no anger for saying well, when there is none, but thinketh she deserueth better.
She that hath no glasse to dresse hir heade, will vse a hole of water, shée that wanteth a sléeke-stone to smooth hir linnen, will take a pebble: the country dame girdeth hir selfe as straight in the wast with a course

caddis, as the Madame of the court with a silke ri∣band, so that séeing euerye one so willing to be pran∣ked, I could not thinke any one vnwilling to be pray∣sed.
One hand washeth another, but they both wash the face, one foote goeth by an other, but they both carrye the body, Euphues and Philautus praise one an other, but they both extoll women: Therefore in my minde you are more beholding to Gentlemen that make the coulours, then to the Painters, that drawe your coun∣terfaites: for that Appelles cunning is nothing if hée paint with water, and the beautie of women not much if they go vnpraised.
If you thinke this loue dreamed, not done, yet mée thinketh you may as well like that loue which is penned and not practised, as that flower that is wrought with the néedle, and groweth not by nature, the one you weare in your heades, for the faire sight, though it haue no sauour, the other you may reade for to passe the time, though it bring small pastime.
You chuse cloth that will weare whitest, not that will last longest, coulours that looke freshest, not that endure soundest, and I woulde you would reade bookes that haue more shew of pleasure, then ground of profit, then should Euphues be as often in your hands, being but a toy, as Lawne on your heads, being but trash, the one will be scarse liked after once reading, and the other is worne out after the first washing.
There is nothing lighter then a feather, yet is it sette a loft in a woemans hatte, nothing sligh∣ter then haire, yet is it most frilled in a Ladies heade, so that I am in good hope, though their be no∣thing of lesse accounte then Euphues, yet hee shall be marked with Ladyes eyes, and lyked somtimes in

their eares: For this I haue diligently obserued, that there shall be nothing founde, that may offend the rhast minde with vnseemely tearmes, or vncleanely talke.
Then Ladies I commit my selfe to your curtesies, trauing this onely, that hauing read, you conceale your censure, writing your iudgments as you doe the posies in your rings, which are alwayes next to the finger, not to be seene of him that holdeth you by the handes, and yet knowne to you that wear them on your hands: If you bée wrunge (whiche can-not be done with-out wrong) it were better to cut the shooe, then burne the last.
If a Tailour make your gowne too little, you couer his fault with a broad stomacher, if too great, with a number of plights, if too short, with a faire garde, if to long, with a false gathering, my trust is you will deale in the like manner with Euphues, that if he haue not fead your humour, yet you will excuse him more then the Tailour: for could Euphues take the measure of a womans minde, as the Tailour doth of hir bodye, hée would go as néere to fit them for a fancie, as the other doth for a fashion.
Hée that weighes wind, must haue a steadie hand to holde the ballaunce, and he that sercheth a woemans thoughts must haue his own stayed. But least I make my Epistle as you do your new-found bracelets, end∣lesse, I will frame it like a bullet, which is no sooner in the mould but it is made. Committing your Ladiships to the Almightie, who graunt you al you woulde haue, and shoulde haue: so your wishes stand with his will. And so humbly I bid you farewell.
