I Would not haue you to take me for a Bawd, or a Pander, for that I send a Whore
amongst you, for though it be my pleasure to call her so, yet you in perusing of
beyond conuersing with her, shall finde her honester then some of your Wiues or
Mothers. Indeed she hath no great Kindred to boast of, for my poore braine,
like loue, was father and mother that begat and bare her, like a new Pallas; and my pe

the Midwife that first wrap'd her in ragged verses in stead of clouts, where the Printer hath
'd her as he would be loth to be vs'd himselfe; for hee hath published and proclaimed all
er faults to the view of the world, and yet I know the poore Whores paines is not past,
for now shee is to be examined a thousand wayes, and tortured vpon the Racke of Censure,
and amongst all that shall view and handle her, the hot Whoremaster will deale most dis∣courteously
with her, for when hee perceiues her honestie too hard for his knauery, hee will in
ger, with three tushes, foure pishes, fiue mewes, sixe wry mouthes, and seuen scur∣
faces, teare her and pull her worse then the rusticall Rabblement did vse to vse com∣mon
Whores on former Shroue-Tuesdayes. But all's one, let him due his worst, shee is
confidently arm'd with Innocency; and the threats or danger of the bad cannot affright
er, but that shee will attempt to recreate the good. In a word, all that is amisse in
ir, I pray you impute it to my bad Tutorship, and her owne frailtie; all that I hope of
er is, that shee is a merrie Whore, full of good words, A kinde Whore to be bad for
oney or loue any where; a true Whore and a constant, for shee will neuer for sake any man
that will keepe her; and (by reason shee is an honest Whore) shee is a poore Whore, and hath
either money nor Sprats; so take my VVhore amongst you as she is.

Now after this, I'l bee exceeding briefe
To send another Pamphlet call'd a Thiefe;
The Hue and Cry is out, and I protest,
Though hee scape hanging, yet hee shall be prest.
