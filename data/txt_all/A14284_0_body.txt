My LORD:
MY Honourable good Lord, these are to signifie vnto you, that whereas I pub∣lished in print, many and sundry Bookes for the reading and vnderstanding of the sacred Scriptures, and my selfe being worne with age neare vn∣to the poynt of my pilgrimage, concluded with my selfe long since there to surcease: Neuer∣thelesse,
 of late, my Lord, I was importuned for the new Impres∣sion of this Booke, which almost twelue yeares since hath beene in request; whereunto I willingly yeelded, the rather vnder your Lo: fauour and protection, being my Honourable good neighbour, (although not worth nor worthy your reading.) For had it not beene anciently and truely said, that Hee is freer from blame that praiseth the dead, then he that praiseth the liuing, when the praiser cannot be mo∣ued with flattery, nor the praised with vaine-glory; then should I haue spoken of your Lo: more worthy deserts, and that whiles you are aliue, which I therefore must leaue to doe to the best learned in the Land when you are dead. And whereas also I
 durst not so much as thinke my writing fit your graue and pro∣found reading, I doe here there∣fore humbly acquaint your Lo: that the contents thereof is a kinde of Scripture Catechisme, by way of Questions and Au∣sweres, betweene the Pastor and the Parishioner, the one plainly and diuinely, the other a little Philosophically and plausibly, for the manner of handling. And so nothing doubting of your Lo: good acceptance, I humbly take my leaue, heartily desiring the Lord of eternall life, that by your good meanes, wee in these parts, and in your Iurisdiction, may haue a more peaceable pro∣ceeding in our preaching, and that the sincere professors there∣of may by you and such like, be more and more countenanced
 and comforted, as your Lordship hath well and graciously begun, to the glory of God, to the sauing of many thousand soules, and to your owne heauenly happinesse.
