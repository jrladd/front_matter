SIR,
THese following Paradoxi∣cal Assertions, long since written by the Authour for his Youthful Pastime and Delight, are now made publique for the Recreation of others also. The great Friendship you have had and still preserve with the Au∣thor,

may make a just Claim for you to any of his performances. But though your modesty will not challenge a priority of Dedicati∣on, nor do these Joco-seria of his need any Patronage: Yet that Kindeness and Humanity which for his sake you have freely ex∣pressed to me, is of it self without other respects, sufficient to em∣bolden me to this presumption, and to subscribe my self,
SIR,
