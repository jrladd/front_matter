Honoured
and
Reverend
Sirs,
AS it is the property of ge∣nerous
spirits, not to ex∣act
an answerable retaliation

for their afforded favours from
the party whom they have en∣gag'd:
So neither are they
wont to slight the petty
presents of a grateful heart,
whose greatest ambition is to be
thankful. This hath embold∣ened
me to offer you the small
fruits of my weak labours, or
rather recreations, gathered at
spare hours, in hope they may
so rellish with your palate, as
to move you to honour them
with a free acceptance: I doubt
not then but they will pass the
better, and be entertained with
more Approbation. VVhhat
though the wine of astonish∣ment

(I mean the blood of
Martyrs) be not so pleasant,
and consequently less desirable,
yet my hanging out the signes
of your hononrable names (at
the Frontispice of my Book)
will be very effectual to make
it vendible. Humility in your
selves, and charity towards me,
will cover all faults. I know
you are my Honourable and
Reverend good Friends, and
Amici omnia, amicè interpre∣tantur,
so will you this my
good will. Now if it be your
pleasure to make use of me, I
am here prest for your small
Service, till I am able to per∣form

greater. So praying God
to fill you with as much happi∣ness
both here and hereafter, as
your hearts can hold, I take
my leave of you; but shall al∣wayes,
while I have a tongue
and hand, acknowledge and
subscribe my self,
Etrolog. The seconD of the
MoVnth ApriL.
MDCLVI.
