MY LORD,
WHen your Honour was pleased to approve of my intentions of acquainting the World with this Narration, I beheld it with much fear, and had not your Lordships Incouragements an∣swered all the Objections I met with, I had chosen rather to deny the World a knowledge of it by my hand, than to expose it to the Cri∣tical view of this Censorious Age; But now since your Lordships former incouragements have transported me through all difficulties, I humbly lay my endeavours at your Lordships

feet, and hope, that although I have not satis∣fied my own desires, nor others expectation, yet your Lordship will Condescend to the Accep∣tance of my Endeavours, which are in all things to be found at

From my Chamber in Shaston, April 10. 1653.
