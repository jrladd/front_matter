My LORD,
DId not your Honours Merits claim this fourth and chief Part of my Labours as Your due, I durst not have assumed that audacity as to implore Your Ho∣nours Patronage; for as I have humbly made choice of the three preceding most Noble Heroes, So (my Lord) lest yet notwith∣standing my Fabrick should at length fall to the ground, (which it must inevitably do, unless Your Honour pass by the presumption and unworthiness of the Pen∣ner) I humbly presumed to crave Your Honours Patronage and support thereof (craving pardon for this my Simile) being the main pillar on which I desire
it should be built and upheld) not questioning then, but Your Honours Vertues and most Excellent Endow∣ments will adde such a lusture to the whole, that the beholders will not question the insufficiency or un∣worthyness of Me the Author, nor further call the thing it self in question, but with all assured confi∣dence accept thereof as most worthy and immacu∣late, which in it self I presume to conclude it is, how ever my weakness and insufficiency hath expres∣sed it to the World; the which as I question not but Your Honours piercing Judgement will discover, so I hope Your Honours Munificent goodness will pass over and pardon.
I must confess (my Lord) the ridiculous and base Mercenary practises of some that have pretended to the knowledge of this sublime Science hath brought the whole Art into contempt, and in question with the ignorant therein, and such as are not able to distinguish between the use and the abuse of a thing, or the purity of the thing studyed, and the corruption of the Student; whereby the very word ASTROLOGY, under which this most heavenly Science and peece of NATVRAL PHILOSOPHY is exprest, is be∣come both odious and ridiculous to most of the rural now living; but such is Yout Honors Magnanimity, that the Traduced shall not without diligent examination and evident witness be condemned, nor abolished Your Honours Presence, not making Tradition, but Truth and Experience the guide and ground of Your Judgement.
I shall not need here to speak ought in the be∣half of the whole Science, which I have endevoured in these my labours to purifie from its dross and fe∣culency, since in the preceding Epistles, and the first Book, I have hinted both at its Verity, Excellency and Validity; but only of this subsequent Discourse, which now after my great care and indefatigable pains being produced, I am by an happy gust drawn
to this Anchorage, and crave Your Honours acceptance and Patronage.
It is an Instruction to the whole General Part of that Liberal Science which is called ASTRONO∣MY or ASTROLOGY, the which together with PHYSICKS make according to Aristotle, 2. Phys. 2. Cap. but one intire Science; for he throughout all his works indifferently useth the Name of ASTRO∣LOGER and ASTRONOMER, and ASTRO∣LOGER and PHILOSOPHER for one and the same; and amongst all Ancient and Learned Writers Astrology and Astronomy have been received for one and the same Science, though distinct parts or properties, as hath been hinted at in the first Book of this Volume, and the 2. Chapter.
It containeth four Sections, the three first treating of the Revolutions of the Years of the World, and the fourth and last of Eclipses, Comets and Blazing-Stars, and the great Conjunctions of the Planets, by which we are taught how to judge of the order and course of Nature, and the Government of the World; as the general accidents of the World, and the alterations therein, the change of Laws, Customs, Empires and Governments, the alterations of the Ayr, the cause of Plenty, Scar∣city, Health, Sickness, Peace, Wars, &c. We may also hereby most manifestly see the infinite Wisdom, Providence and Government of GOD in the whole Vniverse by the constant Harmony and Celestial in∣fluences of the PLANETS and the STARS, whose Portencies, so long as GOD upholdeth the order and course of NATVRE unperverted, must inevitably prove true and effectual, they being never frustrated but by Miracle. My Lord, this is the ASTROLO∣GIA MVNDA, the Pure Astrology, which the Pa∣triarchs and the Antient Fathers studyed and contem∣plated: by which the Babylonians, Arabians, Syrians, Egyp∣tians, Grecians, Persians and Lacedemonians ruled and be∣came famous and glorious to the whole World, and
therefore (My Lord) as being the chief and most exqui∣site part of these my undertakings, I have placed it last, that so it might not be attempted by any that are unac∣quainted with the preceding Discourses, which serve but as it were Introductions hereunto, for which cause (My Lord) it is that I humbly presume to lay it at Your Honours Feet above any others, being so nerely bound to Eternise for ever Your late Honorable and Vertuous Consort of happy memory, doubting not but by the unparalleld splendour of Your Ho∣nours surpassing Endowments, it might be exalted to that hight of Honour as to be but accepted into Your Honours Presence, which will be a perpetual Fame unto it and him, who in all humility Presents it to Your Honour, and from thence assumes that Ho∣nour as to subscribe himself
My LORD,
