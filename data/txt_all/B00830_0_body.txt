HAuing (right wor∣shypfull) a Treatise sent vnto
mee to be Imprin∣ted, as touching the vse and abuse of dauncing: Collected
out of the works of the most worthie, and wel learned Deuine Doctour,
Peter Martir. I fancied to present the same (especiallie and
aboue the rest) to your worshyp and worthie person, onely enforced thereto
by the common brute of your rare zeale, singular vertue, and godly
Religion.
The partie by whose penne and paine it was translated, and
chaunged from Ro∣maine robe, to English vesture, is both vertuous, learned,
and godlie: and being stirred, as it were stinged foreward of ve∣rie zeale,
seeing these disordred and daly daunsings in the rude Countrey, marring
mennes manners, breeding much beastly  behauiour: and being
desirous to haue such rudenesse reformed in those quarters where he
is acquainted, requested and wyld me to procure in print the publish∣ing
thereof: VVhich hauing accom∣plished, I most humbly present the same to
your vvorshyppe, emboldned the ra∣ther vnder your name to haue it publish∣ed
and put forth in print, to the vew of the worlde, for that it hath bene
ouerloo∣ked and lyked of Diuines, zealous, Reli∣gious, learned, and godly.
VVherfore de∣siring you good Master Nowell, so it may bee taken
as a token of my good wyll to your vvorshyppe: I forbeare any farther to
molest you with my vnlettered lynes, beseching the euer and ouer ruling
Iehoua through his Christ Iesus our only ioy, to continue his good
blessings vpon you, and to make perfect the good he hath begunne in you, and
in vs all. Amen.
