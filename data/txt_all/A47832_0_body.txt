SIR,
IT is not without some Force
upon my self, that I have
Resolv'd upon This Dedi∣cation;
for I have no Am∣bition
to appear Pragma∣tical,
and to become the
Marque of a Peevish Faction: But since my
Duty will have it Thus, I shall accompt all
Other Interests as Nothing in Competition
with my Allegiance.


If Your Majesty shall vouchsafe to look
so far, and so low, as into the Ensuing Treatise,
You will find it, Sir, to be Partly, a Delibera∣tive
Discourse about the Means of Regulating
the Press; (the matter being at This Instant
under Publique Debate) and in Part, an
Extract of certain Treasonous, and Seditious
Passages, and Positions, which may serve to
Evince the Necessity of That Regulation. The
Latter of which, I do most Humbly Offer
to Your Royal Consideration, not presuming
in any Sort, to Concern Your Majesty in the
Former.
In This Extract, is presented to your Ma∣jesties
view; First, That Spirit of Hypocrisie,
Scandal, Malice, Errour, and Illusion, that Actu∣ated
the Late Rebellion. Secondly, A Mani∣festation
of the same Spirit Reigning still, and
working, not only by the same Means, but in
very many of the same Persons, and to the
same Ends; That is, There is a Combination,
and Design against Your Sacred Life, and
Dignity, which is carryed on by the same Ar∣guments,
Pretences, Wayes, and Instruments,
that Ruin'd Your Royal, and Blessed Father.

All which, I think my self Bound, not only
in Generals, to Declare; but more Particularly,
to Trace, and to Discover to Your Majesty, as a
Duty which I owe both to God, and to my
Sovereign.
The first part of the Conspirators Work, is
to disaffect the People toward Your Majesties
Person and Government; and their next Bu∣siness
is to Encourage, and Carry on those Sedi∣tious
Inclinations into Action.
Touching the Former; Scarce any one
Regicide or Traytor has been brought to Pub∣lique
Justice, since Your Majesties Blessed Re∣turn,
whom either the Pulpit hath not Cano∣nized
for a Saint, or the Press Recommended
for a Patriot, and Martyr. (beside the Arraign∣ment
of the Bench, for the very Formalityes of
their Tryals) What is the Intent, or what
may be the Effect of Suggesting to the People,
that there is no Iustice to be found, either in
Your Cause, or in Your Courts; Both which
are Struck at in the same Blow) is submit∣ted
humbly to Your Royal Wisdom. Nor is
the Faction less Industrious to draw an
Odium upon Your Majesties Person, and to
Perplex, Seduce, and Exasperate the Multitude,



in Matters of Religion, and concerning the
Government of the Church.
There have been Printed, and Reprinted,
since Your Majesties Happy Restauration,
not so few as a Hundred Schismatical Pam∣phlets,
against Bishops, Ceremonies, and Com∣mon-Prayer:
in many of which, Your Ma∣jesty
is Directly, and in All of them Implicitly,
Charg'd with an Inclination to Popery. The
Instruments that Menage This Part of the
Plot, are Ejected Ministers, Booksellers, and
Printers: and it is believed, by men of
Judgment, and Experience, in the Trade of
the Press, that since the late Act for Uniformity,
there have been Printed near Thirty Thousand
Copies of Farewel-Sermons (as they call them)
in Defiance of the Law. All which, as they
are now drawn together into one Binding,
(to the Number of betwixt Thirty and For∣ty)
and represented with Figures, do certain∣ly
make up one of the most Audacious, and
Dangerous Libels, that hath been made
Publique under any Government; and they
are now Printing it in Dutch too, for the
greater Honour of the Scandal. By These
Arts, and Practices, the Faction works upon



the Passions and Humours of the Common-People;
and when they shall have put Mischief
into their Hearts, their next Business is to
put Swords in their Hands, and to Engage
them in a direct Rebellion: which Intent of
theirs, together with the Means whereby they
hope to Execute it, I shall humbly lay before
Your Majesty in a few words.
That they Propose, and Labour another
Change, appears, First; From the Recourse they
have in almost all their Schismatical Papers to
the Obligation of the Covenant; which
is no other, than to Conjure the People under
the Peyn of Perjury, to Treat Your Majesty,
as the Covenanters did Your Father; and (in
a flat Contradiction to the Blessed Apostle)
to pronounce, that Hee that [OBEYES]
shall receive to himself Damnation. A Second
Proof of their Designe may be drawn from
their still pleading the Continuance of the
Long-Parliament; & the Sovereignty
of the People▪ which is but in Plain Terms,
to Disclayme Your Authority-Royal, and to De∣clare
to the World, that they want nothing but
Another Opportunity for Another Rebel∣lion.
What may be the Event of These Li∣bertyes,

belongs not to Mee to divine; but
that such Libertyes are taken, I do, with great
Reverence, presume to Enform Your Ma∣jesty:
And further; that the Visible Boldness,
and Malice of the Faction, seems not to be the
only Danger; Diverse of the very Instruments,
who are Entrusted with the Care of the Press,
being both Privy, and Tacitly Consenting to
the Corruptions of it; by virtue of which
Connivence, many Hundred-Thousands of Sedi∣tious
Papers, since your Majestyes Return,
have passed Unpunished. And yet in This
Prodigious Licence, and Security of Libelling
Your Sacred Majesty, and the Government,
let but any Paper be Printed that Touches
upon the Private Benefit of some Concerned
Officer; The Author of That Paper is sure
to be Retriv'd, and Handled with sufficient
Severity.
Finally; To present Your Majesty with
some Common Observations: It is noted,
First, as a very Rare Thing, for any Presbyte∣rian
Pamphlet to be Seiz'd, and Suppressed, un∣less
by Order from Above. Secondly, It is ob∣served
of Those Offenders that are Discove∣red,
that Generally the Rich have the Fortune



to Come off, and the Poor to Suffer: and
Thirdly; that scarce One of five, though under
Custody, is ever brought to either of Your Ma∣jesties
Principal Secretaryes of State.
I have now Discharg'd my Soul both to
God, and to Your Majesty; in what I take to
be an Honest, and a Necessary Office; and I
have done it with This Choice before me,
either to suffer the worst that Malice, or Ca∣luminy
can cast upon me, or to Forfeit my
Duty. I should not speak This but upon
Experience, nor dare to mention it upon This
Occasion, but that I think it highly Imports
Your Majesty to know how Dangerous a
Matter it is to Render you a Publique Service.
To present Your Majesty with a Fresh In∣stance;
I was lately Engaged as a Commissi∣oner,
in a Publique Debate on the behalf of
the Loyal Officers; and for no other Crime,
or Provocation, but for Asserting the Profess'd
Desires of the Whole Party: A Certain Gen∣tleman
took such a Heat, and Confidence, as
Openly to Charge me with Writing against
Your Majesty; Affirming withal, that Your
Majesty had Accused me for it to the Parlia∣ment



and that my Lord Chancellor would Iu∣stifie
it: Since which time, it appears, not
only that Hee Himself was the first Person
that by a Private Tale had Endeavoured to
Exasperate my Lord Chancellor against Me;
but that being called to Account by my Lords
Order, for so Great, and so Injurious a Bold∣ness,
both towards Your Majesty, and his Lord∣ship,
He desired God to Renounce him, if
ever he spake the Words, (Although
Delivered in the Face of a Full Committee.) If
I were Impudent enough to trouble Your
Majesty with a Personal Character, His Fa∣miliar
Discourses, both concerning your Sa¦cred
Majesty, and the Honourable House of
Commons, would afford matter for it; but
let God witness for me, that I have no
Passion, but for your Majesties Service, and
for the General Good of Your Loyal Sub∣iects:
Both which Interests, I do humbly
conceive to be very much concern'd in some
Provision, that men may not suffer in their
Reputations, for doing their Duties; and
that Those Persons who have Chearfully, and
Honourably passed through the utmost ex∣tremities

of a Long and Barbarous Warr,
out of a sence of Loyalty to Your Royal
Father, may not now at last, be stung to
Death by the Tongues of Tale-Bearers, and
Slanderers for being Faithful to Your Majesty.
Which is the Case of Many, more Conside∣rable
then my Self, and among the Rest in
Particular of
