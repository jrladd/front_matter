Courteous Ladyes, and Gentlewomen,
AS this little Treatise is a Messelin of divers hid∣den Secrets; So likewise you must observe the use of them in Practice. As first, the use and know∣ledge of the severall Parts of Anato∣mie; so likewise doe of the rest, as

Physicke, Surgerie, Medicine, Waters, Ʋnguents, Emplaisters, Remedies, &c. The rare vertue of our English Bathes, the Iudgement of divers Ʋrines; the vertue and operation of divers Herbes, Plants, and Drugs, &c. All tending to the benefit and use of man; yet vari∣ous and different in their effects and workings, according to the severall humours and dispositions of men in their Cures. For as St. Paul doth say, The guift of Healing is the guift of the Holy Spirit. Which thing may partly satisfie any rationall judgement from despising of all for the failings of some, it being the gleanings of divers who made tryall of them for good, and hath left them to Posterity. Thus leaving you Ladies and Gentlewomen, to your charitable acting and doing good when need shall require, the Lord no doubt will requite you or yours with a bles∣sing.
