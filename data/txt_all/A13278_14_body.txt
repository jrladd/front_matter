YOur double Title to My single heart,
Both by your Purchase, and your Parents Right;
Claims both a better and a greater Part
Of gratefull Seruice, than This slender Mite.


Yet, sith (to profit, more than please) I write
More Sighes than Songs (lesse vs'd to Smiles than Smart)
Disdain not These Restrainers of Delight;
Though bitter, fitter, than the Soothing Art,


To keep the Minde and Bodie both in Health;
To coole the Fits of Lust, Ambition, Pride
(Surfaits of Ease, Youth, Liberty, and Wealth)


And cure All Sickness of the Soule, beside.
Whence, Euer free; and full of Euery Good
From GOD and Men, be ESSEX Noble Bud.
