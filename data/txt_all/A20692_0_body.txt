EXcellent Ladie: I send vnto your La: from the Court of a forreine Prince, this volume of my second labours: as to the worthiest Patronesse, of Musicke: which is the Noblest of all Sciences: for the whole frame of Nature, is nothing but Harmonie, as wel in soules, as bodies: And because I am now remoued from your sight, I will speake boldly, that your La: shall be vnthank∣full to Nature hir selfe, if you doe not loue, & defend that Art, by which, she hath giuen you so well tuned a minde.
Your Ladiship hath in your selfe, an excellent agreement of many vertues, of which: though I admire all, Yet I am bound by my profession, to giue especi∣all honor, to your knowledge of Musicke: which in the iudgement of ancient times, was so proper an excelencie to Woemen, that the Muses tooke their name from it, and yet so rare, that the world durst imagin but nine of them.
I most humby beseech your La: to receiue this worke, into your fauour: and the rather, because it commeth far to begit, of you. From Helsingnoure in Denmarke the first of Iune.
1600.
Your Ladiships
in all humble deuotion:
Iohn Dowland.
