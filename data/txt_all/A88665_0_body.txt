SIR,
THat I might shun that mon∣strous Vice, which before God and Man is account∣ed most Hatefull, in which (as Tully saith) is contain∣ed all Wickedness, name∣ly, Ingratitude; and that which when the Persians, Macedonians, or Athenians found that any man was guilty of, they condemned him to death by their Law; so odious and abominable was it unto them; and hence the saying is, Ingrato homine nil pejus, and Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris. Therefore, Sir, I that have in no small measure tasted of your good∣ness and clemency, as in many other things, so in countenancing this small Work of mine (for not onely the Foun∣dation thereof hath been layed) but the whole Structure thereof hath been rear∣ed, in my (as yet) so short being with you.

And fearing that as soon as it shall ap∣pear to the publick view, it may need some favourable aspect over it, to shelter it abroad in the World, from evil and ma∣levolent eyes, I hope, Sir, it will not be offensive, that I do pitch upon your worth and virtue for that effect; since I offer it as a testimony of my heart (and not onely eye) service unto you. As also, Sir, seeing that you do very well know, how that Mens inoccupata mox evadit corrupta, sicut deses aqua, the Mind unoccupied will quickly be corrupted, even as standing water sooner corrupts and purrifies, than that which hath its course to run with a full Current; and that hence Seneca, that Christian-like Pagan (as one of the Fa∣thers term'd him) saies, In mille facinorum furias mens otiosa discurrit, the Mind that is idle, or unoccupied, runs into a thou∣sand villanies; and that that of Cicero is most true, Nihil agendo homines meleagere discunt, by doing nothing, Men learn to do evil; Idleness (as St. Bernard saith) is the sink and receptacle of all filth. Therefore, Sir, setting before me, as a pattern, your own industrious virtue, I do hereafter alwaies resolve (God willing) to remember that saying, Non minus est virtus, quam quaerere parta tueri, it is no less a virtue to keep than to get; and

there is no way to keep (the little) things gotten, and to get a little more, but by diligent practice; for hence our Proverb is, Solus usus facit Artifices. These Ex∣pressions, Sir, and the thoughts they flow from, arising from the experience of your humane Ingenuity, I am confident shall not displease you; as I also am very hope∣full that you will not refuse to accept of these my present weak endeavours in this Work, and the publishing of it, after your name prefixed unto it, considering it doth proceed from a gratefull mind. And therefore, Sir, praying and wishing you  shalom shalom, all peace and happiness, not onely now, but especially for ever hereafter, I shall en∣deavour to approve my felf,
Sir,
