THere is no Apology to be made (my very Honoured) for the Confidence of my presenting this Sermon to you, but the Transcendent Weight and Excellency of the Subject; and that wherever this Discourse comes, your giving such Encouragement to the Preaching the Gospel of Christ, on which occasion this Sermon was Preached, may be spoken of by it in Memorial of you, and of my own Grateful Sense of my participation of your Favour and Good-will therein, who Acknowledg my self most unworthy of any such. I Acknowledg, I have Darkened the Counsels of so Great a Truth by Words without Knowledg; But who is sufficient for it according to its Dignity? The Se∣crets of this Wisdom are double to All can be said of it; But if there be any Thing spoken with the Evidence of Di∣vine Truth, or in Any Measure (through Gracious Assistance) Worthy of it, or Acceptable to any of the Servants of Christ, or your selves in particular; I desire most Humbly, it may by a proportion of Acceptance, be Transferred to the Do∣ctrine of the Kingdom of Christ, and the Line of Time to it, I have so laboured in; yet not I, but the Grace of Christ with me; For, if the Lord hath enabled his unworthiest Ser∣vant to speak in this Great Point aright, and according to his Word, and the Divine Reason of it, I hope it will hence
 appear, He hath Enabled me to give Good Heed to what I have spoken, and whereof I have Affirm'd, and on what grounds I have so Affirm'd concerning the Great Revolution of the Kingdom of Christ, so near as 1697. and which I cannot but Humbly Look upon, as that Especial Dispensation committed to me, and therein I magnify my Office. And so I commend All to Divine Influence, and Blessing, Preparing by this Discourse for his Kingdom, and Assuring it thereby to us; And for all Blessings, and most Gracious Presence of God with you in all your Stations, Action, and Conditions, especially in Heavenly Places, and Things are the most unfeigned Supplications of,
Honoured Gentlemen,
