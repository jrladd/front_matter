Sir,
YOur great Civility to all, and in particular to my self, gives me an assurance that you will kindly accept that which I here present your Worship; even a Sermon in which I hope the meanness and lowness of the stile, will not any ways diminish the excellency of the matter, viz. our Saviours Body, which you spiritually feed upon every Communion
day, nay continually, seeing we feed upon it in our Celestial Meditations of Christ; I de∣sire therefore your Worship to look upon the Matter not on the Work it self, being not worthy of your Acceptance: Indeed Sir, I had not assumed the boldness to offer this Present unto you, if I had not been sure of your singular Goodness; I have had of it so much Experience, that it should be a kind of crime to question it; and indeed a true Subject of the Glorious Monarch of Eng∣land as your Worship is, and hath always been, will not disdain that which an infe∣riour offereth him, seeing that the Great Charles refuseth not such things from the most inferiour Person amongst his Sub∣jects. Truly Sir, the Obligations which I owe you are so great, that I am obliged to let others know the Civilities I have re∣ceived from your Noble and Generous Per∣son, and by your means from your most worthy Family; for I have nothing else to
present you with, but the acknowledgement of your great courtesie, which I being sen∣sible of, cannot but present my Prayers to the Almighty God of Heaven for your and your Families Prosperity, remaining with all the sincerity of my heart,
Sir,
