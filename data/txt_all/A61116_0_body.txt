My Lord,
SCarce had this Alien (born in a Forreign, and nourisht in this Nation) opened an eye in search of a Noble Mecaenas, to na∣turalize and protect it, when
your Eminent VVorth and Learning attracted them wholly to your self: the one assuring a proneness to ac∣cept; the other, a power to set a true Estimate of this small Present. As small in∣deed as Nothing, if you re∣gard the minuteness of the Volume; and yet as great as All things, if you consider what is exhibites, viz. GOD, the Best of All things, whose unavoidable existence it first endeavors to deduce by Lo∣gical Consequence, from
what every one most evi∣dently experiences; then to shadow out his Essence, and lastly, to give some taste of his Attributes: and this one∣ly as a Foundation to a fur∣ther discovery (in some en∣suing Tracts) of his Power, Providence, Revelations, Mysteries, and Conduct of sinful Man to eternal Hap∣piness. May it therefore please your Honor, to de∣prive your more Serious and Important Affairs of so small a portion of time, as
may suffice to cast an eye upon his small Tract: And for the Author of it, as you Justly possess the Ancient Domaine of his Name and Family, so you would please Favourably to Patronize those few dispersed Reliques which yet remain of it; whereof I am the least and lowest.
My Lord,
