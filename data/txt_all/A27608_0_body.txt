Honoured Sir,
ALthough I must ever Acknow∣ledge a long Series of very great Obligations to your Friendship, and Favour for me; Yet That is not the Sole, nor so much as the Principal Reason of the presenting this following Discourse to your Acceptance: The more Due Reasons of that are, That by the Freedoms you have Allowed me of Conversation with you; I have very un∣doubted Evidences of your sincere Love to the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory; in its present Spiritual
 Evangelical Administration; and in its Gradual Illustrations of it self in Glory, Promised and Foretold to the latter Days. And yet more particularly, as in All Things I had observed, your Patriottal Spirit, your Great Love to your Coun∣try, the true English Spirit; so your Great Love to Protestancy, and Bewail∣ing, That no Greater Liberty and Security could be procured, for the Suffering Pro∣testants beyond the Seas, and particularly in France. But I hope God supports you in so long a Life, to see the Open∣ings of his Kingdom. And That your Honourable Lady, whom I have long observed the Truest Consort of All the Va∣rieties, that God hath been pleased to Dis∣pensate to you, may Rejoyce with you in that so Great Joy, is the Humble Ear∣nest Prayer of, Most Honour'd Sir,
