GReat Senators though in those stor∣my
times and Illiads of great af∣faires,
wee present to your Ho∣nours,
as one did to Antipater a
Treatise, the subject whereof is
Happinesse;  yet wee are Confident wee shall
have a better Answerthen I am not at leisure. Our
humble suit is, for the Pure Worship of the true
God, and the quite abolishing of the Service-Book,
with the Hierarchicall Maintainers of it, both
Enmity to Christ, Kingdome; this (as we con∣ceive)
is the prime Worke of the day, saving
health is the greatest good,Salus sum mum b∣num. and Purity in Worship
is the onely meanes to attaine the End, and you
are the Instruments of Instruments to advance this 

Worke. We desire no more of your Honours,
but that the Reasons of our requests may be
weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, &


ut res cum re,Hicrom & ratio cum ratione comparetur,
that Matter with Matter, and Reason with
Reason (as a Father saith) may be compared,
and that which is found light may be cast out
of the Sanctuary. It suits neither with the Ho∣nour
of your Place, nor greatnesse of the work:
that you should either see with Dr. Halls eyes,
or with ours; but that Eye-clearing word,
should be the light of your Eyes, as we hope it
is: the Doctor his Charging upon Gods people
with Passionate reproaches, recoyles enough
upon himselfe; though Tully telleth us, that bad
Orators, instead of Reasons, Vse, Declamations,
we could not have expected it from so great an
Orator as the Doctor; we seeke not Corban nor
Mammon, as our adversaries doe, but the King∣dome
of Christ in the Purity of his Worship,
which is first of all to be sought; for Reforma∣tions
begins at the Sanctuary. You are those
Eliakims that must set the Lord upon his glori∣ous
Throne, and hee will make you as Nayles
in a sure place: to whose Honours wee shall
ever he devoted,
