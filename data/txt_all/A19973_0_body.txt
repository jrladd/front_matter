PLeaseth your honour: The re∣uerend account wherwith the curious regarders of whatso∣euer excelencie, haue enter∣taigned euermore the deserts and honoured examples, of suche as in their times haue approoued most worthy hath mooued me (the most vnskil∣full of a great manie, but not the least in wel-wishing) to a∣dorne the funeralls of the most noble and worthye re∣nowmed knight, Sir Phillip Sidney, with these slender me∣ters. Whose yong yeares continued with all manner of expectation of such honor, as by due desert he long since acquired, hath made the remembraunce of his death, so much the more famous, by how much the more hono∣rablie he hath put forwarde the same, in so laudable an action, as wherein consisteth his loue, seruice, and obe∣dience, to God, his Prince, and his Countrie. The argument hereof, in zeal of his great Nobility, valour, & worthines (which vpon a sodain I haue penned, more answerable to

mine owne good intendment, then to the weight of his excellencies) I dedicate with all humility vnto your ho∣nour. Beseeching, that according to the wonted nobili∣tie of your mind, it may please you to accept & accompt thereof, as proceeding from the simple store of suche a one, who in al humble duty and reuerence, gladly would bind himself to do your honor anie seruice. And though the simplicity of the same is such, as in no poynt maye chalenge vnto it selfe such honourable liking, yet maye it please your honour to deem, that the affection of him that writ it, stoode in the highest degree of wel-doing, and gladly (if the continuance therof, had bene of more value) could haue submitted the same to your fauorable censure. And that I maye not seeme ouer tedious in so briefe a discourse, I humblie surcease herewith to detein your honour, praying the eternall director of all your actions, to haue the same euermore in his gracious pro∣tection.
