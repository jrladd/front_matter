Intirely Beloved,
THE importunate Desires of many of you, have Midwiv'd this imperfect Discourse into the World, tho' much against my Inclination; and indeed, the Reluctancies and Struglings in my Mind about it, have hindered the exposing of it to public View until now; not because I am in the least measure ashamed of that great and fundamental Truth, which is the Subject of this Discourse, or unwilling the World should know my Judg∣ment herein: This cannot be reasonably supposed, if it be considered, that these Sermons were not Preached to a few in a Corner, but to a very considerable number of People, and at a Meeting-Place of as great Note as any in London. But because of the Shortness, Broken and Abrupt manner of handling it, and also considering, that many Learned and Worthy Men are in Print on this Subject; and lest I should be thought Ambitious, to be numbered among them, altho' (so far as I am acquainted with my own Heart) I can say, I esteem my self altogether Ʋnworthy to be Book-Bearer to the least amongst all those Orthodox Ministers, that have treated on this Subject; however, to accomo∣date
your Desires, I have adventured to break through the Crowd of Impediments, which seemed to lye in the way; and having taken a short Review of the whole (as it was taken in Short-Hand) I find you have in great part, the Substance of what I delivered unto you, (tho' something consi∣derable is omitted) but nothing added: For I considered, if I had put it into another form, clipp'd, dress'd, and made any considerable Additions to it, to please the Curiosity of this Cen∣sorious Age, it would have look'd so much unlike what I Preach'd at Pinners-Hall, that you would find your selves disappointed, it not proving the same you expected. The Discourse was designed for ordinary Capacities, and poor plain-hearted Christians, for their Information, and Esta∣blishment in the Truth; and I dare say (without blushing) the Food in this Dish is wholsom Food, tho' I am perswa∣ded every Body will hardly believe it, and that not a few will utterly reject it, because it is not set forth, and gar∣nish'd to their Minds; but it being intended for the needy and hungry Soul, and not for dainty and nice Appetites, tho' it may not sute and agree with the (punick) Stomachs of the latter, yet it will please and contribute Nourishment to the Souls of the former, if the Lord accompany it with his Blessing, which is the Earnest Prayers of Your

4th Day of the 11th Month, 1693/4.
