IT has been an Injury too often done to the Memory of Persons eminent for Knowledge,

Learning, and Virtue, to have after their Death such Works obtruded upon the World for theirs, as have been deservedly suspected; or if theirs, yet were never intended by them in that squalid, broken, and imper∣fect condition, to have been published. But as for this Tract you were pleased to put into my hands to peruse, it is not only cer∣tain that it was Wrote by the Honourable Person whose Name it bears; but

also that it was designed by him for the Press; as some Pas∣sages in it do apparently shew.
And if this Noble and Learned Author thought it seasonable for those TimesAnno 1647. of Uncontroul'd Liberty and Confusion in which it was wrote, it is as seasonable, if not more, at the present; when that Vice against which it is directed, has of late Years so far prevail'd, to the great Dishonour of our Na∣tion, as well as our Religion, that the Patriots of our

Countrey assembled in Par∣liament, have been thereby justly provok'd to prepare that late Bill (which since has pass'd the Royal Assent) for the better and more ef∣fectual Punishment and Sup∣pression of it. A Design becoming so August an As∣sembly; and in the Prosecu∣tion of which your Honours must be esteemed to have done considerable Service, especially by the Publication of this Treatise, which has been so happily recovered,

and by a singular Providence reserved, as it were, for such a special Season and Service.
