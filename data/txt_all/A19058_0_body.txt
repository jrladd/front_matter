MOST worthy to be most ho∣nored Lord; All outward honors and accomplish∣ments of height, already most abundantly & bles∣sedly adorning you; I thrice humbly submit to your Lordship, (in as

much as this little Vo∣lume may containe) as ample meanes to all in∣ward addition and illu∣stration: In teaching all Manly and Lordly go∣uerment of those in∣vvard Passions and per∣turbations that are euer∣more excited by out∣vvard Pleasures, and all their storme-rockt soo∣things of security and licence. For no more doth the Sun and Wind; exhale and blovv vppe pasttemper, Vapors and Tempests; then the gra∣ces, and amplifications

of Kings; cause aestures & vprores of affection and Passion▪ Yet is there not any more sencible varie∣ty of medicine and cure, for all bodily wounds and maladies: then there are intelligible and rea∣sonable repressions and setlings of all the vnqui∣et, and raging ouerflowes of our Spirits and minds. Neither is there any so deadly danger layd open in the one, as abides hid in the other. For as that tempest is more dange∣rous that suffers not a ship to repaire to her ha∣uen,

then that which su∣staines not shee should sayle at all▪ So most difficult are the minds stormes, that let a man to containe himselfe; nor suffer him▪ to quiet and settle his disturbed rea∣son. And therefore all men floting on the high-going seas of Fortune, if destitute of Pylots, Ca∣bles, and Anchors; and moued only with tumul∣tuous and vnbounded errors, in vncertaine and dangerous courses; may for a time perhaps in safe∣ty and pleasure enioy, and

extend them: But at length (as t'were suddain∣ly rauisht by the neckes) they are driuen helplesly headlong on the more horrible ship-wrackes. Since then your Lord∣ships disposition to all goodnesse is in nature most sweete, most flexi∣ble; vouchsafe eare a lit∣tle to artificiall and ex∣perimenc't aduices, that may rectifie, accomplish and establish you in all the heights of your ho∣nors. Wherein my hum∣ble and poore endeauors obtaining their desired

ends; I shall holde my selfe happy, and rest in all seruiceable de∣uotion,
