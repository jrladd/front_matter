SIR,
IT is not many Mo∣neths since you accep∣ted from my hands, at the second hand, my mournefull Meditati∣ons compiled in the late memorable Mortalitie of the Plague: And heretofore for this good while, I haue constantly sent, and im∣parted vnto you, all manner of Forraine Newes and Nouelties of moment;

whereof you haue beene, and are desi∣rous and studious, and the rather be∣cause of your sedentarie life at home, and seldome or never stirring abroad, for divers yeeres past; So now, I pray, giue me leaue to impart vnto you this domestique Newes, and most true Re∣lation of a fearefull Earthquake, which happened lately in the Citie and place of my Nativitie: within a few dayes after I had been there, to visite nay nee∣rest and dearest friends; who now are witnesses of the same, from whom (as also from others) I haue the certaine in∣formation of it. I doubt not but you re∣ceived the severall Pamphlets I lately sent you by your trustie servant R. H. And, it being your condition now to be so farre remote from London, (in a fresh Aire and sweet soyle,) where

Novelties are the more welcome vnto you; It hath rather induced mee to In∣scribe vnto you, at the first hand, this small Pamphlet of a prodigious Acci∣dent: For other matters, I hope I shall not forget still to send you, knowing your earnest desire after them: and I cannot mervaile thereat, considering, Est natura hominis Novitatis avida: I must leaue to enlarge my selfe further vnto you by way of Epistle, because the thing it selfe is, I say, but a Pam∣phlet: Only, With your pleasant si∣tuated Place, I wish and pray for your health and welfare in soule and body: And so I take my leaue.
HALLELVIAH.
