May it please your Grace
TO accept of the fol∣lowing Discourses as a Testimony of my Humble Thankfulness for your Grace's Favours towards

me. The Substance of them was lately delivered to a small Country Auditory, into whose Minds I endeavoured to instill a Generous Sense of Virtue, being Convinced not only of the Great Ʋsefulness of such Monitory Exhortati∣ons in a Degenerate Age, but fully persuaded, that if Men Neglect the Sincere Practice of Virtue, the Re∣novation of their Minds in∣to the faultless Image of Je∣sus will never effectually be carried on. I most Humbly Beg your Grace's Pardon for their Imperfections, hoping your Grace will not be offend∣ed

at the Meanness of an Of∣fering which proceeds only from a Desire of doing Good. And to Assure your Grace of the Ʋprightness of my In∣tentions herein, I have add∣ed as an Appendix I judged not unsuitable to the foregoing Discourses, one likewise of Sincerity, in which your Grace will see the high E∣steem and Value I have of that Lovely Qualification.
Now that God would pre∣serve your Grace in Health and Prosperity for the Good and Benefit of this Church and Nation, and after you

have finished your Course, that your Grace may receive a never fading Crown of Glory when the chief Shep∣herd shall appear, is the hearty Prayer of
My Lord,
