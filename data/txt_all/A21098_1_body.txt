SIR, it is not long, since it first pleased you to grace mee with your acquaintance. Yet in so littell time, I haue obserued great arguments, of your more then most singular loue, to this neuer sufficiently beloued and admired faculty of Mu∣sick: as namely, the perfit pleasure and content∣ment you seeme to take therein; Your indefati∣gable assiduite in the priuate exercise thereof, which hath gayned you such a perfection that way, as is rare in a Gentelman of your ranck▪
And lastly your courteous and amiable deportment toward my poore selfe, and others, such as my selfe, the sonnes of Musick, when by chance you light among vs. Vnworthie were I then of that thrise worthie Mother, vn∣worthie to be phrased a sonne of Musick, should I not hartely affect and ho∣nour you, in such sort as I doe, whom I find so intirely to loue and honour hir. And hence it is, euen of my loue which you haue well deserued for loueing hir so well,  you out, among so many my worshipfull good friends▪ nd labours, & haue first presented them  and countenance they might passe ab therefore to entertaine them, rable acceptance: which I assure  doe; especially since they come in so  new yeere, when vsually all gifts  whose abilitie will not reach to pre∣  nd so I humbly take my leaue, from Ely
