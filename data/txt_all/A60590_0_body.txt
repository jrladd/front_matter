SIR,
PResuming upon your leave and favour, I take the li∣berty of inscribing your name before two short dis∣courses, written several years since, which I now pub∣lish with very little alteration. In the time of a great fire no one is to be an idle stander by or looker on: but he is to contribute, as much as in him lyes, to the extinguishing of the raging and devouring flames: tho' it be onely by handing a bucket of water toward the next engine, which others are laboriously managing with art and skill. This seems to be our present case. Dissoluteness of manners, like a pestilential vapour, having diffused its venimous influence farre and wide, and Atheisme and Deisme growing rampant, and all Religion, whether natural or revealed and instituted, being run down and ridiculed by several, who set up for Wits and Virtuosos, and pretend to greater measures of reason and understanding, than their dull forefathers ever had, who, it seems, preposses∣sed and prejudiced by a simple education, could not attain to those new discoveries, which they have made: a due concerne for the honour of God and of religion, which is founded upon eternal and essential rules of righteousness and wisdom, will justifie any mans discreet and sober zeal, in opposing the growth of such outragious and impudent blasphemy and infidelity.

This I alledge in defense of my little attempt: tho' it may be, it will be lookt upon to be almost as vaine, as if I should go about to stop the violent current of water at London-bridge, when it comes swelling and flowing in with full wind and tide, with my naked hand: all other methods and remedies at present in this wicked and licentious age being ineffectual, I must not say, without a temporary Inquisition, but I will say, without a strict and rigorous execution of the laws, made by our wise and god∣ly Ancestors: which would make these bold men, if not more sober, honest, and virtuous, at least more modest, reserved, and decent in their behaviour and conduct. Having thus made out the sincerity of my intention and design in publishing these Papers, I am the less sollicitous, whether I have with equal care and judgment performed the part of a Scholar, as well as of a Church-man: of which such excellently learned and thoroughly accomplished Gentlemen, as your self, are the most able and proper Judges. But however, whilst I am endeavou∣ring in my mean way to serve and promote the common cause and interest of religion and virtue, I readily take advantage of this address; which I present, as a memorial of the great respect, esteem, and honour, I have for you, upon the accompt of your public services and merit, and also of the many great obligations, flowing from an entire friendship, which you have been pleased for several years to lay upon
SIR,
