THE late gracious acceptance, most worthy yong Prince (with so prompt & welwilling hand, so amiable and plea∣sant a countenance, and so kinde and courteous words,) of those mine hastie and bold attempted labours, in transla∣ting into Latin and English verse the seuerall Precepts and Instructions of our dread Soueraigne your Fathers Maiesties ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ ΔΩΡΟΝ, for your owne sake, and vnto your owne selfe by him so Christianly, fatherly, painfully and learnedly first penned: that Princes Looking-glasse, or Princes direction, (for that title or inscription I then thought best befitting such an argument) so benignly accep∣ted of, hath animated and encouraged me once againe, to pub∣lish vnder your Graces Patrocinie, an other Looking-glasse, to wit, this present Loyall Subiects Looking-glasse, or a good subiects Direction, a treatise I suppose in these our last dayes and perillous times, very requisite and necessarie for all Christian subiects, like as was the other for a Christian Prince. A fault I confesse is by me here committed, by this my second so bold an enterprise, but yet Priùs perspecta clementia, & lenitate tua fretus, in good hope you will beare with my wants and imperfec∣tions, and accept and respect mine heart, and plaine simple well
meaning will, and rather poyse the quantitie of mine affection and zeale to do good, (according to the gaine of that one poore talent that the Lord God hath committed vnto me,) then the qualitie of mine offence, I haue aduenturd towards the helpe and instruction of the rude and ignorant sort of subiects, who want both good bookes and good teachers, to publish this my sil∣lie Treatise befitting silly subiects, least through ignorance of their duties in true allegiance, they might the sooner be sedu∣ced, deceiued, and withdrawne from giuing vnto Caesar that which is Caesars. Simple and plaine indeed is this my worke, I must simply confesse, but yet an instrument of mine inward good affection, and a faithfull witnessing messenger before both God and man, of my well-willing and well-meaning heart, Qui si non potui maxima parua dedi. And if your Grace (according to your former clemencie) shall happily vouchsafe it that good successe as to come abroade to the view of the world vnder the wings of your benigne defence and fauourable protection, then I doubt not but of the better sort it shall be the better accepted, and also from the nipping cancred Cater-pillers the more freely escape vntaunted, whose naturall inclination is rather to prie at the moates in other mens eyes, and to carpe and finde faults with other mens dooings, then to respect and perceiue beames in their owne eyes, or endeuour to profit Gods Church and their country with any their owne better labours. The euer-liuing God for his annointed Christ Iesus his sake, graunt you his eternall fa∣uour, grace, and blessing, long and many happy yeares, with your owne hearts desired felicitie, to the aduauncement of Gods honour and glory, to the ioye and comfort of all good faithfull Christian hearts, to the terror of all your, and our forreigne enemies, and home-borne conspirators, and to the hap∣pie conuersion or vtter confusion of the publique and priuate aduersaries of Gods eternall truth.
