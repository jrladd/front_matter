MADAM,
IT is now high time that your Princely eyes should no longer contract Redness from Tears, but a brave fire from revenge, that you should deal with your passion as the generous Or∣mond with that infamous fire-brand of the World, that Canker to the Royal tock and Branches, Cromwel, suffer it to possess some Out-skirts and Frontiers of your Soul, that by the expansi∣on of his incroachments, its spirits may be wasted and laid open for ruine; And your victorious reason (contracting all its forces) sweep all such Treacher us invaders from the face of the World, and leave nothing of it in Nature but a memory, which may make it stink to all Posterity.
Porcia's Coals are of no further use for despair, all they can be serviceable in, is to create a flame to which the Barbarous rebels must be fuel, and the fire may be a purifier to the region of Sove∣raignty, cleering all the air from those two greatest plagues to or∣der and mankind, Rebellion and Regicide: God has now ripe∣ned them for the Sickle of Revenge; it is highly opportune to shake them from the Trees of Authority and Rapine wheren they hang: And since hanging is natural for such Gomorrah Ap∣ples, Tyburn in England is the properest place in the World for such Fruits, if their rottenness be not too violent Eye sores to the view, and of too great a stench to the Nosethrils of Passengers.

The 30th of January shall be reckoned amongst those Ominous dayes which are fatal to the repose and safety of Nations, which though it antecede here that in England by ten dayes, yet my passion of Revenge, and my engagement to follow that Standard of your Heroick Son, which must cary with it a restitution of the World to Laws, Liberty, Religion, Conscience, and all other O∣bligatins Divine and Humane, hath made me make use of the Kalender in France, and present an Anniversary upon the most horrid Murder the Sun ever viewed; not to stir up your un ex∣ampled piety to tears, but to awake your own royal and other loy∣al Bosomes to revenge; which when it shall break forth in its just magnitude and dimensions, the Rebells will then confess, That Our silence is like a Calm, whose unsuspected Tran∣quility is followed by nothing less dangerous then totally subverting Earth-quakes, or universal consuming Thun∣der.
Madam, The Persian Princes had a constant Moniter to re∣member them of Greek affronts and injuries, may this Anni∣versary be your Remembrancer that all Europe is engaged to your assistance; That you have a Fate more noble imnding then to live in Exile, or Ʋn-revenged; That you have a SON, who by his fiery persecutions and vertues, will one day make good in his examples all which is related of the mst excellent Princes; That there is a Nation which with infinite groans im∣plores its restitution to Monarchy, its redemption from ebelli∣on, in whih it is fatally captivated and engulphed and (which Madam deseves a lower rank amongst thse more Majestick con∣cernments  let it be a speaking testimony to the World, that I am (in spight of all the revolutions occasioned by Thieves, Re∣bells, and Regicdes)
