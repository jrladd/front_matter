My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Here present your Honours with a short Account of some great Oppressions, &c. many of us Their Majesties poor Imprisoned Subjects have, and still do Groan under, tho' we must with all Thankfulness Acknow∣ledg your great Goodness and Charity, in that the last Sessions you were pleased in a great mea∣sure to hear our humble Petitions, and pass that most Gracious Act, For Relief of poor Prisoners for Debt or Damages, by which many Thousands of Their Majesties poor Imprisoned Subjects are Released from their Starving Condition,
and are thereby inabled to serve Their Majesties and the Common∣wealth both at Sea and at Land, in this time of Exigency, and also in some measure are inabled to pay their Honest Debts, and to Main∣tain themselves and Families, all which was impossible for them to do during their Imprisonment; and it were to be wished, that this most Gracious Act had been with∣out a Limited Summ, which then would have Reliev'd many Thou∣sands more of us Their Majesties most Miserable and Oppressed Sub∣jects, and many Hundred of Thou∣sands of Pounds of Debts had been paid, which now of necessi∣ty, by reason of our continuance in Prisons, will, (besides the Ser∣vice of our Persons,) be lost to this Nation. And now most No∣ble Patriots, In this small Book here present to your View ou
Wounds and our Distempers, our Boils and our Carbuncles, the Briberies and Perjuries, the Op∣pressions and Extortions, we Groan under. You are not only our Princes, but our Physicians, unto whom should we Complain and Cry, (next to God and Their Majesties,) but to You for Heal∣ing? Oh! give us the poor Impri∣soned no longer cause to Cry our in the Words of the Prophet Jere∣miah, Is there no Balm in Gilead, is there no Physician there? Why then is not the Health of the Daughter of my People Recovered? And now you have open'd the Pri∣son-Doors, and let many Thou∣sands of us the poor Out-casts dwell with you, be you still a Covert to us that remain in Prisons from the Face of the Spoiler; Let Extortion have an end, let the Spoi∣ler cease, and let the Oppressors be
consumed out of the Land, who by reason of the multitude of their Op∣pressions, make us the poor Oppressed Prisoners to Cry. Then in Mercy shall the Throne be Established to our gracious King & Queen, & they shall sit upon it in Truth, Judging, and speaking Judgment, and hasting Righteousness. And be you such Counsellors to Their Majesties, as Jethro advised Moses to take; Able Men, such as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Covetousness, and then God will be with you, and help you against the Mighty Ene∣mies of Their Majesties and these Kingdoms, and all other Oppressors, which is the Hearty Prayers and Desires of
