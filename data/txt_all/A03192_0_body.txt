THis Age affording
more Poets than
Patrons (for nine
Muses may travell
long ere they can find one Me∣coenas)
made mee at a stand to
whom I might commend the de∣dication
of this small Tractate,
especially bearing this Title. To
any Matron I durst not, though
never so modest; lest her consci∣ence
might alledge unto her

she had beene guilty of reading
the like Lectures. To a Mar∣ried
man I feared to doe it, lest
having beene often terrified
with his Curtaine clamours, I
might rather add to his afflicti∣on,
than insinuate into his affe∣ction.
Therefore to you, O
single Batchelours, and singular
Virgins, I recommend both the
patronage and perusall of these
papers; and the rather, because
in you it can neither breed di∣strust,
nor beget distaste; the
Maides not comming yet to
reade, nor the Young men to be
Auditors. But howsoever I
proclaime this worke free from
all offence, either to the single,
or the double. Marriage is ho∣nourable,
and therefore I say
unto thee, Marrie: feare no∣thing,
Audaces fortuna juvat:

for it may be suspected, if there
were fewer Bachelours there
would be more honest wives;
therefore I say againe, Marry at
all adventure. If thou hast chil∣dren,
thinke them thine owne,
though they be not: thou art
sure to have a wife of thine own,
though the issue be another
mans. Be valiant, feare not
words, they are but wind, and
you live at land, and not at sea:
with which admonishment, and
encouragement withall, I bid
you generously farewell.
