DVtie bindeth, and Affection compelleth me to demonstrate vnto the worlds view, how deepely I stand ingaged vnto your Honor. My debt, I must confesse, is great, and my vnsufficient estate of ever deserving the least fauors which have beene extended vnto mee, vrge the presentation of ELIOSTO vnto you aspect. I desire but your favourable acceptance, and good opinion; wherewith protected, let the envious pursue me with never so virulent, and austere construc∣tions, I shal both contemne their persons, and disdeigne their iudgements. I know my owne worth, and am pri∣vie to their ignorance: where the wise and discreet sit as Censors, there do I presume of favour: But where fooles give in their suppositions, there Ioves pro∣pitiation must be implor'd, vnto whose benediction I commend you euermore.
Your Honours in all dutie:
IOHN HIND.
