SIR,
I Hold it (as I ought) one of the rich mercies of God, that he hath
given me favour in some eyes which have not seen me; but none,
that I know, hath so much demerited me unknown, as your worthy
Familie. Ere therefore you see my face, see my hand willingly proâˆ£fessing
my thankfull obligations. Wherewith may it please you to
accept of this parcel of thoughts, not unlike those fellows of theirs,
whom you have entertained above their desert. These shall present unto you our 
Bountifull Saviour, magnifying his mercies to men in a sweet variety; healing
the Diseased, raising the Dead, casting out the Devil, calling in the Publican, and
shall raise your heart to adore that infinite goodness. Every help to our Devotion
deserves to be precious; so much more, as the decrepit age of the World declines to
an heartlesse coldnesse of Piety. That God to whose Honour these poor Labours are
meant, blesse them in your hands, and from them to all Readers. To his Protection I
heartily commend you, and the Right vertuous Gentlewoman, your worthy Wife,
with all the Pledges of your happy affection, as whom you have deserved to be
