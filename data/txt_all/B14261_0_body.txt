RIGHT HONORABLE, as to the fairest Ornament of this glorious Citty, doe I most humbly dedicate this my small discouery of abuses; wherein is declared some of the hidden euils harboured in the bo∣wels of London, for the which I know your Honour is as ready to finde reformation, as you are willing to heare them re∣ported: for in the first yeare of the Kings Maiesties Reigne (your Lordship being then Shriefe of this Cit∣ty) you made your Visitations in the Sub-vrbs, and out∣places of the Precincts of London, to enquire after euil liuers, and by Iustice stroue to root out iniquity, which good beginning will eternize your glory, and establish prosperity in this worthy Citty.
And no dnubt but your Honours fore-passed care, in comforting the good, and bridling the wicked, hath im∣pressed an inward loue in the hearts of the Commons,
and bred an assurance in your happy proceeding, for it concerneth the prosperity of all our children and kins∣folkes, and a benefite to the whole estate of the youth of this Citty.
I (onely) of zeale in these few sheets of paper, haue discouered vnsufferable faults, but not spoke of the faul∣ty men, whom I referre to your wisedome to be conside∣red of. To your Honours censure do I present this my trauell, and at your commandment my selfe; vowing in the action of a poore Free-man of London, to seeke the good of this famous Citty, and shew my selfe wil∣ling for your Honours imploiment.
