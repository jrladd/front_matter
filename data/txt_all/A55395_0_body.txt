Madam,
WHen I resolved to comply with the desires of some worthy per∣sons in the publication of this discourse, I was not long in suspence about the Dedication, but was speedily determined therein, by calling to remembrance a former obligation to your Honour, under whic I had justly put my self; only I feared, lest, in∣stead of discharging an obligation, I should de∣serve an imputation of presumption and wak∣ness, in thinking to dissolve it by such a trifle. But, Madam, if I should take the measure of my return, from your merit and my duty, per∣adventure I could not have satisfied justice, without a Volume as large as that, which your

Honour and many others know, I am engaged in: Besides, I considered the nature of true goodness and generosity, which looks not so much to the nature of the Present, as the since∣rity of him that tenders it. And, Madam, though the bulk of the discourse is but small, and my managery of it can add no greatness to it, which I confess is such as needs the pardon of a critical Reader, yet I must aver, that the subject of it is truly great, Religion, which hath the great God, and the great Saviour the Lord Iesus for its object, great promises for its en∣couragement, great salvation for its reward. And what Galen said of Physick is more true of Religion, non datur exiguum, there is no∣thing small and trivial in it. And as Reli∣gion is great in it self, so I dare say it is in your Honours eyes, and therefore I am perswa∣ded you will not despise this small Apologie for it: which the miscarriages of former times makes necessary, and the degeneration and ma∣lignity of the present makes seasonable But I must remember I am writing an Epistle to a small Discourse, and I must have a care of making my Gate too wide, lest (as he said) the City should run out of it. Your Honours time

is too pretious for me to rob you of more of it, and my occasions are so urgent that they will scarce allow me to perform civilities. I only add my own, and beg yours, and other truly re∣ligious persons Prayers, that God would bless my poor endeavours. If your Honours name and interest engage others to read it to their good, it will abundantly answer the desires and compensate the pains of,
Madam,
