TO subdiuide Soules indiuisible,
(Being wholy in the whole, and in each part)
For me were more then most impossible,
Though I were Arte it selfe, or more then Arte.
Yet must I make my Soule a Trinitie,
So to diuide the same, betweene you three;
For Vnderstanding, Will, and Memorie,
Makes but one Soule, yet they three Virtues be.
The Vnderstanding being first, I giue
Unto the first; (for Order so doth craue)
And Will (Good-will) the second shall receiue.
Then Memory the last shall euer haue.
And as I part my Soule, my Booke I part
Betwixt you three, that shares my broken hart.
