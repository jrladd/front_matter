ALbeit I may be iustly censu∣red
(most gracious Queen) to
haue committed a two folde
fault in this mine enterprise:
first in vndertaking it, being most vnwor∣thie:
next, in exhibiting it to your High∣nes,
beeing most worthie: I beseech your
roiall patience to heare mine excuse, and
as it may sound with your knowen clemen∣cie,
I may receiue pardon for my boldnes.
To commit the first, I had a two folde in∣couragement,
the occasion of the time, and
a continuall secret instinct vrging mee to

doo mine indeuor in this kinde, not inten∣ding
thereby to preuent anie better able:
To aduenture the second, I was moued by
discretion, namely, to commend the con∣sideration
of it (silly as it is) vnto your
high Maiestie, aboue all others: and that
for two causes, the one, in regard none
hath better power to protect it, beeing in
anie measure worthie: next, none hath
like authoritie to pardon it, being faultie.
And in these regards especially, my most
gracious Soueraigne, dutie and loue being
witnesses of mine inward zeale, I humbly
presume to leaue this my poore offering at
the feet of your most prudent censure.
