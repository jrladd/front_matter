SIR, this Poeme of mine, which I imparted to you, at my be∣ing
with you at your lodging at Lōdon in May last, brought
at length to perfection, (emboldned by your wonted fauors)
I aduenture to make you Patron of. Thus Sir you see I haue
aduentured to the world, with what like or dislike, I know not, if
it please, (which I much doubt of) I pray you then be partaker
of that which I shall esteeme not my least good; if dislike, it shal
lessen some part of my griefe, if it please you to allow but of my
loue: howsoeuer, I pray you accept it as kindly as I offer it, which
though without many protestations, yet (I assure you) with much
desire of your honor. Thus vntil such time as I may in some more
larger measure make knowne my loue to the happy & generous
familie of the Gooderes, (to which I confesse my selfe to be be∣holding
to, for the most part of my education) I wish you al hap∣pinesse.
