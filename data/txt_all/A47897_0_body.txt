My LORD,
YOu have here before your Lordship an Appeal from
Clamour, & Calumny, to your Honour, and Iustice: And
to whom, but to my Right Reverend Diocesan, should
I fly for Protection, and Relief; when Religion, and Good
Manners, (though brought in by Head and Shoulders) are
made the Question! I am Arraigned as a Stickler for Popery;
An Enemy to the Establish'd Church of England; a Slan∣derer
of the London-Clergy; and a Sower of Dissention among
his Majesties Subjects: All which Reproches I Valu'd as my
Glory, so long as I was Wounded for the Churches sake, and
by the Common, and Profess'd Enemies of the True Sons of
That Church, and of All Loyal Subjects. But, I must Con∣fess,
it has given me some Trouble, as well as matter of
Admiration, to see so Unaccountable a Change of Humour, now
of Late, from what it was some Few Years agon: And that the
Same Zeal, under the Same Method of Manage, and Di∣rection;
and for the very Same Cause too; Nay, and the
Self-same Publique Offices, and Applications, that were Ac∣knowledg'd,
and Declar'd to be Meritorious Services, from
the Year 1680. to February 1684/5 should now, all on the
Sudden, be Pronounc'd, so Scandalous, and Offensive to the
Same Protestant Church, which Before they were thought
to have Defended: And All these Contradictions at Last, from
many of the very Same Hands: Where the Fault lyes, is
Submitted to your Lordship to Determine; and whether
the Same Principles; the Same Iudgment; the Same Practi∣ces;
and the Same Doctrine of CIVIL OBEDIENCE,
(for I have gone no further) be not as Warrantable under

the Reign of our Present King, (whom God Preserve) as
they were in the time of his Late Blessed Majesty. If it shall
be said that I have Departed from my Self; I do Freely
Offer-up Seaven or Eight and Forty Years of my Life, to
the Scrutiny. And if upon the Strictest Examination of my
Papers, and Actions, It shall be made Appear, that I am not
the very same Person at This Day, that I was in the First Scot∣tish
Rebellion of 38 and 9. with a respect to the Religion, and
Government, both of Church and State, and without any
Shifting, either of Opinion, or so much as Outward Pretence
in the Interval, I'le Submit to be Concluded by That Instance.
(Though I am persuaded (My Lord) that the Clearest of
my Accusers would be Loth to stand That Test) And This,
(under favour) is not All neither: For there Occurs yet
Another Difficulty, that's as much a Riddle as any of the
Rest; which is, how the Same Person should be so Deadly
an Eye-Sore to the Orthodox Clergy of the Church of Eng∣land;
and yet at the Same Time, (if not in the same Cause)
be so Galling a Thorn in the Sides of the Schismatiques.
With your Lordships Favour, and Patience, for a word
or Two upon This Part of my Case: If I am an Enemy to the
Church, I'me a Friend to the Faction; And yet I find no Abate∣ment
of Malicious Forgeries, and Scandals against me, from
That Quarter: If I'me an Enemy to the Schism, purely for the
Churches sake, I am so far, a Friend to the Church; And it is
yet my Fortune, to meet with as Hard Measure under Colour
of That Interest, as of the Other. Now (my Lord) If my Wri∣tings,
and my Life be All of a piece; (as after all This Noise,
there's not the Least Shadow of a Proof to the Contrary) If both
the One, and the Other have had the Honour, 'till now of
late, of a Fair Interpretation, both as to my Religion, and my
Allegeance: If I do, at This Moment, stand upon the Same
Ground, and Assert the Same Principles that ever I did; there
must be either some Secret Practice, or some Dangerous Mis∣understanding

in the Bus'ness. And the Intrigue is no more then
This; The Common Enemies of the Government, Invent, and
Spread Scandals against the Friends of it. They throw out the
Bait, and here and there an Easy Honest man Swallows it;
while, under That Pretext, the Designs of the Faction are Ex∣pos'd
as the Sense of the Church. (as will be set forth more at
large, in This Following Tract.) Your Lordship has not ta∣ken
Notice, perhaps, that the Author of Iulian the Apostate, is
of late become a Famous Stickler for the Protestant Religion and
the Church-of England as by Law Establish'd, against Popery and
Papists: And that he has Compos'd, and Publish'd Three Famous
Papers upon That Subject: But withall, That as These Three
Papers were Intended for Libells; so they were Manag'd in the
Dark, and Privately Thrown about the Streets, as the most
Pernicious of Libells: And in fine, to Consummate the Bold∣ness,
and the Wickedness of the Hypocrisy, These Papers were
Written, Design'd, and Calculated for the Service of the Rebel∣lion
it self. To say nothing of Other Affronts put upon the
Dignity of the Holy Order, and the Protestant Profession, under
the Same Disguise. It is, Briefly, my Lord, the very Train, and
Master-piece of the Faction, by a Certain Sleight of hand, to get
the Protestant Religion turn'd up Trump: and Then, to Play
their Own Game under it. With Permission (my Lord) This
is the Iust State, and True Measure of the Case, both Publique,
and Private. I had it T'other day from a Person of Great, and
Vnquestionable Honour, That the very Morning after the Re∣bells
Landed at Lime, as they were Discoursing of the Dan∣ger
of their Vndertaking; [Well! (says a Head-Man among
'em) If we can but make a Breakfast of Those Rogues, Jeffreys, and
L'Estrange, we'le never Repent the Hazzards we are to run.]
I take it for an Obligation that they Design'd the Eating of me
in so Good Company: But (with pardon) it seems somewhat with
the most yet, to be Baited by CHRISTIANs, on the One
Hand, and Worry'd by CANNIBALS, on the Other.

It will become me now to Enform your Lordship, in
Excuse of This Confidence, how Unwillingly I came to it.
The Western Rebellion has hardly made more Noise then
my Apostacy to the Church of Rome; and it has given no
small Reputation to the Imposture, that my Enemies have
taken Sanctuary in the Church; and Stabb'd me, even from
behind the Altar: So that I could not so much as Defend
my self, without some sort of Irreverence: And to go fur∣ther,
would have been little less then Sacrilege. It was a
Dangerous, and an Vnkind Dilemma that I was now put up∣on:
Either to Sink for want of a Vindication, or to run the
Risque of Hurting my Mother, in the Attempt of Righting
my self upon some of her Froward Children: Upon This
Consideration, I contented my self with the Middle Course,
of only Touching upon the Point in question now and
then in an Observator: But still, so fast as One Sham went-off,
Another came on; and finding the Work to be End∣less,
I made a Virtue of my Misfortune, and took up a Phi∣losophical
Resolution, of Troubling my Head no further, with
what I could not help. So long as the Fame of my Levity,
and Hypocrisy, Pass'd only from hand to hand, in a News-Letter,
by Word of Mouth, or upon Common Hearsay, I stood
the Shock, without being much Concern'd, whether the
World were Angry, or Pleas'd: Notwithstanding, that
Great Names, and Authoritys were laid hold of, to Bolster-up
the Credit of the Report: But when I came, afterward, to
find Ten Sheets of a Book, Printed, under the Title of
[The Difference between the CHURCH of ENGLAND, and
the CHURCH of ROME, Considered and Stated, according
to such Measures as both do Allow:] The Subject of it, lyable
enough, to stirr up Vnseasonable Heats: And My Self (at
what Hazzard soever) render'd the Occasion of the Contro∣versy;
As if the Treatise, had been only a Defence of the
Church of England, in Reply to the Observator, that had Writ∣ten

against it. This Insinuation was the most Artificial Essay
of Proving me a Papist, that has, as yet, been Offer'd at:
And left only This Choice before me; Either to put Pen to Paper,
in Denial of the Charge, or to Stand Mute, and Confess it.
You will, I hope, My Lord, Easily Excuse my Writing,
under These Circumstances; and as Generously Pardon the Ad∣venture
of This Dedication, when you shall find, how In∣juriously
my Adversaries have Apply'd the Countenance of
your Lordships Power, and Character, toward the Oppressing
of an Innocent Person. Neither have I proceeded thus far,
without Consulting All the Terms of Discretion, Decency,
and Respect: Even to the Degree, of Reasoning my self
into a Full Conviction, that I could not have done Less then
now I do, without being Wanting, both to your Lord∣ship,
and to my self: That is to say; without Appearing
less Sollicitous for the Blessing of your Good Opinion,
then I ought to be.
It is not yet, (My Lord) that I presume to Beg your
Patronage, the Breadth of a Single-Hair, beyond the Merits
of the Cause; and the Exact Truth, and Rigour of an Impar∣tial
Iustice; So that my Petition, within Those Bounds, is
as Good as Granted Before-Hand: But the Sum of my
Humble Request (with Submission) is only This; That I
may have leave to Deposite These Sheets in your Lordships
Hand; To the End, that in case of Any Misrepresentation
of the Matters here in Question, my Accusation, and my De∣fence
may Appear Together. I have now My Lord, only
to Crave your Benediction, upon
