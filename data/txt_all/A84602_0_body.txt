SIR,
WHen Mr, Boyle, with my Partners and my self, attended Your Majesty with the Experiment of Reducing Salt Water into Fresh; Your Majesty seem'd so well pleas'd with an Invention of that Ʋniversal Benefit, That We cannot but with our Humblest Duty, acknowledge Your Gracious Recep∣tion of it; However as Your Great Wisdom and Profound Judg∣ment is not easie to be surpriz'd, and Your Royal Approbation never known to be Your hasty Act of Grace; Your Favour and Patronage was not fully obtain'd, till with the strictest Scrutiny you had first examin'd those Hopes and Probabilities, You vouch saf'd to encourage in us.
But when, upon further consideration, we had obviated all Difficulties, and salv'd all Objections against this Ʋndertaking, (which we hope will appear in this printed Paper,) Your Majesty was graciously pleas'd to give us Your Approbation, and to order us Your Letters Patents, which Grace and Favour (ought to be, and) is receiv'd by us with the deepest sense of our humble Acknowledgments and Gratitude.
And if the Fruits of Your Royal Grant has not hitherto been deriv'd to us, 'tis partly by some Obstacles we met from the sug∣gestions of a private Person, but more especially by the late Hor∣rid Conspiracy, when, not only our Loyal apprehensions for Your Majesties Danger, diverted our Thoughts from all other Concerns, but likewise we judg'd it a part of our Duty not to be pressing on Your Majesties Goodness, or on Your Ministers of State in so Im∣portant
a juncture of Affairs: But having now regain'd Leisure and Freedom after the dissipation of the greatest part of our Fears, We presume a second time to lay these Endeavours at Your Feet, as best Entituled to the Patronage of so great an Ʋndertaking by Your own Subjects, and best able to recommend it to the World by Your Royal Approbation.
This Experiment is in a great degree owing to the Eminent Mr. Boyle, and indeed well worthy so Ingenious a Promoter, be∣ing so much the more the Favourite of his happy Genius, as it is Ʋniversally useful to Mankind; But whatever Advantages this Country, or indeed the World may receive by it, his whole ambi∣tion is bounded in the publick profit, contenting himself with no other Benefit from it, than the satisfaction and pleasure of seeing it accomplish'd by his Friends.
The advantages in regard to Navigation, especially in long Voyages, which are subject (through often Calms, and on several other accounts,) to distress for want of Water, and the benefits to Sea Towns, which are incommodated by Brackish Waters, Toge∣ther with the Easiness, Cheapness and Wholsomness of this pre∣pared Water, are the principal scope of these ensuing Papers, which are Humbly Dedicated to Your Majesties Perusal, Favour, and further Approbation by,
