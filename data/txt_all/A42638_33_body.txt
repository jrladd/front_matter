AMong such as know by experience what demolishing is, Counsel and Advise to Re-build may be welcome; but I cannot pass the remem∣brance of a Fable that several Nations having craved, it might for six weeks time rain good Noses: The Grecians the readiest at hand had their choice, the Romans the next, but the silly Black-Moores (living in remote parts) were the last, and therefore constrained to gather such Noses as had been trod on.
Of those Blacks the Generation still are in esse, and there are certain mali∣cious spirits who make men black, though they be never so white, and though their Noses are as straight as an Arrow, they



will strive to perswade people they were crooked.
But now an Apollo-like Prince, (who casts his most benigne influence on men) is accessible, its time (as the old saying) to make Hay; Re-build therefore as fast as others, what a destroying Age hath de∣molisht, and if in your Building, you want instructions for your Clark; pray let him make use of this Manual heartily Offered by,
Sir,
