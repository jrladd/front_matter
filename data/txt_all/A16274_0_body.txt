DEigne worthy LADY, (Englands happy Muse,
Learnings delight, that all things else exceeds)
To shield from Enuies pawe and times abuse:
The tunefull noates of these our Shepheards reeds.


Sweet is the concord, and the Musicke such
That at it Riuers haue been seene to daunce,
When these Musitians did their sweet Pipes tuch
In silence lay the vales, as in a traunce.


The Satyre stopt his race to heare them sing,
And bright Apollo to these layes hath giuen
So great a gift, that any fauouring
The Shepheards quill, shall with the lights of Heauen


Haue equall fate: Then cherrish these (faire Stem)
So shall they liue by thee, and thou by them.
