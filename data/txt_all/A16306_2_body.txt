BE not displeased with this bold enterprise, as if it
were in fauour of the euill manners of a multitude,
who passe vnder the title of APPRENTISES.
For neither the incorrigibly vicious, who are pestilent to
morall and ciuill vertue; nor the incorrigibly forgetfull
of their betters, whom insolencie maketh odious, haue any
part herein at all. For first, it wholly belongs to such, a∣mong
masters, or Citizens, as are generously disposed, &
worthily qualifide, men who say with Publius Syrus,
Damnum appellandum est cum mala fama lucrū;
and then to such among Apprentises, as resemble Puti∣phars
chaste Ioseph, or Saint Pauls conuerted One∣simus;
yongmen, who say (with Statius Caecilius, in
his Plotius)
Libere seruimus, salua vrbe, atque arce,
meaning by the Citie, and the Citadel, the bodie and the
head of man.
Valete.
