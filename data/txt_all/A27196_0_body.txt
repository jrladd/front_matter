MY LORD,
FOR this Publick Address to Your Grace,
I have no other Plea, than that of a Re∣fugee.
The Muses in all Nations, and
Ages (and long Custom is little less than a claim of
Right) have still been sheltered under the Sanctu∣ary
of HONOUR; nor are Distance,
Height, or Greatness a Bar to those Intruders.
Besides, as WAR and WIT, the Mars and
the Minerva, were both the Offspring of JOVE,
they have some flattering dawn of Hopes from Your
Grace's condescending Goodness; that the same
Hand that wields the rougher Thunder, may, possibly,

not disdain a Reception to the gentler Muses. And
indeed, where should they boldlier intrude, than
where they are the profoundest Homagers? That
Renown, that like Your Grace's, is the fairest
Theam to inspire them, must consequently be the
strongest Charm to attract them. The Dedications
of Poetry are but a part of her Devotion; and
as Devotion under the present establish'd English Li∣berty,
may make her Orizons at what Shrine she
pleases; I hope Your Grace will generously
vouchsafe to pardon so bold a bending Knee before
You.
And indeed, where can all Knees more justly
bend, than to the Heir of that Illustrious FA∣THER,
that quitted all the Jewels of his own
Native Ducal-Coronet, one of the proudst
Wreaths of France, together with a Patrimony,
that might dazle common Eyes, though not so glit∣tering
in his own, as to shade his least Jem in
Heaven for thrice that shining Earth: A Fa∣ther
that resigned even a proud Mareschal's
Staff, for little less than a Pilgrim's. Nay, I
may say, threw over board his whole Load of this
lower World, to lighten his Transport for a
Higher: A Father, to whose, and his whole Fa∣milies
Deathless Memory, and Honour,

our whole Nation owes more than a Humane,
even a Divine Veneration, as lighting Your Glo∣ries
from an Altar-Coal, those Altars, to
which You have sacrificed no less than Your ALL;
left Honours, Inheritance, Hopes, Titles, Digni∣ties,
all behind You; to wander those voluntary na∣ked
Exiles to some remoter, more Hospitable
Colony; with nothing but a Hand and a Heart,
a Soul and a Sword to plant You there.
'Twas thus the embracing BRITANIA flew
with open Arms, to the Reception of those Prince∣ly,
more than welcome Guests to her Bosom: She
look'd upon You, as no less than the flying Gallick
Astraea, that had brought over the whole remain∣ing
Justice and Humanity of Your Native
France, and left her only Oppression, Barba∣rity,
and Rapine, the whole surviving growth of
her Tyranick Soyle. But whilst our ever ho∣noured
SCHONBERG is not only Eng∣land's,
but her great CAESAR's Darling too;
His Royal Favours so confer'd, are not His Grace
but Gratitude: He stands so highly indebted to the
Great SCHONBERGS, those fairest
Fleur de Lis's, planted into its own English
Roses, a FATHER and a BROTHER
both sleeping in the fatal Bed of Honour; those

lovely Lillies died Crimson in His Cause; that all
his most studied Smiles to the Great REMAINS
of that Heroick Root, are but a faint Acknowledge∣ment
of Arrears so Infinite.
But still, my Lord, as much Encouragement
as Your Grace's highest Character and Worth,
and my own Ambition can give me; (for Ambition,
even in the humblest Veins, is the natural warmth
of the Soile; and this little World of humane kind
is but a barren Glebe without it:) Nevertheless, I durst
not have ventur'd to have laid this Trifle at your
Grace's Feet, had not the fairer Merit of the
richer Stock I have grafted upon, the two famous
Poets of the last Age, Beaumont and Fletcher,
the original Parents of Philaster, a little anima∣ted
this Presumption of subscribing my self,
MY LORD,
