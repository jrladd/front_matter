MADAM,
I Present you a Book, com∣pos'd of a Mixture of real Facts and gallant Intrigues. It bears the Name of the Serasquier: In the mean time, this Gene∣ral
is only the Hero of the Romance, My Lord Elector of Ba∣varia being the real Hero. The Glory he has acquir'd at the raising the Siege of Vienna, and the great Actions he did be∣fore Buda, in the fre∣quent Sallies he op∣pos'd, and the several Combats, in which he repell'd the Serasquier, shew that he is ani∣mated with the Blood
of the famous Empe∣ror Rodulphus, one of your Ancestors, who so often made the Ot∣toman Empire trem∣ble. I believed, Ma∣dam, you would be well pleas'd to read in repose the Parti∣cular of so worthy a Brother's glorious A∣ctions, which have given you so many Alarms; and this on∣ly Reason oblig'd me to this Work, to as∣sure
you, that I am, with a most profound Respect,
Madam,
