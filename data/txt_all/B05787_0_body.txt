MADAM,
AT Your Request these ensuing Prayers and Meditations were composed, which I here present to Your view; not that You want my weak Instructions, for You are known to be so good a Proficient in God's School, and have more of this Heavenly Language by Heart, than I can instruct you by Precept.
The Meditations I have taken from the Psalms of that sweet singer of Israel, the Royal Prophet; and this Key opens not only the Kingdom of Grace, but the Kingdom of Hea∣ven too; it being an exact Compo∣sure of all Christian Vertues.
No Worshipping can be more true or more spiritual than the Psalter,
 said with a pure Mind and a hearty Devotion. For David was God's In∣strumet to the Church, teaching and admonishing (as our Duty is to each other) in Psalms and Hymns and spi∣ritual Songs, making melody to the Lord.
In your Voyage to the Almighty, You might have (I doubt not) a bet∣ter Card or Compass to sail by▪ than this Form of Prayer which I prescribe; yet I beseech You encourage others by Your pious Example to feed upon this Milk for Babes, (those which are weak) by tasting of it your Self.
So recommending it to Your Pious Acceptation, wishing You all Happi∣ness that this Earthly Paradise can afford, whist You remain upon Earth, and at the last a Crown of Immor∣ral Glory in the highest Heavens, is the earnest desire of,
Madam,
