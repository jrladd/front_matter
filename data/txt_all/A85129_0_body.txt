THe God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Bless Preserve and keep you, in your faithfulness and obedience to Him∣self, and in your diligent watchful∣ness, and circumspect walking blame∣lessly before him, and lovingly one to another: and the Lord God of life and power settle you, and establish you by his eternal spirit, in the life and Power of Truth, that you may walk before him in love, and grow up into the pure divine excelency, that you may be able to comprehend with all Saints, to know what is the heighth and depth, and length and bredth of the love of God: that you may be comprehended into the infi∣nitness of His incomprehensibleness; and be as a pe∣culiar people, to bring praise to the Lord; and if you be reproached, and reviled, and persecuted for righteousness sake, happy are you: reioyce and be ex∣ceeding glad, for great is your reward. Dear hearts, you that are so accused and slandered, by the Serpent and his seed, walk in wisdom, and blamelesly, and you will feel the pure Joy spring up into your souls, to fill your understandings. Oh! be faithful to the Lord and valiant for the truth! that as Antichrist be∣stirs
himself, seeking to prop and uphold his King∣dom, and to cast out revilings, and false accusations as a mighty floud: so you may be watchful over him in every place, and resist him in the Faith, and be able to stand in the gaps, and so be keptsafe, and be rea∣dy to make war against the Dragon, that in the Lords strength you may be Crowned with victory, and be made to triumph in His strength; and all wait in the measure of the grace of God, to receive wisdom from above, and to be filled with the riches of the grace of God, and so every one to walk as you have received the Lord Jesus, rooted and grounded in him, that the Eternal may rule in you all, that you may be made valiant Souldiers to follow the Lamb, and fear not the rage nor cruelty, of the old Dragon; but stand in the pure Being: and so as you abide in the measure of the grace of God received, you will grow strong and valiant in the Lord, and be able to pass over the deceived, and to withstand the Deceiver; For grea∣ter is he that is in you, than he that is in the world, 1 John 2, 24. So I am with you in the divine Being of love, and you may read my name in the Book of life.
