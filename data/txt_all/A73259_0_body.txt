TO whom Right (Honorable) ought we more iustly to dedi∣cate this Collection of our Cu∣stomes and Priuiledges, then vn∣to your good Lordship, the noble Patron thereof. The Clouds of Differences are now ouerblowne; euerlast∣ingly may the bright Sun-shine of Peace beevpon these Mannors: That their Customes may be as famous, to the Right Honourable Family of the Wentworths, and sought for to be Presidents to o∣thers, as were Solons lawes, which the Senate of Rome sent Deputies to fetch (very neere foure hun∣dred yeeres after the same had beene established at Athens) thereby to frame their twelue Tables. Many happy yeeres (Right Honorable) accom∣pany your Lordships life, vntill eternall Glory, shall make it perpe∣tually blessed.
