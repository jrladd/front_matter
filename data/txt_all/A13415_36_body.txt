RIght Honoured Madame, to your noble view,
These lines of greife, with griefe I dedicate:
Not that I would your cares a fresh renew,
Or any way your sorrowes aggrauate.
Of you put please to reade what I relate,
My hope is, that your grieued heart shall finde
Some things that may your woe extenuate,
And adde some comfort to your care-craz'd minde,
And as you still haue nobly beene inclin'd,
To beare with Christian patience euery crosse:
So be that Vertue still to you combinde,
Supporting you, to vndergoe this losse.
Thus crauing pardon, I the heau'ns implore,
To make your sorrowers lesse, your comfort more.
