GOod Madam, I make bold to present
vnto you a few Toyes of mine owne
trauell, most parte conceiued in I∣talie,
and some of them brought
foorth in England: by which my
imperfections you may see (as in a liuely Mirror)
your owne perfections; and by the follies of my
rechlesse youth, behold plainly the virtues of your
flowring age, hoping your Ladiship wil keep them
as priuately, as I send them vnto you most willing∣ly;
neither doubt I at all, but that your excellent
spirit will iudge graciously of this my bare, yet
bounden Conceit, and to accept the same (as a mean

at ydle times) to driue away that selfe-pleasing,
yet ill-easing humour of neuer glad melancholie:
which spitefull Fortune (seeking, though in vaine,
most iniuriously to insult ouer you) laboureth by
all meanes possible to inflict vpon you, the vertu∣ous
behauiour of your selfe being such, as euen in
the midst of all your crosses, you crosse her designes
with an inuincible hart, and with your honorable
carriage carrie her with all her deuises as a slaue
to follow you, in al your generous and thrice noble
actions, mangre the intricate Laborinth of so ma∣nie
and infinite troubles allotted (most vnworthe∣ly)
vnto you, by the inerreuocable doome of your
too partiall and flitie Destinie. All which not∣withstanding,
you beare and ore-beare with a most
resolute staiednes▪ & a resolued courage of a right
PERCIE, and of a minde A per se. But ad∣ditions
breed suspitions, and faire words (for the
most part) are counted the blazons of flatterie;
wherefore I will leaue to the temperate iudgement
of the wise, and to the vncorrupt censure of the
worthier sort, your heroical & vndaunted mind,
and the integritie and neuer staind proceedings of
your spotlesse selfe. Onely this with submission wil

I say, that if the richnes of the ground is knowne
 the Corne, the daintinesse of the Water by
the sweetenesse of the fish, and the goodnesse of the
tree by the rarenesse of the frutte; then may eue∣rie
man giue a gesse of the internall habit & ex∣celent
qualities of your inward minde, by the out∣ward
behauiour and apparant semblance of your
exceeding chast and more than admirable demea∣nor
in euerie respect. And thus, hoping your Ho∣nour
will as debonairly accept of these trifles, as I
dutifully bequeath them vnto you, and with the
Sun-shining fauour of your gracious aspect deign
to read these few lines: crauing both priuiledge
and pardon for al such faults and defects as shal
happen to be discouered in the same; I humbly de∣uote
my selfe vnto your Ladiships thrice vertuous
and immaculate disposition and commaund what∣soeuer.
Who am
