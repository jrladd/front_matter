MOst gracious Princesse: vouchsafe (I pray you) the remembrance of that blessing, the enioying where∣of (I doubt not) was exceedingly welcome vnto you. And let your fauourable acceptance, pardon the boldnes of the remembrancer, who hauing nothing of his owne, worthy to con∣gratulate your Highnesse comming vnto our Cittie, hath beene glad to take the oportunitie of that gift, which the Lord hath bestowed vpon you, in this great deliuerance, and to present you with the re∣membrance of your owne renewed estate. For as in this deliuerance, whatsoeuer you are, or haue, is newly giuen vnto you: your most renowned Father, and Princely Mother, your louing brethren, and tender sister yourselfe & all: all new gifts, euen newly created; by this great worke of God: so is this remēbrance, a re∣nuing of this great deliuerance, as reuiuing the worke daily vnto you, & prouoking you thereby to answer it in newnes of life. Accept therefore I beseech you (most excellent Lady) the reuiuing of that worke, by which you are that which you are: that so it may further you to that which (by Gods mercy) you shal∣be. And to this end shall my vowes and praiers be re∣nued vnto our God for you, And so I humbly com∣mend your Grace to the grace of God.
