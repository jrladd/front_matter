Most Gracious Soveraign,
THis Treatise prompt∣ing
us with the very
Key, which alone is
able to unlock the Philoso∣phers
Inchanted Castle, I
thought it most fit, that the
same should be presented to
Your most Excellent Maje∣sty,
as the greatest Patron of
all Learning and Ingenuity.
The Philosophers Stone, or
Elixir, hath been always
counted, and is the highest
Secret in Nature, which by

that great Philosopher Mi∣chael
Sendivogius is defi∣ned,
Aurum in Supremum
gradum digestum: the chief
and only means to perform
that digestion, is its appro∣priate
Water extracted out
of that Subject, which is next
of Kin unto that King of
Metals. Concerning which
Subject, how it is brought to
light, and how reduced into
such a wonderful Water,
which hath both power to kill
that King, and to raise him
again to life, yea perfectly to
regenerate and promote him
to an endless life and increase,
the Philosophers have writ∣ten
very obscurely, and strove
rather to hide the Secret,
than to reveal it. Only Bern∣hard
Sendivow, and this

present Treatise, seem the
most candid, to trace us out
the way for to travel through
that Labyrinth of Paraboli∣cal
expressions. Here is the
place set down where to find
the Philosophers Water, here
is the Fire unriddled, which
according to Artephius and
Pontanus is the first Agent,
yea the carrier on and per∣fecter
of the whole Work.
Here are clearer hints given,
concerning the manner of
preparing this great Secret,
than any where else. Here
are the most charitable Ca∣veats
for avoiding of wracks
in this Philosophical Navi∣gation;
which to the end
those of this Nation, that are
studious in this Learning,
may take notice of, I thought

good to fix the same on Your
most Excellent Majesties
Throne, as the highest, emi∣nentest
and most conspicuous
place for all beholders of this
peculiar World: for which
presumption I hope Your
Majesty will most graciously
pardon him, who most hum∣bly
commendeth himself and
his Studies to Your Royal
Majesties most gracious Pa∣tronage
and Protection, and
shall ever pray for Your Ma∣jesties
health, happy conti∣nuance
of Your glorious Go∣vernment,
and all other feli∣cities
both here and here∣after.
