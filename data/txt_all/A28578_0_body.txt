HEaring y'had undertaken to Collect
These scatter'd Papers, which none could Expect,
Should e're in bulk have view'd the World again
But like their Author in the Grave remain,
And wrapt in Flannel under Earth have lain.
A Task so difficult, I durst believe,
(But his own Genius,) none could e're retrive,
Yet those have seen them loose, in their first birth,
Doe know they've nothing lost of native worth.
Therefore I could not choose but entertain
With Joyful welcome this your generous vain,
That raises Harry from the dead again.
'Twas such a kindness to forlorne thoughts,
(Past Expectation) none could e're have brought's,
But such industrious studdies yours have been,
You have in this reviv'd both us and him.
When Songs & Verse, that in their kind were good
By times & fashions, as condemned stood,
For want of polite Phrase, and modern guise
Scarce 'scap'd the Execution, or th' Assize.
Your Brother took them home, and by his Care,
Nurs'd them so well, that still they living are,

He taught them speak so Elegant and true,
Their language Carries them the World quite through,
His Charity in that was great, but now
We all receive the benefit from you.
Like Pilgrims, singly he abroad them sent,
But you have brought them into one Convent.
Where cloyster'd by your care they now shall live,
And when y'are dead your memories revive.
Your Brothers, as their Founder and Instructer,
Yours, as their Quaestor and Chief Benefactor.
As pious works do speak their Founders stories,
These sheets are fixt your Monumental Glories.
