FRom the citie (most gracious Queene) of Con∣stantin, son to Brettish Helen, a very lerned Iew wrotte vnto Britanie to haue Hebrew in∣struction of Christianiiie. And I haue in a lit∣le book comprised for him in few wordes, the gre∣atest matters to stay, Christianes in there groun∣des: & to stay Iewes from longer misbeliefe. And this part, in Ebrem & English for English ma∣trones, I commend, with all that shall come such fro me, to your Graces care & charges. As you are engraffed into the nobilitie of Helens house, the spirituall, reparing of her sonnes towne is a kind of debt layd vpon our nation: and none in the world be so likely to driue thence the Turk, as your Maiesties familie may be thought: layng the Gos∣pell, as Constantin did, the foundation of all suc∣cesse, & teacing the east to take a better Gouver∣nour.
