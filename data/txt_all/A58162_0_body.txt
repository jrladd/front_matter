SIR,
THough I need no o∣ther
Motive to in∣duce
me to present
you with this Col∣lection
of English
Words, but that I
might take occasion publickly to own
my Obligations to you, as well for
your long continued Friendship, as

for the Assistance you have some∣time
afforded me in those Studies to
which I am I think naturally in∣clined,
yet one Circumstance did
more especially lead me to make
choice of you for its Patron; and
that is, that you were the first that
Contributed to it, and indeed the
Person that put me upon it; and
so it being in good measure your
own, I have reason to hope that you
will Favourably accept it. I
confess the Work is so inconside∣rable,
that I am somewhat ashamed
to prefix your name before it, but
having nothing else left of my own,
which I design to trouble the World
with, as not knowing whether I may
live so long as to perfect my intended
Method and History of Plants; I

chuse rather to present you with this,
then lose the Honour of being known to
have such a Friend, or neglect the duty
of making acknowledgments where
they are due, especially having already
made Presents of this Nature to others
of my Friends, which is enough to ex∣cuse
this Dedication intended to no o∣ther
purposes by
Sir,
