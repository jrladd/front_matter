Right Honourable,
HAving, during my being conversant with Forreigne Na∣tions, observed among sundry of their honourable and most usefull establishments that of publick Academies, wherein Lovers of all noble Exercises (as well as of Arts, Sciences, and Langua∣ges) are instructed and improved, without repairing to other parts, & without giving to other Nations the glory and the advantages of their Education. I have bin so much the sooner moved to apply my self to the establishment of such an Academy for the honor and be∣nefit of this Nation, for that it wanted such an advantage, and that the same proved to be so prejudiciall to Sons of honorable Pa∣rents, when they are constrained to travell towards forreigne parts for such improvements, for that they often meet with wic∣ked persons, who doe endeavour to infuse into them most pernici∣ous principles to their native Country; but the most deplorable case of all is, the subversion of their Religion to a worse. And whereas on such just considerations and motives, I have beene moved, to advertise the publique of the advantages offered by the said Academicall Exercises, and to cause publicke Gratis Lectures to be read, first at the Academies Summer Residency at Bednall-Green, and for the Winter Months in this place, where not onely the Fathers of Families, but also the Mothers (mutually interessed in the good educations of their Sonnes) could be more frequently informed of its method. As I thought it not strange, that sundry Ladies of Honour, and other Gentlewomen (though their vocation is not the maintaining of Arguments, and Theses in any Universities, Academies, or Free-Schooles)
would be satisfied by their owne hearing of this Academicall in∣stitution; and this moved me also to cause one Lecture to be read concerning all Languages, Arts, Sciences, and noble Exer∣cises, which is that now by me presented to you; which may inform you at full of all what is meant herein by me, as you will soone perceive; that it doth not only concerne the glory, and good of the Nation in generall, but particularly that of this great and famous City, which ought not to yeeld to any other in the World, and therefore not to be to seeke in the possession of one Academy, when Paris maintaines twelve, besides a number of Universi∣ties, and famous Free Schooles, and that there should not be any more cause nor ground for Paris to pretend unto the dignity of a second Athens then London; since such a Metripolitan of this Land abounds in men of knowledge, and Masters of Arts; who cannot chuse but have one and the selse-same ayme and marke; that which is excellent, honourable, just, necessary, and usefull. May all such as are endued with excellent capasities, joyne to the promotement of what is so really meant by me, and may it be so well understood as that Forreigners may henceforth be moved to come from Salamanca in Spaine, from Padua in Italy, and from Paris in France to this Academy, therein to learne what they have hitherto wanted in theirs; and that find∣ing themselves also in a State wherein by the great mercy of God his sacred Word is expounded in godlinesse and truth; those that have been misled by spirits of delusion may turne unto the best, turne unto God I say, and live unto righteousnesse; and that this may be in your dayes, and during your great Govern∣ment, I shall most fervently pray to God, as one that is sin∣cerely Right Honourable,
From the Academy this 6 of March. 1649.
