GENTLEMEN,
HAving Invented, Composed, Reviewed, Corrected, and Transcribed this Copy of Structures, Figures, Habits, Gestures, Postures, Speeches and Songs, contained in this Day's Triumph (wherein, I hope, I have Copiously accomplished your Commands) I present them to your Judicial Examination, and favourable Approbation, with presumption that I have not at all prevaricated from the Substance of your Subject Matter, or deviated from the Circumstance of your Instructions, alluding to the Honour of my LORD, the Glory of the CITY, and deserved Dignity of this Worship∣ful SOCIETY: And although our Triumphs are clouded with Troubles, and the whole Kingdom is terrified with dismal Expectations; yet the Magnificence and full Grandure of the Magistrate ought to flourish, and bid defiance to Trechery, as the true Method to encourage our Friends and disanimate our Enemies: Which I hope will be confirmed by Providence, who is the Author of peace, Lover of Concord, and Confounder of Cruelty, who will I hope Conserve this City and Company from Desolation and Destruction, accor∣ding to the assidual Wishes and dayly Deprecations of,
GENTLEMEN,
