Most dread Soveraigne,
YOur Maiesties
most Christian
care to suppresse
those rigours,
which some, in
maintenance of
their Sabbath-Doctrines,
had pressed upon this
Church, in these latter dayes; iustly
deserves to be recorded amongst the
principall Monuments of your zeale
and pietie. Of the two great and
publike enemies of Gods holy Wor∣ship,
although prophanenesse, in it
selfe, be the more offensive; yet su∣perstition
is more spreading, and
more quicke of growth. In such a
Church as this, so setled in a con∣stant
practise of Religious Offices,
and so confirmed by godly Canons,
for the performance of the same:
there was no feare, that ever the
Lords Day, (the day appointed
by Gods Church for his publike
service) would have beene over-runne
by the prophane neglect of any
pious duties, on that day required.
Rather the danger was, lest by the
violent torrent of some mens affecti∣ons,
it might have beene ore-flowne
by those superstitions; wherewith,
in imitation of the Iewes, they be∣gan
to charge it: and thereby made
it farre more burdensome to their
christian Brethren, than was the
Sabbath to the Israelites, by the
Law of MOSES. Nor know wee
where they would have staid, had
not your Maiestie been pleased, out
of a tender care of the Churches
safetie, to give a checke to their pro∣ceedings;
in licencing on that day,
those Lawfull Pastimes, which some,
without authority from Gods Word,
or from the practise of Gods Church,
had of late restrained. Yet so it is,
your Maiesties most pious, and most
Christian purpose, hath not found
answerable entertainment; especi∣ally
amongst those men, who have so
long dreamt of a Sabbath day, that
now they will not be perswaded, that
it is a Dreame. For the awakening
of the which, and their reduction to
more sound and sensible counsailes,
(next to my duty to Gods Church,
and your sacred Maiestie) have I
applyed my selfe to compose this
Story; wherein I doubt not but to
shew them, how much they have de∣ceived
both themselves and others,
in making the old Iewish Sabbath,
of equall age and observation with
the Law of Nature: and preaching
their new Sabbath doctrines in the
Church of Christ, with which the
church hath no acquaintance; wher∣in
I doubt not but to shew them, that
by their obstinate resolution, not to
make publication of your Maie∣sties
pleasure, they tacitely con∣demne,
not onely all the Fathers
of the primitive times: the learned
Writers of all Ages, many most
godly Kings and Princes of the for∣mer
dayes, and not few Councels
of chiefe note, and of faith unquesti∣onable:
but even all states of Men,
Nations, and Churches, at this
present, whom they most esteeme.
This makes your Maiesties inte∣rest
so particular in this present Hi∣storie,
that were I not obliged unto
your Maiestie in any neerer bond,
than that of every common Subiect;
it could not be devoted unto any o∣ther,
with so iust propriety. But
being it is the Worke of your Ma∣iesties
servant, and in part, fashi∣oned
at those times▪ which by your
Maiesties leave, were borrowed
from attendance on your sacred per∣son;
your Maiesty hath also all the
rights unto it, of a Lord, and Ma∣ster.
So that according to that Ma∣xime
of the civill Lawes, Quod∣cun{que}
perservum acquiritur, id
domino acquirit uo;Institut. l. 1. tit. . 5. 1. your Ma∣iestie
hath as absolute power to dis∣pose
therof, as of the Author: who is,
Dread Soveraigne,
