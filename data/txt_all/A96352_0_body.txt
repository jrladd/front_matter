RIght Honourable and Right Worshipfull, how∣soever your Command for the publishing of these Impolished and scarce well-digested meditations, pleade my Apologie in this act, both to your selves and to the whole world, to your selves who cannot distike the fulfilling of your owne will, and to the world whe have nothing to blame in my exposing these Imperfect notes to the publique view, but my obedience to your Command (which I was the rather Inforced to yield to in this action, by laying aside and renouncing mine owne will, and Judgement, that I might subscribe to the direction of so high authority, lest I should be pro∣duced as an Instance against mine owne doctrine) notwithstanding it lyes upon me to present both unto you, and to all an account of my grounds and Intentions both in the choice and in the manner of prosecuting this sub∣ject concerning the dignity and power of men in authority. I confesse I might for my Justification here in have recourse to the usuall plea, of the
Correspondency of the argument to the auditory and occasion, but I must freely acknowledge unto you, to whom I owe an account of all my action, that besides this generall respect, other Incident occasions have carried a great stroake in fixing my thoughts upon this Subject above any other.
You may be pleased therefore to understand that a good spare since, the observation of some passages, here at home among our neighbours, begot in me a resolution in my ordinary course of Catechising, among my owne people, to handle and open at large this argument of the pow∣er and authority of Governours as to informe them more fully of that whereof too many of them seeme to be Ignorant, as also to put them in mind of that which was too often forgotten; while I expected to bring this reso∣lution into act, in my ordinary walke, which mine owne bodily Infirmites Interrupted, it fell not in so soone as I expected, I was not only requested, but in a sort Importuned, to supply that roome in which I stood before your Lordships at the last assizes, and by that meanes as I conceived, hastened by Gods hand, to the undertaking of this taske, which had bin too long de∣serred; and because withall some like occurrence in other parts discovered the errors of men in their Carriage towards Governours to be an Epid∣micall disease, I conceived it needfull, not only for the instruction of my owne people, but for the removing of scandall, to proclaime unto the world, that groundles Jealousies, uncharitable Constructions, harsh Censures, unchristian Imprecations, Insolent behaviour, and uncivill Carriage to∣wards such as are in place of authority, are but the fruite of some di∣stemperd passions, of ill governed minds, and not the effects or Issues of any godly dispositions, which being governed by the Spirit, are taught to yield unto all men, the fruits of Love, Peace, long suffering gentlenes, goodnes, and meekenes; and much more towards such as are in autho∣rity, honour, reverence, subjection, and fervent Prayers, for the prospe∣rity of their persons and estates It is easy to observe, that, that dangerous evill of swelling the heart against the higher powers (being the Issue of pride and Atheisme) is nursed up in our private families, wherein un∣dutifull Children and Servants, being unacquainted with bearing the yoke of their owne Masters and Parents, by use of Custome easily take heart, to breake in sunder the bonds of Subjection to publike Governours. Igno∣rance of God and his word, must needs be a great occasion of this mischiefe, and withall, neglect of that private Discipline which was exercised in for∣mer ages, of which we come so far short in these times, that if the succee∣ding generation suffer a decay this way, proportionable to that which wee
find already, it must needs be esteemed a sad presage of a fearfull Confusi∣on to Insue: as the Prophet gives it the symptoms of a state past hope of re∣covery, that the Children shall presume against the antient, and the vile against the honourable, Esay 3.5.
As for my manner of handling so weighty an argument if it be perfor∣med Crassa Minerva, men may be pleased to consider that it was intended for a Sermon, not for a Treatise, a Sermon to be heard, not one (as Lisias said of his oration) not to be passed over often with a curious eye, a Ser∣mon Confin'd in the limit of an hower, in which when many things were to be delivered, it cannot be wondred if that fell out, which is observed to happen in the reedifying of Rome after the Gaules had burnt it, festinatio ade∣mit Curam viros dirigendi, haste occasioned the neglect of art in orde∣ring of the worke: which also inforced the breaking off the very body of the worke it selfe in the middest, as all that heard me know; so that what is now presented to your view may be termed rather mince murorum, as the Poet calls them, then a compleate building, wherein yet if the foundati∣on be firmly laid, I shall have no cause to repent my labour, hoping that some skilfull Architect may be moved by this occasion to take in hand so weigh∣ty a worke, and to raise it up to some larger proportion, and to bring it on to perfection; the same scantnes of time which hindred me both in digesting, and delivering, these abortive meditations, a consideration which might have sufficiently warranted the carrying of them from their birth to the grave of oblivion, will I trust pleade my excuse before all equall minds, against such as may perhaps blame my large unfolding of the duties of o∣bedience, when I throng up the Correlative duties of Governours into a more narrow Roome, seeing they falling into the last place, must of neces∣sity be handled, not as was intended, but as the time permitted. If it be re∣plyed, that men usually take Impression of things as they are presented un∣to them, and consequently that such a manner of pressing the duties of Sub∣jects at large and of Rulers more slightly, may probably breede in Gover∣nours minds a large expectation of reverence and obedience from Subjects, and a slight reguard of their owne Correspondent obligations to them a∣gaine; Let me crave leave to be so Charitable as to hope better things of them, that great Law giver would not beleive that any would be so wic∣ked, as to Commit paracide, and therefore thought it needlesse to make a Law against it. God forbid that any mans eye should be evill because o∣ther mens are good; and that good deserts should breed thoughts and pur∣poses of evill in any heart, much more in such excellent and divine Spirits.
It is the honour of Princes to resemble God, that they hold all men obli∣ged unto them, and yet themselves lie in no mans debt. If it be Regium benefacere & male audire, to doe good when they receive evill, how much more doth it become Princes when they are provoked by Love, observance and patience, to cry out with David, quid Retribuam: or with God, who hath given first and it shall be recompenced? Rom. 11.30. to receive all and pay nothing backe againe (which is the manner of Cheaters and banck∣routs, It is a thought that can as little enter into Princes hearts, as it beseemes their person and places.
I have thus far indeavoured to satisfy your Lordships concerning the oc∣caesion of the choice of the argument handled in this Sermon, and the man∣ner of my prosecution thereof, wherein if any man observing that by-pos∣sage, Concerning some abuse in point of Customes, and wonder that I take occasion by way of digression, to discover my Judgement concerning that evill; he may be pleased to understand, that the groundlesse and foule slanders of shamelesse men who amongst others have charged my selfe in particular, not only with secret incouragements, but with open Justifica∣tions, of all the fraudulent and Indirect courses that are used in those af∣faires, Inforced me to a necessary clearcing of mine owne Innocency, which I conceived might to best advantage be performed publikely, and that in the presents of a thousand witnesses of my owne people, who may testifie the Consonancy of my Apology to that which at other times they had heard more then once out of my owne mouth; of the various Censures that may passe some on the substance of the doctrine, others on the forme of de∣livery, the stile and phrase of speech, and manner of application, a third sore on mine owne person, and the most on my scope and Intention, in un∣dertaking this taske, I am neither altogether regardlesse, nor too much sollicitous. If I say not with the Apostle, 1 Cor. 4.3. I esteeme not to be Judged of mans Judgement, yet I may truly say, that as no humane respect guided mee in the choice of the argument, the deductions of the Conclusions, the formes of expressions, or manner of application, so I see no reason why I should Judge of mine owne worke, altogether according to the Censures and opinions of men, whom if I should study to please, then can I not account my selfe the Servant of Christ, before whom in the sing leresse of my heart having powred out the thoughts of my soule, I leave him to pleade my Apologie before all mens Consciences, in the faith∣full performance of this service in this worke: wherein how farre I have trode under foote all selfe respects, other then such as concerne me as a Mi∣nister
of the Gospell, I appeale to his Judgement, who knows the secrets of all hearts. There remaines no more but my hearty prayers for you all, and for all in authority, for the multiplying of all those graces abundant∣ly on you which may adorne both your persons and places; and make you ac∣cepted of God and honoured of men, that when you have in the feare of God ruled over men on earth, you may receive Crownes and Scepters and Kingdomes that cannot bee shaken hereafter in the highest Hea∣vens.
