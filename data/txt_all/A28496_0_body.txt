Right Honorable,
IT is a very great and signal Truth, that all the works of God are both wonderfull and precious, much sought out by all those that love him: and it is the guilt of the wicked, that as they regard not the Lord, so they consider not the Ope∣ration of his hands; for the Lord hath re∣vealed

his Truth, even his Godhead and his Eternall Power by his Workes,Rom. 1.20 that such as respect him not, in the Creation of the World, and in the wayes of his Provi∣dence, may be without excuse: Now it sems to mee, that the end for which God hath not left himself without a Testimony in Nature, is not onely, that we should in our spirit glorifie him as God and be thankfull,Act. 14.1 but that also our Out∣ward Man should bee made sensible of his goodness, and partake of that sup∣ply of life, which by his appointment the Creature can yeeld unto us, if happi∣ly wee may feel after him and find him therein.Act. 17.27 So that such as respect him not in his wayes of Nature, being careless to seek them out, do make themselves also incapable of the blessings of Nature through their ignorance and neglect of the good things which God hath provi∣ded for them thereby: for all things are Ours, things present and things to come; and Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is aswell as of that which is to come: for as by the act of Faith we are made capable of the good things of the life to come, because by the truth of God, as it is the Object of our Faith, they have a spirituall being and Subsistence in us▪

so by the act of Reason rightly ordered we are made partakers of the benefit of this life, because by the effect of Gods Wisedom and Power in Nature, as they are the Objects of our Reasonable facul∣tie, they have a bodily being and subsi∣stence in us: and as the Wisdom of God doth many wayes manifest it self, not on∣ly in Spirituall, but also in Outward and Bodily things, so there are many parts of Humane Learning▪ some wherof are sub∣servient to the Private life of a single man, some to the comforts and Publick Use of a Societie, and amongst all these parts of Learning, which relate to a Soci∣ety, I can conceive none more profitable in Nature, than that of Husbandry. For whether we reflect upon the first settle∣ment of a Plantation, to prosper it, or up∣on the wealth of a Natiō that is planted, to increase it, this is the Head spring of al the native Commerce & Trading which may bee set afoot therein by any way whatsoever. Now to advance Husbandry either in the production and perfectiō of earthly benefits, or in the management thereof by way of Trading, I know no∣thing more usefull, than to have the knowledg of the Natural History of each Nation advanced & perfected: For as it is evi∣dent,

that except the benefits which God by Nature hath bestowed upon each Country bee known, there can be no Industrie used towards the improve∣ment and Husbandry thereof; so except Husbandry be improved, the industrie of Trading, whereof a Nation is capa∣ble, can neither be advanced or profita∣bly upheld.
There is a twofold body, and a two∣fold life in man, which God hath crea∣ted, the one is Naturall, the other Spiri∣tual, & the Apostle tells us,1 Cor. 15.46. that the Spiri∣tuall is not first, but the Naturall, and after∣ward that which is Spirituall; as the Bodies and lives of men are ordered by God, so we must conceive of the frames of their Societies, that the Naturall is before that which is Spirituall, & that in Gods aime it is a preparatory thereunto; although in the use which men make thereof, this aime is not obtained: for seeing in the wis∣dom of God, the world by wisdome hath not known God;1 Cor. 1. &c. therefore God is pleased by an∣other way which to the World doth seem foo∣lishness, to manifest his Power and his Wis∣dome unto salvation, namely by the Preach∣ing of the Gospel in the name of Iesus Christ, and him crucified; and although hitherto, since the death of Christ, the dispensati∣on

of wisdome hath not yet opened the conduit pipes of Natural Knowledge to cause the souls of men flow forth & par∣take of the life of God therein, by reason of the prevalencie of Sensuall inclinati∣ons, & of the want of due reflection up∣on Christ, in whom alone the perfect use of Nature is brought home to the glory of the Father, by the Spirit, yet when the time of the Restauration of all things, shall come from the presence of him, who will come shortly and will not tarry, then the works of the Devill, whereby he hath brought us, & the whole Creation, under the bondage of Corruption, shall be destroied, & when the Nature & right use of the Creature by his meanes obscu∣red, shall be revealed, then also the pro∣perties and application of the Creature in the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God, shall be subjected unto Grace.
These great and mighty Changes, which God is making in the Earth, do tend to break the yokes of Vanity, and to weaken the Power, which hath wrea∣thed the same upon the necks of the Nations, these Changes seem to me to presage the neer approaches of this Li∣berty, and the advancement of the ways of Learning, whereby the Intellectuall

Cabinets of Nature are opened, and the effects therof discovered, more fully to us, than to former Ages, seem in like man¦ner to prepare a plainer Address unto the right use thereof for us than our fore∣fathers have had: which will be effectuall to the manifestation of Gods Wisdome, Power, and Goodness, when the great promises shall be accomplished, that the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord,Isa. 11.9. He 8.11. as the waters cover the sea, & that we shall be taught of God, from the least to the greatest: and although the Father hath reserved in his own hand the times and sea∣sons, wherin these promises are to be ful∣filled, yet as by the dawning of the day we can know that the Sun is neer ri∣sing, so by the breaking of yoakes & the breaking forth of the meanes of more perfect knowledge, both in Natural and Spiritual things, wee may see the draw∣ing neer of the promises, which will in their own times Constitute the day of Salvation unto all the Earth, wherein all flesh shall see the glory of the Lord together.Isa. 40 5.
The expectation of this day is the hope of Israel; and those that wait for the Lord, and his appearance therein, shall find a plentious redemption; namely such as having this hope purifie them∣selves

that they may be found in peace at his appearing, and such as being solici∣tous to bestow their Talents in their way and generation, to the advance∣ment of his approaching Kingdom, shall approve themselves as faithfull servants to him in that day. Of this Number I am perswaded your Honours are in these Nations as Leading Men; there∣fore I have made bold thus to address my self unto you, and to inscribe this Work unto your Names, that it may see the light under your joint patro∣nage. God hath made You very eminent Instruments to set forward one part of the preparatives of his great Work, the Breaking of our yokes, the other part, which is the Advancement of Spirituall and Natural sanctified Knowledge, your Zeal, I am sure will carry you to coun∣tenance by the wayes which Providence shall open unto You. Therefore I hope it wil not be without acceptance, what in this kind (though but a mean begin∣ning) I have here offered. Your influence upon it, to set forward Learned Endea∣vours of this Nature for a Publick Good may be a blessing unto Posteritie, and your Relations of Eminent note, unto
Ireland, to watch for the good therof,

and to the Universities of Oxford and
Dublin, to countenance all the Meanes of profitable Learning, have encouraged me to make this Dedication; besides the expressions of your Honours wil∣lingness, to favour me in my underta∣kings, which I knew no way so well to resent, as by offering to your Generous Inclinations, the Objects, which are worthy of being considered and set for∣ward in order to a common good. I lookt also somewhat upon the hopefull ap∣pearance of Replanting Ireland shortly, not only by the Adventurers, but hap∣pily by the calling in of exiled Bohemians and other Protestants also, and happi∣ly by the invitation of some well affe∣cted out of the Low Countries, which to advance are thoughts suitable to your noble genius, and to further the setle∣ment thereof, the Naturall History of that Countrie will not bee unfit, but ve∣ry subservient. Thus beseeching the Lord to prosper all your undertakings to the glory of the Kingdom of Christ, I take my leave, and rest unfeignedly
