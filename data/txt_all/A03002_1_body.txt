MADAME.
HErein appeares both the scant∣nes
of my power, hauing no∣thing
of mine owne to present
whom I respect; And the plen∣teousnes
of my desire, rather
borowing of others then be
wanting to the duties of a fer∣uent
affection, neuer so well witnessed but by giuing.
But these English verses are already yours by so ma∣ny
reasons, as without to much wrong I cannot a∣lienate
them to another. First, they be mine, and I
yours; Mine I say, by free gift, and there is no better
title for propriety. Then, they be made at my request,
and by such a one, whose worthines makes him
yours indeede, yea, of good vse too; where alas I
am yours but in vow and idle thought, without ac∣ceptation:
I confesse it to my shame, and the further
from enuy, the nearer to sorrow. Moreouer, since
the rare life, and rarest death of so great a King, writ∣ten

by a Man, was tendered to your Noble Husband;
me thought the complaint for his losse, penned by a
Woman, could be no where so well directed as to
his deere Wife: Finally, that honor of womankinde
(the more feelingly mourning, because besides the
general interest, she was very neere in blood to that
deceased Monarch) being a faire, young, and most ex∣cellent
Lady, of one of the most ancient and Prince∣ly
houses, not of Fraunce only, but of all the world,
claimes to the full as many qualities, in whomsoeuer
her admirable workes must be presented vnto. All
which finding no where els in one only subiect, to∣gether;
nor all, so plentifully, nor euery one, in so
high a degree; I must needes dedicate them to you,
though otherwise (both by desire, vow and affection
to all those you most neerely belong vnto, and to
your selfe) I were not already,
