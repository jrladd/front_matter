CAto of Vtica (as
Plutarch writeth) be∣ing
demaunded whom
he loued best, answe∣red,
his brother then
the other still continuing to aske
him, and who next, he likewise an∣swered,
his brother. And so a∣gaine
the third time, he answe∣red,
his brother. Thrice in like sort
was I ask'd, & yet vnask'd, ask'd of
my selfe, though vnask'd of others,
whether to one or three I would
dedicate this my threefold booke.

To this my self vnto my self made
answere: to whō more fitly should
I dedicate my first booke treating
of Vertue, then to my vertuous
brother? to whom my second of a
Familie, then to my familiar bro∣ther?
to whō my third of Ciuility,
then to my ciuil brother? The con∣sideration
of which points (deare
brother) moued me to present vnto
you alone, and not to three this
Groue of mine, cōformed as nere
as I could, like vnto that golden
groue of the ancient Hesperides.
VVherein I could be said to imi∣tate,
the Philosopher Athenodo∣rus,
who parted with his elder bro∣ther
Zeno all his goods, & gaue
vnto him the one half, for what is
more agreeable to nature, thē that

one brother should to his power
reciprocally aid another? & what
more prodigious, thē that one bro∣ther
should bee a wolfe vnto an∣other?
this plainly and wisely was
specified by the Greeke poet Eu∣ripides,
who said: questionlesse he
that loueth not his brother, loueth
neither him, that begat him, nor
her, that hare. And againe con∣firmed
by Antigone in Sopho∣cles:
I must (quoth she) loue my bro∣ther
better then my sonne, by rea∣son
that hereafter I may very well
haue more sonnes, but, my father
& mother being both dead, neuer
more brethren. Standing, I say,
vpon these termes, & hammering
in my mind on the anuill of our mu∣tuall
loue, I thought it part of my
duty to impart vnto you the iust

halfe of my substāce, nay, in a ma∣ner
all my substance, desiring you
withall, that, euē as a skilful Geo∣metriciā
at the games of Olympus
by the bignesse of Hercules foot
gessed of the stature of his whole
body: so by the outward view of
this my triple treatise, you will
measure the willingnesse of mine
inward mind. As for barking sy∣cophants
and enuious caitifes, to
whose controlling check the very
best of all scholers haue bene sub∣iect,
I passe not for them, namely,
let them make tennis balles of my
bookes, yea, and bandy them quite
away, if they can▪ Onely this is my
wish at this present, that you, most
louing brother, will diligently per∣use
thē ouer, & shelter thē vnder

the vaile of your fauourable cen∣sure.
Almighty God (that I may
now ende) giue you your hearts
Christian contentment, while as a
Pilgrime you remaine in this
earthly groue, & make your mind
pliable and ready for the contem∣plation
of that golden and euerla∣sting
Groue prepared for the
Godly in the world to come. Frō
