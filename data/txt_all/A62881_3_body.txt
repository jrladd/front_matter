MADAM,
ZEAL may be sometimes too Offici∣ous; 'tis therefore with no small Concern that I bring Your Ladyship a Present that may renew Your Grief, with∣out
sufficient Merit to compensate the Tres∣pass.
The Person and Character here Com∣memorated, deserv'd more Embellishments than any single Muse is able to fur∣nish out: Wherefore I pretend not to an Encomium, but an Elegy; being conscious that it was Written and Revis'd with the most tender Sentiments of hearty Sorrow.
It could not possibly be otherwise where the Loss was so deplorable, and my Noble Patron was so great a Sufferer.
Providence was then pleas'd to give Your Ladyship another occasion of Exercising the most difficult of Christian Virtues; but by how much severer was the Tryal the greater is the Tryumph.

Neither was Your Ladyship left destitute of surviving Comforts to alleviate the Losses you sustain'd.
Your Honour has the Happiness of see∣ing (both of immediate and second De∣scent) such flourishing Plants as are, and will be, singular Ornaments to our Nation.
And that Your Ladyship should be per∣mitted to see them All in perfect Growth and Lustre, (and long to enjoy that Sight) may be expected, in Recompence of that extraordinary Prudence, Piety, Cha∣rity and Other Virtues, that have shin'd through the whole Course of Your most Exemplary Life.
'Tis evident, Madam, that you have improv'd the Endowments conferr'd on You, by Religion and Nature, for nobler Ends than Popular Applause.

I shall therefore only beg Your Ac∣ceptance of this Offering, in Memory of the Fair Saint, and Pardon for
Madam,
