My Lord,
ALthough I may seem a stranger to your Person, I am not so to your Worth and Goodnes, which have so generally spread themselves, they are rooted in mens hearts and Affections: As the glory of a City, consists in the Prudence and Magnani∣mity of her Governor; so she ought to be well read and ac∣quainted with his Vertues, whom she chooseth. This be∣gat such Acclamations of joy

at your Election; witness your Honourable Companies, and indeed (I may speak it without Flattery) the Voice and Heart of the whole City; My Lord, these motives have induced or rather encouraged me to make this my Address & Presentati∣on, not dispairing of your graci∣ous Acceptance; since things of this nature have been by use, partly made customary: How∣ever, I hope, the transgression (if any) carries not so ill an A∣spect, but that it may come within the Verge of your Can∣dor, whereby I may be licensed to subscribe my self,
My Lord, Your Honours most Humble and Faithfull Servant,
