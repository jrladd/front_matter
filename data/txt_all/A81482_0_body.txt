AMongst my other Dedi∣cations, I held my self bound to present this poor unpolisht Treatise to your view; The Lord hath given you a very discern∣ing Spirit; you have a choice uncti∣on from Heaven: yet humility emi∣nently crowning all your other Gra∣ces, I know she will not disdaine, but highly prize the labour of those that are faithful. I have formerly received encouragement from you in my work, and you did not de∣spise my youth: This therefore is to shew, that neither time, nor distance
of place, can blot out those characters which the Memory of your Graces, and singular Favours, have imprint∣ed on my heart. The Laws of Per∣sia, Macedonia, and Athens, condemn∣ed the ungrateful to death; and un∣thankfulness may well be stiled the Epitome of vices: 'Tis as oblivious as Messala Corvinus, that forgat his own name. Some that are forgetful of benefits, are tenacious of inju∣ries; the former they write in dust, the latter on marble: But I know your Modesty wishes an end to this discourse. I here lay before you a Treatise of spiritual Opticks, disco∣vering the infirmities of the eye by Nature, with its excellencies attain∣able by Grace. 'Tis a Subject rarely written of; And I never yet could see any Treatise, opening at large, as distinctly, what I here undertake: If I have mingled divine with hu∣mane Observations, the Righteous God knoweth it is; that the latter may (with vulgar Readers) be as
sauce to the former, to make them relish the better: So praying for your daily improvement in Grace; that at last I may see you glister in Eternity, (where our Communion will be renewed) I rest
Madam,
