Honoured Sir, and Virtuous Madam.
I Do sincerely own, and ingeni∣ously Acknowledge my self so highly oblig'd to you both, for your great Kindness and Respect shewn to unworthy me and my Family; since we (Providentially) came (as Pilgrims and Strangers) into England, that I am really concern'd that I can (hitherto) but Reta∣liate in verbal Acknowledgments. The Divine Providence seeing it best for me to keep me low (in outwards) and by that means to render me uncapable of that Du∣ty; which the Care, Pains, and
constant Diligence of an Able and Faithful Physitian obliges to.
It is well known both to your selves and my Friends and Rela∣tions, who were Eye and Ear Witnesses of the near Approaches I made towards the Grave. How that I owe my Life (under God) several times (over and over) to the great Skill, Care, and Faithfulness of Ingenious and Faithful Doctor Tarlass: And I do now own and Acknowledge the same to the Praise of Je∣hova the Great and Chief Physitian, and the deserved Com∣mendation of Doctor Tarlass his worthy Instrument. I hope (dear Sir) I shall be Enabled to carry to the Grave a becom∣ing Remembrance of your Chri∣stian Kindness, and Tender Re∣spect shewn and exprest (on all Occasions) towards the most unworthy of Christs Ambassa∣dors; who, (through special Grace) can say (in truth) that
he prizes and values his present Poverty and Reproach occasion'd by his Love to, and Zeal for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, more than he doth all the Honour and Riches which this vain flat∣tering and bewitching World is capable of advancing to.
And I greatly hope, and sin∣cerely pray, that the ever Bles∣sed God (who hath endowed you with so Excellent a Gift of Un∣derstanding, and discerning the State and Condition of Human Bodies, and of distinguishing be∣tween the manifold and various Maladies and Distempers to which they are obnoxious (even to an Excelling the most of Physitians now in London) and who hath Crown'd your Labours with such Success as bespeaks you preferra∣ble and desirable (above all of your Function) by those Patients who have experienc'd your Skill and Faithfulness: That this ever Blessed God (I say) who hath
done for you what is now men∣tion'd above; what, I am capable of expressing, may prove your spi∣ritual Physitian in that needful Hour, when decaying Nature is breathing out its Ʋltimum Vale to the present World is, and shall be the Prayer and Cordial Wish of your highly oblig'd and thank∣ful Patient; who shall not cease (whatever others think or say of you) to Trumpet out your deser∣ved Fame and real Worth, while I enjoy the Faculties of Memory and Speech. And what I pray, and wish God may be to you in a dying Hour, the same I pray and wish he will be to your dear and Religious Consort, in whom you are so greatly Blest. And for both your sakes (to whom I own my self for ever obliged) I heartily pray, that God may work out for his own (by the effectu∣al Call of his own Spirit) your dear Posterity, that when you are call'd off, and they (by Provi∣dence)
are call'd on the Stage of publick Service; they may be Act∣ted by the same Spirit whereby ye are both Acted; so as their Usefulness in their Day and Place, may render and bespeak them as serviceable and desirable as their Parents, the which if God vouch∣safe them (as I hope he will) they will then live truly Honou∣rable, and die lamented, as I am confident you will whenever you go hence.
My prefixing your worthy Names to the ensuing Treatise will (I hope) be lookt on as a making Amends for my great Deficiency and shortness in Handling so sweet and excellent a Subject; especi∣ally in the Esteem and Judgment of those who have the same va∣lue for you both, as I have. The Method I have taken in owning your Kindness will (I greatly hope) be no way displeasing, see∣ing I know not how otherwise to do it to my own Satisfaction. I
conclude this short Dedication with my hearty well Wishes and Prayer to God for you both; that the Subject of the Appletree (so weak∣ly handled in the ensuing Trea∣tise) may be (through the Pow∣erful Influence of the Holy Ghost in both your Souls) made as de∣lightful to you in reading it, as it was to me in Studying and Preaching it; and as Ravishing as it was to those at whose earnest Request I have been prevailed with to Publish the same. I am (Honoured Sir) and virtuous Madam,
