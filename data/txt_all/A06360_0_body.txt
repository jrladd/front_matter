THE opinion, which vpon diuers occa∣sions you haue
ex∣pressed, you had of the excellencie of this smale worke; and the great
esteeme wherin you kept it alwayes by you in spanish, enboldned my
vnskilfulnes, to bestowe vpon it an English beeing: such
assu∣rance are you able to giue of the worth of whatsoeuer you vn∣dertake
to prise, or prayse. Now if as your word went before the presse, so
it may please you to permitt your noble name to ap∣peare in the Frontispice;
and to take it into such a degree of fa∣uour, as to stand betwixt the Saint
and Censure, I dare promis he will be looked on and liked by the most, yea
euen by the best vn∣derstandings be iudged to speake excellent truthes with
profitt and admiration; and herin you shall still adde to the high rate the
world putts vpon the riches of your mind: which makes you your countries
admiration and pride, and the enuie of other na∣tions, who would iudge it no 
crime to mistake you for one of theirs; did you not by the
fre∣quent and feruent testimonies of your incomparable zeale, loue, and
affection to serue our best King and Countrie, put them out of that dreame.
But what doe I doe? I dare not giue sayle into the Ocean of your vast
soule, which is capable of all things from the highest to the lowest, in
perfection. Not that I dread cen∣sure of flatterie, where euery one is readie
to subscribe, if I could find any end; or to write them∣selues, of they
could find any be∣ginning of your prayses (plentie making vs all poore in
this too plentifull a subiect) But that your obligations haue made me too
much your seruant, to be willing to obscure what I am not able
to illustrate. I will one∣ly therfor, giue my long impri∣soned thoughts
leaue to appeare in words, confessing with all sinceritie and truth, that
for my part, I neuer mett with Ma∣gnanimitie matched with such mildnes:
such admirable know∣ledg accompayned with such hu∣militie: so great
abilitie atten∣ded with such affabilitie: nor so perfect courtshipe in
coniunc∣tion with so great pietie. In a word the Court meets with no∣thing
more polished, more oblig∣ing, more endearing: The Armie with nothing more
generous, re∣solute and vndaunted: The schoole with nothing that ether
makes more deepe and strong cō∣ceptions; or more happie and gracefull
productions. And yet that which is iustly most admi∣red and
beloued in you, is, that that Pietie which you teach the world to practise,
teacheth you to make frequent and faire re∣treates, from thence to a Reli∣gious
Cell or solitude, which seemes indeed to be the Center where your soule
reposeth; and where, being remoued out of the noyse of the world, you
better discerne what God speakes to your hart. Please Noble Sr. to admit
this trifle, as a signe of gratitude; till tyme present something,
whose bulke may be better able to beare your prayses: ād permitt that I,
in the interim, may honor myself with the title of
