SIRS,
ACcording to my promise, and the desire of many Friends, I have taken in hand to give some further Account of the Conference that we had at your House, in June the 3d. 1658. Together with an Examination and Tryal of some few Particulars published by you upon a more mature consideration; But truly I must be very brief, because the Press hath waited a long while for it by reason of my being so much from home, and taken off upon other occasions, for indeed part of my Book hath been print∣ed long since, the which part was far briefer than it was in∣tended if time would have admitted; and also if the man to whom I had Dedicated it (in chief) had been in England, but he being far remote, and also giving forth speeches, that he would not meddle any more with me, either in Disputation, nor in the Press, I did only intend to answer that which seem∣ed most material (unto me) and to remove it from my door, and also to shew my opinion upon some other Subjects, which are material, and worth examination as at this day; at the end of which, I did promise to speak somewhat in order to the reviving of our former Discourse, upon which I did
