Right Worshipfull,
VSuall, and ordinary is your contributary charge to the reliefe of those, that suffer losse by the High-way side (the Law requiring it) great is your care and trou∣ble, almost at euery Session of Assize, in try all of those, who that way offend; seriously to bee lamented is the losse of many young Gentlemen (well descended) who haue beene, for that fact, found guilty, and accor∣dingly suffered, vntimely ignominious, yet deserued deaths; These mischiefes, and inconueniences I haue ob∣serued, and seriously considered; so that (partly to exte∣nuate my owne foule offences, partly to procure ease vnto my burdened conscience, but most especially that the like may not bee hereafter) I haue written this Discouery, which I entitle my Recantation; I haue heereby not onely preuented the baser sort of people from committing such rebellious out-rages, but also laid open to the better sort (I meane too such as are of Gentle Parentage) the foule∣nesse and basenesse of the Act, that who so hath the least rellish of a Gentleman, will be no more sedvced, and that way misled; now if it take this good effect (as I heartily wish it may) I shall account my selfe happy, although I continue still,
