MY LORD,
IN so thicke, and darke an igno∣rance,
as now almost couers the
Age, I craue leaue to stand neare your
light: and, by that, to be read. Poste∣rity
may pay your benefit the honor,
and thanks; when it shall know, that
you dare, in these Iig-giuen times, to

countenance a legitimate Poëme. I
must call it so, against all noise of opi∣nion:
from whose crude, and ayy
reports, I appeale, to that great and
singular faculty of Iudgment in your
Lordship, able to vindicate truth from
error. It is the first (of this race) that e∣uer
I dedicated to any Person, and had
I not thought it the best, it should haue
beene taught a lesse ambition. Now, it
apprcheth your censure chearefully,
and with the same assurance, that In∣nocency
would appeare before a Ma∣gistrate.
