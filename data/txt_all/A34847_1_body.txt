Gentlemen, and Ladies,
IF your serious occasions will permit me so
much honour, that this slight Book may
be accepted and perused, I shall justly ac∣knowledge
the favour to be farre above
either my hopes or merit. And if you ever
vouchsafed your Presence when it was pre∣sented
on the Stage, I am confident, your (no
way erring) judgements will now allow it as
it then was intended, which was, rather to pro∣voke
a laughter, then occasion a contemplation.
It will likewise engage my gratefull service
if I be not (in your worthy opinions) taxt of
Arrogance to present my unpolished lines, when
daily those of excellence are offered to your
Eyes and Ears: But in the confidence of your
clemency, I submit to the verdict of my grand
Iury. And howsoever you are pleased to cen∣sure,
will remain (as I ought) the humblest of
your servants,
