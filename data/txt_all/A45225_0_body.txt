MADAM,
THis Comedy having been admitted to Your Ma∣jesties Eyes, hath leave to throw it self at Your Feet: It was written to Celebrate the BIRTH-DAY of the KING; this gained it that Credit, which it ought to have lost for being mine: It hath been sought at the Festival of Your Majesty; for, in virtue of that Esteem which Your Name gives it,

Men pardon it, the having been Penn'd by me. To this Task I was emboldened by D. Maria de Gusman, believing that a Creature of her Fa∣ther would happen to Serve Your Majesty better with his Obligation, than Others with their Wit; the mistake was just, I do not blame it, nor those who desire to read it, since it had the Honour to be heard by Your Majesty; and it will gain two Plaudits (without deserving one) Your Majesty being now the second time its PATRONESS.
