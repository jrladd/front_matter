MADAM,
THO' I am conscious to my self, that this Discourse appears in publick with far greater Disadvantages, than many other do; a great part of it having been hastily wrote in a tumultuous hurry of Thoughts, and some disor∣der of Passion, upon the Death of my much Esteemed FRIEND: Yet in honour to His Memory, and in complyance with the Requests of many of those worthy Gentlemen who attended His Funeral, and more especially for Your Satisfaction; I have so far prevail'd upon my self, as to dis-regard the Censures that may be pass'd upon it. If it should be thought by some, not worthy the Reading of many,
whose hands it may now fall into; I shall leave Those, whom I much respect, to make their Pro∣mised Apology: That the Will of the Dead could not any way be better fulfill'd, than by Publishing that, which by Monsieur De l'Angle was deny'd to be preach'd.
A sort of French Civility, which I was, till now, as little Acquainted with, as I desire to be with their Government, or Religion. So far as I can learn, 'twas never practis'd amongst Englishmen; and I am sure in the mildest Construction that can be made of it, it must be term'd a most Unseasona∣ble, Ungrateful, and Indiscreet piece of Rudeness. Most Unseasonable certainly at His Funeral, who always Pursued the Things that made for Peace and Love, for Meekness and Charity, for Hospi∣tality and good Neighbourhood: Most Ungrateful to Him, who whilst he was living, had Obliged the Gentleman by several eminent Acts of special Favours and Kindnesses: And most Indiscreet, in respect of the poor French-Protestants, whose ca∣lamitous Condition hath been, by the compassionate Care of Their MAJESTIES, frequently and lately Recommended to the Charity of the whole Nation. So that, if Monsieur De l'Angle had no Regard to the Gentlemen of Berks, yet Pity to his own Countrymen might have moved him, at that time, to abate his Resentment of those words, that an Honourable Member of Parliament, and some
Others upon just Provocation had given him, when he refused to Comply with their Request, under Pretence that he had not been treated as a Gentle∣man; because no particular Messenger had been sent unto him. In the Dispute I know he told them, That I of All Men should not have his Pulpit; but for what Reason, he was not bound to satisfy any Man, nor would he declare. I remember very well, when he stood for his Degrees, I was very Industrious to Oppose his Letter of Petition, because I thought his Request very Unreasonable, and Him∣self Unqualify'd for them. If this were the Reason, (as Some guess'd it to be) and he were sordidly in∣clined to seek Revenge; He might have took some other Opportunity for it, which would have ren∣der'd him less Ridiculous and Odious to Mankind, than this his late Behaviour has done. If that were not the Reason, but (as Others rather Con∣jectur'd) he were Biass'd by a Party to espouse a Quarrel: They may know that it was One of the worst Hands that was ever employ'd to Defend their Honourable Cause: and I believe he Himself will be Convinc'd, (if he be not already) that he ought to be better Rewarded, than I have been for more Civil Services. However Many besides my self have learnt that there are Some, Who, not∣withstanding all their Boasts of Gentility, have little Reputation to Lose, and less Modesty to be Tender of.

I humbly beg Your Pardon, GOOD MADAM, for making mention of this Matter, which, I fear, doth revive and encrease Your Sorrow: But it could not be conceal'd without manifest Injustice to those Many Worthy Gentlemen, who were so ex∣treamly affronted, whilst they were paying their last Respects to Your Late Most Affectionate HUS∣BAND; as well as to My Self, who could not without Great Indecency, decline the Publication of this Sermon, and the Occasion of its Coming forth. Such as it is, I most humbly present it to Your Perusal; beseeching ALMIGHTY GOD, Who comforts those that are cast down, to support You under this sad Stroke of His Providence, so to Bless You, as to make All things work together for Your Good, and to fill You with all Joy and Peace in Believing; till at last You are received into the number of the Blessed, and made Partaker, with them, of Pleasures for evermore. Which is, and shall be the constant Prayer of,
MADAM,
