MOST GRACIOVS PRINCESSE,
Inasmuch as it pleased your most excellent Majesty, to vouchsafe a Gracious eare to the weake vtterance of these medita∣tions, I am comfortablely encouraged to pre∣sent a more compleate discovery of them, to your Princely eyes, not that I account them worthy (as they are myne) of the least looke of Majesty; but trusting who∣ly to that clemency & favour, which I humbly entreate, may thyne from you, vpon this my poore endeavour; it having (next to the honour of the most high God) her only respect, and ayme, at your Majesties present, and furture condition; a true type wher∣of, is here tendered by him, whose soule doth daily sue vnto the King of Kings, that as he hath measured vnto, (and you haue shared with,) Moses, and David, many tribulations in the en∣trance of their honour, and renowne, and after made them so much the more famous, admired, & victorious: So it, might please the same Lord to alott you the sweete happines of their issue, which was most blessed and glorious; to alay the distaste of that bitter beginning, which (vnto nature) seemeth somewhat tarte, and greivous; and together with that peerelesse greatnes
 which they enjoyed on earth, the same glory and joy, which they posesse in heaven. The Great God of heaven and earth blesse, with the richest abundance, & combination of his rarest, and best blessings, your Royall Head, & Husband; your Highnes, all your hopefull Plants, & Princely posterity, that your Crowne may yet flourish, your enemyes may ever pe∣rish, and you all, may be made mirrours of Majesty, and Royalty, to all generations.
