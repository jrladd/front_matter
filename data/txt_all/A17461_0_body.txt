THis day (the eight'h from his Natiuitie)
The glorious Sonne of the Omnipotent
Was Circumcis'de, bearinge mans frailetie,
T'appease the wrath of the Magnificent;
This day, the Sonne of blessed MARY shed
His first deare bloud, to make vs liue b'inge dead.


In memorie whereof this custome takes,
That on the first day of the newe-borne yeare,
Eache freind, vnto his freind some present makes;
Louer to Louer, husband to his pheare:
But I; poore I, that haue no gifte to bringe,
Out of my home-bred Muse these verses singe.
