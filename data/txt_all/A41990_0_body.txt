MADAME
MY wishes to your lady. and Community, are of a most happy
Christ∣masse and to the end they may not prove meere empty ones, that
passe with the breath that con∣vayes them to the eare, they goe accompanied
with a smale trea∣tise, which may helpe to furtherthe
happinesse I wish both you, and them. I present you with The voice of
truth, the An∣gel of peace who giving him∣selfe vnto us, gave the
first happy Christ-masse, and peace on earth to men of good
will. First fruites seldome have their due maturity: yet their beeing
first supplyes this want, & makes them the most acceptable. I hope
these being my first (in this kind) will, if not merit a gratfull
acceptance, at least pleade a gra∣tious pardon for.
