SIR
IT is now twenty years and more, since first I thought that we in England were infinitely out, in our way and Method of educating youth; and although I did attempt something (in the time of our late toubles) toward the redress there∣of;

yet must I acknowledge that my conference with you, hath not only rivetted me in my former perswasi∣on, but much animated and encou∣raged me to reassume my former at∣tempt. And though I find my proposals to be much slighted and contemned in general; yet till some persons of worth and learning, shall by force of argument convince my judgement, I shall not easily be perswaded to de∣sist; but shall hope that there may be yet found some to joyn with you in giving encouragement to such an Honourable undertaking, as is the teaching of youth all the sci∣ences in their own Tongue: An in∣troduction to the last and highest of them, the Art of Logick, I here tender the world under the Pa∣tronage of your name, to let it know as well your zeal for your Country, as my gratitude for the many favours I have received from you: and if at last I can per∣swade

some few to give their children such education in their own tongue, (before they attempt any thing in o∣ther languages) as may in some good measure fit them for all imployments both by Sea and Land, God shall have the Glory, they and their Country the profit; and I in that shall think my self abundantly satisfied for all the pains that I have yet, or shall hereaf∣ter undertake; and the rather, because I hope thereby to make it appear, how much I am▪
