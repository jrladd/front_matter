My LORD,
MY small Endeavours of serving the Publick have met with such repeated Encouragements in Your Illu∣strious Family, that I have im∣patiently waited for a proper Occasion to express my Dutiful Acknowledgments.
Custom, MY LORD, has at all Times justified Dedications, chiefly, perhaps, because Fortune seldom puts it in the Power of a Writer to shew his Gratitude to the Supporters of Learning any

other way: Nevertheless I think it an unpardonable Rudeness in an Author, boldly to obtrude a Book to a Person, that can reap either Pleasure or Benefit by it; and therefore I have delay'd so long to wait upon Your LORD∣SHIP, till the Usefulness of the Present might, in some measure, attone for the Trouble of the Address.
History, My LORD, of all Sciences is that which is the most suitable to all Persons; and which best answers the two main Ends of our Studies, Profit and Delight. But it deserves in a more pecu∣liar manner the Application of those of Your Rank and Dig∣nity; for History is chiefly con∣versant about the Lives and Acti∣ons

of the Illustrious, and since there is a sort of Collateral Affi∣nity between Great Men of all Times and Places, it highly con∣cerns them to be acquainted with one another.
Moreover the Variety of Great Events and Revolutions, the dif∣ferent Laws, Religions and Cu∣stoms, which History presents to our Sight, cannot but yield a very diverting and entertaining Prospect; and the Account it gives us of the several Characters of Men, and of the chief Springs and Motives of their Actions, together with the Good and Bad Examples it sets before us, will certainly go a great way towards the making a Wise and a Pru∣dent Man.
'Tis true, MY LORD, that if Examples suffice to form a Great Man, Your LORDSHIP has no occasion to fetch 'em from abroad; You will find in Your Noble Father alone, a perfect Pattern of Military and Political Virtues: By Him Your LORDSHIP may learn to be both a Soldier and a Statesman; Great at the Head of an Army; Great in Bu∣siness, but still Greater in a wise Retirement; in a Word, to be like Caesar in the Field, the Se∣nate-house and the Closet.
That you may prove such, is the most sincere and constant Wish of
My LORD,
