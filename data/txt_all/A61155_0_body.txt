Right Honourable,
THe severall pieces thus rallied, were never writ in my own po∣wer, or appointment, but I had commonly some juncture of Providence, and something of a Spirit not my own upon me; for I observed I could not write when I would, my Springes, were not in me, nor could I end when I would, till I had finished this Testimony, and for something of God here, I am sure, there is e∣nough of man, of my selfe; Thus is Gods ap∣pearing while we are in the Body, he was in Christs which had no sin, but he is not so in ours which are full of sin.
I have some few things to say, and they ars

things of duty from me, and of truth to you; that God hath filled the story of your life with himselfe, with his Power, Wisdome, and Love, and all that he may be your fulnesse, and that you would glory in the Lord: Let me remind you how you have seen him from Leedes to Bradfoorth, to Wetherby, to York, to Hull, even from Yorkeshire to Lincolneshire, from thence to Naseby, and so through the Conquest of Ci∣ties, Towns, Castles, through so much almost as a Kingdom comes to. And now after all this enter into your rest, even the love of God, the Son of God, and there refresh your selfe in his light, in his glory, in the bosome of his love, there are pleasures for evermore; this is a piece of your coursest worke, to beare the Sword for him who is the Power of God upon Earth, for the punishment of evill doers in the world, the more glorious worke is your Spirituall, where Principalities and Rulers, and Spirituall wic∣kednesse in high places, flesh and bloud are all a∣gainst you, and yet you above them all, in him, through whom you are more than Conquerour, even him that loved you.
Sir, Let it be not your busines only to Con∣quer as a man, but as a Saint, not as a Souldier, but as a Christian, not in the spirit of man but of God. Let not a sin, a lust, a temptation stand more before you in the body, then an enemy in the field: gird on your spirituall Armour, your Shield of faith, your brestplate of righteousnesse, your Sword of the Spirit, your Helmet of Sal∣vation, and put on your white lining, which is the righteousnesse of the Saints, and follow him who rides on the white Horse, in a vesture dipt in the bloud of his sufferings, whose name is the Word of God, and tell me if ever there was Glory like unto this Glory.
I cannot reckon the mighty men of valour in the world, any thing but a worldly glory, which if it dyed not with them, or some ages after them, yet can live no longer than the life of the world, all these things are perishing; but to be a man of the holy Spirit, a man borne of God, a man that wars not after the flesh, a man of the Kingdom of God, as well as of England: Thus you shall live beyond time, and age, and men, and the world; gathered up into the life which is Eternall, and was with the Father.
Sir, Your dwelling now is much in the sha∣dow of death, and amongst the Graves, and there∣fore so live in Christ your life, that you may have one life more then men can kill; men can only kill the man, not the Christian.
Sir, I will not praise you, but blesse God for you, and his Image in you, this will make great men love God, and not themselves; to speake of them as his, not as their own.
Now Sir, so warre, that you may be still a man of peace in the midst of battell, and of com∣passions in the midst of sufferings, never wea∣ring your Laurell without some Olive, that all may know when you act as a Magistrate, and as your selfe, when you act from power, or when from love, from Justice, or when from mercy.
So love, as you may love God and Christ in men, more then men, and the Spirit in any more then the Forme either of Presbytery or Inde∣pendency.
Thus Brethren who can now scarcely love one another because of that, shall love you, and shall learne to love one another from you,
Noble Sir,
