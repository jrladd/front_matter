My Lord,
PRINCE Tachmas, (as will easily appear by viewing his Story) was a Person so full of all sort of
Virtues, and especially of that of Fortitude and Courage, That finding his Life to be so near a Draught of Your Lordships Perfections (as it is possible for any man to have approach'd to, but Your self) excepting in his Misfortunes; I thought I should have injured him as much as his Enemies had done, should I have dedica∣ted his History to any other but Your self. And yet, My Lord, I must freely confess, 'Tis not altogether for this
Prince's sake I make You this Present, but likewise for my own. For being one of that numerous Body of men, that by their own Experience have been taught to know Your Lordships worth, and consequently to venerate it; I was willing to seize upon this occasion, to inform the World that I am wary e∣nough to make choice of an Excellent Patron; and to assure Your Lordship, That You have not confer'd Your Favours upon any man that
can have more grateful Sen∣timents' of them, than I have; or would with a more ready Zeal, be glad to imbrace all opportunities cordially to approve himself,
