My Lord,
ONE Reason
why I dedi∣cate
the fol∣lowing

Discourse to
Your Lordship, is
because by Your great
and undeserved re∣spects,
You have ob∣liged
me to do no
less. How much more
I cannot say, unless
I were able to com∣pute
the value of
Your obligation.
Another Reason,
my Lord, is be∣cause
I could not

but publickly return
Your Lordship thanks,
for minding the Roy∣al
Society of so good
a way, as they are
lately resolved upon,
for the management
of a great part of
their business. Where∣in,
my Lord, I do
more then presume,
that I also speak the
sense of the whole
Society; I think,

not any one except∣ed.
I may with the
same confidence inti∣mate,
my Lord, how
happy they account
themselves, in having
a Person so fit to
preside their Affairs,
as Your Lordship▪
The largeness of Your
Knowledge, the ex∣actness
of Your Judg∣ment,
the evenness

of Your Comport;
being some of those
necessary Qualificati∣ons,
which His Ma∣jesty
had in His eye,
(as right well un∣derstanding
what He
did) when He fixed
His choice upon Your
Lordship.
I know, my Lord,
that there are some
men, who have just
so much understand∣ing,

as only to teach
them how to be am∣bitious:
the flatter∣ing
of whom, is some∣what
like the tick∣ling
of Children, till
they fall a dancing.
But I also know,
that Your Lordship
unconcerneth your self
as much, in what I
even now spake; as
Caesar did himself,
when his Souldiers

began to style him
King. For as he
said, Non Rex, sed
Caesar: so let Your
Lordship be but once
nam'd, and all that
follows, is but a
Tautology to what
You are already known
to be. Your being
President of the Roy∣al
Society, Your be∣ing
the first that was
chosen, and chosen

by so Wise a King;
amounteth to so high
and real a Panegy∣rick
to Your Lord∣ship,
as maketh ver∣bal
ones to be su∣perfluous,
and leaves
them without any
sound.
Whence, my Lord,
I have a third Rea∣son
most naturally e∣mergent;
which is,
that I dare to sub∣mit

my self, as to
what I have here∣after
said, to Your
Lordships Censure.
You being so able,
and just an Arbiter,
betwixt the same and
all those persons there∣in
concern'd; that
You can neither be
deceived, nor corrupt∣ed,
to make a Judg∣ment
in any Point,
to the injury of either.

And truly, my
Lord, were it only
from a principle of
self-interest, yet I could
not desire it should
be otherwise. For
the World, if it
lives, will certainly
grow as much wiser
then it is; as it is
now wiser then it
was heretofore. So
that we have as
little reason, to de∣spise

Antiquity; as
we can have willing∣ness,
that we our
selves should be de∣spised
by Posterity.
Yet some difference
there is to be made;
viz. betwixt those of
all Ages, who have
been modestly igno∣rant;
and those who
have thought, or
pretended, that they
were Omniscient. Or

if knowing and ac∣knowledging
that they
were ignorant; have
yet not been content∣ed
to be so; un∣less,
with as good
manners, as sense,
they did conjure all
Mankind, not to offer
at the knowing any
more then themselves.
Vpon the whole,
my Lord, I desire
not You should be

a Patron, any fur∣ther
then You are
a Judge. For if
this small Essay hath
deserved the least ac∣ceptance,
I am sure,
that in being one,
You will be both.
Whereby, my Lord,
You will not a lit∣tle
nourish and in∣spire
my future en∣deavours
of the like
nature: being ve∣ry

sollicitous to ap∣prove▪
my self,
My Lord,
