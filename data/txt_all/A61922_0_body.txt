SIR,
VErbum Sapienti sat est, is a saying, as equally True, as An∣cient; and therefore I need not (here) use many,
 neither will I, especially at this time, wherein your Serious thoughts are (I presume) more then usually busied in matters of High and Publike concernment, and ought not to be interrupt∣ed with Private, and matters of slight moment. In breif therefore I humbly present to your View and favourable ac∣ceptance, this small Collection of some Remarkable things, chiefly concerning the general Practice of the Common Laws, but more particularly relating to the manner of proceeding used in the Court of the Upper-Bench, observed and taken by mine own
 hand during my constant attend∣ance at that Bar, for some years last past. I was the willinger to give way to this publication, that I might make it more visibly ap∣pear that I am not ashamed of my profession, but dare do something in order thereunto, in this very Age wherein our Laws are so much undervalued and traduced by many, the practicers thereof so much slighted, and the very practice it self is sunk to so low an ebb. And I am humbly bold to fix your name in the Front of it, that I may (in some measure) re∣vive the drooping spirits of many cast down with the sad considerati∣on
 of the uncertain event of things by letting them see that there is not so great cause of doubts and fears, as they timorously phancy, since we are not yet destitute of grave Sages and Fathers of our Laws, men of Wisdome and courage, that are not onely (themselves) ready to appear in their just defence and maintenance, but also to cherish & give encouragement to the honest (though weak) endeavours of the meanest professors thereof.
Sir, in having the happiness to be by birth your Countryman, and almost of the same neighborhood; I am thereby the better known to you, and I receive no small con∣tent
 therein, but more especial∣ly when I consider how much your Country and profession is honored in you, and that you possess so high a place of Dignity, in that very Court where a neer Ancestor of mine (with modesty be it spoken) did for many years sit and dyed a Baron. These things, with my re∣collected thoughts, of those many Civilities I have formerly receiv∣ed from you, do induce me to hope, you will gently pass by the ma∣ny defects: you may (perchance) herein meet withal, and which may (justly) render the Worke unworthy of your approbation or protection, and with such favor
 to entertain it, that I may be (thereby) hereafter emboldened to present you with some other of my labors, that may prove more wor∣thy of you, and may more fully answer the expectation and desires of many.
Inner Temple, Oct. the 20. 1656.
