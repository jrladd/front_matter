WEre there nothing else to proue that the death of the righte∣ous, that is, of euery beleeuing and repentant sinner, is a most excellent blessing of God, euen this were sufficient, that it is pretious in Gods sight. For what can befall to the deare children of God, which is an excellent blessing of his vnto them, if that for one bee not such a blessing, of which he saith, that it is preti∣ous in his sight? Of all terrible things, death seemes most terrible, but it is not so indeed to them that be in Christ, to whom many things happen more bitter and heauy than death it selfe.

This Sermon, being a little enlarged, be∣yond that which was deliuered, in the lat∣ter points of the text, I present vnto you, to whom of right it belongs. It is all that I am able to offer vnto you, in token of my thankfulnesse for the loue and kind∣nesses both of the dead, and of the liuing. Accept it, I beseech you, & reade it at your leisure; and I pray God to blesse this little mite, that it may both further your present comfort, and the saluation of your soule.
