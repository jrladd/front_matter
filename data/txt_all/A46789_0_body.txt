My Lord,
I Waited with some impatience to see that Design accomplished by your Acurate Pen, which is here attemp∣ted now by my weak Hand. Ever since you were pleas'd to Acquaint me with your Intention to Publish something of this Nature, It rais'd my Expectation of your Obliging the World with your Printed Prayers, as you have done with many of your Learned and Seasonable Sermons. But after you had let me know the Rea∣son of Holding your Hand, The same might have stopt mine too, and I should have desisted, Had those Worthy Authors that have thus bestowed their pains, de∣scended to such Particulars, as I thought
 fit for the use of those whom I desire to Serve.
But now that I am Engag'd, My Lord, your Favour shew'd to the Well-meant Performance here, has given me the Bold∣ness of this Dedication. And the Ad∣vancement of such Persons to high Dig∣nity in our Church, as are known so well to Deserve it, Encourages me also to Hope, That the Gracious God hath yet a greater Blessing for us, than our own Demerits give us reason to Expect.
I beg your Fatherly Benediction upon me and my poor Endeavours, who am,
My Lord,
