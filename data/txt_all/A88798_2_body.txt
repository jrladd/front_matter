foote-steps are not knowne, Psal. 77.19.
To this good and great God (from whose Ocean you bor∣row your Streames) I recom∣mend you and all yours, both by Sea and Land, humbly de∣siring him to binde up your Soul in the bundle of Life, to let the blessing of him that was ready to perish come up∣on you (as Job 29.13.) The LORD Register you into the number of those whose bowels yearn to the distressed, whose hands open to the Afflicted,

and whom none is able to re∣ward, but He, who hath most and deserves All, yet is con∣tented with a little in sinceri∣tie, in whom I rest,
