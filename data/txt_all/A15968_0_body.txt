COnsyderyng th manyfolde dueties and aboundant seru¦ce that I owe vnto your good Lordeshyp (ryghte honorable, & my Singulr good Lord) I cā not, but see infinite causes why I chiefely of all others oughte (wyth all chere∣fll and ready endeuoure) to grati∣fye your good Lordshyp by all mea¦nes possyble, and to applye my selfe wholye too thee same, as one that woulde gladly, but cā by no means



able to do accordinglye as hys bon∣dē duette requireth: I cānot, I say, but se & acknowledge my selfe boū∣dē, and not able to doo soche seruice as Iowe, both for the inestimable benefites yt your noble progenitos, and also your good Lordship hath shewed vnto my parentes & prdy∣cessors: & also to my selfe, as to one least able to do anye acceptable ser∣uice, thoughe the wil be at all tymes most ready, In tokē wherof, youre lordship shal at all tymes perceaue, by simple thinges, that my ittel wit shal be able to inunt that yf myne harte coulde do you any seruyce: no labour or trauayle shulde witholde me frō doynge my duetie & that yf busy labour & yt hert myght be able to paye the dutye that loue oweth: your lordshyp shulde in no poīt fyn¦de me ingrate or vnthākful. And to declare this my redye wyll: I haue dedicated vnto your name, thys lit∣tle



treatyse, whyche after I had per∣used and by thaduise of others (bet¦ter learned then my self) determined to put it in printe, that the noble fa∣me of so worthy a Knighte, as was thee Auctor hereof, Syr Thomas Wyat, shuld not perish but remay∣ne as wel for hys syngulr learnīg, as valiant dedes in necyal fates: I thought that I could not find a more worthy patron for soch a mās worke then your Lordship, whō I haue alwayes knowen to be of so godlye a zeale, to thee furtheraunce of gods holy & a secret gospel, most humbly bsechynge your good Lor¦deshippe, herin to accepte my good wyll, and too esteme me as one that wissheth vnto the same al honour, healthe, and prosperous successe.
AMEN.
