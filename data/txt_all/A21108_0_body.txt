COnsidering, (Right Honoura∣ble) and not without griefe of mind, & sorrow of heart, view∣ing the great miserie & encom∣brance of this our goodly coun∣trie, the Countrie of England (which heretofore admirably flourished in plen∣tie & prosperitie) by reason of the excessiue mul∣titude of people, which therein at this present doe swarme and superabound, the many faire Op∣portunities which God, in his gracious Proui∣dence, often hath, and at this instant doth offer vnto it, for a present, a speedie, and an infallible

remedie thereof: and yet the notorious neglect and wayward vnwillingnes of the people of this Land, our English Nation, to regard and accept such Offers, and to seeke and take their own good: I thought I might doe a worke worth the labour, and (in all likely hood) gratefull and vsefull to my Country and Countrimen, to write something, (and the rather, for that none that I know, hath yet trauelled this way) that might stirre and encou∣rage them, specially the common and meaner sort of them, as whom chiefly, and most of all it doth concerne, to make better vse of these faire, wor∣thy and necessary opportunities.
Whereupon I haue in a plaine and familiar man∣ner, (as one that intended to submit himselfe to the capacitie and vnderstanding, euen of the mea∣nest,The summe of he whole Treatise. for whom specially this my labour I inten∣ded.) First, declared and iustified these kinde of Attempts, Plantations, to tend notably to the glory of Almightie God, the enlargement of the Kings Maiesties Dominions, and the manifold and inestimable benefit of this whole Land, the Realme of England; and to bee in their owne na∣ture lawfull and iust, ancient and vsuall. Second∣ly, I haue shewed some particular meanes, or in∣feriour courses, how and whereby, both men and

money, the two principall things that must plen∣tifully be had for Plantations, may easily and speedily be raised and procured in and out of our Land for this purpose. And thirdly, I haue giuen and set downe some particular Instructions and obseruations touching these Actions, not vnwor∣thy happely the Notion and Consideration of many such as yet are little acquainted with them; and added some speciall Motiues, for a present Plantation in New-found-Land, before and aboue any other place of Plantation yet attempted. Withal, in euery of these passages, I haue answered all such, either reall (or rather Regionall) or personall Obiections, as commonly are made against the en∣terprizes themselues, why they should not be re∣garded, or by persons that should employ them∣selues in the enterprizes, why they should not ad∣uenture therein?
These plaine, but I hope plausible and profitable Labours of mine, I am bold, and humbly desire your Lordships both, that I may be bold to pre∣sent to the open view and consideration of this Land, vnder the Patronage & protection of your Honourable Names: The one of you being my much & worthily honoured Diocesan; the other my worthy and fauourable Patron: both speciall

Fautours of all good Learning, and furtherers of all goodly Indeuours; and therefore, such as I hope and presume will vouchsafe these Labours of mine, and these worthy, pious, and religious (if they be worthily, piously, & religiously handled) these notable Attempts, and for our Land at this present most necessarie and expedient, your best furtherance and countenance: not doubting but that thereby both my Indeuours shall the better be respected and receiued, and the Actions them∣selues the more aduanced and followed, I shall be shielded from the malicious enuie of the carping Cauiller, that takes more delight, and can be con∣tent to bestow more labor and time in deprauing what others haue done, then in setting forth and publishing, I say not any better, but any like and as good of his owne: and they (the Actions) shall be shrowded from the canine vnkindnesse of those lazie Lurdans that will neither take the good of them themselues, nor suffer, by their good will, any other to doe it.
One reason more particular hath moued me to tender to your Lordships these my Labours, and that is, for that the one of you is resident in that Citie, as in his proper and Episcopal Sea: the other in the next neighboring both Citie and Country,

which either by it selfe in generall, or by a cer∣taine number of the worshipfull Citizens thereof, in particular, hath alreadie begun, and at this pre∣sent continueth a Plantation in New-found-Land: which I therefore hope will be an occasion that may moue your good Lordships both, this way to doe to the Places of your owne aboad (which truly by reason of the number of people, where∣with they are cloyed and ouerlaid, doe as greatly need these helps, as any Cities or Counties in Eng∣land) much good and benefit. Which thing, I am perswaded, you may easily and greatly effect, if you will be pleased, but to shew your selues in countenancing and assisting me and others, that doe and will employ our selues in them, to ap∣proue and fauour, to allow and like of these kind of Labours and Indeuours, and namely, that wherein your owne people and so neere Neigh∣bours are alreadie so farre interessed and pro∣ceeded.
The Lord Iesus, the high Bishop of our Soules, vouchsafe vnto your Lordships, whom he hath called to be Principall Pastors in this his Church of England, such plentifull store of his Hea∣uenly gifts, and so guide you by his Holy Spirit,

that you may sincerely set forth his Gospel, and seeke his Glory in this World, and in the World to come be crowned by him with Celestiall and eternall Glorie. Amen.
