MY LORD,
I Was just send∣ing
away the
last sheets of
the ensuing
plain discourse to the
Press, when the news

came of your being made
Bishop of this Diocess:
I was exceedingly trans∣ported
with the tidings
of so great a blessing
befaln this part of the
Church, and could not
restrain my joy from
running out into this
Application & Address,
which I intend not so
much to congratulate
your new Dignity, as
the happiness of Us,
your Clergy, and this

whole People, in the
relation we now have to
so excellent a person.
Your Lordships wis∣dom,
justice, piety,
and diligence have
made themselves so e∣minent
in the long con∣tinued,
happy, and ap∣plauded
Government of
one of the most famous
Vniversities of the
world, that we confi∣dently
promise our
selves great felicities

from the Paternal Pre∣sidency
and Authority
of such an experienced
Governour; And I be∣lieve
there is not a con∣cern'd
man, who is sen∣sible
of the advantages
of good order, but bles∣seth
God and the King
for so gracious and de∣sirable
an Election.
This, My Lord, I
might speak upon the
publick Fame of your
known merits, but be∣sides

that I have had
particular experience of
your wisdom and can∣dour,
which gives me
a greater passion to de∣clare
the veneration I
have for you; and I wish
I could do it in a way
sutable to your great
worth, and mine own
resentments of it; but
instead of a proper te∣stimony,
I must beg your
Lordship to accept of a
sincere one; and such

I here make you in this
small offering, the slen∣der
First-fruits of your
Diocess.
The Discourse I first
design'd only for the use
of my own people, but I
knew not how to get
transcribed Copies e∣nough
for them; and I
consider'd too many o∣thers
needed some such
exhortation, as well as
those of my particular
Charge, and therefore

thought that this little
Essay might not be
wholly useless to the
Publick. I have writ it
in a plain and unheed∣ed
style, because I judg
such most fit for practi∣cal
matters, especially
in applications to the
populace; and take it
for an establisht, eter∣nal
Rule for such Ad∣dresses,
whether by
preaching or writing,
that they should be per∣formed

in the way that
is most easie and natu∣ral;
and nothing ought
to be studied in the
language for such occa∣sions,
but how to ex∣press
the matter most
sutably and plainly.
But I need not have
made this Apologie to
your Lordship, who
know, That good sense
in an easie and proper
phrase is for ever the
truest and best elo∣quence:

There is more
cause I should crave
your pardon for prefix∣ing
your Lordships name
before a discourse of so
many other imperfecti∣ons:
This, my Lord, I
do, and have this to
plead for the obtaining
it, that I was transpor∣ted
by the occasion and
the desire I have to
make known how happy
I esteem this Diocess
in so venerable a Pre∣late;

and how much
particularly I am re∣joyced
at this welcome
Providence, being
Right Reverend Father,
