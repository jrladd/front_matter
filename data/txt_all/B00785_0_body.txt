Right worthy and Worshipfull,
I Have no better way to shew my thankefull re∣membrance of your love and care over me, then by sending you my thoughts, that is, a fewe of my better Meditations, writ∣ten for mine owne use, and per∣haps not worthy your accep∣tance: yet such as they are, I hope they will finde the same favour with you, that my selfe have done: which though it bee too much for me to expect, yet I can hope for no lesse, in regard of the gentlenesse of your nature, and
forwardnes to respect me, before I had time to deserve of you. The thing I aimed at in them, was to make the Storie they belong to, as orderly, as it is perfect: so that if they have no other use, they may stand in stead of an harmony to right any doubt about our Sa∣viours sufferings. As for Devoti∣on, which I desired to stirre up in my selfe and others by them, it could not bee bestowed upon a better subject: howbeit, if ha∣ving the best I have fail'd, or my affections want heate of zeale; I hope nevertheles, that my sparke may kindle a greater fire, where it findes sewell, by the light of which, many may both see, and bee warmed. And now I have brought my worke to the fire, you may doe to it as you please; for I put it into your hands, desi∣ring
pardon for my boldnes, and so ending, with my daily pray∣ers for your daily encrease in all things that may make you an happie Governour of the Society you are in, or may rise to.
