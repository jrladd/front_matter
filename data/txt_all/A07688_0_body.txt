RIght worshipfull, when I had of∣ten considered the great errors, and by error the great losse comming to this Citie, in mea∣suring of Timber after the com∣mon wayes; and had long ex∣pected some mans indeuour for redresse, but saw none: I was in a sort prouoked (though the vnfittest of a number) to attempt this thing. And because it is not otherwise likely, but that I in this case, shall haue ma∣ny opposers: I haue therefore emboldned my selfe, humbly to desire your worships protection: crauing also your fauourable acceptance, of this my poore labour; that so it may be the better accepted for the common good.
Neither is my desire, only to entreate your worships fauour and protection, but also to testifie my dutifull thankfulnes for your great paines and no small cost, in
publishing in our English  Euclide Elements of Geometrie. A booke, from which  well may, so my selfe needes must confesse, that I haue receiued all that little insight in Geometry, which I haue at∣tained vnto. Yea such is that booke (as I may well say) that if mens tongues should be silent, yet their acti∣ons would not spare, plainly to declare the worthines thereof, to the praise of your labours. And thus in all duetie, crauing your worships protection of  small fruite of your owne labours; crauing also pardon for my boldnesse, I humbly take my leaue: desiring God to blesse and keepe you in all good estate, to the glorie of his name, the benefit of the Common-wealth, and the good of your selfe, in this life and the next.
