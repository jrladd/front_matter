MADAM,
AT such times as your silent Authority gave me leave to want better employ∣ment, this trifle (that now begs to live a Shrub under the secure shade of Your Patronage) was sinn'd into English; and though, not to confesse the presump∣tion, be to add to it, yet its being born in your Honours service, bids me hope it lesse rudeness, thus to throw it self at your feet, than to disclaim the priviledg of being Yours. Madam, I am not ignorant (if You descend to the perusal of this humble Toy) that You must force Your Sublime thoughts (which usuallie flie at fair Quar∣ries) to a stooping: but as the Sun (who is the clearest Emblem of Your Vertues) when mounted to his Meridian, does not disdain to look downwards; so if You vouchsafe to let fall the beams of a Smile upon this Piece, and bid it live, how un∣kindlie others may use it shall never be placed among the fears of.
MADAM,
