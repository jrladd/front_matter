SAint Paul cannot re-ascend to Heaven, before he gives you also a salute: My Lord, your Father, having been so great a Light, and a Star of the highest magnitude in the Fir∣mament of the Church.
If you please to goe along with him in this his Progresse, by the guidance of this Discourse, you shall discover many things that are not vulgar, by a curious mixture of Church and State affaires: You shall feele herein the pulse of Italy, how it beates at this time, since the beginning of these late warres 'twixt the Pope and some Princes, with the grounds, procedure, and successe of the said warres, together with the interest and grievances, pretences and quarrels of every Prince against Rome.
I must confesse, my Genius hath often prompted me, that I was never cut out for a Translater, there being a kinde of servility therein: For it must needs be somewhat tedious to one that hath any free-borne thoughts, and genuine conceptions of his owne (whereof I have a few, though poore ones) to enchaine himselfe to the sense of another. Moreover, Translations at the best, specially in Languages which have an advantage one of the other, as the Italian hath of the English, which may be said to differ as Silke doth from Clotb, the common weare of both Countries where they are spoken, though Cloth be the more substan∣tiall (as the English, by reason 'tis so knot∣ted with consonants, is more sinewy and stronger then the Italian) yet Silke is the smoother and sliker: I say, Translations are like the wrong side of a Turkey Carpet, which is fuller of thrummes and knots, and not so eeven as the right side. Or I may say, Translations are like Wines (as I speake elsewhere) t'ane off the Lees, and powred into other vessels, which must needs lose

something of their first strength and brisk∣nesse, which in the powring (or passage ra∣ther) evaporates into ayre.
Touching this present Translation, I may say, it is a thing I did, when I did nothing; 'twas to finde something to passe away the slow houres of this sad condition of impri∣sonment, wherein I have been so long plung'd. I pray take this as a small token of the true respects I owe you, and to my noble Lady, whose hands I humbly kisse, wishing you both, as the season invites me, with a good New-yeare (which begins but now in Law) a holy Lent, and a healthfull Spring.
Fleet 25. of March.
