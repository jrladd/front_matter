My Lord,
YOƲR Approbation of this Ser∣mon, when it came from the Pulpit, gives me Confidence to Present it to your Lordship, now it comes from
 the Press, what had the Honour of your Acceptation when it was Private, humbly claims your Patronage now it is Publick; I should not however Presume to Prefix your Lordships great Name to this mean Discourse, did not your Goodness dispose you to accept of a mean Offering, especially when it comes as the Expression of a grateful Heart; al∣though I am sensible, your Lordship is so far from being taken with Flattery, that you cannot bear to hear your Due; yet I cannot but Congratulate your Lordships hearty Zeal, and indefati∣gable Industry, in that high Orb, in which you Act, for the Support of that Government, which God by a Train of Remarkable Providences hath Established among us!

May your Lordship Live, to see it fixt upon such solid Foundations, that it may never so much as shake, much less tumble down.
My Lord, I have one Advantage by this Dedication, which I confess I am fond of; that is, an Opportunity to give your Lordship a publick Acknowledgment, for the great Obligations you have laid on me, and to let the World know how much I value my self on the Character of
My Lord,
