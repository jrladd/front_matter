My LORD:
THis plain Discourse oc∣casioned
by the late Fu∣nerals
of your No∣ble
Brother, was
then Preached and is now Publish∣ed
by your Honours desire, which
shall ever have with me the authority
and efficacy of a command.
Since I am sure it was not any thing
extraordinary in the Sermon
which might enduce you to desire the
Impression of it, I have good reason
to believe it was upon a double com∣mendable
design.


The one of Brotherly affection,
that hereby you might preserve his me∣mory
who is gone to the Land of Ob∣livion.
Nor do I wonder at your re∣gard
of his memory, when I behold
your respect to his Posterity. Those
three noble Ladies who (I am confi∣dent)
will never want the care of a Fa∣ther,
and the love of a Mother,
whilst your Honour and your thrice
noble Lady survive.
The other of Piety and Religion,
that this Sermon may be as a continu∣ed
memoriall of him; so a frequent
Monitour to you of your fraile and
dying condition. No thoughts or
discourses are more unwellcome for
the most part to men in their flourish∣ing
prosperity, then those of their



perishing Mortality. Skeletons,
Deaths heads, and Funerall Ser∣mons,
are rarely to be found at the Pa∣laces,
on the Tables, in the Libra∣ries,
of great personages, who being set
upon the Pinacle of Honour, cannot
endure to look downward upon the
pit of corruption. They are but few,
very few,Ps. 23. 4, 5. who when their table is pre∣pared,
their head annointed
with oyl, and their cup runs o∣ver,
with David, put themselves in
mind, or love to be put in mind of walk∣ing
through the valley of the
shadow of death.
Of this small number your Lord∣ship
may be justly reckoned one; else
you would not have desired to read
what you heard. And since you seem to in∣tend



the Sermon as a memento of
your death, it will not, I presume, offend
your Honour, that the Epistle be a
remembrancer to you of an exemplary life.
The Hebrew noun  which signifieth
glory, cometh from the verb  which
signifieth to be heavy: with which agree∣eth
that of the Latins, honos onus,
honour is a burden. Of this I trust
your Lordship is sensible, that as di∣vine
providence hath advanced
you to eminent dignity; so divine
command requireth of you proporti∣onable
duty, that by how much the
greater you are, you ought to be
so much the better; and as God
hath devolved the Honour upon you;
you must endeavour to honour him,
your self, your Family, by magnifi∣cent

and heroick actions of Religi∣on,
Justice, and Mercy, every remem∣bring
that Nobles are placed by God
in this world, not as Statues in a
Garden, or Pictures in a Gallery;
only to be looked upon, but as Pillars in
a house, to support the Church and
State, where they live, and as stars in
the Heavens, to let the light of
their good works shine before
men, from the severall Orbes, wherein
they are fixed.
But I shall not need to enlarge on
this Subject, which is (I trust already)
your Lordships study and practice,
and therefore after the returne of
my humble thankes for your Noble
favours; I shall betake my self to my ear∣nest
Prayers, that you may have increase



of grace as well as honour, that you
may grow in favour with God & Man,
by being a choice instrument of his glory,
and the publick good. Finally, That as
you have the blessings of wisdomes left
hand, riches and honours, so you
may have that of her right hand,
length of daies, confer'd on your own
Noble Person, your deservedly belov∣ed
and honoured Lady, your hopefull
Son and Heir, with those tender
Plants the remains of your deceas∣ed
Brother, and all your Honoura∣ble
Relations, till you all in a good
old age arrive at the fruition of a
blessed Eternity. So prayeth
My Lord,
