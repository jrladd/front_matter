Most dear friends and fellow-pupils;
I Here present unto you a descri∣ption of our Tutour, as it was taken in short-hand. I be∣leeve that Mr Smith (to∣wards the end of whose Sermon this was in∣serted) would have been persuaded to have printed this whole Sermon, if M Moor's executours had not told him, how they ob∣served, that in such discourses the onely thing regarded by the Reader is the life of the person, especially in these times, wherein few minde any thing but news.
I remember that when our Tutour had read over a book writ by D H. he said, That if he had been to write a tract on that subject, he would have said the same things with that authour. And therefore I here make bold to send you

also the last words of Dr Hammond, which are newly come to my hands, because I have heard some (who were intimate with them both) say, that they knew no men more like in judgement and temper then M▪ Moor and that holy personage: So that if you desire our Tutours works, you may be pleased to read this Doctours, till his shall be published; which I hope some of his pupills will do ere long, and not leave all the toyl to Mr Smith.
I have transcribed many of them, but am leaving England; and so must com∣mend them to you, and you to God: beseech∣ing you to pray for me, and to look upon these not onely as the last words of my Tu∣tour and Dr Hammond, but of me also, unless you hear further from the unworthi∣est of your fellow-pupills,

Middle-Temple, May 8. Anno CAROLI II. 12o.
