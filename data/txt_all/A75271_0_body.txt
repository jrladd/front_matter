Right Honourable:
THough in these last ages Vice hath beene esteemed above Ver∣tue, and men have made it their businesse to advance their for∣tunes by wicked means; yet if we looke backe to former ages, and the time of Hermes Trisme∣gistus, who is said to be Moses, and so called from his being hid amongst the Reeds in the waters; and as he was called Hermes Trismegistus, he stiles himselfe the thrice great Interpreter, as ha∣ving three parts of the Philosophy of the whole world (as may appeare in his Smaragdine Table fol∣lowing; out of which all moderne Philosophers grounded their discourses, and bookes:) thus hee might stile himselfe, being allowed familiarity with his Creator. From him likewise we had our first Re∣cord for the Creation of the world, and all things

therein: we shall finde, and be satisfied in judgement, that true honour proceeded, and was at first derived from Vertue; and what man yet ever lived, who was accounted or esteemed so Virtuous, Wise, Good, and Rich, as those who had the true knowledge of Natu∣rall Philosophy, and her secret operations, which from age to age, for many ages, was by word of mouth delivered by one to another, wherby many Shepheards, Heardsmen, Husbandmen, and others of like quality (by Gods especiall favour) became great Princes, Go∣vernours, and Rulers over the people upon Earth, be∣ing thereby enabled to advance themselves to what Riches and treasure they pleased, (as will appeare by the ensuing Treatises,) without robbing or taxing the people of their Countries under their Government in any sort; who also by their Physicall Medicine con∣tinued length of dayes, youth, and strength; by which means those old men mentioned in the Old Testa∣ment, with many other Philosophers, were not only so long preserved from the Grave, but also thereby wrought many miracles, to the wonder of the world: as well they might, having the power and dispose of the greatest Treasure, and highest Secret that ever Almighty God revealed to mortall man. And being fully satisfied of your Honours most Noble and Inge∣nious inclination and love to the study of this most Divine and Mysterious Art, which can proceed from no other then a right Noble and Vertuous disposition, and by a Divine instinct: Nor is a man of any other temper fit for the study or knowledge thereof. And considering of a person of Honour, fit for the presen∣tation of these Treatises, well weighing your Honours

inclination, vertuous Disposition, and mature Judge∣ment, holding my selfe obliged to be serviceable to my power, to all faithfull students in this most sacred Art, have fixed upon your Honour, as most worthy of the presentation not only of these my present endea∣vours, but also of such others as I shall ere long pro∣duce concerning either this or any other subject; not desiring Patronage, as is usuall, (considering the Per∣sons by whom these Treatises were first written) but only Your Honours Noble acceptance of so meane a present, from the hand of him that heartily wisheth Your Honour all felicity, both corporall and spirituall, temporall and perpetuall; and in that wish, I rest,
(My Lord) Your Honours most faithfull servant,
