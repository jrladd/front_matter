Honoured Friend;
THO the mutual In∣tercourse of kind and good Offices, which hath some Years past betwixt us, and especially at Tunbridg-Wells, might excuse, yea oblige me to so open an Acknowledg∣ment of the Sense I have of
 your Civilities and Friendship, and the inscribing your Name upon these Papers without fur∣ther prospect of you, than in your single and personal Capa∣city, would be too small a re∣turn for those Kindnesses, by which I am become your Deb∣tor.
Yet give me leave to tell you, I herein consider you under that more publick Character, where∣with your Zeal, your Cost, your Pains about the erecting of that commodious, beautiful and Ele∣gant Structure of the Chappel, we all here injoy the benefit of, justly invests you.
And if I could represent your Effigies in the Front of these few
 Sheets, it should be with your green Book in your Hand; gratefully receiving, modestly solliciting, and faithfully recor∣ding, the royal, noble, generous Contributions to this pious use∣ful Work, which have amoun∣ted to about Eleven hundred Pounds, by your prudent Care and Industry, faithfully expen∣ded in the erecting and adoin∣ing of it.
And I hereby, as much as in me lies, constitute you, who was for the greater part, receiver of their Money; Receiver-general in their Name, of all the Ho∣nour I can do them, and the best Gratitude I can return them, for their so large and pious Li∣berality.

And in this Inscription which I make to you, as their Trustee and Representative, I dedicate these Papers to them all, with deepest Submission, begging both their Pardon and Accep∣tance of so faint and dispropor∣tionable a return from the mean∣est of those Divines who wil∣lingly bestow our Pains amongst them, till some of those excel∣lent Persons, of greater Ability, Name and Merit, be pleas'd to do it, with actual Performances, which may equal my Wishes and Desires to do them Honour, and edify and inflame their Devo∣tion.
The late fresh Accession of Princely Bounty, set as a Crown
 upon the Head of the preceding Charity, will not only be the lasting Ornament and Glory of the publick Table, you have exposed in the Chappel to eve∣ry Mans view, of all Monies re∣ceived and expended, (to pre∣vent Obloquy and Suspicion in them who know you not, for those who know you, do not need it;) But I hope is a good Omen, that in due time, it may be as conveniently endow'd as it is commodiously built, that there may be Wells of Salvation for the poor Neighbourhood all the Year; and if I may without imputation of Lightness, allude to St. Paul's Expression, The Word may be preach'd in season, and out of (Water) season. Let not this unexpected Address, be as un∣welcome
 as unlook'd for; nei∣ther let the Meanness of it cool the Reciprocation of that Esteem and Friendship, which hath hi∣therto been so obligingly al∣low'd to, Honoured Sir,

From my Lodgings near Tunbridg-Wells, July 24. 1684.
