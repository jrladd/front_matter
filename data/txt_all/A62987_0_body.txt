MADAM,
THE Reformation of
Poetry, and Restoring
the Muses to the Service of
the Temple, is a Glorious
Work, and requires a Patro∣ness,
whose transcendent
Quality and Virtues can give

Sanction to what she is plea∣sed
to favour.
'Twas therefore my Du∣ty
as well as Ambition, to
present these pious Compo∣sures
to your Royal High∣ness's
Protection; which,
like an Altar, should only
be approach'd with Religi∣ous
Offerings.
A Book design'd for Pub∣lick
Benefit, cannot want
Encouragement from a Prin∣cess
who declines no Op∣portunity
of doing Good.

Piety, Madam, has ap∣pear'd
in all your Actions
and Deportment, with such
prevailing Charms, as have
engaged many to become
her Votaries, even in so de∣prav'd
an Age as This.
Your Royal Brest is the
Sacred Court where the
Graces and Virtues have
their respective Stations, and
where Charity has her
Throne—But Madam,
'twould be Presumption for
any Pen to attempt your

Panegyrick, as it is written
in the Souls and Sentiments
of All who are Admirers of
exemplary and accomplish'd
Worth.
Although 'tis the Tran∣sport
of pious Minds to Con∣template
that exalted State
of Glory, Reserv'd for you
in the Regions of Eternal
Happiness: Yet, Madam,
in Pitty to an Age where
your Pattern and Presence
are so Necessary, Your long
and prosperous Continuance
Here, is the National Wish,

from the Great to the Mean∣est,
and amongst them, the
Prayer of,
Madam,
