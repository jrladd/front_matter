MY dearly beloved Daughters (of which number, I account my two sons wives, my daughters in law, the Countesse of Marlborough, and Mrs. Francis Ashbournham, to be mine also) assu∣ring my selfe of your loves and kinde acceptance, I present this little Booke unto you all, which being mine, I hope you will carefully receive it, as comming from my love and affection towards you, and that you will please for my sake, the more to im∣ploy it to your good; to which I will (while I live) dai∣ly adde my prayers and blessing for your present and future happinesse: and that this my poore labour may prove a happy furtherance to all your good endeavours towards vertue and piety: Therefore let me as a Mo∣ther
 intreat and prevaile with you to esteem so well of it, as often to peruse, ponder, practice, and make use of this Booke according to my intention, though of it selfe unworthy; for you shall finde your greatest hap∣pinesse will be in the true feare, constant love, and faith∣full service of Almighty God, which never faileth of comfort and reward, he being the only and most liberall giver of all good gifts and blessings, both spirituall and temporall; to whose infinite mercy and gracious gui∣dance, I most humbly commend you all, and daily will doe the like in my prayers so long as I live. And fur∣ther, most deare hearts, consider, That these Petitions are presented to a most bountifull and Al-sufficient Lord, that vouchsafeth in Christ to make us his adop∣ted children, and to be our Gracious Father, who gave his only Son for us, in whom he will deny us nothing: And greater benefits then here are asked, cannot bee received; therefore give me leave, since I have such great interest in you, to perswade and obtaine of you all, often to beg these blessings of God, by these prayers faithfully offered up unto his Majesty: Whereby you shall glorifie his holy Name, make your selves eternal∣ly blessed, and bring much joy and comfort to
