SIr, this small, but holy trea∣tise, being gi∣uen mee by him, vnto whom it was written, to send it forth more publikely into the world. And knowing what euill and iniurious enter∣tainement Orphans often∣times receiue in the world, except they haue some spe∣cial friend to countenance them, I am bold to adresse
 my selfe vnto you with this Religious child of a godly learned (but deceased) father for shelter: and indeed vnto whom could I with more assured hope dedicate it for harbour, then to your selfe, vnder whose roofe I and mine are harbored? and therefore that so in som part I might manifest my loue and gratefulnes vnto you, I present this with my selfe alwaies ready to doe you a∣ny good seruice,
