Right Reuerend, and my very good Lord,
I Am bold to entitle these First-fruits unto your Lordships Favor and Protecti∣on, as being conscious how much they need it, to shield them from this Censorious Age: wherein impotent Men (who ought to learn and become Disciples, and reap the Fruits of others Labors) usurp the Chair, and sit as Judges, most severely to censure and condemn. A Generation furnish'd only with Principles destructive; to pull down and not to edifie; to except against what is Written, and superci∣liously smile at the Authors folly (as they have concluded) whil'st they are wise in their own Conceits, and secure themselves from public Censure, by doing nothing that would become a public Spirit: thro detestable Ignorance or

Idleness, betraying the Truth unto their Indu∣strious Adversaries, yielding up a Righteous Cause to the Lusts of Men, for want of Zeal or Courage to defend it.
Now we must needs acknowledg your Lord∣ships great Example and Encouragement hath not bin wanting to the contrary. Your Clergy of this Diocess might have learn'd from you to Preach and Speak boldly in the Defence of Truth, to reason with, and convince Gain-sayers. And for mine own particular, having had the favour somtimes to stand before you, and hear your familiar Communications, in great humility and condescention with such as were far inferior and subject to you, I declare, That from your Lordships occasional Intimati∣on and Discourse, I took the Cue and Invitation to write in the Defence of the Church of Eng∣land, against her Adversaries of Rome: & having reason to distrust my self in so great an Under∣taking, I was confident to commit these poor En∣deavors unto your Censure; and lo! thro your Tenderness and Indulgence, they are improv'd

into a favorable acceptance and Approbation. Whereupon I am encouraged to present them unto public view, and humbly beg, They may pass into the World under the Wing of your Autority and Veneration; and then, no doubt, the malevolent will be sober.
That Almighty God would lengthen your date of Life to rule his Church, and do much good in an evil Generation; and finally Crown your Piety with Immortality and Glory, is the Praier of,
