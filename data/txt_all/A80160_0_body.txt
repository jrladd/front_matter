Much Honoured Sir,
AS the Influence which that eminent place in this City, to which God hath called you, and the Engagements which your goodnesse hath laid upon those few Ministers in it, who have la∣boured against great opposition, to pro∣mote an Ecclesiastick Reformation, have justly challenged our observance to you; so your eminent appearing, not only for it, but in it, accepting the Office of a Ru∣ler in one of the Congregations of it, and your appearing for the restoring of that eminent servant of Christ to his Pastorall charge there again, where these unhappy flames of our division have kindled (wch by the piety and prudence of that Reve∣rend
man would have been prevented) hath challenged for you the more spe∣ciall Dedication of this Tract. What you shall find in it, the Preface will tell you; And the Preface is that alone, which needs your Patronage, nor should that stand in need of it, if some men had not the confidence to deny that the Sunne shines at noon-day, whether what is there related be truth or no, your selfe can in a great measure satisfie the En∣quirer. For the substance of the Booke, when you have examined it, I shall be content you should dismisse it your pro∣tection, and shall my selfe attend the vindication of it from its adversaries, who are ordinarily more clamorous then argumentative. If my paines may contribute any thing Sir to encourage your perseverance in that good worke to which the Lord hath quickned you to put your hand, as it will be a great matter of encouragement and joy to all of us who are working for the Lord in
the refining of Sion (while we are almost stifled with the drosse which the cor∣ruption of former times hath begot) so it will be a great addition to your crown in the day of the Lord, and a great crown to him who is,
Chapyfield house, April. 19. 1654.
SIR;
