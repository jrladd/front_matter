TO the end, most glorious Queen,
to represent vnto you the trueth
of that which was foretould you
by the L. Knight Cauriana, in his
eloquent and gallant discourse
vnto you presented, at your pros∣perous
departure out of Tuscane
to come into this realme, where
through Gods grace you are now resident: namely,
to your glory, your fame, and your rare vertues, should
heereafter minister argument and matter to writers: al∣beit
my selfe be none of the number of those whose
Pen may be worthy, yet hath a naturall instinct, that
should vrge vs to honour you, made mee the first that
should breake this Yce. Howbeit to auoyde the title of
presumption, in taking more vpon me then I am able to
performe, I haue thought good onely to translate into
this language the selfe same discourse of Cauriana, to
the end that by this meanes you may the better like of
my zeale, which may minister vnto you an entrance to
learne (if alreadye you knowe it not) the language of
your affectionate Frenchmen: besides that, otherwise
I am not able more worthily to celebrate your great
vertues and commendations. The Lorde vouchsafe
long to preserue you, to the good and quiet of this
estate.
