May it please your Excellency,
DID I not very well know your great
Understanding in, and Love to the
Subject of the ensuing Discourse, I durst

not assume the Boldness to implore your
Honours Patronage of it; But being well
assured, that you have not been onely a
Spectator, but an Actor in most of what
is treated of in the ensuing Lines; for,
to your Eternal Prayse be it spoken, there
is many a fine Tree which you have
Nursed up from Seeds sown by your
own hands, and many thousands more
which you have commanded me to
raise.
Therefore, my Lord, I humbly crave
your Pardon for the Presumption and
Imperfection of the Pen-man; and though
your Excellency knows full well how to
prune young Trees, yet I hope you will
pass by the impertinent and superfluous
Lines in this my Plantation; which,
though I have endeavoured to keep as
well pruned from Errors, and as clean
from Weeds as I could, yet 'tis possible
there may be some things in it, which

some may term as ill: But to You all
things in it are so well known, that I
hope both it and I shall find such shelter
and support by your favourable Aspect,
as that we need not to fear the Storms of
the ignorant or negligent Planters.
And my Lord, since the Art of Raising
and Improving of Trees, hath ever been
esteemed amongst the truly Noble, Wise,
Ingenious and most refined Spirits of the
World from Age to Age, and chiefly
maintained and practised by them; and
since this Property is Naturally inherent
in You, (you being not onely a great
Lover of this Art, but also most skilfull
in it) I humbly presume to Dedicate these
my Observations to your Lordship; not
being ignorant, that he who is most know∣ing
in any thing, is the best able to judge
of the same; and that this my Opinion,
of your Honours Ability and Prompti∣tude
in promoting the Planting and Im∣proving

of Forrest-trees, is surely ground∣ed,
the Large Plantation you have made
will abundantly testifie. But I humbly
beg your Lordships Pardon for this Pre∣sumption,
not without hopes that my
good Meaning may obtain it; and since
my good Wishes and the best of my Ser∣vices
is all I can contribute to You, these
shall never be wanting from
My LORD,
Your Excellencies most Humble
and most Obedient Servant to serve You
whilest I bear the Name of
