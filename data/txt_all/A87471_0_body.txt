SIR,
TO speak of Kings, was heretofore a task of as much difficulty as dan∣ger: but to receive what Kings have written, or what Kings have spoke, espe∣cially when their words have aimed at a publick end, as the advancement of the peoples happinesse, or the suppressing of enormities, is a work not
 onely safe but honourable; their precepts oftentimes being as powerfull as their examples: for the words of illustrious personages, do carry with them a secret attraction, and leave a deeper impression when the greatnesse of their persons is attended with the greatnesse of their Virtues. Indeed to speak or write well is the common happinesse of great men, who in the height of an extraordinary fortune, for the most part do expresse the height of an extraordinary un∣derstanding. The letters of Phalaris are at this day extant, and report him louder for his Valour, Knowledge, and Mag∣nificence,
 than Perillus Bull could for his cruelty.
But I shall here present you with a nearer, & a more grace∣ful prospect; The selected say∣ings of a King, who in the me∣mory of many yet living reign∣ed over this nation. A Platonick King, if we may trust the ap∣probation of the age but im∣mediately before us. A King who by his own books provi∣ded better for the title of a happy memory, than many of his Predecessors who left it to the flattery of the times, & the vanity and complement of cu∣stome. I shall here give you a sight of what sayings at several times did fall but carelesly and
 without premeditation from him, which being as short as they are acute, and acute as they are grave, I hope may not unfitly be termed Apho∣risms: to speak more were to anticipate your understanding. I leave therefore the book to your acceptance, whose accu∣rate judgement, can examine and advance an Apothegm, and whose candor can pardon an errour▪ if perchance in this re∣collection any errour be slipt into it by the sudden unadvi∣sednesse of him who is.
Sir,
