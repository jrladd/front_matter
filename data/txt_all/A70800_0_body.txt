SIR,
THo' I have long
been Ambitious of
giving some pub∣lick
Instance of the Vene∣ration

I have for You, I
would not have presum'd
to have done it now, had
not the Book, of which
what follows is a Transla∣tion,
been written by an
Embassador, and dedica∣ted
to a King. The
Character which you have
so honourably maintain'd,
not only at the Court of
that Prince, but with an
Emperor greater than that
of Morocco, entitles You
to the Protection of more
finish'd Works than this;

the Author of which, tho'
a Person of great Skill in
Business, perhaps not un∣justly,
thinks himself not
altogether vers'd in the
nice way of Writing:
Yet his Book contains so
many pleasant and useful
Remarks, and may disco∣ver
so many Mysteries to
the piercing Eyes of a
sound Politician, that You
are Master of too much
Goodness not to allow it
a Place, on that Score, a∣mong
that admirable Col∣lection

which You possess
no less in Your Mind than
in Your Library. Fear,
not, SIR, I should, like
many Dedicators, attempt
a Panegyrick instead of an
Epistle; I know You are
so far from being the least
indulgent to such a Pra∣ctice,
that You more care∣fully
avoid Addresses of
this Nature, than some,
who deserve them less,
industriously encourage
them. For still Your
Modesty seeks as much to

keep Your other Vertues
veil'd, as most of us Wri∣ters
do to discover them;
and it has brib'd some of
them into a Concealment
of Your real Merit, in a
more liberal Manner than
the Vanity of many has
recompens'd a Publicati∣on
of their imaginary
Worth. I dare not then
pretend to mention those
Qualifications that endear
You to Your Country;
nor am I so partial to my
self as to desire You to

protect the Original or the
Translation of this Book
from the Censures of the
Reader, to whom I freely
abandon it.
My whole Design is
merely the Acknowledg∣ment
of Favors receiv'd;
tho' at the same time You
cannot pardon this with∣out
conferring a new one;
since I know You would
have bestow'd on me fresh
Marks of Your Genero∣sity,
had I consented to
spare You the Blush which

the sight of this will raise.
But, SIR, even those
who are not able to return
Obligations, if of a grate∣ful
Principle, do not love
to be too much indebted;
and 'tis some Ease at least
to Acknowledge when
we cannot Requite. I
only beg then, to let all
those who will read this
know, That I have the
deepest Sense imaginable
of Your obliging Good∣ness,
that singular Huma∣nity,
or rather Charity,

which, as it extends to ma∣ny
of our unhappy Refu∣giés,
has made me a sharer
in the Effects of Your
Bounty, doubtless much
more than the most tole∣rable
of my Attempts as a
Writer. You pitied a
Man, who, having the
real Love of a Loyal
English Subject for the
Great Prince under whom
we live, endeavours to ap∣pear
as much an En∣glishman
as he can, even in
his Writings, since he is

driven on the barren Coast
of Parnassus, that idle Bu∣siness
Poetry, for want
of better. May Heaven
still preserve You for the
Good of Mankind, and
more particularly of Your
Country, to whom You
so wholly devote Your
Self; and may You be∣lieve
me with the greatest
Zeal and Respect,
SIR,
Your most humble, and
Most obedient Servant,
