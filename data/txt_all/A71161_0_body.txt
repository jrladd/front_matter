My Lord,
IT cannot be improper, certainly, for one of your Clergy to make an Address of this Nature to your Lordship, and upon a Religious Theme too. If the Office be any one's 'tis yours, upon Approbation to vindicate (as it lies in your way) the honest Essays and Exercises of those which are under your Disci∣pline. Permit it to go into the world under your Lordship's Name, and leave all the Defects and Imperfecti∣ons upon the Author's Score: 'Tis enough to me, if the Substance of
it be pretty tolerable. We are no Angels, but a kind of degenerate Spirits dress'd up in Flesh and Blood, and acting here a while according to those Organs, and Faculties, and Advantages we are supplied with, in the Service of our Great Crea∣tor and Redeemer.
My Lord,
Upon a Survey of all Churches in the World, I think, we of this Church and Nation, are as happy as any People under the Sun; ex∣cept only in one thing, that we nei∣ther Know, nor Value our own Happiness: A Vertigo, and Spirit of Giddiness, hath possessed the Na∣tion of late years, which makes our Heads turn round upon our Shoul∣ders, and our Hearts unquiet and discontented within us. We have Excellent (both) Doctrine and Wor∣ship, and as good a Class of Bishops
and Clergy; and as much Learning, Piety and Prosperity as any Church within Ken. Notwithstanding, would to God a Pencil were drawn once more over those Lines which administer any Occasion of Obje∣ction; that if possible, our Light may shine clearer, and our Beauty be more inviting to all Beholders; and our Lustre so convictive to our Adversaries, that we may have no Occasion of Disputing, but the Comfort and Praise of Believing, and Living and Loving like Chri∣stians.
May your Lordship go on, as you have begun, to preside over this Diocess with a Gravity of Ad∣monition, Exemplariness of Con∣versation, and Integrity of Disci∣pline, till it shall seem good to the Almighty, who placed you here, to remove you hence, either to Hea∣ven,
or a Better Station upon Earth; Which is the hearty Pray∣er of,
My Lord,
