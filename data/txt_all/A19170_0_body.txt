MOST puissant Prince,
whose fame is knowne so well,
And whose renowne
so farre abroad doth shine,
That it is found
all others to excell,
And equall with that of the worthies Nine:
Borne by discent of right Paternall line,
To be the heire, and thonor to obtaine,
To weare the Crowne of mighty Kingdomes twaine.


Who even as farre as Phoebus in the spheare
Celestiall, doth spread his beames most bright;
And as Lucina with her face most cleare,
The world doth compasse round, & cast her light:
Art held to be the most renowned knight,
And worthy for the honor of thy name,
To sit on high in throane of Lady Fame.


And hold the palme of honor in thy hand,
In triumph for thy noble victory,
For which thou feared t by sea and land,
And ever with perpetuall praise and glory,
Shalt for thy conquest fresh in memory,
Sit opposite before her to be seene,
With wreath about thy head of Lawrell greene,



In former time for Conquerors ordain'd,
That constantly persever'd to the end,
And valiantly warre once begun maintain'd,
For causes iust, and did their right defend,
And therevnto their forces did only bend:
Whose fame's still spread, & was long time agone,
Among whom thou by right mayst sit for one.


For through the world it's known to every one,
(And flying Fame reports it farre and wide,)
That thou by naturall condition,
In things begun wilt constantly abide,
And for the time dost wholly set aside
All rest, and never carst what thou dost spend,
Till thou hast brought thy purpose to an end.


And that thou art most circumspect and wise,
And dost effect all things with providence,
(As Iosua did) by counsell and advise,
Against whose sword ther's none can make defēce,
And wisedome hast by heavenly influence,
With Salomon, to iudge and to discerne
Mens causes, and thy people to governe.


For mercy mixt with thy magnificence,
Doth make thee pitty all that are opprest,
And to withstand the force and violence
Of those that right and equity detest;
With Dauid thou to piety art prest;
And like to Iulius Caesar valorous,
That in his time was most victorious.


And in one hand (like worthy Prince) dost hold
Thy sword, to see that of thy subiects none
Against thee should presume, with courage bold
And pride of heart to raise rebellion,
Thereby to shake off thy subiection:
And in the other Scepter, to maintaine
True iustice, while amōgst vs thou dost raigne.



Then sith thou art adorn'd with Maiestie,
Grace, wisedome, pitie, and benignitie;
With humble heart I craue submissiuelie
That thou wilt not disdaine, but pleased be
T'accept this Booke, though rudely done by me:
Thereby thy great and Princely mind t'expresse,
By taking pitie of my simplenesse,


And in thy high and magnanimious hart,
With naturall jngrafted Sapience;
Remember Christ accepted in good part
The wido wes almes of two poore single pence,
When she (without expecting recompence)
Gaue to the poore with willing heart and glad,
That little gift being all that ere she had.


Let this, if that it may thee not offend,
Example be vnto thy Noblenesse,
And of thy great benignitie, extend
Thy favor vnto me with gentlenesse,
Not to disdaine me for my barrennesse
Of wit, and though I haue no skill in muse,
Let my good will and meaning me excuse.


More then good heart, none can whatsoere he bee
Present, or giue to God, nor vnto man.
Which for my part I wholy giue to thee,
And ever shall as farre foorth as I can,
Wherewith I will (as I at first began)
Continually, not ceasing night and day,
With sincere mind for thine estate thus pray.


First that thou maist Gods mercy so procure
Vnto thy selfe, that he may still advance
Thine honor, and that thou maist here endure
Thy raigne ore vs with long continuance,
And all thy Subiects true obeysance:
And that he will vouchsafe to giue to thee
All vertues whatsoere may reckned bee.





GO forth my Booke vaild with the Princely Grace
Of him, that is extold for excellence
Throughout the world, but do not shew thy face,
Without support of his magnificence:
And whosoere against thee takes offence,
Be thou not stubborne with presumption;
But see thou arme thy selfe with patience,
And gently yeeld to their correction.
