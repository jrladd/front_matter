My truest Friend:
THE most vnualuable and dismaifull hope of my most deare and Heroicall Pa∣trone, Prince HENRY, hath so stricken all my spirits to the earth, that I will ne∣uer more dare, to looke vp to any great∣nesse; but resoluing the little rest of my poore life to obscuritie, and the shadow of his death; prepare euer hereafter, for the light of heauen.
So absolute, constant, and noble, your loue hath beene to mee; that if I should not as effectually, by all my best expres∣sions, acknowledge it; I could neither satisfie mine owne affe∣ction, nor deserue yours.
Accept therefore, as freely as I acknowledge, this vnpro∣fitable signe of my loue; till God blessing my future labours, I may adde a full end, to whatsoeuer is begunne in your assu∣rance of my requitall. A little, blest, makes a great feast (my best friend) and therefore despaire not, but that, out of that little, our loues alwayes made euen, may make you say, you
  rather beene happy in your kindnesse, then in the least degree, hurt. There may fauours passe betwixt poore friends, which euen the richest, and greatest may enuy. And GOD that yet neuer let me liue, I know will neuer let me die an empaire to any friend. If any good, more then requitall suc∣ceede, it is all yours as freely, as euer yours was mine; in which noble freedome and alacritie of doing; you haue thrice done, all I acknowledge. And thus knowing, I giue you little contentment, in this so farre vnexpected publication of my gratitude; I rest satisfied with the ingenuous discharge of mine owne office. Your extraordinary and noble loue and sorrow, borne to our most sweet PRINCE, entitles you wor∣thily to this Dedication: which (with my generall Loue, vn∣fainedly protested to your whole Name and Family) I con∣clude you as desertfull of, at my hands, as our Noblest Earle; and so euer remaine
