Right Worshipfull,
IT was the custome of the Persian Kings, when they saw their chil∣dren misdemeane themselues, at the first to spare them, and to pu∣nish their seruants in their sight, to trie if that would terrifie them from their sinister courses: Thus hath the King of Kings of late dealt with vs, who as we hope are his children; for noting our misbehauiour, he hath spared vs, and with immoderate showers and ouer-swelling waters he hath punished the earth that was created to be seruiceable to vs. Many can familiarly discourse of this, but few make any good vse thereof: which I haue seene and obserued with sorrow. And knowing it a dutie incident to my calling, to put men

in minde of Gods secret admonishments, I applied my me∣ditations to that purpose, which I also deliuered in your Worships presence, and haue now (according to your re∣quest) sent you a true copie of the same. The manifold vn∣deserued kindnesses which I haue receiued from you, doe binde me to make an vnfained acknowledgement of my loue and dutie to you, which I shall be ready vpon euery occasion to manifest, and my praiers shall alwaies attend you and your Familie.
From Spoforth the 21. of October.
