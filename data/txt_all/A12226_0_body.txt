IT was my fortune (right wor∣shipfull) not many daies since, to light vpon the famous de∣uice of Astrophel and Stella, which carrying the generall commendation of all men of iudgement, and being reported to be one of the rarest things that euer any Englishman set abroach, I haue thought good to publish it vnder your name, both for I know the excellencie of your wor∣ships conceipt, aboue all other to be such, as is onely fit to discerne of all matters of wit, as also for the credite and countenaunce your patronage may giue to such a worke. Accept of it I beseech you, as the first fruites of my affection, which desires to approoue it selfe in all dutie vnto you: and though the Argu∣ment perhaps may seeme too light for your

graue viewe, yet considering the worthines of the Author, I hope you will entertaine it accordingly. For my part, I haue beene very carefull in the Printing of it, and where as be∣ing spred abroade in written Coppies, it had gathered much corruption by ill Writers: I haue vsed their helpe and aduice in correc∣ting & restoring it to his first dignitie, that I knowe were of skill and experience in those matters. And the rather was I moued to sette it forth, because I thought it pittie anie thing proceeding from so rare a man, shoulde bee obscured, or that his fame should not still be nourisht in his works, whom the works with one vnited griefe bewailed. Thus crauing pardon for my bold attempt, & desiring the continuance of your worshippes fauour vnto mee, I ende.
