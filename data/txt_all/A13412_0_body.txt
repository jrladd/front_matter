Worthy Sir,
WHEN all the excellent admi∣red wits of this so capable Age, in the spring of thicke furnitur'd inuentions, bestow paines to giue my Patrons a per∣fect blazon, I willing to thrust my dutifull loue into the Presse, longing to see the shape of affe∣ction in Print; Credo vt est dementia, Seeing so many swelling Muses, and of such apprehension, that read theirs and mine next together, and you will say, my ill worke makes their good labours to appeare better then (indeed) they are. Vt sementem feceris, ita & metes: Apply not that Rule to mee, but right worthy Sir, of what I offer willingly, vouch to accept courteously, as a Monument of my loue, which
 time hath borne to the generous family of the Gerrards, and my affection to your worthy selfe. Knowing you to come from the best worth of that Aierie, and one of his Maiesties respected, grace my ill-tempered Muse: and hauing so worthy a refuge, you shall hereafter see it start out of Cinders (vnus dies non sat estad parandam eru∣ditionem) and liue an age that ere-while waxt old with a Sommers day. Vouch to allow of this, till time present you with some greater token of my loue: I commit your deseruing worthinesse to wished continuance.

Volenti nihil est graue.
