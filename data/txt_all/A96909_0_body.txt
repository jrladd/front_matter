My very good Lord,
Te many favours, which I received from your Noble Family, especially, from your Lordship, rought, upon a disposition, some-deale a pretender unto gratitude, how it might in some measure, or other, answer the respect, and cleare the heart, that had layen charg'd so long, wth benefits; but it found no meanes but (onely thus) to let your Honour see, that the favours which were conferr'd upon me: were not spilt, but powred into a Violl, that (what it hath received and containes, bears Paper of acknowledgment, and
 that, neither the distances of Time, nor Place, nor all the (Left-handed) stroaks of fortune, which have lately fallen so heavily, upon your Illustrious Family, shall ever be able, to beat down a respect, that emulates the Cypresse which bears up (still) in growth maugre the heavy weights, which the hand of fate (ignorant of its virtue) hath so hung, on all her branches. My Lord, it may be it will not be unpleasing to your Lordship, to read your Father, speaking after death; especially, when you read him, dying, with such speeches in his mouth. I layd your Noble Father in his grave, with my own hands, but I could not let such a memoriall of him, lye buried, under my own Manuscript; but thought it a du∣ty belonging to his fame, and your merit, to de∣dicate this book unto your Lordship, Heir to all: but apparently to nothing, but his virtues, and this memoriall of them; which in all humility, (together with my self) I prostrate at your feet; who think it the greatest honour, still to be owned,
