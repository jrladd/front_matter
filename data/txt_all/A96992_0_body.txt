O Pierce my heart with fervent love of thee!God.
The beauty of thy face, Lord, let me see!
Rise from thy cloudy Eastern cloysters black,
Spread forth thy glorious beames and be not slack,
To thawe my Icie heart, which sinne hath frosen,
Assure my conscience, Lord, I am thy chosen.
And thou my Sovereigne,The King. Charles, all Europs splendor,
Thine enemies terrour and true Faith's Defendr,
Thy love preserv'd my life, not heathenish fate,
In thy Majestick face, true Princely state:
When malice plotted mischief everie houre,
Thy clemency prevented all their power:
That God which grac'd thee with a Royall Crowne,
Crown thee with grace, thy Honours with renown.
* All you poore soules whose eares have been abused,People.
With scandalous reports and eyes traduced
With charmes of turbulent spirits; new take and view,
This Declaration honest, plain, and true.
