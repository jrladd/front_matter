My Lord,
TO make a Dedication of this small peice to your Honour, would be a Crime, if there were not such reasons as might not only excuse, but even com∣mand the same from me. The very least is Gratitude, which obliges me to ac∣knowledg your singular kindness and favour, being setled once in a Family hav∣ing a branch sprung out of your Noble Stock; and much the same overtures having
 been since made towards such another imployment; But tho these considerations are too great to be passed by in silence, yet there is an higher reason which enfor∣ces me to this undertaking; 'tis your Lordships Piety, that sincere, solid and ex∣emplary Piety, which is to be seen in you. 'Tis your owning and maintaining Religion in your Principles and Practice, publickly and privately approving your self to be a Disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ; having learnt that lesson of the A∣postle, to be stedfast, unmova∣ble,
 always abounding in the Work of the Lord, as knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. Pardon me, my Lord, that I prefix your name, it being so suitable, it being that of a sound Believer, a sincere Christian, and with∣al so high and Noble; one who not only believes what Atheists deny, and expects what they deny, but adorns the Profession he makes of the blessed Gospel, and so confounds them: That your Honour is not ashamed of the Gospel, is most evident, and I am bold to think that your Lordship will not be
 offended with what is here offered to you, because 'tis Written for a defence of the same: The Lord God Al∣mighty, before whom you walk, reward you, may his blessings be upon your head, and may your Posterity share in your Piety, and par∣take of the same Mercies of the ever blessed God, both in this World, and for ever, so Prays (my Lord)
