RIght Wor∣shipful, for∣asmuch as the historie of Guicchi∣ardine hath wonne sufficient credite in mens opinions to coūtenance it selfe against the enuious: I hope my boldnes may much the better bee excused, presu∣ming to publish in print this treatise containing all the no∣table and materiall things in that Hystorie: whosoeuer hee
 was that hath bestowed his trauaile to reduce so great a volume into so small and ne∣cessarie a Booke (though his name be suppressed) hee may merit, no doubt, his due com∣mendation: I thought it a ne∣cessarie office for me to make shew of my good disposition, in due consideration towards you whom I haue knowne of along time to be exercised in forraine affaires, and imploied in matters of some weight for her Maiesties seruice and the estate: Hauing thereon ad∣dicted my selfe to thinke you meete to receyue this little
 Booke into your protection, which most affectionatly I re∣commend vnto you, with my prayers vnto the eternall God for your worships health and long life.
From my house in the new rents in Saint Nicho∣las shambles, this seuenth of December. 1591.
