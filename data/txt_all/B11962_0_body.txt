HAuing for some reasons be∣gun, and by Gods goodnesse finished this little booke, be∣ing after the vsuall manner, to make choise of some per∣son or persons, vnder whose name I might commend it to the world, my affection ca∣ried me as the first, so at the last, to re∣solue generally vpon those who are my kinsmen in the flesh, both by consanguini∣tie or affinitie, who although by the proui∣dence of God they be separated and seated as it were in the East and the West, yet I desire and indeauour, that they may sit to∣gether with Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, in the kingdome of God: and particulerly I made choise of you, as the chiefe among the rest, especially that I am knowne vnto and may be bolde withall, to whome for auncient loue and benefits I haue beene most beholding, especially because this
 little booke, as a messenger of my thanke∣fulnesse, might stand in steed of other du∣ties, which the distance of place, and other necessities, will not suffer me to performe vnto you and yours, praying you with all the rest of my friends, as if I named them, to accept and read it with the same affecti∣on that I haue written it, which I shall take as a recompence of my trauaile, in hope of the fruite thereof that may vnite vs more neerely by a new birth, in the spirituall kin∣dred of Christianitie, which I beseech Al∣mighty God in Iesus Christ our Lord, by his omnipotent and holy spirit, to bring to passe in vs all for our mutuall reioysing in this life, and eternall saluation in the life to come, Amen.
