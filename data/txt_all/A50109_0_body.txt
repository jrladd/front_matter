THe Gentile Superstition, (Madam) in∣scrib'd not the Names or their Deities upon the greatest Donaries which they made
them, with a Devotion comparable to that, with which I lay this Little Thing at Your Grace's Feet.
The Compilement of this Structure is not in a Lofty and Noble Corin∣thian form, with any Rich or Curious Embrodery of Words; but the whole is cemented together in the plain Tuscan. I could have given it a Franker Light, had I not known that Devotion (for which
this Spirituall House was built) requires collected, rather then diffused Spi∣rits.
I dare not assume the Vanity, to think that it is (as the Italians use to speak of a well built Stru∣cture) Fabrica ben raccolta. But if Your Grace (who are so excellent a Judge) be pleas'd to afford it Your Approbation, for its use∣fulness or seasonableness, I shall rejoyce in my Endea∣vour: If otherwise, the
hand that erected, shall be first upon it, to pull it in pieces, and condemn it to rubbage and ruine.
But since (Madam) the simple Dedication of an Altar, (though the Mate∣rials of it are but Turf or Brick, and the Hand that erected it, unacquainted with Art) hath ever se∣cur'd it against all, but Sa∣crilegious Hands; I am ready to overcome my Reason into a Belief, that this (otherwise inconside∣rable)
Piece, pleading the Cause of His most Sacred Majestie's Nomotheticall and Coercive Power in Matters of Religion, the Prelacy of my Lords, the Reverend Bishops (as Governours sent by him) and of the Pious (though despised) Liturgy of our Church (which three are fairly seated, and ruling in Your Graces Soul) it shall live under the shadow of Your great Name.
Thus (Madam) not
without deep acknow∣ledgement of Your Gra∣ces undeserved Favours to my most unworthy Self, I take the boldness to assure you, that the re∣maining Thoughts and Actions of my Life, shall zealously aim at the Ho∣nour of being,
My most honoured Lady,  Decemb. the 20th. 1660.
