SINCE we may Daily observe, That the Romish Foxes, both Jesu∣its, Priests, and Layity, do lay out the utmost of their strength and Policy, to introduce their cursed Principles and Practices into this King∣dom, it concerns every Man to be upon his Guard, and to endeavour as much as possible to secure and forewarn all Pro∣testants of the danger of the return of that medly of Non-sence, Blasphemy, and Slavery; And young Persons espe∣cially
 ought to be truly informed thereof, since the design of these Sons of Belial, is to debauch the Youth of this Nation; and therefore upon all occasions you shall hear them vilifying all Religion, and a∣busing the Holy Scriptures; there being none fitter to be Roman Catholicks (as they non-sensically call themselves) than Atheists; because they find little or no difference between the Popish Religion, (if it deserves that Name) and none at all, since Treasons, Rebellions, Murders, Rapes, Burnings, and all manner of the most Horrid Cruelties Hell it self can in∣vent, are so far from being Crimes or Sins, that they are many times counted meritorious, and a Man shall deserve Heaven for committing them, according to the Doctrine of that Church; there being no sin unpardonable, but that which they falsly call Heresie, or the true Wor∣ship of God according to the Scriptures; and for this it is that they would have murdered our Gracious Sovereign, turn∣ed our Land into Blood, Slaughter, and
 Confusion: For this they would have overthrown our Religion, enslaved our Consciences, or else have burnt our Bo∣dies to Ashes, as they did our Ancestors; It is difficult to give a draught of this bloody Beast of Rome, it would be a horrid sight to draw him in his full pro∣portion, yet take a short view of him, so as to tremble at the thoughts of what others have suffered, and what he yet hopes to inflict upon us, if Divine Pro∣vidence prevent him not; though no doubt but the Almighty will save and deliver us out of his Hands: His Eyes are Flames that have consumed the Bodies of many Thousand Martyrs, His Mouth is like Hell gaping for his Prey; Blood gushes out of his Jaws like Ri∣vers, his bloody Tuskes are the Racks and tormenting Engines wherewith he grinds the Bones of Gods Saints, His Tail is Armed with the stings of Scorpions, where∣with he lashes Kings and Kingdoms; from his Throat he belches forth Curses and Excommunications, and denounces
 Judgments and Death upon all that op∣pose him, It is this Monster of Perse∣cution and Cruelty that the Slaves of Rome endeavour to advance in all places where they have Power and Authority, and by this you may Judge of their Prin∣ciples and Religion; by these evil Fruits you may Judge of the Tree, and what Spirit they are of; their hopes are ve∣ry great, and their confidence mighty, but we trust Heaven will blast their de∣signs, and overthrow their Machinati∣ons, and yet save his People.
So that we may have cause to bless the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and to praise him in the Congregation; Let us there∣fore have no disagreement among Pro∣testants, but let us as one Man by all justifiable and lawful methods, in our se∣veral Places and Stations, oppose this armed Beast of Persecution; And let us instruct our Youth both in their Princi∣ples and Practices, that so they may a∣void and fly from them, as from that which will certainly ruine Soul, Body,
 and Estate for ever. This is the design of this little Book, which will give a brief Account of the Mischiefs and Villanies committed by that Man of sin upon the Servants of God, ever since he appeared in the World, the like of which were ne∣ver acted by Heathens, Turks, or Infi∣dels; and since they make so ill use of Pi∣ctures upon many accounts; I have en∣deavoured to draw in Picture some short strokes of the variety of their Tortures, practised upon Protestants, a Volume not being able to contain the whole of their Horrid Massacres, and Inhumane tor∣ments.
Here are likewise Rules for teaching young people to read English, so that this may serve instead of any other Book of this kind; and youth may at the same time reap both profit and Delight; and thereby learn in time to read their Bible, that Great Enemy to the Popish Church, and which they formerly have, and would a∣gain burn as well as our Bodies, if it were in their power. Therefore let us Con∣clude
 in the words of the Royal Psalmist, Psalm 5. Destroy thou the wicked and mischievous Persecutors O God, let them fall by their own Councils, Cast them out in the multitude of their Transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee, but let all those who put their Trust in thee rejoyce, let them ever shout for Joy, because thou defendest them, let them also that love thy Name be Joyful in thee; For thou O Lord wilt bless the Righ∣teous, with favour wilt thou com∣pass him as with a Shield. Amen.
