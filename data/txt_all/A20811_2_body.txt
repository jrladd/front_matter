MY singuler good Lady, your many vertues
knowne in generall to all, and your gracious fa∣uours
to my vnwoorthy selfe, haue confirmed
that in mee, which before I knew you, I onelie
sawe by the light of other mens iudgements.
Honour seated in your breast, findes herselfe
adorned as in a rich pallace, making that excellent which makes
her admirable; which like the Sunne (from thence) begetteth
most precious things of this earthly worlde, onely by the vertue
of his rayes, not the nature of the mould. VVorth is best discer∣ned
by the worthie, deiected mindes want that pure fire which
should giue vigor to vertue. I referre to your great thoughts, (the
vnpartiall Iudges of true affection) the vnfained zeale I haue
euer borne to your honorable seruice; and so rest your Ladiships
humbly to commaund.
