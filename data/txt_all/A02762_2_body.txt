IN peace men vse for to prouide for warre,
Best Pylots doe waite for ensuing storm's;
Yea, euen this wisedome is in sillie worm's
(Who though from reasons reach they stray so farre,)
In Summer still for winter to prepare,
So though your Sunne, Sir, now doe shine so cleare,
That storm's appeare not either farre or neare;
Yet since experience hath found it so rare,
To haue two heau'ns and in them both a stare:
Long time without some crossing gloom tonight;
When Wraths heart gnawing fear's shall dim the sight
Of former grace, filling the minde with Care.
Though still I wish your mind free from such fear's:
Let this yet neere (if need be) stanch such teares.
