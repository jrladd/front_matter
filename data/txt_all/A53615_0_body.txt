YOur beauties (La∣dies and Gentle∣women) are but types and shadows of the beauty of your vertuous minde, which is discerned by Noble and Courteous actions. I may therefore presume that

Ovid's Heroical Epistles, chiefly translated for your sakes, shall find a gentle accep∣tance, sutable to your Heroical dispositions, for Courtesie and Ingenuity are the companions of Gentility. But those who claim this Title, and are de∣graded of it by their own viti∣ous qualities, Ovid disclaims them. Vertue is an invisible gift, which is not discerned by the outward habit, but by speech and action, and a certain delectation in vertue, as Mode∣sty, Temperance, and especial∣ly

curtesie; to which Ovid doth appeal. For when Rome knew him famous, he was esteemed of Love and Ladies, so that he was fain to shadow the ambi∣tious love of the Emperours daughter towards him under the vail of Corynna, but the Emperour saw through it, and banished him. Besides, these E∣pistles, in regard of their sub∣ject, have just relation to you, Ladies and Gentlewomen, be∣ing the complaint of Ladies and Gentlewomen for the ab∣sence of their Lovers; And that

their sorrow may be more sen∣sible, there is a Table prefixed, & adjoyning to the book, pre∣senting the several Pictures of the Arguments of the Epi∣stles. So much concerning the work, and the Author Ovid, now you expect a comple∣ment for the Dedication.
Ladies and Gentlewomen, since this book of Ovid's which most Gentlemen could read before in Latin, is for your sakes come forth in English, it doth at first address it self a Suiter, to wooe your acceptance, that it may kiss your hands, and afterward have the lines thereof in reading sweetned by the odour of your breath, while the dead letters form'd into words by your divided lips, may receive new life by your passionate expression, and the words married in that Ruby-coloured Temple, may thus happily united, multiply your content∣ment. And in a word let this be.
