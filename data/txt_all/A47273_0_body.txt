Right Honourable, And Right Worshipful:
FAME proclaiming every-where your deserved worth, it reach'd my ear; and hearing how careful your Ho∣nour and Worships have been in the preservation of every individual person, but such more especially committed to your Tutelage

(wherein you have shewn your selves indulgent Fathers, as well as prudent Governors) I could do no less then step in amongst the crowd of your Honours and Worships admirers, to make my grateful acknowledgement. I have but this Mite to offer; but as much water as the palm of my Hand will hold, to east into this new-kin∣dled fire; and yet it may quench it ere it rise to a flame, if the heavenly Physician see it good. The peaceful Dove hath now got some few fick feathers; let her not therefore be deserted. Some of late have forsaken her, because fallen sick a little; which argues both their ingratitude and folly, in flying that Mother which gave some breath, others benefit and profit, thinking thereby they can shun the hand of Gods just judgement. In this Honourable City I first drew my breath, and received the major part of my education: as your Honours and Worships therefore, are our Fathers in general, so I hope you will not deny me your particular Patronage. Let your noble fa∣vours then strengthen this weak hand, which a Sons duty reacheth forth to a Mothers sup∣port: grateful pity commands me thus to do▪ and my knowledge in reading (with the experi∣ence

of others) justifieth the act. Accept there∣fore of these my well-wishing indeavours; and whilst some are using the means, let others joyn with them in Prayers to Almighty God to be mer∣ciful to this City, and if it be his blessed will to sheath his sword, and unbend his bow, that the dreadful Judgement of the Plague may be averted from us. Pardon, I beseech you, this grand presumption, and I shall glory in subscri∣bing my self
Right Honourable, And Right Worshipful,
