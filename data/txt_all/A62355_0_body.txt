My Lord.
TO repeat your Lord-ships Tytles, and the Merits by which you atchieved them, and your just Administration under them, re∣quires a larger volume then I here pre∣sent you, nor had you received any other demonstration of my duty, till I had pay∣ed it in that kind, could I believe my self fit for so great an enterprize. To contract them into the narrow compass of an Epistle, is a diminution I dare not think of, since no Reader capable of this treatise can be ignorant of more then I could here tell him, should I extend it much beyond the ordinary limits: and Posterity can turn over no leaf in the English History (during our last twenty years transactions) wherein he will not find frequent mention of your Lord-ships name so involved in the principal affaires, that no alteration the Island can suffer (whil'st inhabited by men) can extinguish your memory. A change of language in our Nation by foreign Conquest or confusion like that of Babel, would for a short time obscure it; but retained by all other parts of the knowing world in their me∣morials of our stupendious changes, how soon will the next commerce bring it back again? and consecrate your name to the utmost ex∣tent of time. Amidst these considerations I make humble tender of all I can. The Itinerary of Italy, translated long after my return thence, in those vacant hours which I allowed to diversion, without farther intention then to renew that language by a re∣translation (which occasioned my so close keeping to the Italian

names and Idiome) and once more to travel that celebrate Countrey in this exact description, whither in my earlier years your Lord∣ship addressed me. Taking wing therefore from your Lordships Hand, and persuit from your direction, the Quarry (such as it is) ought to be your Lordships at the retrive; and though perhaps you will not esteem it fit to range in the first course of Books on your Lordships well furnished Table, yet it may deserve a share in the se∣cond, affording a pleasant repast even to those, who require a more substantial meal. To advance that thought a little, and call it Man∣na (such in every mans mouth as he best liked) though proper e∣nough to the Countrey where it abounds in great perfection, and agreeable to this work, where all appetites, all tasts, may be delight∣ed, would perhaps appear arrogance in me, who deliver it not pure from the tree (on which it falls) but as from an Apothecaries shop, where it may have received some taint. Yet those imper∣fections your Lordship will pardon, and for your Lordships sake this Nation, (at least in some measure) because devoted to you up∣on the score of publique gratitude as well as the particular obli∣gation, of
My Lord,
