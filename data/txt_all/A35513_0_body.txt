My Lord,
GReat Actions are the Subjects of
great Wits; and no Age hath
been so unhappy, but they have
great Personages, if not to exceed, yet
to second and protect them. But the
Atchievements of Alexander the Great,
are so great in themselves, that they
are rather the Subjects of our Wonder
then Belief; nor can any man be a just
Judge of them, who is not indued with

the same Spirit of Fortitude, and with∣al,
transported with the same desire of
glory. Fame, indeed, is not so much
the bound, as the delight of Transcen∣dent
Spirits, who with the unwearied
Travels of their Swords, add Kingdoms
unto Kingdoms, and abstract from the
number of the Nations, to add to the
numbers of their Conquests. How ma∣ny
have we read of, who almost since the
Cradle of the World, have exercised
thus the Power of the Sword, and by a
lamentable happiness, have made the E∣pitaphs
of other Nations to become the
best Annals of their Immortality and
Fury?
But Alexander was as merciful as he
was just; and having overcome the Na∣tions
by force, he always after, by a
newer and Nobler Conquest, did both
overcome and oblige them by his Boun∣ty.
By a rare felicity he had Fortune
intirely in his own Power; and at last
he would become the Master as much of
Fame as of Fortune: He was sad to un∣derstand
that his Atchievements had
brought him to the utmost parts of the
World; and he would have no end of
his Victories, because he would have no

end of his Glory: Having exceeded the
Acts of Men, he would exceed even
Fame her self, unless she could finde
breath enough to raise him unto Heaven,
and leave him there inthron'd amongst
his gods.
And yet for all this vain attempt and
confidence, he might have slept cover'd
with the Dust of Oblivion, were he not
beholden to a better Divinity, and to
the Light of History, which have preser∣ved
his Name throughout all Generati∣ons:
The Prophets have done the one,
and this our Author the other; the Pro∣phets
in the Word of God, and our Au∣thor
in this History: A History drawn
from the Records of Antiquity, and fa∣mous
as Ptolomy himself, a man as admi∣rable
in the Arts of Peace as of War,
who being present with Alexander in all
his Wars, was both his Companion and
his Kinsman: A History composed with
such Art, such State and Truth, that
Lipsius, the most Lettered, and most re∣ceived
of the Criticks, hath affirmed, If
there were ever History pure and legi∣timate,
it was this of Curtius.
It was before imperfect in English, and
laboured at least under a thousand Sole∣cisms;

I have only taken the pains to
put it in a new Dress, and to prepare it
for your Honours hands, to which pre∣cisely
it doth devote it self, and with it,
the most Elaborate Observances of him
who is,
My Lord,
