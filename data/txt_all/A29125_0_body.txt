May it please your Excellency,
NOtwithstanding I am conscious, in the sight of God, of my own unsuitablesse for un∣dertaking such a task as this, both for want of learning & education answerable, and the meannesse also of my Reputation: Yet finding this book of M. John Good∣wins, and his whole Church, so long allready extant in print, as since the 30. of May, and no Answer to it; And finding it very dangerous in many points of doctrine, wherein they dissent from many of their acknowledged brethren, and causing a separation, as is notedly known: And having understanding, through the grace of God, of some peculiar notions, that rightly apprehended, give a full result to all the difference in hand, in all these five particulars dissented in; I thought it my duty, in love to the soules of so many brethren, that not only
walk in the fear of God, and profession of Religion, in which they are reall Practitioners, as their judgement leads them; but have been reall Engagers, from the be∣ginning, for the Parliament and Commonwealth of England, as is publiquely known: I am content to be∣come as a fool in some mens eyes, in undertaking so great an encounter in such deep Divinity, that hath troubled the wisest and deepest judgements in all ages, and never as yet brought to a clear result, but is still left doubtfull in all their writings, never obtaining an in∣fallible assent, but many strange dissentings have ever appeared in all ages about these particulars.
However, I for my part, being satisfied, both from sa∣cred Scripture, and clear Rationality in those respects; and hoping in God that he will make me able to clear it up, and make it obvious to any rationall apprehension, against any opposition that can be held forth by these dissenting brethren; I have made thus bold, not only to oppose them, but have allso presumed to dedicate the same to your Noble Excellency, in regard they have led me in such presumption: That so your Excellency, if time permit, might judge of the truth, as you find it to appear; and not so much as seem to patronize or coun∣tenance any grosse errours, or absurd tenents and expres∣sions, farre unsuitable for eminent Christians; A brief survey whereof your Excellency may find after the Treatise; the which, if possible, I earnestly desire your Excellency would read, when time will permit from your important businesse, if you cannot find time to read the other, that so you might see how farre it is pos∣sible for a whole Church to erre, and that in Fundamen∣talls. Thus briefly, lest I should seem tedious, I com∣mit you to the government of the Spirit of Truth, who dwelleth in you, and hath given you faith to go on still,
conquering and to conquer, and that on the Lambs side, togerher with them that are with him, the called, and chosen, and faithfull: And rest, earnestly desiring, that you may ride on prosperously in the waies of Truth, and Meeknesse, and Righteousnesse; Who is your Souldier and Servant allso, in what you please to com∣mand,
