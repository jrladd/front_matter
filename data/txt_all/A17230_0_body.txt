BEing perswaded (Right Noble Ladie) by some friends, for
publike bene∣fit to make this Collecti∣on of words common, which at first was
inten∣ded onely for priuate vse, (as written in my youth, at the request of
a worthy Gentleman, one whose loue preuailed much with me) I could not finde
in heart to send it forth, no better furnished than with a bare Title;
lest like an vnknowne Infant, it should be exposed to ouer hard vsage,
or per∣aduenture scornefully reiected, aduenturing abroad without countenance
of any friend or commaunder. Vpon sure knowledge there∣fore of
your most honourable disposition, and former experience of your
Ladyships fa∣uour toward me, I am emboldned to present this little Pamphlet
vnto your Honour, with hope that by your Patronage it shall not one∣ly bee
protected from iniuries, but also finde fauourable entertainment, and perhaps
grace∣fully admitted among greatest Ladies and studious Gentlewomen, to
whose reading (I am made beleeue) it will not prooue altoge∣ther vngratefull.
And although I may well be taxed of folly or presumption, that for cre∣dit of
a slender trifle, craue the assistance of so eminent a Person, yet
such (I confesse) is my care thereof (since I must not deny it for my
owne) and my duty and deuotion so affected to your Honour, and all yours;
that I haue, (hoping of your Ladishps pardon) wilfullie repelled al reasons
which might disswade me, choosing herein not so much what may seem
most seemly, as what I suppose most behooue∣full for me.
Accept therefore I beseech your Honour, and receiue vnder your
noble tuition this lit∣tle vocabulary Treatise, which hauing beene many
yeares restrained of libertie, is now glad of enlargement, especially
recommended vn∣to so worthy a Patronesse. The glorious Sun loseth not the least point of his heighth by li∣liberall lending
downe his light, and quicke∣ning with his influence the lowest creatures;
neither is any eminency disgraced, that easily condescendeth to others
desired good: which is also confirmed by the Poet, who saieth; 
Conspicitur nunquam meliore potentia causa,
Quàm quoties vanas non sinit esse
preces.
Not thinking needfull therefore to trouble your Honour with many
words of entreatie (vpon assured confidence of your wel known Charitie and
goodnesse) I conclude, sincerely wishing to your Ladiship, the best
that may be wished, and resting my selfe euer,
