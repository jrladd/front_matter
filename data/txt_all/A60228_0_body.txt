My Lord,
THis Translation makes its first ad∣dresse to your Honour's Accurat judgment, but craves no protecti∣on for the Matter, or Expressions of the Originall; For, the Matter is but the result of your Reasonings; and the Expressions, but the repetition of your Eloquence. In th'Author, two things, besides his exact knowledge in Civill and Divine affairs, are very remarkable; his Love to Truth, and Hatred to Detraction: As to Truth, he holds it forth, as the best & most permanent Policy for Princes, and their Ministers of State. Buy the Truth, but sell it not, saies Solomon. Magna est Veritas, & praevalebit. As to Detraction, he condemns the practice of it in all persons, and gives th'example t'others. For he is sparing in the discovery of some sharp Truths, and permits the Matter, Errours, or Crimes, to pub∣lish the men. And it were to be wished, that perso∣nall obloquie were not as modeable in our daies, as new dresses.

 In the businesse of Religion, he may be found zealous, but not superstitious, and rather of the Gallican, then Papall perswasion. Deceits and Vi∣ces are decryed by him, in what subject soever he finds them; Piety and Vertue highly exalted. For he made them, if report be true, his daily exercise; as knowing, that nothing can be perpetuall, but what is founded upon Piety or Vertue: for they are equall in the Ballance, when Vices endure no equality. And being bred in the School of that emi∣nent and successfull Cardinall of Richlieu, and cheri∣shed in his Conversation and House, did collect the most resined products of his Policy, Wit, and Ex∣perience, and gather the choicest Flowers of his Garden.
The Book had a very high esteem in France, at the publication in Paris, and hath justified its cre∣dit in the present use, as an approved Jewell; and it cannot go lesse in value here, where Learning and good Wits abound, and the judgment of discer∣ning a true Diamond from a Pibble stone, though never so well set; equall, if not superiour, to any Nation of the World.

My Lord,
Forgive th'excercise of your patience so long, in the Porch of this beautifull and regular Edifice, raised from the materialls of the Brain, and ador∣ned with the Beauties of Rhetorick, and Examples drawn to the life. But the Key being now in your hand, your Lordship may enter at pleasure, and dismisse,
My Lord,
