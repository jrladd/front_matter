Right Honourable,
THe Author of this Discourse sent it over from New-England, without a Title, without a Dedication. The Title is supplyed: And now I make bold to supply the Dedication, by publishing the Book under your Honours Name and Patronage; which I suppose the Author himself would do, if he were here pre∣sent, in regard of that neer dependence which his Reverend and Learned Father once had upon your Lordships Honour∣able Father of Renowned Memory,
Mr. Robert Parker that fa∣mous Divine, whom the Prelates persecu∣ted out of the Land, for oppo∣sing their Ceremo∣nies, espe∣cially the Crosse in Baptism. from whom he received his whole Livelyhood; besides many other great and extraordinary Fa∣vours which his Wife and Children talk of to this very day. I will not go about to commend the Work, which doth sufficiently com∣mend it Self and the Workman too; of whose worth I could speak much, if I were not so neerly allied unto him as I am: Onely this I will say, (which all that are well acquainted with him know to be true) He is a man of singular parts, eminent in Learning, superemi∣nent in Grace, strangely mortified to the World, wholly addicted to the Service God and the Church. So craving pardon for my great boldnesse in approaching so neer, being but a stranger, I humbly take my leave, and desire to approve my self
 Jan. 7. 1646.
