My Lord and Gentlemen,
HAving spent some time in looking over the hi∣stories of Nations, our own Records, and Sta∣tutes, with severall other works of Statists, Po∣litians Lawyers, I found that saying truly verified of Solomon▪ In much wisdome is much grief, and he that increa∣seth knowledge increaseth sorrow; and what he afterward concludes of all his own works and labour, I observed to be most true in them, touching Polities and civil go∣vernment, Behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. For indeed men have a∣cted and written either in reference to Princes, to hu∣mor and please their lusts and will, or like the unwise builder (the blind leading the blind) have built upon the sand, upon unsound bottomes and false principles. And therefore as Christ in the controversie betweene him and the Pharisees touching divorce, sends them back to the originall and first institution of marriage, and to the Fathers of the first age of the world, as being the first and best pattern; and Paul to reform the abuses in the Lords Supper, cals them Corinthians to the first in∣stitution. So there is no better way to have a Common-wealth

setled in peace and righteousnesse, then to look back at the beginning, when men walked by the exact and even rules of equity, justice, conscience, and kept the clear and plain principles of reason and nature: this is the Land-measure and Standard whereby the faulty measures coming after are to be corrected and amen∣ded.
How this light first came to be less'ned, and then by degrees afterwards upon the matter quite extinguish∣ed in some Kingdomes, and darknesse to break in, as Soveraignities, Monarchies, Kings prerogatives, arbi∣trary power, regal immunities, Crownes hereditary and successive, &c. (all bloody and black Characters of Tyrants and conquest) it is easie to be seen, and I shall shortly (by the good hand of God assisting me) give you and the whole Nation good satisfaction.
In the mean time I have thought good to publish this small Treatise, and howsoever I question not, but your present work and way is clear to you, yet to the nation generally it may serve in some good stead, as to satisfie the weaker, confirm the stronger, informe the ignorant, and leave the wilfull and obstinate without excuse.
For the man with whom I deal, I have nothing here to say, neither indeed would I have sayd any thing to his work, considering what for a man he is, but that I perceived it was in the mouth of some, much cried up, people it seemes, that are not able to put a distinction between wind and words, nor know any difference be∣tween rayling and reason.
And now my Lord and Gentlemen, upon you at the present is the eye of the nation: you are as a city set up∣on a hil, all Kingdoms about us, are looking on you, and

great things are hoped for, and exspected from you, and this I must needs tell you, the cause of Christ lies much now upon your actings, if you doe the worke of the Lord negligently, unfaithfully, fearfully, oh my bowels doe yearn, and I tremble to think what disho∣nor will come to Gods great name, what scandal and proach to the glorious Gospel, what sadnes and sorrow too the soules of the righteous, and what tryumph and joy there will be in the tents of wicked men. But I hope better things of you, though I thus speak, I need not tell you how much you have seen of God, and how his powerfull presence hath gone all along with you to this present time, neither need I tell you by what a strong arm and a strange providence you have beene brought up to this work. But if you should now ask of me (as the young man did of Christ) what lack we yet? I would say, constancy and faithfulnesse to the end will crown, not only this, but all your former actions.
Methinks I could say more to you, then Mordecai did to Hester, Who knowes whether thou art come to the Kingdom for such a time as this? We know, (and blessed be God for it) the Lord hath made you his Israels Saviours, and by you hath wrought deliverance for his people, he hath put much glory already upon you, now therfore stand fast, quit your selves like men, you have the prayers of the Saints with you and for you; and for the enemies their defence is departed from them; and the Lord is with you, fear them not.
But seeing the Treatise is short, I shall not make too large a forespeech: I well remember your expression in the Remonstrance, calling upon every man to contribute what help he can; and truly there is all the reason in the world for it, that every one now should lay himself out to

further so honorable and good a work. And for my part according to the small portion I have received I shall not be wanting in your vindication, but for the things by you proposed, and your prosecuting of them; to wit, that the King may be brought to his tryal, the enemies of our peace punished, hurtfull Laws nullified the peoples grievances and oppressions removed, free∣dom and liberty of conscience (without danger to the State) granted, & a better form of Government setled, as I shall undertake the just defence thereof, so I shall shortly make it more manifest to the whole nation, that there is nothing in all things desired of you, nor pro∣secuted by you, but what is according to justice, reason, nature conscience, and what the Lord himself doth al∣low and call for: In the mean time my prayer shall be for the blessing of God to be upon your labor, and his powerfull protection over your Persons: Sirs I am
