Right Noble and R. Vertuous,
YOu were pleased to put into my hands a Jewell of great price, your onely Child, I received him with joy, I lost him with griefe. Vpon this paper I have spent more teares than inke, sighs than sentences: could my groanes have fetch'd him, the grave had yeelded him. But now, you and I must learne, (God prosper the
Lesson) Wee must goe to him, hee cannot returne to us: God hath ta∣ken but his owne, and wee may not murmure; my love to the deceased, my devotednesse to You, hath drawne into view the substance of five houres medi∣tation, and those distracted with sorrows: as love hath composed these lines, so love, I trust, will shelter them: if I may doe any thing to You acceptable, to the memory of my Jewell friendly, that day in all my life shall be accounted by me a great day; for no longer shall I live, than I shall also live
