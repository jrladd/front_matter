Right Worshipful,
THO' I am too conscious of my own weakness and inability to perform any thing worthy of your Acceptance: who are bless'd with many Lear∣ned and Loyal Clergy-men, that entertain you with more polite Discourses; yet I dare not say but that I did most chearfully comply with the Commands

of many Considerable Persons, for publishing this Discourse; not only because it will be a Testimony of your Respects to so mean an Orator: but because it will be an Evidence of this Cities Duty and Affection to the King, of which no City in England hath given more chearful and ample demonstrati∣ons.
It is but a while since (as your Worships all sorrowfully remember) that Loyal and Conscientious Subjects, had like to have been overborn by the inundation of Popular Clamours, and the ranco∣rous breaths of the Factious Mobile: but tho' this Disease had spread its Contagion into too many great Bodies of this Kingdom, and the Tyde of Rebellion grew very high and threatning in this City also; yet did your Extraordinary Care and Vigilance Antitode the Infection, Stem the impetu∣ous Torrent, and maugre all the Designs of an Antimonarchical Faction, preserve this City in Loyalty and Obedience. Which that you may always do, to the Honour of God that Commands it, to the Safety of the King that Deserves it, and your own Eternal Felicity that Endeavour it, is the Prayer of
Right Worshipful,

July, 26. 1683.
