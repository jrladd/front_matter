Madam,
THese Notes being taken from the Pul∣pit to my hand, I could not well with∣stand the importu∣nity of some friends, who de∣sired
my consent for the print∣ing of them; I must confesse the conceptions so farre as they are mine; were sudden and in∣digested, and I have had scarce time by meanes of continual diversions, to correct material mistakes; much lesse to enlarge or perfect the Notes; howe∣ver if they may be of use to any that may have leisure to cast an eye upon them, it shall abundantly preponderate the censure which their defects may justly incurre. Whatever they are, I shall confidently pro∣mise a gracious acceptance with your honour, who were pleased to encourage them in the Pul∣pit,
with your Christian atten∣tion. They are yours by many engagements; not only upon my selfe, but the whole parish on whom your munificence hath laid so many and deep obligations. Your transcendent bounty at the re-building of the Church-Edifice; the Rich Vessels of plate, wherewith your Ladi∣ship hath furnished the Lords Table. Your purchase of the rever∣si of an house, for the succes∣sive Ministery of this place, and in the interim your charge, inbuying off a considerable part of the rent, during the present owners life. These with ma∣ny other publick exhibitions of
your pious charity, will stand as so many monuments of your goodnesse to posterity, and render your name Honourabl to after-generations. Your coun∣tenance vouchsafed to my per∣son and Ministery, since my call to this place, with the many renewed expressions of your undeserved favour, oblige me to the best service within my capacity. And because I de∣spaire of opportunitie suit∣able to mine own wishes, and your merit; I have made bold to close with this slender advan∣tage of testifying to the world my deep sense of your multipli∣ed respects to this place, and the
Ministery of the Gospel. And that the Father of mercies, will returne all your love with a rich recompence of reward both of grace and glory, shall be the ear∣nest prayer,
Madam,
