Most Gracious Soveraigns,
AMidst the throng of those weigh∣ty and impor∣tant Cares that fill Your Royal Breasts,

it is indeed a high pre∣sumption, in one so in∣considerable as I am, to offer the interrup∣ting them by this Ad∣dress. But since such is your Royal Cle∣mency, as not to deny Access to the meanest of Your Subjects, Per∣mit me, with awful Reverence and Humi∣lity, to lay the ensuing Narrative at Your Majesties Feet, with

hopes You will vouch∣safe to shelter it under Your Royal Patro∣nage.
The deplorable and miserable Condition, wherein many of Your Majesties Subjects, with other Christians, now lie groaning in Slave∣ry, and under the bar∣barous Tyranny and Inhumanity of Mully Ishmael Emperor of

Morocco, is a Subject that may perhaps not altogether be thought unworthy the Cogni∣zance of Your Maje∣sties; it being mani∣fest to all the World how much it has been the Glorious Design of Your Majesties whole Life and Reign, to set Mankind at Liberty, and to free the Distres∣sed from the Yoke of Tyranny and Oppres∣sion.

May that Al∣mighty Hand that has framed Your Maje∣sties for the Support and Joy of the Uni∣verse, continue to Crown all Your Affairs with uninterrupted Success, giving You more and more the Hearts of Your Subjects, and the Necks of Your Ene∣mies. And after Your Majesties have reaped many Harvests of

Lawrels, may You plant such an Olive of Peace, under the Bran∣ches whereof all Eu∣rope may for successive Ages rejoice.
