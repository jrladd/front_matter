WE may observe the Happiness
or Unhappiness that waits up∣on
this Life, are most com∣monly
owing to the Vigilent and Indu∣strious,
or the careless and ungovern'd
Actions of our Youth; and as the for∣mer
lays a probable Foundation, upon
which (by a continued Care) we may
build our succeeding Fortunes to a com∣fortable
height, so the latter robs us of
that Substance upon which we ought
(for our Security) to place the Pedestal
of our future Prosperity: And as there

is nothing tends more to the Destruction
of Youth, or renders them more inca∣pable
of considering their own Welfare,
than the Conversation of Intrieguing
Women: I thought, Young Men, I could
not do you a greater Service in this Age,
where to tempt cunningly, and deceive
slily, are the Study of the Female Sex,
than present you with a small Pocket-piece,
which shall serve as Armour to
defend you from the Darts thrown from
Wanton and Designing Women, whose evil
Communication corrupts good Manners,
and will make you (if deluded by them)
Disobedient to the Laws of GOD, un∣dutiful
Children to your Parents, unjust
Servants to your Masters, ill Husbands
(when you Marry) to your Wives, ba
Fathers to your Children, Enemies to
your Countrey, and Slaves to others, as
well as to your own Vices. There is
nothing more evident, than that several
Young Men in this City of London have
been drawn aside, to their Ruin, by the
attractive Sorcery of these bewitching

Load-stones, which having been observ'd
of late by the Right Honourable the
Mayors, and other the Iustices of London,
that they have been so commendably In∣dustrious
in suppressing this Vice, within
the Bounds of their Jurisdiction, that
it is a hard matter for a Night-walking
Strumpet to strole through the City un∣punish'd.
The Magistrates have done
their Parts, and nothing is requir'd fur∣ther,
(for the more effectual Promotion
of the City's Glory) but your Care to
avoid the Lust and Subtilty of those
private Madams, whose gay Apparel, and
false Pretence to Modesty, gives them
Covert in reputable Families, where they
heard with the Vertuous, declaim against
the Vices of the Age, and seem to won∣der
at that Wickedness in others, which
themselves do practice daily, to maintain
their Pride.
I have therefore Taught you how to
know these Vultures in Peacocks Plumes,
and how to avoid them, and how to
converse with them without Prejudice

in the following Treatise, which I dedi∣cate
to your View, and commend to
your Practice, as you are the Flower of
our Nation, and Glory of the Metro∣polis;
to whom
