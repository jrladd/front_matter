Right Honourable,
THat former Narative called, The clear Sunshine of the Gospel, breaking forth upon the Indians in New England; dedicated to your Honours by divers Reverend and eminent Ministers of the Gospell in and about the City of London, found such ac∣ceptance in your House, as it begat a debate amongst your selves, how the parliament of England might be serviceable to the Lord Je∣sus, to help forward such a work begun; which conduced so abundantly to the glory of God, and good of men in the salvation of their soules. And in order thereunto your Honours were pleased to refer it to the Committee of forraign plantations, to prepare and bring in an Ordinance for the en∣couragement and advancement of Learning and

Piety in New England, as appeareth by your Or∣der March 17. 1647. This Honourable Com∣mittee with great readiness and chearfulness took it into their serious consideration, and presented the result of their mature debates to this honoura∣ble House: But so many and weighty have been the occasions and businesses of the House, that however the nature of the work and my duty (be∣ing appointed Agent though unworthy) on the behalf of New-England to this Parliament: yet durst not presse too hard to interrupt the great affaires your Honours have been in hand withall. Nevertheles, I do now crave leave, humbly to acquaint you, that what was then judged defici∣ent in the power granted to the Feoffees in that Ordinance, is since corrected and amended, and attendeth your Honours leisure for compleating and finishing the same.
Undoubtedly the common enemy of mans sal∣vation hath rejoyced that this work so happily begun, hath not as yet received that countenance and encouragement from hence, which your Ho∣nours intended and resolved many months since. Nevertheles, I trust the most wise God hath tur∣ned this appearing losse into gaine, by affording your Honours and the Nation a more clear ac∣count of the reall and glorious Progres of the

Gospel among those poor Indians in AMERICA, by such Intelligence I very lately received from thence, under the hands of those Reverend & lear∣ned Ministers, which are principally employed in preaching the Gospel to them in their own Lan∣guage. And as I am daily and earnestly called up∣on to publish the same, that the whole Nation may be acquainted therewith: So I took it to be my duty to present it in the first place to this ho∣nourable House, and the Councel of State; that your Honours might perceive how these poor Creatures cry out for help; Oh come unto us, teach us the knowledge of God, tarry longer with us, come and dwell amongst us, at least depart not so soon from us. And others of them whose dwellings are near the Habitations of the Eng∣lish, (whose hearts God hath touched) calling for and demanding a free and full participation of all the Ordinances of Jesus Christ All which, and much more is evidently held forth in the follow∣ing Narrative, which I have with all faithfulnes collected and transcribed, according as I received the same from persons that were Actors there∣in, and are of known Integrity.
There are two great questions Right Honou∣rable, which have much troubled ancient and

modern writers, and men of greatest depth and a∣bility to resolve: the first, what became of the ten Tribes of Israel, that were carried into Cap∣tivity by the King of Siria, when their own Coun∣trey and Cities were planted and filled with strangers? The second is, what Family, Tribe, Kin∣dred, or people it was that first planted, and after∣wards filled that vast and long unknown Coun∣trey of America? Now however I confesse questi∣ons are sooner asked then resolved; yet let me ac∣uaint your Honors, that a godly Minister of this City writing to Rabbi-ben-Israel, a great Dr. of the Jewes, now living at Amsterdam, to know whether after all their labor, travells, and most di∣ligent enquiry, they did yet know what was be∣come of the ten Tribes of Israel? His answer was to this effect, if not in these words, That they were certainly transported into America, and that they had infallible tokens of their being there. Unto which if I may take the boldnesse to adde what my self, with many others in New England have observed in the practice of the Indians there, in relation to some things enjoyned in the ceremo∣niall Law of Moses, about the purification of weomen, which no men at this day do observe, no beside the Jewes were ever known in that

strictness to observe, as these Indians there daily do: As also if the principles of the most grave and sober amongst them, not only in reference to a Deity, the soule of man, the immortality of the soule, and an eternity after death in happines or misery; but also their manifold daily expressions, bewailing the losse of that knowledge their An∣cestors had about God, and the way of his Wor∣ship; the general deluge, and of one man only that ever saw God, which they hold forth to be a long time since, (even with the greatest expression of length of time that may be) which certainly I believe to be Moses. As also if many other Cir∣cumstances well known to many, (but not fit to be at large expressed in any Epistle) be duly con∣sidered, It is not lesse probable that these Indi∣ans should come from the Stock of Abraham, then any other Nation this day known in the world: Especially considering the juncture of time wherein God hath opened their hearts to enter tain the Gospel, being so nigh the very years, in which many eminent and learned Divines, have from Scripture grounds, according to their ap∣prehensions foretold the conversion of the Iewes. However Right Honourable, the work of com∣municating and encreasing the light of the Gos∣pel

is glorious in reference to Iewes & Gentiles. And as God hath set a signall marke of his pre∣sence upon your Assembly, in strengthning your hands to redeem and preserve the civill Rights of the Common-weale: so doubtlesse may it be a comfortable support to your Honours in any future difficulties, to contemplate, that as the Lord offered you (in this designe) an happy op∣portunity to enlarge and advance the Territories of his Sonnes Kingdom: So he hath not deny∣ed you (as I am confident he will not) an heart to improve the same; and in as much as lies in you to make all the Nations of the Earth, the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ; that so your Honours may still preserve your interest in his favour, which is and shall be the prayers of
