MADAME, Since by the instinct of Nature, all things acknovvledge the Fountayne, vvhence originally they flovv: I
should haue vvronged this Excellent TREA∣TISE, had I directed the same, into any other, then your LADIS∣HIPPS Hands, from vvhome I first receaued it; and to vvhome, by the TRANSLA∣TOVRS Intention, and for many other respects, it is singularly due.
And although, this be but a small Part, or one single Tracte only, of the admirable VVOR∣KES of the Authour; yet
hath it byn iudged fit, to be published alone; to the end the pious Reader may not be depriued of so Excellent a Treasure, vntill the ƲƲhole may come to light. And I doubt not, but that the printing of this, vvilbe no small Motiue to the ƲƲorthy TRANS∣LATOVR, to go for∣vvard vvith the rest; see∣ing his former Deuout Labours, in furthering of Spirituall Matters, are highly esteemed, & ho∣noured
by all pious, and vnpartiall Readers ther∣of.
In this Treatise (MA∣DAME) may the De∣uout Contemplant, read vvithout ƲƲearinesse, & repeat vvithout Tedious∣nesse; sucking euermore from hence, most svveet Delightes of Diuine Cō∣fort; the vvhich do so sa∣tiate, as they procure also nevv Appetite, in those, vvho addict themselues to the practice of MEN¦TAL PRAYER.

For, amongst all the Spirituall BOOKES, novv extant, I knovv not any one, more generally Applauded, or accoun∣ted more Necessary, for such, as attend to the de∣uout Exercise of Prayer, then this: The AƲ∣THOVR vvherof, ha∣uing byn not only tray∣ned vp, all his life tyme, in the Schoole of ƲER∣TƲE; but also, one of the most expert Mai∣sters of SPIRIT, that are knovvne, at this day,
in the Christian vvorld.
Vnto this Tracte of MENTAL PRAY∣ER, haue I adioyned an∣other more briefe, Of the Presence of God, made by the same AVTHOVR. For, as these tvvo pious Exercises, haue such de∣pendance one of the o∣ther, that they cannot be separated in Practice: So vvas it thought conue∣nient, to combine them togeather in one Booke; that the same might be more entierely vsefull,
for the arriuing vnto a true, and perfect Spirit of Deuotion, & Ʋnion vvith God.
I vvill not enter into further Discourse, in pray∣se heerof; as vvell, not to be ouer-tedious to your LADISHIPPE; as not to hinder you from enioying the svveet Con∣tent, vvhich you vvill (no doubt) receaue, by the Perusall. As for the small Paines, I may haue taken in the publishing of it, the Benefit vvhich many
soules vvill reape heere∣by, shalbe my Comfort; and my poore Prayers shall euer be attending You, for the perpetuall Increase of your spiritu∣all Happines: Whereof I humbly beseech You, to make him Partaker, vvho hath dedicated Himselfe, to remayne euer,
