May it please Your HIGHNESS,
THE Consideration of my own Unworthiness, and obscure Condi∣tion, would easily check my Thoughts from the Presumption of trou∣bling your Illustrious Eye with these

mean Lines, did not Your Princely Cle∣mency and the nature of the thing make such Address in some respect necessary.
For since 'tis Eminently known, that Your Highness hath, not onely by most excellent Conduct, and personal Hazards in War, given Matchless Proofs of Your great zeal for the Safety and Glory of the English Nation; but also by the prudence of Your Counsels endeavoured ever to promote its Welfare, by discovering and cherishing useful Arts, and profitable In∣ventions, and incouraging all things that tend to its Honour, Wealth, and Prospe∣rity, though tendred by the lowest and never so despicable Instruments: for which publick-spirited Generosity Your Highness justly merits much more Honour and Applause, than my weak Capacity is able to express.
Whether then should these unpolish'd

Papers (wherein I have with more Affe∣ction than Encouragement) endeavour∣ed to propose some Expedients tending to this Kingdoms future happiness, fly for shelter in this slothful envious Age (wherein many that will never study any thing for general Good themselves, are too ready to crush, abuse, and misrepresent those that do) but to Your Highnesses Protection, who are Ennobled with the clearest Judgment to Censure, and the most obliging Candor to pardon them.
At Your Highness's feet I therefore cast them with all humble submission, and if in any part they shall obtain the Ho∣nour of your Princely Approbation, and be thought fit to be Encouraged in the least, as conducing to general Good, I shall not afterwards fear the Censures of Envy, but sit down secure in the Con∣science of having endeavour'd to be

serviceable (to my weak power) to my Countrey, and the happiness I have here∣by to declare my self
