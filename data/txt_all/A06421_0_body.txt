SIR,
PArdon, I beseech You, this bold presumption, which proceed I confesse from som∣what more than that com∣mon duty wherewith all of Vs gladly reverence and respect You: not that I arrogate unto my selfe any interest be∣fore others, but confesse my selfe so farre in∣debted to your favours, that my thankful∣nesse cannot willingly omit the occasion of expressing it selfe, although but in a meane and homely manner, unto one, to whom I not only acknowledge, but glory that I owe my selfe. This hath emboldned mee to the dedication of these few Dialogues, which

will I hope, at some of your times of recrea∣tion, obtaine a favourable admittance, partly for the generall esteeme of the Author; with whom I know, your yonger studies have beene conversant, and somewhat for the Translators sake, one not altogether un∣knowne unto you, that to my knowledge truly honoured you, and whom you may better know in this, than many that were well acquainted with him in his life time, in both which respects these Dialogues humbly implore your patronage, as one most able both to judge and defend them, which if you will vouchsafe, and suffer this poore orphane to passe under the shadow of Your favourable protection, I shall ac∣count that small paines I have taken in publishing it hapily imployed, the ashes of my deare deceased father highly honourd, and my selfe (if it be possible) more obli∣ged to a perpetuall acknowledgement of Your favours, and profession of my selfe for ever to remaine
