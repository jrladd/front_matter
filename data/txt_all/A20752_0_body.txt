MAnifold (right Worshipfull) and most daungerous are the temptations and assaults of our spirituall enemies, where∣by they labour to hinder the saluation of Gods elect, and to increase the greatnesse of their hellish dominions, by with∣drawing (if it were possible) Gods seruants from their subiection and alleageance, and making them their slaues and perpetuall vassals. To this end they take in∣defatigable paines, going continually about seeking whom they may deuour; sometimes like roaring Lions, compelling by violent force, and sometimes
like old Serpents, alluring and deceiuing with trea∣cherous policies. Neither doe they rest in the time of our rest, but waking and sleeping they set vpon vs, one while inticing vs to swallow the poyson of sinne, with the sugred baites of worldly vanities, and another while driuing vs into their snares of per∣dition, with the sharpe pricking goades of mise∣rie and affliction. Before vs they set carnall pleasures, deceiuing riches, and vaine honours, to allure vs to come into the broad way that leadeth to destructi∣on: and behind vs they hold the three-stringed whip of losse, shame, and punishment, to keepe vs from go∣ing backe, and to hasten vs with winged speede to run forward in this hellish iourney. Neither do they greatly care what path we chuse in this common way of perdition; whether the spatious way of secu∣ritie and presumption, or the strait path of horror and desperation, whether the toyling way of vnsati∣able couetousnesse, or the soft faire way of bewitch∣ing pleasures, whether the open way of worldlinesse and atheisme, or through the hidden thickets of hy∣pocrisie and dissimulation: in a word they regard not in what way we walke, so we goe forward in the waies of sinne, for though they seeme diuers and contrarie one to another, yet they haue all the same end, meeting together in hell and destruction. And howsoeuer they cannot with all their malice, power and policies attaine vnto their desires, by bringing Gods elect and faithfull ones to perdition and end∣lesse miserie; because God their heauenly father who hath taken vpon him their protection, frustra∣teth all their subtill policies with his all-seeing wife∣dome, and withstandeth all their might with his al∣mightie
power, yet doe they exceedingly with their assaults and temptations, foyle, vexe and trouble them; by working in some, forgetfulnesse of God and of themselues, securitie, and carelesse retchles∣nesse; and turmoyling others with horrible feares, desperat doubting, and bitter agonies. Whereby it commeth to passe, that the one sort securely goe on in sinne, forgetting the end of their creation, re∣demption, and holy vocation, vnto which God hath called them, vntill with Salomon they haue found in the end of their worldly delights, nothing but vani∣tie and vexation of spirit: and the other are so af∣frighted, astonished, and continually tormented with doubtings, feares, and the continuall assaults of their spirituall enemies, that they goe mourning all the day long, pining away in griefe and anguish of mind, till at last they grow wearie of their liues, thinking their soules an intollerable burthen to their bodies, and their bodies to the earth. The consideration of which lamentable and too too miserable effects, as it shall moue all christians to stand vpon their guard, and to arme themselues with the spirituall armour, that they may not be ouercome of their temptations, and fall into these great mischiefes: so should it moue Gods faithfull ministers (whose dutie it is, not onely themselues to walke in the waies of righteousnesse, but also as spirituall guides to leade others with them) in discharge of their conscience before God, and in christian commiseration and compassion to∣wards their brethren, to vse all good meanes both by speaking and writing, whereby they may bee pre∣serued and freed from these snares which their spi∣rituall enemies doe lay to intrap them; by beating
downe with the cannon-shot of Gods threatnings, the high forts of their proud presumption, and rou∣zing them out of the deepe slumber of retchlesse securitie; as also by raising vp and comforting those that mourne in Syon, stooping, yea lying groueling vnder the heauie burthen of their sinnes. The which howsoeuer it is performed by many, in respect of their seuerall charges committed to them; and some also haue briefely touched some poynts in writing, which concerned the comforting and raising vp of their priuate friends: yet not any (that I know of) haue in our language largely and generally handled these controuersies, and spirituall conflicts betweene the christian and the enemies of his saluation, for the common good of the whole Church. And there∣fore hauing with Elihu long waited to see if those who were more auncient, better experienced, and more richly furnished with Gods gifts and graces than my selfe, would vndertake this worke, which is to God most acceptable, and to his saints and chil∣dren so profitable and necessarie: at length after others long silence, I resolued to speake, and no lon∣ger to conceale such true comforts as God hath re∣uealed vnto me; to the end that hereby I might re∣leeue and comfort those who are poore in spirit, and humbled in the sight of sinne; or at least by offering willingly to this vse my small mite, I might giue an occasion vnto others better able, to vnlocke and open their rich treasuries, that they may bestow vpon their poore brethren their great talents and gifts of better valew. The which my labors as I did not rashly vn∣dertake them, so I haue not suddenly finished them; for almost three yeeres since I purposed to take this
worke in hand, which I haue now by Gods assistance finished; but at the first (I confesse) I intended not that it should come in to publike view; but onely (as others before me) propounded as the end of my labours, the comforting and raising vp of a most faithfull seruant of God, and my most deare friend, who hath bound me with many benefits to the per∣formance of all christian duties. But afterwards fin∣ding it to grow to such a volume that it was too great to passe in a written coppie, and hoping that that which was profitable for one might bee be∣neficiall vnto many, at length I resolued to make my labours publike by committing them to the presse. The principall things that I propounded to my selfe in this treatise are these; first and especi∣ally I indeauour to comfort those who are afflicted in conscience, in the sight and sence of their sinnes, by offering vnto them certaine assurance, that their sinnes are remitted, and that themselues are elected to eternall life, in the state of grace, reconciled vnto God in Christ and receiued in his loue and fauour. Secondly, I labour to leade the christian in an euen course, vnto the hauen of eternall happinesse; that he may not runne aside, neither on the right hand, and so falling vpon the rockes of presumption make shipwracke of his soule, nor yet on the left hand, and so plunge himselfe into the gulfe of desperation. Wherein I haue purposely and aduisedly auoyded their practise, who scatter their consolations they know not where, to bee applyed they care not by whom; whereof it commeth to passe that those that are most secure and presumptuous arrogate them, to whom they doe not appertaine; and those that
are afflicted and humbled dare not appropriate them to themselues, because they are deliuered indefinitly to all, without all caution or any condition, where∣by they might bee restraied rather to them than any other in whom sinne yet liueth and raigneth. Wherein they resemble negligent physitions, who hauing made a good medicine for a sicke man, doe not giue it vnto him, but cast it carelesly into some corner, whether the sicke patient in respect of his faintnesse and weakenesse is likely neuer to come: which being found and greedily drunken vp by those who haue no neede of it, in stead of doing them good doth turne to their baine and vtter de∣struction. Lastly, I haue desired to giue solid and substantiall consolations, which are firmely groun∣ded vpon Gods vndoubted truth, and such infallible reasons as cannot bee gainsaid; and haue withall deliuered the conditions, vpon which they are to be receiued, and the vndoubted signes and markes of those, to whom of right they appertaine; to the end that those who finde these things in themselues, may not doubt to apply them to their wounded consci∣ences, whereby they may bee soundly cured and throughly comforted; and that those who finde no such condition obserued by them, nor any such signe or marke in them, may be debarred from participa∣ting of these consolations, which would nourish in them securitie and presumption: and contrariwise examining themselues according to these rules, and finding no correspondencie betweene themselues and them, may hereby be awakened out of their le∣thargie of securitie, and attaining vnto a sight and sense of their miserable estate may neuer be at rest,
till by vsing all good meanes for this purpose, they may finde these markes and signes of their election, vocation, iustification, and sanctification in them, that so they may boldly and fitly apply vnto themselues these comforts and consolations as rightly and truly appertaining vnto them. All which my labours I thought good to dedicate vnto your worships, part∣ly because I desired to giue this testimonie of my true thankefulnesse, for those manifold benefits which from some of you I haue receiued, and of mine vnfained loue which I beare to you all, for your vertues and approued godlinesse; and partly be∣cause I thought none fitter to whom I might com∣mend this discourse of the Christian Warfare, than your selues who are olde experienced souldiars in fighting these spirituall battailes, and therefore haue iudiciall feeling and sensible apprehension, of those things which I haue written and commended to your patronage. Now the Lord our God who is the fountaine of all goodnesse, and the sole giuer of all true consolation, increase in you more and more the gifts and graces of his sanctifying spirit, and so fill your hearts with all sound spirituall comfort, and the ioy in the holy Ghost, that you may through the course of your whole liues, chearefully goe forward in the profession and sincere practise of his religion and true godlinesse, and after this life may receiue that crowne of righteounsnesse, which is prepared and laid vp for you in his kingdome of eternall glorie. Amen.
