DIvorc'd by Death, but wedded still by love,
(For love by Death can never be divorced)
Loe Englands Dragon, thy true turtle Dove,
To seeke her make is now againe enforced.
Like as the Sparrow from the Castrels ire
Made his Asylum in the wise-mans fist:
So he, and I his tongues-man, doe require
Thy sanctuarie, Envie to resist.
So may heroique DRAKE, whose worth gave wings
Vnto my Muse that nere before could flie,
And taught her tune these harsh discordant strings,
A note above her rurall minstralsie,
Live in himselfe, and I in him may live,
Thine eies to both vitalitie shall give.
