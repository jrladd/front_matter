Honoured SIR,
I Have hitherto had so small Encouragement for pub∣lishing my good Affections both to Church and State; that upon just Grounds I had resolved to adven∣ture no more on the Press: For though I never gave way to the Printing of more Sermons then two, the former out of a
 sincere desire to have prevented the late Commotions; and the latter to promote His MAIESTIES just Restitution) Yet all the thankes I reaped (such was then the ini∣quitie of the Times) was, to be committed to Newgate for both; and this unequal Re∣tribution for so pious intentions and peace∣able endeavours, had rendred me very un∣willing to appear again in Print. Yet be∣ing lately appointed by my Lord Mayor (whose courage, and vigilancie make him fit for, and worthy of the grat trust which he now so faithfully dischargeth) to preach this Sermon; I have been in some sort enforced to publish it, partly to satisfie the incessant and unavoydable importunitie of many noble Friends, and well-affected Hearers; and partly to prevent being mis∣represented by such short-Writers, as hav∣ing taken my Notes, told me plainly, that if I would not print this Sermon, they would, in order to the publick good; so that I must needs say it is not entreated, but extorted; and yet I shall make this Vertue of that Necessity, to let the World
 see in this poor Dedication, not onely how grateful I desire to approve my self to your Honour, For your daily repeated Favours; but also that your Prudence and Integritie Candour and Charitie, are such a Muni∣ment, and Ornament to the Court, that they alone are sufficient both to defend it from Conspiracie, and to denominate it truely Christian.
Your Honour hath by many and many Acts acquired such an habit of doing what is just, and Right, that (as it was said of Cato) you cannot do otherwise. You dispatch State-affairs with so much inge∣nuitie, and dexteritie, that what other Po∣liticians Languished under as too hard a labour, is but your ordinarie Recreation; who have not onely learn't, (with The∣mistocles) but are able to teach the rea∣die way how to make a small Common-wealth great, and of a sick Bodie poli∣tick, a sound one: and your singular abilities will now as spectably appear in repairing our breaches, and healing our distempers, as the best Pilot's skill doth
 in a Storm, and the Gallantry of a Com∣mander in a Battle; though being a Star of the first Magnitude, the Greater you are, the less you seeme, by reason of the distance between you and us. All that know you, must acknowledge that no Prince ever had a more deserving, and obliging Servant, who preferres his Great Lord and Masters Honour, before his own Interest; and in these cloudie times to give him light, con∣sumes himself. In your single person his Sacred MAIESTY hath all the ad∣vantages of a Full and Faithful Councel. All your Oracles are so sweetly, and evenly tempered of Policie and Pietie, (your Honour being wise as a Serpent, Innocent as a Dove) that Josephs Character, in the 23. of Saint Luke, at the 50. is not onely proper to you but in some sence, peculiar, Viz. An honourable Counsellour, a good man and a just; one that consen∣ted not to the councell and deed of them, waiting for the Kingdome of God. Your own Laudable Actions commend you far beyond my invention, and expres∣sions;
 yet Gratitude prompts me to have added my Mite, to your gracious Trea∣surie, but that I have constantly observed that you had rather be, and do things, worthy of praise, then hear of either: And so not doubting that your Honour will as chearfully accept of this small pre∣sent, as you have been ever accustomed to do things great, and glorious; I humbly crave both your patronage and pardon for this pre∣sumption; and rest,
