MOre Rich-art thou in mind then Mynes,
but Myn-shall be the joy of heart;
Since still thy love with mine combines,
and smels of Nature more then Art:
For bloud with bloud, and sacred writ,
Such knots of love in Love hath knit.


To thee therefore J onely send,
this Spiders Web so vainely spunne,
Which my best thoughts to thee commend,
since what is done, for thee is done:
If any taxe my idle braine,
Say once a yeare fond fooles doe raigne.
