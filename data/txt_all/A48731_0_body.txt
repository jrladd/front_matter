GENTLEMEN,
IN Obedience to your Desires, I here present you with that Dis∣course of Mine, I lately enter∣tain'd you with: Mine, I say, such as it was, as I then de∣livered it in the Pulpit; but Yours now, such as it is, as it appears to the world from the Press. I could not but look upon it as a Testimony of great Respect, and I do with Thank-fulness acknowledge it, that

you should make choice of Me for opening the Scene of your anew-intended yearly Feast, after the interruption of above twenty years. Wherefore I thought fit to pitch my thoughts upon such a subject as might include most of those Ends, for which such Meetings should be designed. How well or ill I have handled it, I must leave to the judgment of the Pious and Ingenuous Reader.
If others shall find any Satisfaction or Be∣nefit in the perusal of This, whatever it be, they must owe it to You, who Desired, that is, Ordered me to throw it into the Publick; or if they meet with any thing that may Dissatisfie or Offend them, they ought out of Charity to Ex∣cuse Me, who could not but Obey.

Westminster, Iuly 22. 1680.
