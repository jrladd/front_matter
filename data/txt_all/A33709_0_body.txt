Honoured Sir,
DEdications are at this time grown so much in Fashion, that a Book which appears in the World without one, is scarce look'd upon by any body; people thinking that the Author, who
 omits a thing so generally practised, is altogether destitute of a Friend who is capable of protecting and countenancing him; and for that very reason only, let the merit of the Book be never so great, few people will give themselves the trou∣ble of Reading any more than the Title Page alone. To prevent which, and at the same time to manifest my Gratitude for the manifold Favours you have been pleas'd Generously to heap upon me, I have presumed to prefix your Name to the following Essay. I cannot flatter my self so far as to think there is any thing in it worthy to entertain a Person of Your
 Parts: But since it comes from one who is filled with a sense of Gratitude, I have some reason to hope, that it may meet with a kind Acceptance; I very well knowing, that small things have sometimes a Value set upon them, especially when they are made the Offerings of Respect, Esteem, and Gra∣titude. It would be too great an Honour to me, to tell the World with what readiness you have appeared to Serve me at those times when I have stood most in need of your Assistance: For which I cannot better ex∣press my Gratitude, than by a silence full of Admiration: For let me say never so much,
 I should still fall short of my Duty. This Piece is properly Yours, it being under Your Umbrage that I have been enabled to Write it. And if, out of Your wonted Genero∣sity, You shall be pleased to cast a favourable Aspect upon it, it will afford the greatest satisfaction to him, who is,
Great Sir,
