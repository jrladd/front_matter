ALL lest Good; That but onely aymes at Great,
I know (best Earle) may boldly make retreat
To your Retreat, from this Worlds open Ill.
Of Goodnesse therefore, The Prime part (the Will)
Enflam'd my Pow'rs, to celebrate as farre
As their force reacht, This Thunderbolt of Warre.
His wisht Good, and the true Note of his Worth,
(Yet neuer, to his full Desert, set forth)
Being Root, and Top, to this his Plant of Fame.
Which cannot furnish with an Ana∣gram
Of iust Offence, any Desire to wrest
All the free Letters here; by such a Test
To any Blame: for equall Heauen auert,
It should returne Reproach, to prayse Desert;
How haplesse, and peruerse, soeuer bee
The Enuies, and Infortunes following Mee:
Whose true, and simple-onely-ayme at Merit,
Makes your acceptiue, and still-bettering Spirit
My Wane view, as at Full still; and sustaine
A Life, that other subtler Lords dis∣daine:
Being Suttlers more, to Braggart-writ∣ten Men,
(Though still deceiu'd) then any truest Pen.
Yet Hee's as wise, that to Impostors giues,
As Children, that hang Counters on their sleeues:
Or (to pare all his Wisedome to the Quick)
That, for th'Elixar, hugges the Dust of Brick.
Goe then your owne Way still; and God with you
Will goe, till his state all your steppes auow.
The World still in such impious Error strayes,
That all wayes fearefull are, but Pious wayes.
