SIR,
THe Psalmes of David have been continued in verse through many Languages; in these your Majesty's Royal Father, (a Person of like Dignity, Sufferings and Piety,) breaths forth, (for so he calls them) the comforts of David. The Parallel gave occasion to this attempt; and that inaccessible perâˆ£fection of Language, in which they were first cloath'd, will justifie to the World, that there could not be any possible encouragement to this undertaking, more than that of a pious Duty to the sacred memory of the Author; and a particular Devotion to declare my self,
SIR,
