To His Highnesse the Lord Protector OF England, Scotland, andIreland.
MAy it please your High∣nesse once more to vouch∣safe to reflect a favour∣able Construction upon these poor and illiterate Lines, wherein I humbly crave Your Highnesse pardon for my ambition in presenting them to so great a Personage, they being so mean, and my self so un∣worthy:
But in confidence of Your Highnesse Clemencie, and wonted Fa∣vour towards others in the like nature, and also the Loyalty and Duty which I owe unto Your Highnesse doth engage me to do this, and more if I could; In the mean time, I am, and will ever re∣main,
MY LORD,
