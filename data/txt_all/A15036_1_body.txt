GOD with S. George, Allon, braue Gentlemen,
Set Speares in rest, renew your auncient fame:
Rush on the Pikes, the Cannon do not shen,
Your Ancestors, with passage through the same,
This Prouerbe raisde, among the French, their Foes,
Vous es fi fier, que vn Anglois.


The art as fierce, as is an Englishman,
The French still say, and proofe the same did teach:
Turne you the french into Castillian,
it hath a grace in such a loftie speach:
Your cause is good, and Englishmen you are,
Your foes be men, euen as the french men weare.


The force of death, that raiseth many feares,
In crauin harts, which courage doe dispise:
Long liues the man, that dyes in lusty yeares,
In actions where honour may arise.
And wherein may you honour more expect,
Then wronged men, to succour and protect.



The Lyon prayes, vpon the stoutest beast,
yet lickes the sheep, the which the wolfe hath wouÌ„d:
So worthy mindes, proude lookes, that feareth least,
doth helpe to raise, the wounded from the ground.
Like Lyons then, the Armes of England shield,
Pray on your foes, and pittie those that yeld.


I say no more, but God be your good speede,
And send you (hap) which I did neuer taste:
And if this Booke, you do witsafe to reade,
You cannot thinke, your labour spent in waste,
VVhich doth containe, the Morall rules of those,
That followed Mars, in thickest preace of foes.
