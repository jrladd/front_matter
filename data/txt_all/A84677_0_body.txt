Kind Sir,
I Am perswaded that you are very sencible that we are fallen into as sad and as bad times as hath be∣fallen this Nation, since and long before we were acquainted with it; and indeed, let us ballance the effect but by the cause, and here's no cause of wonder∣ment at all: We have often grieved and sad∣ned the good Spirit of the Lord, & now the Lords Spirit is about to saden us; wee have most unkindly lain his honour in the dust, & now he is about to throw us into the grave; we have bin disobedient to the golden Scep∣ter of Christ, and now he may justly breake us in peeces with a rod of Iron. Yet howe∣ver the changes and revolutions of the times may prove, it will goe well, very well with them that fear the Lord, of which number, I doe confidently beleeve that you are one;
 witnesse your Christian carriage amidst the sad miscarriages of very many men of our Profession since the wars began; and though you have lain open to as many, if not more, temptations then any of us all, considering the very many Messages that you have bin imployed in, and how you have bin earnestly solicited both by the adverse party abroad, and importuned by your loving friends at home; and yet the candid love and recipro∣cal affection you alwaies had to temperance and sobriety, by assistance from on high, you have very safely waded through them all. I must confesse 'tis a great honour to you, that you have bin Trumpet to three most famous and renowned Generalls. viz. To the Right Honourable Robert Earl of Essex, to the right Honourable Thomas Lord Fairfax, and to the Right Honourable the Lord Gen: Cromwell; but to be servant to the most high and ever-living God, is an honor for you in a superla∣tive degree Indeed. Ile say no more for fear I may bee thought to flatter you, onely in∣treat your love to patronize and shrow'd a sheet or two under your kind protection; in doing which, you will very much oblige me to remaine,
Sir,
