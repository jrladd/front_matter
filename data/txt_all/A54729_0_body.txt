Sir,
BEing very sensible of the many Fa∣vours which you have a long time been pleased to afford me, I dare no longer delay to acknowledge my Ob∣ligation: Although with the Addition of your farther trouble, in desiring your Perusal and Allowance of this Translation, wherein if you shall think that I have done the Author no lesse right then he hath done the Subject, I shall not doubt of the approbation of all o∣ther Ingenious persons; and that our Artists having such Examples will make it as much esteemed here as abroad; and it is only for their service that I have undertaken this work. I confesse I ought to present you something suitable to those higher Studies wherein you have with so much successe ex∣ercised your self, and not by any thing inferi∣our,
divert you from the Philosophical and Sublime Entertainments, which you find in that Royall Society at Gresham-Colledge, whereof you are a Worthy Member. But this being intended for an assistance to our Ingenious Workmen, and Improvement of English Architecture; I shall therefore hope for your Patronage, and that you will own me in this, as in all other occasions, to be,
Sir,
