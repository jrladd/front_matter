Madam,
IT is the first time that ever I adventured my meditations to the Press, and it would have abundantly satisfied me, if these homely and unpolished Notions, when they had served the Funeral of my Wothy deceased Friend, had bin buried together with him, and not seen the Light, nor after they had safely passed the Tyal of the Ear, have come again under the more strict examination, and exact scrutiny of the eye. But I chose rather to expose these plaine practical Truths to the danger of a curious censure, then not satisfie the desires of your Ladi∣ship and those other worthy Friends and Relations of yours, to whom I am so much obliged, or be wanting in the due respects which I owe to the Memory of him that merited the tongue and pen of a far better Orator; he that in all his publick Transactions expressed so much Piety and Obedience to Gods Commands, so much Loyalty to his Lawful Soveraigne, so much Religious care to keep a spotless and undefiled Conscience, so much tender love and re∣spect to the welfare of his Brethren and fellow Citizens, that was so zealous to preserve the City from being stained with the indelible and everlasting in∣famy of Sacred Royal Blood, certainly he and his actions deserved to be presented to the World by some such eloquent Tongue, and accurate Pen as that of St. Basil the great, whom Erasmus calleth the Christian Demost∣henes for his rare and almost unparalleld eloquence; none but an Apelles might draw the Picture of Alexander the great, nor any carve his Statue but Lysippus, as Plutarch telleth us. It was Livies opinion that none was Ad laudan∣dum Cicero∣nem, Cicero∣ne opus est. fit to praise Clcero but another Cicero; truly he had need be a very skilful Artist that draweth the picture of this worthy Knight in his due Lineaments and Proportions; here I have given the World but a rude draught, yet such as it is I bring to your Ladiship both for Patronage and Acceptance, not doubting but that you to whom the original was so dear, will most wil∣lingly embrace the Copy; whatsoever is wanting to it in skill and work∣manship, is made up in the workmans honor and affectionate Respects to∣wards him whom it represents, and those to whom he was related; and I hope thht as the Diamond commands the Ring, and makes it more precious, so this homely piece shall finde the better acceptation both with your self and others, forkis sake that is the Subject of it, who was a precious jewel indeed. Some perhaps will accuse me of Hyperbolizing, and say I have gi∣ven him too much, and some it may be wlll think I have erred in the defect,
 and say I have given him too little, but I have labored to steer my course in a middle and equal way between both these Rocks, and have as near as I could judge, given him what was his just due and no more, & what I need not want witnesses to attest; and I could do no less, for my Text teacheth me to deal Righ∣teously, which I had not done if through a fearful or hashful silence, I had con∣cealed that from the world, which was so real in him, and so profitable to be communicated to others; Here I have given a true Character out of the sacred Oracles of God, both of the wicked whom he hates, and of the righteous whom he loveth: I have shewed the fatal disappointment of the one, and the certain and blessed Reward of the other, and have set forth the work of Gods Free Grace (for I desire to set the Crown upon no other head but that) in making this worthy Knight an eminent example of the latter: Now if ei∣ther the Preaching or Printing of these few Meditations, or the laudable practice of him that occasioned them, hath or shall effectually stir up any to eschew the deceitful Way of wickedness, and walk in the safe and plain paths of Righteousness, to be obedient to God, Loyal to their Soveraigne, and faithful to their trust which God and man committed to them, and not to be overswayed by the tentations either of hope or fear to adventure upon any unrighteous and unwarantable action or design, I shall bless God for such a Mercy, and esteem it an auspicious hour that brought them forth in∣to publick view. And now neither to detain your Ladiship, nor the Rea∣der any longer in the Porch, but to bring you into the house it self, I shall adde only this humble request, that you would not be over indulgent to pen∣sive discontented thoughts that it hath pleased God to take so dear as Hus∣band from you; but rather let it be your comfort and joy that God was plea∣sed to honor you with a Husband who was so fit to be taken from you to the enjoyment of himself; consider what good God hath done by him, and now what good God hath done for him, and let these be Lenitives to asswage your grief; if God was so good as to make him righteous, and now so merciful as to make him glorious, you have greater cause of thankfulness, then sadness; if it were possible for you now to see the happiness which you have good rea∣son to beleeve he enjoyeth in the blessed vision of God, it would turn all dis∣contents into Hallelujahs and Songs of Thanksgiving. Rflect not then so much upon your own loss as upon his gain, and admire the wonderfull love of God, who hath takin away a mortal husband from you, one that you knew must die, and hath given himself to be your husband who is immortal and liveth for ever; he hath no reason to complaine that loseth the comfort of a Creature, and keeps sure possession of God the Creator; he can want no comfort that wants not God; what hath not he that hath God Quid non ha∣bet, qui habet habentem om∣nia. who hath all things? The Lord of his infinite goodness make up this earthly loss to your Ladiship, with abundance both of Spiritual and Temporal Bles∣sings upon all the living branches of that dead root, but especially with a more full enjoyment of himself and his Son Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of comfort both in the communications of Grace here and the fruition of Glory hereafter. So prayeth
Novemb. 15. 1661.
