HAil Sacrd Mother! O do not Refuse
These the First Fruits of my Converted Muse
A Muse, which in vain paths too long has trod
And now do's Consecrate her self to God.
This Change O Muse Most happy is for thee
Mount Sion now shall thy Parnassus bee
Thou never yet Could'st Sore to such a height
As that, from whence thou now begin'st thy flight
The Spires of Airy Verse climb not so high
As to the Fet of Sacred Poetry.


Mother Vouchsafe, My Influence to be
Now I thy Prodigall Return to Thee
