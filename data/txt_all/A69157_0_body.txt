RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
HAving collected the dispersed, and long neglected Papers, of this subsequent Poësie, the Posthumes of a worthie Penne, for preserving them from pe∣rishing, for the Perfections of the De∣parted, maker of immortall memorie; who was one of the Faythfull, affectionate, (and re-affe∣cted) Favourers of the honourable House of BAMFE, wherevnto Your selfe, and Yours, by a faythfull Affection, and affectionate Affinitie, are vnseparably tied. And also, Sir, for the singular and ever bound duetie, wherevnto by many Obliedgements; and vnspeakable Respects, I ever ac∣knowledge my selfe to be vnterminably tied, to loue, serue, and honour, You and Yours, and to doe all that my possibi∣litie can performe, to the eternitie of Your Name, House, and Honour. Herefore, Sir, I haue taken the boldnes, after the Author's expiring, to publish, and present, his Papers to Your Honours Hands, to passe vnder the Patrocinie and Protection of Your honourable Name. Receiue, therefore, Sir, this fatherles Orphane, vnder the Shield and Shadow of Your powerfull protection, & courteous acceptation: and

as hee presenteth to Your view a wandring Pilgrime, and a retired Heremite, both Despisers of the fleeting Plea∣sures, and flitting Ritches of this wretched World, wher∣vpon most wretchedly so many doe doate: So, Sir, let the same call vs to mynd, what we are here, and what we should ayme to bee heereafter; that as wee are Pilgrimes on earth, wee may bee Citizens in Heaven; this being our way, but Aboue, our natiue Countrey; here our travell, there our rest; heere our race, there our prize; heere our fight, there our triumph; here our seed-time, there our harvest; and as wan∣dring Pilgrimis here our Innes only, from whence we must remoue, but there our home, and mansion place, wherein we must remayne. In this estate then, Sir, let worldly things be but our Viaticum, which we should vse, as if we vsed them not: and let vs neyther be cloyed with their loue, nor clog∣ged with their cares; but seeke those things that are aboue, & to temper the edge of our eager distractions, about many thinges with Martha, let vs with Marie consider that one thing which is necessarie; and requite, in some measure, that loue which CHRIST IESVS hath carried and kythed to∣wards vs; not as this poore Heremite was with disdayne of her whom hee affected, but with mutuall tender affection, and a Christian care to keepe His Commandements; where∣by we shall gayne to our selues, more than the greatest Con∣querours, or busiest Worldlings, could ever acquire; even a glorious Kingdome, and a Crowne incorruptible. To the advancement whereof, Sir, both of you and yours, after manie and happie dayes heere, as my earnest Petition to GOD shall bee; so in all other thinges I haue vowed to re∣mayne
