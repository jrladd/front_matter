SIR,
I Transmit you here the French Copy which you were pleased to consign to me, and with it the best effects of your injunction that my weak Talent was able to reach to; but with a Zeal so much the more propense, as I judged the publication might concern the World of those mi∣serably-abus'd Persons who resign themselves to the conduct of these

bold Impostors, and who may in∣deed be said to be what the Athe∣nians mistook S. Paul for,17 Act. 18. , Setters forth of strange Gods, as well as of strange and unheard-of Do∣ctrines, whilst they take upon them thus to attribute as much to Dominus Deus Papa,Gloss. in Ex∣tr. Jo. c. 22. Cum inter de verborum signif. their Lord God the Pope, as to God Almighty himself. I stand amaz'd that a Church which pretends so much to Puritie, and that is so fu∣rious against the least dissenters to her Novelties amongst Prote∣stants, should suffer such swarms of impure Insects amongst them∣selves;

lest these Cancerous Mem∣bers (in stead of edifying the Church, and conducting Con∣sciences) eat out, in fine, the very heart and vitals of the common Christianity. For my part,Exetasis, si∣ve Tho. Al∣bii Purgati. after I have seen what Mr. White has lately publish'd concerning the Me∣thod of the Roman Court in her Decrees, and of her rare abi∣lities to discern, as he there affords us the Prospect; I have no great reason to hope for any redress of these Enormities: and then to what a mon∣strous growth this Head is like to arrive, let all the World compute, by the strange pretences of these auda∣cious

Sycophants. Nor let any man wonder how those other Errours are crept into their Religion, who in a day of so universal light permit such pernicious Doctrines to be publickly asserted, to the dishonour of our B. Lord, the scandal of his beloved Spouse, and the hinderance of that glorious Unity, which none does more earnestly breath after then He who subscribes himself,
SIR,
 21 Sept. 1664.
