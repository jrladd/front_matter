BEYNGE so ma∣ny wayes bounde vnto your lorde∣shyp, for the most gracious, bountie and munifycence, which in the tyme of my greuous calamitie you haue vnto me extē∣ded. I thought it shulde be noted in me a poynt of muche ingrati∣tude, to be so longe absent from my countrey without hauynge to

you therfore due officious thākes. wherfore I haue deuised to presēt your honour with this my poore lucubraciō. That ye same maye be an exāple of my assiduous study, and desyre to accomplysh the due∣tye, wherewith your lordeshyppe haue me so often boūde. The mat ter may be aswell conferred to the feruent affection, whiche alwayes I haue borne to my countrey, and to the grefe of my propre exyle, as also wholy attribued to the moste godly purpose of our moost drad soueraygne lorde the kynges ma∣iestie, in settynge forth his loyall subiectes▪ against our enemies.
In the one respecte I take it to be a gyfte nedefull for me to gyue.
And in the other (for this present tyme) somewhat apt for your wise dome to receyue. That the same beinge perused, corrected, and set

forth by your honour maye haue creadite with al men, the more ver¦tuouslye to do their most bounden deutie, euen in fyghtynge for their contrey, as the sapient Cato doth counsell. In my most humble ma∣ner besechynge your honourable lordeshyppe to note therein not my temerious audacite and rude∣nes, but my wyllynge harte to do my duetie for my parte & to swade other, in yt I may to do the lyke. I haue constrayned this litle worke to more brefnes then I ought, le∣uyng out the examples and histo∣ryes, wherof your lordeshyppe is so well fulcome, that I feared the readinge of them shulde be to you somewhat tedyous: notwithstan∣dynge I knowe ryght well the re∣hearsall of them shulde adde to my worke no lyttle coulloure of perswasyon: whych thyng I efte∣sones

beseche youre wysedome to accepte accordynglye, bese∣chynge almyghty god to sende you most hartely well to fare.
