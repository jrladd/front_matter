My Lord.
'TIs usual with some when they publish any of their works, to pretend they were forced to it by the importunity of Friends, which is often true, and sometimes it is al∣lowable; but 'tis no great modesty to boast of it upon every occasion. Others do prefix to their Books, to give them credit, the name of some considerable person; this is well done, if the worth of the Piece be any wayes suitable to the qua∣lifications

of that Person; else (to speak in Solomons words) it will be as a Jewel of Gold in a Swines snout.
I hope, My Lord, I have at pre∣sent in some measure hit upon that necessary proportion; Your Lord∣ship is in every account one of the most Eminent Noblemen of the Kingdome, and my Subject (though I handle it with several defects and imperfections) is of potent Princes and Republicks, a hard task in∣deed it is; for when a private man is to speak of the persons and acti∣ons of Kings and Princes, specially of so many as I have occasion to mention, he walks upon the edge of Rocks and Precipices; for of one side Princes are jealous of their Au∣thority, and the people of their Li∣berty; on the other, if he gives Monarchies such Commendations as that manner of Government de∣serves,

he must be careful to say no∣thing to the disparagement of Re∣publicks: Every one of these Go∣vernments is good in it's kind, yet not in every Countrey, only as it sutes the temper and constitution of the people; but I cannot forbear to say, that Monarchy hath of all Governments most conformity to the pattern of all, or to the Em∣pire which God hath over the World.
'Tis not an easie matter to speak of a subject which hath been treated of by several others, however there are different wayes to do it, and new observations may produce new Noti∣ons. Sometimes one hath occasion to tell his opinion of things, and herein he is himself liable to the censure of thousands of different judgement and affections; but as these things are unavoidable to those who ap∣pear in publick; so they ought to

be resolved to undergo any thing of that kind: the approbation of such persons as your Lordship, is that which writers should mind most of all, and use their utmost care to ob∣tain. 'Tis a known truth, and I declare it, My Lord, that your Na∣tural parts, joyned to the experience you have gained by your travels, have fitted your Lordship to pass a judicious Sentence upon any thing that deserves it.
I say nothing in this Relation, but what your Lordship hath more ac∣curately by far, & more exactly obser∣ved: You have been, My Lord, upon the places highly esteemed by some Princes who knew your worth and quality, and where to my own know∣ledge (if I may so say) you omitted nothing that might conduce to the improvement of your self, as a per∣son who by vertue of your Birth, Parts and Merits, will find no im∣ployment

in your Countrey too high for you, when some occasion shall be offered for your Prince to do you that favour and justice; to the end, the Nation may have some benefit of that treasure of wisdome and Experience which is in you; and I in particular the satisfaction to see your Lordship as great as you deserve; which is the earnest desire of
My Lord,
