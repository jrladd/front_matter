Madam,
YOUR Careful Education in the Primitive and Pure Reli∣gion of the Church of England hath given a Lasting Honour to his MA∣JESTY,
 a general Satisfaction to the Nation, and will bring not only many Present Comforts, but Eter∣nal Blessings to Your Self hereafter. And on this Account I did with great Thankfulness to God, and with much Pleasure receive from Your own Mouth the Notice that my Larger Books on the COMMON-PRAYER had been Serviceable to your Most Excellent Sister the Princess of Orange and Your Self. It is my Duty to serve the Meanest, but a Part of my Reward to be Useful to Persons of so High Birth and Admirable Quali∣ties, whose Example hath given so great Encouragement and Reputa∣tion to True Devotion; this is, as Plutarch calls the Conversing of Phi∣losophers with Princes, To Profit ma∣ny by Teaching one. Wherefore when the Importunity of my Friends had engaged me to write these Shorter
 Discourses, for the Use of those who wanted time to consider the Larger Work; I resolved to present this Short Account to Your HIGHNESS Hands, and beg leave to Honour it with your Most Grateful Name, supposing its Brevity may better suit the Present Circumstances of Your Married Condition, wherein it is not to be hoped that You can have so much Happy Leisure for Your Devo∣tion, as in the Eminent Piety of Your Virgin State. And because Your Goodness hath Entituled me to the Honour, but my Distance permits me not to Perform the Duty of Your HIGHNESS Chaplain, I hope these Papers may Compensate for my Ab∣sence, and serve to Revive the Me∣mory of what You have Formerly Read more at Large, and also to Con∣tinue and Encrease Your Affection to this Excellent Church which hath
 so carefully provided such Incompa∣rable Helps in Order to the Salvation of all within the Bosom thereof: Wherein that God may long preserve Your HIGHNESS to be an Orna∣ment to it, and make You a Happy Encreaser of that Royal Family who have been the Great Supporters of it, is the Hearty Prayer of all Good Subjects, and the Daily Petition of
Madam,

York April 23. 1684.
