SIR,
THIS is the Greatest Thing that I can do, for the Excellent Musick, Poetry, and Piety of these Papers; it has been my Care indeed to save them from Oblivion, but they are Indebted to me now much more, for the Defence and Ornament of Your Name.
In Addresses of this kind, Men are usually so far from suiting the Subject of their Treatises to the Qualifications of the Persons they Apply to, that we may shortly expect to see Musick Dedicated to the Deaf, as well as Poetry to Aldermen, and Prayer-Books to Atheists; and though generally it is a difficult matter to find a Worthy Patron for any One of these Excellencies, yet we happily find them all lodg'd in your self. It has indeed been very seldom known since the Royal Prophet's Time, that any Single Man has been thus Qualified, but they All meet so Eminently in You, (not to mention those other Great Advantages, which distinguish You from the rest of the World,) that had it been possible for me to have been at a Loss to whom I should have Addressed my self, Thousands would have named You in the same Instant.
To make this Collection Compleat, and that it might consist of some of the best Foreign Hands as well as our own, I have at the End inserted some of Gratiano's and Carissime's Compositions, which you, with the rest of the just Judges of Musick, so much Esteem.
Pardon me then, Sir, if I presume to beg Your Protection for these Papers, 'tis the utmost of my Fidelity and Love to my Charge; and I shall now have the Glory of Providing Better for other Men's Works, than ever the Fondest Author could do for His Own. I am,
SIR,
