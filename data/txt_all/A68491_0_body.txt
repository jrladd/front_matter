I Iudge wor∣shipful sir, that you wil won∣der how I a strainger, pre∣sume to write this little dia∣logue to your Worship: Nay rather you will mar∣uell, how also I write in the Englishe tongue. But to make plaine these cau∣ses, fyrst I say, although I dwell so far from your natiue soyle, yet by traue∣lers I haue heard of your parentage & vertuous minde touching the publike weale of your Country, and this is the cause wherefore I offer this Pilgrimes talke vnto your Worship, and where I write in your owne language, you

shal vnderstand, that I proceede out of a noble house and linage, where my deare and louing parents, wished: yea and also procured that I mought haue vnderstanding in forreyn languages, among the which I chiefely desired to speake and write the English tongue. wherefore I craue of your worship, to receyue this Pamphlet, and to pardon my base stile in your language, consi∣dering I am a strainger, and so doo∣ing, my desire shalbe fully satis∣fied, and God graunt your gentle harts desire.
