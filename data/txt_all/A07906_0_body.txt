GEntlemen, 
the trust by you re∣posed
in me, I hope you finde
to be faithfully performed on
my behalfe, in the despight of
enuy, and calumnious imputa∣tions.
What the whole scope of the deuises aymed
at, and were ordered according to your direc∣tion:
are briefly set downe in this Booke, which
I dedicate the rather to your Worships, be∣cause
yours being the charge; what honour re∣mayneth
(next to his, for whom you intended
the solemne daies Triumph) ought in reason to
returne to you. And so (in discharge of mine
owne duty) I commend both my selfe and ser∣uice
to your fauourable acceptation.
