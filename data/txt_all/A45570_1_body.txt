IT is an experienced truth, that the Devill is Gods Ape, and the dissembler a Mimick Saint; whatever graces Gods children have in substance, Hypocrites (the Devils first borne) have in semblance. Thus super∣stition putteth on the shew of devotion, faction of Zeale, and subtilty of wisdome. But as the dulnesse of Com∣mon glasse is conspicuous, when set by the transparent Christall, and a Bristol stone, when compared with the sparkling Diamond, loseth its lustre, so these mock ver∣tues are found too light, when weighed with solid graces in the ballance of the Sanctuary: For this reason it is, that I have annexed this ensuing to the precedent dis∣course, that earthly and heavenly wisdome, being set together, it may the better appeare how great a distance and dissonancy there is between them, notwithstanding their seeming allyance.
And now (Worthy Sir) not either to put my selfe out of debt to you, which cannot be without an adaequate retali∣ation, and much lesse to put you in debt to me, which cannot

be, without a worke of supererogation, but to make a pub∣lick acknowledgement, how greatly I am indebted to your goodnesse, is the designe of this Dedication.
Indeed were I to write of you, and not to you, I should (as justly, I might) exspatiate in the character of your worth; But, on the one hand, those choyce abilities where∣with God, Nature, Education and Industry, have fur∣nished you for the discharge of your Vocation, Those mo∣rall excellencies of Prudence, Temperance, Humility, Affability and Charity, which adorne your conversation, are such, as envy cannot blast, nor need I to blazon. And on the other hand, as I abhor to speak what is evill (especially if false) of another behinde his back, so I would be sparing to mention what is good (although true) of another to his face; since as that incurreth the guilt of detraction, so this the suspicion of flattery.
Onely (to avoid the odious blot of ingratitude) I cannot, I must not bury your many favours in the grave of silence, having so fit an opportunity to publish them. Indeed that amicable society as a neighbour, cordiall fidelity as a friend, gratuitous care as a Physitian, and bounteous love as a Parishioner, which you have expressed to me, are singly, much more joyntly strong obligations: for all which, Accept (good Sir) my hearty thanks, together with my earnest prayers, that God would crown your skill with successe, your estate with prosperity, your life with old age, your minde with tranquility, your soul with his grace, and that grace with glory.
