Honoured Sir,
GReat and many are the Obligations (since Providence so order'd it) that moved me to request your Patronage of these Poems, as I might thus variously instance. First, in that Nature so far befriended my Birth, as to be a Native, both of your Neighbourhood, and County; Likewise upon
that acquaintance, (and if I may so far presume, I might stile if the intintate acquaintance) that I had with your Honour in the days of Infancy, and Minority of my Age; the renovation of which ac∣quaintance in my Maturity or riper Years impos'd an Obligation upon me to Reverence, and Regard your Honourable Person, especially when I had In∣telligence of your late approach to London, and the Honour of your Courteous Visit at my Habitation, before I had Information of your Abode; besides these Obligations, I have a regard to some others in a more peculiar manner; namely those Virtuous Quali∣fications which manifested, and still do manifest themselves in the whole course of your Sober Con∣versation, (to wit) Meekness and Familiarity: with these foremention'd motives; More I might still nominate, as touching your Candid Deportment towards my Parentage, and that Affection and Amity my Father continually enjoy'd from the Bounty of your Noble Progeny; all which were main Inducements, provoking my Ambition to shelter my slender Conceptions under the Ornament of your Patronage; and to further my attainment in this attempt, I observed the Caution of the wise man in Pro. 27. v. 10. Thine own Friend and thy Fathers Friend forsake not, or as I might fitly add, forget not; and to Reverence your Noble Name, to whom I am a Debtor in respect of Ser∣vice, Affection and Gratitude, I conjectur'd it
expedient to be the Memorial of this Dedication, by reason the first Fruits of my Intellectual Pro∣ductions, flowing from a Divine Instinct, both in this; and the ensuing method: I must needs acknowledge it to be my great Encouragement and Satisfaction, in that I am Honoured with so worthy a Patron as your Generous and Ingenious self, whose Virtue, Candor, and Affability, doubles your Honour, while others exalted to a higher degree, by Pride maculate their Promotion. May your Honour, as you are my Patron, be pleased to per∣use these ensuing Poems, and may these Poems, be worthy your perusal: The best Apology J can make in mine or their defence, is only this: That there are variety of Inferences, drawn from variety of Subjects, comprehended in this little Volume; some whereof may be smoother polished than others, and thereby the more approveable: In case that if any be found knotty and unevan, I hope they may be the more dispensible, if observ'd as deriving from a Novice in the Potent Science of Poetry.
I am dubious that your Discerning eye may find Imperfections in their Perusual. But I had rather lisp and stammer forth the Praises of my God, than be bruitishly silent; yet must acknowledge the Theme deserved an abler Poet, and I fear may in some places seem Maculated by my ruder Pen: Wherefore I am Importunate in the Imploration of your Candor, to Connive at my Misdemeanours in
all respects, and vouchsafe my Pardon from your Cle∣mency for the presumption of this Address, and those Expressions that stand in need either of Gravity or Gratitude in reference to your Parts and Person: Thus Craving your Honour to accept of my Will for the Deed; the which shall impose up∣on my self a further Obligation, entituling me to remain acccording to the stile of this my sincere Subscription,
SIR,
