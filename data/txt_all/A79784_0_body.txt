Madam,
IT often happens in Books what somtime in Children, that although obscurely born, they are by the benigne aspect of some great Person hap∣pily cast upon them, entertained and bred up in princely palla∣ces, and flourish as much by hap∣py chance, as they could have don by a greater birth. I wish with all my heart that this little Off-spring of mine, which coms running with a modest confi∣dence to the feet of your glori∣ous
Vertues, which have only moved it to such a boldnes, may find favour in your eyes: so that incouraged by the greatness of your Name, it may chearfully go in and out conspicuous in the world, and do the good my heart desireth. To the end it may bear with it some possibi∣lity of acceptance both, Ma∣dam, with your Honour and with the world too, I have to my power imprinted upon its forehead the general lineaments of noblenes, Reason and Civil∣lity. But other Ornaments are so far wanting, that it may not expect entertainment, but where som great part of that Goodnes which hath rendred the Countess
of Arundel so renowned and gracious may inhabite.
The Book carries no other intent but what a Person of Honour may own: and its pur∣pos written upon its face an∣swers directly to its heart and spirit. It would for sooth pacifie our rurall distempers about af∣fairs of Religion, and showes a Light that Madnes may see what it does, where it mistakes, and how irrationally it rages. This is the very end and pur∣pos of my Book, laudable e∣nough I may presume, and not unworthy the Countenance of Honour, were it accomplished with that art so good a purpos requireth. Let your own excel∣ling
goodness, Madam, cover the other defects; and gracious∣ly accept what I humbly offer, a sincere though not very pro∣found, not a high and eloquent, but which is harder in the rude distempers I am to deal withall, a peaceable, harmles, well-mean∣ing Book. In my dark obscurity I dye daily; but my ashes will joy, If it should haply fall out, that good be wrought in England unto the promoting of sobernes in any one, by the Countess of Arundels FIAT LƲX: and so will those with me, who may chance to receiv any satisfaction from this little Light, be bound to your Ladi∣ship, whose countenance and
favourable assistance has been the instrument of setting it forth, wherein you shall ever oblige me to be,
Madam,
