SIR.
IF I am bold, it is in fulfil∣ling
your desires: I am
confident you well re∣member
when we were Pri∣soners
together, that your
self gave me the several sub∣jects
of these short Medita∣tions;
I confess I have no

cause to blush at the sub∣jects,
but I fear you will find
cause to blush at the bad
performance of your de∣sires;
however, I have done
my endeavor; and if you
please to own it worth your
acceptance, I shall own your
acceptance worth my labor,
and ever remain
