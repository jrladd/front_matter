Madam,
YOur illustri∣ous Name is traced on the Frontis-piece of
this Book, as that of Minerva in the Temple of Ver∣tue; To render the names of these Famous Vestals, more recommen∣dable by that of so great and illustri∣ous a Princesse as your Highness is: whose marvellous wisdom, and pro∣found knowledge
in Arts, Sciences, and Languages, is admired by all men; whose great Iudgement, and Goodness, are in∣expressible symp∣toms of excelling Qualities.
Let therefore your memory, most Sacred and Famous Princess, be as eternal, as
your illustrious life happy and succesfull! May your future for∣tunes be answer∣able to your ver∣tues! that as you have the daily earnest prayers of all good men, so you may have the successe of their wishes; the which though many who
never yet saw you desire, yet all those who have had the honour to be ac∣quainted wth you, know how worth∣ily You deserve them: For that your vertues have raised you to such a high degree of perfection, as that you render not only those of your
but even all Men unable to imitate Your Highnesse: They, as well as my self, are there∣fore solely obliged to admire You: which is the only intent of
Madame,
