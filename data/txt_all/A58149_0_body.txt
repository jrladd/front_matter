Right Honourable,
I Am no pretender to that thred-bare Apology of the importunity of friends, in the committing of this worthless nothing of mine unto the press; for had I hearkened to some, this had never come into the light, so inconsiderable is he that bears the name of my Antagonist, though, (as I am ascertain∣ed) one of greater eminency shrowds himself under my no∣minal adversaries wing, and yet hath not the confidence to appear in publique.
But whosoever it is that took up the Gantlet, since it is lear that the Holy Truths of God are by him stricken at through my sides, and that many poor deluded people are se∣duced by his plausible miscarriages; I could not do less in

justice and conscience, then to shew my self in publique, both for the vindication of the cause of God, that it may not suf∣fer by my silence, and that I may in some measure undeceive the light-headed, tottering and unstable people. Tis very true, I was decoy'd into this ingagement, there being onely at first desired of me to write down my resolves unto certain Positi∣ons, for the private satisfaction of some staggering persons; which being rudely because suddenly conceived and drawn up, not having time to clothe that Embryon in any curious dress, my adversary by subtilty seiseth upon it, and after a twelve monthes travel brings forth rudem indigestamque molem, a mishapen answer unto (some part onely of) my re∣solves, and steals it through the Press.
Now because I was surprised in that, I held it needful to vindicate both my self and it, which howsoever in the outward accoutrements it be ragged and torn, yet for the matter of it I doubt not but that it hath truth to support it.
But yet alas! who am I that I should adventure to under∣take this task, being less then the least of all the Saints, and especially seeing the subject matter thereof is of so great con∣cernment? The well is deep, and my fathoming is but shallow, I must confess I am so low a man in the esteem of the world, and so obscure every way, that I fear the truth may sustain some loss through my weakness; my onely hopes are that that God who begun that good work in and by me to the satisfaction of a few, will now perfect that work which he hath begun to the re∣solving of others.
And whereas custome hath so far prevailed for the dedica∣tion of Books to some noble Personages, my next hopes are that your Lordship will be graciously pleased to honour me your unworthy servant so far as that I may shelter my self under your Honours Patronage. And I do the rather take hold of this occasion upon this ensuing consideration.
Right Honourable, Twice have I had a large experience of your goodness and bounty in the setling of me in the Par∣sonage

of Hasilbury Bryan, first in recommending me to the Committee of the County upon the delinquency of the incum∣bent, and afterwards upon his death by the free granting of me your Lordships Presentation thereunto, notwithstanding the interposition of some to the contrary; hereby freeing me from many of those snares, wherein many of our coat are (in these corrupt times) very much intangled: and hitherto I had no opportunity to give any evidence of that thankful∣ness I owe unto your Lordship. I know it were injustice in me to smother it, for, si ingratum dixeris omnia dixeris. Neither could I so satisfie my self, in bare expressions, and that in a private manner, to testifie a thankful acknowledge∣ment, unless I did withal set the same upon record; hat as this poor tract of mine passeth abroad in the world, it may stand up every where as a publique testimony of my private obli∣gations unto your Honour. And however I am confident you take no pleasure to have your goodness published, but that you are rather satisfied with the peace of a good conscience then with the gawdy outside of specious Encomiums, yet it be∣comes an ingenuous spirit to profess how and by what hand mercies are reach't forth unto him. God make me truly thank∣ful to him for his good providence over me herein, and for all other his mercies towards me.
And I could heartily wish, that all the world might under∣stand your noble disposition and Christian conversation in the midst of your worthy family, how you make your self a pattern unto them in godliness and honesty, both in publique and pri∣vate, that so every man might be provoked by your gracious example, and therein as in a glass behold how immeasurablely you exceed the painted sepulchres of this our age, both in re∣ference to God, in giving him the honour due unto his great name; as also in reference to man, by a distributive justice rendring to those who have a dependency on your Lordship according to their deserts.
But I must withdraw, lest that in setting forth your praises I de∣rogate from your worth, which deserves the pen of a ready wri∣ter

to advance it to the height. My Honoured Lord, I hope and humbly crave, that your Lordship will be pleased to accept this small and simple present, as a signal testimony of that great observance and thankfulness I owe unto your Honour, professing my self so deeply engaged, that I shall be ever studi∣ous how I may do you any faithful service in the Lord; which whiles I am wanting in any other means of manifestation, my supplication shall be at the throne of grace, to grant you length of dayes, continuance in and increase of all true honour, and comfort therein, amidst all the shakings of this present evil world; and the crown of glory in that world that is to come: which shall be the dayly prayer of,
My Honoured Lord,
 From my Study in Hasilbury Bryan.
