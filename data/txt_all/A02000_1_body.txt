RIght reverend Sir,
being of opinion, that
the subject of this
booke, intituled the
Galateo Espanol,
is of great importance, and of much
furtherance, to know how, and in
what manner, men ought (ordi∣narily)
to carry themselves, so that
they be not only not ill thought of,
and hated of others, But very ac∣ceptable,
and pleasing to all: and
considering on the other side, that
for want of Copies thereof, the
common wealth looseth this so great
a good. I determined to print it

at my owne charge. Because that it
is not now in my power, or ability,
to doe things of greater impor∣tance,
I have (at least) done what
I could in this little: and as much
as my skill would reach unto. After∣ward
taking it into my considera∣tion
unto whom I were best to
dedicate it, as the custome is to
doe, in the like impressions of
bookes; my phansy then gave me, that
I could not better dedicate it, to any
body then your honour, who with
greater zeale and thought, desireth,
& procureth, the good of this same
common wealth then any other, (as
all doe well see, & confesse) as well
in the charge of a Counsellour, as in
that of a deputy, which your ho∣nour
houlds, at the present, and doth
order, and governe there in with
so great diligence. Therefore I trust,
that your honour will bee pleased,
to receive it under your protection:
and although the service bee not
such, as is fit for the person of your

Honour, yet receive the heart and
good will, with which it is offe∣red,
together with the desire I
have, to serve your Honour, and the
common wealth, (dayly) more and
more, in matters of greater conse∣quence:
for by this favour, and
reward, I recover more heart, and
vigour, to undertake, and finish
a greater worke. God keepe your
Lordship.
Right illustrious Sir,
