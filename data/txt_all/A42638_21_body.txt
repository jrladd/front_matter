POssibly there are not wanting such who accustomed themselves to carp at all things not directly of their humour, that will (upon sight of the Title of this ensuing discourse) think it strange, that I should in an Epistle to you, treat on the case of the perishing Buildings of mor∣tals, though you already have been enter∣tained with observations made on the bills of mortality; as also the Vegitation of Plants, when as indeed your Apollo's O∣racle-like Arcenal, may challenge the most sublime proffers of men of parts; And that if I would follow the practise of men, who tell strange things, (having been in parts remote from this Region) I should not be∣gin with Clay, Sand and Chalk, whereof Bricks and Lime are made, and is daily digged bere at home. I should rather have set forth some accompt of Marriners, which during a year and upwards were my sole



Companions on the Ocean, or the cause of the Trade Wind, which serves us to Ame∣rica, without shifting Sails; as also whe∣ther the starry apparition which discovers it self, when North-Pole is obscured, be that which Constantine the Emperour see, whereby he made his Victorious conclusion; 2ly How my tear-man found the Ebb & Flood all along the Coast of America, contrary to the several observations and re∣lations of a number of Sea-men, who have maintained, that it was impossible for a ship that was fallen on that Coast below the Port (whereto it was bound) to get up a∣gain; except it tackt about one hundred of Leagues, to recover a Trade wind for the reaching a higher Course; having found (as I say) the contrary, after my Stears∣man had lost time to sail five hundred Leagues beyond the River of Amazons, not to fail to cast Anchor before that of Wiapoca, Aperwack, Cawo, Wia, and finally in the Bay of Cajana; when as my Stears-man found that notwithstanding the violent stream from that River of A∣mazon, he was not hindred to get up a∣gain by reason of a constant ebb and flood.
Criticks knowing also that (among



such Eminent Phylosophers (who like stars in the Firmament, do with the approbation of the great Apollo of this Monarchy, and his sacred influence, dive in matters most sublime) would fit more seasonably from me an account of a day of rejoycing made by wild people (who know no more of God, then that they are told of him to be a good man, who drinks Tobacco, and that if they do well, they shall go to him with their wives to drink with him, to the confusion of those who pay not their vows in obedi∣ence, as is most due to Soveraigns; which was manifested, when one of their Chiefs told me, that his sacred Ma esty was re∣turning to His Throne, when no living creature was come from Europe into that part of America to signifie that Newes, which was (as they said) revealed unto them by their Mackbouy; it was when His Majesty was yet at Breda; whether then this truth doth not confirm, that Spirits not clogg'd with material bodies, know things most secret.
But leaving Criticks to their unneces∣sary scruples, I have for the present pitcht on this discourse concerning Building, and thought fit not to forget to Dedicate



an Epistle to a Person of so great Honour, so great Knowledge, and particularly in that without which, a great Phylosopher of the first learned Ages would not admit any into his Accademy, to wit Geometry; a Person that understands all the Appur∣teinances to the Mechanicks, who hath a matchless knowledg of the building of that whereof the Original was made, by the di∣rection of the Supream Architect, to wit, the Arke.
And this being my dis-interessed scope, I shall re∣main confident that this Advise to all Builders, may be usefull either to your Lordship, or to some of the Royal Society, or to any of those to whom they are bound to wish well, that they may be perswaded to beware of ill Builders, who may well deserve to be comprehended in the Bill of Mortality, since by their Exorbitances, happen many irreparable acci∣dents, viz. Chimnies which falling through the roofs of Houses, kill good people in their beds; who con∣trive Rooms, Windows, and Doors, which draws upon Inhabitants ill and infectious Air, from which I shall continue to wish all men may be preserved, and profess to be,
