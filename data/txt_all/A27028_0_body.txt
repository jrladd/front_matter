Reader,
WHEN I had Written the first of
these Discourses, I came after to
know more of the Authors Judg∣ment,
by another Book against me;
which I also Answered, but it lyeth by unprinted.
I also wrote, for the use of some private Friends,
my Reasons for Communion with those Parish∣Churches
who have Capable Ministers, which many
Importuned me to Print; but that also is yet un∣done:
But a Book famed to be Mr. Raphsons
coming out, I thought it my duty to Animadvert
on that, and to bear my Testimony against Schism
on both Extreams, left I be guilty of Partiality,
and of the Sin and suffering of many that may
be deceived by them. If these Two be not over∣much
discouraged, the other Two against both the
Extreams may come hereafter.
