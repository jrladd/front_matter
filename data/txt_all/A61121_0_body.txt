Right Honourable,
I Might justly imagin my self to be thought rude and im∣pertinent, when I first presumed to tender this Account to your Honour; and I should never have adventured upon so great a Boldness, if I had not thought it re∣ally my Duty to present it to your Honours View: And the Reason which moved me to it was, because the most notable Actions herein related, as the taking of St. Christophers and St. Eustace, were the immediate Success of part of that Royal Navy, which your Honour now happily commands in Chief; I mean that Squadron commanded by Admiral Wright in the West Indies, without which it had been ut∣terly impossible for the English to have enterprized any thing in those Parts: For their Majesties Islands there were so depopulated by a raging Mortality, that the sur∣viving Inhabitants were even harrassed with a daily Fa∣tigue
to defend themselves. Ʋpon this Motive, joyn'd with the Consideration of the innate Generosity, which is ge∣nerally found in all Persons so Nobly and Honourably descended as your self; but is so peculiar to the most No∣ble Family of Bedford, and with which (as you are a Principal Branch thereof, so) you are principally adorned; I first assumed the Blodness to address you Honour with a Copy of this Relation; and the high Favour you were pleased to vouchsafe me, in your Perusal and Approbation of it, when it was a Manuscript, hath encouraged me not only to send it to the Press, but hath also emboldened me to implore your Patronage to countenance it, with which it will be sufficiently honoured and defended, and may boldly appear in Publick. But for the return of so high an Obli∣gation, as it transcends the utmost of my Hopes to accom∣plish, so I must confess my Incapacity to make any farther Advances towards it, than an humble and grateful Acknow∣ledgement, which shall ever be paid with the strictest Ob∣servance, by him who craves leave to subscribe himself,
Right Honourable,
