MY Honourable and rightly eminent L. it is a Question whi∣ther God hath more blessed you, or the Land by you, the heauens haue bene so gracious to your Honour, and you so ready to returne Grace and Honour to the Heauens. The
Courts of Iudgment, and Chaun∣cerie of Mercie witnesse your exquisite VVisedome in the tem∣per of both, by your Lordships sitting in the one sidus beneficum, a happie Starre in the Starre Cham∣ber, in the other numen pacificum, a good Angel in the Chauncerie, and not only so, but in the Church, where your Honour hath vouch∣safed fauour to helpe many a Cler∣gie-man into Bethesdas poole, without the superstitious mediati∣on of Angels. In regard of which pious and glorious Patronage, all that are able to speake or write in the Church, bee they Scribes or Pharisees, I meane Rabbins, or Neophyts owe much respect to your Lordship. Among the rest
of the least I offer vp this my poor Morning sacrifice, which first tooke fire at the Altar of Paules Crosse, it was a Sacrifice without the Temple, yet my Prayers shall be that this be like the fire in the temple which was neuer extingui∣shed. And so with my harty deuo∣tions to the Lord for the long helth and happinesse of your Lordship, the Noble Countesse your La∣dy, and your worthy and Honourable Sonne, I rest,
