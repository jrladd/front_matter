My Lord,
THIS Poem, drawn by the loud Fame of Your Learning and Candour, comes from the re∣motest Parts of the World to fall down at your Honour's Feet; there being not one Part of the Earth or Sea, which is not fill'd with the Report of Your Goodness, and which doth not know, that Your Family is the Asy∣lum of Arts and Arms. It hath pass'd safe∣ly the Northern Snows, and Southern Fires, nor hath it been swallow'd up in the merciless Gulf. It hath been preserv'd from the Sa∣vage Monsters of the Sea, and the as-savage Indian Cannibals. It hath visited both In∣dies, and it would be too hard a Fate to have it suffer Shipwrack in the Port. It flies to You for Protection from a sort of Monsters,

Africk never bred, nor the Indies are ac∣quainted with; whom the Sea never produc'd, nor can shew in its Depths and Abysses, viz. those Momes, whose strength lies not in their Teeth, but their Tongue; who kill not for Hunger, but Malice; and whose Words are like the pois'ned Arrows of the Indians. It hath seen the greatest Rarities in the World, which it finds outdone in Your Self; and with an admiration, it never was touch'd with be∣fore, begs leave to adore those Perfections, which it is not in the power of Words to ex∣press. Which if Your Honour vouchsafe, it will be the greatest Credit and Security, that a Mortal Muse could ever deserve, or desire; and consequently an Eternal and Weighty Ob∣ligation to
(My Lord)
