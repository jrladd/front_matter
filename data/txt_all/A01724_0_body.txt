I Haue long time wi∣shed (Right Hono∣rable) that I might in some sort be able, if not to recōpence which in deed I shal neuer, yet at the least to shewe some token of a grateful minde, for all the ancient kindnes, & louing fauour, which I haue found at your hands: this hath caused mee to foreslip no occasiō, wherby I might haue som∣what to present you withall, which might tend to your soules health: for concerning the thinges which per∣taine to the body, as honours, digni∣ties

and riches, the high Lorde of Lords hath giuenyou so much, that though I woulde neuer so faine, yet I cannot benefite you in them: ha∣uing therefore of late a kinsman at home with me, who being, some∣what of a readie hande, hath taken from the mouth of our Preacher, certaine of the Sermons which hee hath preached, whiche beeing againe ouerseene and corrected, I thought it my dutie, to offer them vnto your honor, as a taste of those fruites wherewith the Lorde doth feede vs in the Countrie. Beeing a great deale the more bold to doe it, because I know they bee such as ye haue long time shewed a loue to taste of: & I trust these shal also come vnto you as ripe and timely fruites of pleasant and delightsome taste, al∣though they be set before you in no golden or siluer plate, but as it were

in a woodden platter: for the holie Apostle Saint Paule saieth, that this treasure is brought in earthen ves∣sels. I beseech your honour there∣fore to accept of my poore good will, and to take this my small gifte in good part: which nothing doub∣ting of, I pray God to multiplie his blessings and gracesvpon you, to his glorie, and your euerlasting com∣fort.
Amen.
