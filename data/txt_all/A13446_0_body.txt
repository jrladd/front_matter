KInde Sir, my loue to you's ingag'd so deepe,
That were I Idle, I were much ingratefull:
Or should my thankes, forgetfull, euer sleepe
In me, 'twere base, vnmannerly and hatefull.
Then though I cannot pay you halfe my score,
Vouchsafe to take this trifle as a part,
As time enables me you shall haue more,
And therefore now accept my willing heart.
I know, you well doe vnderstand and know
The weake defects of my defectiue Muse,
Yet doe I hope you will this fauour showe
That loue may her vnwilling faults excuse.
And so to your protection I commend
This Pamphlet, as vnto my deerest freind.
Yours in my best imployments to be commended. IOHN TAYLOR.
