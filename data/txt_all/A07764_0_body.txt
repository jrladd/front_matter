RIght Worship∣full & Reverend Sir, I am bolde to present vnto your Worsh: my most endebted service, vnder the vaile of this little booke. It is the pen, and word must serue you, not the sword: what though my quil be dull, and the glorious light of the originall of this worke bee clowded and obscured by mine
vnskilfull translation: yet abā∣don you it not vtterly, but loo∣king on the lustre of the setting sunne, that Aged Head, that be∣got this, thinke that the obscu∣rity here cannot be so Aegypti∣an-like, but that some rayes may neverthelesse haue power to shine? The Author is a true Champion of the Militant-Re∣formed-French Church, long trained vp vnder her stāderd. For having already valiantly fought both with pen & sword, he is yet ambitious in her service: either violētly to chase the old Goose out of the Capitoll: or toMist. Ini∣quit in epist. ad Regem Mag. Brita. finde a glorious tombe in the snow of the Alpes. Let him bee an Apologie for my boldnes, and a perswasion to humbly entreat your Worship to accept this small duty of mine; which if you shall be pleased so kindly to doe, as I with all humility doe offer it: you will so encourage
me, that if higher meanes bee wanting I shall further striue in this kinde hereafter to shew my selfe in all manner of service.
