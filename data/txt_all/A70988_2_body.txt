MADAM,
YOur CYRUS hath lengthened this Fourth Address beyond expe∣ctation: but 'twas because he had more to say; for He hope's to answer (as Tully did when they ask'd his opinion of Demosthenes' Orati∣ons) that the longest is the best. Were it better, 'twere fitter for your Honour's acceptance: and Nobler it had been if a great Personage of our own Nation (who never stood forth to the World in Print) had fill'd his Design in translating this Author; wherein there was good Progress made, till the whole Translation was found to be finish'd by another hand. The Author (I hear) first built this Story in contemplation of an eminent Lady of France, whose rich Idaea so heighten'd his Soul as made him write no∣thing that's mean or vulgar. Had his knowledge been bless'd with your Ladyship's Character, he had lift up his thoughts (if possible) higher. For, when he consider'd the Strength and Largeness of Your Understanding; the number, height, and perfection of Your Vertues; the admirable composure of Your Outward and Inward Form, (to say nothing of the honour of your high Extraction) and all these assisted by your own most Learned and Noble LORD, with that happy Transcript of both Your Persons in that excellent young Lady (the image and delight of all your Perfections:) When these great Materials had stood before our Authors Phansie, he had drawn his MANDANA and the Great CYRUS greater than them∣selves. But it is not for men of humble condition (that is, for me) to discourse of things so Illustrious as Your Ladiship, for whose increase in all Felicity may God accept the Prayers, and your Ladiship the Endeavours of
(MADAM)
