Right reverend in Christ,
WHen the Lord turned away the captivity of our Kingdoms, then were we like men that dreamed: The greatness of the felicity, the strangeness of the means, the insensibleness of the manner made us distrust our very
senses. When we saw the Church immediately after her return from the wildernesse, furnished with such burning and shining lights, that it is not easily decided whether the promotions or persons are most dignified: then were we like men astonished; then did we ad∣mire the goodness of God, and the force of truth which spight of so many years persecutions and tentations, preserved such multi∣tudes undeluded, & uncorrupted. When we heard that your Lord∣ship was appointed to be the An∣gel of our Western Church, then were we like men transported, then did we magnify the Wisdom of his Majesty, in committing the government of so large a diocese to a person in whom zeal & know∣ledge,
learning & wisdom, courage and moderation had mingled them∣selves into so happy a temper, as to render him one of the most eminent Patrons of the Church in her affli∣ctions, & worthy to be numbred a∣mong her most eminent pastors in her prosperity.
But our wine was cooled with wa∣ter when we heard that your Lord∣ship took too deep apprehensions of our divisions, which resentments will soon confess themselves to have abused you, when you shall find the far greatest part of the factious mew∣ing their impudence with their hopes, and forsaking the withered thistle for that tree which though it were cut down yet sprouteth again.
It is not indeed expectable, but in some greater Towns where the
wealth, and numbers of their disci∣ples shal tempt them to expect more profit, and reputation from their ob∣stinacy, there will be found some ve∣nemous spirits who will entertain his Majesties gratious condescensi∣ons as they did his blessed Fathers; that is, as fire doth fuel, not to be sa∣tisfied, but emboldened; For their observation is purblind, who per∣ceive not that the Iesuite, and Puritan agree (as in many other their worst practices so especially) in this, that ex∣cluding all others besides their own party from any title to heaven, they call a rigid inflexibleness, zeal, and Christian moderation, lukewarmnes.
But if reason do not abuse us we shall find, that when mens troubled humors shall cease from fermenta∣tion, their understandings will be∣come
so much the clearer for their past disturbances, and able to read those bloudy characters wherein the dismal effects of Schisme, are largely written by lamentable experience upon every family of this Nation; so that being thus doubly taught, not only by S. Iames, but by woful ex∣perience, they will not hereafter be so apt to kindle, if the Incendiaries should again scatter their fiery darts from those mischievous tongues, which set on fire the course of nature and are set on fire of Hell.
Towards which consideration I offered some light in this Cathedral which for some yeares suffered a Schisme in her very fabrick, by adivi∣sion in her body and preachers, and a market in her cloystures.
It was not (sure) the worthiness
but the necessity of the discourse, which moved those hearers to press me to this publication, against whose importunity, I could not harden my self without falling under that con∣demnation, which I proved to be∣long to them that strive with their superiors.
And being come so far, I was easi∣ly encouraged to make another bold step, and present it to your Lord∣ship; that the first addresse which you received in quality of our Bi∣shop, might bring you an omen of good success in your charge, an ear∣nest of the far greater services which you may promise your self from many others, equally unknown, but far more able, and an opportunity for an early proof of your goodness by pardoning this boldness of
