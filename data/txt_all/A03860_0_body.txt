Where spring is small, great streams may not be ail,
Yes as it is, doe make the owner glad,
I one me compels, a cup thereof to bring,
If honor please, to tast of this poore spring.
And dip your p, a little in the sne,
My ioy were great, though boldnesse ris blame.


Heere I present vnto your honors view,
timely fruit, as in my orchard grew,
No better choise therein that I could find,
Nor other thing that fitted to my mind,
 better yeare some better fruit may grw,
uch as shall be are yours, my selfe also.
