My Lords,
ACcidentally meeting with a certain Pamphlet concerning Courage, which was design'd (no doubt) to weaken the Hands of Gods People, or dismay their Majesties Forces in this holy War by Sea and Land; I conceived it would not be in vain for me to publish something which might tend to their Majesties Welfare, and the Encourage∣ment of the Fleet and Army in this depraved Age, wherein Fidelity is abandon'd by many as Anti∣christian. My Lords, these naked Truths in these Jejune Papers, are for the most part such as were sounded in the Ears of the Army: And therefore I have reason to hope they may be em∣brac'd by them now with the same Candidness and Singleness of Heart as they were deliver'd, in or∣der to the Advancement of Gods Glory, the good
 of the Church Militant, against the common Ene∣my and Oppressor, and the Welfare, Peace and Hap∣piness of their Majesties and their Kingdoms. I must confess, my Lords, there is in them no Po∣liteness of Style, Floridness of Phrase, or Sweetness of Rhetorick, which may make them esteem'd by the Learned: Yet I hope a familiar Scripture-dress may not be disesteem'd by the Vulgar and more Ʋnlearn'd, for whom alone they are sent abroad in this nice Age. And since nothing is spoken here but what hath been spoken before our Days, and Treatises or Sermons are generally entertain'd ac∣cording to the Proverb, Quot Homines tot Sen∣tentiae. I must crave the Honour of your Lord∣ships as to shelter these honest, tho' unpolish'd Pa∣pers, under your Lordships Patronage, praying you to accept them, as a sincere Acknowledgment of that indispensible Duty which is owing unto your Lordships,
