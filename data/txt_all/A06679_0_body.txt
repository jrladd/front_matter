ADmired Ladies, as well for your excellent ver∣tues; as your rare beau∣ties; I humbly intreate your pardons before I crave your Patronage, deeme not I beseech you, that this presumption of mine, (namely) the resem∣blance of a Poet, hath ta∣ken his originall from any defect of your Ladiships in∣genies, or want of discretion to iudge betweene the piping of Pan, and the musicke of Apollo; bettweene that which is rude, and that which is exquisite, in whom, there is no defect or want of acute and dis∣creete iudgement: But onely that it hath proceeded from the aboundance of your patiences and curteous promises, to all such as are indued with any sparke of good literature, or have a desire to attaine to know∣ledge. For my part (sweete Ladies) I alwayes affected Schollers, but every man cannot be learned, every Po∣et

cannot be Virgil. I present therefore vnto you this my Pamphlet (kinde favorites) not as the picture of Minerva, wrought by Fideas, was presented; that is, as a thing worthy to be respected, but at your vacancie and fit oportunitie to be perused. As a trifle therefore to spend the time withall, I have entituled it (My La∣dies Toy,) which I hope shall not be offensive eyther in Title or Tittle, in composing whereof, I have more aymed at the fulfilling of your pleasures, then any waies deserved popular applauses. Thus wishing to your Ladiships, the comfort of heaven, the content∣ment of heart, and the continuance of happinesse; in hope whereof, and prayer for which, I rest
