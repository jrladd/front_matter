My most Honour'd Lord and Patron,
THE great Blessings which I enjoy under the happy Influence of your Lordship's Favour, oblige me with all due Humility to lay these Discourses at your Lordship's Feet: not

as though I can be so vainly arrogant, as to imagine they any ways deserve your Perusal or Acceptance, but purely as an Acknowledgment of your Lord∣ship's Goodness, and an hearty, tho' poor, Expression of my unfeigned Gratitude. Most of them have been compil'd since your Lordship vouch∣saf'd to receive me under your Wings, and therefore it may be expected, that they approve themselves in some mea∣sure worthy of so noble a Patronage. This (I confess) I have ambitiously en∣deavour'd effectually to accomplish; But if I fall short of so Great an Enter∣prise, I humbly hope for Pardon from your Lordship's Candour, which the World has so long and so deservedly ad∣mir'd. I am,
My most Honoured Lord,
