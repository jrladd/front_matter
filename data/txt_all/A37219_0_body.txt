My Lord,
THE ensuing Treatise being sent me from a conceal'd Author, with permission to make it publick, I soon had my Opinion of it con∣firm'd by better Judgments; that as it discover'd vast labour in the Compiling, so it would prove of equal Use and Advantage to





the Reader. Hereupon I found a double Care incumbent upon me, both to secure it from Er∣rors of the Press, and procure its Recommendation to the World, by the Patronage of some Honourable Person, which the Author's Modesty has ren∣der'd more needful. Whither therefore should I betake my self for protection of this Perfor∣mance, but where  and Generosity are united; and where is this Union more illustrious than in your Lordship, who are blest with such Endowments of Art and Nature, as even adorn your Quality, and bring access of Honour to your Family, already famous for a long Race of Ance∣stors. This were a sufficient Glory, when your Lordship had arriv'd to years of perfection; but your early Genius disdains the

slower methods of Time, and makes you mature in Knowledg in the blossom of your Age. Be∣side the sweetness of Disposition and acquaintance with the Mu∣ses, your Lordship has already brought home the Improvement of Travel, to that eminent de∣gree, as must soon render you an Ornament to our Court, and Blessing to our Countrey. Illud demùm absolutum esse Ingenium quod ad Rempublicam simul{que} scientias factum sit. This, in the opinion of Barclay, is the Perfection of a Gentleman, and a Character whereof your Lordship has al∣ready given signal Instances. It must never be forgotten, how early your Lordship (like ano∣ther Scipio) was concern'd for the Publick, and (in our late Trouble) with generous Loy∣alty raised a Troop of Horse

for his Majesties and your Coun∣tries Service. This single Spe∣cimen were enough to create that vast Expectation, which your Lordship will questionless make good. Wherefore that the present Age may long enjoy your Vertues and Aceomplish∣ments, and Posterity your Ex∣ample, is the zealous Prayer of
My Lord,
