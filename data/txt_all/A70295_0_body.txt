May it Please Your MAJESTY,
FOrasmuch as by Authority derived from your Self, several of us your Subjects, inhabitants in the County of Kent, are now imprisoned; it therefore much concerns Thee, O King, to hear what Accompt we give of our present distressed Condition. Thou hast al∣ready seen our Confession of Faith, wherein our peace∣able Resolutions were declared; we have not viola∣ted any part thereof that should cause that Liberty pro∣mised from Breda, to be with-drawn; And now for our
Principles, that most particularly relate to Magistrates and Government, we have with all clearnesse laid them here before Thee, Humbly beseeching they may be Read patiently; and what we say, weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary; and then judge how worthy we are of either Bonds or Imprisonment; and this we the more earnestly desire, because not only our own lives is in danger, but also an irresistable Destruction co∣meth on our Wives and little Ones, by that violence which is now exercised on us. Disdain not our plainness of Speaking, seeing the Great God accepts of the like. And now, O King, that all Thy Proceedings (both towards us, and all men) may be such as may be plea∣sing unto the eternal God (in whose hands your and our breath is, who ere long will judge both quick and dead, according to their works) is the Prayers of Thy Faith∣ful Subjects and Servants,
