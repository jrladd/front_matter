SIR,
BEfore I enter the Lists with my Adversary, and engage in a pub∣lick Vindication of my self and Fraternity, I
presume to put my self under Your Patro∣nage and Protection; For the World will have good reason to conclude my Com∣plaint true, and my Cause just, when I dare take sanctuary un∣der Your Name, who (besides Your impar∣tial knowledge of us both) are in such (o∣ther) circumstances as render the right or wrong of our preten∣ces
easily discernible to You, and who have long since been well as∣sured of the truths here related, and (by an unquestionable hand) the falshood of those reflections my Anta∣gonist hath made there∣on.
These considerati∣ons encouraged my presumption, and is all the Apology I can make for it. I know there needeth none, for
the smartness where∣with I have treated my Opponent, to a Per∣son that understands so well as You the justice of such resentments, and hath with more bravery vindicated his honour by his Sword, than ever any Writer did an Hypothesis by that sharper Weapon his Pen.
Nor shall I, accor∣ding to custom in ap∣plications of this na∣ture,
seem to bribe and biass Your Favour, by soothing Flourishes, and complementing Harangues, though Your constant and un∣blemish'd Loyalty, Your great Age and Courage, with the wonderful Briskness and Vivacity that accompany them; be Subjects so mani∣festly large and rare for Encomium and Celebration, that I might without flatte∣ry
praise and admire: Yet because severe Men and Censurers will say, It looks more like the mercenary Addresses of Plays and Poems, than Serious∣ness and that Integrity with which I profess to appeal, and defend my self and my Cause, and is an Entertainment which few good men receive with delight; I shall decline it.
But thus much I
dare affirm, That how short soever I may come of obtaining sa∣tisfaction by this me∣thod of vindicating my self, and confuting my malicious Opposer; I am sure of gaining one Point of my design (for which I thank Him) that is, to let the whole World know that I am,
SIR,

Plim. A∣pril 26th 1682.
