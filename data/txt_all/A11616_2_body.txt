I Do (in all duti∣full obseruāce) present vnto the bar of your Mighty, High, Gracious, Reuerend, Ho∣nourable, Worshipfull, and Fauourable Censure, these ll digested labours of some few idle houres:

But lest I should doe lik vnto those, that (vnaduised¦ly) did build the Gates big¦ger then the Citie, I humbly take my leaue; and shall eue remaine
