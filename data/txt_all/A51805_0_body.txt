SIR,
I Must own the first and chiefest Advantage I propos'd to my self in this Play, was, To gain the only Opportunity, perhaps I shall ever have, of acknowledging to the World how very much I am bound to be Yours, not only out of Gratitude but Inclination.
From hence it might be expected, accord∣ing to the Course of Dedications, that I should forget both You and my self in tiring you with your own Praises. No, Sir, I consider to whom I write; nor need you blush at what I am going to say, tho' I know you are more afraid of your Friends on such an Occasion as this, than your Enemies on any other.
Were it possible for me to think of but at∣tempting your Character, I should esteem my self very Happy, if I could reach so far as the Out-lines of the Original. To proceed any further, were to draw upon my self a harder Task than ever any Painter yet had. 'Twere todwell upon Lights altogether without ev'n the Mixture of a Shade.

But if I had Strength to support the Under∣taking, I should beg leave to mention your Affability of Temper, your Perfection in Learning, a Delicacy in your Thoughts, a no∣ble Vivacity in your Expressions, a matchless Fire in your Fancy, and a great Exactness of Judgment: To change the Scene your Perso∣nal Bravery in the Camp, your Gallantry at Court, your Zeal to serve your Friends, your Humanity to all the World, and your easie Dispatch in Business.
Thus consummate in Merit, no wonder your Great Master's Favor should shine upon you with such Distinction as to send so Gal∣lant a Son to succeed so Renown'd a Father in his Commands and Governments Abroad.
Permit me, Sir, on this occasion to wish you a Prosperous Voyage, and all the Happi∣ness that ever Man enjoy'd
I cannot end better than with such a Wish; nor can it be sent to you with greater Ferven∣cy by any one, than
SIR,
