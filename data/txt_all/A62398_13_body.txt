A Simple Sheeps-skin proves the only ty,
And stay whereon a World of men rely,
VVhich hold a crew of Earth-worms in more awe,
Than both the Tables of the secret Law;
For as the Ram and Ewe doeth fructifie,
And ev'ry year a Lamb doeth multiply,
So doeth a Sheeps-skin bound make many breed,
And procreat, as seed doth spring from seed,
It's one mans freedom and anothers loss,
And like the Pope, it both can bind and loose;
Adam Scot in Delorian I do nominate,
And for thy Generation, it cannot be forgot,
Unto Grass-yard thy Brother it is declar'd by me,
VVhich may serve all that is of one Posterity:
And in conclusion this I humbly crave,
That ev'ry one the honesty may have,
That when your frail Mortality is past,
Ye may be the good Shepherds at the last;
Be not offended at the stile of Shepherds-swain,
For Iasons Golden Fleece is still worthy of Coyn.
