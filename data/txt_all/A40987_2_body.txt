Right Honorable,
THis hasty undrest Birth, being forced out of doores by the importunity of divers godly Ministers and Friends, begges a covering from your Honours Name, whose merits are so well known unto the world in those publick imployments to which you have been ingaged, as, if I should attempt to adde any lustre, I should but light a Candle to the Sunne, and shadow that beauty which an abler pensill hath lately drawn.Master Samuel Bolton in his Epist. Dedic. to his Ar∣raignment of Errour. I had not adventured upon the Acumen of your wisdome and parts, for patronage of this in∣firm labour, had not your accustomed candor prompted me with afavourable excuse of this honest ambition, partly from that wel-known love your Honour bears to learning & piety, partly from the cōstant experience of your abundant favours, of which I desire in this smal monument to perpetuate the acknowledge∣ments, and partly from the subject of the first ensuing discourse, which may be not unsuitable to your affection of a cōtemplative retirednes and a contentive sweetnes in your self-injoyments:
your Honour not aspiring great things for your selfe in Ja∣cobs day of small things, most nobly disdaining to make your Morsels fat out of the publick wants, although your losses may be as great as some others.
Heroick Sir, I trust neither of these Sermons will be un∣savoury to your goodnesse, though both unworthy your lear∣ning.
The first Sermon presents you the felicity of an humble content and peaceable retirednesse, a Discourse not unseasona∣ble in times so full of trouble and uncertaintie as ours are.
The second discovers the lawfull ends, and unkind provo∣cations of a Ministers removall, yeelding both an Apologie for the Minister, and an Alarm to the people whatsoever they are. Hope, which is the Mother of Boldnesse, and Mistresse of En∣deavour, hath brought them unto your hands, to do some service to the Church of God. and to your Honour, wherein if they shall be so happy, it will both Comfort and Crowne him who is servant to both
