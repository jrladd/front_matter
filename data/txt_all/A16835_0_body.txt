ALbeit (most Graci∣ous Soueraigne) I might be vvoorthily noted of presumption, in dedica∣ting these my trauailes to your Maiestie, as vvel for the basenesse of my skill & calling, as for the vn∣reuerent demeanour of the aduersaries that here I ansvvere, vnvvorthie vvhom your Highnesse should deigne to loke vpon: yet, bothe bicause the matter entreateth moste of a Princes estate, and that vpon the chiefest point ther∣of, belonging in general to al Christian Princes, but in especiall to your Maiestie, against vvhom they chief∣ly direct their malice, and in maintenaunce vvhereof your Maiestie direct your gouernement, and herein haue giuen a mirror to al christian Princes to folovv, and be partakers in their common vveales, of the lyke blessings, wherwith God hath beautified your High∣nesse, and established youre authoritie: I thought it therfore not vnfit (setting my self and them aside, with

all such by matters as incidently fal out in disputation, betvvixt the Bishop and master Feckenham, of me & these my aduersaries▪ to conecrate this argumente of Supremacie to youre moste excellent Maiestie, as to vvhom chiefly in your dominions, next vnder Christ it dothe pertaine. VVhich your Highnesse so nobly maintaines by practise of godlie gouernment, hovve euer we by the vvord and argument do defend it.
There is no controuersie at this day betvvixt vs and the enimies of the gospel more impughed, thā this one of the Supremacie, nor more bookes compiled more libels scattered, more vaunts made of truth on their partie, more sclaunders deuised of oure doctrine, and your Maiesties Title, more secrete conspiracies and open treasons against your Royal person and state of the Realme: than our aduersaries make, only for this Supremacie. Shall Sathan then vse al this double dili∣gence, in promoting the pride & tyrannie of his An∣tichrist, the man of sinne, the foreigne vsurper of all Christian kingdoms: and shall the children of God. be negligent in defence of the kingdom of Christ, of the Lordes anoynted, of the dutifull office and lavv∣full authoritie of their naturall Soueraigne▪
Other meanes (I graunt) may be had to suppresse their furious dealing. And God bee blessed therefore that hath furnished your Maiestie vvith povver, coū∣sell, authoritie, lavv, vvisedome learning, vertue, cou∣rage, and al other Princely habilities▪ suffiiet to main∣tein your Highnesse Title, & protect that portion of Christes Church, vvhich he hath committed to your

most Gracious gouernment, in peace and truth pros∣perously,  your enemies. VVherein as your Maiestie hath euer most zlously sought and set forth the glorie of god, e hath so glorified you again, as he hath promised, , glorificabo: that your high∣nesse may say as king Dauid sayd▪ he hath deliuered you out of your enimies hands, and defeated all their purposes, he hath established you a kingdom here on earth in peace and righteousnesse, and hath prepared in heauen a Kingdom for you in glorie and eternitie.
Novv although this be so cleee, that euen the eni∣mies themselues cōfesse, God vvorks vvith you, God fights for you, God hath takē your hart into his han∣des, that haue taken his quarel into yours: yet sith the  do mutte & sclander your Highnesse, to take suche kind of Gouernmēt on you, as vvere not cōpetent, as the Pope had vvont to do, & your High∣nes is furthest from: if this your claime be not proued to be groūdedon Gods vvord, if those enuious be not cōinced by euident argumēts of the seripture, al the foresaid prosperitie is coūted but earthly blessings, and such as other vvorldly Princes haue. All the due au∣thoritie is  but extorted violence: neither is the mouth of the adoersarie stopped, neyther is the mind of the subiect satisfied. And therfore vvhen al is don▪ there is no better mean to may  this Title, than euen by learning &  for to me it to the vtter∣most, and to fight vvit the vveapon of Gods vvord for it, vvhiches sharpe to vvonde the aduersaries heart and conscience, than any tvvo edged svvord.
But some vvil say, this is sufficiently done, by other learned labours, vvhen both in the dayes of your Ma∣iesties Father of most renoumed memorie, euen the best learned of our aduersaries did not only confesse it, but vvrote so effectually in defence therof, that shame∣fully aftervvard reuolting, their guiltie consciēcebore vvitnesse against themselues, nor they coulde euer an∣svvere their ovvne vvritings. And also after that, in the godlie gouernment of youre Highnesse blessed Brother, many other more excellent fathers, in vvri∣ting did confirme it. And novv lastly in this your Ma∣iesties happie Reigne, diuers famous and lerned men, to the further confirming of the godlie, and confoun∣ding the enimie therein, haue vvritten vppon this ar∣gument. Yet sith oure aduersaries haue neuer doone thervvith, but sette on a freshe, lyke to him that vvhen in vvrastling he was euer cast, of pride and vainglorie vvoulde neuer acknovvledge that he had any fall: I thought good to make euident to all your Maiesties subiects, & euen to the enimies themselues, the places vvhere they shamefully fel, and lie stil in their errour, rather than to vvrastle vvith such vvarblers. And yet if they start vp again, to trie a further pluck vvith them, and by the strength of Gods inuincible truth, so to o∣uerthrovv them: that as fast as they boast, cauill, and sclaunder: the truth of our cause, and the goodnesse of your Maiesties quarell, shall shevve it selfe the clee∣rer, although the simplier handled.
A number of other vvhom I knovve, coulde haue done it farre better, vvho may also at their discretions

further trauaile in it. And in deede (vvhere the most of this vvas done a good vvhile sith) it vvas layde aside thus long, expecting if any other vvould attempte it. But sith none hath aduentured on it, I thought it my dutie to yeelde to the godlie and vrgent requestes of those personages, that vnderstanding I had priuately delte therin, required the publishing of my labours, to the vvhich I condescended a great deale the vvillinger, partly bicause it touched vvithall, the defence of that Reuerende fathers innocencie and learning, the Bi∣shop of VVinchester, vvho had, although briefly, yet most orderly and exactly, handled this questiō before, and vvas oppugned by this aduersarie, neither vvas it for diuers causes thought so cōuenient for the Bishop himselfe to ansvvere, and I for my part was bounde in so iust a cause to defend him. But chiefly for that it spared not most opprobriously to slaunder your most excellēt Maiestie, your title, your state, your gouern∣ment, your most honorable and godlie Coūsaile, your nobilitie, your Bishops, your clergie, your magistrats, your iustices, your people, and all estates of your do∣minions, your doctrine, your faith, your religion, yea the truth and glorie of God, vvhich your Highnesse defendes, to all vvhich, I and all other are bounde in principall. I thought not good therefore to stay it a∣ny longer, and suffer these vncircumcised Philistines blaspheming the truth of God, reproching the Lords anoynted, and rayling on the hoste of Israel, to stand thus and vaunt vnansvvered: but lette this ansvvere that I had thus farforth made in priuate▪ come abrode

to others. Promising (god vvilling) by your Maiesties fauourable protection, to deale further vvith them, and to shevvethe continuall practise hereof, hovve in all ages, since Christendome began to flourishe vnder the Great Constantine, that christian Emperors, Kings and Princes, haue dealte as doth your Maiestie in the ouersight of Ecclesiastical matters, till the Pope by lit∣tle and little encroching on them, not onely spoyled them of this their chief authoritie, but of their tempo∣ral estates and vvorldly kingdoms, yea of their goodes & liues also. In the meane season for this that is here alreadie ansvvered vnto, I most humbly craue your Highnesse acceptation, vvhose right is here defended by truth from sclanders, that by iustice defendeth our right from iniuries. Most hartily beseeching almigh∣tie God, as he hitherto hath vouchsafed, so to blesse, preserue, continue and prosper your Royal Maiestie, to the lōg establishing of your Highnes Throne, to the vtter vanquishing of all your spiritu∣all and bodily, priuie and open enimies, to the godlie comforte and quiet gouernment of all your faithful subiects, and to the prosperous aduance∣ment of Gods euerlasting glorie, tho∣rough Iesus Christe.
AMEN.
