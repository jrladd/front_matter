Sir,
ALbeit all the Crown'd Heads of Eu∣rope, who are so by Inheritance, be concerned in the Vindication of the Marriage of Robert the 2d. King of Scotland with Elizabeth Mure, yet Your Majesty hath the greatest interest therein: the Collection of the Proofs now Published, was made by me many years ago, and Presented formerly in Write to Your Majesty; I did likewise Communicat them to others, who have Printed imperfect Accounts thereof: and some English-men having lately Endeavoured by their scandalous Pas∣quels, to cast Reproach on the Series of all the English Kings and Queens; and desirous to pull those of Scotland into the Contagion, Alleadge this only Tash of the Bastardy of K. Robert the 3d. Son to Elisabeth Mure. If any English-man zealous of the Ho∣nour

of their Crown and Kingdom shall Vin∣dicat their Royal Family from the Libels as clearly as I have done ours, his Book may have a due Reception. this Vindica∣tion was the Design of my Travel, and if with that it be Acceptable to Your Majesty, all that's wish't to it is then attained by,
May it please Your Majesty,
