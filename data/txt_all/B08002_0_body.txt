CONSIDERYNGE often ty∣mes in my selfe, (my syngular good lorde) the inestimable gra∣ces and benefytes, with the whi∣che god of his infinite goodnes hath moste largely indewed our moste souerayne lorde the kynges mooste noble maiestie, wherof his grace hath abundantly im∣parted also vnto vs his mooste humble and lo∣uynge subiectes, by the illustration of goddis moste holy worde, and vnto what consolation, ioye, and comforet, from oure longe peynefully suffered thraldome, dreadefulle darkenes, and daungers of our bodies, soules, and all that we had besydes forth, we be nowe most blessedly de∣lyuered and comme, throughe the same, I haue thought and yet assuredly do thynke, there is no faythfull or true englyshe hart, that can reteyne and kepe to hym selfe the memoriall therof, and not ernestly and with al diligence indeuour and apply hym selfe, by all suche meanes and ways,

as his wytte power and counnynge, whiche god hath gyuen hym, wylle serue hym, to vtter and set forthe the same, bothe to the condigne laude and prayse of god therfore, and vnto the perpe∣tuall renowne and gloriouse fame of our sayde moste soueraygne lorde, as the very minister, in and by whome GOD hathe thus wonderfully wrought in vs, and as in whom (as Paul saith) our reioysynge myght abounde and increase by Philipp. 1. Iesu Christe, by reason of his returne home a∣gayne to his right and iuste title of godly mini∣stration and power ouer vs, wherof he, and his moste noble progenytours, haue ben vniustely, by vsurpacion, longe depriued. Wherevpon for my part, in discharge of my conscience and due∣tie towardes god & his maiestie in this behalfe, I haue applyed my best wyll (accordynge to my Matth. 25. litell, and not vnknowen to all men moste least) gyfte, whiche I haue thankefully (notwithstan∣dynge) receyued of god amongest other, to be∣stowe and employe to his vse, to compyle this lyttell treatyse, vpon the ioyfull psalme, Benedi∣ctus dominus deus Israel. &c. the glad prophecye and Luc. 1. praysegyuynge vnto god by zachary, whiche by interpretation is asmoch to say, as remembring god, of and for the vniuersall spirituall visita∣tion and redemption of mankynde, by Christis becommynge incarnate, and commendation of his chosen mynister thervnto, Iohn Baptiste: wherof and of whose conception also he was in∣opinable at the tyme of the reuelation therof, by

reason of the very old ages of him and his wife, to thentēt the same, which I wold to god were as effectuously shewed and set forth by me herin, as I haue bothe hartily and faythfully pourposed and ment it, myght be an occasion and example for vs, bothe to laude and prayse god of and for our specyal visytation and redemption, through the lyght of goddis most holy worde, wherof we were also inopinable and faythelesse at the fyrste pronouncynge thereof, by reason that the same was longe hydde from vs, and mannes tradi∣tions and inuentions crepte betwene. And also to commende worthely our sayd most souerayne lorde, goddes holy minister therof, in perpetuall memory, and from generation of vs into gene∣ration, leste we whiche as adoptiue Israelytes by faythe do presently enioye so hyghe and god∣ly benefytes by god and his sayde mynyster the kynges maiestie, shulde be accompted any lesse thankefull therfore, then was zacharie, who be∣ing satisfied with only hope, thanked and prai∣sed God and his holy mynyster Iohn Baptiste, for the merites of Christes incarnation, then to come. Whyche Treatise moste temeraryously I haue dedycate vnto you, whom I haue always estemed, lyke the ryght vertuous and faythfull Saphan, vnto his moste godly prynce Iosias, a gracious fauourer of all honest and holy pur∣poses, and my very syngular good lorde: Tru∣stynge that although bothe for the grosse hand∣lynge of so fyne a matter, and also the rude and

inornate style and phrase therof, it be nothynge worthy suche preferrement in dede, yet neuer the lesse your accustomed benignite wyl vouchsafe to reform the same, wherin it may seme vn∣to you conuenient, & also accept and make it worthye, agreinge to my good wyl intended ther∣in. And for my parte, I shall not onely most hartly prayse and thanke god therfore, but also accordinge to my bounden duetie owe vnto your good lordeshyppe my harty prayer and hum∣ble seruyce whyle I lyue.
GOD SAVE THE KYNGE
