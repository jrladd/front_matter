MADAM,
THis little book makes bold to adress it self to your Sacred Majestie, not to inform or in∣struct you in any thing it con∣taines, for beside the gifts of na∣ture and great perfections, with which your Majestie is so richly indowed; you had the advātage of being born & bred in the most Catholick Country of Europe, & beīg well educated & throwly instructed in vertue, piety, religiō & in all other things, proper for so great a Princess to learn. The end and scope of this small trea∣tise

is Madam; first to answer a Challēge made to all Catholicks in General, by one of the most da∣reing, & most presumptuous of the protesāt it party; next to pre∣vent unwary, and well meaning Christians from being seduc'd, or impos'd upon by such artifices which it will effect by Gods help; so it be but countenanc'd by your Sacred Majestie; If you consider only its style & contexture, or the Author that compos'd it, it cānot on either of those accounts de∣serve this honour: but the Doct∣trine it comprehends, being com∣piled & faithfully extracted out of the scripture, holy Fathers, & Ancient Coūcils, it may on that score well pretend the patronage & protection of so great a Quen; a

descēded from the Glori∣ous House of Est, which has fur∣nish'd Europe for many hunderds of years, with Illustrious Dukes & Princes, Famous Generals, great states-men & most Eminent prelates, & Church-men; & yet never did oblige it more than in giving it so great a Princess, so fit a consort for our Gratious King, whose piety & zeal are with-out example, who for his re∣ligion only, has lost the Imperial crown of three Kingdoms, & for his great resignation, & Christiā patience, will infallibly receive a crown of everlastīg Glory; your Majestyes Heroycal & sted fast resolution of still prefering reli∣gio beforé all Temporal inrest, and your great zeal for the ser∣vice

of God & the Catholick cause do evidently prove that no other Princess, but yourself could be so agreable to his Majestie; & so conformable to his generous in∣clinations in this particular, as well as in all other Royal perfec∣tions. The King, & your Majes∣ties chief study is to maītaī & sup∣port that religion for which both have sacrific'd your all; & your daily businesse is to comfort the poor, to cloath the naked, & to feed the hungry, to provide for the Fatherless & widowes, & to supply all their wāts, ever to the straitning of yourselves; & in a word to promote in others' by your own example the practice of all the workes of piety & Charity imaginable. Now since standing∣up

in defence of truth & endea∣vouring to instruct the ignorant in matters of salvation, has ever been accounted a work of Chari∣ty, this little book, (how ever meanly write) may deservé your Majestie's Royal protectiō & approbation, this will render it more acceptable to all good Chri∣stians, & supply it's want where∣ever it is defective either in lan∣guage or composition; for this reason Madam, the Author does most humbly presume to lay it at your Majesties feet, & to beg you wou'd be Graciously pleas'd not only to afford it the honour of your Royal patronage; but also ot accept of it, as a small testimo¦ny of the fidelity, & greatfull respect, justly due from all his

Country, where with he is ob∣lig'd daily to pray for your Majestie, & ever to continue.
MADAM,
