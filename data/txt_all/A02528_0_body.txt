RIGHT HO:
Vpon how iust reason these my Contemplations goe forth so late after their fellowes, it were needlesse to giue account to your LO: in whose trayne I had the honor (since my last) to passe both the SEA, and the TWEDE. All my priuate studies haue gladly vayled to the publique seruices of my Soueraigne Master: No



sooner could I recouer the happinesse of my quiet thoughts, then I renued this my diuine taske: Wherein I cannot but pro∣fesse to place so much contentment, as that I wish not any other measure of my life, then it; What is this other, then the ex∣altation of ISAACS delight to walke forth into the pleasant fields of the Scrip∣tures, and to meditate of nothing vnder heauen? Yea what other then IACOBS sweet vision of Angels, climbing vp and downe that sacred ladder, which GOD hath set betwixt heauen and earth? Yea (to rise yet hyer) what other then an imitation of holy MOYSES, in his con∣uersing with GOD himselfe, on the Horeb of both Testaments? And if I may call your LO: forth a little from your great affaires of Court and State, to blesse your eyes with this prospect, how happy shall you confesse this change of ob∣iects? and how vnwillingly shall you ob∣taine leaue of your thoughts to returne vnto these sublunary imployments? Our last discourse left Gods ARKE amongst

From thence you shall see the dangerous issue of an affected in∣novation, although to the better; The er∣rors of credulitie, and blinde affection in the holiest gouernors, guilty of the peoples discontentment; The stubburne heddi∣nesse of a multitude that once findes the reynes slacke in their necks, not capable of any pause, but their owne fall; The vn∣trusty promises of a faire outside, and a plausible entrance, shutting vp in a wofull disappointment. What doe I forestall a discourse so full of choyce; your LO: shall finde ecry line vsefull, and shall



willingly confesse that the story of God can make a man not lesse wise, then good.
Mine humble thankfulnes knowes not how to expresse it selfe otherwise, then in these kinde of presents, and in my hearty prayers for the increase of your Honor, and Happinesse, which shall neuer bee wanting from
