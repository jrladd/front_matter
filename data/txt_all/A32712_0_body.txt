MADAM,
THe excellent Monsieur Des Cartes, I remember, in his Dedicatory Epistle of his Principles of Philoso∣phy, to that illustrious La∣dy, the Princess Elizabeth; shewed Himself so much a Courtier, as to profess unto Her Highness, that of all Persons living, who had perused his former Writings, He knew none, that perfectly understood them, except Herself only. This, Madam, is somewhat more than

what I shall adventure to say to you, in this my humble Address. Not that I might not, with the Authority of Truth, and the willing Testimonies of all judicious Persons, whom you have at any time dignified with your incomparable Conversation, affirme; That A∣cuteness of Wit, and Soundness of Iudgement are as Eminent in you, as in any that I know, of either Sex. But, that I conceive it to be more consistent with my Duty of Conformity to the strict Laws of your Humi∣lity (which is supreme among your many Virtues, if there can be Supremacy where All are Superlative) only to ask you leave, so far to justifie My self, in this way of Devotion, as publikely to own my Assurance; that of all my Readers, none will meet with fewer Difficulties, or discover more Lapses and Errors, than your self: nor could that Book be clearly understood by the Author, when He wrote it, which you cannot easi∣ly understand, when you are pleased to read it; be the Argument thereof of what kind soever, and the Lan∣guage either Italian, French, or English, which are all equally your own.
But, I have little reason to speak of justifying this my Devotion, to the World; when that, by the Ge∣neral Tribute of Admiration and Reverence, which your Excellencies duely receive from it, is fully con∣vinced, that I am not capable of declaring a greater Prudence, in any action of my whole life, than in this of laying down both my self and this mean Oblation of my Observance and Gratitude, at the feet of a Personage, whose single Name is acknowledged to define All the pos∣sible Perfections of Humanity: and, upon consequence, cannot fail to give to both Me and my Writings not on∣ly

an Estimation among Good Men; but also a full Pro∣tection from the Malevolence of Evil. And, I have been very lately told by some (and Those such Eminent Witts too; as that very Noble Persons, to whom they have Dedicated their Labours, have thereby received no small Additions of Honour) that they seriously Envi∣ed the good fortune of my resolution of invocating your Patronage of this Epicurean Philosophy; forasmuch as they were confirmed, that I had taken the most certain course, to procure Immortality thereunto, by offering it up to the Favour of so great an Example of all Heroick Accomplishments, as that Her Memory must ever con∣tinue verdant and sacred to all Posterity since it could not be, while Generous Minds should conserve the Me∣morials of Her as the Mirrour in which Vertue used to dresse Herself, when she would appear Amiable and Graceful; but that they must often cast some glances of valew upon the Remains of Him, who had so deep a sentiment of Her goodness, as to have known no other Ambition, but that commendable one of making Him∣self eternally known for Her most humble and obsequious Votary.
That, which would more become me, were to make my Excuses for the exceeding Boldness of this my Ap∣plication; and to pravent such Objections as may lye against the Rashness of my Zeal: in selecting such a way to express my Reverence, as cannot secure me from a su∣spect of Prophanation; and praesenting to you such a Sa∣crifice of my Thankfulness, as, if estimated according to its own Vnworthiness, must make it a quaestion, whether I had any designe of being Thankful at all. And here, to the First, I might justly plead; that a great Part of

this Volume was composed in your House (the chief Mansion of well-order'd Hospitality) and All of it in the strength of your Inspiration. That the Book comes not into your hands, to Informe, but only Remember you of many of those Discourses of Nature, which your No∣ble Husband and your self have often suffered me to en∣tertain (would to God, I might have said, satisfy) your eager Curiosity withal, at those hours your industrious Minds required Relaxation from the bent of more grave and advantageous Thoughts. That, having the Honour of so great a Trust, as that of your most prae∣cious Lives committed unto me; it highly concern'd me, to study and pursue all ways of Demonstrating my self not altogether uncapable thereof, and more especially this of Natural Philosophy, which being the Grounds, is also the Measure of a Good Physician. And, that when your Husband being acquainted with my Purpose of Enqui∣ring into the Nature of Souls, both Brutal and Human, in a distinct Work, though but the Remaining Moity of this Physiologie; had injoyned me to deliver the same in∣to his hands, as soon as I should have finished it: I instant∣ly apprehended, I had an opportunity of a Double Happi∣ness, the one of being equally Grateful to Two singular Friends; the other, of Allying those Two Treatises by Consecration, which would be of so neer Affinity in their Subjects.
As for the Other; I might easily alleage, that Great spirits use not to estimate Praesents that are brought them, by the value they carry in themselves: but the Affecti∣ons of those who offer them. That Thank fulness is the Poor mans wealth, and makes him, in the eyes of Gene∣rosity, stand in competition, for respect, with the Rich. That though this my Oblation hold no proportion to the

immense height of your Merit, yet it is equal to that of my Power, and, indeed, the best that my Gratitude was able to advance upon the slender stock of my Capacity. And, that I never intended it as a Retribution fr your incompensable Favours; but only as an Homage, to testi∣fie that I confess my self infinitely your Debtor.
But, Madam, for me to attempt to Excuse, unto your self, the Vnfitnesse of this Act of my devotion; is no lesse unnecessary, than for me to justifie to the World, that I have placed it upon a most worthy Object: forasmuch as I have no more reason to doubt, that so transcendent a Charity, as is diffused through and surrounds your per∣fect Soul, can be large enough to dispense with the Rude∣ness of the Ceremonies, and Poverty of the Offering, where you are satisfied of the sincere Respects, and un∣alterable Fidelity of his Heart, who tenders it; than I have to fear, that the World should not most readily con∣firm my judgement, that your Deserts have rightfully entitled you to all the Demonstrations of Honour and Reveence, that can possibly be given to you.
The Chief part, therefore, yea the whole of my pre∣sent Duty, is only humbly to Beg your benigne Accept∣ance of this Dedication, as the Best Expression I was able to make of those profound sentiments which as well your Goodness in General to others, as your Particular Favours to my self, have impressed upon my Soul. And this I now do, upon the Knees of my Heart; and solemnly vow, that as I esteem a perfect Friend, the greatest Treasure of my life, so I do and ever shall ac∣count you the most perfect of Friends: That I shall confess my self to have lost not only all Piety, but all

Humanity also, when ever I shall willingly lose any the least opportunity of serving you: and that your own Good Angell (I speak familiarly, but at the same time believe you to be under the Tuition of a Legion of Good ones) cannot more fervently desire your complete Happiness, than, Incomparable Madam,

London
the 20 of Iuly, An. Dom. 1654.
