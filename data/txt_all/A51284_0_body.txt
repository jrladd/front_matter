MADAME,
THe high opinion or rather certain
knowledge I have of your singu∣lar
Wit and Vertues, has emboldened,
or to speak more properly, command∣ed
me to make choice of none other then
yourself for a Patronesse of this pre∣sent
Treatise. For besides that I do your
Ladiship that Right as also this present
Age and succeeding Posterity, as to be
a witnesse to the World of such emi∣nent
Accomplishments & transcendent
Worth; so I do not a little please my self,
while I find my self assured in my own
conceit that Cebes his mysterious & ju∣dicious
Piece of Morality hung up in
the Temple of Saturne, which was done
in way of Divine Honour to the Wis∣dome
of the Deity, was not more safely

and suteably placed then this carefull
Draught of Natural Theology or
Metaphysicks, which I have dedicated
to so noble, so wise, and so pious a Perso∣nage.
And for my own part it seems to
me as reall a point of Religious wor∣ship
to honour the Vertuous as to re∣lieve
the Necessitous, wch Christianity
terms no lesse then a Sacrifice. Nor is
there any thing here of Hyperbolisme
or high-flow'n Language, it being agreed
upon by all sides, by Prophets, Apostles,
and ancient Philosophers, that holy
and good Men are the Temples of the
Living God. And verily the Residence
of Divinity is so conspicuous in that He∣roical
Pulchritude of your noble Per∣son,
that Plato if he were alive again
might finde his timorous Supposition
brought into absolute Act, & to the enra∣vishment

of his amazed Soul might be∣hold
Vertue become visible to his out∣ward
sight. And truly Madame, I must
confesse that so Divine a Constitution
as this, wants no Preservative, being
both devoid & uncapable of Infection;
and that if the rest of the World had
attain'd but to the least Degree of this
sound Complexion & generous frame
of Minde, nay if they were but brought
to an aequilibrious Indifferency, and, as
they say, stood but Neutralls, that is, If
as many as are supposed to have no love of
God, nor any knowledge or experience of
the Divine life, did not out of a base
ignorant fear irreconcilably hate him,
assuredly this Antidote of mine would
either prove needless and superfluous, or,
if Occasion ever called for it, a most
certain Cure. For this Truth of the

Existence of God being as clearly
demonstrable as any Theorem in Ma∣thematicks,
it would not fail of win∣ning
as firm and as universall Assent,
did not the fear of a sad After-clap
pervert mens Vnderstandings, and
Prejudice and Interest pretend un∣certainty
& obscurity in so plain a mat∣ter.
But considering the state of things
as they are, I cannot but pronounce, that
there is more necessity of this my An∣tidote
then I could wish there were.
But if there were lesse or none at all, yet
the pleasure that may be reaped in per∣usal
of this Treatise, (even by such as
by an holy Faith & divine Sense are e∣ver
held fast in a full assent to the Con∣clusion
I drive at) will sufficiently com∣pensate
the pains in the penning therof.
For as the best Eyes & most able to be∣hold

the pure Light do not unwillingly
turn their backs of the Sun to view his
refracted Beauty in the delightfull co∣lours
of the Rainbow; so the perfectest
Minds & the most lively possest of the
Divine Image, cannot but take content∣ment
& pleasure in observing the glori∣ous
Wisdome & Goodness of God so
fairly drawn out and skilfully variega∣ted
in the sundry Objects of externall
Nature. Which delight though it re∣dound
to all, yet not so much to any as to
those that are of a more Philosophicall
& Contemplative constitution; & there∣fore
Madame, most of all to Yourself,
whose Genius I know to be so specula∣tive,
& Wit so penetrant, that in the
knowledge of things as well Natural as
Divine you have not onely out gone all of
your own Sexe, but even of that other al∣so,

whose ages have not given them over∣much
the start of you. And assuredly
your Ladiship's Wisedome and Judge∣ment
can never be highly enough com∣mended,
that makes the best use that may
be of those ample Fortunes that Di∣vine
Providence has bestow'd upon you.
For the best result of Riches, I mean in
reference to ourselves, is, that we finding
ourselves already well provided for, we
may be fully Masters of our own time:
& the best improvement of this time is
the Contemplation of God and Na∣ture,
wherein if these present Labours
of mine may prove so gratefull unto you
and serviceable, as I have been bold to
presage, next to the winning of Soules
from Atheisme, it is the sweetest Fruit
they can ever yield to
