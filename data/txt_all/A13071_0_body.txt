WHen it came neere my turne to reade, and that I had entred into the choice of my Statute, euen then my body (wasted with long sicknes and disease) called vp∣on me to consider rather of my death; and that so withdrew my minde from the positiue Lawe I had in hand, as that it setled my thoughts vpon that eternall law of God, wherby Statutum est hminibus &c. It is appoynted vnto men that they shall once dye, and afterward come to iudge∣ment; and when I had spent some time thereon, it did not only disswade me from mine intended enterprise to reade, and perswade me to giue way to a more fit Reader, but gaue me also such comfort and content, as that thereout, I straight way affected to impart it vnto you, to whom I shall euer wish as your Foster-brother, all satisfaction in the things of best vse, to∣ward
 your prosperitie in this life, and glorious estate in the life to come; excuse I pray you the forme it cō∣meth to you in, as issuing from a minde affected at that instant, with the order of a Temple reading, and therefore could receiue no other impression then of the same kinde; which neuerthelesse as it is, I doe not presume to addresse vnto you for your instruction, but for your incoragement and incitation, that you (knowing me to be heauie and slow by nature, and little bettered by any art, and yet to haue by constant and diligent hearing of godly sermons, and that only at our appoynted houres, and by addition of some things (sorting with the matter) collected out of my readings, gathered such store of Diuine notes, as that thereout, I may present you with such a common place as this) might from thence consider, what ex∣cellent things may be compassed by you, who as well for your naturall endowments, as your liberall bring∣ing vp, doe farre exceede not only my selfe, but ma∣ny other every way afore me; and this also you may performe without the least preiudice to your prescri∣bed studies; for if your indeauours this way be but accompanied with delight, the one will be a recreati∣on, yea, a very apt helpe to the other; For what ma∣xime of the Common Law of this kingdom can you cite, whereby our infinite, and those most variable poynts and questions are decided, that is not groun∣ded, or originally deriued from the eternall law of God, either by direct precept, or by consequent im∣plication: What I haue done in this my poore and simple labours is a part of my negotiation with that
 one Talent I haue receaued from the Lord, which I am desirous to put to the vttermost profite. And al∣though perhaps for my selfe to be seene in the presse in a matter of this kinde, will be to some as great a wonder as Saul among the Prophets, yet had I rather by doing of some good this way, lay open my infirmities to the censure of men, then with the idle seruant to hide my Talent in the earth; Accept ther∣fore I pray you this my present, with that kinde affec∣tion I doe intend it, and then I hope it shall either profit you in the reading, as it hath done me in the compiling, or at least, stirr you vp to correct and amend it by your owne endeauours, for your better vse and comfort: And so wishing to you as to my selfe, I rest euer at your seruice,
