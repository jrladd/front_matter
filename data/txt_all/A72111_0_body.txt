RIGHT HONOVRABLE:
TO tell you these Times are times of Danger in the matter of Religion especially, and that they are indeed those later Dayes, which our bles∣sed Lord and his Apo∣stles foretold long agoe, wherein Faith should scarcely bee found on Earth, because the Iniquitie of many shall abound, were nothing else but to take vp the vsuall Theame of
the times, which euery Pulpit ringeth of, and all men doe or may heare of day by day, as many as liue vnder a conscionable Ministrie. But to make demonstra∣tion of some particulars wherein that danger stan∣deth, and to discouer some of those closer Conveyan∣ces which are practised in that Mysterie of Iniquitie, cannot chuse but be a worke acceptable to all knowing men; the rather because the Doctrines and Positi∣ons of later times (as one well obserueth of them) like to Watermen vpon the Thames, set their faces one way, and row another. Amongst whom the Positions and Tenents of that Society of Iesuites, challenge all priority: For these men, aboue all others whom this last Century of yeares hath produced, haue the right tricke of it (as a Duke of Venice spoke wittily of them) with the one hand, to point vs the way towards Hea∣ven, and with the other hand to cheate vs of our tem∣porall possessions, vnder a colour of Religion, and cloke of Holinesse, trading for Kingdomes and Empires, and Soules of Men, Revel. 18.13.
It now draweth neare vpon an hundred yeares com∣pleat, since this Sect was first brought vpon the Stage of the Christian world, by a superstitious Spanish Souldier, named; INIGO LOIOLA, a man not more lame in his limbes, then in his Religion: how∣beit his Disciples since his death, haue Christened him a new, for his and their owne further credit, into the name of IGNATIVS DE LOIOLA: Since which time; what wonders haue beene wrought by that So∣cietie, not in Christendome onely, but also in the re∣motest Nations, their owne Annals doe relate; I will not say how truely, and our eyes haue seene, and our
eares haue heard not without astonishment, for they are the Spirits of Divels working Myracles, to goe therewith to the Kings of the Earth, and to the whole World, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. Revel. 16.14.
And yet howbeit they haue power giuen them from God, as a iust plague to toment and hurt tht vnbelee∣uing and disobedient world, their power and times are limited, their power is to torment and hurt onely, their time but for Fiue Moneths. Revel. 9.10.
How neare they are now growne to such a Bulke, as they can hardly haue either meanes, or hope to inlarge, all wise and vnderstanding men discerne: and howeuer they flatter their great Catholicke Maister with hopes of a fifth Monarchy (for they haue a King ouer them, whose name is APOLLYON, the Destroyer, as Revel. 9.11. that Vniuersall Disturber of the peace of Chri∣stendome): yet we are not ignorant, nor could them∣selues be so, (if ambition of Temporall Glory, had not blinded them quite) that a fifth Monarchie in this case, is more by one, then DANIEL ever Prophecied.
I am halfe perswaded, that the conclusion of this hundred of yeares which is now expired within ten, since these Iesuites first appeared in the Christi∣an world, shall shew to Christendome, and to the whole world, an vnexpected and incredible alteration, in the Body of this Monster.
And I am the rather induced to thinke so; because, I haue here vnderstood as much in effect, from a couple of their owne, men for learning and ingenuity second to none (for any thing I can perceiue) that euer that Societie bred. Who hauing beene educated many
yeares together, euen from their youth vpward in that Sect, and being (euen when they began to grow into yeares) illuminated by the beames of Gods more fauo∣rable and blessed spirit, forsooke that Society, vpon mature deliberation, not for want of meanes or prefer∣ment, or any such Temporall discontentment, but meerely and onely, Motu Divino, as may sufficiently appeare by their ensuing discourse: and that no lesse then 50. yeares agoe, as the date thereof testifieth: when the greatest part of those Mischiefes, which now ouerspread the face of the whole Christian world, were but in the shell: and those spirituall wickednesses, which at this day rule in high places, were onely Con∣ceptions, and a meere Embryo.
Now the same reasons, which caused these two most learned and graue Fathers, to renounce that double fa∣ced Societie in those times, may now (doubtlesse) much more preuaile with vnderstanding men, to whom I de∣sire to Minister this Discouery, as an Antidote a∣gainst Iesuitisme: forasmuch, as our eyes haue now seene those things, or the greatest part thereof, punctu∣ally fulfilled, which these men, by obseruation of the Designes of that Society, haue so long since foreseene, and so truely foretold: Witnesse Bonemia, Germa∣ny, part of Denmarke, and part of France, with their late atchieuement at Rochel, the Towne wherein that Copie was printed, out of which I haue extracted some part of this Discouerie.
But I will not forestall the insuing Relation, with a tedious Epistle: For I dare say that your Honours and Worships are not ignorant, that as to particularize the Impostures of these times, in Divine things, is a
labour not fit for mortalitie to vndertake, seeing the Pen of such an one as might be accounted a Saint for his labour, would hazard to be blunted in the perfor∣mance thereof: So, to anatomize the Multifarious and intricate subtilties of that pragmaticall Societie of Iesuites, were a worke almost of equall difficulty, and might beget no lesse wonder.
What I haue beene enabled to doe herein, I doe hum∣bly praise God for, and doe as gladly and freely dedi∣cate to your Honors acceptation, hoping that where the language shall seeme to sound harshly, you will fauou∣rably pardon it and consider me, as little better then a Translator, bound to tread in the steps of another.
And if hereby, you shall be any way better infor∣med then formerly, touching those strong Delusions, wherewith Sathan, by meanes of this Societie, labou∣reth to deceiue the very Elect, giue God the praise, and let my weake, but well-meant indeavours, receiue a fauourable construction, as being intended for the good of my Country in generall; but especially, as a testimoniall of my due respect and seruice, who rest for the welfare of the Honourable and Graue Senate of this Citie,
