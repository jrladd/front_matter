AFter harty salutacions
letting al other matters
passe, these chiefly are to sig¦nifye
vnto you: That here
of late hath hapned a won∣derful
cure of a Mayd with
in this Citye, wrought by
Gods power in his faithful
Minister & Preacher of Je∣sus
Christ, Mayster Lane,
to the auancement of Gods
glory, and to the great mar¦ueiling
of all those inhabi∣ting
in these partes. And
least the same should be mis¦reported,
or the wicked suf∣fred

to wrest thinges, to a∣buse
Gods Preachers, & for
that the thyng is so rare &
notable that it shoulde not
be kept from the posteritye,
I haue therfore sēt you the
whole tru discourse therof,
described with the hande of
Syr Wyllyam Caluerley
knight, Richard Hurleston
Esquire, and myne own. I
could haue had euerye man
here to haue done the lyke,
but cōsidering we haue had
good profe the one with the
other, I thought this shall
suffice, praying you to put
the same in print.
From the City of Chester the .xv. of
March. 1564.
