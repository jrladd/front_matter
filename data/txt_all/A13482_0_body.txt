OF Subjects (my dread Liege) 'tis manifest,
You have the old'st, the greatest, & the least;
That for an Old, a Great, and Little man,
No kingdom (sure) compare with Britain can;
One, for his extraordinary stature,
Guards well your gates, & by instinct of Nature
(As hee is strong) is Loyall, True, and Iust,
Fit, and most able, for his Charge and Trust.
The other's small and well composed feature
Deserves the Title of a Pretty Creature:
And doth (or may) retaine as good a mind
As Greater men, and be as well inclin'd:
Hee may be great in spir't, though small in sight,
Whilst all his best of service, is Delight.
The Old'st, your Subject is; but for my use,
I make him here, the Subject of my Muse:
And as his Aged Person gain'd the grace,
That where his Soveraign was, to be in place,
And kisse your Royall Hand; I humbly crave,
His Lives Discription may Acceptance have.
And as your Majesty hath oft before
Look'd on my Poems; Pray reade this one more.
Your Majesties most Humble Subject and Servant,
