MY VVorshipfull deare friends, in the Christi∣an dutie which I owe vnto your worshipfull Parents, who haue a long
 time deserued much at mine hands (and much more then I can repay) as also in the loue J beare to your owne and your beloued yokfel∣low, bethinking with my selfe wherein to shew some token of this loue, (as it well becommeth and concerneth a thankefull heart) and weighing the estate, where∣unto God hath called you, of the marriage band, J did light vpon this argument, thinking it the fittest for your vse, and the easiest for my studie to labour in, by
 reason of mine experience of the euils thereof: which, as a token of my loue, to pre∣uent the euill, and to in∣struct vnto the godly du∣ties and fruits of that Chri∣stian and honourable estate, J doe humbly present, and prefer vnto you: not doub∣ting but you will both accept and apply it, as shall be most expedient in euery respect. And so to a slender worke, a short and briefe Dedica∣tion may well suffice, that the porch of the house be not bigger then the whole buil∣ding.
 And so I commend it to Gods glorie, and my self to your seruice in the Lord Iesus.
