With liberall arm.



FAr bee The Title of this tragik page
From Thee (rare Module of Her√∂ik mindes)
Whose noble Bounty all the Muses bindes
To honour Thee; but mine doth most engage:
And yet, to Thee, and to Thy Patronage
(For present lack of other gratefull signes)
Needs must I Offer these DECAY ed lines
(Lyned with Horrors of ISAACIAN rage):
Whear-in, to keep decorum with my Theam,
And with my Fortunes (ruin'd euery-way)
My Care-clogd Muse (still caried down the stream)
In singing Other's, sighes her Own DECAY
In stile, in state, in hap, in hope, in all:
For, Vines, vnpropped, on the ground do craul.
