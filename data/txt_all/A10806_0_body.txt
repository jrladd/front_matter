RIght worshipfull, amongst the fa∣mous Romaines, Grecians, and o∣thers of most fame in auncient times, theyr custome was when a∣ny dyed of worth, to frame eloquēt Oracions in the deceaseds iust cō∣mendation: which was vttered by some of great skill. (Accordingly) this little Ile doth hold the like zeale to their fauoured. The considera∣tion of which, (right worshipfull) made me long ex∣pect some thing of your honourable deceassed Fa∣ther, to be by some of learning published, in com∣memoration of him, and his zeale to Armes, Iustice, and learning. But seeing none so forward as my self, I haue at last thus boldly aduentured, in naked bare truth, wanting eloquent phrases, to beautifie his deedes of loue to his Country, and zeale to his poste∣ritie, written these lines, and humbly offer them vn∣to your worship, hoping your curteous nature wyll accept this Mite at the hands of a rusticke welwyller, as if Alexander had offered a whole Talent.
