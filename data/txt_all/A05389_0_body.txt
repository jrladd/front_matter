SIth that your honour is full bent,
(right honorable lord)
To vvisdoÌ„ & to godlines
vvith true faithful accord


Sith that in deed you do delyte,
in learning and in skyll:
The shovv vvherof doth vvell expresse
a perfect godly vvyll.


Sith that also you haue in hand,
affayres of force and vvaight:
And study do both day and night,
to set all thinges full straight.



I thought therfore your honour should
not lacke some godly game:
VVhereby you might at vacant times
your self to pastyme frame.


VVhereby I say you might release,
such trauailes from your mynde:
And in the meane vvhile honest mirth
and prudent pastyme fynde.


Remembring then this auncient play,
vvhere vvisdome doth abound:
Called the Philosophers game,
me thinkth I haue one found.


VVhich may your honour recreate,
to read and exercise:
And vvhich to you I here submit,
in rude and homly vvise.


Pithagoras did first inuent,
this play as it is thought:
And therby after studies great,
his recreation sought.



Yea therby he vvould vvell refreshe,
his studious vvery braine:
And still in knovvledge further vvade
and plye it to his gaine.


Accompting that a vvicked play,
vvherin a man leudely:
Mispendes his tyme & vvit also,
and no good getts thereby.


But greuously offendes the Lord,
and so in steed of rest:
VVith trouble and vexation great,
on euery side is prest.


Most games and playes abused are,
and fevve do novv remaine:
In good and godly order as,
they ought to be certaine.


For vvhy? all games should recreat,
the heuy mynde of man:
And eke the body ouerlayde:
vvith cares and troubles than.



But novv in stead of pleasant mirth,
great passions do arise:
In stead of recreation novv,
reuengings vve practise.


In stead of loue and amitie,
long discords do appeare:
In stead of trueth and quietnes,
great othes and lyes vve heare.


In stead of frendship, falshode novv,
mixed vvith cruell hate:
VVe finde to be in playes & games,
vvhich dayly cause debate.


Pithagoras therfore I saye,
to make redresse herein:
Inuented first this godly game,
therby to flye from sinne.


Since vvhich time it continued hath,
in Frenche & Latin eke:
Still exercisde vvith learned men,
their comforts so to seeke.



VVherby vvithout a further profe,
all men may be right sure:
That this game vnto grauitie,
and vvisdome doth allure.


Els vvould not that Philosopher,
Pithagoras so vvyse:
Haue laboured vvith diligence,
this pastime to deuyse.


Els vvould not so vvell learned men,
haue amplified the same:
From tyme to tyme vvith trauell great,
to bring it into fame.


But let vs nerer novv proceed,
and come vvee to theffect:
And then shall vve assuredly,
this pastime not neglect.


For it vvith pleasure doth assvvage,
the heauy troubled hart:
And vvith lyke comforts driues avvay,
all kynde of sourging smart.



The mynde it maketh circumspect,
and heedfull for to bee:
The tyme that theron is bestovvd,
is not in vaine trulye.


The body it doth styrre and moue,
to lightsomnes and ioye:
The sences and the povvers all,
it no vvyse doth annoye.


It practiseth Arithmeticke,
and vse of number shovvth:
As he that is conning therein,
assuredly vvell knovvth.


In Geometrie it truly vvades,
and therein hath to do:
A learned play it is doutlesse,
none can say nay thereto.


Proportion also musicall,
it ioynes vvith thother tvvayne:
So that therin three noble artes,
are exercisde certayne.



VVhat game therfore lyke vnto this,
may gotten be or had?
There is not one that I do knovv,
the rest are all to bad.


It causeth no contention this,
nor no debate at all,
By this no hatred vvrath nor guyle,
in any vvise doth fall.


It stirreth not such troubles that,
our frend becomes our foe:
It moueth not to mischiefe this,
as many others do.


Let vs auoyde the vvorst therfore,
and cleue vve to the best.
So shall vve shunne all vvickednes,
and purchase quiet rest.


So shall vve serue the liuing Lorde,
and vvalke after his vvill:
So shall vve do the thing is good,
and flye that vvhich is yll.



So shall vve liue right christianlyke,
and do our duties vvell:
So shall vve please both god & prince,
none shall vs need compell.


And then the Lord of his mercie,
vvill prosper vs alvvayes:
And graunt vs here to haue on earth,
full many godly dayes.


Yea then the Lord of his goodnes,
and grace celestiall:
VVill guyde and gouerne our affaires,
and blesse our doings all.


VVhich Lord graunt to your honour here,
good dayes & long to haue:
vvith much encrease of helth & vvelth
and from all hurt you saue.
