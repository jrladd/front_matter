SIR,
PErceiving in you a singu∣lar ingenuity in penetra∣ting into the Arcana's of nature, and a cheerful forwardness in a chari∣table improvement of the utmost of your experience in doing good to man∣kind, especially to the despised poor,

who cannot come with price in their hands, I esteemed it as a service well pleasing to God, and most acceptable to man, to be instrumental in adding some∣what to that experience of yours, and of those of like publick spirit with your self, thereby enabling you to be yet more serviceable to this your generation: I therefore here present you with a rich Cabinet of natures unvaluable Jew∣els; But know, that it hath many doors, the one whereof as being shut to many, but not to all, I have opened with an English key; the other must be entred by a penetrating judgement quickened with Celestial lightening. Now where there are publick spirits, profound Me∣diations and a constant industry, Di∣vine illumination is at the door. The

large and boundless secrets of Nature will not attend private interests, nor the deep mysteries of Nature be fathomed by shallow apprehensions, no nor her fair daughters be courted by inconstant servants. But you are otherwise qualified then to despaire of see∣ing her self in her own colours: She unvailes her self to those only that will admire her beauty, and not to those that will cast dirt in her face, being alto∣gether unable to judge of her features.
This Philosophical Treatise being fre∣quently & profoundly read may be un∣derstood, and being understood by you wil qualifie you with such capacities, that you may be able to make not only all the poor in your country rich, but al the sick healthy, and thereby bring to your

self as much honor as mortality need care for. Accept of these my endeavours as proceeding from a sensibleness of your unfeigned love, and respects to him who is
Sir,
