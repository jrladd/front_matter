ALthough (right worshipfull) my longer
silence mighte iustly indite me either of
ingratitude, or forgetfulnes, in Sene∣caes
censure the greater of the two; yet
I not great in fortunes grace, younge in
yeares and not ripe in experience, vvas
fully resolued to trauerse the indictmēt,
vntill more store of wealth, graver age,
& greater practise, might warrant mē
to performe that indeed which now I can but promise in conceipte.
And in that resolution, considering the vndigested method was fi
meate for foule-mouthed Momus, and the Rhetoricall dogge, I
determined to make an hericke of this illiterate pāphlet, & com∣mit
it to the fire; but yet respecting the goodnesse of the argument,
the greatnes of your vertues, and many thanke-worthy benefites
bestowed both by your selfe, and your right worshipfull husbande I
fell from this faint determination to a second and more sound reso∣lution,
Phaeton-like to carry Atlas his burden, and rather to ha∣zarde
a faulte in manners then incurre a blemish in nature, ra∣ther
(by beeing to bolde) to make you the patrones of so simple a
worke, then by silence to seeme vnthankfull. And albeit in per∣forming
heereof I shall rather wronge my selfe in bewraying mine
owne weakenesse, then righte your worshippe in yeelding a fit worke
unswerable to your vvorth; yet my heartes hope is, that as

he christall stone illustrated by the glorious beames doth render
ome (though meane) reflex of the suns immensitie: so my selfe (ex∣osed
to your benefites) may heereby make some (though small) re∣urne
of your vndeserved bounty. And although the treatise
eeme harsh and may dislike you because it came not from Pernas∣us
mountaine; yet I doubt not but you will nourish it for the hill
Syons sake (a speciall obiect of your godly minde) from whence by
nduction it is derived. The method I confesse is the more absurde
by reason it was ordered without advice since my comming into the
country where as the Persians vsed to whittle little stickes to keep
themselues from idlenesse; so my selfe to banish sloath, haue at idle
howers bsied my head and hand, to whittle out this simple exer∣cise:
nothing doubting but that time will one day furnish mee with
opportunitie and practise with sufficiencie to pen a more perfect vo∣lume
worthier your vertuous view. And hoping in the meane time
that you (Penelope like in the absence of your Vlysses) will allow
of this, vouchsafe the reading, and accept in kindenes what I offer
in duety, I leaue your worshippe to the ancient of daies, to prolonge
your life in all happines.
