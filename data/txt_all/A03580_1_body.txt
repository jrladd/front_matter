AFter that I had penned (Right ho∣norable) the vse of the Crosse staffe, I was desired by mine acquain∣tance, to take the paines in the Ia∣cobs staffe. I did so: my paines were liked and called (as the former) vnto the presse. Without a Patrone I would not haue it come forth, be∣cause I would not be thought to bee without a Patrone. To rrouble one man with them both, I thought it not good, least I should seeme forgetfull of other my well-willers: among whom your good will, shewed vnto me at diuerse times, hath emboldened me to craue your pa∣tronage for the thing, which if it shall please your Ho∣nour to vndertake, I shall accompt it as a speciall token of your louing fauour, and acknowledge myselfe in re∣compence, bound to pray for your Honours daily en∣crease in all kindes of blessings.
