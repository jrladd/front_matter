My Lords and Honourable Gentlemen,
TIs not any fond Conceit (bred and encouraged from your accep∣tance of this Discourse) that hath made me entitle the Re∣spect of it to so Honourable and numerous a Partage. The publick Address of it (had I esteemed my self wholly free) must have directed it self (the du∣ty of a Chaplain obliging me) onely to Master Sheriff; whose noble and prudent Deportment in the face of his Countrey, cannot but justifie as well as challenge a property of Homage from others, besides his known Dependents. But as by
Master Sheriffs command (the onely Person, I think, that could have set me that task) I became (at first) engaged to the Pulpit; so can I not think my self acquitted from that obligation, by preach∣ing a maim'd Sermon to so Reverend and Judi∣cious an Auditory.
We read of Mephibosheth, that When ti∣dings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, that his Nurse took him up,2 Sam. 4.4. and making haste to flee, he fell, and became lame. The like misfortune (a truth which every one then ob∣served not) happened unto this Discourse, by the haste I made upon strict commands to shorten your trouble, (though the tongues of Gainsayers may (sometimes) as hastily be fled from, as the swords of Philistines) this Discourse became lame; and I knew no better remedy for its halting, (at least no other satisfaction of Master Sheriffs last In∣junction) than to present it to my Honourable and Learned Auditors upon its legs: which, if not so clean and becoming as Orators may ex∣pect, nor so firm and sinewed as Divines may require; yet may they be fit enough to go of an errand of Charity to my Christian Brethren, and to bring home your pardon for this (but) ne∣cessary piece of boldness in,
My Lords and Honourable Gentlemen,
