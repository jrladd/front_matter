VVHo reads thy Book with an imâˆ£partial Eye,
Will see how plain, and how ingeniously
Thy Rules are fram'd; here every Child may learn
Arithmetick, which doth the Truth discern.
The Judges of our Realm could not dispence
To all Men Justice, were't not fetch'd from hence:
Those Sons of Mars that furrow Neptune's Brow,
Unto this Science must their Labours bow:
The wealthy Merchant, and all Traders, hence
Must calculate their Gain, or their Expence:
The greedy Miser, here may plainly see
His Pelf's increase at Compound Vsurie:
The Purchaser of Farms, may also here,
Value his Lordships, whether cheap or deer.
Thy Squares and Cubes, methinks, so plain do seem,
That I old Euclid should thy Father deem.
All Humane Arts, Mechanical and Free,
For this Companion are oblig'd to Thee.
By Lines and Numbers, we our Buildings bring
In due proportion, framing every thing.
By these our Wooden Walls and Towers are fram'd,
Which guard our Island, and the Seas command:

These fill our Stores with rich and costly things,
Born from both Indies under Canvas Wings:
These fortifie our Towns with Forts, by Line;
By these we learn our Foes to undermine:
By these th' Excise and Customs we do scan,
Without Injustice to the Trading Man.
Thanks to our Author then, that hath set forth
These Arts so plain, and of abundant worth:
Which do to Sea and Land such Profit yield,
In Court, in City, Garrison, and Field.
