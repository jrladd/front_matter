My LORD,
HAD this Sermon been de∣signed to be publick, I would have endeavoured, that it should better have answered both the Dignity of the Subject, and the Nobleness of the Name prefixed to it. But since your Lordship was pleased to encourage the Printing it, as it was Preached;
I esteem that Favour solely to proceed from your Great Piety to Catholick Ve∣rities, (particularly the Honour of our Saviour, at this time so injuriously as∣saulted) and your Love to the Church of England, which ever was, and con∣tinues to be, the best Defender and Conserver of them.
That God will confirm to your Lord∣ship these and all other Virtues, which make true Greatness, and reward them with spiritual and temporal Blessings, is the Prayer of,
My Lord,
