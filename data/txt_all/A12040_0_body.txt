THE Loue I dedicate to your Lordship is without end: wher∣of this Pamphlet without be∣ginning is but a superfluous Moity. The warrant I haue of your Honourable disposition, not the worth of my vntutord lines makes it assured of acceptance. What I haue done is yours, what I haue to doe is yours, being part in all I haue, deuoted yours. Were my worth greater, my duty should shew greater, meane time, as it is, it is bound to your Lord∣ship; To whom I wish long life still lengthned with all happinesse.
