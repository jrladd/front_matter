Dread Soveraign,
WHen the Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy (the greatest Tyes and Obligations that can be imposed upon the Generations of Man∣kind) have so little prevailed, as that the giddy and mad-headed Multitude, prone to all wicked∣ness, and evil Examples, have un∣der an Hypocritical pretence of Holiness; and Reformation of that which was good, and needed it not, introduced an abundance of unclean Spi∣rits, and brought forth that which was altogether like their Tutors and Masters of Impiety, and with great im∣pudence, pertinacity, secret and subtil contrivances after His late Majesties happy Restauration, continued their Machinations and Rebellious Principles until his Death, who notwithstanding his great Clemency, and many Plots discovered by Gods mercy, by the continual vi∣gilancy of his Guards with all the care that could be taken, was for a long time hardly preserved from As∣sassination, which Villanies and Dangers consorted so well with their Ambitions, and Envies, Rapines, Plun∣derings, Sequestrations, Decimations, and pillaging of three Kingdoms, especially of England, besides the sad accompt to be made of the Massacre in Ireland, de∣struction of many Thousands in England with their Fa∣milies

and Estates, in the defence of your Majesties blessed Father the Martyr, with that horrid, & ever to be abhor∣red Addition of his Murther, and the long continued Mi∣series, Calamities and Troubles, put upon their Late Sove∣raign your Royal Brother, & your Majesty, and the rest of the Royal rogeny, as they, or too many of them, or their Seditious and Rebellious Party, may not improbably an thought only to watch or enforce an opportunity of playing the same, or a worse game of Rebellion over again, and if they can, to a more impious advantage, bed plant a soveraignty inherent in the people, whom they intend to govern as arbitrarily and wickedly as they had done before, which a lamentable many years Experience hath taught the people to believe it to be abundantly Tyrannical and Slavish enough to those that were made so unhappy as to endure and Experiment it, which to prevent, is, and should be certainly the duty of e∣very good Subject and I over of his King and Countrey.
In order wherunto, having made my Observations and Remarks, from the Commencement of the grandest Rebellion that ever troubled and harassed England, in the years 1640, 1641. until his present year of the Lord 1685, now the 83 year and an half of my yet (Deo gratias) vividae senectutis, many years before for the most part written, and as well digested as many distur∣bances, and worldly troubles would permit, which could notwithstanding never alienate or withdraw my mind from those my first Enquiries or Observations; And my careful, and I hope, industrious and impartial Recherches into the Original and true power of Parliaments, will shew how the Incroachments of a miselected House of Com∣mons therein, have since the Raigns of Qu. Elizabeth and K. James, made it their principal and only business by Pe∣tions, Ingrateful Lurches, and Artifices and catching Ad∣vantages of our Kings & Princes, necessarily enforced want of Money, for the defence of themselves and their People, to undermine and bring into an Anarchy, or Insulting Poliarchy, this your heretofore more flourishing Mo∣narchy, strongly built and founded upon the Feudal Laws, derived unto your Majesty by and from your Royal Ancestors and Predecessors, from the Brittish, German, Saxon, Danish and Normans Feudal Laws and Customs, the best Establishers and Supports of a

truly (not counterfeit) Monarchick Regal Govern∣ment, and doubt not but that my Labours and Travel therein, with what other Light and Confirmations may be justly added by such as will well Weigh and Con∣sider it, may truly Manifest and Prove the same, and without the suspicion of an over-credulity, well be∣lieve that the Reverend Judges and Sages of the Law (whom our Kings have Commanded and Ordained to be greatly reverenced, administring Justice under you to your people, many of whom, and the professors of the Law, pleading before them, were only Educated, and practised as Lawyers in the time of the late misguided Parliament,) might have been easily mis-led by the Minores Gentium, the Lawyers and Officers pleading or practising in the Courts of Justice, by rejecting the Councel of the Prophet Jeremiah, Stare super vias Antiquas & inquirere Ve∣ritatem, which his lamentations after their destruction, might have taught them after sooner to have believed, and not to have the original of your Majesties Govern∣ment, to be as Inscrutable as that of the River Nile, or to forget their Common Parent or Original, as in many things to make or render our Laws to have no Resemblance thereof, but to be quite contrary thereunto, or as some Children, in the Stories or Tales of easily believing old Women changed in their Cradles; all which should put every good Subject in mind neither to be ignorant of your Rights, or negligent in the main∣tenance of them, it being of no small concernment to your People, to preserve yours with as much care as their own, being comprehended therein, and when he shall hear the Ship wherein his King is, strugling with the rage and fury of the Winds and Seas, and every mi∣nute like to be destroyed and swallowed up, ought to make hast tenui sua Cymba, and do all he can to relieve and preserve him, of what Judgment and Disposition soever he be, though not at all under those great obligations, of the Oaths of Allegeance and Supre∣macy, and of the bonds of gratitude, must exuere humanitatem, that will not endeavour to rescue him, and in these my feeble, but true hearted endeavours, found those that instead of saving the Ship, were only careful to Sacrifice to their own designs, and di∣vert and steer her from the right Port of Monarchy,

whilst they laboured all they could to save her by bring∣ing her only into the Curses rather than Blessings of an Anarchy or knavish self-enriching Poliarchy, and ruine all those that really and heartily wishout any other ends than that of duty and endless Loyalty, came to help her; and not by so many Plots and Conspacies against your Government and Monarchy, and the lives of your Majesty and Royal Brother, give a far greater dis∣turbance thereunto than the unhappy severely punish∣ed Corah, Dathan, and Abiram did to the Government of Moses and Aaron, who did but only murmure against them, saying, Ye do take too much upon you, but did not plot or contrive Treasons, Conspiracies or Rebelli∣ons against, or to Assassinate or Murder them; From all which disturbances and troubles, that God will be plea∣sed whilst you are on Earth, enjoying a happy life amongst an unquiet (as unto too many of them) never to be contented people to free your Majesty, your Heirs and Successors shall (as it hath ever been) be the prayers of
