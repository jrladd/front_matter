May it please your Grace,
'TIS not that I af∣fect the Patronage of great Persons, that this Philosophical piece of Devotion is now com∣mended to Yours, but be∣cause I thought none

so fit as your Grace to Patronize a performance that so well agrees both to the Character of your Person, and to the Stati∣on whereby you stand related to us.
Reason and Religion, which make every Page in this Volume, as they are the two greatest Per∣fections of Human Na∣ture, so do they both conspire in your Graces Person, and that to such a degree as would too

much employ our won∣der, were they not both so Hereditary to your Noble Blood, as to seem rather entailed upon you by descent, than to be of your own acquiring.
But, besides your own Personal Eminency in these two Noble Qua∣lifications of Mind, your Grace has already under∣taken to be their Patron and Protector. Reason and Religion may very fitly be inscribed as a

Motto upon the Gates of our Vniversity; and every one of our Col∣leges is a School of Pie∣ty, as well as of Philoso∣phy. The accomplish∣ment of our Intellectu∣als and Morals, is the peculiar designation of this Place, and our pro∣per and almost only business in it. And in pursuance of this end, your Grace has  lately pleased to  the honour, and yo self the trouble of being

our Chancellor. I could not therefore but pre∣sume, that a Person by disposition of Mind so much a lover, and by place so much concern∣ed, to be a Protector of Learning and Piety, would be easily inclined to countenance a per∣formance, whose direct aim is the promotion of both. And now that your Grace may receive as much Benefit from the perusal of these Me∣ditations, as they will re∣ceive

honour and repu∣tation from your Graces Favour and Protection, is all that is further desired
