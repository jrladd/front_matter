SIR;
SUch as have the happiness to know
you, need no more then the mention
of your Name, to put them in mind
of your merit upon man-kind; whose
learned, industrious and pious ac∣complishments,
have, as with the
greatest modesty and civility, so with
the least austerity or reproach, given the Nobility, Gen∣try,
(yea and Clergy too) of these three Kingdomes
at once to see in your studious and vertuous example,
the best way of proportioning their lives and manners
to the eminency of their Names and Stations; thereby
to preserve or redeem themselves from that Civil war
and sad captivity to which idleness, fermented by inordi∣nate
passions, or vain and vicious affections, is prone
to expose not only their estates, healths and honours,
but their religion, consciences and soules, while men of
Noble birth, good breeding, ingenious parts and generous
estates, do miserably debauch their Dignity, and squan∣der

away those noble advantages they have above other
men, to do well and worthily. As if one should cut
out goodly Timber-trees into Loggs or Chips; and in∣stead
of stately Pillars or Beams, make only Bed-staves,
or Cat-sticks, or Tooth-picks of them. So degenerating
from all true sense of honour becoming Gentlemen
and Christians, as to glory in their shame (I mean
their sin and folly;) and to be ashamed of their true
glory, which is, to be as rationall and religious as they
can be in this state of mortality.
Your Nobleness will excuse me, if I venture to of∣fend
you, by telling the world (what I have many
years longed to do) how high a value I have for you,
of whom I have so pleasing and complete a prospect;
not more for your rare endowments of Nature and Art,
then for your rarer Ornaments of Grace and Vertue;
while you neither superciliously fancy Learning to be
any diminution to your Noble Birth, nor yet Piety to
be any disparagement to your great Learning. I must
not (now) in my maturer years compare you to our so
famous Sir Philip Sidney (whom I heretofore valued
very much, nor do I yet undervalue him) because I
think you have out-vied his Eloquent Valour and Heroick
Romances, with greater Essayes and more useful At∣chievements
both in Philosophy and Divinity.
The more retired and solid grounds of the first (Phi∣losophy)
you are daily searching and discovering, with
your generous Associates, by accurate and real Experi∣ments;
which are the Anatomies of Nature, and the
Keyes to her Cabinets, opening a Door to the true pro∣spect
as of the causes, so of the virtues, operations and
efficacies of things, and by them to the Creators glory;
which is much eclipsed by that occult, conjectural and

sceptical Philosophy, which is rather imaginary then
real, a parturiency without birth, a meet abortion as to
knowledge; indeed, a kind of Legerdemaine in Lear∣ning,
and Sophistry, rather then Science verified by
Experience.
The fountains also of the second (that is, Divinity)
your selfe have lately cleared, in vindicating by your
Pen the Sacred, yet unaffected style of the Scriptures,
with a most Eloquent and Learned Zeal, against some
mens profane and Atheistical cavils, who are so witti∣ly
wicked, as to disdain even salvation it selfe, in that
plain, but sure way, which the wisdom of God sees fit∣test
for humane capacities: whereas few (I believe) of
those curious Gallants would be so foolishly morose, as
to refuse a faire Estate which were setled upon them
in the ordinary legal way of Deeds, because it is
not conveyed to them in such oratorious Harangues and
flourishes of speech as they most fancy.
I have dedicated this little Piece to your great Name,
because it covets a resemblance to, yea and hath an
emulation of, your candor and humanity toward all per∣sons
that are not wholly profligate in their opinions, or
desperate in their actions. The design of this Tract is
to correspond, as much as I may, with your principles
and genius, who have the happiness to render the se∣verest
vertues amiable, and to confute the grossest Er∣rors
with the gentlest Truths.
I confess both in Religion or Charity, and in reason of
State or Policy, I am not for inflicting at first dash sharp
Penalties on seduced or simple people, meerly upon the
account of their Opinions, (modestly dissenting in
some lesser things from the Religion or Laws esta∣blished;
yet without any rude blaspheming or op∣posing

them as to the main of Faith, Morality and
Civil subjection) until such rational and charitable
means have been used to convince them of their errors,
as may at once discharge those duties of Humanity
and Charity which we owe to all men, specially to
our Country-men and fellow-Christians.
The Cudgel and Sword, Prisons and Banishments,
Plunderings and Sequestrations were the late cruel and
flagellant Methods of our most tyrannous times; which
had nothing of Reason, Law or Religion to support them:
but these are not (in my judgment) either the first or the
fittest means to confute the falsities of mens private opi∣nions,
or to rectifie the obliquities of their inconform but
innocent actions, flowing from them upon the account of
Conscience and plea of Religion. (Although it may be
as just as necessary to repress by legal coercions and penal∣ties
those petulant obstinacies, which do resist all softer
applications, and endanger the publick tranquillity by
giving affronts to settled Religion, or obstructions to the
proceedings of Justice by established Laws.) I am indeed
for (cuncta prius tentanda) those Divine Essayes and
Appeals first, which render men most unexcusable (quid
amplius poteram, what could I have done more, &c.) using
lenitives before lancings, & fomentations before incisions
or amputations, until there be no other remedy; then ri∣gor
and severity to some parts; becomes the greatest
Charity to the whole; where not the scratch of a pet∣ty
opinion, but the gangrene of an obstinate and rebel∣lious
humor forceth the abscission of one part, to pre∣vent
a deadly contagion to others, yea to the whole
Body.
Not that I think it any Religion to have an indifferency
to that true Religion which is once established by pub∣lick

consent and Law, as best and fittest for the Nation;
nor is it any part of Mercy alwayes to suffer publick Ju∣stice
to be baffled by the refractoriness of any persons or
parties. No, I am far from a tame permitting Tares
to be openly scattered by the bold and evil hands of any
men, who seek, as enemies, to choak that good seed of
Religion which is sown by the publick Ministry, and
fenced by legal Authority.
As I would have that Religion only setled in its Do∣ctrinals,
Devotionals, Discipline and Government,
which is by publick consent (according to the word of
God and Catholick prudence) judged to be the best for
Truth, Sanctity, Order & Decency (which, blessed be God,
is in England:) so I would have It (and It only) to en∣joy
all publick countenance and encouragements, by the
injunction and protection of the Laws, by the favour
and example of the Prince, by publick maintenance and
honour, by the use of publick Churches and Oratories: To
the Preachers and professors of this, publick Offices and
Employments of honour and authority, foraign and do∣mestick,
ecclesiastical, civil and military, should be chiefly
appropriated; of these advantages dissenters should be ge∣nerally
deprived, because they are the proper honoraries
of those who most serve the publick Peace, by their due
observance of the Religion and Laws established; from
which whoso openly vaies and dissents, layes the
foundations, as of distraction and division, so of destru∣ction
and confusion.
With these outward advantages added to that inter∣nal
power of truth & holiness which are in the established
Religion, it may (as I think) not only be happily suppo∣ted,
but easily prevaile in a short time (by Gods blessing)
against all factious and feeble oppositions; unless the scan∣dal,

negligence, levity and luxury of its Ministers, Bi∣shops,
Presbyters and Professors overthrow it, by casting
such immoral disgraces upon it as make people dis∣sbelieve
and abhorre both it and them; as was in the
case of Eli's Sons.
But I confesse I would not have this legal and
avowed Religion of the Nation so rigorous, sharp
and severe (as Sarah to Hagar) by the suddain over∣awing
or violent overlaying of all other different
perswasions in peaceable men, as not to let them
breath in the same common Air, or not to enjoy their
lives, civil liberties and estates, with their dissenting
consciences, in all modest privacy and safety: I abhorre
(as much as I dread) all racks and tortures of mens souls,
or those cruel no less then curious scrutinies of mens con∣sciences,
which covet, first (like God) to search mens
hearts, and then (like the Devil) delight to torment
them in their Estates and Liberties, only because they
are not so wise or apprehensive as themselves, but as
honest (perhaps) and sincere in the sight of God.
True; I think that some little pecuniary mulct,
as one or two Shillings to the poor, for every Lords
dayes absence from the publick Church or As∣sembly,
may be justly (laid as a mark of publick dis∣like)
upon Dissenters and Separaters from the establi∣shed
Religion; not for their private difference in judg∣ment,
(which possibly is not their fault) but for their
publick deformity in practise, to the scandal of the
established Religion, and to the endangering of the pub∣lick
welfare, whose strength and stability consist in
unity, and this in uniformity to the setled rule, and in
conformity, to outward practise: yet still no Inquisi∣tion
to be made into free mens Consciences, nor any

great penalty laid upon them for their perswasions,
further then their words and actions do discover their
Principles, Opinions, Correspondencies, and Adheren∣cies
to be contrary and dangerous to the publick Peace,
Order and Justice, which all are founded in, and
flourish by our setled Laws and Religion: Thus
permitting sober men not a declared toleration, or
publick profession, by way of open rivalry to the
established Religion, but only such an arbitrary con∣nivence
and conditional indulgence as gives them
no trouble for their private and untroublesome Opi∣nions,
while they are kept in their breasts and clo∣sets;
or in their private houses and families: to which
all dissenters ought in reason to be confined on the
Lords day, without any convention of strangers to them;
though (perhaps) on the week-day they may have
their meetings allowed, yet so as to be kept within
parochial bounds, or to such a number of persons and
families as shall be thought safe.
But for Dissenters to have multitudinous Conventi∣cles,
as it were musterings of their forces, when, where,
and as many as they please, cannot be safe: for there∣by
they not onely affront the established Religion,
but confirm each other in their opinions; yea and
(as Charcoals in heaps) they more kindle and en∣flame
each, other by their numbers, to such proud ani∣mosities
and rebellious confidences, as may hope to set up
their Faction supream, not only in the repute of Reli∣gion,
but in civil power; which is the ambitious aim of all
parties, (except that which is purely Christian, & wholly
resolved into suffering principles.) All others (we see)
whether Papists, or Presbyterians, or Anabaptists, or
Independents, affect (summam Imperii) as Diotrephes, to

have the preeminence; as Lucifer and Antichrist, to ex∣alt
themselves above all: and therefore they must by
wise and vigilant power, as well as by good preaching
& living, be kept▪ as fire, within the hearth of their pri∣vate
opinions and parties, left they prevaile by popu∣lar
Arts against the publick established Religion, which
is the Palladium or Conservator of civil peace and pro∣sperity,
and never to be rashly changed, or rudely con∣temned
while it is authorised.
The great Charity to which includes even a charity to
all those which differ from its present settlement; who
commonly are more miserable in the riotous mutations
which their folly and rudeness affects, then in those so∣ber
restrictions of which they are so impatient, that
from different perswasions they break out to petulant
oppositions by Tongue and Pen; thence they are betray∣ed
to seditious projects; and at last these must be brought
forth in tumultuary and violent actions; which are so
intolerable, that the very first sparks of their insolent
and seditious Expressions, especially in Pulpits and
Presses, ought by great penalties to be suppressed:
there being nothing more unreasonable, then for any
man rudely to blaspheme and reproach that Religion
which his Prince and Countrey professe; unless he be
so impudent (as many are) to blaspheme that also which
himselfe owneth as the true Religion with them.
This tenderness, moderation and indulgence I bear only
to humble, modest and innocent dissenters, upon the ac∣count
of Christian Charity, which ought in all things,
becoming humanity, to exceed all other men, as Ter∣tullian
well observes.
To which Christian Charity of mine towards sober
dissenters, (besides the confidence I have of Truth

and its prevalency) perhaps my native temper and can∣dor
may contribute something, which abhors, after the
genius of Primitive Christians, all severity or rigors only
upon the score of Religion, farther then is necessary
for the cure of offenders, and the conservation of the pub∣lick
Peace. I know the roughness or smoothness of mens
educations and complexions, like Esaus and acob's, have
much influence upon their opinions and conversati∣ons;
yea, and upon their consciences too. If this may
seem to some too great a facility and gentleness in me,
yet it is an error on the right hand, and nearest the me∣dium
both of humanity as a man, and of charity as a
Christian, measuring all Policies by Christs golden Rule,
To do as I would be done unto.
Secondly, In point of State-Policy also, or methods
of true Government, I do conceive that meer plagiary
counsels and punitive courses are never likely to obtain
the main End, which is to stop the contagion of errors,
and to extirpate those depraved opinions, which are just∣ly
thought to be the spawn of dangerous actions: For,
unless the generality of credulous people, who are specta∣tors
of those that differ and suffer for their opinions and
consciences, do also see so much light of Reason and
clear Religion, as may justifie the severity of the Laws
executed upon those offenders, who profess Conscience
for their Disobedience, and Scripture for their Consci∣ences;
it is most certain, that the spectators of their
sufferings will very much soften to a compassion for
them; and by sympathizing with their persons in afflicti∣on,
they will, by degrees, symbolize with their opinions;
easily running, as metal that is melted, into the same
mold: at length the populacy, if not fortified by preg∣nant
demonstrations of Truth against those spreading

errors and their Pseudo-Martyrs, will mightily cry up
their Piety, admire their Courage, & magnifie their Con∣stancy:
At last they will conclude those sufferers to
have some special support, or diviner Spirit above or∣dinary
men, because they seem to be so much above
the ordinary passions of fear and hope, self-love and pre∣servation;
which prospect of patience Justin Martyr
tells us, was the first occasion of his examining the
Doctrine of Christians, that he might see on what
ground so fixed a constancy grew, which shewed a Di∣vine security midst humane infirmity.
By such popular pity and applause, not only sufferers
will be confirmed in their pertinacy, but their spectators
also will dayly encrease and multiply, as the shootes of
Trees do by the lopping off their branches: especially
if the lives and actions of such dissenters and sufferers
be morally just and civilly innocent. For nothing soo∣ner
discovers and blasts such cross opinions, and withers
the glory of their factious spectators, then vile, injuri∣ous
and insolent demeanor either in words or deeds;
such as all men confess to deserve the Gaole and Gib∣bet.
This indeed (as in the mad pranks of John of
Leyden and his Anabaptistick crew in Germany, and so
in our Hacket and other Disciplinarians in England;
in the late presumption of the Presbyterian Reformati∣ons,
and Independent Confusions, full of Perjury, Sacri∣ldge,
Treason and innocent Blood) This, I say, will,
as the barking of Trees round, presently bring any Opi∣nionists
and Factionists to publick scorn and hatred;
as it did those Papists who heretofore in the Marian
Persecutions, in the horrid Powder-Plot, and in the late
Irish Rebellion, full of perfidy and cruelty, have so ble∣mished
the repute of that Catholick cause, as it can

never be redeemed from just jealousies, but by acti∣ons
of extraordinary Loyalty, Meekness and Huma∣nity;
besides the renouncing of some opinions.
But where harmlesness of life sets a glosse on Opi∣niont,
and Errors thereby grow more lusty and rank,
(as ill weeds in good ground:) there meer robust power
or punitive severity can no more pull them up, then a
strong arm doth thorns and bushes when they are deeply
rooted; breaking off the stem or top of them, but
leaving the roots still in the ground, which will spring
again, and spread farther. Here nothing is so effe∣ctual
to do execution upon errors, as clear demon∣strations of Reason and Religion; which reaching
mens Consciences, by the proper methods of conviction,
do, like a sharp Spade and Mattock, fetch up the very
roots and fibres of evil opinions, to the utter extir∣pation
of such noxious plants in a short time, ex∣cept
where knavery and hypocrisie do husband Opi∣nions
to the best advantage of secular ends and in∣terests
of reputation, profit or power.
After this charitable method and temper were those
many learned Works and elaborate Tracts of the An∣cient
Fathers of the Church, Irenaeus, Tertullian,
Cyprian, Saint Austin, Prosper, Cyril, Hilary, Opta∣tus,
Saint Jerom and others, written, conforme to
the Canons and Decrees of Ecclesiastical Councils,
guided by the Word and Spirit of God; and sea∣sonably
applied by their skilful and charitable hands,
to cure the maladies and stop the Gangrenes of such
pestilent opinions as sprang up in their dayes from
Hereticks, Schismaticks and Fanaticks. Nor did those
holy men at any time so despise the meannesse of any
Christians outward condition, or the fatuity of their

opinions, as not to set a great value on their souls,
for which Christ had died; ever applying, first the
sword of the Spirit, the Word of Truth, in meekness
of wisedom, before they craved the assistance, or
incouraged the severity of the secular Sword, from
Christian Emperours and Magistrates; using all ra∣tional
and religious means, untill they found, that
depraved opinions put men upon desperate actions,
as in those of the Novatians, Donatists and Arrians,
also of the Manichees, Euchites and Circumcellians,
(a primitive kind of Quakers) who by a specious
constancy in praying, and affectation of suffering, so
seduced the vulgar people, that the numbers of their
devout, idle and hungry associates, at length, gave them
confidence to make a prey and spoile of other mens
goods, estates and lives too; till by armed Forces
they were repressed, and by just Laws prohibited, in
Honorius and other Emperors times.
Then indeed Charity to the publick peace and
welfare must be preferred before any pity, charity, for∣bearance
or indulgence to private persons, parties and
opinions, which growing rude and insolent in their
words or deeds, sufficiently discover they are not up∣on
the pure account of Conscience, or principles of
true Christian Religion; which is as farre as Hea∣ven
from Hell, or Christ from Belial, from teach∣ing
or impelling men to any actings or approvings
of private sinnes and immoralities, much more from
publick conspirings and practisings of Factions, Schisms,
Sedition and Rebellion in Churches and Kingdomes:
for which Christ never gave any Commission to his
Disciples, nor the least countenance; but on the
contrary, most eminent precepts and examples of

humility, meekness and patience under any sufferings
for conscience sake; sufficient for ever to confute
the most specious pretensions of any, who violently
carry on their private Opinions and pretended Re∣formations,
against the will and power of lawful Ma∣gistrates
and settled Churches.
I do judge it both Piety, Charity and Policy, to
establish the rule of publick Religion by Lwes for
uniformity in Doctrine, Devotion, Discipline and
Decency, accompanied, as with Rewards and Privi∣ledges
to the Conformers, so with some mode∣rate
pecuniary Penalties on Dissenters, according to
mens estates and influences: but, I confess, I am
not for heavy mulcts, and rigorous exactions, which
shal imprison, banish, impoverish or destroy modest Dissen∣ters
and their families onely for the variety of their
judgment; when their civil actions are otherwise moral,
just and inoffensive. This severity would in some Coun∣tries
(and possibly now in England) be not only de∣structive
to many thousands, but very disadvantagi∣ous
to the King and Kingdome, to the Trade and
Commerce of the Nation, by opening a little Wic∣ket
of Royal Clemency only to some few, and shutting
the great Gate to many, whose tender and unsatis∣fied,
or scrupulous Consciences do as much expect,
need and deserve it, as those that have it in pet∣ty
matters; while all others scruples are driven to
discontent and despair by denial of all▪ indulgence
to them in greater scruples.
There are but these four wayes of treating any
party that dissents from the publick establishment
of Religion and its Lawes in any Church and King∣dom.
1. Either to impoverish, imprison, banish and

destroy all Dissenters, as the King of Castile did the
Moores of Granada; which is a very rough, barba∣rous,
unwelcome and unchristian way, disallowed by
all wise men of all perswasions: Or, Secondly, by ra∣tional
convincing them of their errors; which is a
work of time and dexterity, not to be done on the
sudden, no more then bodily cures, without a mira∣cle;
though very worthy to bear a part in the Dis∣cipline
of the Church, which should require of every
one a reason why they differ from, or forsake the
established Religion, and treat them according as
their perswasion, passion, or pertinacy shall appeare
to the Conservators of Religion: Or, Thirdly, by
changing established Laws for their sake; which is
not for the Piety, Prudence, Honour and Safety of
a Nation and Church, when it judgeth its Con∣stitutions
to be religious, righteous and convenient:
Or, Fourthly, by way of discreet connivance and
charitable indulgence, so farre as the civil peace
of the Nation will bear; until Reason and Religi∣on
(of whose prevalency wise and good men never
despair) have by calme and charitable methods re∣covered
people from the error of their wayes, by
the sacred Doctrine and good examples of those
who conforme to the established Lawes in Church
and State. This being first done, will render Dis∣senters
unexcusable, and justifie any severity which
shall be inflicted upon the extravagancies of those
opinions and actions which do any way perturb the
publick peace, or affront the established Religion.
And in this particular case of the Quakers (who
refuse all legal Oathes, upon scruples of Conscience,
and so threaten either to subvert our Laws, or to ob∣struct

all judicial proceedings, pleading for their dis∣obedience
to mans Laws, the express command of
Christ and his Apostle Saint James) no sober man
can think by meer penalties to reduce them to a con∣formity
with our Laws, or to stop the spreading of their
Opinions, untill it be plainly shewed, that it is not
true Religion, but onely Superstition in them; a fear
where no fear is; a being righteous over-much, by a
mistake of Christs meaning; a wresting of those Scrip∣tures,
by their own unlearnedness and unstableness, to
their own destruction, as well as to the publick per∣turbation.
Noble Sir, this great work (for so it is, to convince
weak and wilful men of the error of their wayes) I
have undertaken in this little Treatise, by Gods bles∣sing,
not unseasonably (I hope) as to our times, nor
unsuitably, as to my profession. If I may be happy to do
any of them good (who possibly may erre in this with
no evil mind) by redeeming them from their mistakes,
and so from the penalties of the Law, I shall more re∣joyce
in that success, then those Souldiers did, who
among the Ancients were rewarded with Civick Gar∣lands
for preserving any of their Countrey-men and
fellow-Citizens: which Honour (you know) the Roman
valour esteemed more, then any victorious Laurels for
destroying their Enemies. And in this charitable en∣deavour
(prospered by Gods grace) I shall the more se∣riously
triumph, because I believe it most agreable
as to my Saviours preoept and primitive examples of
Christian Bishops, so to your generous Soule, whereby
this piece may probably be fortified with the approba∣tion
of so pieus and judicious a person; whose single suf∣frage

is to me more valuable then the sequacious and
vulgar votes of thousands, whose empty brains and
clamorous mouths, like hollow places where Echo hides
her self, do commonly receive and report things, not
as the Truth is in them, but as the noise and cry is low∣dest.
I know you are as much above plebeian censures,
as titular Honours, traditional Philosophy, and popular
Religion; being every way judiciously devoted to God
and his Truth, full of Loyalty to the King and Laws,
also of sober Conformity to the established Religion of
this Church, whose royal Law is that of Charity, the
bond of perfection, and centre of Peace: In all which
respects you deserve and have the love and honour of
all worthy Persons, and particularly of him, who may,
without vanity, own this as an instance of some worth
in him, that he is,
(SIR)
