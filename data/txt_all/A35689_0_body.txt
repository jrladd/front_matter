TO be a father to the father∣lesse, is properly the vertue of the most high, and therefore meet for those who beare his name and office upon earth. Among whom (Right Ho∣nourable) seeing it hath pleased his Majesty to count your Lordship faithfull, and to put you in so high a service, it shall (I assure my selfe) be matter of rejoycing unto your Lord∣ship, to take the Patronage of this poore Or∣phane, which knoweth not whither to flye for succour, but to you, who did so many waies commend your favour to his late deceased Father, that if he had lived to the birth of this his last off-spring it was his full purpose (as
 many can witnesse) to have committed it unto your Lordships protection, as most meete among many to take this Patronage upon you, that this young Infant growing up under your roofe, may in time effect that indeed, whereof it beares the name, to be The ruine of Rome, To speake of the excel∣lent parts thereof, and of what hope it is like to be in the Church of Christ, I thinke need∣lesse, and I feare the note of partiality: it shall speake for it selfe, (I doubt) will commend to all posterity his worthy fathers memory. Now for my selfe (right Hono∣rable) being so straightly bound to this du∣ty, in regard of my neere conjunction with my late Brother Master Dent, and great im∣portunity of his poore Widdow, was the more willingly drawne hereunto in two re∣spects. The one to give some publike testi∣mony of my love towards him, and reve∣rence of the rare grace which we all (who injoyed his sweete society) did continually in our comfort behold in him. Whose lear∣ning his labours do shew: whose diligence, yea extreme and unwearied paines in his mi∣nistery publikely, privately, at home, and a∣broade, for foure and twenty yeares at least, all our Countrey can testifie. All which being
 adorned with so speciall humility, do make his name the greater, and our losse the more grievous. I may not leave out this, which I avow to be as certaine, as it is singular, that besides all other his great labours, he had (with the Apostle) a speciall care of all the Churches night and day, by study and fervent Prayer, procuring the prosperity of Syon, and the ruine of Rome. And to end with his blessed end, his life was not more profi∣table to others, then his death is peaceable to himself; scarce a grone to be heard, though his Fever must needes be violent which dis∣patched him in three dayes. And having made a pithy confession of his Faith, this Faith said he, have I Preached, this Faith have I lived in, this Faith I do live in, and this Faith would I have sealed with my blood, if God had so thought it good, and tell my brethren so; and drawing neere his end, he sayd: I have fought the good Fight, I have fi∣nished my course, I have kept the faith: and now is that Crowne of righteousnesse layd up for mee, the which the Lord that righteous Judge shall give me in that day; and so gave up his last breath with these words, I have seene an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exceeding large.

The other respect (my speciall good Lord) for the which I am the more willing to come thus upon the Stage (though my part be small, full sutable to my ability) is, that I might be as the mouth of many, to publish to posterity, what high account all that know the truth (among us at least) do make of your Lordship, that I dare say not the loynes onely, but the soules of thousands do blesse you, and God for you: praying for a rih reward to be given you of the Lord, and that with your ancient predecessor ho∣nourable Nhemiah, the Lord would re∣member you herein, and wipe not out all the kindnesse you have shewed on the house of you God, and on the Ministers thereof. For in the zeale of God, and uprightnesse of my heart, not to give titles unto men (which is not my wont) but to provoke all of like honorable condition to follow your Godly practice: this I say, that as your pure Religi∣on is the Crowne of your nobility, so this is the Crowne of your Religion, that besides your ordinary presence in the publicke assem∣blies of the Church, your zeale to God, and lov to his people, hath herein especially bin manifested to the world, in your continuall cr to plant faithfull Preachers in all those
 livings which have been in your Lordships gift, or which by all your friends you could procure. What is the worthy fruite thereof cannot indeede be valued, much lesse by me now uttered: yet this I say with common consent of all found-hearted Protestants, that if the true Prophets of God be the chariots and horsemen of Israel, then may we refer to this honourable practice of your Lordship, and of other like Christian Patrones (as to a chiefe meanes under God, and under the Re∣ligious regiment of our gracious Soveraigne) the safety of his Highnesse person, this admi∣rable tranquility of the Realme, that notable ruine of Rome, which is so worthily with us effected, and shall be assuredly elsewhere in due time accomplished. And to say all in few words, to this may we referre the safety of soule and body of many thousands in the Land, who though they doe and shall live by faith, yet doth their righteousnesse farre exceed the righteousnesse of all Popish hypocrites both in duty to God, and to their dread Soveraigne our noble King.
Whereupon I may conclude, that I scarce thinke of any service more honourable to God, and profitable to his Church, then this care to bring into the Lords Temple such
 painefull Labourers as both by life and Do∣ctrine do faithfully build up the same. Goe on therefore (Right Honourable) and cease not to shine out in this darke World with such light of good example: And withall rest upon his word, who cannot lye, that you shall shine in the Kingdome of light, where into shall enter no uncleane thing: neyther whatsoever worketh abomination or lies, but they which are written in the Lambs Booke of life. To which blessed inheritance immortall, undefiled, and that fadeth not, that God of his mercy would bring you, my hearts desire and prayer is, and shall be: and in the meane season, that the yeeres of your life being multiplied, your life may be full of honour to God, profit to his Church, and comfort to your owne soule.
