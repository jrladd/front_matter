ALthough I need plead no other Rea∣son
for the publishing of the ensu∣ing
discourse, but your Order and
Command for my so doing, yet be∣cause
I know that your peculiar
Interest, as Governors of this
Common-wealth, in the severall stations wherein
you are placed of God, is truely stated therein, in
the pursuit whereof, your Peace, and the Peace of
these Nations will be found to lye; I crave leave to
adde that consideration also. Being fully acquain∣ted,
in, and with what weaknesse it was composed
and delivered, I cannot but conclude, that it was
meerly for the truths sake therein contained which
is of God, and its suetablenesse through his wise

providence, to the present state of things, in these
Nations, that it found acceptance and entertain∣ment
with you, which also makes me willing to
be therein your Remembrancer a second time.
From the day wherein I received a command and
call unto the service of Preaching unto you, unto
this issue of it, wherein it is cloathed anew with o∣bedience
to your Order, I found mercy with God to
have that caution, of the great Apostle a∣biding
in my heart and thoughts, if I yet please
man, I am not a servant of God; Hence I can with
boldnesse professe, that influenced in some measure
with the power of that direction, I studiously a∣voided
what ever might be suggested, with the
least unsuitablenesse thereunto, with respect either
to my selfe or others.
It was for Sions sake, that I was willing to un∣dertake
this duty, and service: rejoycing that I
had once more an opportunity to give publike Te∣stimony
to the great concernment of the great God,
and our deare Lord Jesus Christ, in all the concus∣sions
of the Nations in the World, and peculiarly
in his wonderfull providentiall dispensations, in
these wherein we live. And here as the summe of
all, touse plainesse and liberty of speech, I say,
If there be any thing, in any person whatever,
in these Nations, that cannot stand with, that
can stand without the generall interest of the
people of God pleaded for, let it fall and rise
no more: And the Lord I know will send his
blessing out of Sion, on what ever in singlenesse of
heart, is done in a tendency to the establishment
thereof.

Farther I shall not need to suggest any thing of
the designe of the ensuing discourse: they who take
themselves to be concern'd therein, will acquaint
themselves with it, by its perusall▪ I shall only adde,
if the generall principles asserted therein be in your
hearts, if in pursuit thereof you endeavour, that in
no corner of this Nation it may be said, this is Si∣on
that no man careth for, but that those who
love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and are by
faith and obedience separated from the perishing
world, following the Lamb, according to the light
which he is graciously pleased to impart unto them
and ingaged by the providence of God, in that
work which he hath undertaken to accomplish a∣mongst
us; be not overborne by a spirit of prophane∣nesse,
and contempt of the power of Godlinesse,
raging in the Earth; that they may be preserv'd
& secured, from the returne of a hand of violence,
and encouraged in the Testimony they have to bear
to the Kingdom of Christ, in opposition to the World
and all the ways which the men thereof have
received by Tradition from their Fathers, that
are not according to his mind, you will undoub∣tedly
in your severall conditions receive blessing
from God; which also that you may in all your
concernments, is the daily prayer of
