May it please your Grace,
IN this Season of Griefs that over∣spreads Three Kingdoms, I thought it not unbecoming me, to add one Voice to the Consort of Mourners.
The Universal Goodness of the Queens Life, is attended with a Sorrow of Equal Compass at her Death. If we Consider the Causes of it, our Sins, the just Incentives of Gods High Displeasure, and the Chain of fearful Consequences that may ensue; What Heart is such a

frozen Fountain as not to Dissolve, and mix flowing Tears with the Current that will be permanent in Times to come.
I have presum'd to inscribe your Most Honourable Name in the following Ser∣mon, knowing that notwithstanding the meanness of the Composure, the Subject of it will be very pleasing to your Grace, as being the Expression of Homage to the Memory of the Incomparable Princess, our Sovereign by a Double Title, by her Resplendent Virtues, and by her Crown. I am
My Lord,
