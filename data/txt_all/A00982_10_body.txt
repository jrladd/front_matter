I Fall the Worthies should on earth appeare,
The ancient Worthies nine in Ranke and place
(Three from Iudaea, three from other where,
And Christians three) our Britaines hopefull Grace,
Our sweet yong Prince, thereby could take smal staine
Though they from graues were raised vp againe.
Now for those Kings, which HENRY had to name,
May they compare with HENRY Britaines Prince?
These Worthies (though of farre renoumed fame)
Haue sought and fought long time agoe, and since,
In vaine for to conioyne their neighbour land
To this their owne; continuing warre and strife,
Vntill it pleas'd Iehouas mighty hand
From hence to giue King IAMES the fourth a wife,
HENRY seuenths, sister, Lady Margaret faire;
Of whom descends our Liege and gracious King,
And braue Prince HENRY, his thrice worthy heire.
Magnifie God and Nature, for this thing.
Which sole succession hath brought such accord,
That he of both may once rest Soueraigne Lord.
This then may make our Worthy principall
Of later nine; His future power and strength:
Yea more, herein exceeding Worthies all;
They being dead are now entumbd at length:
This Worthy liues. God graunt him long to liue:
Graunt long (good Lord) the King, his father, reigne
(And to his princely sonne thy graces giue,
Great God) that both may Britains wealth maintaine.
