To my dearly beloved Friends, The Inhabitants of the City of COVENTRY, Both Magistrates and People; ESPECIALLY Col. John Barker, and Col. Tho. Willoughby, late Governors, with all the Officers, and Souldiers of their Garison. Rich. Baxter Devoteth this Part of this Treatise, in thankful acknowledgment of their great Affection toward him, and ready acceptance of his labors among them (which is the highest recompence, if joyned with obedience, that a faithful Minister can expect.)
