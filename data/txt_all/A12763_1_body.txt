To the worshipful his most louing
vnckle, FR: SA. &c.
MY good Vncle, the
speeches that past
casually betweene
vs at our last par∣ting,
haue runne often since in
my minde; and so (perhaps)
haue they done in yours. You
complained (as God would
haue it) that you were much
crost in the building you were

in hand with, vpon a peece of
gleabe of your Appropriate
Parsonage at Congham. I
answered, that I thought God
was not pleased with it, inso∣much
as it tended to the de∣frauding
of the Church, ad∣ding
(amongst some other
words) that I held it vtterly
vnlawfull to keepe Appro∣priate
Parsonages from
the Church, &c.
But our talke proceeding, I
perceiued that as God had al∣waies
his portion in your hart,
so in this, though it concerned
your profit, you seemed tracta∣ble.

It much reioyced mee, and
therefore apprehending the oc∣casion,
I will be bold to adde a
continuance to that happy mo∣tion:
(so I trust, both you and
I, shall haue cause to terme it)
and besides, to giue you some
tribute of the loue and duty I
long haue ought you. There∣fore
(good vncle) as your
heart hath happily conceiued
these blessed sparks, so in the
name and blessing of God, che∣rish
and enflame them. No
doubt they are kindled from
heauen, like the fire of the Al∣tar,
and are sent vnto you

from God himselfe, to bee a
light to you in your old daies
(when your bodily eies faile
you) to guide your feete into
the way of peace, that is,
the way & place from whence
they came. So alwaies I pray
for you, and rest,
Westmin.
