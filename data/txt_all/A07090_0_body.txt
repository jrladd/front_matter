My noble Lord,
I Should not present, with∣out much Apologie, so

meane a Worke to a hand so ho∣nourable, did not a confidence in your true worth, and the cleare∣nese of mine owne thoughts, give me Encouragement. Therfore with the same modesti that the ingeni∣ous Author of these Epigrams pre∣sented some of them to Plinius Se∣cundus, a noble Roman of happy employment under Traian the Em∣perour (as a recreation onely to his howers of mirth and pleasure) do I offer these my poore Endeavours to your Lordship. With how much courtesie the noble Pliny in one of his Epistles doth acknowledge the respect of Martial, I doe no waies inferre, eyther to direct, or much

lesse to engage your Lordships ac∣ceptation; since I confesse the difference to bee great betweene so acute an Authour, and my selfe the vnworthy Translatour. Onely requesting humbly that you would be pleased in this lit∣tle to accept my true service. Of which (in mine owne iudge∣ment) I cannot make a fitter ten∣der than to such a Lord, to whose knowne Vertues so famous a Vni∣versitie as Cambridge hath yeel∣ded the Protection of her selfe. To which, and to all good lear∣ning, that you may long live a favourable Mecaenas, and (like Mecaenas) graced in the service

of our good, and great Augu∣stus, hee prayeth, that will ever continue
