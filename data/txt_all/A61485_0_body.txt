DVring the time (Dearest Cousin) I had the happinesse for some years, not long since, (through your more then generous goodnesse) to call your house, my Home; I could not but take notice how much you were addicted to History, out of a noble desire of acquaintance with former times: insomuch, that the vast bulk of Mr Fox his Martyrologie, a volume to be Chronicled for its unweildi∣nesse; Sr Walter Ralegh's History of the World; Purchas his Pilgri∣mage, a Book Treating of all the Religions, Lawes, and Customes of eve∣ry Nation under Heaven; together with severall other large and tedious Authors, could not deterre your eager eyes, but into these they would ven∣ter, though as into Groves and Labyrinths (without Ariadne's clew) inextricable; Books that like China dishes, or the walls of Jericho, are begun in one Century, and scarce gone through with, in the next; or as it is in curious and long-breath'd Romances, or Sr Philip Sidney's ingeni∣ously insinuating Meanders, the fancy Travels all day in the paths of expectation, and at night cannot rest on the bed of satisfaction.
In consideration whereof (worthy Cousin) and at present not being able to serve you with other devoire, I thought good to offer something (though but a mite) in order to acknowledgment of your innumerable fa∣vours, (to wit) this Epitome of the Annalls of England, being as it were a glance upon the Reigns of all the Kings, with the two Queens of this Realme, from William the Conquerour, to the twelfth year of the Reigne of his sacred Majesty Charls the Second (God be thanked) now flourish∣ing; together with the exact and lively Portraicture of every King and Queene in Copper Plates: As also, their severall Elegies in twelve ver∣ses, which indeed contein as it were a summary and Compendium of the Epitome; all which (not without much pains) I have drawn within the Circle of your eye, so that at once you may read both Lines and Lineaments, which cannot but be of great advantage to your memory, without which reading is but like a mans beholding his face in a glasse, and turning his back to forget what manner of person he was.
To avoid therefore prolixity, both ingratefull to the Reader, and destru∣ctive

to the Memory, I have perused and compared many vast and volu∣minous Authours, such as were the most authentick and best approved, and out of them have presented you here Truth, as she ought to be, naked; and by leaving behind those various dresses, the Wardrobe of her needlesse ornaments, that her Authors had set her forth with, I shall render her to you, though not so glorious, yet more memorable. In a word, I have here presented you with much in a little, Homers Illiads in a nut-shell; or (if I may say so) the Pater Noster in a penny, Chronicle in Shorthand: you have the Marrow, the Graine, the Kernell, let who will take the bones, the husks, and the shells: There is nothing remarkable, but I touch it so farre as the narrow confine of half a sheet will permit, which is enough to enforme and satisfie concerning truth, and in vaine are many words, where one will suffice; for let the Proverb say what it will, The furthest way about is not the nearest way home: Moreover, this advantage accrues to our concisenesse, That before you can read the circumstantialls of one Kings Life in a volumne, you may here run over the atchievments of them all since the Conquest, and thereof give a landable account.
But least whilst I thus complement with your patience in illustrating the advantages of brevity, I forget my self, and let my so much talkt of Epitome (like that little City) run out at the Gates of my Dedication, I will shut up all, and make this an Oblation to your memory, not your me∣rit, which is so vast and unfathomed it would swell it self into such a vo∣lumne of obliges, that my whole work would scarce look big enough to be∣come an Epistle to it. To summe up all your particular goodnesses and my severall engagements, were to baffle Arithmetick with the Sands, and to lay the first stone of a work of eternity; for I know neither where to begin nor where to end: but as with many, acknowledgment of former favours is a tacit begging of future; so it is with me, while I stalk with one cour∣tesie for another, making my gratitude for what I have, a Preface to what I would have. In plain English, I thank you for your first kindnesse, and betray you to a second, which is, That you would pardon me, in that I have unknown to you presumed to make this Book publick under the honour of your name; hich if you shall vouchsafe, I am all gratitude: and as∣sure your self, when any thing more worthy your judicious view shall is∣sue from our riper Genius, 'tis vow'd to you by
