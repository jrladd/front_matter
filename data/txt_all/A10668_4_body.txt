RIGHT HONOURABLE;
HAving formerly dedicated the third Book of these my Tragicall Histories (of Gods Revenge against Murder) to your In∣comparable Lord and Brother, William Earle of Pembroke (who now lives with God) I therefore held my selfe bound (by the double obligation of my duty and your own generous merits likewise to present this Fourth Booke to your Protection and Patronage, because as England, so Europe perfectly knowes that you are as true an heire to his Vertues, as to his Fortunes▪ and to his Goodnesse, as to his Greatnesse, and that therfore it may properly be said he is not dead, because they (as well as himselfe) do still survive and live in you, with equall lustre and

glory, as having made either a happie Metamorphosis, or a blessed Transmigration into your Noble breast and resoluti∣ons, and therefore as it was my sincere respects and zeale to his Honour that then drew me to that ambition; so it is entirely the same which hath now both invited and induced me to this prsumption to your Lordship, having no other ends or object in this my Dedication, but that this booke of mine having the ho∣nour to be countenanced by so great a personage, and the felici∣ty to be protected by so honourable a Mecaenas, may therefore encounter the more safely with the various humors it shall meet with, and abide more securely the different censures of this our too fastidious age.
How these Histories (or the memorable accidents which they containe and relate) will relish with your Lordships palate or judgement, I know not; Only because you are a Noble Son of Gods Church, and an Excellent Servant to your Prince and Countrey, I therfore rather hope than presume, that your Honor will at least be pleased to see, if not delight to know and consider, how the Triumphs of Gods Revenge and punishments doth herein secretly and providently meet with this crying and scarlet sinne of premeditated Murther, and with the bloudy and inhumane Perpetrators thereof, who hereby (as so many mercilesse Butchers, and prodigious Monsters of mankind) doe justly make themselves odious to Men, and execrable to God and his Angels.
God hath (deservedly) honoured your Lordship with the fa∣vour of two great Earthly Kings your Soveraignes, as first of our royallKing Iames, the father, and now of our present most Renowned King Charles his Son, and yet this externall Ho∣nour and favour of their is no way so glorious to you, as that (maugre the reigning vices of the world) you serve the true God of heaven, in the purity of your heart, and feare and adore him in the integrity of your Soule. And to represent you with

naked Truth, and not with Eloquence or Adulation. This Heavenly Piety of yours I beleeve is the prime reason, and true Essentiall cause of all this your earthly Honour, and sublu∣nary Greatnesse, and that this is it likewise which doth so re∣joyce your heart, and inrich and replenish your House with so nu∣merous and Noble an Issue, of hopefull and flourishing Children, who (as so many Olive branches of Vertue, and Syents and Plants of Honour) doe both inviron your Bed, and surround your Table, and who promise no lesse than futurely to magnifie the bloud, and to perpetuate and immortalize the Illustrious Name and Family of the Herberts, to all Posterity.
Goe on resolutely and constantly (Noble Lord) in your re∣ligious Piety to God, and in your Candide and unstained Fide∣lity to your Prince and Countrey, that your life may triumph o're your death, and your Vertues contend to out-shine your For∣tunes, and that hereafter God (of his best favour and mercy) may make you as blessed and as glorious a Saint in Heaven, as now you are a great Peere and Noble Pillar here on Earth, which none shall pray for with more true zeale, nor desire or wish with more reall and unfained affection, than
