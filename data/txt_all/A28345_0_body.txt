MY LORD,
THe soul of man, the glories of the world, are never sitting face to face, nor side by side, much lesse rest they as in one bed, but are ever looking like the East and West one from another, and although in this po∣sture they seem to be coupled, it is but by the thred of life, which every little distemper, years, age or causualty snaps asunder, tumbling both as in one moment wider from each other; than is the Sun and shadow, nor are these, the soul of man, the glo∣ries of the world standing still, or resting in this present posture, back to back, but like to penny birds upon a painted board, are alwayes dopping down the head, and picking one another; sure I am the soul, thrice noble and immortal may pick and, peck for in this flattering-world, honours, glories, joyes and pleasures in a greedy way, but these plea∣sures dig down fast and soon this glory, yea God, I was about to say, the soul of man, or breath of his, yea they dig down that as low as hell, and in a moments time all your dayes, my Lord, are no more, nor are they that, compared with eternity;
 if the heavens be but as the wearing of a garment out, what is then the life of man but as the putting on or off? yea the glance of it, much less are all his wants, fears, hopes, joyes and glories.
O my soul, flee away from all these things, be at rest, yea, at work, if there be time and opportu∣nity in thy hand, to do for God, self, souls, or na∣tions; Why should eternity drop upon thee, or thou roul into it before thou art aware? Do what thou wilt; dye and get thee hence to thine own place, come no more here, men are plotting, God prevents, the mourners go about the street, but the Spirit to him that gave it, Go, Welldone, Well∣come.
