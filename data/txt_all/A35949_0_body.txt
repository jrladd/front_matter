Right Honourable.
IT is a sweet and remarkable Providence, that within these not many yeers, such a multitude of Impressions of the holy Scriptures are vented among these three united Kingdoms, and so many thou∣sands are of Scots and English, who delight not only to have the holy Bible in their possession and houses; but also to carry it in their pockets, for reading of it upon all occasions: This, as it speaketh much of the desire after divine Knowledge, raised up by God in peoples hearts; and as it promiseth much of the spreading of the light of the Gospel in these Dominions, (especially the Lord having now seconded his own Work, by drawing, from the fountain of his own free grace, the

body of these Kingdoms into a solemn Covenant, for purging of all his holy Ordinances, and promoving of sound Religion) so doth it call aloud to all the Pastors of his Flock, and to all the godly learned, by all means to lead the Lords people in upon the right understand∣ing of the Scriptures, left the plain and marvellously consonant word of God be mistaken and wrested, by the instability and unskilfulnesse of such as have not their senses exercised to discern the single meaning of the Lords Voyce, and the admirable harmony of his heavenly Speeches. Many worthy men of God (it is true) have profitably taken pains to this purpose, and some have written large Commentaries upon sundry Books, and parcels of Scripture; others have transla∣ted out of Latine the Commentaries of others: But of those worthy mens Labours, only such as have much leasure, and patience to read, can make use: Others have written short Paraphrases of harder places; o∣thers, Expositions of hard words; others have mind∣ed herewith some sweet notes and observations, all of them contributing one with another to the common good, so much as each sort of Writing could carry: Yet besides all these laudable wayes of explication of Scripture, it seemeth that these dangerous Times, (wherein so many diverse errours are privily crept in, and begun openly also to avow themselves) do call for such an Explanation of the whole Bible, as might not only shew the scope of each Book and Chapter, with the cohesion of the Verses, and the meaning of the Words; but also propone the speciall heads of Do∣ctrine in each place, whereby people might see the whole grounds of Religion in the Text, and be guar∣ded against all damnable errours (in which those per∣sons are easily ensnared, who know not the Scriptures,

nor the power of God) and all this to be in such brevi∣ty and cleerness, That men in their daily set-reading of the Lords word, might in the space of half an hour per∣use a competent portion of Scripture, thus explained.
I say, Set-time for their private reading, because, al∣beit every man is not set apart for the Word and Do∣ctrine, but most part have, by Gods appointment, ci∣vil callings and necessary imployments about the mat∣ters of this life, each calling and imployment having its own work, and each work requiring his own time, so that there remaineth little time beside unto many; yet that man is too much busied in temporall affairs, and more involved in the World then he can answer for, who doth not daily redeem so much time, as the necessary exercise of Religion in the Word and Prayer doth require; beside secret ejaculations of Prayer unto God, mixed with his affairs, and the Mason-like-looks of his Conscience, levelling its eye to each action, to see if it be conform to the Rule: for presuppose a man were imployed as much as a King, and had so many Realms to govern as were under David K. of Israel, yet could he not be excused for this, to neglect Gods word & prayer; for Dav. oftner then once a day, yea, & in the night al∣so found time to call on God, & praise his name, & verse himself in his Word, Ps. 119.55, 62, 164. Let the men of this world, who have their portion in this life, & have set up in their hearts the filthy idols of worldly profit, pleasure & preferment, for gaining & keeping wherof, they make use not only of all men, but also of God and Religion, so far only as they may be suitable & service∣able to their base ends; Let such men (I say) neglect reading the Scriptures, and all serious following of re∣ligious exercises: But let not the children of God do so, who hold their standing here, and the hopes of eternal

life hereafter by faith in Christ, for promoving of whose cause and Kingdom, they are resolved to bear his Crosse, were it even to the doors of Heaven, if so GOD please, and to lay it down on the threshold with thanks and praise, that ever they were counted worthy to suffer for his Name; let not these blessed Soules walk in the way of the ungodly, but rather de∣light themselves in the Law of GOD, and meditate therein night and day, Psal. 1.2, 3. For the service of such saints, and facilitating of their reading of ho∣ly Scripture, I come forth (as before in the brief Ex∣planation of the Epistle to the Hebrews, so now in the brief explanation of the Evangel according to Matthew) to call yet again unto the Godly Learned, to stir up themselves for contributing one with ano∣ther, unto some such brief explanation of the whole Bible, as their Godly wisdome shall agre upon a mould, this or any other: because apparently, it is but little, and not considerable; which any one man alone can overtake in this Work.
As for this Piece, such a one as it is, There is great reason why it should bear your Honourable Name in the title of it, it being a part of the fruit of your Lordships labour, who as One eminently carefull of the purity of Gods ordinances, hath with others of our Renowned Nobility, faithfull Gentrie and Bur∣rows, run the hazard of all things in this life, and of life it self, to purge the land from superstition, and Heresie, and to give freedome, not only to the prea∣ching of the Truth of the Gospel, but also unto Pens and Presses for propagation of it. What singular Proofes of Integrity, and inflexible Constancy your Honour hath given in this great work of uniting

these three kingdomes more nearly unto God, and a∣mong themselves in the matters of Religion, it is so well known, that I need say nothing, but bless God for the raising up of so many precious Sons of Sion to take their Mother by the Hand, in the day of her ca∣lamity, and give thanks to his Majesty for your Lord∣ships in particular.
ANd as for Your Honour, My Lord Mauchlin, I could not but joyn your Lordships Name with Your Noble Father in this Dedication; partly, because you follow up so hard after his foot-steps, that your gracious and prudent Behaviour, observed by all Be∣holders, hath drawn from your Condesciples in Philo∣sophy a more ample elogy, then either your Lord∣ships Modesty, or my measure of Commendation of men will suffer me to repeat; partly, that your Lord∣ship may be thus yet more ingaged to drink in, and maintain that Doctrine of Salvation by Christ, which giveth the text of his Testament for a Pawn and Pledg of its verity; The love and fruitfull Profession where∣of, that it may b the constant Glory of the House of Lodoun, is the hearty prayer of
