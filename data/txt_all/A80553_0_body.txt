My Lord,
I Find my self, with many others, represented to Your Honors view in as odious Colours as Malice it self could deblazon, in Mr. Bacons Printed Relation of his usage in Gloucester. Whereupon I conceive my self bound to maintain my in∣tegrity both in respect of my person as a Christian, and of my calling as a Minister. I have therefore published this Vindication, which  present to Your Lordship, be∣seeching You to receive it as an humble yet necessary ad∣dresse to Your Lordships Justice. Had I declined this Appeal, I might either be thought guilty, or to derogate from Your equity and impartiality. But I know that Your great and Noble Spirit highly disdains the patronage of the least falshood, and will condescend to a Vindication of the Truth from what ever hand it comes. Let your Ho∣nour be pleased to conceive of me, as one who desires and should joy in your favourable opinion. My prayer is, that according to Your renowned Piety your Name may be precious and Honourable, for promoving a blessed Re∣formation, and the fixed Ordinances of Jesus Christ: and for this the Souls of the people of God shall blesse You.
