Madam,
ACcording to your Com∣mands, I have taught the Fugitive Fair One to speak English, and
 have given Her this Pasport, that She Her self may go and give you an Ac∣count of Her Ad∣ventures. I hope they will afford you the Entertainment you expect, and that they will divert some Hours of you Solitude in the Country. There is something so Ex∣traordinary in Her
 Story as cannot but render it Agreeable, and which will keep you from Repent∣ing the time you shall spend in Her Company: At least, Madam, I have shown herein the Absolute Obedience I pay to all your Orders, tho I shall ever be Rea∣dy to give much more Signal Instan∣ces of my Entire
 Submission and Re∣signation to all you shall require. This Offering in the mean while, I beg, may be an Earnest of my future Per∣formances, and if it obtains a Gracious Acceptance, I shall be the more Anima∣ted to further Essaies to please you. Yes, Madam, if you grant but this Fair One a fa∣vourable
 Audience, I shall have satisfied my Ambition, in having been Her Usher, and the Zeal I had to find an Oc∣casion of Declaring with what profound Respect I am,
Madam,
