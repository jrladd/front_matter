WOrshipfull Sir, calling to my minde, that great good will that you haue borne vnto me and mine, since the time of my first acquain∣tance with you: except I should be to forgetfull and vngratefull, I must remember you, and be as thanke∣full, as my poore abilitie will serue. But the woorme of good will still gnawing my mynde thereto at last, all daintie meates and viandes set aside, which are common remembrances, yet vayne and soone forgotte, but whyle they are a eating. There came vnto my hande a Scottishe Pamphlet, of the Fabulous Tales of Esope, a worke, sir as I thinke, in that language wherin it was written, verie eloquent and full of great inuention. And no doubt you shall finde some smatch thereof, al∣though very rudely I haue obscured the Authour, and hauing two yeres since turned it into Englishe, I haue kept it vnpublished, hoping some els of greater skill would not haue let it lyen dead. But whether most men haue that nation in derision for their hollowe hearts and vngratefull mindes to this countrey alwayes had (a peo∣ple verie subiect to that infection) or thinking scorne of the Authour or first inuenter, let it passe, as friuolous and vaine matter: yet in my conceite there is learning for all
 sorts of people worthy the memorie. Therefore knowing not howe by any meanes to let you vnderstand my good will towarde you, but by this meanes, at last putting all feare aside, I boldly present this vnto your worship, ho∣ping that at vacant time when other matters of great im∣portance be layde aside, that you will not deine to re∣create your minde with this trifle, where you shall finde doctrine both pleasant and profitable, and hoping as oft as you looke on this booke you will thinke on me, accepte this poore Persian water or Iewes mite, which in so doing I care not for all the scoffers and taunters, which will do nought themselues nor suffer others to do that may plea∣sure or profit the posteritie. I craue of God to encrease you with worldly Worshippe to his pleasure.
