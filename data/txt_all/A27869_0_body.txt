SIR,
THough I have little Acquaintance with you, nor de∣sire to have more, I take upon me, with the Assu∣rance of a Poet, to make this Dedication to you, which I hope you will the more easily excuse, since you have often us'd the same freedom to others; and since I protest sincerely, that I expect no Money from you.
I cou'd not forbear mentioning your Admired Lewis, whom you compare to Augustus, as justly as one may com∣pare you to Virgil; Augustus (though not the most exact Pattern of a Prince) yet, on some Occasions, show'd Perso∣nal Valour, and was not a League-Breaker, a Poisoner, a Pyrat: Virgil was a good Man and a clean Poet, all his Excellent Writings may be carried by a Child in one hand more easily, than all your Almanzors can be by a Porter upon both shoulders.
When I saw your prodigious Epistle to the Translation of Juvenal, I fear'd you were wheeling to the Government; I confess too I long expected something from you on the late sad occasion, that has employ'd so many Pens, but 'tis well that you have kept silence; I hope you'll always be on the other side; Did ev'n Popery ever get any honour by you?

 You may wonder that I subscribe not my Name at length, but I defer that to another time: I hear you are Translating again, let English Virgil be better than English Juvenal, or 'tis odds you'll hear of me more at large; in the mean time, hoping that you and your Covey will dislike what I have written, I remain,
Sir,
