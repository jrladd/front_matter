AS first your paines in bearing me was such
A benefit beyond requitall, that twere much
To thinke what pangs of sorrow you sustain'd
In child-birth, when mine infancy obtain'd
The vitall drawing in of ayre, so your loue
Mingled with care hath shewen it selfe, aboue
The ordinary course of Nature: seeing you still
Are in perpetuall Labour with me, euen vntill
The second birth of education perfect me,
You Trauaill still though Churched oft you be.


In recompence thereof what can I giue,
But what I take, euen that I liue,
Next to the heavens 'tis yours. Thus I pay



My debt by taking vp at interest, and lay
To pawne that which I borrow of you: so
The more I giue I take, I pay, I owe.
Yet lest you thinke I forfait shall my bond
I here present you with my writing hand.
Some trifling minutes I vainely did bestow
In penning of these lines that all might know
The scandals of our aduersarie, and
I had gone forward had not Hester hang'd
Haman before: yet what here I wrote
Might serue to stop the curs wide throat,
Vntill the haltar came, since which I ceast
To prosecute what I intended, lest
I should be censur'd that I vndertooke
A worke that's done already: so his booke
Hath scapt my fingers, but in like case
As a malefactor changeth place
From Newgate vnto Tiburne, whose good hope
Is but to change his shackels for a rope.


Although this be a toy scarce worth your view,
Yet deigne to reade it, and accept in lieu
Of greater dutie, for your gracious looke
Is a sufficient Patrone to my booke.


This is the worst disgrace that can be had.
A Ladies daughter worm'd a dog that's mad.
