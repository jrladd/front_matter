THy early Love to Hermetick Philo∣sophy,
sincere Respects to the Masters of it, and long
perseverance in the Study were sufficient motives to Communicate
what might fall into my hands that was rare and valuable, tho
the
Obligations of Friendship were less
numerous.
The Enclosed Manu∣script I have had by me for some
time, but for some Rea∣sons could not communicate it so soon as my
respects to thy self and it, would have
prompt me. I have not seen, nor heard of many Copies, therefore for
its No∣velty may presume, and for its worth
speak what I think, That it is a com∣pendious and
plain Theo∣ry of the Principles of Na∣ture in
general, and of Her∣metick
Practice in parti∣cular: Not
Phantastically talked of, but fundamen∣tally evinced from
the ne∣cessity thereof, and Autho∣rity of the Ancient
Philoso∣phers: Fully manifesting the impossibility of the
contra∣ry through the uniformity and Regularity of Natures
Actions in the Production of the several Species of Na∣tural and
perfect Bodies.
For the Author I shall nor presume to give
any judgement since he is plea∣sed to conceal his
Name
and Circumstances, & there by lye
obscure (the pra∣ctice of Hermetick Writers) But this we
may learn, that his Candor and Brotherly Love to the
Studious and Religious stile, Entitles him to
Christianity as well as his Matter and Method doth
to Knowledge and Practice in the School of Hermes
and Nature; whether he be old or young, Native or
Stran∣ger. And since he has been thus solicitous
and even stu∣dious to prevent Errors in all, and to direct
the feet of
the worthy in the way of Truth, we
must reasonably believe he hath taken the best method
to effect it, which is to inculcate the know∣ledge
of true Principles and possibility of Nature. And indeed
I have long concei∣ved the Multitude of Errors in
Practice, that have hap∣pened to the searchers of Art, has
been most owing to the Ignorance in Principles, and the
want of a Previous understanding in the Law of
Nature.
Nature no doubt, has a
Law she cannot transgress, let
us therefore study to know that, and we shall
not at∣tempt it neither; Art or Ac∣cidents may frustrate
her end and cause Abortion, but neither carry her to or
be∣yond her usual Perfection, but in her own
way.
This small Tract, worthy Friend, Concisely
teaches what the Fire and water, or Agent and
Patient, that are active or living are; how
they are said to be living; what their life; and how
un∣derstood: and indeed the Na∣ture
and Reason of the Hermetick Art very
much Illustrated thereby.
Neither is it barren of so much Divinity, and some
pe∣culiar Hints, (that may af∣ford pleasure and profit to
one so intent thereon) as be∣comes so deep Philosophy; which
doubtless is the shadow of Divinity, or Younger Sister.
And indeed I could wish the contemplation of Gods Works
in Nature were less omitted by the Christian
pro∣fessors of our Age, and the
Lucre of Gain more; seing
it tends to the honour of God, good of our
Neigh∣bour, and satisfaction of our selves every
way, except our satisfaction be in much Riches and
Honour, pur∣chased with our most pre∣cious time, and
possessed with Ignorance and Folly; which is
very short of the Nobility of our Intulect and
end of Creation; and for which we must
surely give an Account.
Is not the Christian ena∣bled to ascribe the
Attri∣butes
of Wisdom and Pow∣er to
God, in the Conside∣ration and Contemplation of
the Number and Mag∣nitude, Order and Beauty of the
Works of Creation, as he is those of his
goodness and Mercy, which is over all his Works,
in manifesting the same word by which they were made, to
redeem and restore them; the last absolutely
necessary, the first altogether becoming and
adorning a virtuous and pious mind, and
Christian Profession.

Doubtless the Natural and Mechanick knowledge
acquired by Solomon, no way unfitted but qualified
him for a Divine: Who when he had erected that glorious
Edifice, and beautified it with the choicest Products of
Nature and Art, as a Naturalist and
Mecha∣nick, Dedicated the same in great wisdom as a
Divine. We have Reason to believe the Psalmist
no less filled with the consideration of the Attributes that are
Ma∣nifest in the Creation, which
even compelled him to cele∣brate the same
almost con∣tinually. And indeed nothing less is to be thought than
that a mind thus possessed with admiration should
con∣tinually fear so great, love so good, and
adore so glorious a Being, incom∣prehensible
Power and Majesty: Neither has indeed the Holy
Apostles and followers of Christ fallen short but
rather excelled in this. And truly, respected Friend, the
Characters of Nature are preferable to
those of Men, since they are
Gods, and such our Lord himself chose
to shew forth the greatest Mysteries by. Therefore if ignorant of them
how shall we understand his Sermons and Doctrine aright.
Much might be said, but in as much, worthy Friend, there is
no need of Arguments to covince, tho this may
incourage one so fully satisfied of its Utility,
innocency and profit, to prosecute the same with dili∣gence
& Judgement, and to prefer it to the Mean and
unbecoming practices of our Age,
that solicite nothing but Gain or Greatness, and
miserably live in this world without the knowledge of
Gods greatness and Wis∣dom, love and Mercy, made
manifest in his Creation and its Redemption.
But least I should Trans∣gress my intended
Limits, and detain too long from the Inclosed, I shall
refer what might otherwise have been here offered in Relation to the
Secret Art of Hermes, to another Opportunity more
convenient, and in the mean while continue to desire
thy Prosperity and happiness every way, as I have
hither∣to done who am thy Friend in Sincerity and
Affection.
