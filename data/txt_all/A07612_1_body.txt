THese daies past I wrote a booke of all thinges which come frō your Occidentall Indias, seruing for the vse of medicine, and surely it hath been taken in that estimati∣on, that the things which in it are intreated of doe de∣serue. And seeing the profite that it hath done, and howe many haue been remedied and healed with those reme∣dies, I did determine to proceede forwardes, & to write of the thinges, which after that the first part was written, haue come from those countries, of the which I haue vn∣derstood, that no lesse vtilitie and profite shal come, then of those which are past, for there shalbe discouered newe thinges & secrets, which will bring admiration, neuer to this day seene nor knowne before. And seeing that these medicinall things which we do treate of, & the Realmes and Countries from whence they come, belong vnto your maiestie, and he also that writeth of them, is your Maiesties subiect: I doe desire your Maiestie, to receiue this trauell into your protection, and that the reward may be such, as for the like workes dedicated to your Maiestie is accusto∣med to be geuen.
