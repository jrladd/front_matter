THE chiefest thing (Right Honorable and my sin∣gular good Lord) that emboldneth men to dedi∣cate, their labours vnto any personage, is the af∣finitie betweene the matter of the worke, which they offer, and the minde of him to whom it is presented. And as the auncient comicall Poetes were wōt to pen such Enterludes, as they thought would be plausibly heard of their auditory: soe our common writers doe fashion and shape the subiect of which they entreat, according to the affection of him, whose patronage they require in countenaū∣cing their writings: this (I say) though it be practised of all writers now a daies, and migt haue serued as a fitte president for me to haue follo∣wed: yet haue I swarued and digressed from so generall a custome, in preferring this labour of mine to the vewe of your Honor (the matter so far dissenting from your Honors dispositions) so that as it may per∣haps not without som colour be obiected, that I might haue prouided far better (had I bene any way sufficient) both for the acceptation of my labour, & also for the fit answering of your Honors affectiō, if I had treated of the politick gouernment of our contry, & of the weilding of a commonwealth: to the necessity of which calling, not Fortune the Queene of the old Philosophers, but God himselfe hath called, or ra∣ther enforced you if that opiniō of Plato be true, that euery good Ma∣gistrate taketh vpon him his office vnwillingly. But that obiection will sone be taken away, if we cōsider how foolish a thing it were to instruct

him with his imaginarie precepts, whom (besides a great light of na∣ture) most happie experience hath made a perfect & absolute gouer∣nour. Plato that most graue and wise deemer of the state tyrannicall, was so many times conuicted of follie, howe often he aduentured in the presence of kinges to discourse of the regiment of a common wealth. Dionysius (of whom it was doubted, whether he did more harme by his extreame crueltie, or good by his prouident wisedome which both he left alike to his successours to imitate) called that nota∣ble Philosopher (whom I euen now named) in Scicilia of purpose to heare him, and with great patience listened to him, as he disputed of mannes felicitie and admired him as he handled those morall vertues, which Socrates his maister was feigned to haue brought from heauen, and as he treated of the frame & machine of the world: but on a time (taking aduauntage by the kinges attention) when he had stolne into the discourse of pollicie, Dionysius felt himselfe so moued, that he had exercised his tyrannie against him also, if Dio and Aristomanes had not recouered him out of his iawes, and so ridde him out of the land, by selling him to Polis the Lacedemonian marchaunt. And this was the verdict, that the wise king (when his furie was somewhat calmed) gaue of that most learned Philosopher for his holesome counsell (as he thought) namely, that his discourses seemed vnto him to be the prattles of idle olde men: so much experience disdaineth to be con∣trolled by arte, and so impatient is he of institution, whose knowledg is acquired Vsu & Memoria, (the two auncient parentes of wise∣dom.) VVhat a great argument of follie therefore shall he giue, that shall go about to lay a plot for your Honor, from whence you may de∣riue an example of gouernment, who haue so many yeares in so trou∣blesome a common wealth, and to the most wise & vertuous Princesse in the world ben reteined as a most honorable and graue counsellour? I will not say, as Zopyrus vnto Darius, or as Cineas vnto his Pyrrhus, or as Cresus vnto his Cyrus, the one of which by pollicie aduised his king to circumuent his enemies, the other allured them to his subie∣ction by his eloquence, & the third by his own vnfortunat experience directed him howe to conuey any daungerous enterprise. All which serued their Princes to none other vse, but to helpe them to purchase the worst part of glorie by bloudie oppression: but rather as a Nestor vnto his Agamemnon, as a Zenophon vnto his Cyrus, & as a Plutarch

vnto his Traian, which thought it not so glorious to tie their enemies to them by forced feare, as their friends and neighbours by peaceable amitie, the strongest gard that Princes can trust vnto. I must needes confesse that these cōparisons do faile in representing so much as I do conceiue, for that I may not feare the suspitiō of flatterie in so manifest a truth, can the whole Scene of mans life so gorgeouslie & stately set forth by the historiās of seueral ages, shew vs at one time, on one stage two such notable actors (namely) so redoubted, so perelesse, & so ver∣tuous a Princesse holding the scepter, so graue, so wise, & so prouident a counseller susteyning the person of Eubolus? I would I might (my credit saued with your Honor) persue your prayses yet further, but I know very well, that you (who with an vnwearied affectiō do not cease continually to cōmit such vertuous deedes as deserue to be eternized for euer, are sone tired, when you heare them remembred by another. And truely I would not haue spoken so much for feare of offence, but that I know for a certainety, that you ascribe the being of your vertues to God the giuer of al good things, befor whō to extenuat our graces, I know not whither it be more blame worthy, thē shamelesly to assume vnto our selues, whatsoeuer is wrōgfully attributed vnto vs by our flat∣tering friēds. But to what end (will you saie) are all these words? name∣ly to this: to excuse my selfe, in that I haue not laboured to fit your affe∣ction in the presentmēt of this my labour, which is so impossible, in res∣pect of your singular knowledg in al kind of good lerning, that there is no mā so selfwise or loftie, which feareth not to come vnder your lear∣ned censure. VVhich excellēcie of yours when I had loked into, & had found my selfe altogether vnable to answere: I purposed (as I thought) more politicklie to assaie your humanitie, which (in deed) graceth all the rest of your vertues, which (I thought) I might sone abuse in offering such a subiect, in which some study, & industrie (besides many yeares had made me in part able to iudge, & such a one, as the earnest affaires of the Common wealth, in which you are alwayes busied, togeather with the inconuenient vneasines of the studie hath kepte your Honor from being acquainted with. VVhich bold attempt of mine, your wise∣dome shall so much the easier be brought to pardon, by how much the more ernestly your rare clemencie encouraged me to enterprise it: for I do plainely confesse, that I haue not thought this Booke of mine wor∣thy to be perused of your Honor, aswell because of mine owne vnabili∣ty,

who am altogeither insufficient to performe any thing that your Ho¦nor may like of, as also in respect of those manifold graces, wherewith the Lord hath filled you: by the vertue of which you could in a tongue (farre more eloquent then this of ours) discerne and know the secrets of phisicke which I haue now in part reuealed: If the common weale of vs all did not rather cary you away, then that delight which is other∣wise reaped by priuate study. And yet neuerthelesse, when I consi∣der with my selfe, that it was not the affectation of any popular praise, but an honest zeale to benefite my countrimen, which begotte in me this desire to publish this worke, and also (yf I may without the suspect of vaine glorie seeme to diuine of the issue of my laboures) perceiuing that they might bring some commodity vnto the more ignorant sorte of our common Practicioners & Aemperiques (if they were with di∣ligence perused:) and thirdly, when I perceiued in my selfe a certaine earnest willingnes which I haue alwayes had (though of late it hath bene more vehemently inflamed) to commend some peece of seruice vnto your Honor: (I say) these causes meeting thus together did es∣pecially adduce me (though many doubtes stept afore me in mine enterprise, offring to reenforce my ouer presumptuous determinatiō) with such a bold confidency as it were to rush into your presence, and to demaund without any shew of merite your Honors most fauorable Protection, that this booke of mine (vnable of it selfe) may run vnder your Patronage, which as it were Gorgon his buckler, I will obuert and turne against all the venemous bitinges of sclanderous tongues. The Lord God, (who hath made you a notable instrument to worke the aduauncement of his glorie, the furtheraunce and propagation of good learning) lengthen & protract your life beyond your fatall period, and giue you a will to liue, a desire still to beare vp that bur∣then, which her Maiestie hath laid vpon your shoulders, & with these, all good successe in this world, and eternall happines in his kingdom.
