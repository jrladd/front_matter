IN your truely Noble affections there is an heau'nly har∣monie, by the operation of Grace; in your corporall con∣stitutions, an harmony of the Elements, by the highest art of Nature; in your heroicall carriage and actions, an har∣monie by the worke of wel-discerning Iudgement; and, in all, such an highly-commended symphonie each with other, that to no two (as One) could I more properly consecrate these ensuing Accents, comming from, and tending to Harmonie, then to you. If then they like you, it argues them most harmonious, sith like loues the like. But howsoeuer, I humbly referre both my selfe and them, to your fauour and good opinion; which with my harts-ioy makes such harmonie, as Amphions sweetest straines cannot halfe so much glad mee; Euer remayning, the humble honourer and ad∣mirer of your heroicall perfections.
