SIR,
YOur acquaintance with the Author before his death was not long, which I have oft heard you say, you coun∣ted your great unhappinesse, but within a short time af∣ter, you knew not well whe∣ther to count your selfe more happie in that you once knew him, or unhappy in that upon your acquain∣tance you so suddenly lost him. This his worke then being to come forth to the censorious eye of the

world, and as the manner usually is to have some Patronage. I have thought good to dedicate it to your selfe; and that for these two reasons especially.
First, in respect of the sympathy betwixt it, and your studies; Laboures of this nature being usually offered to such persons whose profession is that way setled
Secondly, for the great love and respect you alwayes shewed to the Author, being indeed a man that would deserve no lesse, humble, void of pride, ever ready to impart his knowledge to o∣thers in what kind soever, loving and affecting those that affected learning.
For these respects then, I offer to you this Worke of your so much honoured friend. I my selfe also (as it is no lesse my duty) for his sake stri∣ving to make you hereby some part of a requitall, least I should be found guilty of ingratitude, which is a solecisme in manners, if having so fit an opportunity, I should not expresse to the world some Testimonie of love to you, who so much loved him. I desire then (good Sir) your kind acceptance of it, you knowing so well the ability of the Au∣thor, and being also able to judge of a Worke of this

nature, and in that respect the better able to de∣fend it from the furie of envious Detractours, of which there are not few. Thus with my best wishes to you, as to my much respected friend, I rest.
