My Lord,
THE Relation I formerly
had to Your Lordship, and
to the Excellent Countess Your
Mother, who, like King Solo∣mon's
wise Woman, hath Buil∣ded
Her House, and by Her
extraordinary Prudence, accom∣panied
with the Divine Blessing,
hath raised the now Third Earl∣dom
in this Kingdom to its Anci∣ent
Greatness and Splendour;
this Double Relation, I say, hath

Emboldened me to make a Dedi∣cation
of this Discourse to Your
Lordship: But there are also se∣veral
other Considerations that
induce me thereunto: As par∣ticularly,
I know Your Lordship to be a
Sober and Virtuous Person; and
that, as the Grace of God did
Guard your Youth, and make the
Pious and Solicitous Care of so
Good a Mother happily successful
to preserve you from all inclina∣tion
to the Debaucheries of the
Age; which have proved so Fa∣tal
to not a few Great Men and
Great Families; so since your
coming to years of Consideration
and Iudgment, You have not

onely upon deliberate Choice to∣tally
deelined them, but from the
Love of Virtue heartily detested
them.
I know your Lordship to be ex∣cellently
well Principled, both
as a Subject of his Majesty, and
a Son of the Church of England;
and to be a perfect Enemy to the
two great Adversaries of both,
viz. Popery and Fanaticism.
And that, as a Noble Clergie∣man
of this Church was your
Grandfather, so your Lordship
hath always been an Affectionate
Friend and Patron of her Cler∣gie;
and have had a very parti∣cular
Value for those of them
whose Piety, Prudence and

Learning intitle them to Esteem.
But I will not enlarge so far
as truly I might upon this subject,
I shall onely add, that I know
your Lordship to be a Lover of
Books and Learning (wherein
you attained to very good Profi∣ciency,
by your noted Studious∣ness
and Industry in the Vniver∣sity)
but chiefly to Admire that
sort of Learning which incompa∣rably
Excelleth all other, viz.
That which our Great Master
Christ Jesus hath so highly Ad∣vanc'd
and Perfected: The De∣sign
of which is to make us wise
to Salvation, and Happy both in
this World and to All Eternity.
And this (if your Lordship

shall vouchsafe to peruse it) you
will find is for a great part the
immediate Business of the fol∣lowing
Treatise: As it is of the
remainder, to Vndermine and
Subvert those Principles, both
Popish and others, which are of
so Pernicious Consequence, and
infinitely Mischievous to that
Design.
I am so well Acquainted with
your Lordships Candour and In∣genuity,
as to presume that it will
easily overlook the many Defects
of this Discourse, for the sake of
that Honest Meaning which your
Charity will believe prompted
me to the Writing and Publicati∣on
of it.
God Almighty continue to
multiply His Blessings both Spi∣ritual
and Temporal upon Your
Lordship, together with Your
Pious and Eminently Charitable
Lady, Your Hopeful Children,
and the Rest of Your as Happy as
Noble Family. This is, and
shall be the Hearty Prayer of,
MY LORD,
