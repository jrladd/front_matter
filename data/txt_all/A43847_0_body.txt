My Friend,
THese Lines to thee are sent that thou mayst them review,
Because I know thou dost Believe and Seest in things are True.
So that if ought be Unsav'ry, and thou dost know the Fault,
Thou having in thy House Seas'ning, put thereto the Earths Salt.
Moreover I not willing am, that Truth at all be Blam'd,
Nor would I do or give out ought that any should be sham'd.

 Therefore unto the Sanctu'ry I do my Weights forth bring
The Ballance thereof them to try, this is the only thing.
To have all right and made good weight, Infirmities to heal,
And what Weights equal are and just, on them to strike the Seal.
Which when they have Truths Seal on them Oh! then none will question:
Let the Noble Bereans search, they'l find the Weights all one.
