My LORD,
IT is so unusual in this Age, to confer Benefits unsought, especially such as your Lord∣ship was pleased lately to think me worthy of; that I ought to have the higher esteem, not merely of your Lordship's singular kindness to me, but chiefly of that noble principle of Vertue in your mind from whence it purely flowed. Which will excuse, I hope, the presumption of this De∣dication; to which I am prompted by nothing, but onely an eager desire, publickly to testifie my gratitude to your Lordship, as soon as it was possible. Which made me lay hold upon the very first opportunity, that presented it self: and chuse rather to prefix your Lordship's great Name, to the remainder of this Work (part of which was published some months ago) then let any thing appear in the world under my name, which did not carry along with it a thank∣full acknowledgment of my obliga∣tions to your Lordship. To whose Judgment knowing persons attribute so much; that as it is a very great honour to receive any mark of your Lordship's good opinion, so it is a preferment to which, whether I will or no, your Lordship hath advanced me.
I will endeavour not to fall from it by forgetfulness of your Lordship's favours; but preserve such a re∣membrance of them, as is sutable to the present sense I have of them: which is as much beyond what I can express, as they are beyond what I could deserve.
The best expression I can make of it will be in my prayers to God, that, as the King hath made you the su∣preme Dispenser of his Justice to his People, and his Divine Majesty hath made you a great Pattern of Piety and Devotion, as well as other exemplary Vertues; so, He would be pleased to give you wise∣dom and prudence to conduct your self with such dexterity as well as integrity in the management of all the publick Business, with the care of which you are intrusted, that you may continue (as you are) a sup∣porter of the Government, a Patron of Religion, a Friend of good Men, and, in a word, a Blessing, not onely to your own vertuous Family but, to the whole Nation. For, though there are some so imperfect, that they will allow no such words to be said of any, but those that please them in every thing; yet, the most of good Men, or at least the best, will thankfully acknowledge the hap∣piness we enjoy in the Authority your Lordship hath, and will joyn in those Prayers with,
My LORD,
