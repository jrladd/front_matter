Worthy Sir,
HAving diligently inquired▪ the
reason of the projection of the
Sphere into plaine, as the ground
of all Mathematic Instru∣ments
(the making whereof in
Metall is my Trade and Live∣lihood)
and compared the severall manners; I
found none so genuine, simple, easie, and manifoldly
usefull, as is the Horizontall; which lively re∣presenteth
the Globe rectified to some certaine
elevation, and naturally performeth the uses
thereof. And having likewise compared the se∣verall
Quadrants, and pocket Instruments hither∣to
made, and finding them all pieced up with ma∣ny
unnaturall and forced lines and divisions, pre∣supposing
an exact diligence both in the Calcula∣tor,

and in the workman; and yet the performance
difficult, troublesome, and tedious: I bethought
my self whether out of the Horizontall projection
I might not by some smal alteration frame a Qua∣drant,
that might remedy the defects of all the
former Instruments, and that with greater ease
and certainty. And having by the help of God
happily attained my desired intent, my many re∣spects
represented you under whose Approbation
and Patronage I might send out into public
view this my new Quadrant, with the many Uses
thereof; as being one to whom I stand obliged for
your love and manifold favours to mee both at
Sea in divers Voiages, and at land; and who
through your skill in the Mathematicall Scien∣ces
are able to judge and patronize the first at∣tempts
of
