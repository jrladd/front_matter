IT beeing my chance (right Wor∣shipfull) to lighten vpon certaine paternes of cutworks, and others brought out of forrein countries, which haue bin greatly accepted of by diuers Ladies and Gentle∣women of sundrie nations, and consequentlie of the common-people: this seemed vnto mee a sufficient instance and Argument, to be∣stowe likewise some paines for the publishing there∣of. But beeing in suspence of the dedication: two causes induced me to imbolden my selfe to present it vnto your acceptation and patronage. First, because that rare deuises and inuentions are for the most part more agreeable and gratfuller accepted, then ordina∣rie and common thinges, although of great price and value. Secondlie, because these workes belong chiefly to Gentlewomen, for to passe away their time in ver∣tuous exercises. Wherefore to fit and accomodate the dedication aright to the contentes and subiect of the booke, I thought it not amisse to offer it vnto your Worship, in token of thankfulnes for so many bene∣fites
 which I haue receiued so bountifullie at your hands, assuring my selfe moreouer, that as these pa∣terns will bring sufficient contentment and profite to all welwillers that are desirous of this art, so they shall for euer acknowledge thēselues to be beholden chiefly vnto you, being the chiefest occasion of the publishing and setting forth thereof. And therefore vppon hope that you wil take these inuentions in good part, which in time I am purposed (if God permit) to increase and augment with more new paternes of workes: In the meane time I pray God giue to your Worship, a hap∣pie, prosperous, and a long life, with a full accom∣plishment of all your ver∣tuous desires.
