SIR,
I Hope not to incur
your blame, when I
prefix your Name to
this small Treatise. The Mat∣ter
is new, though long
sought after; the scope is the

publick good, and my pri∣vate
aim is to shew my gra∣titude
for so many obligati∣ons
you have been pleased to
lay upon me, besides my
hopes, that the design of the
Subject may perhaps be ap∣proved
by experiment, and
the smalness of the Volume
pass among those things that
are not illusory. And to
say truth, under whose
Wings could I have shel∣tered
it better than yours?
Whose Affability and
Candor is open to the

greatest Strangers, and par∣ticularly
my Self, with your
never enough to be com∣mended,
generous Hospita∣lity.
But my intention here,
being not to make your
Panegyrick, I supersede and
spare your Modesty, it be∣ing
sufficient to me, if the
Author and the Work
can deserve your Protecti∣on,
and the favorable
Looks of your worthy
Brother, Master Robert

Long, and so ingage me to
remain the rest of my days
