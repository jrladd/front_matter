DId Seneca now live, himself would say
That your Translation has not wrong'd his Play;
But that in every Page, in every Line,
Your Language do's with equal splendor shine.
His Roman Habit, and your English Dress
Themselves with a like Elegance express
Nor from your praise will it at all detract
To say the Tragedy's unfit to Act.
And that those Playes can never please the Age,
That hope for no Acquaintance with the Stage:
For to all those that judges are of Wit,
Fancy it self a Theatre will fit.
Each Scene expose to that Interior Eye,
And all the want of Actors too supply.
She can without expences of Treasure raise
New Structures still to fit our several Playes,
For which but at the charges of a thought,
Nature's and Arts embellishments are bought
Her Scenes, tho' they exist but in the mind,
Are ever fram'd to what the Play design'd.
Nor is she forc'd by Scarcity to make
A trifling Buffoon the Regalia take:
Constraining none whom Nature has design'd,
Only to Ape a Fool, against his kind,
To mannage Scepters; lest he should appear
With his ridiculous Grimaces where
Those loose Impertinences have no share.
Thus every Requisite is fitted so
That no dislike can from the Action grow:
And her Ideal Theater appears
With all the Lustre that attends on theirs.
Pleasant Scarron, whose Mock-Aeneas made
Virgil himself smile at the Masquerade;
Too much beyond his power, did justly fear
Would prove the Works of our Tragdian here.
But what he fear'd may now your Glory prove
Whose Quill runs free where his durst never move:
And like the Sword that cur'd the wounds it gave,
Makes us such pleasure, so much laughter have,
After the Passions it had made us share!
That 'tis but Reason to maintain you are
Favour'd in Verse with Ovid's happy Muse,
Whose Wit did with Success all Subjects use.
