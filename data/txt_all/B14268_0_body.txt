IT is come to passe (right VVorshipfull) with the businesse and plantation of Virginea, as it is com∣monly seene in the attempt and progresse of all other most excellent things, (which is) to be accompa∣nied with manifold difficulties, crosses and dis∣asters, being such as are appointed by the highest prouidence, as an exercise of patience and other vertues, and to make more wise thereby the ma∣nagers
thereof: by which occasion not only the ignorant and simple minded are much discou∣raged, but the malitious and looser sort (being accompanied with the licentious vaine of stage Poets) haue whet their tongues with scornfull taunts against the action it selfe, in so much as there is no common speech nor publike name of any thing this day, (except it be the name of God) which is more vildly depraued, traduced and derided by such vnhallowed lips, then the name of Virginea. For which cause (right noble Knight) J haue set my self to publish this briefe apollogie to the sight and view of all men, not to answer any such in their particular folly, but to free the name it selfe from the iniu∣rious scoffer, and this commendable enterprise from the scorne and derision of any such, as by ignorance or malice haue sought the way to wrong it. VVhich albeit J am well assured will no way auaile to admonish or amend the incor∣rigible loosenes of such vntamed tongues, yet shall I hold mine endeuours well acquited, if J may but free your selfe, and so many right no∣ble, and well affected gentlemen (touching the
former ill successe) from wrongfull imputation, as also satisfie the despairing thoughts, and quicken the zeale of such friends and louers to this businesse, as in their remote and forraine residence, by the spreading of rumours and false reports, doe rest vnsatisfied. VVherein (as J hope) not to exceed the bounds of modestie and truth, so for orders sake J haue set it downe in a briefe method of three parts. The first is no∣thing else but a briefe relating of things alrea∣die done and past: The second, of the present estate of the businesse: And the third doth tend as a premonition to the planters and aduentu∣rers for the time to come.
And this J offer to the patronage of your VVorship alone, being the chiefest patron of this and of many moe worthie seruices: where∣in J presume not any way to counsell or direct your wisedome in your further proceedings, whom long experience in Common-wealth af∣faires (besides that abilitie and wisedome of minde infused by God) hath made most able and sufficient of your selfe to direct many o∣thers, but as wishing heereby (if J might in
some measure) to ease the burthen of your mind, vnder the wise and painfull managing of your many publike actions: for which J pray that God will please, to continue still your health and strength of body, with answerable successe, to your honest, wise, and most approued desires.
