My Lord,
THis Discourse which I have presum'd, more at large, to venture in the world under your Lordships Patro∣nage, I must freely acknowledge I first fetch't it, more compendiously, from your self, under your Lordships own Roof; where is well as in the Pulpit, and in Publck it cannot easily escape the Notice of any (who will not wilfull, shut their eyes) how much your vigorous Discourses, your important Counsels, your active Endeavours, and constant Encouragements, all concur to make and keep an Exem∣plary Clergie; such, I mean; as may be a more visible grace to the Gospel, a greater Credit to the Church, a Blessing to the King and Kingdom, and a more lively Representation of the life of Christ (the foundation of all.)
And indeed, the present Age we live in, seems to out-do all before it, in its louder Calls for such a Clergie, whose Lves may be observ'd to keep some better pace with their Do∣ctrines; and not so much to fail and lurch the but just and reasonable expectations of the People; whilst they discover some amongst us, whose Lives, too too often prove (as it were) the death of that, they seem to press, with more than ordinary zeal, and concernedness, upon others.

My Lord; Its now become no hard matter to find ma∣ny of our Hearers, as it were, dead under the weight of our numerous Sermons; and there being nothing so probably effectual, to fetch them back to life again, as the more kind∣ly quickning influence, they may all fel from our own walk∣ing more, as burning and shining lights amongst them; I soon concluded this subject, very answerable to so important a design; a Subject, indeed, which gave me the greater pleasure and satisfaction in my own reflection upon it, be∣cause, whilst it but Teaches and Instructs [many of us, the meaner Servants of the Altar] it seems only to be a fairer Description of your Self. I know not what reception this plain Sermon may meet withal from some in the world; but, if any shall please themselves, in making me an example of their Contempt and Derision, for being so dull in my Endea∣vours, for the awakening others, to their being better ex∣amples in their Lives; I shall take the same liberty again, to please my self in my own private sense and Reflections, with what sober and sincere ends, I first gave this Discourse (such as it is) from the Pulpit; and now, have, (not with∣out your Lordships own signal approbation) given it to the Press, which, indeed, I have done (next to the ho∣nour of God, and the hopes, at least, of some small additions to the publick good) from no greater motive, or inclination, than to profess and acknowledge my self, not only within the sphere of your Lordships own Diocess, but, to the whole world, how much I really am,

October 14th. 1670.
