MY LORD,
SInce I had the Ho∣nor to know your Lordship I have not been in Pain to Whom I should Dedi∣cate this Treatise, no Per∣son being more Eminent to

Whom I might with less so∣licitation, or more Huma∣nity approach than to your Lordship, Who hath that Felicity in your Nature as not to make Retiredness One of the Essentials of your Greatness, but being clothed with Virtue dare own her Natives as Allies and Acquaintance.
Hence I have presumed to Entrust (under your Au∣spicious Name) These e∣minent Persons to Posteri∣ty, that They (being war∣med by your Aspect) may survive the Assaults and In∣juries of Time and Oblivion.
Nor will it be otherwise than Justice in You to own Them; for besides their Heroickness and Vertue, (Qualities inherent to the Birth) the Catalogue affords some from whose Loins you are immediately descen∣ded, so as in your own Per∣son to fulfil what They were but Types and Shadows of.
Besides the Interest of England much appears in the series of this Discourse; and I know none to whom it is dearer, or more entire than your self, having made Religion and Allegiance the Pillars of your Family,

though your Repose keeps you from the Fume as the Envy of the Court.
But that I may not wan∣der from the great Motive, I must yet say my Obliga∣tions to your Lordship, en∣joins this Address, that a∣mongst those Testimonies which the grateful pay, This may remain an ac∣knowledgment of his De∣voir, who is
My Lord
