RIGHT HONOURABLE,
IT may be wondred at by many, and censured by some, that I to your Lordship so very a stranger, should be so bold as to presume this De∣dication; and your Honour may perhaps account it as strange, if
not rash, that without pre-ac∣quainting your Lordship, I should so venturously undertake to do it. The wonder and censure of others I shall let pass, as not esteeming either the applause or censure of the vulgar, which is as uncertain and as changeable as the winde: But for your Lordships dissatis∣faction, which I only imagine may be caused by this Dedication, from him who is meerly a stran∣ger to your Honour; for remo∣ving of that, let me only crave your Lordships patience, and I doubt not, but to give such ra∣tional excuses of this presumpti∣on, as may reconcile your Ho∣nours (not offended, but perhaps somewhat amused) thoughts, to∣ward
your unknown, but cordial∣ly honouring servant.
First therefore let me assure your Lordship, that it was not my own motion, that incited me to present your Honour with this Tractate, (although the worth thereof may deserve an honourable Patron) for I was sensible what boldness it might be esteemed, for me so unknown to your Honour, to dare to engage (as I may say) your Lordship in my quarrel, by calling on your Honour to patro∣nize a Polemical discourse; on which ground, and for which reason I intended to let it pass without any Dedication, till at length I was perswaded, by a good friend, one in command at present
in the Army, to do what here I undertake, be convinced by his so∣lid arguments of the conveniency of the same.
Among which Arguments the most commanding was, when he upon his knowledge of your Lord∣ships inclination, having been long acquainted with your Honour, as∣sured me how great a lover of Ingenuity and Art he had ever known you, and by reason of your accomplished parts, how compe∣tent and able a Judge of the same: which was an unanswerable in∣ducement to me, to take the bold∣ness of presenting this to your Lordship, as to an able person to censure the same according to its worth and deserts.

Hereby (Right honourable Sir) I shall give a greater lustre to the truth for which I contend, when I submit and prostrate what I have done, to yours Honours judge∣ment for censure, and at your feet for patronage; confiding so to the truth of what I have written, as to assure my self, and promise your Honour such a foster childe, as will never shame its Patron; and doubt not, but so long as the Art of Medicine shall continue in esteem, which will alwaies be, so long as it is of use, this short dis∣course will live with credit, and where-ever it is preserved or kept, there it will make mention of your Honours worth and desert, and will prove a more clear and lasting
monument, then any statue of brass or Marble. For, My Lord, I am past doubt assured, that this small Treatise will be in esteem not in England only, but in other Na∣tions, as being drawn out of the fountain of most undoubted expe∣rience: in which though I am se∣vere in reproving common abuses, yet is it not without cause, as if your Lordships most weighty af∣fairs will permit you so much lei∣sure, as to look into the Epistle following, and the Book it self, you will see most evidently.
'Tis not (my Lord) all our Do∣ctors (but only such as are so qua∣lified, according to what I re∣prove) that I tax, and seek to re∣claim; for several among them
(to my knowledge) are Chymically given, as namely Doctor Ridge∣ly, Dr. Gurdane, Dr. Goddard of Oxford, Dr. French, Dr. Bathursts, Dr. Currar, and ma∣ny others, who have chosen the Chymical for the true way, and would wholly reject the other, were they but (Arcanorum A∣depti) Masters of those secrets which are taught and prepara∣ble by true Pyrotechny, after which they seek seriously and se∣dulously: only some thinking all Art with them already, defend their Method, against their know∣ledge and conscience.
My Lord, who can be a fitter person for this Dedication then your self? whose office cals upon
you, and whose power enables you to minde these things here within your Honours Jurisdiction, whose vigilancy and care in your place hath been already eminent in re∣forming several abuses in this Ci∣ty, which by being so long un∣disturbed, could almost have clai∣med prescription, (were it not that what is unrighteous cannot claim prescription) but the subject of my ensuing discourse is a discovery not of an abuse of selling Beer, for which if a man give a halfpenny too much, he is only so much the poorer, and that is all, but it con∣cernes the precious life of thou∣sands, and their health, a thing so much beyond estate, that skin for skin, nay all the world (if a man
had it) oft times would he give for to save the same.
This as it is of high concern∣ment to the sick, so ought it to be the principal care of the Magi∣strate to see that nothing be main∣tained under colour of Law, that may really prejudice, and indan∣ger the life and health of any. In vain are men secured from injury done to their goods, estate, credit, and liberty, while the most pre∣cious of all, their lives, are mono∣polized, and by colour of Patent, bought and sold. Our Doctors, (I mean the major part of them) maintain a method of medicine, which I impugn; the Controversie concernes the way of restoring dis∣eases safely, speedily, and certain∣ly,
in which your Honour, as a chief Magistrate, is nearly concerned; in vain are theeves and enemies provided against, if a Method be by authority confirmed and defen∣ded, which is of more dangerous consequence as to killing of many actually and immediately, of more by not restoring such diseases, which may easily be restored, were but the right way of Medicine allowed and incouraged.
What their Method performes is obvious to, and the by-word of the veriest rusticks in the Nation, and the reason why more cannot be expected from that Method, is be∣cause it is erroneous and defective, dangerous and impotent, partly lame and ridiculous, partly la∣mentable
and desperate: To this Method as a remedy of its de∣fects, I have opposed the way of curing and restoring diseases by powerful Medicaments, which are adaequate remedies to the causes of the same, and have hazarded the cause in hand, and my re∣putation on the trial, if they dare to take me up: But I expect a more churlish answer (by club, or fist Arguments) that they will endevour to suppresse what they cannot overcome, against which violence I humbly entreat your Honours interposition, in lieu of whose protection, in what on∣ly is just, and Christian, I pro∣mise that if they will contend with me,
I will ingage on these grounds, That whatsoever they shall agree to give me for every Cure, I will forfeit twice as much for every one not cured in the time agreed on; that is, in all Feavers con∣tinual, Fluxes, and Pleuresies, in four daies; in Agues (not Hye∣mal quartanes) in four fits, in Hecticks and Chronical diseases in thirty (at most forty) daies, (now under continual Feavers I comprehend Calentures, small Pox, Measles, &c. which are of that head) provided they will be upon the same lay with me in as many Patients as I have for my share, which let them be divided by tens, they to divde one ten,
and I another, and alway the divider to have the five Pati∣ents which the chooser leaves; I will engage to perform all my cures without bloud-letting, pur∣ging by any promiscuous Purge, or vomiting by any promiscuous Vomit, that is, which will work on all indifferently sick or no, without Vesication, or Cautery, without making any issue, or curious rules of diet, without Clyster or Suppository; and let them perform their cures how they can, by choosing one or more (nomine omnium) to maintain the contest; and if I wave the combate on these terms, let me be suspended from ever
practising as a vain-glorious boa∣ster, and if they win of me, I will recant my opinion with the greatest both solemnity and ignomi∣ny they can devise to enjoyn me to.
This as a tryal of Art or skill is the true Touchstone by which I shall stand or fall if they please, but I fear they will not en∣gage, some of them knowing that by my Medicaments (besides my own practise) one in Town here cures more annually, then any of their Colledge, the man a known man for honesty and Re∣ligion, and several others both in this City and the Countrey, whom I can call for testimonies of
the safety and efficacy of these e Pyrotechnical remedies, who  my directions cure many ely and certainly, seldome mis∣g the final cure, ever giving e, unlesse the ficklenesse of  Patient, or his extreme akness before administration nder the same; but I fear to  too troublesome to your Lord∣ip, whose serious affairs will se permit you leisure to per∣ a tedious Dedication: which ture consideration cals me off  time, and commands me to ke excuse for being already I fear) too long, only I be∣ch with your pardon your ac∣ptance of this small present, as
an acknowledgement of your Ho∣nours worth and virtue, and an expression of that esteem which he hath of your Lordship, who is,
My Lord,
