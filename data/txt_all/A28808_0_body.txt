MADAM!
SInce the most weak, ought to
endeavour the most power∣ful
Defenders; I could no
where elect a person whose
Accomplishments renders
them so capable to that requisite, as your
Ladyship: Which Motive I onely have
to hope and plead my Pardon by, for my
Presumption in imploring your Protection.

Madam, This earthy effect of my ignorant
Brain, you will find an Engin, which will
give all your Perfections and Virtues em∣ployment
in the most eminent degree; since
it not only requires your unequal'd Eloquence
and Wisdom, to appose the Censuring world,
upon this uncommon action in my Sex: but
your Goodness to pardon the many and high
defects, which you will there find to con∣demn.
Sinners look not upon their own weak me∣rits,
but Heavens Bounty, when they im∣plore
Benefits: For if they should turn
their Eyes to their inward View, and regu∣late
their Petitions by their Deservings;
they would blush and grow dumb to all Re∣quests.
This Line, Madam, I must draw
to my own Center; who must wholly ow all
your transcending Favours, to your generous
aud noble Humour, which makes the World
your Admirers, and fixes unalterably to the
power of your Commands,
