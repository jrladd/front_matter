My Lord,
BEsides the common ene∣mies to all these Paper∣adventures, Those who suppose they can do much better; and such who are not pleased they have not done so well: from a twofold sort of Men I expect a severe reflection upon this undertaking; chiefly from those who make it their business to reject all Religion in gross as a thing no where Existing but in the Minds of sequacious and fearful Men, and deride all attempts made towards its rational justification:
And also from them, who suppose things of this nature, priviledged from all di∣spute or debate, things not to be proved but admitted, that all endeavours of this kind, are but an open arraignment of such Fundamentals as ought not to be question'd, a disservice done to the cause of Religion thereby, and at best in them∣selves but useless and impertinent.
The following discourse (My Lord,) as it is in its nature no way condited to the gust of any such men on either hand; so I must needs acknowledge my self to be best pleased with whatever is least so: The first are an absurd Generation, that by an empty prophane sort of discourse, which themselves call Wit, would fain Hector us out of the wisest and best part of the world, make that the scorn of this Age, which hath been the most valu'd and most reverene'd in all others; And whenever reduced to any sober and rati∣onal contest, have no other relief from
the shame of their own folly, then what they find in those naked shelters of igno∣rance and confidence: Irreligion 'tis true in its practice hath been still the compa∣nion of every Age, but its open and pub∣lick defence seems the peculiar of this; 'Tis but of late that men come to defend ill living, and secure themselves against their own guilt, by an open defyance to all the great maxims of Piety and Virtue; 'Tis but of late the world hath been told, That the notion of a Spirit implies a contradiction; That the Bible is no where in force as a Law Divine, but where by Laws civil and municipal 'tis made so to be; That Religion is no∣thing else but a fear of invisible powers feign'd in the Mind, and fancyed from tales publickly allowed; These and most of the bad Principles of this Age are of no earlier a date then one very ill Book, are indeed but the spawn of the Levia∣than: The other are a sort of easie and
credulous men, that derive their Reli∣gion no higher then Education & Custom, have taken up their greatest concerns up∣on trust, and whensoever encounter'd but by any small artificer in the Scepticks, are sure to be sufficiently baffled, Them∣selves and Religion exposed to the utmost contempt; And upon all such attack's, they either go off wounded with a secret dislike of their own Profession, or oblige themselves to a stubborn and bruitish sort of drudgery, to believe that for which they find they are able to give no good reason: Would such dull men once be at leisure from doing nothing; would they once be persuaded to make but a salley in∣to the exercise of their own Reason, 'twere no hard task to convince them, that nothing proves more fatal to the pub∣lick good of Religion, then this stupid sort of credulity; 'Tis from hence, and from that weak impotent defense of the most eminent Truths, that results natu∣rally
from it, that Mens prophane Tri∣umphs have been chiefly erected; 'Tis from hence that we hear of so many, so easily, and so often seduced; And 'tis those Ages when Men fell off and retir'd from the rational proof of Reli∣gion, and sunk into implicite Belief, and ignorant Devotion, from whence we may date most of the great ills of Ido∣latry and Superstition, and from whence all those devout fooleries, which have since so cumber'd the world, had their chiefest and first rise: As the whole of Religion is declared to be a reason∣able Service, and can be no other, so all the Principles of it in order to its so being, must upon rational grounds ne∣cessarily be establish'd, what ever Belief is built upon the credit of any Revela∣tion, ought to be ultimately resolved into a rational proof of that Revelation as such, and what ever appears to us upon those terms so to be, whatever can be
sufficiently proved to be revealed to us from God, from the Soveraign Power of its Author, puts in but a reasonable claim to our assent, though the matter of it in some things exceed the bounds of a humane capacity; And herein it is the Socinians (who had they confin'd themselves to a rational proof that all we believe is revea∣led, had been of very good use to the Church) have greatly miscarryed, and when they would need subject all the mat∣tr of Revelation to a rational comprehen∣sion, fell much short of that credt ought to be given to all that God reveals, fell foul upon those two Fundamentals of our Religion, the Union of the two Natures, and that of the Trinity, and indeed have come much short of that Reverence all Nations have paid to their Gods, who by all their Mysteries still have professed to believe some things upon the score of Di∣vine Credit, which by their own Reason they could not fully comprehend.

Were not the loose Principles, My Lord, of this degenerate Age, about the most Essential parts of Religion, some∣what more than a sufficient Apology, for whatever is done this way; yet me thinks we can never inculcate too much, even unto the best men upon this Subject, and that upon these two Grounds; First, because 'tis from this Book, we derive all the certain notions we have of ano∣ther, and a farther World, and the great account of all invisible things; and Secondly because 'tis the highest Mo∣tive we have to all good living; 'tis from hence, from the authority of this Book, that we are chiefly obliged to all that is holy and good, and engaged against all the corrupt prastises of humane Life, when we consider with what difficulty we attain in the first Case to a fixed and unshaken belief of such things as we do not actu∣ally see, and how apt we are in the lat∣ter to decline from the strict Rules
of a good life, nothing can seem more necessary then a rational insurance about the great Foundation of all Belief and Practice in both.
That with a perfect security to our present and future welfare, we may rely upon this Book, as that great and only Revelation, by which God will in∣form, rule, and judge the world; I have hereby attempted to make evident, not only from its own excellent nature and composure, and such visible and open effects of a supreme and almighty power as accompanyed its first Publication, and lasted till the Church was so far built, that the Scaffolding might be safely taken down; but also from many other considerations, from whence an abun∣dant testimony to its Divinity will ap∣pear to result: And this task if suf∣ficiently perform'd as 'twill give an∣swer to all reasonable doubts, and cast a just contempt upon all prophane reproa∣ches;
so it will also reflect much upon those,, who though they acknowledge this Book to come from God, yet not acquiessing singly in the conduct thereof, declare it thereby insufficient to those great ends for which it appears to be in∣tended; and such are those of the Ro∣man Church on the one hand, and all sorts of Enthusiasts on the other, who by a twofold superfoetation, that of end∣less Traditions, and that of new and continued Revelations, have rendred the whole Scriptures, if not useless, Yet as to their great end and design, altoge∣ther deficient and imperfect.
My Lord, I seek not by this Dedi∣cation to countenance a defence of the Bible, nor any way to secure my self against the just reproach of an ill per∣formance; the first would engage me in an open affront to a Christian State; and the other oblige me to be too injurious to You, and that Candor and love to
Truth you possess; 'Tis alone that great Honour, and that entire affection I have for Your Lordship, that Interests Your Name in this matter, though there is nothing less needed by You than discourses of this nature, Yet there is nothing more due from me, then an open and publick profession that my self, and what ever I do, is devoted to Your Service. I know my Lord, into what hands I commit these Papers, when I present them to You, that great hazard to which they are exposed by your first view, will sufficiently inure them to all future dangers; I consider that Judgement with which they are put to encounter, and want not a due sense what the, suc∣cess must needs be: I know also your remedying kindness, and am enough secur'd thereby, am in this case upon the same terms of relief, that he was that discoursed before Caesar, who thus address'd to him, Qui apud te Caesar
audent dicere, magnitudinem tuam ignorant, qui non audent, humani∣tatem; My Lord, as You were pleased before to allow that Method I used in discovering the Unreasonableness of Atheism; So I promise my self some acceptance in the account I now give You of the Reasonableness of Scripture Belief, as I know no better Property can be convey'd to the World, then a Rati∣onal Possession of God and his Word; So I am also much pleased that I have spent some part of my time in doing what You required, To whom I owe all that is due to the most Generous, and most lasting Friendship, and shall ever be as much as I can be, which is but what I ought to be,
My Lord,
