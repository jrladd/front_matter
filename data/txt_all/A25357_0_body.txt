MY LORD,
THE actings of Providence are no less various than unsearchable, and it is both a pleasant and pious Employment to observe and meditate on Gods miraculous proceedings with Mankind. For Provi∣dential Dispensations are discoveries of the Wisdom and Goodness of God in disposing of the conditions of his Peo∣ple, whereby they may best glorifie him in whatever be∣falls them in this Temporal Life; because a true Christi∣an

does as seriously study the Celestial Sphere and occur∣rences of Divine Providence, as others do the Terrestrial Globe of this Corruptible Earth. And since it has pleased Almighty God to speak to this Nation and King∣dom by the Messenger of Death, in taking to his infi∣nite Mercy our late Gracious Soveraign King Charles, it must be acknowledg'd the bounty of a Divine Hand, and we are bound to adore the Wisdom and Benignity of Heaven, as S.

Though the gain be his, yet the loss is ours; for when a good Prince dies, a general damp and consternation seises the hearts of all Loyal Subjects, because publick Calamity charges every Man with a rate of sorrow proportionable to the tenure of his understanding; and the Memory of his late Majesty may justly oblige all his People to an ex∣cess of Tears as a signal of grief, and Your Lordship comes in as a Chief Mourner, who has had the Emanati∣ons of his Royal Favour, which incourages my confidence to implore Your Lordships Patronage: whereunto if you will vouchsafe to give the least approbation, I shall not despair of the more favourable Censures of others; and therefore it intreats Your Candid Interpretation and

Acceptance of these Dedicatory Lines, as a sincere Testimony of my Duty. And that Your Lordship would be pleased to place me in the number of those that honour Your true Worth, not only as to Episcopal Jurisdiction in∣specting the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made You Overseer, but also to Your Bounty and Liberality, which sounds as far as your Name▪ and displays the Ensign of Your Dignity, worthy of dou∣ble Honour: for Your Generous and Brave Mind, al▪ must needs acknowledge and pay You Homage and Obei∣sance, as Joseph's Brethren did to him, with the great∣est Veneration; in which respect (my most honoured Di∣ocesan) I am no less than
