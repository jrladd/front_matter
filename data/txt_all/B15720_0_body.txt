MAdam, your friends send you Iewelles, your tenants, the fruit of their store, & your seruants many good wishes, all of them, in their kinde, being testimoâˆ£nies of their loues and dueties: I that am too poore, to present you with the two former; and too ambitious, to supply my wants with the latter, haue presumed, in an other manner to expresse my humilitie, sending you, not the riches of my exterior fortunes, but the fruite and issue of my braine, in the begetting whereof, I wasted much pretious time. Your Honor, in accepting it, shall expresse more true bounty, then I, in writing, can expresse duety, though it be all the scope I leuell at. The Lord haue you in his protection, and send you many happy New-yeeres.
