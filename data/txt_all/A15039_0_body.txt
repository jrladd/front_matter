RIght Honorable, and worthie Maiestrates: Among the Lear∣ned, ther is a by Prouerb, ORPHEVS can describe Hell, better then ARI∣STOTLE: raised vpon a Fable, that he fetched his Wife from thence: which is none other, then a confir∣mation, of the sound Reason of PLAVTVS: That, Of more validitie, is the sight of one eye, then the at∣tention of ten eares: for, in that a man seeth, is Assu∣rance, and in that he heareth, may be Error.
Right Honorable, and Reuerent, I vse this EXOR∣DIVM, to take away the Contempt, which, the plain Discouerie of my MIROVR may breede, that make so sharp a Declaration of Vices, as if they raigned with∣out Chastisement? And do I, with the Deformytie of Rome, reformed, by Addition, entreate of Abuses? or more, of daingerous Mischiefes, incloased in the Bow∣elles of this famous Cittie? I doo: and do acknowledg withall, that you are Iudges of offenders, within your limittes, and with the Scourdge of Lawe, you chasten them, or with the Swoorde of Iustice, do cutte them short, as you finde them: as you finde them, I saye: E∣al-be-it,
 by the testimonie of Holy writ, both you, and all principal Magestrates, haue on Earth, the names and places of Goddes: yet with your fauours, in your, and their Iudgementes, are (often) showen the Infyrmyties of men: your sightes are not invisible, and (therfore) ne∣cessarie, that you haue visible Lightes, in obscure Cor∣ners. A Physition, can not see euery secrete griefe, but vpon Reuealement, may applie a curable Medicine for a hidden Discease: Euen-so, many can discouer the Mis∣chiefe, the Magestrate seeth not: but the Magestrate (a∣lone, must remedie the same. And where (say you) haue I knowledge, of these concealed Abuses? Forsoothe, In Hell: where al sinne and Iniquitie, is as appa∣rant, as Godlinesse & Vertue is in Heauen, cōmon.
Mee seemeth, I here you answer: That smale is the Maruaile, if you come not there, to harken after Offen∣ders: when the sayng is: In Hel there is no Redemption.
In very trueth: If Custom haue not made you bold, ye could no sooner enter into the Common Dicinge Houses, or Hell, in, and about London: (So, I maye name them, by the Aucthoritie of CORNELIVS AGRIPPA, who saith: that, the Art was, first, de∣uised by the Deuil:) But, you wold imagin the Assem∣blye, dampned, and you, your selues in daunger, to bee presently destroyed: Gods vengeance is so greuouslye tempted: For, the Deuill can breathe out Iniquitie, no faster, then his Angelles, there assembled, outrage God with the horriblest blasphemies that may be imagined, and too damnable to be reported: What followeth there, wher this despight is done vnto the eternal God? Mary, no villanie, may be vnthought, nor vnwrough to preiudice men.

It is euery mannes Case, that hath care of his Poste∣rytie, to be Suters for Reformation: the euill, is of the Nature of the Oyle of Ieat, that consumeth the Mar∣row, & perisheth not the Bone. The Marow & strēgth of this happy Realme, I mean the Abilitie of the Gen∣tlemen, is much weakned and, almost wasted, by haun∣ting of these vngratious Houses: Yet, for that the Mis∣chiefes be not reprooued, the Remedies ar not applied:
Not so fewe, as three hundred Gentlemen, of liuing, are at this Day, more then halfe vndone, by the daun∣gerous frequenting of Dicing-houses: how many, here tofore, haue ben cleane suncke, would mooue pittie to nomber: And for the welfare of such as shall followe, it is highe time, the Corruption were purged: And as the nombers of Gentlemen, by this meanes decayed, are great: so, the nombers of those that liue like Gentle∣men vpon their spoyles, are greater: For, if the Shifters in & within the leuel of Lōdon, were, truely, mustered, I dare boldly say, they would amaze a Pettie Armye, I pray god, an easie incouragemēt, arme thē not to a ciuil Mischiefe: for if their forfeats were wel knowē, I fere, thei do acts as vētrus: but my meaning is, not to suspect or acuse any in particuler, although, ther be mani, yt too boldly offēd. I wish yt their Couerts wer discouered, & thē iustice wold soon find their faults, or repētāce, shew their amēdmēt. My Discouerie, being by your wis∣domes read, the lothsomnes of this Mischief can not but distemper your sences: and for your safeties, the Infecti∣on, I trust, shalbe speedely purged: And in this comon benefite, this glorious Monument shall remain of your godly Trauayles.
London, as she is the Honor of her Countrey:
So, is she become the liuely Example of vertue.

If this Saiynge, bee written vppon her Gates, and A Whyp and a Halter the Signe of a Dicinghouse: Vnthriftes and their Familiars, would, quickly, liue in other Corners, It is (almost) incredible, what beastly estate, HELIOGABALVS, left Rome: as great a wonder, how soone his good Successor ALEXAN∣DER, repayred her Ruines: A Briefe of bothe, whose Gouernments, I haue set down in the beginning of this Treatise, to showe, how mightie sinne will grow with a little lybertie: and how soone, it is quailed with seuere Correction.
We haue the Image of Vertue, too our Soueraigne Queene ELIZABETH: the Sages of ATHENS, to her most Honorable priuie Counsell: graue Iudges in iuditiall places, and worthie Maiestrates, to examine Offences: by Gods and whose prouidence, our Prospe∣rytie, is so famous, as all the worlde enuie and feare vs. How great a foile, weare it then, that we shuld deuoure one another, when, of our superfluytie, many a hungry Nation is satisfied.
The prudent Maiestrates, haue alredie looked into our lasciuious inclinatiō: & haue enacted Medicineable Lawes, for these Infirmyties: But the seuerest Lawes, are not other, then written threatninges, without Exe∣cution, of whose vengeance, all men may heare and no man doth feele. In times past, a Proclamation, would keepe men in awe: and nowe, an Example of Iustice, scarse, makes the wicked to chaunge countenaunce: but althouge, a Braynsicke Iade, wyll ronne with a Snaffle, a sharpe Bitte wyll bridle him: though an Offender do iest to here a Penall Statute proclaymed, and say: tush, the effect of this, will be soone forgotten: yet, in the
 meanewile, scowrge him with the paine, and hee will crie, Peccaui.
To reforme the inconueniences Embleamed in this Myrrour, neede neither Machauils Pollycies, nor new Sessions of Parliament: The Remedies are alredie established, and Administration, will soone worke a∣mendment: Reformation belongeth to the Magistrate although, the benefite be generall: I (onely) of Zeale, discouer vnsufferable faultes, but deale not with faultie men, whom I referre to publique Iustice: And too your Censures I present my Trauayle, and at Com∣maundement, my selfe: Vowinge, in Actions of a true Subiect, to seeke the Honour of this famous Ci∣tie: to showe my selfe worthy of my deceased father, who liued longe in good Credit amonge you, and be∣yng dead, is registred for a good man: no more, but ac∣complishment of perfect desires,
