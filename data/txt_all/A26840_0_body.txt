SIR,
TRUE Gratitude abhors the prostitute forms of Verbal thanks, as a Ver∣tuous Lady the dress of a Curtezan; And since men practise the Art to make false Glosses on the Text of their thoughts, to personate Gratitude, and render these words meer Colours of ordinary Civili∣ty

and Complements to fill up the vacuity of discourse; which in the first use, were faithful interpreters of the affections they represented: since false tongues are as modeable as false Locks, and Grateful lan∣guage (like excellent fruit grafted on a Crabstock) usurped by those who take not any impression from the favours their speech pretends engraven in their hearts, which re∣main unaltered from their innate ingratitude, as the Crab-root re∣tains his sowre nature, though his boughs are adorned with Golden Apples. Since men have learnt to give thanks by Rote, as Parrots do Goodmorrows; To reduce the ex∣pression of Gratitude to lip-labour, is to offer Sacrifice on a polluted Altar; to prophane that which is holy, and to pay a debt in brass mo∣ney, which may have the stamp, but not the value of currant Coyn.

Large professions of thankfulness having by general abuse degene∣rated into pure impostures and viz∣zards of hypocrisie, or (at best) empty sounds, which naturally inferr the hollowness of the Vessell they proceed from.
My obligations to you are many and great; Justice returns quid pro quo, something equivolent to what is received; but Gratitude obliges reddere cum foenore; a Duty I am so far from being Capable to satisfie, that I confess my self Bankrupt by your favours: and for laying out kindnesses where they were not de∣served, nor can be requited, you might have repented your self of ill husbandry, equall to his, who sowed Wheat on the sands; But that bounty to an undeserving per∣son, resembles so nearly that Ar∣chetype of Goodness, whereby Pro∣vidence obliges the Universe with∣out

its merit; that my want of de∣sert, and disability of retribution, will intitle your beneficence the more Divine; and be Arguments of your Prudence, in doing good for Ends whereof you cannot be dis∣appointed: that is, like Solomon's Good Man, of being satisfied from your self; a design not to be fru∣strated: and carries in it the Com∣fort of being Conformable to his Precept, who Commands to give without hope to receive again.
—Licet exemplis, in parvis, Grandibus uti.
It was the saying of a great man Roan Iesuis, Roy Ie ne puis, Prince Ie desdayne: To apply it to the pre∣sent purpose. Your Favours, Sir, I am heartily thankfull for; actu∣ally to requite them is beyond my power; And (though I do not scorn verball acknowledgements,

yet, I ever thought words (which are but wind) as unfit representa∣tives of the deep Characters of Gratefull thoughts, as ordinary Table-Books, or Chartae deletiles, to hold matters of record. And con∣ceived it proper to transcribe the impressions my heart hath taken from your favours, into Mo∣numents that may remain to perpetuity; and not only pro∣claim to the present Age, but transmit to posterity a publick te∣stimony of your Goodness in my Gratitude. And though herein I do no more than the insolvent per∣son, who by the writing he owns himself a debtor, publishes only his obligation and disability to pay: Yet the freeness of those favours whereby you have engaged me, makes me confident of your ac∣ceptance of this address, as my de∣claration in Print of the duties I





owe you; and particularly my ob∣ligations for the opportunities had for this Translation of the Life of Ximenes: wherein if any Crudity ap∣pears, you will wink at it as a thing incident to the first fruits of mens Labours. This being such, and humbly presented to you, by him who is heartily as actually,
