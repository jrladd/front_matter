TO some of you were these Meditations lately preached; For all of you they are now Published. My Designe in both is, (that which should bee the Desire of every true Israelite) The Healing of the Brea∣ches in this our Israel. And my Hopes are that there is not a line within the Circumference of this Tract, which is not drawne dire∣ctly to this Center. If any shall thinke otherwise, let them mistrust

their owne eyes, which, being dazeled, will make the Sun-beames (though most direct in themsel∣ves) seeme distort, and crooked. Sure I am, what ever my lines may seeme to bee, my Intentions have beene right. These I can approve to God who knowes them, and the other (I trust) shall approve themselves to those who (being not prejudiced) are able to judge of them. If herein I fall short of my Marke, let it be enough I have aymed, and shot at it.
In magnis voluisse—
