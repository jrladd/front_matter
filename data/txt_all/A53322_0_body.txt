Right Worshipful,
HAd these been the Travels of some private Person,
I should have contented my self with a personal
Dedication thereof. But being the accompt of a
Solemn Embassy, sent to two of the greatest Prin∣ces
of Europe and Asia, upon so Publick and Noble a Design
as that of the Silk-Trade, carried on with vast charge and
many difficulties, for several years, the address of my En∣deavours
herein is most properly due to that Body of Mer∣chants,
to whom the advancement of our Trade into those
Parts is particularly recommended. It is not unknown to
you, what opposition this Negotiation met withall from the
several Parties therein concern'd; and consequently, you can
best judge, what advantages may be made thereof, in order
to the Interest of this Nation.
The Travels of particular Persons have their benefit and
delight; but those of Ambassadors have this further recom∣mendation,
that they contain such Discoveries, as having
been made to Them, out of a deference to their Publick and
Sacred Character, were not to be expected by any others, Tra∣velling
only upon a Private Accompt. They were first pub∣lished

by Adam Olearius, a Person, by his near Relation
to the Embassy, (whereof he was Secretary) his Know∣ledge
of the Mathematicks, but particularly his Acquaintance
with the Languages of the Countries, through which they
Travell'd, perfectly accomplish'd for a Work of this Na∣ture.
What he writ of these Travels in his own Language, the
German, was so kindly receiv'd, that it soon after Travell'd
into several others, which gave some encouragement to the
endring of them into English; the more seasonably at this
time, in as much as this Kingdom, especially this City, begins
to disperse its Industrious Inhabitants, and spreads the Wings
of its Trade into the most remote Cantons of the World.
Which that it may do, till its Wealth at home, and Honour
abroad, be so highly improv'd, as that this Corner of the V∣niverse
may give Laws to the Noblest parts thereof, shall be
the constant and earnest wish of,
Right Worshipful,
