TO You, and to Yee
three alone (Right
Honorable, and right
Worshipfull) prime
Guardians of this his
Majesties Impe∣riall
Chamber, am
I bold to commend these ensuing Lines
(Prosopopaeia) of the Lamentations
and Teares of this whilome flourishing, now
forlorne Citie: the which I (whoever I

am, an vnworthy member of the said Ci∣tie)
haue Compiled, not without many
salt Teares, and in the Meditaions of mine
owne Mortalitie; when as so many
Thousands haue falne, dayly and weeke∣ly,
on my Right hand and on my Left:
And what am I (a seely Worme and no
Man) that should bee left aliue, amids
the Thousands that haue falne, to relate
the sad Story hereof? But, it is the Pro∣uidence
of GOD it so should bee: By him
Kings doe Reigne; and by him also sub∣ordinate
Magistrates doe Gouerne:
By him, I say, and by his especiall Pro∣uidence,
doubtlesse, You my Lord Maior,
and Yee Mr. Sheriffes, (all three Profes∣sours
of Religion) were Chosen and Sworne
for this Yeere; a Yeere full of fatall and
memorable Accidents; the ending of a
mightie and prudent King, the beginning
of a mightie and prodigious Plague,

besides the marriage of a mightie King,
and the setting forth of a mightie Na∣uy,)
such an one, as no Age, no Record,
no Chronicle ever mentioned the like, with∣in
this our faery Land, in this our famous
Citie: I pray GOD the Countrey and
whole Land doe not drinke of the same
Cup: Yea, Lord, if it bee thy will re∣moue
this Cup from this Citie, from this
Land.
So as, to this present Plague of Pesti∣lence,
all former Plagues were but pettie
ones, as I may say: This, to future Ages
and Historiographers must needs bee Ka∣lendred
the Great Plague. I must ac∣knowledge
also, that by GOD wee liue and
moue and haue our being: But, Right Ho∣norable,
and right Worshipfull, by your Re∣sidence
and religious Discipline, wee that
remaine in this desolate Citie haue liued

in greater safety: for had you not beene
with vs, wee had beene in danger to haue
had a further Plague added; our Throats
cut and to bee despoyled of our Goods, by
a certeine Rout of Rascals that continu∣ally
lie lurking and hunkering about this
Citie: as I haue further demonstrated in
the ensuing Treatise: For the which,
your indefatigable labour of Loue, Care,
and constant Residence, what should my
poore selfe say? but, for a farewell now
at your going forth, The blessing of him
that dwelt in the Bush bee with you
and yours evermore:
And so I humbly take my leaue
of your Honour and your
Worships.
