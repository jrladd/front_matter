THis short Discourse I offer you, in remembrance of my Care, to have you be delighted with your daily Labours; and withal, to raise up your thoughts from Earth to Heaven, to that God, who maketh his Sun to shine, and his Rain to fall upâˆ£on your Fields, and giveth you to eat the Labors of your hands with comfort. To his continued favor I daily commend you and yours.
