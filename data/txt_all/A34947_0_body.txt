SIR,
THIS Play was written by a Gentleman, (my
particular Friend) whose Affairs call'd him in∣to
his own Country just as 'twas Acted; and
having left the Publishing of it to my Care, I knew not
a Nobler way to discharge my Trust, than that of lay∣ing
the forsaken Infant at your Door, under whose Pa∣tronage
it may safely venture into the World. The Ho∣nour
of your House will guard it from the Assaults of
Criticks, and your Generosity (I hope) will allow it a
portion of your Esteem. Your Love to Musick is sin∣gularly
great, and your Skill confess'd by the best Ma∣sters
of the Age. 'Tis reasonably to be suppos'd then,
that you bear no small Affection to its elder Brother Po∣etry.
I'm not a Poet, Sir, and therefore won't offer to men∣tion
the Beauties, or excuse the Infirmities of this. But
since the Town has receiv'd it as good, it gave me
Courage to lay it at the feet of so great a Judge as your
self.
In this Dedication, Sir, I find an Happiness of which
every Man is conscious; I mean, Sir, I'm freed from the
necessity of flattering my Benefactor, and exposing my
own weakness. Your Virtues are already sufficiently

known, and your great Character exalts you above so
mean a want as my Praises. Besides, Sir, I'm no stran∣ger
to your Modesty. My business then is only to beg
your Pardon for this Presumption, and to make a pub∣lick
Acknowledgment of those many Favours I have re∣ceived
from you. I know this is not the way to ballance
'em, the Sum already exceeds my Stock, and I must of
necessity add to the Score, by begging the honour of
subscribing my self,
SIR,
Your much Obliged, and
Very humble Servant,
