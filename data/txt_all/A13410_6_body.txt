Right Honorable,
NVrst in the limits of your Lordly power,
I line, and therefore boldned to present
Vnto your view, this holy newes, this hower,
By Heauens King's gracious commandement,
Amarriage feast is gloriously begunne,
'Twixt Iacobs Daughter, and Ichouahs Sonne,
To call to't noble ghests there's many sent,
And I am one, and I am sent to you:
Right worthy Earle put on your ornament,
Such as may giue the Nuptiall day it due,
Your seate's prepar'd, deckt with victorious bayes,
And shall stand more yeares, then this world hath dayes,
My Lord I'm plac'd vpon the mount of peace,
To profit Syons friends and not to please
The reeling multitude, such as would ken,
The path to paesse to new Ierusalem,

I haue Commission to direct theretoo.
With all the remnants, I haue nought to doe:
Your honor of that body's a chiefe part,
Of which Christ Iesus is the supreame head;
Vnto your hand (therefore) withall my heart,
I offer this, praying your Honor read,
It is the word of truth, and doth afford,
The fairest gilding for your Prineely sword.
It is the latest Honor great men wish,
To leaue their memories in leaues of brasse,
Or let, or marble: this meere weaknesse is,
Because it shall consume, perish, and passe,
Away with ruining time; Therefore I giue
This frame to you, where in your fame shall liue,
Till men, and time, and English cease: giue mee
Your gracious count'nance, and I haue my fee.
