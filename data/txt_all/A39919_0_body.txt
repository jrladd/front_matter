May it please your Lordship,
THE Acceptance which this Catechi∣stical Exposition of mine, found with your Lordship in Manuscript, when I submitted it to your Ex∣amination a while since; and the encourage∣ment I then received from you to Print it: have emboldened me, now it is Printed, to prefix your Name to it in this Dedication. Wherein I once more lay it at your Lordships Feet, as the Person to whom I am most pro∣perly accountable for all the Doctrine which I Preach, or Publish within your Diocesse: as also, the most proper Judg, how far it is fit, if not to be encourag'd, yet to be tolerated, (as to publick use) in those Parts to which your Ju∣risdiction extends.

I humbly beg your Lordship's Pardon for this boldness: which I do in no sort doubt to obtain, when I consider with what a degree of conscientious Zeal your Lordship endeavours the Edification of the remotest parts of your Di∣ocesse, by your Personal Visitation of parti∣cular Churches each Lords Day, and Ex∣emplary Preaching and Administring Con∣firmation to them: Together with that emi∣nent goodness, candor, and humble Conde∣scension, which so highly recommends your Lord∣ships Government to all your Inferiour Cler∣gy, and in particular to my self, who am, affectionately
(My Lord)
