Dearest Mother,
I Esteemed it a great happiness, that I had the ho∣nour to have my New Birth from thy Womb, and to be suckled up from my Cradle with the sweet Milk of thy syncere Doctrine. And if thou be not ashamed of such a Son, next to my Christianity, I esteem it my greatest glory to have had such a Mo∣ther.
But I esteem it a greater happiness, that I had the Grace given me to stick to thee in thy adversity, and not to leave thee, nor to turn from following after thee, when thou wert turn'd from a Naomy into a Marah, and all thy beauty and pleasantness was chang∣ed into deformity and sorrow.
But O I esteem it my greatest happiness, that upon the turning of thy Captivity, and the recovering of thy pristine Beauty and Splendour, thou hast not cockered me with thy Smiles and Favours (Prosperity being of all estates the most dangerous Enemy unto Piety) but kept me under with thy Frowns and Cen∣sures, the Furnance of Affliction, always causing the Fire of Piety to burn the brighter.

And though the unkindness of Friends wound deep∣er than do the Swords of Enemies; yet as no opposi∣tion of Foe could, so no unkindness of Friend shall, divorce me from thee. And I am as unseparably devoted to thee, as Ruth was unto her Naomy; The Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but Death part thee and me. And I am immutably,
