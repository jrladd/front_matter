My Lord,
IT is (I confess) a great presumption to prefix your Lordships Name to so small a Treatise; but since the Design of it is to inform all true English Men of what Ways the Papists used in endeavour∣ing to bring their Religion into England, that they may be prevented in all their De∣signs; I hope your Lordship will pardon this boldness in me. And, my Lord, I believe the English Nation, have so great a Reverence for your Lordship, that they will the better e∣steem
this Piece for your Lordships Name be∣ing set before it; because they will imagine that none durst have presumed to have laid it at your Feet, unless it were agreeable to your Sentiments.
My Lord, I think nothing of this kind was ever yet printed, which was a great Mo∣tive to me to publish it; who am
My Lord,
