Honoured and Worthy Sir,
THE Generous Incouragement,
which you were pleas'd to
give to all my Auctions of
Books, and the Extraordinary and
Unmerited Kindnesses I receiv'd at
your Hands, when in Ireland, em∣bolden
me to trouble you with
this Dedication.
I confess it may justly seem un∣worthy
of the Acceptance of a Per∣son
of so Great Honour and Endow∣ments,
as you are known to be: Nor
can any thing less than your own
Goodness, find an Excuse for this
Presumption: But having had such
large Experience of the Excellency
of your Temper, and of the Great∣ness
of your Soul, I should be unjust

to your Character, if I did not pub∣lickly
own, that you measure the
Tokens of Gratitude by the Affecti∣on
of your Friend, and not by the
Value of the thing presented.
Give me leave then, Worthy Sir,
to inscribe your Name to the fol∣lowing
Sheets, as a Great Patron
of Learning, and a Generous Friend
to an injur'd Stranger, who came
to promote the Interest of Learning
in your Country.
The Kindness you were pleas'd
to Vouchsafeunto me, and the Con∣cern
you express'd for my Welfare, per∣swade
me that you will not dis∣dain
to be my Patron in defending
my self in Print in England, seeing
I could not have the opportunity
of doing it in Ireland.
I must indeed own that your Cha∣racter
and Courage Entitles you to be
the Champion of such as are enga∣ged
in a more Masculine Quarrel than
the Scuffle betwixt Patrick Campbel,

and my self. Yet you know Sir,
that the Greatest Captains, after
the Campaign is over, do sometimes
divert themselves by seeing a Mock∣fight
on the Stage. This, Sir, has
something more in it, as being a
real piece of Injustice first committed,
and then defended by my Adversa∣ry,
who has arm'd himself with
Impudence and Malice, and manages
his Attacks by Fraud and Forgery;
as I have made sufficiently clear in
the following Sheets.
I confess, Sir, the Entertainment
you will meet with here, is not
answerable to that Hospitable and
Generous Treatment I was honoured
with at your House; and that I am
not capable of gratifying your Cu∣riosity
with such excellent pieces
of my own drawing, as you were
pleased to feast my Eyes with, when
I beheld with wonder, the effects of
your happy Pencil! Yet, Sir, I dare
say, that I present you here with an

ORIGINAL; which, tho' drawn
by an unskilful Hand, has something
very surprizing in it; such Features,
such a mixture of Hypocrisie and double
dealing cover'd over with a false Varnish
of Religion, that I question much,
Whether Patrick may not pass for a
Iudas Redivivus? And were my
Pen able to keep pace with your
Pencil; or had I the Art of temper∣ing
my Colours, drawing the Fea∣tures
to the Life, and observing due
Proportion, I doubt very much,
Whether Africa could shew any such
Monster, as I should here present
to the publick View?
But, Worthy Sir, I must beg your
Pardon for daring to offend the Eye
of such a Curious Artist as your self,
with such a deformed piece. It
were indeed unpardonable, did I
not know that by one Glance of
the Eye upon your own Perfecti∣ons
and Eminent Vertues, you will
immediately race out those foul

Idea's which the fight of Patrick may
impress upon your Imagination.
Contraries expos'd to the View at one
and the same time, do mightily illustrate
one another; and therefore when you
see his Picture, and reflect upon your
own, you will find great Cause to
bless him who hath made the di∣stinction.
Pardon me Sir, I don't
think your Vertues need any such
foyl to set them off; for they are
such, as when compar'd with those
which render the Enjoyers of
them Amiable in the Eyes of Man∣kind,
will undoubtedly give you the
Preference amongst Thousands; but
I must break off, lest my Affection
should offer Violence to your Modesty;
and lest it should be said, I only
commend my self in extolling my Patron:
I must indeed own that the Honour
of your Friendship is one of those things
that I value my self most upon, and
esteem my self happy in some mea∣sure
by Patricks Enmity, which gives

me this Opportunity of letting the
World know, that Collonel Butler
is my Friend: Or, if that be a De∣gradation
to you, that you are an
Encourager of Learning, and a Pro∣tector
of those that Endeavour to
promote it.
I shall add no more, but beg your
Pardon for prefixing your Name to such
a Trifle. You know Sir, that how
meanly soever it be perform'd, it
was absolutely necessary for the de∣fence
of my Reputation, which Pa∣trick
Campbell has so unjustly endea∣vour'd
to destroy; and seeing it is
usual with Authors to attone for
their own Defects, by chusing an
Honourable Patron, I hope Sir, you
will indulge me the same Liberty.
May you Live long, to be an Orna∣ment
to your Country, and the Ob∣ject
of His highest Esteem, who is,
Honoured Sir,

London, Feb.
