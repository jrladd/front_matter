My Dearest Sister,
WHat I long since promised I now perform, if a thing imper∣fectly flubber'd over, and in hast, may merit

the name of a performance: but for that as I acknowledge the debt, so I look upon you as an easie Creditress, and not so scrupulous as to refuse pay∣ment, because it comes in clipt and broken money. 'Tis true, I have sometimes heretofore thought of it, but those thoughts perisht almost in the very conception without pro∣ducing any thing, unless it were some few rude lineaments, and which I should call the rough draught of this discourse, but that I should be injurious to it as it is now, by robbing the thing of its apellation; al∣though I am perswaded the conceptions concerning this

subject, being so exceeding fine, and having so little com∣merce with sense, are not to be exprest to the life by the most curious Pencil, much lesse by so uneven an hand as mine, but are like to those which Apelles is said to have drawn when he contended with Protogenes, Lineas visum effugientes: how∣ever deliniated, it is yours by a double relation; both because I know you to be (and me thinks there should be no one of so little humanity as not to be) a friend to lovers; and next be∣cause it is a task which I had not undertaken but upon your assignment, and so in both res∣pects most properly belonging

to you. For a conclusion, I wish you all the joys of Love, of Youth, and Health, and what ever Happinesse else is to be found in this World, and in the next, eternal and ever last∣ing Felicity.
