I Shall not here Sir, polish or repeat
The story of your worth, nor tell how great
You are in goodnesse as in fame; how immense
In your mindes faire Republique; how propense
Indulgent nature hath been of her store,
By enriching you, thus to make others poore:
These as essentiall Truths, I might infer,
From each Comma raise your Character;
But these soft layes I leave to such soft wits
Who teach their Muse the trade of Parasits,
To bombast easie greatnesse with, and please
Their pampared Patrons with Hyperboles.
My Muse weares no such masque, nor can her Rime
Lackey or hold opinion with the time.
Invited hither to performe that due
Tribute of thankes she owes, and owes to you;
To you best Sir, who have a witnesse been
Of what she writes, to you Sir, who have seene
Those Tragedies she treates of, and have knowne
The losses of great Ulster in your owne.
Then since she's thus aspired, she humbly prayes
To let her Ivie waite upon your Bayes.
