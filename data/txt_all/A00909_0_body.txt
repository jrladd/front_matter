KINDNES, saith the prouerbe, wil creepe where it can not goe; The meaning is, if I be not deceiued, that such is the force of loue and affection, that when it can not manifest it selfe so amply as it wold, it wil show it selfe in some sort as it may; the which is now verified in me; For, wheras I haue neuer hetherto had the meanes, & oportunity to manifest my affection towards you, by reason of my departure from you and my cuntry, in your infancy, & my continual ab∣sence euer since, (for the space of these three and twenty yeres) I can no longer forbeare to geue you some testimo∣ny of my loue, by the particular addresse of this treatise vnto you; For, although I intend it generally to al my cuntrymen, for the publyk good, yet I can not but wish the best part of the benefit to you, to whom the fruite of al my labours is most due, both by a special prerogatiue of nature, and also by the particular priuiledge of my owne desire, and your desert.
Therfore, to the end you may reape the benefit which I wish you of this treatise, you shal vnderstand, that al∣though part of the subject is policy, yet my meaning is not to animat you to the study, or practise therof, for that in my many yeres trauel, & seruice of forrayne princes, (wherin I haue obserued the successe of many, great
 negotiations, & bene my selfe emploied in some) I haue learned by experience, that the old prouerb, Of little med∣ling commeth great ease, is verified in nothing more then in matters of state; the practise wherof may wel be com∣pared to the vse of fire, which though it be most necessary for man, yet is most dangerous to deale with, and doth men some times irreparable dammages, be they neuer so circumspect. And this I say, for that I haue knowne very many stats-men of greate sufficiency, much perplexed, and diuers ruined, not so much by their owne inconside∣ration, as by the difficulties, and dangers incident to the handling of state-matters, which are subiect to infinit ac∣cidents, and hazards, impossible to be fore-seene and pre∣uented, by the witt, or industry of man; And therfore the only point of state, which I wold haue you to learne, or at least to practise, is, to serue God and your prince, with al duty and loyalty, yeelding (as our Sauiour com∣mandeth) To Caesar that vvhich is Caesars;Matth. 22. and to God, that vvhich is Gods: And euer to perswade your selfe, that ho∣nesty ioyned with piety, & prudent simplicity, is the hig∣hest and surest policy that may be: for as Salomon saith; Qui ambulat simpliciter,Pro. 10. ambulat confidenter, & qui deprauat vias suas manifestus erit. He vvhich vvalketh simply and plainly, vvalketh cōfidently & surely, & he that rūneth an vndirect course shal be made manifest. And this our Sauiour also taught his Apostles,Natth. 10. and vs al, when he said. Estote Prudentes sicut serpentes, & simplices sicut columba. Be you prudent like to the ser∣pent, and simple like to the doue; whereof I shal not neede to say more vnto you here, for that I haue sufficiently hādled this matter in this treatise, in the which I wold wish you for your better instructiō, to obserue specially these points following.
The first is; The natural imbecillity of mans wit; the
 consideration wherof is most necessary for euery man, to he end he may not only beware of presumption, and an uer-weening of his owne wit (the danger wherof I haue eclared in the first, and second Chapter) but also haue ecourse to the remedies which God hath ordained for ans infirmity; that is to say, continual praier to him for he light and helpe of his grace, and the councel of dis∣creete, and wise frends; of both which points I haue trea∣ed at large, partlie in the 28. Chapter, and partly in my ules for young statists; wherto I remit you.
The second obseruation which I wish you to make, is, of the course of Gods prouidence in the affaires of men, s how he disposeth not only of kingdomes and states, but lso of particular mens affaires, working his wil in them, nd by them, some times manifestlie, and some times y secret operation, permitting euil to the end to draw good therof, and seruing him selfe of mens wills, wits, olicies, and power, as also of al other his creatures, nd of al manner of causes, natural, moral, and ac∣idental, for the execution of his holly wil, and secret udgements; The consideration wherof infinitely im∣orteth euery Christian man, as wel for the discharge of is dutie towards God, as also for his owne special come∣ort, throughout the whole course of his life.
For he that alwaise hath the prouidence of God before is eyes, and acknowledgeth his merciful disposition in what soeuer befalleth him, is neither puffed vp with pride  prosperity, nor deiected with sorrow in aduersity, nor et dismayed with the apprehention of dangers, but al∣waise holdeth an euen and stedfast course, resigned to Gods wil, grateful for his benefits, not repining at his unishments, knowing that al wil turne to his good, if the ault be not in him selfe; whereby the seruants of God
 receiue infinit cōsolation, wheras those who haue not the like consideration of Gods prouidence, haue neither any stay of them selues in prosperity, nor any true comfort in aduersity, but being no lesse dissolute in the one, then des∣perate in the other, perish many tymes in both, through Gods iust Iudgement. And although you shal find matter considerable concerning this poynt, throughout this whole discourse, yet I specially recommende two Chap∣ters to your reading, to wit the 25. and 26. where I haue declared the causes why God permitteth good men to be afflicted, and wicked men to prosper in this world, which being wel waied may yeeld you, as I hope, both consola∣tion, and instruction.
The third poynt to be obserued is, the seuere Iustice of God in the punishment of sinne,Exod. 20. (Visiting the iniquityes of parents vpon the children vnto the 3. and 4. generation) which as I haue made most euident in princes, and their states, so may it also be obserued in priuate men, and particular families. Therfore the instruction, which I wold wish you to take by this point, is, that the true cause of the decay and ouerthrow of most families, is the same that I haue showed by euident examples to be the ruin of king∣domes, & states, to wit the sinnes of men, punished eyther in them selues, or in their children and posterity, wherby whole families are extirped, races extinguished, ancient houses decaied, and personnal defects, or imperfections, continued sometimes in families for many decents.
Wherby it may appeare, how simple they are, who hope to eternize their names and families, by wicked meanes, and how absurdly many men vse to saye, that he is happy whose father goeth to the deuil (because wicked men leaue many times their children rich, with il gotten goods) whereas experience teacheth, that although God of his
 secret Iudgements suffreth euil men to prosper for a while for such causes as I haue signified in the 26. Chapter) yet e punisheth them, and dissipateth their ill gathered sub∣ance sooner or later, wher vpon groweth the prouerbe: ale parta, male dilabuntur; Goods il gotten, are il spent. Et vix udebit tertius haeres; And they seeldome descend to the third neratiō. VVherfore we may say with far more reason, that e is vnhappy whose parents sinnes may drawe the male∣ction, & wrath of God vpon him; and that most happy he, who fearing God, and being descended of vertuous arents, enheriteth not only their wel gotten goods, but lso Gods blessing for their vertues; For such a one hath a sting stock, and an indeficient treasure, yeelding an as∣red fruite to him, & his; which I wish you alwayse to re∣ember, to the end you may liue in the feare of God, at it may please him to blesse you with his grace, and al mporal happines, yea and to prosper, and perpetuate our posterity, for his owne glory, and the good of your untry; For, Sic benedicetur qui timet Dominum;Psal. 127. So shal he be lessed who feareth God.
Furdermore you shal find in this treatise diuers political recepts, and rules, which though as I said before, I doe ot aduise you to practise, yet it can not hurt you to know, nd the rather for that many of them may be applyed to e condicion, or state of any particular man; such being e connexion of al the parts of prudence, (wherof po∣cy is one) that they concurre, and communicate in many ings, in so much that an aduise may be very political, r good for the administration of state, and withal very econnomical, or fit for the gouernment of houshold, yea nd necessary for the direction of any priuat man, in his articular affaires; of which kinde, diuers wil occurre nto you, in reading this treatise.

In like manner, whereas I haue interlaced many thing against Atheists, which you, and other good Christians, may perhaps omit to reade, as not pertaining any way to you, I think good to aduertise you, that you may also find therin matter woorth your consideration, for that I haue by the occasion of their obiections, cleared diuers douts, explicated many difficultyes, & decyded some notable questions; which may serue, not only for the confirma∣tion of our Christian fayth, but also for the edification of any good Christian reader, yea and stirre him vp to the admiration of Gods infinite wisdome, iustice, mercy bounty, & omnipotent power, and to the due reuerence, and feare of his inscrutable Iudgements.
Moreouer, hauing had desire both to delight, & profit my readers, I haue sowed in this my gardain (as I may tearme it) the seede as wel of moral, as of political doctrin, and haue watered it aboundantly with al kind of history, yea more perhaps then wil seeme conuenient to some cu∣rious and seuere censurers, who may desire to haue al things restrained to the limits of their lyking; Neuerthe∣lesse, I wold haue such to vnderstand if any such there be that I haue bene the more copious in examples, for the better and more cleare confutation of Macchiauillian, & Atheistical politikes, who referring al the effects of Gods secret Iudgements, yea and of many of their owne errours to chance, are best conuinced by experience, which is cheefely deduced from history, and showed best by multi∣tudes of examples.
Therfore I wold haue you to think that I inuite you to the reading of this treatise, as to a gardain, in the which I hope you shal find variety of faire flowers, and holsome hearbs; wherof I wish you first to take a ful view, & after to make your selfe a nosegay of what you like best, for I
 can not expect that you, or any other, wil like and allow, f euery thing alike, which I treate, or teach in this Trea∣tise, no more then it can be expected, that many guests in∣ited to a feast, be it neuer so wel furnished, shalbe al of hem contented alike with euery dish: and therfore euen s many dishes are prouided, not so much that al the guests ay eate of euery one, as that euery guest may haue some ish to his liking; euen so I haue proposed to my readers ariety of matter in this discourse, not so much hoping hat al of them wil be pleased with euery thing therin, as hat euery one of them may find some thing to content him
To conclude; I wold not haue you expect in this my Treatise, any curiosity of exquisit words, or fine filed phra∣es, or other ornaments of eloquence, because nether my declining yeares, (where with my stile is also declined) neither yet the grauity of the matter which I handle, doe seeme to me to permit any other then a plaine stile, and familiar manner of writing, accommodated to common capacity for the publike good; Besides that I perceiue by such english bookes, as I haue chanced to see, printed in England of late, that the english tongue is much altered since I came thence, and therfore I may wel feare, that the language currant in my time (which I am forst to vse because I neuer vsed, nor learned other) may now seeme no lesse barbarous to some men, then diuers new woords, nd phrases seeme strange to me; But howsoeuer it be, I hope my louing, and courteous cuntrimen, wil measure this my woork rather by the matter, and my good mea∣ning, then by the language, or manner of composition, and that for supplement of al defects, they wil accept the abundance of my good wil, and desire of their benefit, which hath moued me to take this paines, to treate of a
 necessary subiect, neuer handled before in our tongue, fo ought I know; In which respect I hope it may be the more grateful vnto them; And this being al which I haue thou∣ght needful to aduertise you touching the Treatise follo∣wing, I referre you to the preface for your further satisfa∣ction, concerning my further intention, as wel in this first part, as in the second, which by Gods grace shal follow in tyme, if God geue me lyfe and health; And in the meane whyle, I wish you al contentment, and the abundance of Gods grace, taking my leaue with this benediction of the Psalmist. Benedicat tibi Dominus ex Sion, & videas bona Hie∣rusalem omnibus diebus vitae tuae, & videas filios filiorum tuorum, pacem super Israel.
