RIght Noble, myne espe∣ciall trust is that your ho∣nor will pardon my bold∣nesse in dedicating this Booke to your honorable name. For when I had with some charge cased the same to be collected and tran∣slated out of sundry good authorities, and thought that it could not but generally de∣light all Noblemen and Gentlemen of this Realm. I made also diligent searche to knowe what particular personage were meetest to be presented with the same: and being enformed by my friend (the Tran∣slator)

that the office of the Hart Hoūds perteyned vnto youre Lordship, I thought it my duetie, and was glad that I shoulde thereby haue iust occasion to dedicate so noble an Arte vnto your honorable name, most humbly beseeching your honor to ac∣cept it in good part, and to be assured that whatsoeuer I coulde procure to be written of this excellent Arte of Venerie or Hun∣ting, either out of straunge Authors, or by conference of our countrey Huntsmen, is here in this Booke diligently and sensibly declared. I cā no more but present it with humble intente, and beseeche the fa∣ther of Heauē euermore to blesse your good Lordship with the spirite of his grace.
Amen.
