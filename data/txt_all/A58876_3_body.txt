MADAM,
AMongst all the remarkable expressions, in which Learned persons have endeavour'd to sum up the excellencies of History, I know not whether the invention of any was more happy, than his, who term'd it, The Image or Picture of Life, since it faithfully represents to our eye, all the variety and circumstances of humane actions, in which our life principally consists. But Histories are like Picture, either drawn according to the resemblance of some real example, or merely made out of the invention of the Writer. To which latter, as a greater measure of skill is requir'd, so the liberty the Designer's Fancy is left to, enables him to make a more exquisite and perfect Piece, than he could do, if he were confin'd to trace out the lineaments of some proposed pattern; as it is without doubt, possible for an Artist to pourtray a Piece of more exact symmetry and shape, than ever was framed by Nature. Nor ought it to seem strange, that I in general, give the pre∣eminence to these Modern fained Stories, above all true (I mean profane,) as well in reference to Profit as Delight. Those we have received from Anti∣quity, give us scarce more than Pourtraits halfe drawn; perhaps they repre∣sent to us a Consul, or some other great person in the Field, and possibly give us a little taste of his abilities in the Senate, but afford us very little know∣ledge, how generous his deportment was in conversation; and amongst his Friends, how nobly he loved or hated; and how tender a relation, or faithful friend, he shewed himself in all the diversities of adventures: All which, no question, are of great importance to the Reader's improvement and pleasure, to be handsomely describ'd.
The Piece, Madam, I humbly address to your Ladyship, was drawn by an approved Hand, the same that made Cyrus Great, and Ibrahim Illustrious; and which the most intelligent persons doubt not to commend for a Master-piece. I acknowledge it is but a part of a greater Work; yet the several Histories tran∣siently interwoven in the Grand one, are perfect in themselves; it being the cu∣stom of this incomparable Author, contrary to that of most others, to perform more than he promises in his Title. The main design is the relation of the ad∣ventures of an excellent Lady, and I could not do her greater justice upon her arrival into England, than to recommend her to the protection of one that is

so too: Which I have reason to be assur'd, will not be lookt upon as an expressi∣on of formal flattery, since as many as have the happiness to know you, esteem you a Lady of great goodness, prudence, and virtue; and since your excellent ac∣complishments are, notwithstanding the eminency of your quality, known to more than your person. The consideration of which, principally induc'd me to make this humble dedication, upon confidence, that amongst so many perfections, you could not be averse to pardon it; though I had together some motive of self∣interest, believing the rest of the Book would be more acceptable to the Rea∣ders, when they met with your name in the beginning of it; and that they would be more favourable to my faults, when they saw you had permitted me the honor to subscribe my self,
Madam,
