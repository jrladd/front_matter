My LORD,
REligious, and
Reall good∣nes
establish
Greatnes:
thout these Supporters,



Mole ruit sua. Let Vir∣tue
keepe Court within
and Honour will atten
the outward Man.
Clouds cannot long
obscure that Sunne which
moues directly. As Goodnes
make all men Honourable,
so it makes the
Conspicuous. Thos
whose Actions are pious,
will be Eminent i
Place, and Person. Th
firmest Basis for Honou
to mount upon, is Practicall
Virtue. Indirec
and Oblique Ascen

may be more speedy, and
early, but they are subiect
to sodaine, and certaine
Praecipices, those which
are Raisd upon Virtue
are durable, and perma∣nent.
Others may shine
sooner, but these surer, &
longer. Those are as bla∣zing
Meteors, these as
fixed Starres.
I know (my Lord) your
Intendments this way to be
Methodicall. So that
your Actions are warran∣table
directions to others,
and I in avouching your



Honour to bee truely
Noble, cannot Iustly b
censured for a Parasite.
The knowledge of this,
and the Experience of
your Honours Candide
disposition, giues me En∣couragement
to present my
Worke to your Tuition. I
know your Honours de∣light
is to bee a Lord
Protector of Virtuous
Endeavours. Comfort it
may be to you, disparage∣ment
it cannot be. It
showes your Affection to
Learning, and Religion,



truely preserves your Me∣mory
sacred to Posterity,
and giues courage to the
Heart of the Labourer,
even to future underta∣kings.
That ReverendL. Bb. of Exon. Fa∣ther
in our Church, first
began to enter this Path,
and sent his Labours to
the World for a patterne,
under the Protection of a
Right Honourable Pa∣tron.
His Exhortation
was my Incitation, I am
beholden to him for Me∣thod,
but the Matter was



mine owne. What is thus
mine by right of Composing,
I entreat your Honor
to make yours by way of
Patronage and Protection.
Thus your Honour, One
of the Worthies of Israel,
in our Salomons Court,
shall haue the Prayers of
him, who desires to be, and
is,
