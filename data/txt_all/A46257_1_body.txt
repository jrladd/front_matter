Gentlemen,
WIth as much Splendour, Magnitude, Variety, and Aptitude, as the brevity of my Limitations would allow for Designation, Direction, Composition, Correction, and Transcription, I have accom∣plished Your Commands in the punctual Performances of this Days Triumphs; wherein, although I have squared all my Inventions (ac∣cording to my ability) by the Rules of Art, I confess I have been more sedulous to indulge and oblige the Worthy Society and Ancient Com∣pany of DRAPERS (my Worshipful Patrons, by whom I am employed and gratified) than to humor the querulous dispositions of any private Observator whatsoever. This Show being Calculated for the Meridian of Cheapside, whose numerous Applause in the Publick will prove more prevalent to me than the nicer Investigations and peevish Censures of the most curiously currish Criticks. If any Person shall make Objection, that my Lines are home-spun, let him qualifie the qualms of his tender Judgment with a Consideration that my subject matter is Wool, Cloth, the Wealthy and Worthy English Drapers: In the Interim, I submit my Labours to your Judgments, and my Fortunes to Your Friendship, contented with the Honour of having permission to subscribe
Octob. 29. 1676.
Gentlemen,
