Right Honorable,
IT is a wonderfull love that the Lord hath ever carried to∣wards Man (passing by the faln Angels) not onely elect∣ing him before time, creating him in time, redeeming him in the fulnesse of time, and preparing glory for him after all time; but like∣wise in the manifestation of this his matchless love, dealing therein so indulgently, that he unfolds to us the highest mysteries that may be, for our consolati∣on, in the lowliest termes and resemblances that can be, for our instruction; stooping downe so to us that we may step up to him, and making earth to be (as it were) Heavens trenchman; and that con∣jugall chaste love that is between the bridegroom and bride, or the loving spouse and his dearely

beloved, to poynt and paint out in some measure that cordiall and matchlesse affection, that without measure Christ carries to his Church: so that the Lord demits himselfe so to our capacities, for our easier admission to his heavenly mysteries, that if sense have any power on the soul, the same can∣not want many constant instructers, as if things be∣low were made by divine providence, beyond their ordinary use or course, to speak out things above, and to be like the steps of that Ladder which Jacob saw at Bethel, by which from the earth the soul may mount to Heaven; or like that Vessel full of all variety which in a Vision was let down to Peter, that by things terrestriall the same may be instru∣cted in things that are celestial.
A cleere instance whereof we have in this no∣table Song of Songs, or sublime book of the Can∣ticles, wherein that great Lord and King of whom David speaks, Psalm. 45. and his glorious Spouse and Queen are to the life described, together with that mutual holy and chaste love which each one of them beares to another. The serious and san∣ctified meditation whereof as it requireth an ele∣vated and heavenly disposed mind: so it cannot likewise but ravish such a soul with spirituall ioy and comfort, and inflame the same with a holy fervour of heavenly affection, and a sutable care to expresse the same by a correspondent obedience of practicall action, to be wished as the disposition of all faithfull Christians, and for excitation where∣unto

I have taken these pains in unfolding (as the Lord has inabled me) the sublime Mysterie of this heavenly and mutuall intercourse of love, commu∣nion and communication between Christ Jesus and his bride or spouse, in her estate here by grace, till at last she come to the full and uninterrupted fruition of himselfe in glory, when all teares shall be wiped from her eyes, and she shall enjoy that ple∣nitude of ioy, and perpetuity of pleasures for ever, whereof the Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 16. 11. And which I shall wish to be the Lot of every faithfull Christian.
These paines then, which I have taken in the unfoldingof this great and sublime mysterie, I have dedicated to your honours: which as it is a Song of Love, so it may be a sign and signification of my Love and respect to yourselves, and to that place the most eminent Citie of our Kingdome, whose prosperity and dayly increase of all saving Knowledge, and believing on that blessed bride∣groom he described, and of your spirituall union with him as his beloved (wherein only stands true happinesse) shall be the heartie and earnest wish of
