My Lord,
I Have readd and readd again the ADAM of the most Ilustri∣ous Lord Gio: Francesco, with excessive delight. O what Witt▪ O what a happy hand he had! But it was necessary it should be no lesse, for the making of an Adam: nor is it fit that any one should write the life of the first Man, but one of the first Writers of the Age. The alteration of the style in some places hindred not, but that without seing the name of the Author, I should easily have known this Work for his. I hold it not fit that, be∣cause Adam used to cover himselfe with leaves, he should therfore be deckt in flowers. All dresses become not all matters a History extracted out of holy Writt, is not to be

trimmed like Playes, and Romances. Noble Loredano was desirous to give us not only the history, but together with it also the true manner of writing it. Doth your Lordship require my thought of it? Adam, in my opi∣nion, will receive no lesse grace from these lines, then from the ruddy earth of which he was formed; yea, somuch the greater, inas∣much as then he was a sinner & mortall; and here he is revived, sanctifyed, & immortall. We must needs acknowledge him very ingratefull that will not render perpetuall applauds to that pen, that hath so learnedly, in this Treatise, eternized our Common father. My Lord. I remaine of your most Illustrious Lordship.
