TO quhome suld I my Rurall veirse direct,
Bot vnto him that can thame weill correct,
Befoir quhome suld this mater ga to licht,
Bot to ane Faithfull Godly Christin Knicht,
To quhome can I this lytill throuch propyne,
Bot vnto ane of Excellent Ingyne,
Not for the termes nor for the worthynes,
Of ony thing that I do heir expres:
Bot for becaus I aucht of bound dewtie
To dedicat to him sum Noueltie.
Go bill than to the Laird of Dune I send the,
Beseiking him to tak his pen and mend the,
Mend the (alaik) quhy suld he tals that pane:
To sicht the ones it will bot vex his brane
For as in sum Schyre thair is bot ane myre
Quhilk is ouir all that man and beist dois tyre:
Sa into the he sall bot ane fault find
Quhilk is ouir all befoir and als behind.
Ʒit not the les I knaw him sa discreit,
Gif he mend not thy veirse and haulting feit
Ʒit at the leist sa surely he will byde the
That Poets nane sall se the to diryde the,
Pas on than bauldly and to him deploir
This present stait, fair weill I say no moir.
