COnsidering (most sacred, and most
mighty Princesse) that the duety of euery
Subiect is, not onely to obey, but also to the
vttermost of his power, in his degree and
qualitie, to aduance the Honour of his
Prince and Countrey; I haue according to
my poore talent endeuoured, in discharge
of my duetie, for the place of Seruice which
I holde vnder your Maiestie, by your
most Gracious fauour, to frame these Dis∣courses
concerning Armes, Honor, and the Princely Magnificence
of your Maiesties Court, a subiect proper to Armorists, and men of my
profession, not handled heretofore in our English by them, or any other to my
knowledge: Yet fit to be knowen of all Noble and worthy personages, be∣ing
perswaded that as your Maiestie hath bene a Mirrour to all the world
for excellent gifts of Minde, Person, and Fortune: So your Raigne most
happie both for victorious Armes and flourishing Arts, which shall remaine
glorious to all posteritie, may haply receiue some Honourable note from
hence, which I most heartily desire, as the chiefest scope of my dessein.
And so most humbly beseeching your Maiestie to vouchsafe that your
poorest Seruant may in all duetie, and humble deuotion prostrate himselfe,
and his Labours, at your most Sacred feete, I beseech the Almightie
God to graunt your Maiestie to exceede all other Princes in
length of life, in perfect health, in prosperous
Raigne, and all felicitie.
