My Lord,
THe Topicks usually insisted upon
to engage the Favours of the
Great, are those of Honour and
Goodness, of both which your Lord∣ship
has no common share; and if
upon others they have been so pow∣erfully
influential in Addresses of this
kind, Your Lordship will Pardon
me, if being carried with the same
current I presume to commit this lit∣tle
Treatise to Your Patronage, as to
a safe Azilum, sufficient to skreen it
from all the assaults of Male-volence;
and if it be an Argument of Impru∣dence

to range far abroad for that
Good which is attainable nigh at hand,
my Vicinity to your Lordship will not
only justifie this my Practise, but
should I have neglected the improve∣ment
of it upon this occasion, as I
would hardly be brought to forgive
my self for being guilty of the grossest
Folly, so would it bear a Semblance
of the highest indignity offered to
Your Honour, and of the basest diffi∣dence
of Your Goodness.
The Subject, My Lord, must be
acknowledged to be of an Heroical Na∣ture,
and therefore a fit entertain∣ment
to Heroick Minds, and conse∣quently
cannot but be so to Your
Lordship; however the structure
may have suffered through the debili∣ty
of the Architect, who yet has this
humbly to offer to your Lordship,
and under Your Patronage to the

World, that Truth is the great stan∣dard
I have endeavoured to fix my
Eye continually upon, having stre∣nuously
avoided all false Idea's of the
actions of my Country, and herein
have done both the Enemy that justice
due to them in their various conflicts
with us, and made it appear there
was no need of any such prevaricati∣on,
in that True Glory has been no
stranger to the English Arms through
the series of many hundred years to∣gether,
and though things may not
here be exposed in their Native Lu∣stre
and Excellency, yet I cannot o∣therwise
then perswade my self, but
they retain still their Native and O∣riginal
verity.
But to dwell no longer upon the
Products of my own Teeming Fancy,
I submit all to Your Lordships ade∣quate
Judgment, and if in this my

studied Brevity you meet with any
thing grateful or divertive, so as that it
may conciliate Your Lordship's Good O∣pinion
of me, his highest ambition is gra∣tified
who begs leave to subscribe him∣self
My Lord,
