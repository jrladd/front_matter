THO' it was your Ladyships Favour to me, that did give the first Birth to the Subject contain'd in this Book, by listing me amongst your Ser∣vants; which, as it did at once raise my Honour, so did it the Envy and Malice of my Persecuters: Yet I could have satisfied my self with the humble Content of a lower Patronage, were I not more ambitious of giving some Testimony of that Service, which I owe You, than deriving Honour upon my self from the Glory of Your Protection.
But tho' I be not acted by Ambition; yet, when I consider the Greatness of Your Quality, and the Excellency of Your personal Accomplishments on the one hand, and the entertainment such Addresses receive from the Censo∣rious World on the other, I am apt to think, men will say I design rather honour to my self, than Service to you. But, Madam, let not the happy Necessity I lie under of advantaging my own Credit, while I serve You, prejudice the sincerity of my Intentions, since 'tis the constant Fate of all the Votaries of Greatness to be engag'd in such a Necessity. And I am the more encourag'd in this, that the Matter I relate is not altogether un∣known to Your Ladyship; and that I must make frequent and honourable Mention of You and your most Noble Family; and that I humbly acknow∣ledge, notwithstanding my Innocence, and the Justice of my Cause, had I not been supported by your Goodness and Authority, I might have sunk under the violence of that Fury and Malice, that did prosecute me. Ma∣dam, I wish you could find as many things in the Ensuing Papers, which would deserve your Patronage; as you will, that need it. I hope your Goodness will pardon whatever your Judgment cannot approve in the mat∣ter of my Conduct. I will ever value your single Approbation more, than the Applause of the Theatre. But, if I miss both, I hope you will give me leave to promise to my self pardon for the Presumption of this Address; and to assume to my self the honourable Title of,
Madam,
