AS the Gentiles were wont to worship some publike Genius besides their privat Spirits, & to consecrate the tree Aesculus vnto their Gods in common, as severall trees, severally to eve∣rie one of them: so I, albeit somewhat to their imitati∣on, haue dedicated the particular parts of this Institu∣tion vnto my especiall good friends, yet I dare not of∣fer the whole vnto your GRACE, whom I honour a∣boue them all. For his MAIESTIES INSTRVC∣TIONS being so perfect, and for the most part apper∣taining by right, no lesse vnto your Grace, then vn∣to his HIGHNES; he might be esteemed distra∣cted of his wits, and voide of all vnderstanding (as Virgill write to Augustus about his Aeneids) whosoeuer would presume to present you any other.

VVherfore, for the present in emploring most hū∣bly your Gracious protectiō against the firie tongues of Sycophants, without al prophanes, idolatrie, or blas∣phemie, I vowe and consecrate my selfe with an euer∣burning affection to liue and die,
YOVR GRACE
