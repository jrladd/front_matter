MOrality (worthye
Sir) giueth vs this
instruction, that
Fortitude is more
apparant in sustai∣ning
then in per∣forming:
and Di∣uinity
assureth vs that he that endureth
Gods tryalls with a pacient humility, and
an humble patience, shall thereby ascend
a state most glorious. How much it be∣hooueth
both your selfe and me, to apply
this Cataplasme to our owne present
estates, it is best knowne to vs both, who
haue thus long sayled in a deepe, darke
sea of misfortunes: but as the diuine
light shone vnto Sire du Plessis in his
deepest night of sorrowes, and shewed
him the way to his wished rest, so let vs
light our Torches at his, and out of these
his teares for the death of his onely





sonne, extract a Quintessenc for the
cure of all our owne calamities. To this
end, haue I presented them to you, per∣haps
in a forme vnfiled, yet no such (I
am sure) as will returne from you, vn∣accepted.
The discourse of it selfe is a
generall Amulet, and being truly worne,
resisteth all the infections of fortune.
Take it then, and weare it, God may
lend you sonnes, and take them away
againe at his vnchangeable pleasure;
Keepe this Enchiridiō therefore at your
elbowe, vpon all such occasions: wherein
you shall finde desciphered both the passi∣ons
of a louing parent, and that restraint
of them, that befitteth a religious Chri∣stian.
