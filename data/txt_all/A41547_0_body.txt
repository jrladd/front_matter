Most Honoured SIR,
I Hope I shall not need a further Apology for this Presumption, then to let Your Honour un∣derstand, that I have been known a Servant to Your most Illustrious Family, and have been Dignified with the Quality of Conductor (As Tutor) to Your Noble Cou∣sin, Mr. John Howard, Only
 Son to that Incomparable Person, the Right Honourable, my Lord Viscount Andever, and Heir ap∣parent to the House of Berkshire; Quem terris tantum ostenderunt fata, An inestimable Jewel, that Nature but shewed, and straight put up again. This Gemm being thus Ravished from the World, and me, to whom I originally in∣tended this Service, Elucent rea∣son cast me upon this boldness, to make my Addresse to Your Most Honourable Patronage, who are the Heyre of all the Hopes of all Your Superexcellent House, and the Top of so Numerous and No∣ble a Family, next after Your most Illustrious Father, who hath by His known Gallantry, and Tran∣scendent
 Generosity superadded more Lustre and Glory to his dead Ancestors than ever he received from them, though all so Eminent∣ly Recorded in the Book of Fame; In the next place, I presume Your Noble Goodness will be more in∣clinable to Pardon this great Boldness that I have taken, to Plant Your Honoured Name in the Frontispiece of this Tyrocinium, it being so suitable to Your Tender Years; and I hope it will prove usefull for Your Honour, and all the Nobility of the Nation, to make Your Ingress more easie into the Latine Tongue; which with Your other Perfections, that all the World already not only Prog∣nosticates, but reads in Your pre∣sent
 Epitome, will (I doubt not) place you in a greater Volume, a∣mongst all those Glorious Heroes, before spoken of, under the Canopy of Immortality; and if this small Mite of Mine, may contribute any thing towards it, I shall arrive at my utmost ambition, which is (next after my Deceased Master) to have Served so Princely a Per∣son as Your Self, and to be Honou∣red so far as to be Owned still, by Your Most Excellent Family, in Quality of a Servant; and by Your Great Goodness; As,
Sir,
