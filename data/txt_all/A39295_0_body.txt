Right Worshipful and Worshipful,
THE just Sense I had of the many
Defects of this Sermon, made me
very unwilling to Appear in Pub∣lick,
when so many Correct and Excel∣lent




Discourses have been Printed upon
the same Argument and Occasion. But
when You were pleas'd to make it Your
Request, I thought Obedience would be
better Resented than Excuses; and was
therefore willing, rather to Publish my
Own Infirmities, than to Incur the Im∣putation
of Disrepect or Disobedience to
my Superiours, to whose Commands I owe
an Absolute Deference and Regard.
I wish the Performance had been more
Worthy of Your Names: But such as 'tis,
it is with all Humility Address'd to You,
as the Only Opportunity I have yet had,
of making those Publick Acknowledgments
that are Due for Your singular Favours
to my Self, and for Your Generous Li∣berality
to the Clergy of this Place; few
Corporations (if any in the Kingdom)
Voluntarily Contributing as You do, out
of Your Publick Revenue, above Eight
Hundred Pounds per Annum towards

the Maintenance of the Clergy and Schools.
But what ought to be dearer to us than
this, is, the Charitable Constructions You
put upon our Labours, Your early and
constant Attendance, and solemn Deport∣ment
at Church; Your frequent receiving
Monthly Sacraments, and Your sober and
exemplary Conversation; which as they
bespeak a true Sense of Religion, so also
Your sincere and steady Affection to the
present Establishment of our Church. And
because nothing is so much wanting to
make us the happiest Church in the World,
as Reformation of Manners, Your late
Orders for the better Observing the Lord's
Day, and Your putting the Penal Laws in
brisk and vigorous Execution against Pro∣faneness
and Immorality, give us no small
Hope, that as You have already put a stop
to the present Growth of Debauchery
among us, so also, that hereafter You will
more effectually Suppress it. If this Ser∣mon
be any way Instrumental in promoting

so good a Work, it will answer Your De∣sign
in commanding it to be Printed, and
mine in Preaching it; which, that it
may be subservient to so good an End, is
the hearty Prayer of
