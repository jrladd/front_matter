Sir
VPON your word, this ser∣mon
was made and preached.
And though the importunity
of some drew it to the presse
beyond my intent: yet it is
desirous to returne unto you againe, that
under the wings of your protection, it may
remaine as a faithfull witnesse of my un∣feined
desire, of the reformation of the
whole Deanery of the Isle of Wight To
which if you according to your place, shal
put your helping hand, and deale couragi∣ously,
the Lord shall be with you: and we
shall not cease praying, that you may bee

an ancient and honorable Father in Israel.
From my studie at Arreton, June 1. 1632.
