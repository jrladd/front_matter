THis our whole Iland, ancient∣ly called Brutaine, but more aunciently Albion, presently containing two Kingdomes, England and Scotland, is cause (right Honorable) that to di∣stinguish the former, whose only Occurrents I abridge, from the other, re∣mote from our Historie, I intitle this my Booke ALBIONS ENGLAND. A subiect, in troth, (without vaine-glory be it spokē) worthy your Honorable Patronage: had it passed frō the

Pen of a more countenaunced Author. But for great Personages gratefully to entertaine the good wils of meane workemen, is answerable to themselues, and animating to feeble Artists. I therefore secure of your Honors Clemencie, & herein not vnlike to Phaëton, who at the first did fearefully admire euē the Pallace of Phoebus, but anon feareles aduenture euen the presence of Phoebus, (hauing dedicated a former Booke to him that from your Honor deriueth his Birth) now also present the like to your Lordship, with so much the lesse doubt and so much the more duty, by how much the more I esteeme this my latter laboure of more Valew, & I owe, & your Lordship expecteth especiall dutie at the hands of your Seruant. And thus (right Honorable) hoping better than I may offend, desirous to please, desperate of praise, & destitute of a bet∣ter Present, I make Tender onely of good will, more I haue not, for your Honors good word, lesse I hope not.
