I Haue penned for your master¦ships pleasure one of the sto∣ries which maister Streamer tolde the last Christmas, and which you so faine wold haue heard reported by master Fe∣res him selfe. And although I be vnable to penne or speake it so pleasantly as he could, yet haue I so nerely vsed both the order and wordes of him that spake them, which is not the least vertue of a reporter that I doubt not but that he and maister VVillot shal in the reading thinke they heare master Strea∣mer speake, and he him selfe in the like acti∣on shall doubt whether he speaketh or rea∣deth. I haue deuided his oration into three partes, and put the argument before them, and an instruction after them with such notes as might be gathered therof: so ma∣king it booke like, and intituled. Be ware the Cat. But because I doubt whether master Streamer wilbe contented that other men plowe with his oxen, I meane penne such thinges as he speaketh, which perhaps hee

would rather do him selfe to haue (as he de∣serueth) the glory of both therfore I besech you to learne his mind herein. And if he a∣gree it passe in such sorte, yet that he peruse it before the Printing, and amend it if in any poynt I haue mistaken him. I pray you likewise to aske master Ferres his iudge∣ment herein, and shewe him that the cure of the great plague of master Sreamers translation out of the Arabicke, which hee sent me from Margets, shalbe Imprinted assone as I may conueniently. And it I shall perceaue by your tryall, that master Strea∣mer allowe my endeuours in this kinde, I will hereafter as Plato did by Socrates penne such things out of the rest of our Christmas communications, as shalbe to his great glo∣rie, and no lesse pleasure to all them that de∣sire such kinds of knowledge. In the meane while I besech you accept my good will, and learne to beware the Cat. So shal you not only performe that I seke but also please the Almightie who alwayes pres you:
Amen.
