WHen the golden Tripos, (right Honourable, and no lesse Worshipfull) whereon was written Detur sapients, was found in the Promontories of Grecia, they presented it to Socrates: and such Anti∣quaries as could from the Gymnosophists, draw any speci∣all principle of gouernment, brought all their opinions in∣to the Librarie of Themistocles. The Graecians dooing the one because Socrates was a wise man, the Antiquaries the other, for that Themistocles was a great polytitian. Apollo is worthy of his Laurell, Mercurie of his Caduceus, Iupi∣ter of his Scepter: Caesar must haue his due, Kinges theyr fealtie, and Magistrates their honours, euen with reue∣rence. Hauing (right Honorable and Worshipful) read ouer an Italian Pamphlet, dedicated to the Signorie of Venice, called La Burza Reale, full of many strange & ef∣fectuall Aphorismes, ending in short contriued Quadru∣plicities, translating it ino our vulgare English tongue, & keeping the tytle, which signifieth the Royall Exchange, I presumed, as the Italian made offer of his worke to the Venetian state, so to present the imitation of his labours to

the pyllers of thys honourable Cittie of London, which to counteruaile theyr Burza Reale, haue a Royall Exchange: flourishing with as honorable Merchaunts, as theirs with valorosissim Mercadori. But to leaue off comparisons, be∣cause such insertions are odious, yet this boldly wee may boast out of the Antiquaries, that our Cittie of London, that famous Troynoant, plotted and erected by Brute and after famozed by king Lud, and his successors, is more an∣cient farre then their Cittie of Venice. For theyr Magi∣strates, although theyr cheefe Gouernour be a Duke, yet his estimation is so circumscript within the counterchecks of the Consiliaedori, that his Dukedome is a bondage, his au∣thoritie small, and his commaund little, and Ex Contmp∣tu smper manca st iustitia, in so much that the verie poore Cttizens will in derision, call him Aurco sruidore: where∣as the Lord Mayor of London, entituled with honour and knight-hoode, purchased by his Predicessours valour, vn∣der whom the Sheriffes are next in authoritie, hath by a speciall Charter and priuiledge, graunted him from the Crowne, the Lietenantshyp, and absolute gouernaunce and regment of the Cittie, in such ample manner, as hys commaund stretcheth to the setting vp and aduauncing of vetue, and to the suppressing and abolishing of vice and vanities. Prouided that the honourable Cttizens alwaies carefull for the Common-wealth, elect such a graue, an auncient Magistrate, as for his vertue, religion, wealth & worthinesse, may rightly be called Pater Patria. For our Merchaunts and other Cittizens, though they generalli attaine not to that excesse of riches that the Venetians do, yet for the enlargement of the liberties of their Citie, they stand so much vppon their credits, as they grudge not to disburse any sum, eyther necessarie to their priuate Polu∣tia, or helpfull to the common profit of theyr Countrey. For religion they haue the Gospel, for iustice a seuere law executed with clemencie, beeing Merchaunts wyth theyr

freendes and traffique fellowes, otherwise martiall minded souldiours, to resist the violence eyther of any priuate mu∣tinie, or any common enemie, as valiant to attempt in wars as to counsaile in peace. And although Venice be a Cittie seated in the Ocean, and enuironed round about with the Sea, standing much vpon their Armado and Nauall fight, yet our Cittizens of London, (her Maiesties royall fleete excepted) haue so many shyppes harboured within the Thames, as wyll not onelie match with all the Argoses, Galleyes, Galeons, and Pataches in Venice, but to encoū∣ter by sea with the strongest Cittie in the whole worlde: Considering therefore, (right honourable and worshipful) the excellencie of thys Cittie, the honour of the Magi∣strates, the worshyp of the Merchaunts, and the generall worthines of all in one simpathie. I thought good, as the Italian presented his Bursa Reale to the Venetians, so to presume the patronage of this Royall Exchange vnto your Honour, being worthily aduaunced to the regiment of the Cittie, and to the right worshipfull Sheriffes, for their ver∣tues called to their speciall offices: hoping your Lordship and theyr worships, will vouchsafe to patronise the labours of so meane a Scholler, if not for the worthines of the mat∣ter, yet for the name and tytle of the Pamphlet: frō which Royall Exchange, if any Cittizen or other gather any prin∣ciple of worth, or haue in-sight for the following of vertue or auoyding of vice, their profits shall be noted to proceed from your honourable and worshipfull dispositions, vnder whose patronage this booke is shrowded. And thus re∣sting vpon your gracious and fauourable acceptaunce, I commit your Lordship and theyr worships to the tuition of the Almightie.
