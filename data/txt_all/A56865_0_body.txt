MADAM,
WHAT You here receive, is due onely to Your self, it being the Product of that contemplative re∣tirement to which my dear Father resign'd the two latest years of his life; The Author is highly esteemed in his own Country; and hath met with so good Reception in ours also, that he already seeth a Second Impression, which in this Age, not a little commends a Trea∣tise of this Nature: Vpon this occasion I was sollicited by the Stationer to acquaint the Rea∣der (by whom it hath been so kindly entertain∣ed) with the Name of the Person to whom he

is indebted for the English Edition: And having herein satisfied the Importunity of the One, and the Curiosity of the Other, it rests onely I present it to Your Ladiship, together with the humble Duty of.
Madam,
