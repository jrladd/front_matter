AS my offer is reasonable, so hope I that ye vvill accept the same, and cleare your selfis vith reason, baith for your a∣vvin cause, and for the contentement of sic as ar in doubt, if ye haue the true kirk and lauful calling, or else beleueth assured∣lie that ye haue nather of them. J am in died but à particulaire and single man, quha maketh the offer, yet assure your selfs that there is no Catholik on lyf being of discretion and knavvledge, but vvil say & promise, yea man accōplish the same, as being oblished to acknavvledge the true

kirk vnder no lesse paine then eternal con∣demnation. Quherefore J pray yov to an∣svver vvith à cōmune accord, or, if anie particulair amonges yov ather taketh the burding of him self, or getteth that charge of yov, to approue his labours by your pu∣blique consent. Mairouer because sindry in place of good and solide reasons, giues iniurious vvords, reason vvald ye ab∣steine therefra, examining my argumentes & ansvvering thereto solidelie, & to vvy vveal my proofes and mynd, rather then to pik at vvords. For so I think to do, if anie ansvver be is maid to me, vvilling nather to giue nor receaue fals or light mo∣ney, for good paimēt, meikle lesse the drosse and scumme of iniurious talk for good gold of sufficient proofes. It is question of à maist precious iovvell, lat vvs touch it vvith an innocent & cleane hand, mouth, and hart. He shalbe victorious, quha hes or findeth the trueth, quhilk can not be haid except in the true kirk amonges the

lauful pastors, to quhome vve ought due∣tiful obedience, quhilk moueth me at this tyme to submit all that I haue vvrittin here, or shal vvrit eftervvard in matters of religion, to the iudgement of the Ca∣tholik Apostolik and Romaine kirk and pastours of the same: (as in matters of e∣stait, to his M. his honorable counsel, & o∣ther vvhatsoeuer his magistrats or officers, if I haue spoken in any thing vnreuerētly: for my intention is vpright to both) be∣cause at this present I am assuredlie per∣suaded that shee is only the true kirk guy∣ded by lauful pastors. Quhen ye proue me that this honour appertineth onlie to your companie, and sic others as agreeth vvith yov in vnitie of doctrine, J shal behaue my self vith lyk submission and reuerence tovvards yov in al respectes. J haue tald yov my opinion and ioyned reasons therto, quhereby ye may see me reddie to receaue yours & to knavv therby quhat assurēce ye haue of your kirk & calling, vvithout

the quhilk assurence nather can vve enter in vith yov, nor they quha ar alreddie vith yov, remaine vith saif cōscience: for quha can be in quyetnes of mynd, not be∣ing assured if he be in Gods house, out of the quhilk there is no saluation? J pro∣test before him, to quhom no thing is hidde that my offer procedeth of à sincere mynd tovvardes his honour vvith earnest desyr of your vveal, and all Christians and principallie of my contray men; & nather of cōtempt of yov, nor presumption of my avvin strenth. As to anie of your per∣sonnes, the euil arriue to me, that I vvald vvish to yov. I am affectionat to the re∣ligion that J professe, true it is (quhilk as J beleeue, can not iustlie offend yov, seing that if ye mak me youris, ye may haue me alse forvvard for yovv) yet I haue vsed alse litil offensiue language as I culd. But if any thing hes eschapped out of my penne, that may be interpreted othervvayes then I vvald vvish, J pray yov pardon me;

and think that oftentymes the bitternes commeth rather of the matter it self, then of my natural. If anie be so hard and dif∣ficil that he vvil not accept my excuse, nor pardon that quhilk in his opinion is of∣fence; the best vvay to reuenge him self on me, is to be maire modest then he thin∣keth me to haue beine; for he vvil beare a∣vvay by that moyen the honour of Chri∣stian modestie, quhilk J vvald glaidlie haue. The armes of flyting ar vnpropre in this field, quherein theis of solide rea∣son may onlie obteine the victorie. If ye proue your kirk to be good and your cal∣ling lauful, J vvil esteime vvorse of all other companies diuided frome yov in do∣ctrine, then ye can say, vvrit, or think. God of his infinit mercie by vertue of his trueth ioyne vvs all together here in his kirk militant, that vve may be partakers of eternal blisse in his kirk triumphant, to the quhilk bring vvs the father, sonne & holie spirit.
AMEN.
