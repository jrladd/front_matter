SIR,
THE following Sheets are exact∣ly fitted for you, they treating of what you us'd to divert your self with in Moorefields, Co∣vent-Garden, &c. And as
it has afforded you some Laughter to see the ga∣ping Crowd be gull'd by the enchanting Tongues of Quack and Zany, who would unlock their Ears, and steal a Passage, by a magick Pill, into their Pockets, and so send them away with a small Apothecary's Shop, either to kill them∣selves or their Neighbours: So I hope they will revive your former Mirth in the reading them.
As soon as his infallible Jewels are dispos'd of, he
presents you with his Jack Pudding, who mounts his hempen Fortune, flying like a Bird in the Air; and when he has fool'd it about half an Hour, he promises his mobbish Spectators more Diversion the next Visit, honours them with a gracious Nod, and comes down: And this the Noble Doctor gives them, and his infallible Packet, at so small a Price as Sixpence.
So dear Friend, if by presenting you with their
Speeches, I may adminis∣ter a Pill to purge Melan∣choly, and divert your Leisure Hours, I shall have gain'd my End; and am proud of entertaining one for whom I have so great an Esteem.
