THere needs no more to declare
to all the World who you are,
when I shall tell them, that it is to the
most Religious, and vertuous; the
most discreet, and the most charming
of your Sex: to speak less, were to
injure your Merits, as well as my
Iudgment; to say more (and name
you) were to undervalue the discern∣ment
of all who know what perfection
is, and where all the Graces which
are scattered amongst other Ladies of
Quality are assembled in one.
I made choice of this piece (whilst I
was lately at Paris) to divert my Go∣verness
with; because the Truth and
Dignity of the Historical Part (which
you more affect) may commute for the
Trifles of the Romantick (which you less

regard) and have rendered it
English, not because you are unac∣quainted
with the Original (who are
Mistress of the most polished Langua∣ges)
but to give you some account of
the instructions I acknowledge to have
received from you, how I should em∣ploy
the less serious moments of my
Time, as well as the most studious,
and recollected. I had but to imi∣tate
your example, to pay at once my
duty to God, my self, and all the
world.
This is the express Character of
my Governess, the account her Pupil
thinks fit to give of his attempt, and
of the veneration he bears
