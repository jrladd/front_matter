BEing stirred vp, (most Reuerende father in God) with the sweete exhortation of Paul, who sayth, in spirituall thinges I would not haue you ignoraunt, but couet spirituall giftes, and most chiefely for to prophesie, which doth edefie, exhort and cōfort: I thought it good, seeing the church of God tos∣sed with stormes, through the depe∣nes

of Sathan, who roreth like a de∣uouring Lion, and worketh the spirit of error in mens harts, & so∣weth tares among the wheat of the Lord, to laboure in the vineyard of spirituall vnderstanding, by the goodnes of the vnspotted Lambe, who openeth the booke with the se∣uen seales, wherein the whole state of his Church is reuealed, in what case it shall stand, from his assen∣tion, till his comming in glory. Touching which Reuelations, with all the misteries of the Scripture, I hauing written a booke at large, called the golden closet, and Key that vnlocketh heauenly misteryes,

and another called the glorious gar∣land of mans glorification, thought it good, in the meane time, hauing sent this epistle and others to diuers Papists in England (touching whom a good worke by the grace of God is wrought) to dedicate this same vnder your protection, hopyng that as it hath done good to others by writing, so by Print it may doe much more, if it shall please you of your good fauoure and Heauenly giftes, wherewith you are knowen to bee fruitfull among men, to the glory of God, and consolation of Soules, and to the reward of your Heauenly calling in Iesus Christ:

to accept it. Thus I doe cōmend your Lorship in my daily prayers to the keeping of the Almighty.
