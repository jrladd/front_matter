Gentlemen,
IT can neither with Truth nor Modesty be denied, but must (and will by all truly Astphilar Spirits) be freely and thank∣fully Acknowledged, that those many accurate Observations of the places and motions of the Hea∣venly Bodies, which have been happily and in∣dustriously made in the present and some late prece∣ding Ages (after Mankind was awak'd from that Monk-rock'd Security in which it had been lull'd for several generations, and Learning and Religion in some measure restor'd to their genuine use and design, of being means to attain to a due know∣ledge of God, and even sensible conviction of his Nature and Attributes, and to be profitable helps to direct us in our Affairs and Conversations,) have by the diligence and Industry of sundry Learned Men of great skill and Dexterity in Cosmometrical Rations, Proportions, and Opera∣tions, been so well and ingeniously used and im∣proved
to the end intended by the laborious Obser∣vators, that they have greatly advanced that part of Sydereal Science, above what it had ever before attain'd to, if not almost to its utmost pitch of perfection.
Yet is it also but too bewailably manifest that the Institution of Coelestial Observations, and the thence detection and deduction of Planetary places and motions, and composure of Astronomick Tables, have of late been generally undertaken, by persons little skilled, if not rather wholly Ignorant, of Sydereal significations; and such as knew little else concerning the Heavenly Bodies, beside an uncertain and imperfect notion and ac∣count of their number, order, revolutional periods, the quality of their orbs, and frame of the Mun∣dane system, and the craft of wielding a Qua∣drant or Telescope, and of performing the ordi∣nary Trigonometrical operations; With which imperfect stock of Astral Skill, many have of late undertaken to frame Tables of the Heavenly motions, and do as confidently set up for Astro∣nomers, as if they had the knowledge of Daniel or Abraham. A pretence altogether as Absurd and ridiculous, as if one should take upon him to write a Medical Dispensatory, without any farther knowledge of Herbs and other Simples, than only a lame and defective notice of their number, colour, shape, places of growth, yearly seasons, and other meer sensible accidents and out∣ward Circumstances.

And in regard of the great mysteriousness of uranical portentations and the consequent difficulty of truly understanding them; which requires not only common Reason and Discretion, and a fame∣or-gain-spurr'd diligence and Industry, by which alone the Metrical or Mathematical part of this Science may be laudably practis'd and culti∣vated, and accordingly now-a-days commonly is so; But also a particularly adapted Temper and Capacity (Astronomers as well as Poets, being rather the handy-work of Nature, than either of Art or Education:) A propension to it purely for its own sake, and a spirit unbyassed by lucre and partiality, without which the greatest endeavours will prove utterly vain and fruitless. And finding also that the unhappy thirst of se∣cular gain, and of the frothy reputation of va∣rious knowledge, is now so predominant in the minds of the far greater part of the pretended Votaries of Wisdom, and (amongst the rest) of the Professors and pursuers of this Science; Insti∣gating (or rather seducing) them vain-gloriously to tamper with so many several Studies, and those also utterly unnecessary, and widely irrela∣tive to each other, any one of which (to be duly skillful therein) were alone enough to employ the whole time and faculties of any one Man, That they never become competent, and much less perfect in any; but are generally so weak, im∣perfect, and insufficient, that their practice is commonly successless or pernicious to their Clients,
and no less Ignominious and discrediting to them∣selves. It may still be sadly said and lamented, that Astronomy is but (or hardly) half restor'd, being but (as Adam before his Inspiration) a meer Body without a Soul.
For we live in an Age wherein as well the matter as the methods of Study and Learning are chosen rather for their fashionableness, and for their publick esteem among Gowned or Estated Men, especially who have long practis'd and profess'd them (though a Divine Pen has long ago assur'd us, that great Men are not always Wise, nor the Aged universally Men of under∣standing) than for their own Intrinsick dignity or excellency; And rather for their promising∣ness to the secular Fame, Promotion, or advan∣tage of their Professors, than their tendency or necessity to the Benefit or Utility of such as consult or employ them. And wherein Youth is by the modern unhappy methods of Education, kept so long in the Porch of Wisdom's Temple, in Lear∣ning a parcel of silly mis-called Arts and Old Foreign Tongues, little or nothing necessary for any but wrangling Clerkers (who are but a small and the most needless part of the Professors of Science) and in Conning and Contemplating those Paganish Fictions, Dotages, and Macrologi∣cal Impertinencies, contained in the Books com∣monly used for that purpose; That they never are permitted to enter her inner Courts, or have but a very small time to abide there, and much too
short to gain a true knowledge of her solid my∣steries. Beside that their native faculties are so distorted and depraved by such frivolous and Sophistical (pretended necessary) preparations, and their Heads and Fansies so stuff'd and cloy'd with Idle and Abstracted (and mostly or gene∣rally Erroneous) Notions, who leave no time nor room for sound and practical knowledge: That if the Laws of the Land, or the weakness of their Patrons or Clients did not contribute to ensure them an ample or competent livelihood, the soli∣dity of their knowledge, and success of their practice, would never be able to procure it, ei∣ther by Physick, Astronomy, or Divinity, the three great branches of Mystical Science: Each of which may abundantly be proved to be ex∣treamly corrupted and erroneous, even where they are vulgarly reputed and most confidently pretended to be most pure and Orthodox.
Neither indeed can it possibly be otherwise, when such an invincible variety not only of speculative, but even of the profoundest and most difficult practical Arts and Studies, are undertaken by one individual Person, for whom any one of them alone were sufficient, though as highly fitted and qualified for it, as God and Nature do enable any to be; nothing being now and for some Ages pass'd more common, not only in Colleges and Universities, but in other places abroad in the World also, than for one and the self same Person openly to Study, Profess,
and practice Arts and Sciences so vast in them∣selves, and mostly or wholly so irrelative to one another, as are Medicine, Logick, Rhetorick, Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and all the several parts of Mathematicks and Geo∣metry; Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack, and sundry other both Ancient and Modern Languages, sometimes a dozen or fif∣teen together; Musick, Drawing, Painting, Physick, Astrology, and some others; or at least such a considerable plurality of these, as that any modest and honest minded Man, who will not belye his Capacity to advance his Re∣putation (as it is too plain very many do) may easily perceive and will freely confess them not masterable to any competent perfection (save only to make an empty noise and shew before such as little understand them) by any one Man whatsoever. And some of which are not only im∣pertinent too, but even inconsistent with a due prosecution and intellection of the other; for what use of Logick, Rhetorick, or Geometry is there in the practice of Physick, which also is of it self alone a Science large enough for any one Man to master, and the like might be said of sundry others. And albeit that Astrological Information may be of good use to a Physician, (as well as Medical Instructions to an Astro∣nomer, and to many other kinds of Persons and Professors beside) yet does it not therefore follow that he must of necessity Study both Sciences
himself, (for then every Man should be master of all Arts and Trades, because he has oftentimes use for them.) But he rather should in his practice of the one, derive and receive all necessary helps by the other, from such as make it their whole Study and Profession; and the same may be said of Tongues, and all other Arts and Stu∣dies: for while Men apply their Minds to so many several Sciences, each of which is so vast and profound, and so little pertinent or related to the rest, they only become meer pratling smat∣terers in all, but are really Dexterous and suffici∣ent in none.
Hence it comes that this transcendant Scien∣ce, the most precious gem amongst the Trea∣sures of Wisdom, the clearest Glass to behold Almighty Power, and the only Image of Divine Omnisciency; which the unbounded goodness of its supream Eternal Author, has ordained for the use and instruction of Man, to direct his steps in this vale of tryal and Tribulation, where∣in he is wholly left to his own fate and discre∣tion, and to his native will and disposition in the choice of good or evil, to shift for himself the best he can, though not without gracious pre∣mises of providential reliefs and affistances upon his humble and earnest prayers to obtain them, in all such times and cases of extream affliction and adversity, wherein his own Wit and indu∣stry fail him; and to enlighten his understan∣ding clearly to see into the dark corners of di∣stance
and futurity; that he may not run blind∣fold into places and enterprises, nor be taken unawares like a Bird in a snare, when an evil time comes suddenly upon him: Is become so utterly depraved and corrupted, that what now commonly passes by its name, is very little else but a heap of folly and falsehood; and so far from any appearance, and from shewing any effects of a divine and beneficial ordinance, that ma∣ny are Opinion'd there is no such Science in nature; whatever others do affirm of its truth and excellency, is nothing but Fancy and Delusi∣on; whereby this sacred Lamp of Divine and infinite Wisdom, which affords all satisfaction that the mind of Man can desire, concerning any thing past, present, or future, is dwindl'd into smoke and snuff, and fallen to the lowest degrees of contempt with many even of good knowledge and capacity, the sacred and venera∣ble name and Title of Astronomy, being now-a-days wholly attributed to and arrogantly assu∣med and usurped by the bare Metrical or Mathe∣matical part of it, which is no more but its very husk or shell. It being sadly and shamefully obser∣vable, that the Professors of this as well as of other mysterious and profound Sciences, do, through a base thirst after advantage and applause, and a sordid itch to gain the repute and benefits of a great and fashionable variety of skill and knowledge, not apply their Minds so wholly and solely to this sublime and immense Science, (the
known fame and benefits of which alone if duly known and understood, were enough to satisfie any one modest Man) as is requisite to a full or com∣petent perfection therein. To which they afford but some small part of only their spare hours, though vast and profound enough to employ their whole time and faculties, so that their skill and practice cannot but be as they are, and as I am even unwilling to think, and very much more to mention.—
The displeasing observation of those dis-inge∣nious proceedings, and the sway of a strong in∣clination and affection (by many affirm'd to be the certain symptom of an equal Adaption) to this tallest and beautifullest bravch of natural know∣ledge; occasion'd by the sight of some rutilous specks of Truth discovered and found to be yet unextinguished, in stirring up the modern rubbish of its ruins, have prevaild with me to relinquish other employments more promising to my secular advantage, and for some considerable time to se∣quester my self almost wholly from the World, so as to be but little publickly concern'd there∣in, that so I might gain the greater leisures and opportunities to dive into the depths of this Science; for the certain discovery of whose sub∣lime and excellent mysteries, rejecting the ficti∣tious Volumes and veluminous fictions of meer guessing pretenders, as well ancient as modern; and laying aside all other practical Arts and Studies no way pertinent nor serviceable to this;
I have closely applied my thoughts for several years together, to an experimentary examination of the Heavens immediately themselves, by a careful and impartial collation and discussion of sundry significant coelestial faces and positures concerning one and the same particular, the only true method of making and gaining experience: And this not only for the ad-invention of the practical rules of this Science, but also for the tryal of its principles and rudiments, to find which of those now variously delivered by sundry Au∣thors for such, or whether none of those, and what others beside, are the only true and genuine. And herein as my ends have been honest, my affections impartial, my endeavours great, and my desires vehement, so by the favour and aid of the sovereign Author of Wisdom, my Travels have been not unproportionably successful, but ef∣fectual to the discovery of many great Truths ne∣ver hitherto known in the Christian World; and to the perfection and clarification of many others, whereof though some in former days have had some fleeting glimpses, yet was it with so much dimness and uncertainty, as render'd them wholly useless and unprofitable.
And though I shall not yet lay claim to such a degree of perfection therein, as to make all the predictions, and answer all the enquiries proper thereto and possible thereby (for what one Man can be sufficient for these things, who found the Science so defective and corrupt as I did)
yet I shall I undertake to disclose and unfold so many great Truths and excellent Mysteries there∣in, hitherto utterly concealed and unknown, and many others heretofore but darkly and dubiously understood, as shall be abundantly pleasing and acceptable to all who impartially examine and make use of them, and which shall be at least as conducive to advance both the Truth and Credit of the prognostical part of Astronomy, as even the very best of the many late observers and discussers of coelestial motions have contributed to the present improvements of the Mathema∣tical; and shall abundantly prove to all who are endued with Reason, Judgment, and Modesty, that the great pains and expences employ'd by many, in making such observations, and cor∣recting and perfecting the Doctrine of the said motions, are useful and serviceable not only to the mean and shallow arts and purposes of Geography, Navigation, and the civil di∣stinction of Years, Months, and Days, (all which low and inconsiderable ends, which wholly or mostly tend rather to the gratification of Luxury and a needless-curiosity, than to promote any of the genuine ends of true knowledge, may be sufficiently serv'd without any such great ex∣actness;) but to other ends as great and ex∣cellent as the Heavens are high, their face illu∣strious, their greatness stupendious, their courses and motions constant and harmonious, and Mens endeavours to discover them expensive and labo∣rious;
and that the excellent Mysteries contai∣ned in and discoverable by this unparallell'd Science, even though we should wholly lay aside all prognostical use thereof (which yet may be very great and beneficial) but using it only as an in∣genious speculation (as is all or most of that kind of Philosophy now in chief repute,) dis∣playing that exact and wonderful harmony which Almighty God has ordained between the motions and positions of the Heavenly Bodies, and the actions and events of all sublunary creatures, is a thousand times more valuable and worthy to be prized and affected by all who delight to consider the handy works of God, than that fanciful Foolosophy now so much in vogue, of making blind guesses at the secret undisco∣verable reasons and causes of both the ordinary and extraordinary effects and appearances in na∣ture (such as Comets, Magnetism, Winds, &c.) and at the meaning and design of old defaced In∣scriptions, and new found Relicks of Antiquity, and many other such trivial and useless matters, which many now-a-days make a great noise and stir with; or I may rather say it doth as much exceed them, as the Heavens surmount the Earth, and the Wisdom of God transcendeth that of Men.
Neither do I doubt but strongly and reasona∣bly hope, and with God's Assistance fully pur∣pose, by the use and help of due means and endea∣vours, to raise it to that degree of claritude
and perfection, that all who apply themselves hereafter thereunto, with honest and sincere af∣fections and intentions, and a desire to be thereby serviceable to their generation; and who by cer∣tain and never failing rules which shall fully and faithfully be given for that purpose, do find themselves duly qualified and capacitated for this Study, shall by their own experience and endea∣vours be speedily able to supply what is wan∣ting from mine; and by their honest and inge∣nious practice and exercise thereof, and daily demonstration of its excellent use, and of the great good that may be done thereby, declare it as fit and necessary for the Courts and Dominions of Christian Prinoes, as it was and still is re∣puted to be (though but very dimly and imper∣fectly understood) in these of Heathens and Mahometans. This said Mantical or Progno∣stical part of Astronomy (commonly though less properly termed by another name,) being a Science wholly consisting of real wonders, as great as ever the power of God did expose to the sight of Mankind; who may thereby daily behold the Tragedies and Comedies of secular affairs pre-act∣ed by the Planets on the Stage of Heaven, in a far more exact and elegant manner than they are usually re-acted in Earthly Theatres; and thence may attain to a competent Assimilation of his Maker's Omniscience, in the Knowledge of what∣soever his Mind or Spirit can desire concerning any thing past, present, or to come: And this
by Means far more sure and infallible, than the ordinary ones of History, Report and Conjecture.
As a Testimony of my Successes and Improve∣ments in this Science, and an Earnest of what I promise and purpose further to perform therein, I here offer to Your Sagacious Worthinesses (whose several distinguishing Titles and Dignities I shall not now insist on) the following Observations and Experiments; not by craving Your Patronage, and by the Prefixure of Your Name, to concile unto them any greater Favour or Esteem abroad in the World, than what their proper Merit shall be able selfly to procure them; a Shift, which, though now very usual with many others, yet am I as far from desiring as I hope these are from needing it: But rather to recommend to your Favour and Esteem this ancient and venerable Science, which as I am sorry to have been hitherto neglected by You, so I am in hope, that by means of the ensuing Illustrations, it will henceforth appear at least as worthy as any thing else whatsoever, to be en∣rolled amongst the Subjects of Your generous Dis∣quisitions. And therefore, hoping and desiring Your zealous Co-operation herein, so far as the Mattter shall be found meritorions thereof, (which for the future I do not doubt but it will,) I shall here with all due Respectfulness conclude, and al∣ways humbly remain an unfeigned Well-wisher to the prosperous Success of all Your ingenious Tra∣vails and Endeavours.
