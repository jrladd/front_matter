RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL,
This Sermon beares so strange a title in the for∣head, that I durst not (a while) study for a Patro∣nage to it, but intended to send it to the broad world, to shift for it selfe, as fearing it would not be own'd: for it taxeth many vices; specially the Blacke Euell, secret Theeuery, and the White Deuill, slie Hypocrisie; whence it taketh the denomination, now what ambitious Courtier, would grace such a Stranger? what vicious Great∣nesse would entertaine such a Page? what corrup∣ted Lawyer, such a Client? what couetous Gentle∣man, such a Tenant? what vsurious Citizen, such a

Chapman? Indeed what guilty man, such a Booke, as will tell him to his face, thou art the man? yet be∣cause, first generally, the world would thinke, I had brought forth a strange Child; that I could get no Godfather to it; And especially, because you (rare in these Apostate times) are knowen free from the aspersion of these speckled staines, the world bestowing on you, that worthy (not vnde∣serued) Character of Vertue: so that with a cleere & vn-clouded brow (the argument of an innocent soule) you may read these lines; I haue beene bold, at once, to offer this to your Patronage, and my selfe to your seruice. To this, your affection to diuine Knowledge, good profection in it, and much time spent towards the perfection of it, (a disposi∣tion worthy your blood) haue prompted me with incouragement. It is not the first of this nature, that I haue published, (perhaps the last) but if I had not iudged it the best, I would not haue beene so ambitious, as to present it to the view of so ap∣proued a Iudgement. Thus in affiance, of your good acceptance; I humbly leaue you to him, that neuer leaueth his.
