MADAME,
WHen I had seri∣ously bethought my selfe in what doctrine especi∣ally to imply my Ministe∣ry,

in the place in which the Lord had by so strong and strange a prouidence settled me: Amongst o∣ther things I was vehe∣mently inclined to study the Cure of the Feare of Death; both because it may be vsually obserued, that the most men are in bondage by reason of these feares; as also be∣cause I am assured, that ourliues wil become more sweet; yea, and more ho∣ly too, when the feare of death is remoued: And the rather was I incited hereunto, because I haue obserued some defect a∣bout

this point, in the most that haue written a∣bout Death. I am not ig∣norant of the censure, which many may giue of this proiect, as accounting it an impossible thing to be effected; but my trust is, that godly and discreet Christians will restraine censure, when they haue throughly viewed my rea∣sons.
My vnsaigned desire to do seruice vnto GODS Church in releeuing such Christians herein, as are not furnished with better helps, hath emboldned me to offer this Treatise

also to the publike view: I haue presumed in your Honours absence to thrust forth this Treatise vnder the protection of your Honours name: and with∣all I desire heartily to testi∣fie my thankefulnesse for the many fauours shewed vnto me and mine, while your Honour was pleased to be my Hearer. I should also much reioyce, if my testimony (concerning the singular graces God hath bestowed vpon you, and the many good works in which you haue aboun∣ded in the places of your aboad) might adde any

thing, either vnto your Honours praises in the Churches of Christ, or vnto the establishment of the comfort of your owne heart in God, and his Son Iesus Christ.
I haue not made choise of your Honour in this Dedication for any speci∣all fitnesse in this Treatise; for your Honours condi∣tion, in respect of your age, or absence in a place so farre remote. For my earnest trust is, that God will adde yet many yeares to your happy life on earth; and besides I haue had heeretofore occasion

to know how little you were afraid to die, when the Lord did seeme to summon you by sicknes.
That God, which hath ennobled your heart with heauenly gifts, & so made you an instrument of so much good, and content∣ment, vnto that most ex∣cellent Princesse, with whom you now liue, and towards whom you haue shewed so much faithfull obseruance, and dearenes of affection, and careful∣nesse of attendance: Euen the Father of mercy, and God of all consolations, increase in you all spiritu∣all

blessings, and multi∣ply the ioy of your heart, and make you still to grow in acceptation, and all well-doing: Humbly cra∣uing pardon for my bold∣nesse heerein: I commit your Honour to God, and to the word of his Grace, which will build you vp to eternall life: resting

Isleworth, Iuly 14. 1618.
