THIS Treatise which I take the Liberty to Dedicate to your Honours, with all imaginable Respect, was pu∣blished sometime ago in French, and by several Persons of Great Judgment, thought not Unworthy to be presented to your view in English, because of the Importance of the Matter, and the Profit which they thought might from thence redound to Church and State.
The design of it is, to prove by Political Arguments, (a Method New and Extraordinary) that the Romish Religion is the Falsest of any that hath hitherto appeared in the World, because it is the de∣struction and plague of all Coun∣tries where it is Established, and Ruins Nations more▪ than any other False Religion that we have yet heard of.
This I demonstrate by the In∣stance of France, and make it evi∣dent, that Popery occasions the loss of above 200 Millions of Livres per Annum to that Kingdom; whence it follows, that even as to Tempo∣rals, the Kingdom of England reaps unspeakable Advantages by the Re∣formation, which hath delivered her from that Cruel and Unsupportable Yoke.
I have so much the greater Reason to hope that this Book will not be un∣acceptable to your Honours, because it tends more and more to confirm the Protestant Religion in this Kingdom, for the defence of which, against the Tyranny of Popery, you have on all occasions testified an ardent Zeal.
The tender Care and great Charity which you have manifested towards the poor Refugees, who suffer for the said Religion; but above all, the Courage and Zeal you have discover'd in this last War, by sparing nothing that was necessary for the preserva∣tion of the Protestant Interest, have made it gloriously appear to all the Nations of the Earth, that you value neither your Treasures nor your Blood, when there's a necessity of spending them in defence of your Religion; And in effect, there was no less at

Stake, than the loosing or preserving it, for your selves and your Posterity; nay, I may say for the whole Prote∣stant World, and together with that you must have lost your precious Li∣berties, and all that is dear to you as Men and Christians; That it would please God that by your Gene∣nerous Example and Sage Resolves, you may transmit to all succeeding Parliaments, that same Prudence, Magnanimity and Zeal, for the Main∣teance of the Protestant Religion and your Publick Liberties, against all Attempts of Popery, is and shall be the constant Prayer of him, who is with all possible Submission and pro∣found Respect,
