WOrshipfull Sir: hauing drawne together these Compositions, and there-with acquainted some of my wel-willers, studious and skil∣ful in the most delectable Science, it pleased them not onely with sweet words friendly to approoue what I had done, and t'incourage mee boldlie to goe-on in my course of studies, but also with manie arguments earnestlie to im∣portune mee to publish for a com∣mon benefit, which my selfe had done for my owne recreation and priuate exercise. Thus whet-on I did consent, and doe present vnto your worship these Musicall inuentions of mine, not as did the Philoso∣pher his booke of Iustice vnto Antigonus, that delighted in oppression (an vnmeete Patron for so sweet and necessarie a subiect); but as to one addicted to the Muses▪ studious of all good Sciences, excelling in ver∣tue; delighting in Musick; with-all, desiring your Protection and Par∣don: Protection of these my labours, the first fruits of my weake studies against deprauers; Pardon for publishing them so boldlie vnder your worships name: which if I finde (whereof I doubt not) then shall I bee encouraged with more alacritie, both to proceed as I haue now begun, and to prepare my selfe to some greater task. And so I humblie take my leaue, wishing all manner good, both vnto your worship, and all yours.
