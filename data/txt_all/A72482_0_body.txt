Worthy SIR:
THE frequent custome of this Age to challenge Patrons, and to trouble their braines with bestowing vpon those Patrons Mountebancke Encomiums, hath no whit at all taken vp my minde, since no folly can be greedy thereof but shall pur∣chase wit enough for that purpose.
Suffice it is my true knowledge of you, and my truer loue vnto you, which makes mee send this poore infant of my braine, and slender Collections to kisse your hand:
 which in as much as the roote or centre is Vertue, the circumference that happy list or bound, out of which no good man will wil∣lingly stray, and in which I know the good∣nesse of your inclination makes you delight to liue: on whom can I better bestow it, both in respect of the thing, which onely looketh vpon Vertue; and in respect of your selfe, who is not onely a louer, but a suppor∣ter of the vertuous. So that to conclude, if your acceptance shall say I haue done well, I will beleeue all which are good (like you) will agree with you; who doth the contrary I will laugh at, for hee loues not Good∣nesse.
