Worthy Sir,
DIvers times (in my hearing) to the ad∣miration of the whol
Company, you have most judi∣ciously discoursed of Poësie: which
is the cause J presume to chuse you for my Patron and Protector; who are
the happiest interpretor and judg of our English Stage-Playes
this Nation ever produced; which the Poets and Actors of these times, cannot
(with∣out ingratitude) deny; for J have heard the chief, and most ingenious
of them, acknowledg their Fames & Profits essen∣tially sprung from
your instru∣ctions, judgment and fancy. J am vers'd in Forraign tongues and
subscribe to your opinion, that no Nation ever could glory in such
Playes, as the most learned and incom∣perable Johnson, the copious
Shakespear, or the ingenuous Fletcher compos'd;
but J be∣leeve the French for amorous language, admirable inventi∣on, high
atchievements, hono∣rable Loves inimitable con∣stancy, are not to be
equalled: and that no Nation yeilds better Arguments for Ro∣mance Playes (the
onely Poëms now desired) then the French: Therefore, and for you have I
translated the Ad∣ventures and Loves of Cle∣rio and Lozia;
and I doubt not though they fail to receive incouragement from you,
your son, Mr George Beeston (whom knowing men conclude, a hopeful
inheritor of his Fa∣thers rare ingenuity) may re∣ceive them with a gracious
al∣lowance.
And sir, though the work be not entirely happy in your
construction (for my years are not arrived to knowledg to add where the
Author wants matter, or to lessen where he a∣bounds) yet you will find much
newness in the Story, worthy an excellent Poët to insoul it for 
the Stage; where it wil receive ful perfection equal to the
am∣bition of
