My Lord,
IN obedience to the Order I received from your Lordship and the Court of Aldermen, I Present you with this plain Sermon; the whole Design of which is, not to debate any thing, nor to determine on which side the Truth lies, in those warm Disputes which have been among us; but to convince all those, who Love and Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem, how many Controversies there are, which should be laid aside without Disputing, and how a little condescention to each other, may ei∣ther happily Unite us into one Communion, or at least Teach us to Live together in Love and Charity, notwithstanding some different Apprehensions of Things; and I

hope so Charitable a Design as this, will raise no new Disputes and Quarrels a∣mong us.
That GOD would preserve his Church, restore Peace and Unity among Christians, bless this Great and Populous City, and direct your Lordship in the Government of it, in these difficult Times, is the hear∣ty Prayer of,
MY LORD, Your Lordship's Most Obedient Servant,
