AS soon as by the good Providence of God I obtained the favour, and had the Happiness to be Chosen your Clerk, I resolved with my utmost Dili∣gence, to pursue and perform my Duty in this place, and thereby grate∣fully answer the expectation of my Friends, who promoted by Election; and also lay hold of so fair an opportunity to ingratiate my self into the Favour and Esteem of Good Men: Being Convinced, that if I should neglect my Duty, it would render my Follies and Ingratitude more conspicuous to the World. There∣fore that I might in doing the one avoid the other, I endeavoured in the first place to inform my self of the true State and Condition of the Company; upon Inquest whereof, I found it plain and manifest, That for want of Knowledge of the Truth therof, not only many Worthy Benefactors with-held their Assistance towards dis∣charge of their Debts and Charities, But also many Reproaches and Reflections were cast upon this Society; Both from Strangers (with whom they have been no way concerned) And also their Creditors who rendred them obnoxions in Courts of Law and Equity, And before the Commissioners for Charitable Ʋses; As if they had been a Company that possessed a great Revenue, sufficient to pay all their Debts, Yet were so averse from doing that, that they wasted and Consumed their Estate in Feasting themselves, refusing to pay, unless they were Compell'd by Chargeable Suits; which not only aggravated their Creditors, but alienated the Affections of many good Persons, As well Members as others; and caused many Chargeable Suits and Vexatious Prosecutions against them, Notwithstanding the Care and Endeavours of some Worthy and Good Members, who used all possible means to avoid the same. For I cannot deny, but that so long as I was ignorant of the Truth of their Case (though I was an unworthy Member) Yet I was perswaded to believe many things reported of the Grocers, which I now find to be far otherwise. Therefore I made it my great design to acquaint my self with all their Affairs, and past transacti∣ons, that I might be able to make a true representation of the Companies Condition as to all Substantial matters, Both what it was before they Contracted their Debts,
and how they became indebted, what they have already done towards it, and what means and methods they may best use, and prosecute to discharge themselves, to the end those great Reproaches and Prejudices (which through mis-apprehensions and false Reports have been cast on this Company) may be removed. And every true hearted Member that bears a Christian respect to the Pious Memory of our Ance∣stors (who were Worthy Benefactors) and would in discharge of his Duty Com∣mend himself, after their Example, to Posterity, may willingly and chearfully lay to his helping hand. And as a further Testimony of my hearty desires to serve the Members, having so briefly stated the Companies Case, I shall endeavour to give you a short Account of the Antiquity and first Creation and Continuance of the Grocers, as far and clear as I can make Conjecture or have received any probable Account. As to that part of my Duty which relates to the Regulating and Di∣gesting the Companies Books into an orderly Method, as also their Evidences to clear their Titles to their several Rents, Lands and Houses, and the several Schools under their Government; And also the several Ecclesiastical Livings in the dispo∣sition of this Society, with the names of their Founders, and how they became Vested in their Right; And also other Priviledges peculiar to this Society, I have already made such Progress and doubt not speedily to Compleat it, so as it may ap∣pear obvious and plain to be understood by every individual Member, Of which it will not be proper here to give an Account, But I refer to the Books and Records themselves, more fit to be inspected at this Hall by such as have right to know them, than to be exposed to view of others whom it no way Concerns.
