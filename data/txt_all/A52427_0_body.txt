SIR,
'TIS a Maxim of Prudence given by
some of the Nicer Describers of the
Bounds of Gratitude, That it ought to be tem∣per'd
between a total Neglect and a full and
just Requital. To strike off all Scores is, they
say, as uncivil as to discharge none, and eve∣ry
whit as disingenuous not to suffer, as not
to acknowledge an Obligation.
Now, Sir, 'tis one of the proper Happi∣nesses
of my little Fortune to be necessarily
cast upon this Measure. I am got too far in
your Accounts to be able to requite to the full;
some part of them I must ever leave uncros∣sed
as a standing Hold upon me; and tho my
Gratitude it self be never so strong and preg∣nant,
yet the most forward Instance of it can
rise no higher than an Acknowledgment.
And as this is the utmost I can do, so of
doing this too I have so few Capacities and
Opportunities, that I am the less willing to
let go any that offer themselves; which in∣deed
has given a speedier Issue to my Deli∣beration,

whether I ought to Address these
Discourses to your Patronage or no, which
perhaps without the Formality of a Dedica∣tion,
would of right belong to you, as falling
within your District, and as being the Fruits
of that Retirement which by your Free Boun∣ty
I enjoy.
As an Acknowledgment therefore of this
and your other constant Favours, I presume
to put these Discourses into your Hands,
which I hope will be able to do both You and
Me that Justice, as to convince the World,
that as you proceeded by generous and un∣corrupt
Measures in disposing of this Publick
Trust, so you was not altogether mistaken in
your Choice, when you thought fit to Ob∣lige
