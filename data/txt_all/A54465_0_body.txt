Madam,
YOƲR favourable Acceptance of that small Free∣will Offering that I paid to the Memory of the Best of Women, our late most Gracious Queen, in∣courages me to hope that your wonted Goodness, which I have long experienc'd, will vouchsafe to receive this mean Eucha∣ristical Oblation for the Deliverance of our Dread Sove∣reign, (the Best of Princes) from the Barbarous and In∣humane Conspiracy, that was laid against His Sacred Per∣son and Government, with the same Candor which you did the Former: Especially since in Obedience to your Honour's Commands, which I shall ever to the utmost of my Power with all readiness observe, it is made thus Publick. And I am the rather induced to suffer it to pass through more hands than it was at first designed for, because the Chief Subject it treats of, (being the Peculiar and extraordinary Providence, which watches over Good and Righteous Kings, for the Security and Protection of themselves and Govern∣ment, against the most Secret Contrivances that can be form'd against them) may, I hope, convince every one of the Folly and Vanity, as well as Sinfulness and Danger, of all such attempts that are made against either: And that this Particular instance of the Wonderful Discovery of the late Bloudy and Treacherous Design, that was so deeply laid
against the Life of our Gracious Prince, joyned to that series of Signal Providences which hath all along attended his Royal Person for his Preservation from all those Perils to which he hath been so frequently exposed, may at length cause that Obstinate Party, which hath hitherto so unrea∣sonably stood out, to comply with, and to own that Autho∣rity which GOD hath so visibly and so signally appeared for; and by which their own Liberties and Religion, have continued safe to them, and us.
That our Church, (the Best and Purest of all other) and our State, may long Flourish under the Happy and Prospe∣rous Reign of our Wise, Valiant, Merciful, and Religious Leader whom God's own Right-hand hath placed over us, and made so strong for himself; And that your Honoura∣ble Family, which hath so Zealously espoused the Interests of both, may always enjoy the Blessings that accrue to this Nation thereby, and the Everlasting Happiness of the King∣dom that is above afterwards, is, the earnest Prayer of
Madam,
