ALthough there be in Si∣on numbers of such as haue & do cast off their riches into the Lordes easurie: such as are euerie waie reful & able to disburse their two ence committed to thē for the cu∣ng of the wounded man in Ierico: hose labours or rather almes are orious on earth & written in hea∣en: though I knowe my selfe to be one of them, not worth any riches, at onelie a mite, rather wishing to ue, then hauing to bestow the two nce of God, yet haue I bin (as be∣re, so now again) by entreaty won bestow this short sermon, though

it bee but a mite: though nothing to that, which others cast into the trea¦sury. Whereof therefore as of all desire fauorable acceptation, so o your worshippe I am to craue it, to whō I haue bin bold, & yet of dut bound to offer the same, as a true though a smal tokē of my dutiful & thankfull remēbrance of your sun¦drie benefits towards me from tim to time, which the lord god requit where I cannot: who double & mu¦tiplie his blessings vpō you & kee you in al your waies, and vs from those enemies that studie nothin but how to disquiet vs. AMEN
