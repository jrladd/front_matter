AS it hath, Right Ho∣norable, of late plea∣sed your most noble brother in kindenes to accept of this hi∣story, and to grace it with a fauourable countenaunce. So am I nowe embouldened to dedicate this se∣cond part vnto your honour, vvhich here I humbly offer to your Lordships handes, not because I thinke it a gift worthy the receauer: but rather that it should be, as it were a witnes of the loue and duety vvhich I beare to your

Right Noble House.
And when it shall please you to bestowe the reading of these my rude Discourses, my humble request is, that you would thinke I I wish your Honor as many happy dayes, as there be letters contayned in this Historie.
Thus praying for your Honors chiefe hap∣pynes, I end.
