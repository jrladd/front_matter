My LORD,
ALL true English men have
their Eyes upon Your Lord∣ship,
as their Faithful Patriot
and Protector, as a Firm Lover of
their Religion and Country; and they
all pay a profound Respect to that
Illustrious Name, in which the Wel∣fare
of the Nation is so much in∣volv'd.
We are every one of us
sensible of those large and manifest
demonstrations which You have gi∣ven
us of Your Concern for the Pub∣lick

Good in the late Happy Revo∣lution.
Your Heroick Enterprizes,
Your constant Fatigues, Difficulties
and Perils undergone for the Service of
Your Country, are the continual mat∣ter
of our Admiration. We celebrate
and applaud Your never to be for∣gotten
Engaging the French Navy;
when their Admiral felt the destru∣ctive
force of your Martial Thun∣der,
which You poured out so fast
upon him, and which produced a
a Glorious Victory over the Insulting
but Flying Foe: the remembrance
of which Great and Noble Atchieve∣ment:
Your Lordship bears in Your
Honourable Title. Which way so ever
we look, whether at Sea or Land,
we find Your Lordship meriting in a
most sigal manner both of Church
and State. And Your near relation
to his Grace the Duke of Bedford;
whose Family hath been the Nursery
of Patriots and Worthies, yea, and
of Sufferers for the Publick Interest
and Welfare, renders You a Person

yet more Conspicuous in the world.
And lastly, That High Degree of
Honour which Your Prince hath ad∣vanced
You to, and that Eminent and
Honourable Post Your Lordship is
now in, make You capable of being
(what is so much desired by You)
Beneficial not only to the County
You have a more particular Concern
in, but to the whole Kingdom.
But I know Your Transcendent
Modesty will scarcely suffer these
things to be said, and therefore I
dare add no more. The design of
this present Address to Your Lord∣ship,
is, to express my Thankful and
Dutiful Resentments of the undeser∣ved
Favours cast upon me by Your
Lordship, and to offer my sincere
Wishes and Prayers to Heaven for
Your Health and Long Life, that You
may live in the favour of the Most
High, and be bless'd with His Divine
Assistance, that Success may crown

all Your Worthy Undertakings; that
You may continue to be Happy in
the Embraces of so Excellent and
Accomplish'd a Lady as Heaven hath
bless'd You with; that You may be
as instrumental in Preserving the
Church and State as You were in
Restoring them, that You may long
enjoy the Honour which Your Me∣rits
have advanc'd You to, and the
Happiness You have of possessing His
Majesty's Favour; and (in  word)
that You may still be admired, ho∣nour'd
and loved by all his Subjects
that are Wise and Religious.
And now, My Lord, permit me
to beg an Extraordinary favour of
You, but such as I know Your Ge∣nerosity
will not disdain to grant, viz.
that I may have the honour to dedi∣cate
the following Papers to Your
Lordship's Name: which as it will
give a Glory to them, so it will re∣main
a Testimony (which is the thing

I design) of that Entire Service and
Duty which I owe, and shall ever
be owing to Your Lordship. I have
had Your Lordship in my eye ever
since I have begun to be a Writer,
but I could not prevail with my self
to make my Approaches of a sudden
to so Great a Personage; nor was I
furnish'd with a Subject which was
suitable to Your Lordship's Genius.
I forbore to trouble You with Criti∣cisms
and Controversies, though of an
important nature: but now when the
Matters I treat of are agreeable to so
Noble and Exalted a Mind, I take
the confidence to make an Oblation
of my Discourses to Your Lordship.
And though You have sometimes in∣timated
Your averseness to see Your
Name in Print, yet I presume to
prefix it to these Papers, which have
the Sacred Writings (for which Your
Lordship hath so great an Esteem)
for their ground-work. On this ac∣count,
I hope they will not be unac∣ceptable,

notwithstanding their Mean∣ness
and Faultiness otherwise. Fi∣nally,
begging Your Lordship's Par∣don
for this Prolix Trouble, I lay
this Offering, with my self, at Your
Lordship's Feet, and crave the ho∣nour
to be esteemed,
My LORD,
