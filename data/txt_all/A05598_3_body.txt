LOe heere (braue Prince) I striue thy Worth to prayse,
But cannot touch, the least of thy Desertes;
I showe good-will, let brauer Spirits rayse,
Thy Name, thy Worth, thy Greatnesse, and good partes:
Late famous Henry, did not leaue the earth,
(The Heauens esteem'd the Earth too base for him)
Till thou his second selfe, in blood, in birth,
Hadst strength to his most Princely parts to clim:
Sweet youth, in whome, thy Grandsires worth reuiues,
And noble vertues, are renew'd againe,
In Thee, the hope, of that Succession liues:
VVhose braue beginning, cannot ende in vaine.
Most hopefull Image, of thy vertuous Sire,
And greatest Hope, of that renowned Race,
These Unite Kingdomes, limite thy desire,
From seeking Conquest, in a Forraine place.
This Noble Yle yeeldes matter in such store,
For thy braue Sprite, to gaine a glorious Name:
And rayse thy State, all Europe yeeldes no more,
Heere stay, and striue, to match thy Fathers Fame.
VVho knowes, but thou, resembling him in face,
Mayst one day liue, to equall him in Place?
So euer Happie Prince, I humblie bring,
This Eccho of Farewell, Farewell I sing.
