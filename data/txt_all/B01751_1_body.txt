GOD who hath made your High∣nesse a Prince, shall by his grace, as we hope, one day make you a king, yea and more, which shall be like a rich Diamond on the top of your crowne, A DEFENDER of the Faith: It is now time for you to begin to be busie, to learne to stirre the rudder, before Yee be made a pilot, to undertake the great charge, even the government of three king∣domes: For this great, worthy and weighty worke, Yee have great need to be wise, but so it is,Prov. 1.7 that the feare of the LORD is the beginning of wisedome; All other wisedome without this, is but follie.
It was a good saying, that King Da∣vid said to Prince Solomon his sonne, If thou seeke him,1 Chro. 28.9. he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever: The best
 way to learne your Princely Lessons, to consider well the life and death of ki who have ruled among Gods people, wh vertues and vices are set downe by G own pen, to be followed, or else to avoided.
For such ends I have penned this poe of most mens lives in Scripture with  best uses I have beene able to make th of, which heere I dedicate to your H¦nesse in all humilitie, as being my M¦mite.
Accept of this little with my bl¦sing, an old Servant of GOD, n drawing neere my threescore.
From GLASGOW, the 28 of MAY, 1644.
