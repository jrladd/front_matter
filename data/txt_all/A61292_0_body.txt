THou, whose sole Name all Passions doth comâˆ£prize,
Youngest and Eldest of the Deities,
Born without Parents, whose unbounded Raign
Moves the firm Eearth, fixeth the floating Main,
Inverts the Course of Heav'n; and from the Deep
Awakes those Souls that in dark Lethe sleep,
By thy mysterious Chains seeking t'unite
Once more, the long-since torn Hermaphrodite.
He who thy willing Pris'ner long was vow'd
And uncompell'd beneath thy Scepter bow'd,
Returns at last in thy soft Fetters bound,
With Victory, though not with Freedom crown'd:
And, of his Dangers past a grateful Signe,
Suspends this Tablet at thy numerous Shrine.
