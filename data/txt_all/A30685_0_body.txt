My Lord,
THE Translator of this
ingenious and most use∣ful
Piece not survi∣ving
to see it publish'd, upon
Perusal of the Copy, I found,
the excellent Performance and
Merit of the Work did not
only deserve just Care of the
Impression, but also some Emi∣nent

Person to Recommend its
Appearance in the World. I
embrac'd the Opportunity I had
often wish'd, of expressing in
some measure, my Respect and
Zeal for your Lordship; where∣in
I do but Comply with all Ad∣mirers
of true Worth and Ho∣nour.
Every Body will allow,
that a better Guardian could
not be Chosen for this posthu∣mous
Offspring; and your Lord∣ship
will easily pardon my im∣ploring
your Protection of an
Orphan. The Historical Part
of this Treatise is so Iust and
Exact, and the Remarques in
it discover so much of Observa∣tion,

Experience and Iudgment,
that it seem'd a proper Offering
for your Lordship's Acceptance;
who are particularly happy in
a sensible and just manner of
Thinking. Nor has your Lord∣ships
Felicity Terminated in a
true Discerning of Things; you
have reduc'd your Sentiments
to Practice, and prov'd the Iust∣ness
of your Notions, by a sin∣gular
and constant Regularity
in your Life. You have here∣by
brought an Accession of Re∣putation
to the memory of your
Noble Ancestors, by preserving
each Virtue of theirs with its
utmost Lustre, even in a vici∣ous

Age. You continue to con∣vince
the World, that Tempe∣rance
and Conversation, Ma∣nagement
and Liberality, are
consistent Virtues. Prudence,
Iustice and Charity have carry'd
an Ascendant in the whole
Course of your Actions. You
have not only been happy in ha∣ving
early made Choice of a
good Principle to direct you;
but in a constant Adherence to
its Dictates. You were from
hence instructed to express, up∣on
all Occasions, a Hearty and
Noble Concern for your Coun∣try,
which is the true and an∣cient
Test of English Worth;

and I must do our Country the
Right to say, they are highly
sensible of it; as appears by that
worthy and just Character which
is universally given of my Lord
Bolingbrooke. Your Relati∣ons
and Friends have the next
share in your Kindness; and
among the latter, I may truly
Rank all Persons of Merit.
You have declin'd no Opportu∣nity
of Obliging any Man of
Desert, and through your whole
Life, have not given Occasion
to make so much as One Man
your Enemy. Wherefore I am
safe in what I have said of
your Lordship, and the World

will only forgive my saying so
little, in consideration of that
Modesty which is Conspicuous
amongst your Other Virtues.
Wherefore I shall only beg Par∣don
for surprising you with this
Address, and Permission to sub∣scribe
my self, among the rest
of your Admirers,
My Lord,
