PArdon me (my gratious good Lord,
and deare Prince) if out of a loyall heart
I present vnto your Princely viewe,
what I conceiued vpon these late inten∣ded
Treasons, in solace of my soule, af∣ter
the Lord had made the land so glori∣ous
by deliuerance: I say Deliuerance
out of the hands of cruell enemies, who
strooke at our fairest tree, to haue cut it downe: both roote,
bole, and branches, if the Lord had not beene propitious.
And because your excellency is the highest straine in all
expectance, and Heire apparant to that Crowne and digni∣tie,
whose vndoubted right, they haue so wronged by sini∣ster
thought, word, and worke, as in former ages the like
was neuer deuised in any Nation, nor (by the grace of God)
euer shall. I haue made bold in these fewe leaues, and lines,
to lay open the danger, with the deliuerance; and the rather
to your Highnesse: for that in feeling sort, you may iustly
say, Quorum pars magna fui; I haue had my part of both: for
man hath endangered me, but God hath diliuered me. If in
the deliuerie and proiect of this my speech, your Highnesse
shall find lesse Method, then Matter, I hope your clemency
will beare with my passionate heart, more affected to grieue
for them, who deuised the mischiefe, & to ioy for our selues
that missed it, then I can well expresse without a troubled
stile. One saith well, Vt luctus sic laetia, loquntur leues, ingentes
stupent. As are our sorrows, so is our-solace, in their medio∣crities:
they speake, but in their extremities they are silent,

and say nothing. What maruell then: if this our rauish∣ment
of so great ioy for the deliuerie, and deepe griefe of
horror because of the danger: either enioyne me silence, or
if I speake, make me to vtter my thoughts with such passion
as little passeth of the Method, so it meete with matter, to
expresse the meaning of a melting heart, Nescit ordinem a∣mor,
Loue is lawlesse: and a loue thus boiling, how can it but
shed ouer, & keep no current, other then in your Royal ac∣ceptance,
euer seasoned with such heauenly sufferance, as is
gracious both to God & man: Digna prorsus & rara virtus,
humilitas honorata; It is a rare vertue when humilitie is ho∣noured,
and honour is humbled: the blaze whereof I saw in
your Princely countenance, when at your Highnesse
Court at Saint Iames, it pleased your excellencie to licke p
the dust of the Sanctuarie there, (vpon the Lords day:) and
after the Sermon ended, to yeeld such grace in publicke to
the Preacher, as that he might kisse your Princely hand:
which euer sithence hath strucke so great an impression of
exceeding loue, and loialtie in my poore heart, as by the
grace of God, I shall neuer leaue to pray for your High∣nesse,
as I am most bounden: and also by all meanes, studie,
how either my loue, or life, may expresse the seruice and
dutie I owe for so gracious an aspect. Gold and siluer I
haue none: such as I haue, I giue: in the name of Iesus Christ
of Nazareth, be you established. Yet if it please your good
grace to receiue this simple New-yeares gift, with the least
acceptance, and as the first fruit of my labours in your high∣nesse
seruice: It may be I shall with Ianus, looke backward
to the old yeare, & out of my smal store, offer a pearle of an
higher price. Til when, and euer, I pray God safely to keepe
your Royall person, to his glory, your owne comfort▪ and
Englands ioy.
