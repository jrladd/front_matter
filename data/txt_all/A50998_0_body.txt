May it please your Lordship,
THere is no question to be made, but that the Grand Enemies both of His Majesties Person and Government, did believe that their Party had been sufficiently prevalent in England to have tram∣pled upon Persons, whom they had render'd friendless and impoverish'd in Ireland. Where Authority had made a League with Greatness, and cover'd all it's faults; as if the Earl of Tyrone could not be Guilty, because he was a Person of so high a degree Kindred, Friends, Relations, Tenants and De∣pendants all assisted Him; but the Detectours of his Conspiracies, had not one Patron to take them into his Protection. England they soon found
deeply apprehensive of the Dangers that threatned one of the fairest Kingdoms of the British Monarchy. And certainly it could not choose but be an Extraordinary Consolation of their former discouragements to meet with, here, so many Eminent and worthy Patriots, Personages of chief renown and Dignitie, so readily giving ear to, and so judicially weighing and examining the discoveries of their Loyalty. For my own part, it was not only known to me, for It was known to all the Christian World, how con∣spicuous your Lordship had alwaies been for your indefatigable Zeal, and Vigilance over the safety of His Ma∣jesties most Sacred Person, and the welfare of the whole Extent of His Dominions.
This I observed to be the reason why so many of His Majesties Loyal En∣glish Subjects made their Addresses to your Lordship. And if I among the Irish am not the first that have pressed to implore the Countenance of your Lordships favour, it was only the want of a happy Opportunity to
render my self capable of so high an Honour. To which if now I pre∣sume to aspire, I hope it will prove an argument, that I firmly intend to maintain and justifie my Information, and therebyin some measure to make my self worthy of that Noble Title of being.
My LORD,
