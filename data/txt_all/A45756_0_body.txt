SIR,
YOu may perceive by these Additionals to your large Letter, vvhich you vvrote to gratifie my desires, that the Publique hath been benefited by your Communications, vvhich vvas all that I intended, by setting you upon that worke: nor will you repent of the paines I hope which you have taken this way. For you see that your Open-hartedness in this kind hath provoked another Friend of mine of very pub∣lique desert in the Common-wealth of Learning, to impart un∣to me his Observations of the same nature. And although his Annotations now and then, are Animadversions rather then Enlargements, yet it is not unprofitable to the Publique, nor disadvantageous to us; that our errours and mistakes (for who can pretend to be without them:) be laid open and recti∣fied. I suppose you would be as loath as I, that any by your meanes or mine, should be led into a by-way, and instead of gaining become a loser, in making triall of what we offer for his advantage. I could wish that my worthy Friend who hath imparted these his thoughts unto me in the following extempo∣rary Letters, had spared some expressions; & bin less censorious a∣gainst the Persons of some, of whom others have a high and ho∣norable opinion, as Helmont & Glauber▪ but he is to be born with all in this, as we would be borne with all by him and others; in the freedome which we might take of giving our opinions con∣cerning his failings. Also I am confident, that that learned Gentleman is not interessed by any prejudice of passion, or personall disaffection against any of them; but that as a man of a free spirit he doth give his judgement through his zeal and love to every truth as it lies in his apprehension; let every one have his freedome in things which are well meant for the Pub∣like; and the best way to rectifie one anothers mistakes, will be to strive to set each other a Copy, of better and more mo∣derate expressions in the like Cases, wherein there may be a mistake or failing: If we were skilfull to provoke one another, onely to the affections of love and of good workes; and by





our own usefull experiments discreetly dispensed towards the Publique, could draw forth the profitable (but buried) skill of others, unto common use to be imparted unto all; what could not be done for ease of the poor, and the relief of common cala∣mities? Truly, although neither God by his directions how to make use of all his gifts; nor Nature his handmaid by her supplies of things necessary and comfortable for our livelihood are wanting to us. Yet we by the untowardnesse of our spirits, and the shutting up of our bowels, and the enviousnesse of our dispositions, bring a scarcity upon our selves, and upon others, whil'st we are not faithfull and liberall stewards of our talents, for the benefit of those, for whose sake God hath be∣stowed them upon us: therefore I shall desire you, as you have begun, to continue in well doing, for you know the promise, that in due time you shall reap the fruit of all your labours, if you faint not. And least you should imagine, that you are at this distance forgotten by us, give me leave to present you with a∣nother taske proper for your thoughts in the place where now you are, that the advantages of Nature, which God hath be∣stowed upon Ireland, may not lie undiscovered, and without improvement, at this season vvherein the Replanting of the vvast and desolate places of that Countrey, is seriously laid to heart by many: I shall therefore desire you to look upon this Alphabet of Interrogatories, and consider vvhat Ansvvers your Observations vvill afford unto them; or vvhat you can learne from the Observations of others to clear them; and as you have opportunity, do, as my Friend from Paris hath done; fur∣nish me vvith vvhat Gods providence shall send unto your hands, that as I have begun, I may put it out to use: and requite you more plentifully, as I hope I shall be able to do, vvith the increase, vvhich it shall yield, by this vvay of Trading, vvhich I have taken up freely to bestovv my paines and cost upon others, that all may see the goodness of God in the vvorks of his hands, and have cause to be thankfull unto him for the same, and that so many eminent talents vvhich God hath put into your hands, may not (seeing he hath given you a heart to use them) lye idle for vvant of Objects, and sit Commodities vvherevvithall to be trading vvith him, vvho subscribes himself alvvays, SIR,
