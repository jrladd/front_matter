MADAM,
THis Princess of Cyprus, in Gratitude for the Honour you did her, whilst she was Dres∣sing in her English Apparell, (For you were pleased to grace her History with the accepta∣tion of my prime Intention
and promise that her Loves and Misfortunes should visit our tumultuous World under the serene Auspice of your Protection) now implores the Security of that Glory; That (whilst she makes her Progress through this Land) she may triumph in such a Favour to an utter Stranger; who hereafter (in recompence for your pious Hospitality) will report your Worths to the Italian Ladies, and consecrate eternal Pyra∣mids to your meritorions Me∣mory, when she returns into her own Kingdom. I must also (Madam) give you Thanks for your too kind Approbation of
my poor Endevour to doe her service: But the Favor lies in your own unparalleld Good∣ness, whose excellent Spirit is replete with as many of the sublimest vertues as your beau∣tifull body is composed of Re∣gall and noble Bloods, deriv'd to you from illustrious Fami∣lies of England and Ireland. My best of Friends, Colonell Edward Stamford, gave me the Author, and intreated me to teach him our Language; The Dedication was therefore due to him: but he is Owner of so much Courtship, as (without offence) to give place to a La∣dy. So beseeching you (Ma∣dam)
to accept graciously this small testimony of my Thank∣fulness for your Civilities to this Cyprian Princess, whom I have waited on into England; and kissing your Hand for your Curtesie to me, who pre∣sent her to remain under the Palace of your Tuition; I sub∣scribe my self from my Hand and Heart
(MADAM)
