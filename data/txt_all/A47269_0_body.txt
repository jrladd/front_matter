AFter mature deliberation,
what to tender unto your
acceptance worthy your Pa∣tronage,
noting occurred more proba∣ble
than this small Manual; which
was once esteemed a rich Cabinet of
knowledge, by a person truly Honou∣rable.
May it auspiciously proure
but your Honourable friendly Esti∣mation,
and then I doubt not, but it
will find an universal acceptance
amongst persons of greatest Eminency.
Sure I am, it may be justly deemed as
a rich Magazine of experience, ha∣ving
since taught the world its ap∣proved
excellency, yea, even in many

dangerous exigencies. All I humbly
crave for the present is, my boldness
may be favourably excused; since
'twas my lawful ambition, thereby
to avoid ingratitude, for the many
singular favours I have already re∣ceived
from your endeared truly Ho∣nourable
Husband, my always true
noble Friend, and most happy Coun∣try-man.
God multiply his blessings
upon all your noble Family, and
make you no less honourable here
on Earth, than eternally happy here∣after;
which shall be the daily prayer
of him: whose highest Emulation,
is,
