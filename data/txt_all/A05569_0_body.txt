RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL: The manyfolde Curtesies, which it hath pleased you from time to time to multiply vpon mee, haue made me so greatly beholden vnto you, that they can neuer dye, but remaine fresh in my remem∣brance during my Life: So that I must enforce my selfe with all my best Endeuours openly to acknow∣ledge the same, and by all the meanes that possibly I can, to bee thankefull for them; otherwise I might iustly be noted with the blacke spotte of Ingratitude, the most odious vice that can raigne amongst men: which vice to auoyde, I haue studied earnestly to finde out some way, wherby I might make knowne vnto your Worship that duetifull reuerence and af∣fection, which I owe vnto you in that respect. But hauing hitherto had no fit oportunitie or good occa∣sion to declare the same, I haue beene constrayned

to remaine in this debt, vntill now at last it hath plea∣sed God to offer me a meane which I hope will not be displeasing vnto you. About a Tweluemonth agoe, a learned Gentleman brought vnto mee the Voyages and Nauigation of John Huyghen van Linschoten into the Indies written in the Dutche Tongue, which he wished might be translated into our Language, because hee thought it would be not onely delightfull, but also very commodious for our English Nation. Vpon this commendation and o∣pinion, I procured the Translation thereof accor∣dingly, and so thought good to publish the same in Print, to the ende it might bee made common and knowen to euery body. And calling to minde the vsuall custome of Writers and Printers in these daies, who do commonly shelter and shrowde their works vnder the credit of some such as are able to Patronize the same, your Worship represented it selfe before mee, and did (as it were of right) challenge the Pa∣tronage hereof, as being a Matter that appertaineth to your Iurisdiction. For this Dutchman arriuing here in England after his long trauell and Nauigation, and bringing rare Intelligences with him from Forreyne parts, good reason it is that hee should bee examined by such as are in place and Authority appointed for such purposes. And to whome can hee be directed better then to your selfe, whome it hath pleased her most excellent Maiestie to authorize for Iudge in Sea matters and Admirall causes. And therefore I haue brought him vnto you, with earnest request, that you will be pleased to examine him accordingly, and if you shall finde him any way beneficiall to our

Countrey and Countrey men, vouchsafe him your good countenance, and giue him such intertainment as he shall deserue. Thus am I bold with your wor∣ship to acknowledge my dutie after this homely manner, hauing none other meane to shew my selfe thankefull, but by presenting you with this slender fruite of my abilitie & facultie, which I beseech you to accept in good part, and I shall not cease to pray to God, that hee will blesse you with long life, and pros∣perous health, to the great comfort of many her Maiesties Subiects and Suppliants that are daylie to bee relieued by your good meanes.
