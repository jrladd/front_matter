AS none but a faithfull friend, can perfectlie con∣ceiue of those requisites, which truly belong vnto his friend: So none but a Father, can rightlie coniecture of that sur∣passing loue, which a fa∣ther beareth to his owne child.
This loue of mine (my Sonne,) hath made me ouer-bold with mine owne businesse, and with mine owne conuenient pleasures; in borrowing
some houres (which were indeede owing to my publike imployments and to my necessarie re∣creation) to compose, and to write this ensuing Discourse; not to please my selfe, (if it were praise∣worthie) but to doe you good: and (by such Mo∣tiues, and by such Instructions, as are therein com∣prised) to enrich your vnderstanding and behaui∣our, with those selected virtues, and most commen∣ded qualities, whose discourse it doth containe.
For like as the fairest building, wanteth her chiefest beautie, except it bee exactlie flourished, and bountifullie furnished within: so the outward lineaments of the bodie, are depriued of their choisest, and of their chiefest luster, if the inward parts and mind bee not adorned, with such splen∣dent virtues, and with such Gentleman-like qua∣lities, as doe make a man to bee compleat, and consequentlie, a profitable member in the Com∣mon-weale.
J say, a profitable member in the Common∣weale; because it sufficeth not, that a man doth know much, and can doe well, by meanes of that knowledge; except he also doe produce into action, such effects as his virtues and his knowledge haue
enabled him to performe. For, otherwise, such a man may fitlie be compared, to a rare and perfect Diamond, which beeing vnpollished, serueth for no vse. Or to a faire Ship, loaden with Silkes, with Spices, and with Gold, beeing swallowed vp into the Seas mawe, whereby it is made of no value or esteeme. For a recompence therefore, of these my labours, and in thankefulnesse, for my loue towards you, I wish and doe aduise you, to imploy some times, not onely to reade this dis∣course often, but also with diligence to meditate, and publikelie to exercise those virtues, and those qualities, which heerein are deseruedlie praised, and commended.
Especially and aboue the rest, those two, which cannot too much bee applauded: I meane Religion, and honestie of life: which (as good Salt) will season, whatsoeuer you take in hand: And will (as the South and the North Pole Starres) direct your course aright, whereso∣euer you chance to saile, in the troublesome Ocean of this your worldly and transitorie pil∣grimage: So shall your life bee profitable vn∣to others, and pleasing to your quiet conscience:
And so shall your death bee crowned with me∣rited praise and commendation; and both your life, and your death shall bee precious in the sight of God: Who will reward euerie man according to his workes, be they good or euill.
