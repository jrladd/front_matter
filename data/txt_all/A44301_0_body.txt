ACcording to my Pro∣mise to your Lord∣ships, I have given a large Historical Narrative of the Sheriffs Accompts for the

Annual Revenue of their Countries: Wherein some things may occurr that may be usefull to the understan∣ding of the Sheriffs Ac∣compts, and many other old obscure Records, and some things incidently o∣pened that have been for∣merly obscure and scarce intelligible, yet fit to be known. Some things also relating to the diffrence be∣tween the Auditors of the Revenue, and the Officers of the Pipe. There may be some mistakes of my own, I confess, in a matter of so great intricacy, perplexity and obsoleteness, which I could not easily correct, in the Country, because many

of my Papers are at London that concern this business, and, I fear, hardly to be retrieved into a due order, in regard of the late distrac∣tion. And here may be some mistakes in the Tran∣scriber, which at this dis∣tance I could not examine. But, possibly, notwithstand∣ing these mistakes, Your Lordships may find some∣thing that may be usefull, and when I wait upon you I shall review and correct.
