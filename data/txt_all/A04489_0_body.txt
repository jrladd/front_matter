BY youre last letter / dere brother in Christ / I perceved / that youre desyre was / to have the lytle worke which ye sent / wele examened / and diligently put into prynt. Which thynge (the bōde of cha∣rite / Ioh. xv where with not alonly you ād I / but we with the whole nombre of Christis cho∣sen flocke / remaynge amonge oure nacion of englisshe mē / are knet together / purly for the truthes sake pondered) I coulde do no lesse but fulfill and accōplysshe. For as mo∣che as it is a thynge so necessary. Where of no doute / shall sprynge grett frute vnto the fāmisshed / and lyght vnto theym which of lōge seasō have bene sore blyndfolded.Ma. xxv Th∣ough the rāmysshe resydue of gotes / so far re envred with man̄is blynde reason (wh∣ich repute grett felicite to make men beleve / goode to be the naturall cause of evill / dark∣nes to procede oute of light / and lyinge to

be grownded in trouth / Mat. xxiiij. and to make of the worde of lyfe the glave of death / contrary to all trueth) that scripture calleth theym faul∣ce teachers / and bryngers in prevely of da∣mpnable sectes / ij. pe. j.ij evē denyinge the lorde that bought theym / and brynge on their owne heddes swyfte dampnacion / for their lead∣ynge of many into their dampnable waies.ap. xviij Ma. vij Of whose boddies annd soules thus once blynded and ledde out of the narowe waye of lyfe / into the broade waye of perdicion / thorowe covetousnes they make their mar∣chandyse.ij.

Yet.ij. Pet. j I neverthelesse with you / doinge a∣fter the apostles erudicion / as longe as I folowe no decevable fables / ij. Pe. jij will not be ne∣gligēt

to put my brethren in remembraun∣ce (thogh they partly knowe them their sel∣ves / and are stablysshed in the present tru∣eth) of those thynges wherby they maye the more evidētly note the disceatfulnes of mor¦tall man / and the better come vnto the kno∣wledge of the im̄ortall god.

I therfore cōsyderynge the wor∣lde thus to be wrapped in mysery and blin∣dnes (ād now ī these latter dayes becom an hole or denne of falce foxy hipocrites / and a manciō for all ravenynge wolves disgysed in lambes skynnes / which hate all love / and with oute drede of god wander but for thei¦re praye) have iudged it a thynge moste con¦veniēt / to sett this smale treatous as a glas or myroure most cleare before all mens ey∣es.
