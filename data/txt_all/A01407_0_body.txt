THe worthinesse (good Captaine) of your de∣merits, with the benefit of your friendly cur∣tesies, incites mee to make profer vnto you of this my vnpolished Pamphlet, humbly intrea∣ting you to vouchsafe it acceptance, in that a∣mongst many whom I haue knowne, I could finde none more meete for the patronizing it then your self. Which if it please you, I hope it wil be the better welcom to others for your sake: and if vnconstant fortune do but once more enable me for better, then shall you find a gratefull minde ready to re∣quite you with a double guerdeon for your former kindnesse. Thus crauing pardon for this my rash attempt, I humbly take my leaue this 25. of Nouember, 1596.
