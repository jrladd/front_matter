I Wrote several years ago, when amongst us Affaires were very turbu∣lent, a Dialogue of the Right of the Scots Kings, wherein I endeavoured to explain from the very beginning (if I may so say) what Right, or what Authority both Kings and People have one with ano∣ther.

Which book, when for that time it seemed somewhat profitable, as shut∣ting the mouths of some, who more by importunat clamours at that time, than what was right, inveighed against the course of affaires, requiring they might be levelled according to the rule of right reason; but matters being somewhat more peaceable, I also having laid down my armes, very willingly devoted my self to publick concord. Now having late∣ly fallen upon that disputation, which I found amongst my papers, and perceiv∣ing therein many things which might be necessary for your age (especially you being placed in that part of humane af∣faires) I though good to publish it, that it might be a standing witness of mine af∣fection towards you, and admonish you of your duty towards your Subjects. Now many things perswaded me that this my endeavour should not be in vain: es∣pecially your age not yet corrupted by prave opinions, and inclination far a∣bove your years for undertaking all heroi∣call and noble attempts, spontaneously

making haste thereunto, and not only your promptitude in obeying your Instru∣ctors and Governours, but all such as give you sound admonition, and your judg∣ment and diligence in examining affaires, so that no mans authority can have much weight with you, unless it be confirmed by probable reason. I do perceive also, that you by a certain natural instinct do so much abhorre flattery, which is the nurse of Tyranny, and a most grievous plague of a Kingdome, so as you do hate the Court solaecismes & barbarismes no less, than those that seeme to censure all ele∣gancy, do love and affect such things, & every where in discouse spread abroad, as the sawce thereof, these titles of Majesty, Highness, and many other unsavoury compellations. Now albeit your good natural disposition, & sound instructions, wherein you have been principled, may at present draw you away from falling into this errour, yet I am forced to be some what jealous of you, lest bad company, the fawning foster-mother of all vices, draw aside your soft and tender mind into the

worst part; especially seeing I am not ig∣norant, how easily our other senses yeeld to seduction. This book therefore I have sent unto you to be not only your monitor, but also an importunat and bold Exactor, which in this your tender and flexible years may conduct you in safety from the rocks of flattery, and not only may admonish you, but also keep you in the way you are once entred into: and if at any time you deviat, it may reprehend and draw you back, the which if you obey, you shall for your self and for all your Subjects acquire tranquillity and peace in this life, and eternal glory in the life to come. Farewell, From Stirveling, the tenth day of January in the year of mans salvation one thousand five hun∣dred seventy nine.
