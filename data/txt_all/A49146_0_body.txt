My Lord,
YOVR Lordship whose Greatness
is to be in Arms, will know how
useful a virtue Ambition is, and for∣give
my pride who desire to be the first
who shall lay something at Your feet.
This Treatise was written to instruct
the present French King when Dau∣phin
in the choice of History, and to
recommend to him the Ancient Wri∣ters,
who must needs be the best, be∣cause
they treat of the Ancient virtue.

Your Lordship is the hopes of our Age,
and 'tis the interest of all that Your
tender years should be seasoned with
the Love of that Noble study, in the
Greek and Roman Historians. Your
Lordship will see what you have to do
to be a Hero, but Your Lordship can∣not
have a better example of Great∣ness
than Your Princely Father, who
is bold in War, calm in Councel, tem∣perate
in Peace, and who like Scipio,
is a perfect Commander in the very
Spring of his Youth, but this is too
great a Subject for me though none
more admires his Virtues, and more
firmly beleives Your Lordship will
succeed to all his Glory, than
My Lord
