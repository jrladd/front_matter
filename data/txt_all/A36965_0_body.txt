DON Quixote having not only been well Receiv'd upon the Stge, but also having clear'd himself with Reputation▪ from the Slunder and Prejudice which malicious Criticks hd resolv'd pon, to ully and blast him; I could not forbear suffer∣ing him to aspie to this Second Honour of Dedicating himself to your GRACE, from whose Noble and unbyass'd Iudgment, he may assure himself of an Obliging Reception, and a Generous Security.
The Honour your Grace, and the rest of the Nobility and Gentry did me to see this Play in its Rehearsal or Undress, was a happy presage of its future good fortune; the Stars were all in conjunction to do me good; and I think I may safely say, without offence, That when the Ladies came to my Third Day, there never was at this time o'th' year, in the Hemisphere of the Play-house, so dazling and numerou a Constellation seen before.
'Tis, Madm, from your GRACE's prosperous Influence that I Date my good Fortune; and I shall be very glad if this poor Off-spring of my Brain, has Merit enough to deserve the Honour of a Smile from so Great and so Good a Patronesse.
Further, I dare not proceed on this Subject, lest I should involve my self rashly, in praise of what is even too great for praise it self, and so only shew my own Ambition, in aspiring to write on so Glorious a Theme, withot doing you any Iustice, who are always infinitely above what ever my Genius can ever pretend to in that Nature.
The World, that knows the Noble Stock from which you sprung, are sensible that 'tis impossible for you to derogate from such flourishing and signaliz'd Virtues; And those likewise that consider you, as the Happy



Consort of the Great ORMOND, whose indefatigable Zeal to Serve His Majesty, and his afflicted Country, with his dearest Blood and Fortune abroad, leaves him scarce leisure to dry your Tears up for the last Parting, or pay his Paternal Blessing to his dear Chil∣dren at home, ought to behold your Grace with doubl Reverence, and unite their Prayers and Wishes, that all things in his Absence may tend to your Comfort, satisfaction, and Honour; and that the troublesome Hours may run swiftly off, to give way to the ransporting News of his Happy Return with Fame and Victory.
One of these general Admirers of both your Matchless Leserts and Virtues, I beseech your Grace to believe me, whose Dutious Wishes are constantly Devoted to your ervice—And now particuarly, may the whole Hierarchy of Angels protect ye in the expected Hour of Trouble; and may the Rejoycing Worthy Part o'th' Worl be Blest th another Noble, Loyal, and Valiant OSSORY reat and Admir'd as his Illustrious, and never to be forgotten Grandfather. And that this unvalu'd Blessing, and all other that can make your Grace, and that Truly Noble, and most Dearly Lov'd Heroe abroad, Happy in one another; May Succeed as your Desire, is the Devotion and daily Wish
Of MADAM,
