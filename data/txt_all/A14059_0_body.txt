MOst mighthe and renoumed Prin∣cesse / after that I had made an end of ye third parte of my Herbal / which intreateth of these herbes / whereof is no mention made nether of ye old Grecianes nor Latines / & had ouer∣sene agayne my first parte / and both correc∣ted it and encreased it very muche / and had also corrected the seconde parte: and the Prin¦ter had geuen me warninge / there wanted nothinge to the settinge oute of my hole Her∣bal / sauing only a Preface / wherein I might require some both mighty and learned Pa∣tron to defend my laboures against spitefull & enuious enemies to al men∣nis doynges sauing their owne / and declare my good minde to him that I am most bound vnto by dedicating and geuing these my poore labours vn¦to him. I did seke out euerye where in my mind / howe that I coulde come by suche a Patron as had both learning & sufficient autoritie / ioyned there∣with to defend my poore labours against their aduersaries / and in the same person suche frendshippe and good will towardes me / by reason whereof I were most bound vnto aboue all other. After longe turninge this matter ouer in my mind / it came to my memorye that in all the hole realme of En∣gland / that there were none more fit to be Patronesse of my Booke / and none had deserued so muche / to whom I should dedicate & geue the same as your most excellent sublimitie hath done: I haue dedicated it therefore vnto your most excellent sublimitie / and do geue it for the auoydinge of all suspicion of ingratitude or vnkindnes vnto you as a token and a witnes of the acknowledginge of the great benefites that I haue receyued of your Princelye liberalitie of late yeares. As for the supremitie of your power / might and autoritie in this realme / there are none that will denye it / sauing onlye the bewitched hipocrites and bound men of the spiritual Babylon. As for your knowledge in the Latin tonge xviij. yeares ago or more / I had in the Duke of Somersettes house (beynge his Physition at that tyme) a good tryal thereof / when as it pleased your grace to speake Latin vnto me: for although I haue both in England / lowe and highe Germanye / and o∣ther places of my longe traueil and pelgrimage / neuer spake with any no∣ble or gentle woman / that spake so wel and so much congrue fyne & pure
 Latin / as your grace did vnto me so longe ago: sence whiche tyme howe muche and wounderfullye ye haue proceded in the knowledge of the La∣tin tonge / and also profited in the Greke / Frenche and Italian tongues and others also / and in all partes of Philosophie and good learninge / not onlye your owne faythfull subiectes / beynge far from all suspicion of flattery bear witnes / but also strangers / men of great learninge in their bokes set out in the Latin tonge / geue honorable testimonye. As touchinge the benefites that I haue receyued in of your Mayestie / I must confesse that for the ob∣teininge of certeyne surites and defendinge of my selfe agaynst them that troubled me vniustelye / ye haue at the lest four tymes holpen me with your letters patentes / sealed with the great seale of Englande / and also re∣stored me vnto the denerye of Welles / both by the depriuation of the vsur∣per of it / that held me out / and admittinge of me as onlye the lawfull dea∣ne of Welles by your appoynted commissioners and iudges delegate a∣gayne. Wherefore your Mayestie hath largelye deserued to haue a greate deale worthier gifte for the greatnes and manifoldnes of the benefites that ye haue bestowed vpon me youre poore subiecte. But although euen as I thinke my selfe it be but a small present in comparison of your worthines state / dignitie and degre / and benefites towardes me: Yet my good will considered / and the profit that maye come to all youre subiectes by it / it is not so small as my aduersaries paraduenture will esteme it: For some of them will saye / seynge that I graunte that I haue gathered this booke of so manye writers / that I offer vnto you an heape of other mennis labou∣res / and nothinge of myne owne / and that I goo about to make me fren∣des with other mennis trauayles / and that a booke intreatinge onelye of trees / herbes and wedes / and shrubbes / is not a mete present for a prince. To whom I aunswere / that if the honye that the bees gather out of so ma¦nye floure of herbes / shrubbes / and trees / that are growing in other men∣nis medowes / feldes and closes: maye iustelye be called the bees honye: and Plinies booke de naturali historia maye be called his booke / allthough he haue gathered it oute of so manye good writers whom he vouchsaueth to name in the beginninge of his worke: So maye I call it that I haue learned and gathered of manye good autoures not without great laboure and payne my booke / and namelye because I haue handled no one Autor / so as a craftie couetous and Popishe printer handled me of late / who sup∣pressing my name / and leuinge oute my Preface / set oute a booke (that I set out of Welles / and had corrected not without some laboure and coste) with his Preface / as though the booke had bene his owne. For I am able to proue by good witnesses that I haue aboue thyrtye yeares ago / written an Herbal in Latin / wherein were conteyned the Greke / Latin and En∣glish names of so many herbes and trees as I coulde get anye knowledge of / euen beyng yet felow of Penbroke hall in Cambridge / wher as I could learne neuer one Greke / nether Latin / nor English name / euen amongest the Phisiciones of anye herbe or tre / suche was the ignorance in simples at that tyme / and as yet there was no Englishe Herbal but one / al full of vn∣learned cacographees and falselye naminge of herbes / and as then had ne∣ther Fuchsius / nether Matthiolus / nether Tragus written of herbes in Latin. And before that Fuchsius had written his Herball / and set it out / I went into Italie / and there learned of the lyuinge voyce of my maysters di¦uerse
 herbes / which Fuchsius neuer sawe / the knowledge of certeine wher¦of after I returned out of Italie / did communicate vnto him in a long Epi¦stel / wherein I dyd frendlie admonishe him of certeyne erroures that were in his herball / which was then newly set out / and within not many yeares after I wrote the first parte of my English Herball / and dedicated it vnto my Lord and Maister the Duke of Somerset / so that I borrowed verye littel or ellis nothinge of Matthiolus / and when as the Herball of Mat∣thiolus came out in Latine / manye thinges that were thought straunge both vnto English men and Germanes / were nether straunge nor vnkno∣wen vnto me / because I had learned the same before of my maisters in Ita¦lye / and namelye of Lucas Gynus / the reder of Dioscorides in Bonony / of whom Matthiolus in his Herbal in many places acknowledgeth / that he learned diuerse and sundrye herbes to him vnknowen before: Yet do I graunt yt of his Herbal I learned somthinge / but not so addicte vnto him / but that I wrote against him in some partes of my Herbal / where as I thought he erred / and they that haue red the first part of my Herbal / & haue compared my writinges of plantes with those thinges that Matthiolus / Fuchsius / Tragus / and Dodoneus wrote in ye firste editiones of their Her¦balles / maye easely perceyue that I taught the truthe of certeyne plantes / whiche these aboue named writers either knew not at al / or ellis erred in thē greatlye / as in Absinthio pontico / Orobāche / Betonica Pault / Sphon∣dylio / & diuerse others. So yt as I learned something of them / so they ether might or did learne somthinge of me agayne / as their second editions maye testifye. And because I would not be lyke vnto a cryer yt cryeth a loste horse in the marketh / & telleth all the markes and tokens that he hath / & yet ne∣uer sawe the horse / nether coulde knowe the horse if he sawe him: I wente into Italye and into diuerse partes of Germany / to knowe and se the her∣bes my selfe / and to knowe by practise their powers and workinge / not tru¦stinge onlye to the olde herbe wiues and apothecaryes (as manye Physi∣ciones haue done of late yeres) but in the mater of simples myne owne ey∣es and knowledge: wherefore I haue somthinge of myne owne to present and geue vnto your highnes. And where as they saye that a booke of we∣des or grasse (as some in despite of learninge will call precious herbes) is a righte vnmete gift for suche a Prince as all men confesse you to be / I aun∣swere that if the noble Poet Virgil sayd well and truelye:
Si canimus syluas, syluae sunt consule dignae, I maye also iustelye saye / 
Si canimus plantas, plantae sunt principe dignae. For the knowledge of herbes / trees and shrubbes / is not onelye verye delec¦table for a Princis minde / but profitable for all the bodies of the Princis hole Realme both to preserue men from sicknes / sorowe and payne that commeth thereby / and also from poison and death / but also necessarye for Phisiciones & apothecaries wtout ye knowlege whereof they can not deuly exercise their office and vocation where vnto they are called / for howe can he be a good artificer that neither knoweth the names of hys toles / ne∣ther the toles themselfes when he seeth. Wherefore it maye please your gra¦ces gentlenes to take these my labours in good worthe / not according vnto
 their vnworthines / but accordinge vnto my good mind and will / offering and geuinge them vnto you / whiche thinge if I can perceyue to come to passe / so that I maye haue rest and quietnes in my olde age / and defence from my enemies / whiche haue more then these eight yeares continuallye troubled me verye muche / and holden me from my Booke / and sicknes wil suffer me / I extend to set out a Booke of the names and natures of fishes that are within youre Mayesties dominions / to the great delite of noble men / and profit of your hole Realme. Almightye God / whose rome ye occupye here in earth vnder his sonne Iesus Christe / pre∣serue and kepe you from all your ennemies / both spiritual and bodelye.
From my house at London in the crossed Fryers the 5. daye of Marche. 1568.
