I Haue aduentured this meane worke to your learned Censure, onely with a longing desire to make my loue to you legible: and I was the more incoura∣ged, in that I knew you would read with Patience; for I assure my selfe you will forget no Vertue. Yet since I expect for but a bewraying witnesse of mine idle houres, so great a priui∣ledge as your graue Patronage, I must acknowledge my selfe guilty of inex∣cusable
presumption, that so the con∣fession of my fault may plead for some fauour, although not altogether for pardon. I can say little for my selfe but this, that if I haue here done amisse, I promise all my endeuours for amend∣ment hereafter. In the meane time I wish I had done better, and more for your sake, then myne owne. For I ho∣nour your worth, and account it a hap∣pinesse to preserue your Loue.
