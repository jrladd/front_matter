Most Honored Sir,
THe store of a good Scribe is (according to our Saui∣our) both old and new; J would (if J durst) be am∣bitious of this onely honor; hauing therefore drawne forth these not-friuolous thoughts, out of the old Te∣stament, I fetch these following from the new; God is the same in both; as the body differs not with the age of the sute, with the change of robes: The olde and new wine of holy Truth, came both out of one vineyard; yet here may wee safely say to the Word of his Father, as was said to the Bridegroome of Cana, Thou hast kept the best wine till the last; The authority of both is equally sacred; the vse admits no lesse difference, than is betwixt a Sauiour fore-shadowed, and come. The intermission of those mili∣tary imployments, which haue won you iust honor, both in forraine nations, and at home, is in this only gainefull, that it yeelds you lea∣sure to these happy thoughts, which shall more fully acquaint you with him that is at once the God of Hosts, & the Prince of Peace: To the furtherance whereof these my poore labours shall doe no thankelesse offices. In lieu of your noble fauours to me both at home, and where you haue merited command, nothing can bee returned but humble acknowledgements, and hearty prayers for the increase of your Honor, and all happinesse to your selfe, and your thrice-wor∣thy and vertuous Lady, by him that is deepely obliged, and truely deuoted to you both,
