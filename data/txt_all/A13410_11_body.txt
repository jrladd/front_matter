Most Worthy Lord:
IF for your gracious fauours vnto mee,
My loue and seruice can e're make amends,
Both are at your dispose, and you shall see,
I'll ranke your name, amongst my noble friends,
And no dishonor to your Honor, for
I bring not th'offring of a monitor,
But of one that wonld be admonished,
At your dispose (you are as'twere my head.
Learn'd Prince of Preachers, whose celestiall voyce,
Contracts a King to willing audience,
Accep't these lines, and I'll maintaine my choyce,
Is the true Image of true excellence:

'Tis inward ioy to mee, to see men note,
Me clothed in a shed of Chester scoate,
It is a robe of honor, and maintain'd,
By Chesters Lord vnwronged, and vnstain'd,
My gracious Lord mistake me not, I do
Present with reuerence, and humility,
These to your Lordshp, they belong vnto
Your Honor onely: Not presumptuously,
I eternize your name, but with regard,
And your free Patronage, is my reward,
Bestow it then, and for your share doth rest,
Both all my all, and of my all the best.
