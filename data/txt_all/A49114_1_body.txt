Honoured Sir,
I Have made my Dedication, laying down my self, and all my poor endeavours, at the feet of Jesus Christ, my great Master: And having payed my vowes, I come now to pay my debts, or rather (be∣cause they are greater then I can satisfie) to make my acknowledgement, presenting this Pepper-corn to your hand. All the hope that I have of your acceptance, is, because I have intitled you to a righteous cause, and such as can plead for it self. No eminency of learn∣ing or authority can give any opponent so great advantage against him that pleadeth the cause of Christ, is the truth and goodness of that cause can administer to him that de∣fends it against all opposers, be they never so numerous, or clamorous: And yet (Worthy

Sir) lest the weakness of the Advocate should seem to prejudice the cause, I have chosen to plead it mostly in the Language, and Arguments of men, as famous for ex∣cellent learning and exemplary Pietie, as any this Age can boast of; And I am sure too, that there are many Persons alive of that Character, who will readily appear and plead for it still: but if all should for∣sake it, if all should oppose it, Our great Master can plead his own Cause, and I doubt nor Sir, but you will be of his Coun∣cel; and then though the Solicitor be an Ignoramus, yet there is no fear of the Ver∣dict.
And thus having done my devoir, and told the world that no man on Earth hath better Title to my Labours then your self, I beseech the God of Heaven to make you as eminent in Spiritual, as you are in Tempo∣rall blessings, that the inner man may pros∣per as the outward doth. So prayeth
