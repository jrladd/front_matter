MADAME,
THis world is full of people, whose religion is compounded like the TURKISH, in part CHRISTIAN, in part IEVV, in part WORLD∣LING, in part ATHEIST, in part as A grippa, almost Christians: Only these are happie, who according to the Apostle his wish,Act. 26 29. are altogether Christians.
A time of tryall will come, which shall discerne almost from altogether: Happie shall these professours bee, to whom the Lord shall say,Luke 22 28. Yee are these which have continued with me in my tem∣ptations; and I appoint unto you a kingdome,vers. 29. as my Father hath appointed unto me,vers. 30. that yee may eate and drink at my table in my kingdome; of all honours this shall be found the greatest.
GOD, Madame, hath highly honoured your La. both with grace and place: As for grace, yee may without flatterie, with S. Iohns Lady, be called the ELECT LADY:2 Iohn 1 As for place, Yee both by birth and marriage are high, but highest in this, that your La. art humble.
I will not heere enter into a large dis∣course, concerning the Noble and Potent Earle your La. Husband, whose vertues have most Oriently shined in our generall Assem∣bly, which his Lordship did much ho∣nour with his presence, and help with his counsell.
That which the Apostle did require for the house of Onesiphorus, that I most heartily wish to his Lordship, to your La. and to all your noble Line and Fami∣lie,2 Tim. 1.18. that the Lord grant that yee may finde mercy of the Lord in that day.
Let it please your La. graciously to accept of this little labour, and to honour it with your favour, it shall bee but an EAR∣NEST of more, if I live, and if God permit.
From Glasgow the 14. of Ianuar, 1639.
