MADAME, As God in the first creation of one made two, so in the first institution of marriage did he againe vnite those same two into one, that the woman ioyned in marriage with her husband, might not onely reuerence him, as the rocke from whence she was taken, but much more loue and honour him as her head, vnder whom she liues. If they had not agreed in one, to diuide themselues from God, no diuision had euer fallen out among themselues. But that which God made very good, Sathan working vpon the mutability of their will turned into euill; so that the woman in stead of an helper, became a tempter of the man to sinne, and the man in stead of a defender, became a dilater of the woman to God for sinne. But the Lord Iesus, who came into the world, to destroy the workes of the Diuell, as he hath reconciled man and wo∣man with God, so hath he reunited them among themselues, ad∣ding this to all the former bands of their vnion, that now they should liue together as heires of the grace of life. In this most happy vnion of both your Maiesties with God and among your selues, consists your mutuall strength and comfort, the welfare of your Highnesse royall children, the terrour of your enemies,
 and common benefit of all your Maiesties well affected subiects. A good so much the more carefully to be kept, because Sathan out of all doubt spitefully doth enuie it, as being the very foun∣taine, out of which doth flow that great and common good, both of your royall posterity, and loyall people, the aspect of your High∣nesse fauourable countenances looking in loue one of you to ano∣ther, and both of your maiesties in coniunct compassion to your people, sweeter than the influence of the vndiuided Pleiades, bringing to Church & common-wealth, vnder your happy raigne a flourishing spring of innumerable blessings. We doe therefore blesse the Lord who hath confirmed your royall hearts, and set it in the for most of your godly cares, how to keepe and encrease this holy and happy band of loue which keepeth you both. For the continuance whereof, as after my weake measure, I stand vp a daily supplicant vnto the Lord, among others your Highnesse loyall subiects, so doe I humbly craue that your Highnesse impute it not to me for presumption, that I haue conioyned your maie∣sties in the participation of this small propine of the first fruits of my labours, whom I doe wish for euer to be conioyned in the com∣munion of all good present, and to come: but that rather accor∣ding to your Highnesse wonted fauour and clemencie toward me, your maiestie would graciously accept it, as a testimonie of my earnest and vnsained affection toward your Highnesse name and honour in this life, and euerlasting welfare in the life to come.
