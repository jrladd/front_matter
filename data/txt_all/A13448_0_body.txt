TO whom should I these sorrowes recoÌ„mend,
But vnto you, the Citties noble freind:
I know, you are much grieued with their Griefe,
And would adventure life for their reliefe,
To you therefore these lines I dedicate,
Wherein their sorrowes partly I relate,
I humbly craue acceptance at your hand,
And rest
Your seruant euer to command,
