SIR,
AMong all the Noble Presages of Wit, and Honour, there is not one by which YOUR HIGH∣NESS hath given greater Encourage∣ment to the Hopes of these Kingdoms, than by a surprizing Curiosity, and an impatient Desire of Knowledge. For the satisfying of so Generous Inclinations, YOUR HIGHNESS cannot but
seek an early Acquaintance with the Roman State. It must needs please YOU, SIR, to understand the Consti∣tution of that People, before YOU ap∣pear the Rival of their Glory: And the first Steps to both these Attainments will be alike uneasie. Many Fatigues are to be undergone ere YOU surpass them in Action and Conduct: And in the same Manner, before YOU are intro∣duc'd into the more delightful Scenes of their Policy and Government, YOUR HIGHNESS should be first pre∣sented with the rougher Prospect of their Customs and Ceremonies.
For Your Direction in so Noble (tho' so Intricate) a Path of Ancient Sto∣ry, YOUR HIGHNESS is desir'd to accept this small Endeavour; no otherwise than YOU would a few Sha∣dows or a little Model, to give YOU, SIR, the first Notion of some admir'd Picture, or some magnificent Build∣ing.

There is one Custom which I am apt to fansie YOUR HIGHNESS will read with particular Pleasure; I mean, SIR, the TROJAN GAME; a Martial Exercise, perform'd by the Youth of the first Quatity in Rome, un∣der such a Captain as Your self: And deriving its Original from young Asca∣nius, whom I need not fear to mention as your Precedent, since YOU have already honour'd Him with your Imi∣tation.
It may be expected perhaps that out of the many Illustrious Romans, I should here propose to YOUR HIGHNESS some of the most Celebrated Examples of Virtue and great Atchievements. But this would prove a needless Piece of Service; since YOU cannot miss Your Way in the pursuit of the First, while YOUR HIGHNESS go's on like the Trojan Prince,
Matre Deâ monstrante viam.

And to the Other, the short Advice which that Hero gave his Son, will en∣gage YOU as the Highest Motive:
—Te animo repetentem exempla tuorum
Et Pater Aeneas & Avunculus excitet Hector.
