PYthagoras was i'th right, Lucian's again.
Reviv'd, we find, in your more happy strain;
For herein only we acknowledge odds
Your witty Dialogue reviles no Gods;
But with free mirth comes bravely to engage
And lash the Follies of a Brainsick age;
Now Learning and Religion wasted lye
'Twixt pious Non-sense and wild Drollery
Your harmless Joques correct our Ignorance
And wise Physitian-like in complaisance
To coy depraved Pallats, guild 'ore still
With pleasant, Gayeties your salubrious Pill
A Dish so Cook'd all Appetites will fit
Deep Notions intermixt with sprightly wit
Envy must grant this composition rare
A Rabbins learning, and a Poets Air;
Those that from grave Discourses fly away
You to good Lessons unawares betray
The Splay-mouth'd Brother, and his melting Mate
In this Glass view themselves, and blushing hate
Henceforwards all these darling Fopperies
They therefore so zealously did prize
Blew-Apron'd Levites, Fortunetelling Quacks
Emptie scull'd Gallants, cheating what-de? lacks
All here Arraign'd, hold up their guilty hand
And for their several crimes receive the brand.


Let supercilious Cato's then stand by
With their morose affrightning Gravity
Whilst we with thanks applaud your Art that know
At once to profit, and delight us too.
