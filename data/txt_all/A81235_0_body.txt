Sir,
I Thank you for the favor you did me in affording me a sight of your Pa∣pers; I had heard much of your notions con∣cerning afflictions, and there∣fore was very thirsty till you were pleased to give me to drink of the fountain: I can now say as that Queen,
1 Kin. 10.7 The one half was not told me; fame came much short of taste: We
are perfect in no Lessons so much as those into which God whippeth us; and can∣not speak of any argument so warmly and feelingly, as when we speak out of present expe∣rience: To treat of afflictions when we our selves flourish and abound in ease and plen∣ty, savoreth more of the Ora∣tor then the Preacher, the brain then the heart: Certainly guess and imagination cannot be so good a midwife to such con∣ceptions as sense and feeling.
It seemeth when you went into prison, the Spirit of God went into prison with you; and when you were shut up to others, you still lay open to the visits and free breathings of his grace; the restraints and enclosures of a prison cannot prejudice the freedom of his
operations: He is a close pri∣soner indeed that is shut up not only from the society of men, but converse with the Holy Ghost. I begin to see there is somewhat more then a strain and reach of wit in Tertullians consolatory discourse to the Martyrs:
Caetera a∣nimi impe∣dimenta us∣que ad li∣men carce∣ris deduxe∣rint vos, quousque & parentes vestri, ex∣inde segre∣gati estis a mundo nec hoc vos con∣sternet quod segregati est is a mun∣do, si enim recogitemus ipsum ma∣gis mundum carcerem esse; exisse vos e car∣cere quam in carcerem introisse in∣telligemus majores te∣nebras ha∣bet mundus graviores catenas in∣duit mun∣dus, &c. Tertul. ac Martyr. You went out of prison (saith he) when you went into it, and were but sequestred from the world, that you might converse with God; the greatest prisoners and the most guilty are those that are at large, darkened with ignorance, chained with lusts, committed not by the Pro∣consul, but God, &c. The Lord often manifested himself to his Prophets in a Wilderness, and to you in your secession and retirement.
Sir, I could even envy your Prison-comforts, and the sweet
opportunities of a religious privacy: We that are abroad are harrassed and worn out with constant publike labors, and can seldom retire from the distraction of business for such free converse with God and our own Souls: But we are not to choose our own portion; crosses will come soon enough without wishing for them; and if we were wise we might make an advantage of every condition.
Good Sir, be perswaded to publish those Discourses; the Subject is useful, and your manner of handling it warm and affectionate; do not de∣prive the world of the com∣fort of your Experiences: Certainly my heart is none of the tenderest; yet if heart an∣swereth heart, I can easily fore∣see
much success, and that you will not repent of the publica∣tion: The Lord bless your endeavors in the Gospel of his dear Son: I am, Sir,
