MEN, as the Philosopher saith, Most Noble Sir, are rude, barbarous, and worthy of nothing but Contempt, unless their Natures be refined by Learning and Knowledg; a main Instrument for the attaining whereof is History; which, as the Learned Livy saith, Hoc illa praecipuè agit in rerum cognitione salubre et frugiferum, omnis te exempli documenta in illu∣stri posita monumento, intueri, unde Tibi tuae{que} Rei∣pub: quod imites capias, unde foedum incaeptu, foedum exitu, quod vites: This I take to be meant by him in general of History; which, without offence of the more Learned, I hope may be extended to the various

Discourses of particular Countries; especially such, whose near vicinity, as to Friendship or Enmity, is requisite to be known, as well in its greatness, as mean beginning: A Wise-man ought not to find fault with those things, which he sees written, because he doth not approve there∣of, but rather will set a high esteem thereon, because others are experienced in those things whereof he is ignorant; wherein the Candor of your Lordships Judgment appears glorious, as using to try all things rather by the measure of unerring Truth, than the deceitful Fancy of a byassed Judgment.
The famous Author Hugo Grotius, though eminent for Learning in his Country, and by his own Repute able to bear up against the Malevolent Blusters of Envy, yet were his Posthume Works glad to crave the Protection of Superiours, by whose Approbation, they have gone through the World, meriting the highest Applause. And there∣fore, I humbly hope, the unworthiness of the Translator, in his being unknown to your Honour, will not in any measure lessen the well-known Repute of the Author, whose Impartial Pen, hath with that Candor deliver'd his Countrey-mens Actions, as gives not the Credit of their Greatness, to their own Policy or Strength, but yields a deserved Lawrel to the honour of the English, whose Aid was not onely as a Hand to uphold, but a vi∣vifying Medicine to a fainting Body, that recals and gives new Spirit to a formless and cadaverous Lump. I shall not trouble your Lordship with the Reasons inducing to this Translation at this time, as well-knowing it would be too great an Intrenchment upon the full Occasions, which hardly afford your Honour any time of Repose:

And therefore I humbly crave your Lordships Pardon, for this bold Intrusion, beseeching your favourable Re∣spect to Patronize this Translation, which I prostrate to you, as the most hopeful Stem of Rising Nobility, as being replete with all the Advantages flowing from a large and plentiful Fortune; wherewith not onely your Body is enriched, but your Mind copiously embelished, with all the Helps both of Art and Nature. Accept then hereof, and make it receive a value, if not from its own Worth, yet from your Approbation: Which that it may do, is the Desire of,
MY LORD,
