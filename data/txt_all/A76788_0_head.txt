To my dearly beloved Country-men of Engâˆ£land, and to all of what Country soever, namely, to all such as love the true, onely glorious, and blessed God, and endeavor unfeignedly to do his Will, to such as have obtained like precious faith with us; Grace, Mercy, and Peace be to you, through the acknowledging of God, and of Jesus Christ our Lord.
