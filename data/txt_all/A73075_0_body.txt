THE due regard which good men haue of you, for the spe∣ciall gifts with which it hath pleased God to grace you, the long experience of your Chri∣stian fauour; your willingnes to read, and wisedome to iudge and discerne of all that you read: hath made me bold to offer vnto your Worship, this testimony of my vn∣fained thankefulnesse, and to craue your fauourable patronage for the same. For I euer esteemed an vnprofitable life, to bee a kinde of vncomfortable death. For the matter and manner, I recommend it to the censure of the conscionable and iudicious

Readers; which will bee so much the more beneuolent, because it shelters it selfe vnder your name. And thus beseeching Almigh∣tie God, to blesse your faithfull indeuours in that high calling, and daily more and more to multiply his gracious mercies vp∣on your self, and your godly and vertuous Lady, I humbly take my leaue,
