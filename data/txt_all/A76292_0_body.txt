VVEre these but worthless Poems, or light Rimes,
Writ by some common scribler of the Times,
Without your leave I durst not then engage
You, to ennoble 'em by your patronage;
But these though Orphans, and left Fatherlesse,
Their rich endowments show they do possesse
A Fathers blessing; whom the Fates thought fit
To make a Master of a Mine of wit:
Whose ravishing conceits do towre so high,
As if his Quill had dropt from Mercury:
But when his fancy chanc'd of love to sing,
You'd sweare his Pen were plum'd from Cupids wing;
He doth an amorous passion so discover,
As if (save Beaumont) none had ere been Lover;
Some praise a manly bounty, some incline
More to applaud the vertues feminine;
Some severall graces in both Sexes hid,
But only Beaumont's, he alone that did
By a rare stratagem of wit connex
What's choice and excellent in either Sex.
Then cherish (Sir) these Saplings, whose each straine,
Speakes them the issue of brave Beaumonts braine;
Which made me thus dare to prefix your name,
Which will, if ought can, adde unto their fame.
I am, Sir,
