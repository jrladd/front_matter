AS there is a method and order to be ob∣serued in all artes, for the practitioners more fa∣cile attayning the effects of his endeuours: so is there no lesse vniformity to be propounded in ayming at the true course of vertue: the rules whereof, albeit they are directorie to the sum of all happinesse, yet do worldly courser studies entertaine far more followers, whose erring iudgements (entangled with dull ignorance) cannot rightly preferre vertue, nor effectually censure vice. For what cleare
 sighted iudgement will rely e∣ternall affaires vpon the gli∣ding slippernesse and running streame of this vncertaine life? or who (but one of distempered wits) would offer to dissemble with the Amightie decipherer of all thoughts, in pretending vertue, and pursuing vanitie? It is a most seruile disposition that will yeeld the prerogatiue of the soule vnto the body, and giue flesh and bloud libertie to determine the course of this life, which are in manner but the barke and rinde of a man, being that the soule is the so∣ueraigne part, ordained to an high end of so peerelesse digni∣tie, and such estimate, that not all the gold and treasure of the world, nor anything in heauen of lesse worth then the bloud and life of Almighty God, was
 able to buy it.
Let vs not then iniuriously depriue our soules of the due in∣terest of grace and vertue, but account this vaine world with the wares thereof sutable to the shop of idle Marchandise, vnto which we haue already beene too long customers, the trafficke being toile, the wealth trash, the gaine miserie, and the whole contents thereof detriments in grace, pietie, and vertue.
