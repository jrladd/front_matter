TO whom, vnder
God, should these
vowed teares hum∣bly
addresse them∣selues?
but vnto
you three (thrice excellēt Prin¦ces)

the neerest partakers, and
most hopefull repairers of the
great and common losse that
caused them.
A losse indeed, common to
vs the members of this State
and Church, with all the faith∣full
inhabitants of the Christi∣an
world: But to expresse the
greatnesse of it, What shall wee
take to witnesse for it? what shall
wee compare to it?Lamen. 2. 13 Whereto shall
wee liken it? A breach great like
the sea: who can heale it? who can
comfort vs in it?
But blessed bee the Father of
mercies, and God of all comfort,
that hath not onely preserued
vnto vs of this age, the royall

root and stemme: but also in you
the princely branches, reserued
a treasury of hope & comfort
for the generations ensuing.
Only, being taught by so
heauy an hand,Ierem. 3 23 that the hope of
the hils, and multitude of moun∣taines
is but vaine, except the
Lord be sought vnto as the on∣ly
health of Israel. What shall we
say? but the Lord giue vs hearts
so to repay vnto your Excellen∣cies,
the arrerages of praiers
and thanks, wherein wee are
behind hand to your Princely
Brother; that God may be plea∣sed
to repaire by you, the losse
that in him we haue sustained.
So may wee hope, that the

God of mercy the strength of
Israel will answer vs with words
of peace and truth,Ester 9. 30 saying:
Vnto our Soueraigne your
royal father,Psal. 89. 19. I haue laid help vpō
one that is mighty: I haue exalted
one chosen out of the people, &c.
Vnto you illustrious Prince
Charles,2. Sam. 23. 3 Thou sbalt beare rule
ouer men, being iust and ruling in
the feare of God.
Vnto you gracious Lady, I
will blesse thee,Gen. 17. 16 and thou shalt bee
the mother of Nations, Kings also
of people shall come of thee.
Finally, vnto you happie
Prince, and sent of God to in∣crease
our happinesse, Come in
thou blessed of the Lord,Gen. 24. 31 for whom

the choisest pearle in the Chri∣stian
world is by God himself
prepared.Ruth. 4. 11 The Lord make her
like Leah and like Rahel, which
two builded the house of Israel.
Let her grow into thousand thou∣sands,Gen. 24. 60
and let her seed possesse the
gate of his Enemies.
What remaineth, most gra∣cious
Princes? but that, with
humble suite, for pardon of
this boldnes, and acceptance
of this poore seruice, offred
(in the name of this famous
and loiall Citie) vnto the ho∣norable
memory of your tri∣umphant
Brother, and patro∣nage
of your Princely Graces:
I tender vnto your Highnesses

two requests, of an heart zea∣lously
deuoted, both to your
present honour, and euerla∣sting
blisse.
The first, that you would al∣waies
set before your eies, the
Princely patterne of vertue
and pietie, so happily expres∣sed
in the example of that bles∣sod
Soule, whom the world was
no longer worthy to enioy: who
beginning as Iosiah did,2. Chro. 34. 3. from
his tender yeeres, to seeke after
the God of his fathers, hath now
left a sweet (though mourne∣full)
memory, of his graces a∣mongst
vs,(Ecclus 49. 1) like the composition
of the perfume made by the art of
the Apothecary.

The second, that you would
often and seriously meditate
vpon that hoauenly counsel,
giuen by the holiest King that
euer raigned, that man after
Gods own heart, vnto his sonne
the wisest Prince that euer li∣ued;
and therefore well be fit∣ting
your graces Greatnesse:
And thou Solomon,1. Chro. 28. 9 my sonne,
know thou the God of thy Father,
& serue him with a perfect heart,
and with a willing mind: for the
Lord searcheth all hearts, and
vnderstandeth all the imagina∣tions
of thoughts: if thou seeke
him, he will be found of thee, but if
thou forsake him, he will cast thee
off for euer.

Which, if your Graces shall
please to apply, as spoken by
God himselfe to each of you,
I haue all which my soule
herein affecteth; which shall
neuer cease to call vpon the
Lord for the continuance of
the sure mercies of Dauid, vpon
our dread Soueraigne with our
gracious Queene your roiall
Parents, and vpon your ex∣cellent
Highnesses, that you
may long remaine the com∣fort
of their roial Maiesties, and
crowne of vs their well affe∣cted
subiects.
