SIR;
AS Aeneas after seven Years tossing and tumbling up∣on
 the impetuous Billows of the angry and enraged Sea (Per Syrtes
 & inhospita saxa) was at last so happy as to cast Anchor in his
 long-wish'd for Harbour, (Sedes ubi Fata quietas osten∣dunt;) So I
 having some Years crossed the Ocean of History, (where likewise I have
 been crossed by Storms and contrary Winds and Tides) at last have sheltered my
 Weather-beaten Historicall-Ship, under the Lee-shore of a knowing and
 honourable Patron. I have adventured also to secure this
 Chronologicall Cock-Boat under the Cliffe of your Protection,
 being throughly acquainted with your Worth, Ingenuity, and Learning. That
 Latin-Piece you set me upon, wherein I shew how farr short the
 Latin Poets are of Virgill, is not as yet come to perfection;
 in the interim I was desirous, as an  earnest of that, to present
 you with this Piece; not doubting but ere long I shall be able to give a full
 account of my Pains in the other; So with a thank∣full recognition of your
 Favours towards me, I take leave, and will ever be found

(SIR)
