Gentlemen,
THE style of the Paper, in which you sent me your joint and earnest Re∣quest to publish this Discourse, was so respectful and obliging, that I could not deny it without incurring the imputation of
Rudeness, especially seing it was the first Request, of any Kind, that you ever desired of me.
I need not tell the world, how Loyal you are, nor how Active some of you have been in Re∣forming this City, the very Ap∣proving of this Sermon, which all the Enemies of the Govern∣ment will be sure to Condemn, is a sufficient Testification, that you are some of those Worthy Citizens, who in the late distin∣guishing Times were too honest, and too wise to be misled by those subtle and malicious Ene∣mies of the Monarchy, who are generally known by this Cha∣racter, that they are for the King against his Evil Counsellors, and for the Protestant Religion against the Church.

I was very much pleased, as well as surprized, to find at my arrival on the Evening of the An∣niversary Day of our most Gra∣cious Soveraigns Birth, and hap∣py Return, that this City, now restored to its self, had prepared to celebrate that Auspicious day in a most Solemn, and Festival manner; and I must bear you and your Loyal Citizens witness, that I never saw more Conduct and Order in any Publick Pro∣cession, more Gravity in any Publick Joy, or more universal Temperance, and Sobriety at any Publick Feasting among all Sorts of Persons, exactly agreeable to that seasonable Exhortation, with which I concluded this Sermon, which now is no longer mine, but Yours. I am very sensible it de∣serves
not half of that great Opi∣nion, which you have expressed of it, and if it answer those Ends, but in any tolerable and compe∣tent measure, for which you desi∣red me to make it publick, espe∣cially among the People of this Ci∣ty, to whom I am bound to have a particular regard, I shall think my pains well spent, and rejoyce that I was so happy, as to testify in a way so serviceable to the Publick that I am.
