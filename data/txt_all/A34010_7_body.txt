My LORD,
THE great Complaisance, and endearing Civility, with which your Lordship treateth those who have the Honor of your Acquaintance, giveth me the Confidence, and you the Trou∣ble of this Paper, speaking my Ambition to be farther known to your Lordship, in presenting you with my most Humble Duty,
Place this Sheet before the Preface of the Tables. and mean Sentiments which cannot Contri∣bute
any thing to the advancement of your great Knowledge; All that I can pretend to in this Humble Address to your Lordship, in reference to my Boldness, is to receive a fa∣vourable Pardon, as well as an Honourable Protection: The intrinsick Honour of your great reality, and most amicable Dispo∣sition, render me highly a Votary to your Lordship, for whom I have most Reverential, and Affectionate Esteems, and shall ever deem my Self very much Honoured to improve my utmost endeavours in your Service.
Your Lordship hath travail'd through many Countreys be∣yond the Seas, and made many Observations upon the va∣rious Governments of several Republicks and Kingdoms, and have not only studied Books, but Men, and have Learned the Virtues (and not the Vices of other Nations,) giving a Lustre to your Honourable Personage and Fortune, which you have made very Renowned in great Hospitality, by Caressing your Friends with a Noble and Kind Enter∣tainment, the high Expresses of your most entire Love, which you have much more enobled by your Piety to God, in Obedience to his Holy Laws revealed in his Word, and in Justice to your Neighbour, in the strict observance of his Sanction and Golden Rule in the Gospel, Whatso∣ever ye would that Men should do to you, do you to them; And in sobriety to your own Person, in regulating your Appetites according to the more refined Dictates of rectified Reason.

And now I cannot conceal your other Moral Perfe∣ctions, as first your great Loyalty and Veneration of the KING, our most Gracious Soveraign (whom God long preserve) with an high Reverence and Duty, as Gods Vice∣gerent.
And your Lordship hath a high Value and Affection for the Ministers of the Gospel, and their Sacred Office, and chiefly for the Function of Bishops, as Ecclesiastical Gover∣nors, Instituted by the Holy Apostles, that all things in the Church may be done Decently, and in Order, and to Reform the irregular Lives of unreasonable Men.
And your Lordship is not only a Loyal Subject of His Majesty, and true Son of the church, but a faithful Friend too (of which I have had very much experience) who study all ways possible in all good Offices of Love and Kindness, to promote the Interest and Happiness of your Acquaintance, and have a due Resentment of any civilities paid to your Lordship, who are very prone upon all occasi∣ons to speak your grateful Returns by way of Compensa∣tion.
I have reason to believe I have long presumed upon your Patience, for which I humbly beg your Lordships Pardon; in recounting your Perfections, which I have performed in all sincerity, out of a Principle of Justice (without any Flat∣tery)
in propounding you a great Exemplar for others to Love, Admire, and Imitate.
My Lord, to your Goodness, as great in Honour, and to your Honour, as great in Goodness; are Humbly presented this Free-will Offering, and the Author; and no Votary Can do more then make his Heart an Oblation, as Ambiti∣ous to bear the Name and Attribute, of being,
My LORD,
