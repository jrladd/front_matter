GOod Fate, faire Thespian Deities,
And thou bright God, whose golden Eies,
Serue as a Mirrour to the siluer Morne,
When (in the height of Grace) she doth adorne
Her Chrystall presence, and inuites
The euer-youthfull Bromius to delights,
Sprinckling his sute of Vort with Pearle,
And (like a loose enamour'd Girle)
Ingles his cheeke; which (waxing red with shame)
Instincts the senslesse Grapes to do the same,
Till by his sweete reflection fed,
They gather spirit, and grow discoloured.


To your high influence we commend
Our following Labours, and sustend
Our mutuall palmes, prepar'd to gratulate
An honorable friend: then propagate
With your illustrate faculties
Our mentall powers; Instruct vs how to rise
In weighty Numbers, well pursu'd,
And varied from the Multitude:
Be lauish once, and plenteously profuse
Your holy waters, to our thirstie Muse,
That we may giue a Round to him
In a Castalian boule, crown'd to the brim.
