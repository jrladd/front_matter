SIR,
THE Expedition Your MAJESTY Undertook into England, to Res∣cue these Nations from Ar∣bitrary Power, and those Un∣just Invasions that were made

on our Religion, Laws, Rights and Liberties, was an Action in it Self so Great, and of such Immense Bene∣fit to our Distressed Coun∣tries, that 'tis Impossible to give it a Representation so Glorious as it Deserves. Of all Your Majesty's Kingdoms, none was more Sensible of the Happy Effects thereof, than Your Kingdom of Ireland, which from the Depth of Misery and Despair, is Rai∣sed by your Majesty to a Pro∣sperous and Flourishing Con∣dition. And we presume most humbly to Implore the Continuance of Your Maje∣sty's Graces to us, by Prote∣cting

and Defending those Rights and Liberties which we have Enjoy'd under the Crown of England for above Five Hundred Years, and which some of late do En∣deavour to Violate. Your most Excellent Majesty is the Common Indulgent Father of all your Countries; and have an Equal Regard to the Birth-Rights of all Your Children; and will not permit the Eld∣est, because the Strongest, to Encroach on the Possessions of the Younger: Especially considering with what Duty, Loyalty, and Filial Obedi∣ence, we have ever behav'd our selves to Your Majesty:

Insomuch that I take leave to Assert, That Your Maje∣sty has not in all Your Domi∣nions a People more United and Steady to Your Interests, than the Protestants of Ireland: Which has manifestly Ap∣pear'd in all our Actions and Parliamentary Proceedings, since Your Majesty's Happy Accession to the Throne. To Relieve the Distress'd, has ever been the Peculiar Character of Your Majesty's Glorious Family. The United Provinces have found this in Your Famous Ancestors: And all Europe has been Sensible of this in Your Royal Person. To this End more particu∣larly

You came into these Kingdoms, as Your Majesty has been pleas'd to Declare: And as You have Establish'd the Rights and Liberties of Eng∣land on a Foundation that, we hope, can never be shaken; So we doubt not but Your Sa∣cred Majesty will have a Tender Care of Your Poor Subjects of Ireland, who are Equally Your Subjects, as the rest of Your People.
Pardon, I most Humbly beseech Your Majesty, my Presumption, in Appealing to You on this Occasion: Nothing but the Dignity and Weight of the Subject, can

Excuse my Boldness herein: But if That be Consider'd, it Deserves the Regard of the Greatest Prince; 'Tis no less than the Rights and Li∣berties of one of His King∣doms, on which their Reli∣gion, their Property, their All Depends; and which they have Enjoyed for Five Hundred Years past. This, I think, I have clearly shewn in the following Leaves: I am sure, if my Management thereof, were suitable to the Iustice of our Cause, our Friends of England can no longer Doubt it.

At Your Majesty's Feet therefore, I throw it; and with it the Unworthy Au∣thor thereof,
(May it please Your Majesty)
