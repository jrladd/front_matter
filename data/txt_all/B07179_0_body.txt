ALTHOVGH heretofore (right wor∣shipfull) diuers and sundrye well skilled men in the feate, and science of numbring, haue not spared their labour, not onely in beautifying, but also in augmenting the same with such increase of witte, as hath excedinglye contented the studentes therein, and made them riper in the exacte knowledge and redinesse of it: Yet bicause an arte can not haue to much
 setting forthe, neither can be to much com∣mended, I (among, and after so many preg∣nant wittes) am bolde to put forth the fruit of my blunt vnderstanding and trauaile, in the like science, not correcting or reprouing anye mans former edition, but making an attempt of my grosse, and meane study here∣in, to the intent that this my enterprise may (by other mens doings) be either gently a∣mended, or frendely receiued. And bicause I desire specially that it may be gratefullye accepted, I haue chosen you (worshipfull) to be as defendours of this little lucubration, to whom I knowe it shall be welcome, not so much for my sake, as for the scien oue it selfe, wherein it is well knowen you haue ripe iudgement, and good vnderstanding, as by your daily exercises it may appere. And although some foolishe heades of fansie ouer∣thwart, think this arithmeticall arte pecu∣lier onely to a fewe vsing the trade of mar∣chaundise, as though it were not so necessa∣rye for other men: Yet I am sure, the wisest and best learned perceiuing the wonderfull arte, the deepe diuises, and the cunning cō∣clusions
 that are comprised in it: affyrme it (and that of right) to be the best whetstone, or sharpening of the witte of euery man, that euer was inuented, and thinke it most necessarye to be taught vnto children, with∣out the which, nothing either priuate or common can be well ordered. And trewe it is, that whosoeuer is ignoraunt of thys science of numbring, he slepeth in all the rest, and lacketh that promptitude of witte, which other haue in casting and accompting of great summes. Yea, I saye hee that hath the exacte knowledge of it, hath a speciall gift of GOD, and carieth about him a note and token of a good wit: and I doubt whe∣ther euer anye was counted or estemed sim∣ple or foolishe, that had this science in hys heade.
Nowe if some curious braine woulde aske mee thys question: Syr you commende much your Arte of numbring, can you tell who was the first inuentor of it, or what this worde ARITHMETICA doth signifie, I would aunswere him that it is vncertaine who inuented it firste, but well I knowe,
 it is one of the seuen liberall sciences: which if I saye God gaue vnto man to adourne his life with all, I say as it is, and as we ought to beleue, of whom we acknowledge to haue receiued them and not of the Poetes or hea∣then Goddes, as some scholemen will saye. Moreouer, I know that Abraham taught it first vnto the Egiptians, and no man will denie but that he receiued al his knowledge of God, for he worshipped no straunge Gods neither receiued anye giftes or sciences of them. And although many yeres after, Pythagoras declared it to the Greekes, yet was not he the first inuentour of it, but god. Plato also commended it as most necessary, willing it to be taught to all youth before al other thinges. And thankes be to God, it appeareth that his precept hath been verye well followed here in Englande, for I finde not in anye nation (I speake not flattering my countreymen but commending them) more ready knowledge in this science, than there is in the moste part of our youth here in Englande, and namely in London, which I seing it is in them, it is (out of question) in their maisters & tutours, which by their great care ouer them, haue trained them
 vp vnto the practise thereof, to whom the greatest part of the praise redoundeth. And now right worshipfull, when I consider how little profit my simple trauaile shall bring, being but as it were an assay of further at∣tempt, I am compelled to craue at your handes onely to accept my good will with the worke: for will and abilitie are some∣what vnequall in mee, but if abilitie were correspondent to will, I woulde gladlye plea∣sure you in greater things thā this is, which is but only a shadowe in comparison of other mens substanciall labour & trauail in this art: yet I trust it is not altogither so vnpol∣lished, but it hath passed vnder the file of some workmanship, wherby some men may take occasiō of profit & furtherāce herein, which is my chief desire, although I knowe many are able to doe better: for Englande is not so destitute of learned heades, but my doings may sone be followed, yea rather a∣mended. But yet forasmuch as I would they should knowe, that knowe not, I thought it not good to hide that which hath been ope∣ned vnto mee. And so casting with my selfe the summe of all, I desire you eftsones, right worshipful (to whom I thought it most mete
 to present the fruite of my studie) thanke∣fullye to receaue it, as your wonted wise∣domes doth all things well and vertuousely purposed.
Thus fare you well, desiring God to main∣taine you in your estate, to prosper and fur∣ther all your good purposes, all your trafficks and voyages, encrease you in vertue, and keepe you in good health. 
AMEN.
