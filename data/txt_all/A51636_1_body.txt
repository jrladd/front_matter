My most Honourable Lady:
THE last Book of this kind which I publi∣shed (the last yeare) having under your name found so good welcome at their hands into which it chanced, (sith it mended their fare with their owne food) hath now (for their further wel∣fare in the like manner) called out this Second part, as a second service to satisfie their more dainty desire: In which services, such Novelties as Time, Art, and Diligence (the Per∣fecters of each Faculty) doe daily de∣vise, may be seene and practised, to
give all contentment to the curioust palate. And this I take to be no sin∣full curiosity, but it is rather a sin to marre good meate with ill handling; and so the old proverbe verified; God sends Meat, but the Devill Cookes: what it is, (Good Madam) is altoge∣ther, with the Author, yours, though he shew it others; that so the world may be thankfull to you for good meate well drest though at their own cost: And let me lose my credit with you and the world too, if it de∣ceive their expectation, so as they cooke it by this booke. To the tryall whereof I referre them: recommen∣ding it and my selfe, to your Lady∣ships wonted favour, resting in all humble service
