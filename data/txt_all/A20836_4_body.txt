THrice noble and my gratious Lord, the loue I haue e∣uer borne to the illustrious house of Bedford, and to the honourable familie of the Harringtons, to the which by marriage your Lordship is happily vnited, hath long since deuoted my true and zealous affection to your honourable seruice, and my Poems to the protection of my noble Ladie, your Countesse; to whose seruice I was furst bequeathed, by that learnd & accomplisht gentleman sir Henry Goodere, (not long since deceased,) whose I was whilst hee was, whose patience pleased to beare with the imperfections of my heedles and vnstaied youth. That excellent and match∣lesse Gentleman, was the first cherisher of my Muse, which had beene by his death left a poore Orphan to the world, had he not before bequeathed it to that Lady whom he so deere∣ly liued. Vouchsafe then, my deere Lord, to accept this epi∣stle, which I dedicate as zealously, as (I hope) you will pa∣tronize willingly, vntill some more acceptable seruice may be witnesse of my loue to your honour,
