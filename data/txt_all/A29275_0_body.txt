GOd having taken, in taking from you the daugh∣ter
of your hopes, the onely means of earth, to
have perpetuated your Memorial, and to have
kept your Name in life among the living, when you had
layen asleep among the dead. In whose long and much
deplored absence, I think it my duty, in what I may, to
contribute that means that may help to make sweet your
Memory among the Saints; as in another kinde is was
the duty of the yonger, to raise up seed to the elder Bro∣ther:
Which service I desire may be accepted of you
both, as done of him, that (while he lives) shall gladly
wait to do you any, or all the service else he can; and
rest, praising and praying to GOD daily for you, That ye
may be saved.
