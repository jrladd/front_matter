MOst Noble young Lord, and of honourable expectation, although your yong yeares, haue scarse arriued yet to the bearing of Armes, neuerthelesse on the assured hope conceiued of your honorable parts, as so nobly each way descended, (whose vertue hath alwayes shined to the glorie of your name and house) I haue emboldened my selfe to offer vn∣to your Lordships view and protection, these Military dis∣courses, penned vpon occasion of conference had with sun∣dry Gentlemen, and by them wished to be published. Ma∣ny good reasons haue moued me to dedicate them vnto your Lordship, as well in respect of your owne vertues (resembling altogether that Noble Earle of Pembroke, your Graund∣father, and that worthie Sir Phillip Sidney your Vncle) as also in respect of the great and waightie Commandes which your Right Honourable father doth worthily hold ouer vs, in these our Westerne parts and VVales, vnder our dread Soueraigne. Such as they are, I humbly beseech your Lord∣ship to accept, as from a souldier, who humbly offereth him∣selfe and his seruice vnto your selfe, next vnto my good Queene and deare Countrie.
