May it please Your Highness,
THIS Book having been com∣pos'd
within the extent of
Your Family, I durst not
expose it abroad, before it had paid
its Homage to Your HIGHNESS,
and beggd the mighty Protection of
Your Illustrious Name. And besides,
the hopes that it may one day, be of
some use to Your HIGHNESS,
have been still a prevailing Conside∣ration




with me, to lay it at Your
Princely Feet. The French Tongue
has acquired of late so universal an
Esteem, as to be reckon'd one of the
most necessary Qualifications for all
Well-bred Persons; but is so, in a
more peculiar manner, for all Kings
and Princes in Europe: For being
link'd together, either in Consangui∣nity
or Interests, it is no less requisite
for them to agree upon a general
Language, than it is for common
Relations and Friends to understand
one another.
Some perhaps, will think it too
soon to Dedicate a Book to Your
HIGHNESS: But besides that
my undertaking is not altogether
without precedent, I may claim to be
dispensed with Rules, in writing to a
Prince, who by his early Virtues, is
Himself so extraordinary. In effect,
your HIGHNESS was no sooner




Born, but despising the common
Toys of Children, You have shewed
an eager desire of entertaining Your
blooming Wit, with what the mo
Skilful Artists have been whole Year
to invent; which Noble Desire of
Knowledge, joined with the Natural
Superiority, that even through the
Vail of Your Tender Age, appears in
all Your Words and Actions, cannot
but create in us wonder and amaze∣ment,
and raise our Hopes to the
highest and most glorious Expecta∣tions.
These, Sir, are the promising signs
that make Your Highness the dearest
Comfort and Delight of Your ROY∣AL
PARENTS, and which unite
the Hearts and Wishes of all these
Nations, who do already anticipate,
by longing Desires, the future Glory
they shall derive from Your Riper
Accomplishments.


That it may prove so, is the most
hearty and ervent Wish of him,
who has no other Ambition, no
other prospect of Honour, than to
be,
