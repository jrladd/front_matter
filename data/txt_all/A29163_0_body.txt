Gentlemen,
AS this Farewel Sermon was not barely intended for a solemn for∣mality upon quitting my employ∣ment; but was the result of sentiments both tender and serious, expressed with all imaginable sincerity and heartiness; so I flatter my self with the Belief, that your desiring me to make it publick, was some∣thing more than a ceremonious Comple∣ment, being a fresh instance of that kindness and good will, with which you have always been pleas'd to favour me.
And therefore, however fairly I might excuse my self, by the plainness and indi∣gestedness of the following Discourse; yet I cannot refuse you the absolute di∣sposal
of that which is so justly and in∣tirely your own; and shall please my self with the agreeable opinion, That your Affection to me is the cause of Pub∣lishing, what my Affection to you was the occasion of Composing.
That you may still continue stedfast and immoveable in the profession of that Faith which I have preached a∣mongst you, and always abound in that Work of the Lord, to the perfor∣mance of which I have constantly exhort∣ed you; that so, neither my Labour in Preaching, nor yours in practising, may be in vain in the Lord; shall be the earnest and continual Prayer of
Gentlemen,
