MADAM,
WEre this Present but as great as the Confidence
which makes it, I should then have assum'd
that as my Election, which now I do as my
Pennance. For Parthenissa has protested to me,
though she have been nourish'd in misfortune,
yet my Pen has been her highest; and that to
Dedicate her to any but my Lady Northum∣berland,
were to injure her as much in the address of her Adventures,
as in the Relation. Perhaps Madam, my opinion may be yours, and
that you will esteem her as guilty in her Iustice, as I am in my fault,
since the pennance she enjoyns me for one crime, is to commit a great∣er.
'Tis the respect I owe to you and to Truth, which makes me
use this expression, for I cannot write of Parthenissa so ill, but to
write to My Lady Northumberland is worse. But Madam, that you
may not conclude me a wilful offender, which seemingly I may appear,
by a knowledge of the greatest fault, and then by an election of it:
I have this to alledge in my justification, that had not the Theory of
Virtue taught me the noblest operation of it, is to pardon offences,
your practice had: For I have found you as much pleas'd in confer∣ring
on me your pardon, as I have been to receive it, or troubled
to need it. So that I cannot term that a crime in which you take
delight, nor condemn that performance which affords you any; nei∣ther
can you suspect this Truth, when for the manifestation of it, I
decline not so criminal a proof. Thus Madam, you may see I injure
you, but to do you right, and publish my transgression, but to do the
same of your Mercy. But since Parthenissa has us'd me at a contrary
rate, I shall not scruple to imitate her example, and to render her
fault as evident as she has mine: 'Tis, Madam, that she offer'd me

her pardon for this Book, if in it I would draw her Coppy by making
you my Original; but my respect and my disability render'd me unca∣pable
of the Will and Power of effecting it, neither can I better illu∣strate
the greatness of the former, than by proportionating it to that
of the latter. You would not be what you are, could I have made her
what she would be; since to render any resembling you, were to injure
you in your noblest Prerogative, and to act a crime, which Nature
has not, or rather could not perform. Besides, Madam, could I have
represented her such a perfection, I could not have committed that
offence, for which this reparation was prescrib'd, for I could not have
continu'd the Romance, since thereby my Hero's friendships must
have yielded to their Loves, and with much more reason, than their
doing so, could have been condemn'd. There is a necessity in Books
of this nature, that the Beauties in them must have some particular
charms, the one above the other, but you possess all those graces in a
more sublime perfection, than any one of them; does any one of them,
and I have heard Parthenissa profess with as much concern as truth,
that if there be any thing in the Book which bears her Name that
relishes of the Romance, 'tis only because you are not the subject of
it: Your Beauty would bring credit to more transcendent things, than
are there related, and make that which would require Faith in any
other case, appear as much Reason in yours, as that which confines
me inviolably to the highest ambition'd Title of,
MADAM▪
