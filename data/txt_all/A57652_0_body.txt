MY LORD:
ANtiquity did wittily adumbrate and represent unto us a Wise man,
by the Fiction of double faced Janus, with a Serpent by him, biting
his tail; intimating, that hereby wise men take notice, and make use both of
things pre∣sent and past; and withall are not unmindeful of their End,
ex∣pressed by the Serpent biting his tail. Now that which makes a man truly
wise, and double faced with Janus, is History of things past; without
the knowledge of which, a man hath but one face, and looks onely upon things
before him; and such are Children, saith Tully, though they be aged;
whereas History makes men ripe and aged in Knowledge, though they be children
in Years. God  hath appointed two Guides and Conductors of Mans
life, while we are Pilgrims here in this Valley of Tears; namely,
Precept and Example: The Law furnisheth us with
Precepts, History with Examples; which make our way more
short and easie then the other, as Se∣neca tells us: (Longum iter
per praecepta, breve & ef∣ficax per exempla) These two Guides are like
the two Pillars that conducted the Israelites through the Desart; and
indeed, they are both so needful, that without them, we shall never attain to
the Land of Promise, the Canaan of our Happiness. And as History is
necessary to all, so chiefly to those who are set upon the Pinacle of Ho∣nour,
whose actions are obvious to all eyes, and obnoxious to all mens censures; who
being placed upon Watch-Towers, had need of better eyes, and a longer
perspective then those who live below; Now History is the Perspective that lets
them see the danger a far off: Had it not been for the know∣ledg of History,
Lucullus the Roman had never subdued Mithridates the
King of Pontus; nor had Xanthippus the Lacedemonian
overthrown the Romans; whereas before this, the Carthaginian
Commanders, for want of Historical Knowledge, were still worsted by the
Roman Armies. In Histories great Men will find what uncertainty and
vanity there is in outward splendor; what it is that makes true and genuine
Nobility, and discriminates it from that which is supposititious and
adulterate; and it will shew them that there is no confidence to be given to
humane strength, Policy, nor Actions.

Edocet humanis quae sit fiducia rebus.
They that sit at the Helm of Government, had need of the
Historical Compass to steer by. Among other emolu∣ments which accrew to Princes
by History, they will finde them to be their truest friends, and wisest
Councellors, both in admonishing and reproving them: For this cause  Demetrius Phalerius advised King Ptolemy to read
Hi∣stories, that from them he might learn truth; For Friends, either out of
fear or shame, will not tell Princes of those faults, which History blusheth
not to demonstrate. Be∣sides, great Men receive this benefit by Historie, That
they are incited to vertuous actions, by the examples of those brave men who
went before them. So was Alexan∣der by reading the Storie of
Achilles; and Caesar by rea∣ding the Stories of
Alexander; and the Turk by rea∣ding the actions of
Caesar. Thus Aenaeas animates his Son. 

Tu facito mox quum matura adoleverit aetas
Sis memor, & te animo repetentem exempla tuorum,
Et pater Aenaeas, & avunculus excitet
 Hector. And as they are incouraged to vertuous Atchievements
by Historie; so for the same Atchievements they shall be made glorious by
Historie to all Posterity; which will be of longer continuance then Brazen or
Marble Statues: Ther∣fore Theseus was more beholding to
Connidas the Hi∣storian who wrote his life; then to Silamon
that painted, or Pharrhasius that ingraved him to the life: And for
this cause the Historian was more honored by the Athenians, then the
other two; for Statues express the Lineaments of the body onely; but Histories
demonstrate the Endow∣ments of the minde: Statues are for a time; Histories for
perpetuitie; which had Pericles known, he would rather have
entertained the Historian to register his actions, then Phidia the
Painter to Delineat his Picture fighting with the Amazon upon
Minerva's Target; which is long since lost; but the History remains.
In a word, I may call Hi∣storie with Polybius, and Aristotle,
 the truest kinde of Learning, and usefullest exercise in
the world.
Now my Lord; considering with my self, that what I 
have spoken here, is the object both of your knowledge and practice; And duely
weighing your noble extraction, your Learning, and love to learned men; your
goodness, wisdom, and affability, with those other eminent parts in you, wherin
you are nothing inferior to any of your honorable Progeni∣tors; I was ambitious
to send abroad this Piece under the shelter of your Honors Patronage, knowing
it will receive the better acceptation, if it be graced in the Frontispiece
with your Noble Titles. The chief end of this Dedica∣tion, is to shew to the
world the dutifull respect and zeal I bear to the Ancient, and Honorable Family
of the HOWARDS; and withall to your own Eminent Parts, by which you
shine among others, (Velut inter stellas Lu∣na minores.)
