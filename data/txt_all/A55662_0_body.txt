SIR,
THe fam'd Gallantry of Your Family has invited this La∣dies Addresses for Your Fa∣vour and Protection. Misery proves often, at least gains the Consi∣deration of Merit, and is never baro'd Refuge by the Brave and Generous: And since Misery and Merit concur so highly in this Lady, as to make her the Object of the Compassion of those that are the least guilty of Tenderness, no doubt but Your Hereditary Good∣ness will open her an Asyle. Her Misfortunes and her Charms afford Title sufficient for a Sanctuary; but she has still that of a Stranger to plead
on her behalf. She's sensible, so much Good-nature as You are own'd to stand possess'd of, will not require so many Qualifications for a favourable Recep∣tion: For all the noted Advantages of Your several Ancestors seem rendez∣vous'd in Your Person, tho' in each there shin'd the Qualities that make a Gallant Man. She fancies the Cir∣cumstances and Beauties of her Story to be such, as to furnish your Diver∣sion, at the same time they move Your Pity. But having Ʋsher'd her into Your Presence, I'll leave her to ac∣quaint You with her Case, and enlarge this Trouble no further than the Assurances of my being with the deepest Zeal and most profound Respect,
SIR,
