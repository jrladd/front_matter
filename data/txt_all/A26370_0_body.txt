Right Honourable,
I Here present your Honour
with a short and plain Ac∣count
of the onely great
Impostor, that ever continued so
long prosperous in the World. The
consideration of whose Mean Ori∣ginal,
Sudden Progress,
and Present Grandeur, may
justly awaken all Christian Magi∣strates
into a timely suppression of
False Teachers, though never
so despicable in their first Appea∣rance,
lest (like Mahumed)

they second Heresie with Force,
and propagate Enthusiasm with
Conquest.
If you can have leave from
your Great Affairs to peruse the
following Papers, your Honour
will find the Account they give
of Mahumed and his Doctrine,
to be free from many ridiculous
but usual Stories concerning them
both; which the present Ma∣humedans
laugh at, as the ma∣litious
Inventions of the Enemies
of their Prophet. And though
many odde things are here set
down of this Impostor, yet they are
all own'd by his Sectaries, and
urged as proofs of his Divine
Mission.

But that for which to my self I
seem least accountable, is the giving
your Honor the trouble of this Ad∣dress;
which indeed you have drawn
upon your self, by your too great
Candor and Generosity toward for∣mer
Instances of this Nature.
Besides, Accounts of this kind
ought in my judgment to be present∣ed
to Persons who have Abili∣ties
as well to Correct what is
Erroneous, as to Patronize
the Truth.
Accept this, SIR, as a sin∣cere
Testimony and Confession of
my Gratitude and Affection,
and you oblige me to be for ever
