Illustrious Ladies,
THese following Harangues are so many pillars of that Tri∣umphant Arch, erected by the skilful hands of the renow∣ned Monsieur de Scudery, to the glory of your excellent Sex; which I, not only out of those common principles of Civility, which obliges all men to render you service; and in obedi∣ence to the commands of two most noble La∣dies, which were sufficient to prompt the dul∣lest spirit; but out of that earnest desire I have to proclaim my infinite respect and veneration to your Illustrious Sex, have adventured to translate, and do now prostrate them before
you with the most profound respect that can be. And though my dis-joynted and unpolish'd version does so abate their native lustre, com∣pared to the Original, as might deserve your censure; yet when you shall be pleas'd to con∣sider of what importance it is to your fame and honour, and that none abler have yet re∣membred to undertake it; I do not believe on∣ly, that your natural sweetness will be perswa∣ded to grant a pardon, but am induced to think it were a sin to doubt of your fair acceptance. Look but on it, Illustrious Ladies, as it truly is, a glorious Trophy, composed of the Arms, Scepters, and Crowns of so many Monarchs, which your beauties have subdued; and no doubt but it will become as grateful as it is magnificent; and be received with as much delight and satisfaction, as it is tendered with desire and passion.
