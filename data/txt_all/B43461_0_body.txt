SIR,
THose whose Genius's could penetrate so deep as to com∣prehend those sublime and profound Knowledges which Your Majesty doth possess, in all that concerns Arts and Sciences, undoubtedly should not dare to bring any thing before You, but what they believe to be in the height of Perfection. Therefore I do find my self in a strange confusion, which makes me waver between the respect which I owe Your Majesty, and the Duty which I find my self obliged to render You in my WORK. For, when I consider, Sir, That Your Majesty looks on Things with eyes which are enlightned with the purest Lights of the Op∣tiques, and most regular Perspective; I cannot but condemn the defects of this present WORK to shew my respect. But, notwithstanding I cannot forbear to go on in that resolution which I have taken, to shelter them un∣der Your Majesties Protection, since therein I shew my Duty. I know, Sir, that You pick and cull out with an unparallel'd exactness, and with an extraordinary solidity of Judgment every order of Architecture, and par∣ticularly what concerns the Ornaments and Decorations of Gardens. But
 I understand also on the other side, that Your Majesty acts in all things with such a Royal and Generous bounty, That following the Example of Your Royal Predecessor, You refuse not any of those Offerings which are Presented to Your Majesty, with that zeal and sincerity which is requisite. Hence it is, Sir, that I am emboldned to Present and Dedicate to Your Majesty, that which the Study, the Experience and the Labour, which I have undergone under Your Auspices and elsewhere, have furnished me with most Remarkable, both as to what hath been observ'd from Anti∣quity, and what hath been acquired of Modern; which are found both in this Work mixt together, as my Respect and my Duty are, and shall ever be in all things which can make Appear, That I will Live and Die,
SIR,
