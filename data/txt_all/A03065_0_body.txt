MY LORD:
GOod wine needs no bush:
but this Traueller wants a
Guide, and as vnder age, a
Guardian too: In the warres
a Beard becomes a Cap∣taine,
and in trauaile yeares
doe well, at least some
yeares of discretion, to enable the looke on to

marke the most remarkable things, and those
onely.
My desire to see, tooke away my sight, as it
fares with those who are suddenly taken with a
killing beautie, or gaze vpon the Sun. Yet some
glimmerings I haue obserued, like an ill-sighted
man, who sees with Spectacles or Perspectiues,
the rather, that your Lordships protection may
haue the same operation on me, the Sunne hath
vpon barren ground, to call out some vsefull
herbe, and by vertue only of your owne influ∣ences.
At Tennis hee that takes not the first ound,
looseth the rest, but in a second or third place,
a man may be the Instrument of good: and I
care not what roome I fill vp, nor what po∣sture
I stand in, so my Company be good and
the action Noble.
This casts me still vpon your Honours good∣nes,
as the Patrone of Vertue, and my safeguard
both from the Ignorance of those who can
find fault at home, and the malice of such as
carpe at any rate, and condemne before the
Book be printed, it may be before 'tis ended: who
antidate their exceptions, and like Merchants
with their goods, enter them, before they ship
them: Such imprest money I doe not like, but
protest against it and the paymaster. Yet, why
should I feare hast or Detraction, when your
Honours fauour is my Pilot.

To beleeue my selfe safe, is to be so: since O∣pinion
strikes a great stroake in the iudgements
and affaires of men, and that it is impossible in
any subiect to find more safety or calmnesse for
this poore Barque, which (I assure your Lord∣ship)
hath endurde many tosses at Sea, and is
now tost on Land to be ploughed vp in long
furrowes, and to beare the brunt of the coldest
and hottest Aire, Summer and Winter cen∣sures.
Which by the iust Temper of your
Lordships good Name, (made surer by that
discending Interest, you being our Chiefe)
shall be thawed and made gentle vnto
mee, who haue nothing more to
boast of then your No∣blenesse
and the
Title of
