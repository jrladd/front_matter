MY LORD,
I Present your Lordship with a small Compendium of many Great and Strange Revoluti∣ons; The Greatest, perhaps, that ever happen'd in England,
 in so short a space of Time. A Tempestuous season, in which some Waves have dasht a∣gainst your Lordship, thô of so eminent a Character for Loy∣alty and Goodness. But when Princes themselves suffer, 'tis the best Subjects Glory to suf∣fer with them. This, My Lord, was no New thing to your Lordship, who was, in a manner, born a Sufferer for Monarchy, and whose Blooming Years had the Ho∣nour to share in the same Exile with your King. 'Tis strange∣ly fatal to consider, that those against whom the disaffected
 Party made of late, the Lowdest outcry, were Old Cavaliers: A Word almost forgotten, had not that Occa∣sion brought it again to Me∣mory. It seems, there needs no more than to read the Facti∣on backwards, and one may see by their false Clamours, who were the Kings best Ministers and Friends. 'Twas the true Honour and Allegiance of that August Assembly in which your Lordship made one of the Better Part, that has Eter∣nized the Fame of Englands Baronage, and made it Glorious and beloved for ever. No
 will Posterity forget a just Ap∣plause to the Illustrious Name of Clarendon, when they read it in the List of those Truly Noble Peers, who in Duty to the Crown and Royal Family, incurr'd the Angry Vote of a numerous, a Violent, and O∣ver-daring Party. Your Lord∣ship being so far, and so honour∣ably, concern'd in the History of these Times, it is my Ambition to take this Occasion to declare my self,
MY LORD,
