MVsitians are not so much praised for their long, as their well Playing; I have endeavou∣red to compose this Peece, a peece of perfect Harmony; and from several Discords, to raise a Con∣cord: The Subject I have undertooke (though a bo∣dy in it self) hath severall dependances like the Tree that gives a being to her many branches. To express much of them in little, may argue some Iudgement: But to assume that to my self, without your generous Approbation, were to conclude me to have, either none at all, or very little. I confess had my Fancy had the Liberty to Feast without confinement, it might have digested it self into some farther illustrations: Nevertheless, I doubt not but you will meet with something in your small Survey, that is, as pleasing

as fitted for the purpose you intended it; All I aimed at, is to deserve your good Opinion, in the content or satisfaction you receive by this; and from thence to derive an Ambition to subscribe my self,
Gentlemen,
