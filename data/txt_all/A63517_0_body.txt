SIR,
THough I am inclined to avoid all that will easily discover me the Author, yet I cannot let my First-fruits pass without an offer∣ing of Thanks to you, by annexing the mention of Your Favours to this Book, which in number and value are so great, as to make my whole self a Debt to you. It is now near Eighteen years since I first knew You, during which time, with∣out any Bond than that of Love You have been not only Fidelity, but Liberality and Bounty to me; obliging me by no less than the free gift of Your entire self to me. Where, or however then I proceed, Your Benesicence must be with me. Moreover, should I have omitted You here, I had failed in the explicating and in the enforcing of Charity: For all that do, or that shall know You, will understand by what they see in You of the nature or offices of Love, and of Inducements thereunto, more than by
what I can write or speak; The Pious and affe∣ctionate provision You have made for some of Your Relatives, (which I hope You will in time make more publick) do evidence Your vigour in Divine and in Human Love: But nothing therein can out-do Your own temper and practice.
I know You like not what I have said, though less I could not say because of Truth. I pray that Your displeasure may cease; for that it is the sincerely intended expression of that in me, which urgeth me towards You beyond what I can express or conceive in Love. God dispose and assist me to improve, as I may and ought, the advantage of having so good and so true a Friend: To whom I shall always express,
Honoured SIR, 
Lond. 23 Septemb. 1680.
