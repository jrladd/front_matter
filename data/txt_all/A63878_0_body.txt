Madam,
I Present your Grace here with a Testimony of my Obedience, and of your own Zeal for the good of Souls. You were in your great Charity, not only pleased to pardon the weakness of this discourse, but to hope it might serve as a memorial to thse that need it, of the great necessity of living vertuously, and by the measures of Christiani∣ty. Madam, you are too Geat and too good to have any ambition for the things of this World; but I cannot but observe that in your designs for the other World, you, by your Charity and Zeal, adopt your self into the portion of those Ec∣clesiasticks, who humbly hope and truly labour for the reward that is promised to those wise persons who convert souls. If our prayers and your desires that every one should be profited in their eternal concerns cast in a Symbol towards

this great work, and will give you a title to that great reward; But, Madam, when I received your commands for dispersing some Copies of this Sermon, I perceived it was too little to be presented to your Eminence; and if it were ac∣companied with something else of the like na∣ture, it might with more profit advance that end which your Grace so piously designed; and therefore I have taken this opportunity to satisfie the desire of some very Honourable and very Reverend Personages, who required that the two following Sermons should also be made fit for the use of those who hop'd to receive profit by them. I humbly lay them all at your Graces Feet, begging of God, that even as many may receive advantages by the perusing of them as either your Grace will desire, or He that preached them did intend. And if your Grace will accept of this first Testimony of my concurrence with all the World that know you, in paying those great re∣gards, which your piety so highly merits, I will endeavour hereafter in some greater instance to pursue the intentions of Your zeal of souls, and by such a service endeavour to do more benefit to others, and by it, as by that which is most accept∣able to your Grace, endear the Obedience and Services, of
Madam,
