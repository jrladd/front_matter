SIR,
THO' a Present of Fables to Your Excellency the in∣imitable Author of the COUNTRY MOUSE, and CITY-MOUSE, may at this time seem im∣proper: Yet a Present of Loyalty to
the same Government, which You have been so Studious and successful in the preservation of, cannot but carry its Acceptance with it. That Li∣berty which Your Excellency gave the World so sweet a tst of in Your most incomparable Fable, and which afterwards You was so instrumental in continuing to us, is in part the Sub∣ject of these. And as Aesop at Tun∣bridge, by feign'd and surreptiti∣ous Fables, seems to bewail the change of the late Gevernment, so Aesop at Epsom with real and genuine ryoy∣ceth at the Establishment of this. Sir, Your Excellency's great Example has such a prevailing influence, as to make the meanest Subject solicitous for the Publick Good, and to see that Revo∣lution become the subject of Satyr,
which has giv'n such opportunities for Panegyrick, (and whose Royal Au∣thor has had such immortal Commen∣dations from Your Excellency's the best of Pens) could not but add very much to my Resentments in the follow∣ing Papers. But, Sir, to give no fur∣ther interruption to a Gentleman whose very Leisure is employ'd for the pub∣lick Safety, I shall not encroach upon Your time any further than to beg Your Acceptance of this poor Entertain∣ment, which shall make me add to my Endeavours of approving my self in a more substantial way,
Sir,
