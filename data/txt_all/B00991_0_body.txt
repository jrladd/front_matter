IN this dangerous time of Pesti∣lence, raging in this our Mother City, and places adiacent, it might be sayd, as sometimes it was of Rome, Paucorum vir∣tus cuncta Romae patrauit. Your Worship, right worthy Knight, being one of this paucity, incumbēt on your office in these places, euen alone Moses-like, from the Morning to the Euening, bearing the burthen of the people, in hearing, deciding, ending their con∣trouersies, mayntayning the vertuous, & punishing the malefactors; and like a broad Fig tree, sustay∣ning the weake and little shrubs, making shaddow to the weary, giuing fruite to the hungry, and bearing your selfe strongly against all peruerse & importune winds of contradictions and discouragements, yea, sowing vertue, and reaping fame; with griefe haue seene, and well doe know, that it might be sayd yet agayne (notwithstanding Gods reuealed wrath and sharpe punishments) as sometimes it was of Rome:
Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.
Chrisostome. fayeth, If thou seest a tree doeth beare no fruit, the cause is in the root. The cause of the barren leaues of the peoples trees, and their vayne words, and abominable workes, I take it to be want of Religion, and Neutrality in Religion: I haue therefore made choyce of this text.
Wherefore I entitle this booke, A Nicke for Neu∣ters, because this our age hath brought forth many a prodigious Polypus, and vayne ayre-full Came∣lions. The diuine Angels of our Churches haue bene vilipended, God hath bene offended, and our City grieuously punished.
God auert his future further plagues, & turne his Iustice into mercy, and giue vs grace by repen∣tance to meet with his iudgements. The Lord stirre vp the heart, and blesse with all wisdome, our pru∣dent succeeding Salomon: inspire with his spirit, and giue fit ability & cunning to Bezaleel, & A∣holiab, to promote the worke of the Tabernacle. God rayse vp (especially now) trusty Chusa, prouidēt Ioseph, and iust Samuel, bold Elias, playne Iohn the Baptist, instant Paul, and feeding Peter: and extirpate and explode wicked Achitophel, co∣uetous Iudas, blind Elymas, and paltry Magus, and graunt, that the Fig leaues of authority, paren∣tage, selfe-loue, flattery, dessembling, and fond fan∣cies, may be pulled off from Madam Psacentia &
the noble Lady Verona may shew her liniaments, in vninuested & vnobscured nakednes: so that with circumcised hearts and catechized soules, we may e∣uery one bring the Arke of God into our houses, while we may; that our houses may be blessed, as those houses were where the Arke was: and that this famous City with the Suburbs, and adioyning Pa∣rishes, now after their late sorrowfull sighing of that Hei mihi, quanta de spe decidi, may (as it was sayd of Christ) gustare post fella fauos, to the glory of God, the Church, Common wealth, and our priuate good, And as by good desert induced, it is my bounden duty, I beseech the most Highest, to stretch out his hand of protection, & defend, receiue vnder the couerture of his wings, and preserue your Worship, and your vertuous Lady, with those toward Imps, your two gracious sonnes, & modest courteous daughters: and to send with this my New-yeeres gift (such as I haue to giue) which I commend vnto you, many new yeeres, and continuall new and true ioyes, benedictions and graces temporall, corporall, spirituall, celestiall, and eternall, for his Christes sake, Amen.
