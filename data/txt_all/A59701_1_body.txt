Sir,
THe many Favours that have been put upon mee by your profuse Palme, command at least a manifestation of what gra∣titude I owe to your much merit∣ing selfe: (Sir) I know this Poem, (though concise) yet for the rare∣nesse and solidity of the Subject, will find welcome with you. It
 castigates him, who hath censured all the Wits of the World, (from the Creation to his time.) Scaliger was indeed a man of profound Learning, and admirable Elocution, but (sure) much besides himself, when he jeeres (with his French witt) so grossely, and vituperatively, the Master of all Learning, and Science, Divine HOMER.
Poetarum omnium, & praestantissimum, & Divinissimum,
(according to Plato)
—Cujusque ex ore profuso, Amnemque in tenues ausa & deducere rivos, unius foecundia bonis.— Manil. Astrol. LIB. 2.

From whose large mouth for Verse, all that since live
Drew water, and grew bolder to derive

 Into thinne shallow Rivers his deepe flood,
Richly luxuriant in one mans good.


The Fount of Wit was Homer, Learn∣ings Syre,
And gave the Liberall Arts their living fire,
Apollo stood amaz'd, and did confesse
Himself was equall'd in Maeonides.

Out of him (saith Learned Plu∣tarch) are all Arts deduced, Angelus Politianus, nominates him the true and onely Apollo: His Iliads, and Odysses (saith Eusthatius) for their Ex∣cellency, may be worthyly called the Sunne, and Moon of the Earth: out of the entire affection that I beare to the Name, and Honour of that most Divine and inimitable
 Wit, as also in the vindication of Poesie, so deeply wounded by this Crittick, in detracting from Homers incomparable worth) I have sum∣moned (by Apollos Writts) most of all the ancient Greek, and Latine Po∣ets to a full Session, (as in Parlia∣ment) The manner of their meet∣ing with their various Votes, and Dissolution. Your self, may in∣forme your self, in halfe an houre.
Sir,
