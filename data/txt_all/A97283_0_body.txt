My Lord,
You have done (being directed, and enabled from on high) many noble and good acti∣ons for this City, the Govern∣ment whereof is yet yours. But really (my Lord) the right ho∣norable act was this, your perso∣nal
and frequent visiting Natha∣niel Butler, when he lay a prisoner in Newgate. His soul certainly was precious in your eyes; and this engaged you to send others, and to go your self to see him several times: I verily believe you will see him yet once more; not as a Malefactor in an obscure disparaging Goal, but as an An∣gel of God in the Kingdom of Christ, whither (I am confident) he is gone, and you are going. Before he went, he desired me to give you humble thanks for all the favor he had received from you, or by your means from o∣thers: He was very thankfull to your Lordship, and the rest
of the Honorable Bench, for his Fortnights Reprieval; confessing that Court to be both just, and merciful; Just, in condemning his body to death; and merciful, in sparing his life for some weeks after the Sentence, upon design to save his soul: And truly you may safely conclude, that his soul is safe. And is not such a Con∣clusion a rich Requital of all your Exhortations, Tears, and Prayers?
My Lord, I shall rejoice to see you grow and abound yet more and more in Righteous∣ness, Holiness, and (as the Elect of God) bowels of Mercies:
which will render you like unto, and well liked of by the LORD of Lords. To whom I leave you, and remain
