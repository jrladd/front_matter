Madam,
THe splendor of your re∣nowned Family, and the influence of Celestiall Graces illuminating the moral vertues you inherit, attracts me and my Meteors, as the Sun does Exhalations and Atomes; although many have been observ'd more il∣lustrious to vulgar eyes, and more
stupendious to common capacities gaz'd upon by the gaping Multi∣tude with terror and admiration; yet some of them now totally e∣clipst, others prov'd but Ignes fa∣tui, the greatest and highest like enflamed Comets, elevated on the wings of Ambition, consume them∣selves with their own glory, disco∣ver'd by their Horoscopes through the Perspectives of Reason; De∣monstrated by the Parallaxes of their Spheres, and by Experience found that the most exalted are but Falling Stars, whose corusca∣tions shew their gross extractions, something sublim'd from the faeces of the Earth; whereas I look upon your Honour like a benevolent Planet Culminant, which may be eclipst for some time, and also set, yet will rise again, recover its for∣mer lustre, and dissipate those Me∣teors
that mask the face of little Stars: and thus (Serene Lady) a smile from you (by vertue of your Rays) will calme the most rigid brow, clear the frowns and cloudy aspects of malignant readers, con∣vert the aspersions of palli'd Envy into Pearls, and scatter the misty Exhalations risen from splenitick bodies, to obtenebrate the weaker inspection of others: but if it be judg'd presumption to require so honourable a Protection in de∣fence of so mean a Peece, vouch∣safe me leave to prostrate this at your Honours Feet, whereby your shadow may prove as propitious, and tutelary, as the Laurel whose shade is held a Sanctuary against storms of Thunder and Lightning.
I have compendiously render'd here (most auspicious Lady) the prognostication of Meteors, with
sundry observations plaine and conspicuous as in a Mirrour, in favour of your Sexe, to whom (I hope) 'twill be acceptable, refle∣cting on the providence of Nature, and in imitation of her dictates, providing best for those who are in most danger to be damnified by the assaults and suddain incursions of angry storms; and this her mo∣therly affection not only visible in Sensitive Creatures, but in all Ve∣getables, vailing their bonners to salute the Sun, while their blossoms receive his vivificating beams; and if too hot for their natures, their leaves fan the Air, or their Husks make Ʋmbrelloes against the inflam∣mation of his Rays, and at other times contract them like traverse curtains, whereby to shelter their infant Buds and tender Blooms from being storm'd, or injur'd by
the excesse or fury of the weather: but the nobler Creatures endow'd with the use of Reason (as your Honour with an ample portion for∣tifi'd with knowledge) those are refer'd to search, and argue the cause, or by precursing signs deriv'd from the effects, prefage the e∣vents, as the collections of Expe∣rience. Upon these animadversi∣ons in order to Natures Instincts, I compos'd this treatise, your ten∣der and beautiful Sexe transcend∣ing her pleasant and odoriferous Flowers; and since the better sort are often now expos'd to rude and boysterous storms, by the abortive production of a more blustering uncivil Age, the precepts of Gra∣titude obliged me to dedicate these Observations to your Ho∣nour (as the Noblest in my eye) that the World may witnesse my
sincere and grateful intentions for sheltring me; In testimony whereof it is sign'd by
