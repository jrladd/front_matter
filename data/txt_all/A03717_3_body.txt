SIR,
NOt so much for your particular inclina∣tion towards mee, much bound vnto you for many kind∣nesses, as for the loue which you haue al∣waies borne to Gods glory, Christs Gos∣pell, and all good causes, wherein you may be cha∣ritable, I must mention your name before some
of these Sermons. The copies were wrested out of mine hands in your house through importu∣nity, and, though distraction of my thoughts a∣bout the passages of another businesse, suffered me not fully to peruse them, yet I was conten∣ted, such as they were, to let them goe. For so, perhaps, I may recompense, in some sort, the time which I then lost from my function, while that which was sometimes preached in the eares of a few, shall now preach to the eyes of all. God direct it both wayes to the heart, and the Lord prolong your time with much comfort heere, and crowne it with eternity.
