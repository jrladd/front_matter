SIR, It pleased God by his prouidence to drawe me to preach at Stepney nigh London in Easter tearme 1613. where Sir Antho∣ny Cope beeing one of my auditors, a man to whom I was vnknowne, af∣ter the ending of that businesse sent for me, and entreated that I would enlarge the two last pointes of this tractate, beeing part of my sermon at that time, and to send them vnto him; which at my returne I speedily vnder∣tooke: and hauing added as herein is expres∣sed, I endeauoured two seueral times to haue cōmunicated thē vnto him, but I fayled of my
 purpose, and hee stood disappointed of my la∣bours. Now as I am enformed, he is gone the way of all flesh: a man in his life time well commended for his pietie and zeale, with whom I am not willing to burie that which he for his priuate comfort desired, but to com∣mend it to the Church, leauing the blessing of it to him that is the God of all grace and fa∣ther of all mercies. And for that it hath plea∣sed God of his great mercie to make me both scholler and fellow of your Colledge, where through the Lords goodnesse I obtained that small portion of learning I haue: And in as∣much as since that time I haue found you ve∣ry kind and willing to yeeld such fauours vnto me in preferring such as I desired, I haue al∣waies, and now must ingeniously confesse, that I stand in these respects greatly obliged vnto you; and not hauing wherewith to make any recompence for so great benefit, I haue pre∣sumed to offer vnto your iudicious view this poore Tractate, and to publish it vnder your protection, as a testimonie of my thankefull heart; humbly praying you to accept these my first fruites with that affection with which I commend them. And thus commending you to him that is able to keepe you that you fall not, and to present you faultlesse before the
 presence of his glorie with ioy, I humbly take my leaue.
Kings-Lynne in Norfolke: Sep∣temb. 29. 1615.
