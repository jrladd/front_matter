MOst Honorificicabilitudinitatibus, I hauing studied
the seuen Lubberly Sciences (being nine by computa∣tion)
out of which I gathered three coniunctions foure
mile Asse-vnder, which with much labour, and great
ease, to little or no purpose, I haue noddicated to your
gray, graue, and grauelled Prate ction. I doubt not
but I might haue had a Patron neerer hand, as the Deane of Dunsta∣ble,
or the Beadle of Layton Buzzard, but that I know the Phrase,
Methode and Stile, is not for euery mans vnderstanding, no my
most renowned Pythagor-Asses, for you this Hogshead of inuention
was brewed and broched, for I am ignorantly perswaded, that your wise∣dome
can picke as much matter out of this Booke in one day, as both the
Vniuersities can in twelue moneths, and thirteene Moones, with six times
foure yeeres to boot. I know your bounties too exding, for as old mother
Baly said, the wit of man was much, when she saw a dog muzzled. E∣uery
man is not borne to make a Monument for the Cuckoo; to send a
Trifoote home alone, to driue sheepe before they haue them, or to Trundle
cheeses downe a hill. So saluting you with more prespect then the Mayor
of Loo did the Queenes Ape, I take leaue to leaue you, and rest yours to
bid you welcome, if you came within a mile of my house to stay all night.
