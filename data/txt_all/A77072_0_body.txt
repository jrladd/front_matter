My Lord,
I Have always since I saw your person, accoun∣ted my selfe exceedingly below your taking notice of me, & should now have thought it as great presumption, to prefix your name to any thing of mine, especially such a thing as this, had I not in a sort been compeld thereto, and that not out of any respect to my self, as having learned, being of a long time accustomed to suffer reproch: but because I have bin so frequently an eare, and now in Master Edwards book, an eye witnesse, what is in the dark, and as it were at a distance, whisper'd, by them that now dare not, as hereto∣fore, draw too nigh, as having once or twice experience, that their disapointment in offering personall injuries, hath not only been an addition of honour to you, (which as the Sun appears brighter after a cloud,) but have made themselves publike examples, as well of ignorance, as en∣vy, and given men to see them such as were foretold should be in the the last times, even such as
Revel. 22.23.  love and fashion a lye for advantage, therefore now like the Ser∣pent (that wounds the womans seed in the heel, because he can do no further mischief,) they remotely, seek, but
in vain, to blemish your honour for entertaining me, who in this turn of time, like a vessell of small quantity, have had some dependance on you, whom God as the glory of your fathers house, for the safety and honour of this Na∣tion, hath made to many, besides, like Eliakim, a Nail, fastned in a sure place: and thus they direct their arrows, even bitter words: I am charg'd afresh with errour, though solemnly discharged, where I was first accused, And this hinted, as patroniz'd by you, in entertaining me, But the whole Kingdome knows, and all the World may, That Errours of all sorts, whether Politicall, Do∣ctrinall, or Ecclesiasticall, have been eminently, accor∣ding to the emenency of your honour, and deep under∣standing, as heretofore, so to this present houre, mightily and successfully, to the Kingdoms joy, withstood by you. Wherefore, the humble request I make to your Honour is, that as opportunity may be given, both by your selfe, and others, by your advice, enquiry may be made, whi∣ther these things be so or no, that God may be magnified, the truth justified, errour silenced, your honour in that act of entertaining me, preserved, my self alone ashamed, if any such thing be proved against him, that is willing to offer himself to the triall of all, that love our Lord Je∣sus, and that the rather, because I have bin awhile, more perticularly:
