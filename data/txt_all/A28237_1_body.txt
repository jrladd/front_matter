Most Royal Sir,
THese Commentaries, containing the Acts of three Princes, began about some ten years since, un∣der the Protection of Your most August Father to breathe the common air; and but for so Gracious an Aspect, had suffered even at the instant of their Birth. For the errours of the Press had made them such, as might have deterred even ex∣treme Impudence from so presumptive a Dedication. Yet such as they were, they found Acceptance and Favour at His Royal Hands. Hence am I encouraged to conse∣crate this second (but corrected) Edition to

Your Majesty, Who inherit as well Your Father's Virtues, as his Kingdoms. Neither indeed can it befit any other after KING JAMES of ever Sacred Memory. Most humbly therefore beseecheth Your Majesty to daign it the like Gracious Acceptance, who with the same Loyalty and Observance dedi∣cateth and consecrateth to Your Majesty himself and his,
