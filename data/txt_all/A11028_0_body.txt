RIght Honorable, and right Worship∣full:
Next vnto the sacred Scriptures of
almightie God, wherein is contained
the only ground of our faith, beleefe, &
saluation in Christ Iesu, the knowledge
of other Histories, are not of small im∣portance
to be weighed, and in some measure digested of
all men, for diuers causes if they be duely considered and
examined: but most of all and especially with more re∣gard
and iudgement of such as your Honour and Wor∣ships
are, who for many considerate causes and other ver∣tues,
are called to the administring of iustice in the pub∣like
weale: I except vaine fabulous inuentions, & meane
those philosophicall workes, which either are morall, or
historicall, tending to vertue, or suppressing vice. Among
all which worthie volumes, as the numbers be many, and

subiects sundrie, the histories of the ancient Romanes go∣uernment
is not of least esteeme to be preferred with the
chiefest: considering how from their meane originall &
base beginning, they acquised and got the soueraigntie
of the whole world. This briefe translation (right Ho∣norable
and right Worshipfull) written in French, de∣scribeth
the principall warres and Conquests of the Ro∣manes,
whose acts and gests, (concerning the gouernmēt
of their Common-wealth, with other matters in the large
volumes conteined) are not (I know) vnknowne to your
Honour and Worships, and a great number moe (by
knowledge of which, is reaped no small profit:) but the
multitude, or vulgar sort of our nation, not hauing those
large volumes, neither can attaine vnto for value of price,
or want of knowledge of the languages wherein some
of them are written, may in this briefe behold how those
great Monarches in their sayd warres, stirred vp by Am∣bition
of rule and Emperie, subdued the Nations of the
world, onely first, by flinging into the principalities of
peaceable Princes, the fire of ciuil discord, strife, and dis∣cension:
by meanes whereof when they had gotten that
footing, then shortly after followed the ruine, decay, and
vtter ouerthrowe of those Countries, and Kingdomes,
their cities and people: and how when their Empire was
at highest, through those furies kindled with hate and
reuenge among themselues, their great gouernment fel to
ruine and decay, (a thing most wonderfull in the iudge∣ment
of God) so that at this day of their great Conquests,
there is no more mention left thereof, saue only the bare
name of Caesar: whose declining estate (God sparing me
life) I meane to bring into as small a roome and com∣passe,

as this, which sheweth their increasing fame of
worldly glorie.
My humble desire is, that this my poore vnpolished la∣bour
may finde that fauour of your Honour and Wor∣ships
to be accepted, and taken in good part, vnder your
worthie protections, the rather in that they who are here
mentioned, were Citizens and gouernours of a most re∣nowmed
Citie like this, wherein you are Magistrates, &
gouernment thereof, for your virtues, cōmitted vnto you,
whose minds whilest they liued, the world could not cō∣taine,
do before your Honor & Worships in a few paper
leaues muster themselues and their greatnes, to the ende
that their great Conquests vnder your patronages, may
first passe through this noble Citie, and after through the
cities, townes and villages of her Maiesties dominions, to
all her other faithful & true harted subiects, by reading of
which they may consider in these thundring dayes, the
great threatnings of our mightie & mortal foe, the insati∣able
Monarch, whom the worlds Empire wil not suffice,
Caesar like with his adherents, seeking daily by many craf∣tie
conueiances, treasons, treacheries, & other inhumane
and vnchristianlike meanes, to kindle the fire of strife &
ciuill discention among vs, the easier to preuaile, to the
vtter ruine, and ouerthrowe, both of Prince, people and
countrie, which God of his good grace, hath most migh∣tilie
and miraculously defended a long time: let all true
English hearts pray, that it will please him so to continue
his gracious fauour euermore towards vs.
What vnitie, loue, concord, and peace is, (Gods name
bee blessed) wee may all say wee haue felt, doe feele and
know, and whilest the bands of them true and firmely la∣steth,

we shall be inuincible: but if once they begin to dis∣solue,
by perusing of this brief historie, may be seene how
many miseries follow.
God preserue your Honour and Worships, and that it
will please him to direct your hearts in all your actions,
to increase in you vertue, which liueth when all worldly
vanitie els dieth, and send you long liues, to be most wor∣thie
members, for the aduancement of this most noble
flourishing Common-wealth and Monarchie, which
God of his gracious goodnes grant long to continue, vn∣der
the gouernment of the thrice happie and prosperous
raigne of the admirable Empresse of the world, our
most gracious Soueraigne Ladie Queene Eli∣zabeth,
ouer whom be the power of
his mightie hand euermore
extended. Amen.
