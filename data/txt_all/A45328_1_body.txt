Worthy SIR:
I have emboldened my self to offer
that unto the World, under Your
Patronage, which, I believe, Your
singular Modesty will almost decline,
and fear, Your excellent Ingenuity will
be ready to disown, when you finde
it so unworthy of the benigne influences

of your Eyes, much more of the Efflu∣ences
of your Name, Virtue, and
Authority, by which You are able to
Patronize any thing that makes You
its Sanctuary of Refuge. Neither Sir,
have Principles of Policy onely per∣swaded
me to inscribe Your famous
Name, and entitle Your Worthy
Self to this my imperfection: but indeed,
a desire to Express and Testifie the
Esteem I have of the One, and the Love and Honour which I deservedly
have for the Other. If any man, in this
nice Age, may be judged worthy to be
the Object of a Dedication, it must be
a Theophilus; and, if any other, I do
verily believe, you are a Theophilus;
if a sober, moderate, Contemplative,
serious life, adorned with many publick
and private Exercises of Religion, Ex∣pressions
of a Gracious Soul; if constant

and vigorous Endeavours to reconcile
Differences amicably, and suppress Sin
Authoritatively; if an engaging, edi∣fying,
aweing presence, to Wife,
Children, servants; if a sweet, friendly,
charitable owning of Gods People; or
a cordial, gladsome Entertainment of his
faithfull Ministers; if any of these, if all
these will denominate a man a Lover of
God, Accept, I pray you, Sir, ths poor
Oblation; and although I do not, can∣not
judg this little Impolite Treatise
worthy your Countenance or Patro∣nage,
yet I beseech you, for the love of
God, to stir up all your whole Soul 
improve your utmost interest to main∣tain
and defend the Cause which there∣in
I study to Patronize, which is not yet
so much my Cause, as the Cause of
all the Faithfull Ministers of Christ,
and not so much theirs neither, as

Christs. Go on  beseech You, and,
whatever Troubles shall be upon the
earth, whatever Divisions, Distractions,
Dissettlements, Apostasies are, or may
be in England, yet study to approve
Your Self to be a Friend to God's
Cause, whom you love; and Faithfull
to the Interest of Jesus Christ, in whom
you believe. And so doing, that You
may be bless'd with dayes as prosperous
as many, with a Crown as Glorious
as Eternall, is, and shall be the hearty
Prayer of
Sir,
 Long-Whatton.
