Great Sir,
I Here present you with the sad portrai∣ture of the wasted and distressed Church and Kingdome of England, which as it is both the subject and partner of your Fa∣thers
sorrowes, so it is now become the object and mat∣ter for your Honourable Actions. Many great and glorious spirits have lost their splendour for want of worke, and many o∣thers have failed of true excellency by misemploy∣ment, whilst the greatnesse of their achievements and victories have been blemi∣shed with injustice and im∣piety, and for want of a right ground of their en∣terprises, their conquests
over the rights of other men have been but splendi∣da peccata, magna latroci∣nia. God hath provided bet∣ter worke for you to do; Iu∣stice and Honour lye equal∣ly before you, and offer you a large sphaere for so bright a Planet to move in; Since your businesse is not to op∣presse, but to deliver your oppressed Father, and his people; not to invade other mens rights, but to reco∣ver your owne: That you may be the Inheritour at
once of the valour of your Grandfather, the Great Henry of France; and of the Iustice and Piety of your Father, the Great Charles of England. Of which two, whether was more glo∣rious, the former in the prowesse of his doings, or the latter in the constancy and patience of his suf∣ferings, may be the great controversie of Ages to come. Both these toge∣ther are a paire of gol∣den Spurres presented unto
your Highnesse to set you forward unto high under∣takings; that you may give the Crowne unto the Sto∣ries of your Ancestours; let the foundation of your enterprises be Religion, and then you may expect that the great God will finish them with a golden roofe of successe, which is the hearty prayer of him
Who is a most humble and faithfull Subject of your Fathers, and ho∣norour of your High∣nesse.
