My Lord,
THE extraordi∣nary Obligati∣ons this King∣dom

has to Your Lordship, having filled all Places with Admiration and Ac∣knowledgment of Your Pru∣dent Conduct and Mini∣stry, I could no longer curb my Zeal, from ad∣ding one Voice to the U∣niversal Acclamations, nor hinder it from crowding with this Offering to Your Feet. It is, My Lord, the Life of a Prince, whose Carier, in some things, lay parallel with Your

Lordships. For he was of a most Illustrious Ex∣traction, Graceful in Per∣son, and of Abilities fit both to Advise and Execute in the most ticklish Jun∣ctures; yet in this he dif∣fered; that he was a Pro∣moter of the Interests of the Court, and Superstiti∣ons of the Church of Rome, and Your Lord∣ship a Zealous Maintainer of the Prerogatives of the Crown, and Devotions of

the Church of England. For, to You, My Lord, we are principally indebted for our present Calm; by Your Ministry those Allarms are dissipated, that kept us continually in Apprehen∣sions, the Subjects satisfi∣ed of the Security of their Religion and Properties, and the Sovereign of the Fidelity, and Loyalty of His Subjects. Insomuch that it is no wonder if we all strive to Celebrate so extra∣ordinary

a Patriot, and that I have presumed to make a Publick Declara∣tion of the Respect and Zeal with which I am,
My Lord,
