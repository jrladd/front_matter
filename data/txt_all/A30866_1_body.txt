SIRS,
THE Favours that I have received from Your Excellency since Your Ac∣cession to this Government, and from You the Honourable Members of His Majesty's Council here, as also from You the Worthy and Wor∣shipful Representatives of the People in our General Assembly, and from the Inhabitants of this Island in general, have been so many and Eminent, that I cannot but be truly sensible they exceed all possibility of a just Compensation. Nor do I presume that the Compilement of this Tract of the LAWS (now in all hu∣mility dedicated to Your Excellency, Council and General Assembly) ought in any measure to be esteemed worthy to be taken as any part of a Retribution. Nor did I attempt this Work upon any such Motive, but purely that I was convinced that every Man is a Debtor to his Country and Profession; and therefore could not but think my self obliged in Duty to exert my utmost Efforts in some Service for the good of this Island, as lay most proper for my Post and Profession, of which I con∣jectured, that a Collection of the LAWS would be most acceptable, especially considering the numerous Disadvantages daily suffered for want of it.
But as the many Attempts formerly without Effects made towards such a Col∣lection, convincingly shewed the difficulty of the Task, so it did as manifestly de∣clare the general Benefit that was aimed at, and expected from such a Performance, and thereby confirmed me in my former Opinion, and incouraged me to offer some In∣timations of such my Purposes and Designations to the Assembly; which found such an Acceptation, as easily convinced me that I could not better acquit my self of my Duty, than by a Tender of my Endeavours in that Service, whose good Opinion of my poor Abilities, and obliging Commands chiefly induced me to this Undertaking.
Though I am sufficiently conscious I am not par Operi, yet hope this well intended Enterprize will give Life and Encouragement to some Abler Person to give it a fi∣nishing Stroak, and bring it to Perfection for the Benefit of this Place and Island, that hath produced and raised many great Estates to several Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither; and also considerable and great Revenues to His Sacred Ma∣jesty, and which on a calm Enquiry into, and serious Consideration of the Customs it payeth for its own Native Commodities Exported hence, the increase of English Trade and Navigation it causeth, the Seamen it thereby breedeth, the Consumption of Goods of English Growth it maketh, will not be found less advantageous to the Crown of England than the best of His Majesty's American Colonies. This may be a sufficient Reason to hope, that since His Gracious Majesty hath been pleased to grant the Power of making LAWS proper for the Constitution of this Island, consonant and agreeable (as near as may be) to the LAWS of his Kingdom of England; That He will also from Your Excellency's Recommendation, extend His wonted Especial Grace and Favour to Us in the passing the Act for the Printing and Establishing of this Collection, which being intended for the Press, hath re∣ceived a strict and full Examination (that it might be Correct) on the Oath as well of the Clerk of the Council from the Records there, and the Clerk of the As∣sembly from the Records of that House; and also of a Committee of the General Assembly, with the Inspection and Approbation of the Honourable Francis Bond, late President, and Honourable the Members of His Majesty's Council here, with the Attorney and Sollicitor General, and now an Authority for its Impression, by Your Excellency's passing the Bill for that purpose.
This once Flourishing (but alas! now Withering) Isle, being blest with Your Excellency's Auspicious Presence, cannot but with all Duty and Loyalty rejoyce in His Majesty's great Goodness to, and abundant Care of her, in his Election and Mission of a Person of Your Birth, Honour and Dignity to Govern her,

whose chief Delight consists in an equal distribution of Justice, and a lively and im∣partial Execution of His Majesty's LAWS, and must eternally be obliged with the utmost Gratitude, to acknowledge the Blessing she hath already received from Your Indulgence and Care. You have already opened the long barr'd Gates of her Rights and Priviledges, restor'd her Ancient Charter, and given a new Life to her Laws. You have prescribed and reconciled our late Animosities and Discords, and happily setled Love and Union throughout Your Government, which seems Paternal, and Our Obedience to Your Excellency, bottomed rightly on Love, not (according to the Dreams and Conceits of the Hobbists) upon Fear. So that I cannot omit doing Your Ex∣cellency that Justice, as to declare, You have imitated the most eminent and greatest Examples, viz. Our Illustrious Edward, and Glorious Elizabeth, as well as the Learned and Great Justinian; and therefore may justly be said to be the Life of our Laws, as well as a Pattern of Vertue and Honour. Nor is Your Excellency's high Care and Regard to the Royal Prerogative less observable, by which means You may de Jure claim (because you merit) the Dignity and Authority His Ma∣jesty hath with so much Wisdom and Judgment conferred on You.
'Tis not any Thoughts I have of my own Performance, that tempted me to the Ar∣rogance of prefixing Your Excellency's Name, together with those of the Honou∣rable Council, and General Assembly, to this Treatise, but the Nature and Dig∣nity of the Subject Matter. For who should more rightfully Patronize the LAWS, than those that gave them Being and Birth, and who preserve them by an equal and warm Execution?
How excellently fitted and adapted these LAWS are to the good Government of this Place, the many Years we have lived quietly, happily and securely under their Directions and Injunctions, will give a most convincing Testimony, and irrefragable Argument, so as they may not improperly be called as well the Walls of the Colony as of Justice.
LAWS are described by Cicero, de Legibus, to be the highest or chiefest Rea∣son grafted in Nature, commanding the things that are to be done, and forbidding the contrary: And Fortescue speaking of the Statute Laws, gives them this En∣comiastick Definition, Lex est Sanctio Sancta, jubens honesta, & prohibens contraria; they are truly the universal Suffrages of Nature propagating Good, and impeading Evil. Without such, Virtue would be without Reward, and Vice without Punishment. LAW is as the Soul in Government, that giveth it Life and Form, and is certainly the best Guard, as well of the King's Prerogative, as of the Peoples Darlings, Liberty and Property.
The greatest Strength of Kingdoms, consists in the goodness of their LAWS, they being the Nerves of the Body Politick, and are both Rules and Curbs to the Ministers of Justice, to direct and keep them in the Paths of Honour and Righ∣teousness, and prevent all Arbitrariness in them, (whose Province it should be to distribute Right, equally to Rich and Poor) and their Officers. Infinite are the Bene∣fits which accrew to those that are Partakers of Good Laws; by which, Omne hu∣manum Bonum, our Lives and Fortunes are preserved from Oppression and Abso∣lute Power, our Possessions secured to Posterity, and we in this delightful Island made safe and happy.
King Edgar collected the Laws of his Kingdom, and gave them the Strength of a Faggot bound, when as before his time they were loose and dispersed. This gave him more Glory than the Sayling round his Island with a potent Fleet rowed by con∣quered Kings; and was the greatest Action of him or his Predecessors for the Good of his Subjects, the Benefit whereof hath even reached this Age, and encouraged us to follow his glorious Example, by gathering together, and methodizing the loose and scatter'd Laws into one Body, which is done in this Collection, the advantage of which, will (I doubt not) be largely experienced in a short time by all the Inhabi∣tants,

and may be of signal Use to all Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither, particularly to the Professors and Practisers of the Law in England, who have for∣merly wanted them as Directions in Cases upon which their Judgments have been re∣quired.
And as our Laws are to be valued and preserved as our chiefest Jewel, so in the framing them, the greatest Care, Prudence and Consideration ought to be had, that they be grounded on true and loyal Principles, always respecting and promoting what is right and just. No private Interest but the Common Good, should be the end and motive of their Constitution; they should also have the duos Sales the Lord Cook mentions as their necessary Ingredients, viz. Salem Sapientiae, ne sint insipidae, & Salem Conscientiae, ne sint Diabolicae. They should also increase rather in Goodness than in Number, which naturally produceth Amazement and Confusion, if not Dis∣cord. For the Government wherein an unanimous Accordance happens, is like a well furnished Quire, where all the Actions, Words and Various Sounds, yield and main∣tain a glorious Harmony.
Thus it is evident how great the Benefits are which we receive constantly by good Laws; and thus it is also evident, that the want of such Laws, or a lively Exe∣cution of them, is inconsistent with the true Interest of Mankind, Men without Go∣vernment being worse than Beasts, as having greater means by the advantage of their depraved Reason to do more (yea and more) superlative Mischiefs, when let loose to the Dictates of their Will, such as Rebellion, Murther, Rapines, &c.
But as the Miseries and Misfortunes are innumerable, which attend a People that have no Laws, so the Unhappiness of those who have good Ones is not much less, if they be kept from publick View and general Use; for in such Case, what shall direct them to their several Duties? what encourage Obedience, what affright them from Obliquities and Transgressions? To obviate and remove all which Evils and Inconve∣niences, is the prime End and Design of the Publication of this Tract.
I fear I have too much trespassed on Your Patience, and by this long Harrangue, rudely invaded those Minutes which You know how much better to dispose of, there∣fore will detain You no longer, but to submit this Piece (such as it is) to Your Ex∣cellency's, and the Honourable and Worshipful Gentlemens Patronage, with a Duty and Devotion becoming
SIRS,
