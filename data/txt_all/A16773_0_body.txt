THe countenance of a Land∣lord,
makes a poore Tenant
halfe a King, and simple
men are no fooles, that fol∣lowe
the shadow of alittle honour: for my
selfe, I am of none of these Sects: for I e∣steeme
more of the kindenes of a good spi∣rite,
than of faire wordes, that bewitch
Ignorance; yet I reuerence Honour, and
loue Vertue, but finding my selfe vnwor∣thy
the fauour of great ones, and yet not
willing to looke among the too little, I will
loue where I find cause, & deserue where
I finde loue: in which sence, entreating
you, in the fore rancke of my affection, to

march with your kind friend M. Con∣quest:
I commend to the good leizure of
of your patience, the perusing of this little
pamphlet, deuided into three pees: a
Passe, a Precession, and a Prognosti∣cation:
Pasquill gaue them to me, to de∣liuer
vnto you, which with his further
seruice shall be further at your comman∣dement:
and for my selfe how well I loue
you I will not tell you, til your commande∣ment
make me happy in your emploiment,
& so wishing both in the work, & my wil,
a more worthines of your kindnes, I rest:
