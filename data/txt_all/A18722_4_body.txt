MY good and affectionate Worshipfull friend for manie curtesies I promised to dedicat some verses vnto you, and finding no subiect better to write v∣pon then the maintenance of Hos∣pitalitie, I thought a little to touche the losse of time, and charges that a number of Gentlemen spendeth at London, not anie whit thereby blemishing the good bruite of that hono∣rable Cittie (so I praie you vnderstand me) but shewing the inconuenience that commeth by ouer great charges bestowed and spent where nothing is gathered againe,

nor reaped at the last but repentance, or such colde ac∣quaintance, as when money is gone will scarse knowe a man in time of necessity, this being spoken generally of all the places and Citties in the worlde, where men shall finde but strangenes, when their owne wealth and e∣state begins to decline.
