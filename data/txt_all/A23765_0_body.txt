Madam,
SEeing it is the heart which God a∣lone accepts, as a Sacrifice of re∣tribution, I humbly crave you would be pleased to take a view of the coun∣terpart of my Soul, wherein is set down the joyful correspondency it has had with Heaven; and the rather because joy and immortality, our en∣trance into the Blessed Mansions a∣bove, is the common interest and de∣sign of all who appeal to Heaven in the name of Christ: I know your Clo∣set is plentifully stor'd with holy Eja∣culations, that Sacred perfume which sweetens the very breath of the Soul, and is more acceptable to God, than costly odours, the scent of Myrrh and Frankincense, yet these Papers pos∣sibly may find entertainment; because

they are pen'd by one whose Soul has been many years travelling that way, and therefore chiefly endeavours to speak the dialect & Language of that Kingdom: no friendship is so strong as that which is contracted by Travel∣lers in this journey; and though I have the honour to have the same blood of R. A's. running in my veins, yet I esteem my self more happy in the be∣ginnings of our Christian allyance and eternal duration of it, when we shall pass from this state of grace to that of glory. How glorious must your entrance be into the Holy Land; for Persons placed in so high a station by holy example command their atten∣dants: & when you enter into the land of promise, your numerous train must follow; in which retinue to be ad∣mitted is the humble and hearty Prayer of
Madam,
