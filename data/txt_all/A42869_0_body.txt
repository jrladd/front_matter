SIR,
IT will be my sufficient Apology for the pub∣lishing
of this Sermon, to all those that
know in what Tyes of duty I stand
bound to you, that you commanded me,
first to Preach it, and then to Print it.
A Command by no means, without the
deepest stain of ingratitude, to be disobeyed by me; were
it but onely to take this opportunity of declaring to the
world, That there is no man upon earth, to whom I stand
so particularly oblieged (not at all to disparage the cur∣tesies
of other Friends) for many great and extraordinary
Favours, as to your self. You have been pleased not onely
to make choice of me for your Minister, and freely to pre∣sent
me with a Living, but to give me many other encou∣ragements,
not usual for Patrons to bestow upon their
Clerks. And indeed, should you not be a Noble Patron,
it would be a greater Wonder, then to see many others
Ignoble and Base; since (I cannot but think) this Ver∣tue
is descended down to you by Inheritance, together
with your Estate, and you must needs degenerate from
your Ancestors, should you be otherwise; Particularly your
excellent Grandfather, Sir Thomas Freke, whose Name
is still like a Precious Oyntment, and whom I the rather
mention (with Honour to his Memory) because among
many other works of Piety and Charity that he abounded

in, he did at his own Charge raise the Structure of this
Church (of which I am through your Bounty a Minister)
from the Foundation. By whose Munificence, as we have
now a Decent and Comely Place to serve God in; so he
himself hath built his own Monument, Aere perennius,
which will keep his Name alive for many Generations, af∣ter
his Body is consumed, and his Bones are rotten. You
carry both his Names, which cannot but frequently mind
you of his Vertues, and incite you to write after so fair a
Copy. To expatiate in your personall Commendations is
not the Business of this Epistle: since I know your Dispo∣sition
to be as farre from vain-glory, (as I can truly say)
mine is from Flattery; and to Praise you, would be the
ready way to displease you. Indeed that is the most Chast
and Immaculate goodness, which doth good, and desires
not to be taken Notice of.
Sir, I beseech you to accept of this slender Testimony of
my Thankfulness, the following Sermon; which passing
under the Protection of your Name, will (I hope) meet
with the kinder entertainment from all that know You.
And together with this, my heartiest Prayers, That God
would be pleased to enrich your soul with all Spiritual and
Heavenly Blessings in Christ Jesus, proportionable to that
large Measure of outward and Temporal Blessings, which
he hath bestowed upon you, that so you may be happy here,
and happy hereafter; which is and shall be the daily
Prayer of
Honoured Sir,
