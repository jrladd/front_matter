SIth God and King,Hee is tru∣ly liberal aud mag∣uanimous vvhich de∣lights more in good re∣novvne the money. Se∣neca. and your mindes sympathie
Haue made you Two, an vndeuided One,
(One, as of two loue makes an Vnity,)
I cannot giue a Guift to one alone:
For (will I, nill I) if to one I send
A token of my loue, or loues desire,
That sending to the other must extend,
Sith lou doth make your Vnion so intire!
Your Soueraigne (that with Iudgments Sharpest Eye
Transpearceth all that is oppos'd to it)
Saw ye were made for Ioue of Maiestie,That boun∣ty and be∣neficence that stands in trauaile & diliḡ is both mrehones and also spreades further, & is able to profit mor Cicero.
Sith carelesse yee were of more* benefit.
O they are worthie to be Minions
To God, and King that loue but for their loue:
Who, to them both, and their dominions,
Yeeld fruites of sweete. Affects for bothes behoue.
No Sunne ere saw two Faurites of a King
(For, for the most part, such hurt Great, and small)
More deere to al, for the Place mannaging,
Then your (deere Paire) prest to do good to all!
In loue contending who, for Vertues sake,
(O blessed Strife excelling Vnitie!)
Shall do most good, & most*men bounden make
To you, to whom the World it selfe would tye:
Hold on rare Spirites;As the touch sto trieth gold so gold tr∣eth men. Plato. this emulation
Is such-as, with fine force, your fames aduance
Beyond the compasse of Confusion,
And reach of Enuy, Sclander, and Mischance.
O stríue you stíll to show the World yee scorne
To turne such publicke grace to priuate* game:He is a vi∣cious pers saith S. Agustine. that atten deth only his ovvne profit.
(As if you were for your * selues onely borne)
Sith all, but Vertue, is as vile as vayne:
And if I liue, you, liuing thus, I may
Legend your liues in Liues that scorne decay:
And, Skill shall faile me but Ile place yee neere
Cestor, and Pollux in the Heau'nly Spheare.
