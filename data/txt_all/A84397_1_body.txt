EVen as, my brethren and fellow-soldiers, our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God the Father, by the determinate will of God, being before the foundations of the world were laid, in fulness of time left the bosome of his heaven∣ly Father, and took our nature upon him, to be born into this miser∣able world, and here to live a poor, wretched, and miserable life, to the end that he might be crucified for the redemption of mankind, to sa∣tisfie his heavenly Fathers Divine Justice and wrath for the sins of the miserable lost sons of our parents Adam and Eve, and to con∣quer death, sin, and hell, by his death and passion; by means where∣of, and faith in him, we be not only freed from the curse of God due to sinners, but also delivered out of the bondage of Satan, that old enemy of mankind: So you likewise, dearly beloved friends, not only have freed my self, but the three Nations, by Gods provi∣dence, your noble General and your good endeavors, with the ha∣zarding
 of your blood, lives and fortunes, from the bondage of tyrannical Kings the restoring of my self and the English Common∣wealth to their prestine freedoms and priviledges of true English men, and delivering of us from the bonage of the Norman yoak; so that now we be a free people indeed, neither is there any Nation in the world like unto the English Nation, who be both Christians, and a wise and ingenious people; wherefore I have writ this Meta∣phorical and Hieroglyphical ship, in thankfulness unto you, dedica∣ted unto the noble General in the first place to your selves in the next, and to every free-born English man, who desires to serve the Lord of Hosts in spirit and truth, and King Jesus your heavenly Captaine General, who hath owned you and your noble General in the day of battel, and given unto you so many notable victories over your and the Commonwealths enemies, To teach and instruct you how to keep these victories the living God hath given to you, by fetching of justice and mercy into this Nation again, and establishing them here for the age of Methusalah; and do advise you speedily to pe∣tition his Excellency for that purpose hereafter remonstrated, which will free you from the plague and other imminent dangers, which the Solar Eclipse this March doth threaten this Nation withall, but especially mankinde; (for I fear many of you will not live to enjoy the fruits of your labors) and that you be sure to learn to do unto every man as you would be done unto. And if you do, I who have vowed to eat no bread for six moneths for your sakes, shall be en∣abled to perform my promise unto you, and to cloath you all in scarlet, and gaine all your ariears, according to my ingagement: and in case you do not, nevertheless I have out of a good conscience done my duty to God Almighty, and to you; and so I rest
Given from my quarters this 7 day of March 1651 and in the sixteenth week of my abstinence from food for your sakes, and the glory of Gods mercy in Christ.
