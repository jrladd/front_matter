Dread Soveraigne:
WHither should Faith have its refuge, but to Faiths Defender? If Apostates dare abuse authority then surely truth may take sanctuary under your sacred protection. There are a frie of Locusts (in these licen∣tious times) smarmd out of the bottom∣lesse pit, which have almost consumed our Vine. And while we have gone about to drive out one Antichrist, a worse is come in his roome. Help therefore, O King, to drive out these Caterpillars. Let not
those which deny authority usurpe autho∣rity. Your humble Subject takes God to witnesse that he aimes not at the godly or truely religious, but onely at such, as whose consciences accusing them may have time and leasure enough to repent, and amend. The Lord turne them, and preserve and keepe your Majesty from all danger for ever, Amen.
