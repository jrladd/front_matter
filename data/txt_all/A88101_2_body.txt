Reverend Sir,
YOur Consolatory Letters I cannot sufficiently bless God and You for, and therefore do again return my most humble and hearty thanks for your very great la∣bour of love therein expressed, withal earnestly craving leave to make them publick; the doing whereof, will (I am assured) redound much to the glory of God, erecting many souls dejected for the like loss, and furtherance of your own glorious reward in the great day of account and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord.

Sir, there is another trouble fallen upon my spirit, wherewith I take the boldness to acquaint you; occasioned by an Examination of some of my Ar∣guments for the truth of our Parochial Churches by my Antagonist John On∣ley, which hath been abroad (as I hear) a long time, but lately came to my no∣tice by a Minister 20. miles distant. I find the Book so full of bitterness and arrogancy, that I question whether it be better to let the man alone, or to answer him according to his folly: I have sent it to you, requesting your perusal there∣of, and your advice what I shall doe (with all convenient speed) which shall lay a further Obligation upon.
Sir,


To which Letter of Dr. Brian, a short and summary answer is returned in the next leaf; a full one in the whole dis∣course following.
