MOst exorbitant Paunchmon∣ger, I hauing taken much vn∣necessary paines in writing these fewe collections of your deseruing Acts, in memory thereof haue erected this Monument of incke and paper. Herostratus was famous for bur∣ning the Temple of Diana in Ephesus: De∣dalus for flying in the Ayre, and Leander for swimming ouer the Hellespontick sea: So by this small Treatise of your vertues, will your vnmatchable exploits be preser∣ued to posterity, that time, or obliuion shall neuer eate out or deuoure the happy memo∣ry of your eating; Yet (not to flatter you)

though you are the absolutest man of mouth, and the most renowned stifgut in this Westerne Angle of the World, yet we haue as great or greater Faters then your selfe, which are scarcely thought vpon: there are some, that with the vnsauoury sawce of Enuy, will eate vp a mans name and re∣putation, and leaue nothing but the bones and scraps of infamy and scandall; some eate vp whole Lordships without Man∣nours, and some deuoure Mannours and leaue nothing but bare Lordships: your exercise is onely for the Maw, and your Excellency consists totally in Crambo; I haue done my best to please and pleasure you. And not knowing where to finde a fit Patron, I am bold to dedicate it to your di∣gestion, wishing that your teeth & stomack may be euer sharpe-set, and that your meate may be wanting before your Appetite.
