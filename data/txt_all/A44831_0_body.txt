Right Honorable,
THough I con∣ceive Euripides speaks at as high a rate as any of the sons of Na∣ture can do,  (he that

layes his leg upon a Velvet Cushion all the day long, shall not meet with those sharp flints, those pricking thornes, and scratching briers, that will be anothers portion, who walk∣ing abroad, sees, and is not sin∣fully silent to the practical er∣rors that as a leprosie overspread the conversations of men) yet I conceive a Christian findes such wages in Gods work, that he would not  withdraw his foot from his service to dip it in oyle else∣where.
I am not without some ex∣periences (in which God give me an heart to rejoyce more) that it is much better in respect

of the outward man to sing Hosannah to the practical or opi∣nionative errors of men, then (with the great hazard that at∣tends such endeavors) to en∣gage against them: many a man hath come off with a scratcht face in appearing for truth; yet since I have meditated upon Eternity, I dare say (with Luther) Mallem ego cum Christo ruere, quam stare cum Caesare: I am not so great a stranger to the practices of this present genera∣tion, that I should not expect many an open Sepulchre in the mouths of men, threatning to bury my name and repu∣tation, as the reward of my present endeavors: yet is it

not in this respect that I have taken the boldness to my self to take Sanctuary under your Honors protection: No (my Lords) I have in this par∣ticular, a God to go to, who shall hide me in the secret of his presence, and keep me se∣cretly in a pavillion from the strife of tongues.
This small Treatise kisseth your Honors hands upon other terms: There is in it (at least) a design to hold forth some beams and rayes of the power of godliness, which hath hitherto found but little entertainment in the Courts of Princes, been owned by a very few great ones of the world: greatness and

goodness rarely kissing each other: Not many wise, not many noble are called, : Right Honorable, the eyes of good men are upon you, and they expect (under God) the fruits of your Councel (both to the people of God, and In∣habitants of this Land) medi∣ocrem : and the more our eyes are upon you, the more wicked men watch for your haltings: If there be a root of covetousness springing up in the midst of you, if any ul∣cerous bile of malice, if a swelling of pride, if a base itch of lust, if (in a word) you be , will not your enemies say, the pictures

in the hangings, and your Lorships, are Christians of the same complexion? You have but a form of godliness, you deny the power thereof: But I hope better things of you, that the place where you are assembled, will be (not as of old in name onely) White-Hall and your selves still Right Ho∣norable, accounting it your great∣est honor, to honor the Son (by whose name you are called Christians) in the power of godliness; that it may never be said of you, as Melancthon (descanting upon his name) of Hosius.  minimè sanctus.
This Treatise consulted with

in your spare (but serious) hours, will (in the strength of God) prove (as to the fore∣mentioned diseases) : You will not finde in it , such Lenten dis∣courses as were wont to drop from the silken lips of Court-Chaplins.
The work is not , pen'd for ostentation, but for the glory of JESUS CHRIST, to whom, as your Councel∣lor (that you may not ) he commends you all, and that he in whose hands all the Councels of men are, would dwell upon you, direct you for his Glory, with the Good and Peace of this Poor

wearied Land, is, and shall be the continual prayer of
