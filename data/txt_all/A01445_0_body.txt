REading this small litle Volume, fyrst writ∣ten in French, and collec∣ted by Maister Iohn Gar∣diner (right honorable) and perceiuing the same in my simple iudgement, vn∣der a poore habite and litle showe, to beare and importe great and waigh∣ty effect, finding also therin such singu∣ler ground of profound learning and rare wisdome, and therewithall such firme approbations and inexpugna∣ble
 defences, with authorities of holy writ, I thought it no lesse then neede∣full, and nothing more then necessary to doo what in me mightlye, to make the same, obuious, vsuall and familyer vnto my brethren of this Realme, by translating the same into our mother tongue. The which thing hauing once perfourmed and finished, according to my poore talent, and sclender skill: al∣though I doo not doubt to haue fol∣lowed myne Authour directlye and truly in sence and exposition, without corruption or abuse: yet finding in my selfe such imperfections of learning, such barrennes and want of fine Phrase and choise wordes wherwith to haue garnished the same, vnneathes I durst of my selfe, or in myne owne name, launch foorth my silly barke into the troublesom waues, not doubting (saile she neuer so sure & true) but somtimes shee shalbe countermet with churlishe
 byllowes, and puffed at with outragi∣ous blastes and violent tempestes. The force wherof more safely to defend and withstand, being loth to leaue the same in such obscurenesse and secrecy, as I found it, whereof no Christian man ought to be ignorant, I imagined with my selfe to seeke to ancor in your har∣borough, being very desirous that this my vnsmoothed and roughe hewen workemanshippe might haue free pas∣sage and safe conduct vnder your Ho∣nors fauorable protection and defēce. In which purpose and pretence, being abashed and more then halfe dismaied, by the occasions aforesaid: yet grewe I in double hart and tooke treble encou∣ragement, that the authoritye of the matter it selfe would more then coun∣teruaile the rest in your Honors fauo∣rable acceptaunce. But when I further considered, wherof I should craue you to be a supporter, namely of the Chris∣tian
 fayth (for so the Booke is intitu∣led, and contayneth an hundreth Ar∣ticles of the Christian fayth) all feare∣full doubtes expelled, assured truste willed mee to abyde constant in my purpose. For as to your Honorable tytle, Wisdome hath annexed her en∣largement of Authoritye: so to that Authoritye, godlye zeale hauing ad∣ioined a feruencie of true fayth, and to these also humilitye of spirite, hauing coupled franke curtesye and beneuo∣lence towardes all: These I saye, right Honorable haue made me so bolde to craue that this my small peece of tra∣uaile, whatsoeuer, maye receyue that hope hath promysed, and with my good will would gladlye deserue be∣ing no wayes able, excepte by prayer to almyghtye GOD, on whome as dutye byndeth I shall not cease con∣tynually to call for your Lordshippes
 long preseruation of lyfe, and much encrease of his moste comfor∣table blessinges.
