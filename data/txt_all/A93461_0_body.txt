Dear Country-men!
ACcept this little Manual from those that Love you as their own Souls, and would as willingly venture, or lose their Lives for that Glorious Cause in which you are engag'd, as you your selves can do it! Had we any thing better to present you, you should have it: But as this is, if you follow the Directions herein contained, you'll not fail to
secure what's of more value than all the World. It's most of it a
Collection from the Works of such great Men as are above Censure, and who are now receiving their Reward; and contracted as much as pos∣sible, to be of more general Use. May the Lord of Hosts bless it to you, and
bless you all, gi∣ving you Victory over your Sins and
Enemies, and helping you by Faith to subdue Kingdoms, like the
Primitive Worthies. Which is and shall be the hearty and
daily Prayer of,
Dear Country-men!
