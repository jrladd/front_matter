SIR, after I had builded vp these foure al∣tars of deuoti∣on, with pur∣pose to present the first of thē to your worshipful brother in Law (Sir Thomas Smith;) I knew not where to find a man that did more truely parallell him in goodnesse then you your selfe; aswell for the ornaments of mind, as for that in∣tegritie, pietie, zeale, and other ri∣ches of the soule, wherewith the world taketh especiall note, that you are (both) abundantly stored.

For that cause thefore, (as also in regard that Affinitie hath knit you together in a strong and holy league of loue) am I bold to reare vp this my second altar to the me∣morie of your name. Vpon it are offered vp Prayers onely, whose incense are as sweet odours in the nostrils of God. They are in be∣halfe of Princes and Rulers (who are the highest vpō earth) & ther∣fore doeth an Eagle carie them vp to heauen. Shee flieth now to your bosome, there to build her nest: esteeming it a happie place for her to abide in, sithence shee foreseeth (or at least with me prai∣eth) that all your thoughts, words and actions which are bred with∣in you, doe shew themselues, and so may proue still true Eagles, by being able to looke stedfastly on the sunne of righteousnesse. And thus crauing pardon for bold∣nesse, I rest:
