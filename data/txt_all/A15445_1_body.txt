HONOVRED SIR,
THose many, great, dai∣ly fauours of your Worship vnto me, euer since I came from my Honourable Lord & Master, the Earle of Montgomeries seruice, vnto your parts (which I professe haue beene my chiefest incouragement of continuing like Na∣both at Ahabs gate) and the pious practise of your Worship in all your acti∣ons; such daily, priuate, and publique praiers in your house, that meales are not more frequent then praiers, such
 care, not only to prouide spirituall food, the preaching of Gods word, to those hungry and thirsting Christians (that doe gape and long for the same, as the drie ground doth for raine in the time of drought) in your Parish Church, and Market towne of Lhan Rwste, euery se∣cond market day, but also by your owne continuall example, of comming, and neuer missing to come, your selfe, (while your health permits you) and calling others, to hearken vnto that diuine ex∣ercise, for the furtherance of the same. And then such kinde and louing enter∣tainment of vs Prophets and the Pro∣phets children at your table, where we haue conuiuium theologicum: and are most commonly able to make a Iurie of Ministers vpon any controuersiall point of Diuinity, so as I am sure in Wales none, in England I thinke few haue the like: and such a desire to haue all the poore ignorant people of that coun∣trey instructed in the Catechisme and principles of Christian religion, and many more such like fruits of grace. And likewise the worthie seruice vnto your King, and the great good that you
 doe vnto your countrey, by the recon∣ciling of many variances, the punishing of lewd offendors, maintaining the pub∣lique peace and tranquillity of all, and especially the releeuing of so many poore as you doe, both at your doores, and by your purse, for which you haue so many praiers and intercessors: & impossibile est multorum preces non exaudiri (as S. Chrysostome speaketh.)
I say these things, and many like fruits of grace and peace, that I might iustly speake of, would proue me to be vn∣thankfull, and vnworthy of your loue, and indeed vnmindfull of my dutie to God and his Church, if I did not ac∣knowledge those many kindnesses, that I haue receiued from your Worship, and likewise set downe some of those fruits of piety, and good workes, that you doe both in Church and Commonwealth, to be a patterne vnto your brethren, to be imitated herein, and especially to those three worthy Knights, your sonne and sonnes in law, and all the rest of your children and posteritie, which God hath blessed, and blessed them all (I doubt not but for your sake, and your
 most milde and vertuous Lady, who brought a blessing vnto your house) equall in grace, in vertue, and in all faire carriage, to the best mans children that I doe know; that when they see not you, when you doe see the face of God in glorie, they may euer see the true records of your pietie and practise, for their honour and patterne for imita∣tion: for howsoeuer I, dust and ashes, am nothing, of none account, and shall re∣turne to nothing, yet I hope I may say of this my poore labours of veritie, as the Poet said of his labors of vanity, that—nec Iouis ira, nec ignis, Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.
And therefore I presumed out of my vnfained loue, to insert your honoured name in the frontispice of this tract. Ac∣cept it as the token of a thankfull heart; for though you may haue many greater friends, yet will I euer rest in the number of your truest and faithfullest friends,
