Right Worthy Sir,
IN these ingratefull daies of ours, wherein mens merits are forgotten, with the expiration of the
life; and that too many doe glory, to leaue happy or vnhappy posterities behinde them to 
their memories liue when they are gone; or else put a vaine hope of a long lasting same, by e∣cting
painted vaine-glorious Sepulchers, and marble Monuments, whilst small are the
ber of those that by Piety, Charity, Noble and vertuous Actions, and good life and conuersation, 
seeke to attaine the neuer-fading memory of Eternity, and true lmmortality, so that it is a doubt, wh∣ther
the death of the good, or the life of the bad, are most to be lamented: Yet although the true worth
this deceased Right Reuerend, Right Honourable and right Learned Father, (whom God in merry 
taken from the euill to come) is of that inuincible and impregenable strength, that the flattery or battle
of future time cannot beat it downe into the gulfe of obliuion and forget fulnesse, yet (though we
lesse) I in dutious loue and reuerence to the Dead, and true in affection to the liuing (amongst whom  
of my departed Lords Friends and Seruants, I am much endeared and oblieged vnto) I haue set 
rudely to paper, and as I could (though not as I should) I haue as it were onley look'd into the Sui
of a goodly City, tasted Manna afarre off, and touched the skirts or hem of his meritorious vertues; wh
I have made bold to dedicate to your Worships graue and iudicious view and censure, humbly desir
your VVorship to accept my intention more then my Labour, in hope whereof, I cease to enlarge my E
further, wishing you such happinesse in this life, as is correspondent to your worth, and such, felicity in 
life to come, as is layd vp for good men in Heauen.
