Madam;
BEing lately necessitated to pass some dayes in a place, where I had but little Company, and less Diversion, I re∣solved

to spend my idle houres in Translating this Relation of the Misfortunes of poore Don Carlos.
It was Written by a Person of Honour, and one, that pretends to have a particular in∣sight into the Spanish History.
Yet, least his Autho∣rity should not seem sufficient in some dubi∣ous passages, he backs

it with that of the most Famous Writers of the last Age.
His Design (as you may see by his own Ad∣vertisement) was chief∣ly to Vindicate the Queen of Spaine's Ver∣tue, from the Asper∣sions, that had been cast upon it by some Malicious Pens; and mine is no other, then to divert you, and by this small testimony

of my Affection, to Assure You, that I am,
MADAM,
