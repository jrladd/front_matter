Sir,
SInce VVorkes of this kinde
haue beene lately estee∣med
worthy the Patro∣nage
of some of our wor∣thiest
Nobles, I haue made
no doubt to preferre this
of mine to your vndoubted Vertue, and ex∣ceeding
true Noblesse: as contayning mat∣tr
no lesse deseruing your reading, and ex∣citation
to Heroycall life, then any such
late Dedication. Nor haue the greatest Prin∣ces
of Italie, and other Countries, conceiued
it any least diminution to their greatnesse,

to haue their Names wing'd with these Tra∣gicke
Plumes, and disperst by way of Pa∣tronage,
through the most Noble Notices
of Europe.
Howsoeuer therefore in the Scaenicall pre∣sentation,
it might meete with some malig∣ners,
yet considering, euen therein, it past
with approbation of more worthy iudge∣ments;
the Ballance of their side (especi∣ally
being held by your impartiall hand) I
hope will to no graine abide the out-weigh∣ing.
And for the autenticall truth of eyther
person or action, who (worth the respect∣ing)
will expet it in a Poeme, whose sub∣iect
is not truth, but things like truth? Poore
enuious soules they are that cauill at truths
want in these naturall fictions: materiall in∣struction,
elegant and sententious excitation
to Vertue, and deflection from her contrary;
being the soule, lims, and limits of an auten∣ticall
Tragedie. But whatsoeuer merit of
your full countenance and fauour suffers
defect in this, I shall soone supply with
some other of more generall account:
wherein your right vertuous Name made

famous and preserued to posteritie, your
future comfort and honour in your present
acceptation, and loue of all vertuous and
diuine expression; may be so much past
others of your Rancke encreast, as they are
short of your Iudiciall Ingenuitie, in their due
estimation.
For, howsoeuer those Ignoble and sowre∣brow'd
VVorldlings are carelesse of what∣soeuer
future, or present opinion spreads of
them; yet (with the most diuine Philo∣sopher,
if Scripture did not confirme it) I
make it matter of my Faith; that we truely
retaine an intellectuall feeling of Good or
Bad after this life; proportionably answera∣ble
to the loue or neglect we beare here to
all Vertue, and truely-humane Instruction:
In whose fauour and honour I wish you most
eminent; And rest euer.
