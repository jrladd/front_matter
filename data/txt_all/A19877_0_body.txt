My Lord,
THE vnciuill ignorance of the People, had depriu'd this hum∣ble worke of life; but that your Lordships approbation, stept in, to succour it. Those many that came with resolution to dispraise (knowing your Lordships iudgement, to be powerfull, aboue their malice) were eyther corre∣cted to an vnderstanding, or modesty: And this large benefit, hath betray'd your Lordship to a De∣dication. I am bold to beleeue, fancies of this com∣posure, haue beene nobly entertayn'd, by the most knowing Princes of the World: The ignorance,

that begets the change in this our age, it may become your Lordships example, to correct, mee to lament; if so tame a passion, can possesse a Poet, and one, ex∣alted with a hope to be receiu'd
