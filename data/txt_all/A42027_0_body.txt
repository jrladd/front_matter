SIR,
YOV have been a merciful Creditor in the trust of
these inestimable Poems, so long with me, a
person inconsiderable; But I beseech you think
I have been sensible of the great obligation,
and alwayes thought it a less trespass to break
with all the world, then by the least forgetfulness of my duty,
make an unhappy forfeit of my self to your displeasure.
Sir, I have brought home your Principal, and though it
be a thing beneath your generous expectation, to look at profit, yet
I thought it became my justice to tender you a small interest,
the endevours of my poor Art, to wait upon it: I acknowledge
it a bold undertaking, to compose your Words (which are so
pure Harmonie in themselves) into any other Musick; But
it was not in my ambition, or hope to mend the least Accent or
Emphasis wch they received from your own numerous Soul,
but to essay, how neer, a whole life spent in the study of Musical
Compositions, could imitate the flowing and natural Graces,
which you have created by your fancie.
I have onely to say, If my zeal have not stained what you
have excellently made, I will not despair of your pardon; and
if any thing herein (the wel-meant tender of my service) may
obtain your smile & permission, I shalbe confirmed in my thoughts
that I may stil write my self
SIR,
