GENTLEMEN,
HAving in the late evil Times (never to be forgotten) been comforted and re∣lieved by the real Favours and pious Munificence of your Noble Parents, I do gladly make this grateful Remembrance thereof in the Dedication of this part of my Memorials of Worthy Persons to your Worthy
 Names. In these Papers, though it were my principal design to honour the me∣mory of the Lights of our own Church, yet have I now and then taken in one of the Roman or Genevian Perswasion, thinking They might not be unsociable here, whose holy Souls▪ I believe (now that the Certamina are ended by death pulveris exigui jactu) test in peace. Some Hyprcriticks (who are pleas'd with no∣thing but what they do themselves, if yet they do any thing at all:) will de∣spise me, and say I do actum agere, and write what is written already. Truly, as a Historian does not make, but frame and compose his matter; so an Historical Collector performs his Undertaking, when with diligence and judgment he selecteth and compileth dispersed pieces for the ease and benefit of his Rea∣ders.
If in this Collection I have done any service to Young Gentlemen, and other ingenuous Persons, to incline them more to love piety and learning, to converse
 with good Men and good Books, to be∣come loving friends and Patrons, or obe∣dient servants and Ministers to the Church of England; This is my Delight and Joy; This is, to me, instead of Praise, or any other Reward of my well∣meant Endeavours.
That I have inscribed upon the parti∣culars, the names of other friends, is upon the most friendly Plinies reason, Ingenuum est fateri per quos profeceris.
