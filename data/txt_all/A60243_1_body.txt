Chr. Ch. Oxon, Dec. 26—78.
Reverend Sir,
I Am to give you thanks for the occasion you gave me of acquaintance with the bearer hereof, Mr. James Salgado, whom I find by his discourse to be a right Spaniard, born of a good Family, and of very good parts; and to have suffered very much by the Inquisition of Spain for embracing the Truth of our Protestant Religion. This consideration, and the great bounty and charity I saw used by his Countrey∣men towards ours, when found in distress among them, makes me think him an object singularly well deser∣ving our common charity and benevolence; especially considering how very rare a case it is to see a Clergy∣man of his Nation come to us. They have been civil to him in this Ʋniversity, and I hope good men will be so to him with you. To such as may desire to learn the Spanish or Italian Tongue, he may be serviceable, having good skill in both, but in the former he is emi∣nent, as born and bred in Madrid. I will presume to beg the continuance of your goodness to him, af∣fording him your instruction and commendation to good men there; for some employment he may be capa∣ble of, by which you shall oblige much
Reverend Sir,
