WHen I was obliged to appear to preach a Visitation Sermon amongst you, I made it my bu∣siness not to court Applause, nor use a popu∣lar Text; but to insist on what might really be suitable to our Times, and serviceable to our Church and Holy Calling.
And considering the Foreign War our Nation is engaged in, the intestine Schism our Church and Religion suffers by, I could not suppose a more fit Subject might be found, than what I chose, to oblige the Prayers and Endeavours of all our Church's. Members for its Peace; which I am sure none can be against, but such Incendiaries as delight in publick Miseries.

When I appeared, I must gratefully own, the Serenity of your Complexions shewed what you are happy in, and my Endeavours want∣ed, an inward Goodness and Candour.
But tho' my Sermon was then received so kindly by many of you, yet have I and it met with such Censures and Reflections since, that I am forced to let it speak for it self. And as I never yet was concerned in the least Prosecution of any Dissenter, (tho li∣ving always in the midst of them, I endea∣voured by Reasons to reconcile them to our Church:) So I hope these Pages will de∣monstrate me to have had no other Design, than the uniting us at home, that our Church and Nation may be happy, whose Felicity next to Gods Glory, I shall ever make the great End of my Study, who am,
