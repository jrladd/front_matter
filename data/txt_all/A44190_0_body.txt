May it please your Grace;
WHEN the follow∣ing
Papers of the
famous Lord Hol∣les,
Your Great Uncle, hap∣pen'd
to fall into my Hands,

I could not long deliberat
whether they deserv'd a pub∣lic
View, and therefore in∣tended
to get them printed
without any further Ceremo∣ny;
for the large share he had
in the Transactions of those
Times will as much engage
others to read these Memoirs,
as the Defence he was oblig'd
to make for himself are a suffi∣cient
Reason for his writing
them. But when I under∣stood
that Your Grace (out
of the Love You bear to vir∣tuous
Actions, and Your Pi∣ety
towards so near a Relati∣on)
did order a stately Mo∣nument
to be erected at Dor∣chester
for this Illustrious Per∣son,

I was of opinion, that as
well for that Reason, as be∣cause
in his Life-time he en∣tertain'd
an extraordinary Af∣fection
and Esteem for You,
Your Name should in like
manner be inscrib'd on this
Monument which he has left
of Himself to Posterity. The
Justice of the thing, and the
Sincerity of my Intentions,
must be all my Apology to
Your Grace for this Presum∣tion:
for the Public (of
whom You deserv'd so well,
and particularly in appearing
early, like Your Noble An∣cestors,
for the Liberty of
these Nations) will acknow∣ledg
it an Obligation; nor,

if any thing should chance to
be amiss, can I doubt but an
easy Pardon will be granted to
one who is, tho unknown,
my Lord, with so profound
a Respect, Your Grace's most
humble Servant.
