IT is the manner of some writers (right worship∣full) when they will set foorth some péece of worke, that they haue compyled or made, to excuse the rashenesse of the edition thereof, as béeing by their friends counsell, or for some other cause, now mo∣ued to commend & commit that to the vse or iudge∣ment of many, which at first they thought should be but a priuat excercise to them selues, or some priuie pleasure to a few. This thing whether they all do in simplicitie of hart & sinceritie, or some of them for some other cause, I cannot iudge, but I do excuse my selfe that I do not follow the lowe steps of such humilitie, because the truth is in déed, that at the beginning, when I first began to collect this booke, which I haue now at last after a long time, and with much more laboure and paines, than ye can possibly thinke, cōtriued and brought to some perfection (for the gathering of oure Englishe wordes, and deuiding of the same into this alphabet or∣der of the last sillabls, being a trade not of any man afore attemp∣ted, or by the other Dictionaries any thing to recken vp helped & furthered, must needs be a long trauaile) I thought and did alway entend, with so much spéed as I could, to publishe and set abroade the same, as well for the commodities in the preface to the reader contained, as also for conscience sake, thinking that wher I haue bene long conuersant in the schooles, and haue from tyme to tyme lamented to sée the youth of our Cuntry (in the studie of the Latin tong) lacke such little instruments, as this fit and néedful for their exercises, and sawe no man set his hand to the same, I was bound for the portion of my small talent to do somewhat therin, though I knowe that I shoulde for my laboure, ieoperd one of these two displeasures: either if I did it not well, (for the world is now fine and disdainefull) to be counted rude and ignorante, or else if I did neuer so well (being harde to escape euill tongs) to be estéemed a
foole, as one that for suche a trifling thing as this, with lesse profyt and more paines, would forsake a better and more worthie study, with lesse trauaile and more gaynes. Yea and some will say more ouer, that it is a superfluous & vnnecessarie labour, to set forth this Dictionarie, for so muche as Maister Howlet, hath sette forthe so worthie a worke of the same kinde already. But I answere, that though it be a worthy worke in déede, as it is most worthie, and be also of the same kind in generall, & yet it is neyther of the same kind in speciall, nor to the same purpose deuised in many things, for his is great & costly, this is little & of light price, his is for gre∣ter students, & them yt are richable to haue it, this is for beginners, & them that are pooreable to haue no better, his is ful of phrases & sentences fit for them ye vse oration & oratorie, this is onely stuf∣fed full of words, & the vse thereof fit for thē that are not yet come to better exercises, who if they should haue no Dictionarie at all to help them forward, til such time as they were able to haue one to vse, the other, & ther be no more to be had but halfe ones that be to no good purpose, what time should be lost? what years should be spent? surely not a little: like as if no man should worke in the Mint, but such as brought with them golden hammers, ye should haue little worke done, whilst pore men, that for néede would la∣bour, could not haue such tooles to worke withal, & the rich which peraduēture could haue them, yet for their accustomed ease & idle occupations, would take little paines therwith. Neither can they wel say, yt though euery scholer may not priuatly, haue this great Dictionarie, & enioy her priuatly to him self: yet euery schoole hath or may haue one of them in commō, which may serue for them al, for neither will all parents so agrée to haue one for all: and if they would, yet it should be such a like thing, as if ye had but one toole to worke with in the mynt, which whilst one workeman did occu∣pie, al the other should be idle, and so the worke go little forward, and surely by copie of Dictionaries, are copie of wordes coyned in our schooles. But I néede not much centend in this matter being playne inoughe of it selfe, nether do I so muche care for any of the thinges aforesaide, either profit or paine, tauntes or disdaine, foo∣lishnesse or finenesse, or for any of other such like vanities, as I do
(let thē say what they wil) for my dutie towards the youth of my Country, if perchance I might do them some pleasure herein: be∣seching your Maistership in like manner, that youre worship will for the same causes (for ye haue euer bene a louer & helper of good studies) neither be ashamed, nor displeased, to let so little and rude a thing procéede in the commendation of youre good name to the same end, séeing that here we séeke not for praise or profit, but for the prosperous good procéeding of our poore youth in good learning and knowledge, which thing if your goodnesse and patiēce wil do, ye shall both bind and encourage me at all times, to my power to laboure and endeuoure my selfe, beth to further our schooles with such poynts of my paines, and to gra∣tifie your worship with a better work an other day, and also ye shall deserue to be the best benefactor in this businesse, and to be partaker of all their prayers, that may take profit hereby, to God for your Mastership, in helth and prosperitie, with en∣crease of much worship long to continue. Amen.
