My LORD,
THAT this Essay comes not from Rallery, or Picque, and to pay home the World in its own coyn; nor yet in an ostentuous man∣ner to impose upon Men, in a matter of such moment, I know no such effectual

way to evince; as by first sujcting it to the Touchstone of so exquisit and solid a Judg∣ment as your Lps, you my Lbeing the great Master of Justice & Reasoning, must also be a Judge most sufficient, of what is Relevant or Consequential here: And further your learned Elucubrations in Natural Know∣ledge (so very near of Kin to Medicine) giving evidence that your Lordship is no Judge incompetent whither or not there be any sound Philosophy in mine.
By very good consequence then, your Lordships publict Character, bringing your eminent Qualifications upon the publick Stage, to exert themselves for general U∣tility, (the only Heroick Action Man is capable of,) at once giving you the oportu∣nity, and making it your concern, to con∣tribute all your Talents for the publick good and as a no small mean to that end for the Improvement of Medicine also, does notably both qualify your Lp: a very fit Patron for such a Subject; & encourage me to implore your protection thereto life & health being so

great Blissings and Benefits to Mankind, makes it indeed no small part of the Poli∣ticians Interest, to lay out himself all man∣ner of ways consistent with his Capacity and Function, for the advancement of Me∣dicine, in relation to the preservation and procurement thereof to the People: as was lately done by the Vice-Roy of Naples, in ordaining several consults to that purpose.
Now besides such Consults as these to be authorized by the publick, I know no such effectual course for the growth and im∣provement of Medicine, as that your Lord∣ship and others in Authority, indued with capacity, would be pleased to set a part some peice of your time, to pry into the Medical Art; and indeed this is so far, from a digression from your main work, that be∣ing an extraordinary piece of service for the Publick, it seemes no small part there∣of: fr thus being in a manner Censors over Physitians, you would both excite their Industry, and Scar such as Labour to Shel∣ter themselves there, out of the Starting Holes of Artifice and Prudence.
And thus may be in part, Recompensced the Detriment that Medicine, and in Con∣sequence the Publick Sustaines, by that Arts being under the misfortune to be Ri∣val'd of the most pregnant Spirits by these other Studies of Law and Pollicy; Such be∣ing for the most part allured to the Cul∣ture of these Disciplines, leaving Medicine to these of a lower Rank.
And indeed in this Branch of the Poli∣ticians duety, that most Stupenduous Witt, the Lord Verulam has so successfully La∣boured, that giving a President, he has al∣so given a Patern hereof; For that Ful∣gent Beam of Learning amidst so many dispatches and blandishments of the Court, did not only display a great many Resplen∣dent Rays of the first &true Experimental Phylosophy, and descending into, aked up the Bowells of all Arts and Sciences: but dived so deep into the Penetralia of Medicine, as may give us an earnest (to be remem∣bered with regrate, that his Stares did not

dispose him alone to that Study) what such an acute and Penetrating Spirit was Capable of in that Art, had the whole edge of his Vivacious Ingine been bended to Medicine, the Force indeed of the mind like all other things being diffused giving more Faint Hitts then being recolected & Intent upon one Subject it's able to do.
And seeing your Lordships Stars has disposed you also beside Medicine, and conducted you unto the spacious Feilds of the Law, where you have made such am∣ple Excursions & Progress to the great Ho∣nour & Credit of this Nation, albeit with less general Advantage to the whole world, then if you had been a Son & Cul∣tivator of this our Art; Yet it must be Confessed that you have done Noblely, and made a Notable Essay to repair that Damnage to Medicine, that having several Sons, all of most pregnant Spirits (the eldest whereof, called thereto by the greatest of Men, who must also be the

best Judge of Men deservedly sits at the Helm of this Nation,) Your Lordship has bestowed one to labour in this Art also, who having already given so emi∣nent a specimen of Sagacity, by his imbrace∣ing this method of the Cure of Fevers, it cannot be questioned, but time will com∣pleat in him all these Expectations becom∣ing the Son of such a Father.
Emulation and Envy notwithstanding of al the Attempts they are capable of, can never be able to cloud Your Lordships au∣spicious conduct, suitable to the station that Povidence put you then in; and that in the times of greatest danger this Nation was in; your Lordship being like another Ioseph by Providence kept at that time in the Govenment to allay and wand off the current of the oppression of these times, but when designes became to be poussed with that violence, that they were too hard for such mild measures, your Lordships Sta∣tion then made you capable of; another

cast of Providence, as a proper expedient, sent you into that Countrey where was con∣trived, adjusted, and from which shortly thereafter was brought over, Our Deliverance. What your Lordship's part was in this Transaction, thô reason of State may still conceal, yet the care & concern with which that great Instrument of Our Liberation still follows your Lordship, gives full evidence that you did act a part sutable to your self in that Juncture also.
And indeed your Lordships Family fal∣ling under so benevolent Aspect of that He∣roick PRINCE (Novv our Soveraign) has a notable opportunity put into your hands, to signalize your Nobility with a true and radient Lustre, in your being Instrumental to bring about such Improve∣ments as are sutable to the Soil and Geni∣ous of this Country, by such culture as your Lp: and other publick Spirits, knows it by Industry or Reformation capable of & would quite change the figure of this languish∣ing

Nation: And among others the Im∣provement of the desolate state of Medi∣cine also, of which upon some represen∣tation made by me thereof, your Lordship was very sensible, and to this purpose its humbly represented, as a propper expedi∣ent, that publick Authority would be pleased to Incite and Incourage the Col∣ledge of Physitians here, by authorizing them to such Consults as these lately held at Naples, to make all apposit Overtures for the Instauration of Medical Practice.
If I had borrowed to this Essay any ma∣terials from the rich Mine of your Physio∣logia, this critical Age might have con∣structed it a forestalling of your Lordships Patronage, and attributed your protection rather to recompense, than to the product of an unbayessed Judgement, and withal as your Lordships exquisite Thoughts are uncapable of any accession from my mi∣nuteness, so I humbly depositate mine at

your Feet as a Testimony of my Venera∣tion, and take the liberty to Subscribe my self,

From my Study, Edinburgh, the 13th. of Iuly. 1691.
