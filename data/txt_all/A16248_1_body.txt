HAuing (by your Honorable command)
translated this Decameron, or Cen∣to
Nouelle, sirnamed Il Principe
Galeotto, of ten dayes seuerall dis∣courses,
grounded on variable and sin∣guler
Arguments, happening betweene
seauen Noble Ladies, and three ver-Honourable
Gentlemen: Although not attyred in such elegant
cy of phrase, or nice curiosity of stile, as a quicker and more
sprightly wit could haue performed, but in such home-borne
language, as my ability could stretch vnto; yet it commeth (in
all duty) to kisse your Noble hand, and to shelter it selfe vnder
your Gracious protection, though not from the leering eye, and
ouer-lauish tongue of snarling Enuy; yet from the power of his
blasting poyson, and malice of his machinations.
