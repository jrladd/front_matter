RIght Worshipful and graue Sena∣tor: if my knowledge and lear∣ning, were answerable to my good will and affection: this my poore labour now mourning in a sable Weede, should be as great and precious, as to the contrary it is weake, and slender. And knowing that the Vertuous minde, respecteth not so much the valewe of the guift, as the good will of the giuer, emboldeneth me to pre∣sēt this smal Pamphlet to your Worships view; most humbly crauing pardon for my rash attempt, which if to your wonted clemmencie I doe obtaine. I shall liken my selfe to a poore Debtor owing much, free∣ly forgiuen of all his large reckonings and dange∣rous accounts, and bound in duty to pray for your Worships long life, with increase of honor.
