SIr; your willingnes to haue beene present at the preaching of this Sermon, restrained on∣ly by instant, & urgent occasions, as my selfe well know, hath moved me to deliver vnto your minde by reading, that, which otherwise you would, but could not receiue by hearing. And this rea∣son is generall, for all of like minde, I meane, which are zealous of godly do∣ctrine; made publike by preaching, as Christ commādeth; but more publike,Matth. 28.19. by printing, as Christians also desire. And if my small store in handling this Scripture, very briefly in some points, for wāt of time, hath yet afforded this, a plaster for the sore of some Mini∣sters, & people now, as I hope it hath
what should my desire be, but that the same may be spread as broad, & lie on so long, as the sore requireth, by this large, & lasting delivery therof, as you see. Onlie I beseech the greater Phy∣sitians to have an eye to the sore, and to wag the plaster; and if they see it heale not, to adde (as I hope they wil) some cunning of their owne: and yet not their owne, but that, which they have learned, more deeplie then I, of the greate Physitiā of our soules Christ Iesus. Vnto whose grace I com∣mend you, and yours, and us all, for the cure of all our sores,Rev. 22.20. and come, Lord Iesus: even so, Amen.
From Wotton Basset  the 20. of Oct. 1596.
