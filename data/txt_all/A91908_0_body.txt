Much Honoured Sir,
THe experience that I have of your can∣dour and ingenuitie, emboldens me here to prefix your name, not from any worth in the worke performed on my part; but in respect of the subject mattter of this book, which is a decla∣ration of that mutuall intercourse and vicissitude of divine love, passing betweene Christ, and the Church his Spouse; set forth by a most sweet and comfortable, by a most excellent and ravishing Allegorie, of a Marriage-Song: Marriage being the most joyfull passage of all our life, and a Song being the highest expression of joy; by

this amiable resemblance, is the souls spiritual conjuncti∣on with Christ, most lively delineated: Oh! the supere∣min nt excellency of divine love; tis the glorie of God, the joy of his heart, tis the fulnesse of Christ, his Crowne and dignitie, tis the worke of the Spirit, in all its opera∣tions, tis the Song of Angels, and their continual delight: tis the sourse and spring of true happinesse to all Saints: the Sanctuary and support of their dejected soules: This o∣pens the Fathers bosome, draws forth the affections of Christ, and melts mens hearts into each others; the sweet sense whereof is the breath of our nostrils, and the life of our union with him.
Noble Sir, I have but three words to speake, The first is, of you: the second, to you: the third, for you.
That of you is to testifie, that as the Lord hath called you to high and honourable imployment, so he hath raised your Spirit suitable to the worke in hand; wherein you stood as a Rock immoveable in the middest of stormes and tempests, having (like Obed-Edom) owned the Arke, when few would owne it, ventring all that was dear unto you, accounting godlinesse the greatest gaine, when others have reckoned it their losse, esteeming that your honour, that others have deemed their shame. Though it be granted, that Truth needs no Pa∣tron (veritas stat in aperto campo) being better able to support, honour, and advance us, then we can that, yet thrice happy and blessed are they that owne it: there∣fore the more you engage for Truth, the more will truth dignifie and advance you. Whatsoever you expend for Christ, in Christ you shall find it againe, and shall receive your owne, with the greatest advantage. The Philosophers expression of good is, Bonum est-sui communicatum: Good is communicative; the more good therefore you

shall expend, the more shall you discover a prin∣ciple of goodnesse to dwell in your heart, flowing from the fountaine of fulnesse, distilling from Christ.
And that you have engaged me with many undeserved favours, I should be ingratefull either to deny or forget them: though I cannot make you a retaliation, (Nihil dat quod non habet) yet that you may know, kind∣nesses are ner forgotten in a thank full breast, give me leave to present this as witnesse, and testimony of my gratitude to you-wards; being confident you will receive it. as I present it, with the spirit of love.
That to you is, that you would fix your affections upon, and let the whole streame of them runne unto that only delectable, and love deserving Object Christ, who is the glorie of all delights, and abstract of all praises. Its the nature of true joy, to delight it selfe in some solid good, and there is no good can be compared cum summo bono with that only chiefe and eternall good, that is treasured up in Christ.
When wee suffer the creatures to steale away our affecti∣ons, we not only lose the right use of them, but thereby be∣reave our selves of true comfort in God, render our selves dishonourable in the eyes of good men, and unprofitable to our selves: for though the creatures may serve us, yet they cannot love us; tis only Christ that can make sweet re∣turnes of love, for our love. In which gracious manife∣stations of Christ, our hearts are made a Spring of li∣ving waters, a garden of spirituall delight, the mu∣sick of heavenly joyes, the treasure of divine comforts, and by the impressions of that heavenly love, and the sweet glimmerings and flashes of light, life, and glorie in Christ, our soules are abundantly refreshed, and satisfied,

as with marrow and fatnesse. Then (Sir,) this will be your Crowne and glory, this is that will heighten your spi∣rit, ennoble your minde, enlarge your heart, and make you most acceptable to God, precious in the fight of men, and exquisitely carry you through your weighty imploy∣ments. It is said of Solomon (that excellent Sonne of wisdome) that his heart was as large as the Sea, viz. in judgement and understanding: so shall your judge∣ment, wisedome, and understanding be enlarged, accor∣ding to the largenesse of Christs love living in you. The Jewes were to offer those creatures in sacrifice unto God, which the Nations worshipped for their God: so though o∣ther men fall downe and doe hommage to the creatures; yet let it be in your heart, to sacrifice them all unto the Creator. Surely man is never more straightned, then when he is bound and pent up in the narrow compasse, and scantinesse of earthly things: for let his heart stoop ne∣ver so low, the World fals beneath it; and let him ad∣vance the world to the greatest height, his heart is still above it. But in relation to Christ (cujus contrarium verum est) the matter is farre otherwise: for when mans desires and affections soar never so high, as an Eagle; still Christ is above them, fils them, answers them, yea he doth exceedingly heighten, enlarge, and abundantly satisfie them.
Sir, I shall conclude with a word for you, expressing the desires of my spirit on your behalfe: that the Lord would be pleased to fill your precious soule with the excee∣ding riches of his love, grace, and favour, and cause his glorie to shine upon you so, as to transforme you into the image of his glorie: that the sweet kisses of Christs lips, may be more precious to you, then fragrant wine, and his

name then the richest oyniment, that the senses of your soule may be more refreshed with his redolent sweetnesse, and filled more with his redundant fulnesse, then withall the most delightfull things in the world; yea, that Christ would please to lodge all night betwixt your Breasts, con∣tinually dwelling in your heart and affections, and that he would come into your soule, as into his garden, to eate his pleasant fruits, his honey, with his honey-comb; and to gather his myrrhe with his spices; that by his divine influence, your soule may be filled with all the aromaticall fruits of the Spirit: And lastly, that you would cast down your Crown and glory at the feet of Christ, who will be the glory of your Crowne here, and your Crowne of eter∣nall glorie hereafter.
