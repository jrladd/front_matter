VVHEN Poets write th' Immortal Worth of Kings,
From what blost Source their Glorious Actions springs;
They may, with less Ambition justly claim,
The Umbrage of some high-born Prince's Name:
Such as great Norfolk; boldly may assume,
Next to his Sov raigns Right, as justly due to him.
When Bosworth Field was once the glorious Scene,
Where Norfolk's Blood did noble Hanours gain:
When youthful Surrey did as bravely show,
How far a true Heroick Soul dunst go:
When Moubrey's Lyon for Example strove,
To kill the Brutish Herd, to gain the Conq'rors Love:
Which none deserv'd with greater worth we find,
A noble Birth joyn'd with a gen'rous Mind.



Honour is talk'd of much, but where's the Name,
So much of Honour from their Ancestors dare claim,
Embalm'd with Glory, and Eternal Fame.
What can the Noble Off-sppring be, but brave,
That such Allyance from the Great and Noble have.
And that first Pow'r is still the gen'rous Soul,
That actuates and moves the mighty whole.
And that high Genius does it self disperse,
Through Howard's Intelectual Universe.
The Muses I am sure will bless my Choice,
When Norfolk's Name shall echo from my Voice.
This mighty Theme cou'd come to none but you,
Your Noble Station calling it your due;
Of Honours Laws made Judge and Patron too:
Well may you then these humble Lines deserve.
Cou'd they, Immortal as your Honour live.
Cou'd such strong Torrents on my Numbers rowl,
Great as your Worth, capacious as your Soul:
Then might I boast no vain Poetick Fire,
But such as Homer might himself admire,
When Jove with Harmony did him inspire.
And such the Gods might sure bestow on me,
When I essay the high-born Norfolk's Pedegree:
But more, when boldly I essay to sing
Th' Imortal Triumphs of the greatest King.
