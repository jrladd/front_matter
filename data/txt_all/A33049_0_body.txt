RIGHT HONOURABLE,
DId the indeavours of my Artless Pen suite with the Judicious Ingenuity of my Au∣thour, I might bee capable of indulging a Hope, that the Grandeur of your Persons, temper'd with the Candour of your Mindes, would finde something here that may help to wing your Houres; Since in this volume are represented in Green years, Maturity of Iudgement; in High Fortunes, Humility; in Authority, Discretion; in Abundance, Sobriety mixt with Generosity; Neither is wanting Valour accompanied with Honour (which have been the Marks, and are now the known Favorites of Your vertuous Inclinations) or Piety joyned with Purity, whereof you are living Copies, or
 rather perfect Modells. Here the Passions are painted in their severall Convulsion-fits, the Excesses and Transports of which may raise no unpleasing reflexions upon the calme & untroubled freedome of your Spirits; In summe, you will finde the grave BELLEY hath stored his Principall Subject with both your own pretious Plenty, as if your severall vertues had sate while he drew his IPHIGENE; and I hope it will not offend you to see your Faces in such a Mirrour. Hee was so happy in his Addresses of the Originall that by the support and Patronage of that Prince∣ly Pair, the Duke of VANTADOUR and the Princess of TINGRY his Lady, it added no mean lustre to his deserving Pen, and got him such a spreading Applause from all his Readers, that a Third Impression sufficed not to satisfy their Curiosities. Suffer his Example then to excuse my Presumpti∣on, and give this Adventurous VIRAGO leave to fight her Battailes in both the Camps of LOVE and VALOUR under your Banners; Which granted (though Combated by Calumny and Criticisme) Shee cannot faile to come off Victorious. I am not insensible that this English Habit becomes Her worst of all her Wardrobe, but there is a Power in your Acceptance to make Plainness, a Fashion; and teach the World to deale gently with the defects of
RIGHT HONORABLE,
