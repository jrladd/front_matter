MADAME I haue receiued many favours from you, and doe in thankfullnesse present

vnto your Ladishippe this my translation of Minutius Felix his di∣alogue which consists of three speakers, M. Mi∣nucius Felix, Cecilius Natalis, and Octavius Ianuarius. The one is judge, the other produ∣ces in a flourishing ora∣tion all the arguments of the Gentiles against Christian religion, and the third makes vnto them such cleare an∣sweare

as I belieue it will reioyce a Christian reader to vnderstand. Wherefore as the better sort of Greekes, Romans, Italian, French and others haue taken a pleasure to render vnto their owne nation what they found worthy in other languages, I in this litle peece haue fol∣lowed their example, an∣necting vnto it some∣thing of my owne, for

nearenesse of subject, pray Madame let either haue your acceptance, and know me
