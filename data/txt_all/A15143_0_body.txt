WHen I (good M. MAIN∣VVARING) had made this sim∣ple Nosegaye: I was in minde to bestow the same on some dere frind, of which number I haue good occa∣sion to accompt you chiefe: But waying with my selfe, that although the Flowers bound in the same were good: yet so little of my labour was in them that they were not ( be they should) to bee for the least of a great num∣ber of benefits, which haue frō time to time (euen from our Childhoo) receaued of you: yet  by me, you be occasioned to say, as AN∣TIATER sDEMADES of Athens, that him with geueing, I woulde o y selfe ffied, gratifye your Guifts, and also by the  confessions that by deedes you haue deserued benefits: which as DIOGENES

saith) is  worth then be eu or  by receauing of many  benefits (Which to do is not alotted me) to accquit your cur∣tesies, I come to prefer youpore  which hauing no goods, ca with his hands full of water to meet the Persian Prince withal, who respecting the good wyll of the man did not disdayne his sim∣ple Guift: euen so, I being  to bestow some Present on you, by the same thinking to make part of aonder for the merited, to perfourme the dutie of a friend, expresse the good wyll that should rest in Countrie folke, & not ha∣uyng of mine owne to discharge that I go about (like to that poore Fellow which  into an others ground for his water) did shaping anothers garden for these Flowers: which I  you (as DARI∣VS did,) to accept: and though they be of ano∣thers growing, yet considering they be of my owne gathering and making spect my labour and regard my good wil and  them, but vouch to be a protected him from the spight∣ful, which (perhaps) wilhat leith as presen∣ted you, or gathered thad done one, or both: and so might spoyle Nosegay, and not to let it come so happili  handes, as I wish it mai. And though the Garden of your godly mind be full fraught with  Flowers, which I

know in your infancie to take roote, and which all may see now to florish, with an vndoubted hope of their yeelding fruite hereafter: yet ordaine to smell so these, and when you come into a pestilent aire that might infect your sound minde: yet sauour to these SLIPS in which I trust you shal finde safety: And yf you take pleasure in them, I shal not only be occa∣sioned to endeuour my selfe to make a further viage for a more dayntier thing (then Flowers are) to pre∣sent you withall: but also haue good hope that you wil accept this my labour, for recompence of al that which you are vnrecompenced for, as knoweth god: who I beseeche geue vnto you a longe and a lucky lyfe with increase of all your vertuous studies.
