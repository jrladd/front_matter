RIGHT HONORABLE,
BEsides the scandall imposed vpon idle Discourses, there is euer a wanton errour depen∣ding of presumption in the choyce of some Patron: so that when other men had flat∣tered my owne easie ouer∣wrought conceit to be an ad∣uenturer in the troublesome sea of Opinion: I thought it most befitting to looke out for some handsome props of supportation, and so haue placed the Daughters in one circle with the Mother: Yea, such Daughters, and such a Mother, that mee thinkes you mooue to∣geather like faire Planets in conspicuous Orbes; from whose influence can proceed nothing, but sweete pre∣sages: So that hereby you cannot choose, but breath with her one spirit of happinesse; and I be cheared with strong assistance against any calumniation.

I pray you therefore pardon this intrusion, and ex∣amine my Character no further, then my confidence that so great Honour and Worth, will not dissent from their owne properties, and giue me leaue to wish your merit the Wishes of such heartes, as leape for ioy at the naming of louelinesse and Beautie: To both which, with all other excellencies in your Honourable lfe,
