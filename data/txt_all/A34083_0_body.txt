THis following Case being drawn up, and Printed by some of the Agents and Soli∣citors
of the Creditors of Sir William Courten and Sir Paul Pyndar, for satis∣faction
of several Persons that were earnest to have it Published; and Commu∣nicated
to all the late Members of both Houses of Parliament; I obstructed the
progress thereof, being resolved that it should not go so nakedly into the world without any
Title or Dedication, and then only to the view of such Persons as are principally Interessed
and Concerned therein; I am obliged to let Your Lordship and the rest of the Creditors know,
that I have been in my Quality, as Administrator and Assignee, both Active and Passive, at
home and abroad, ever since his Majesties Restauration, in the pursuit of such our Rights
and Properties, that cannot be Mortified or Extinguished, except Mankind be Exterminated.
There are Volumes of Examinations and Depositions by me, taken from the Servants, Of∣ficers,
Factors and Sea-men, imployed by Sir William Courten, in Discovering, Planting,
and Fortifying the Island of Barbadoes; manifesting to all the World, that he was the Origi∣nal
Proprietor of that Island, and so Confirmed to him and his Heirs, by Letters Patents,
under the great Seal of England, in the third year of King Charles the first: Yet no Restitu∣tion
or Reparation could be obtained to this day, for the forceable Entries and Intrusions
made by James late Earl of Carlisle, and his Complices upon Sir William Courten in the
said Island.
There are as many more Volumes of Examinations, Depositions, Memorials, Answers,
Replications, Rejoynders, and other proceedings in several Languages by me, in the case of
the East-India Spoyls and Depredations upon Courten and Pyndar, before the values of the
Loss and Damages were reduced to a certainty, by Letters Patents under the great Seal of
England; which vested the Interest with an Authority irrevokable in the Grantees for reco∣very
thereof, according to the Rules of Law and Common Right; Yet no Restitution or Com∣pensation
can be obtained for the same.
There are little less Volumes of Proceedings upon the Civil Actions, depending in Holland
and Zealand, against the Heirs and Executors of Sir James Cats, Jacob Pergens, and
Peter Boudaen, for Monies lent upon Bonds, and Accompts standing out in Trade. Yet all
have terminated in contempts of the Law and positive Denialls of Iustice, in this Age of in∣gratitude
and forgetfulness.
Your Grandfather, John Earl of Shrewsbury, having lent the Sum of five and twenty
hundred pounds to Sir William Courten, towards his first Expedition into the East-Indies,
China, and Japan, upon whose foundation the present great East-India Trade is erected. Af∣ter
the Death of Sir William; William Courten his Son and Heir, together with Sir Ed∣ward
Littleton and others, entred into new Security in the year 1639 for the same Debt (be∣ing

all the ready Money then in your Family.) Whereupon Francis Earl of Shrewsbury, your
Father, with divers other great Sufferers (Creditors of Sir William Courten, and his Son,
as also of Sir Paul Pyndar) applied themselves in company with me upon the Kings most
happy Restauration, for some seasonable relief against the Hollanders and Zealanders, that
had lived upon the spoyls of all Nations.
His Majesty being then upon a Treaty of Common Alliance with the States General:
After eight months debate in Courtens affair, came to this Stipulation in the year 1662.
That upon restitution of the Island of olleron, and satisfaction to be made for the Spoyls and
Depredations concerning the two Ships named the Bona Esperanza and Henry Bona Adven∣tura;
All other Losses and Damages of his Subjects; and even that of Amboyna, should be
Mortified and Obliterated, that is to say, No Soveraign remedy should be given to any
of them by his Majesty, for the said Damages by Reprizalls; which was Mutually
Signed, and Solemnly Ratified accordingly.
This Stipulation was pursued by several Memorialls to the States General, for the space
of two years, at the Hague, and seconded by divers Orders from the Council Board, and
several Letters of Recomendation from his Maiesty, to the said States, under his Sign Ma∣nual,
which proving all innefectual. A Complaint thereof being brought before the House
of Commons, in the year 1664. was there Espoused with vast Royal Aides, towards the
Protection and Relief of the Complaynants: Therefore they are under great mistakes, both
in matters of Fact and Iudgment of Law, that Report the King was either Surprized or De∣ceived
in his Grant, or that the States General had not due Notice of Passing the Letters
Patents, for Restitution to be made to the said Francis Earl of Shrewsbury, and others
in the said Patent Mentioned and Expressed; being grounded upon several Acts of Parlia∣ment,
and the Ancient Law of Marque, and Reprizals: The Instances whereof, once
brought home to a Fiat under the great Seal of England, becomes a Decree unalterable, like
the Laws of the Medes and Persians
I beg Your Lordships Pardon and Patience, in craving Your Honours Serious Considerati∣on
upon the said Case; and the Creditors Proposals to his Majesty; with the Postscript after
them, in answer to the Lord Chancellors Arguments, on Friday the 26th. of May last,
when his Lordship gave Iudgment for the King, upon the Scire-Facias, concerning the said
Letters Patents, wherein Your Grandfathers Debt is included; yet further secured by
Collateral Covenants from my self, respectively to Your Honour and Sir Thomas Meres
for another Debt of 2000 l. Contracted in the year 1641, upon the obligation of William
Courten Esq; Sir Edward Littleton and Iohn Earl of Bridgewater, to Elizabeth Viscoun∣tess
Cambden, due to the said Sir Thomas Meres as Executor of Sir Erazmus de la Foun∣tain,
Executor of the said Viscountess; not doubting of Your Dilligence and Indeavours for
obtaining thereof, by all ways and means that are Honourable and Iust, more especially for
those Crying Debts due to many hundreds of Orphants and Widows, claiming under my Ad∣ministration,
(whose cause I shall never desert:) Yet constantly remaining
(SIR,)

Richmond August 2d. 1682.
