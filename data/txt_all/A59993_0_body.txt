May it please your Honour.
TO Pardon my Boldness in Presuming to shelter this Orphan under your Lordships Protection, I am not ignorant, having never as yet deserved any Favour from you, that it cannot but meet with a severe Construction, but wholly relying upon your Clemency▪ who have always been a favourer of the Muses▪ I flatter my self that your▪ Lordship may, for the Authors sake, vouchsafe to grant it a favourable acceptance. I will not slander it with my Praise, it is Commendation enough, to say the Author was Mr. Rivers. I am very well assur'd, after your perusal your Honour will esteem it one of the best Tragedies that this Age hath Produc'd. I humbly beg your Lordship to pardon this Presumption,
