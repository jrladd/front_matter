THIS Treatise of the Wonderful
Springs of Modena, publisht in
Latin by Bernard Rammazzini Physici∣an
of that Town, & Translated by me, tho
it has upon view had the approbation of
the most Knowing Mr. beside the most
Eminent Physicians of the Colledge, and
others, as the most admirable piece of Na∣tural
History that hath yet seen Day in
our English World▪ for therein are at once
discovered the changes that Nature hath

not made but in some thousand of years;
yet I thought it not adviseable for me to
expose this stranger, how ingenious, soever
to the publick view, and consequently cen∣sure,
without providing him a friend
before-hand; especially seeing he is to
appear against an Author, whose Repu∣tation
for Learning, and this his Hy∣pothesis
is so far establisht, that he
has already brought it to many Impres∣sions.
Among all that I have the honour
to be acquainted with, worthy Sir, I
thought I could not address my slf, to
a fitter Patron than your self. Whether
the Dignity of the Subject, or the Mo∣desty
and Ingenuity with which the Au∣thor
sets it out, be considered, this Trea∣tise
will merit your Approbation. Suf∣fer
therefore, worthy Sir, amidst the
Croud of your other more Important
Affairs, this Curious Searcher of
Nature, and Stranger, under your
Patrociny, to do that service to the
Lovers of Knowledge, that Sir Mat∣thew
Hales makes the Clock-Maker to
do to the Philosophers; for he supposes
that in a Country abounding with seve∣ral
Sects of Philosophers, yet unacquaint∣ed

ill then, with the noble Invention of
Watches and Clocks, a curiously contriv'd
Clock were exps'd to publick view, yet
so that they should have no access so look
into the inside of it, The Epicureans
would likely attribute it to the fortuitous
concourse of Atoms, the Prpateick
to the contemperation of the Four Ele∣ments
and the Cartesian to his three
Principles, every one according to the
Fancies he was prepossest with, but the
Clock-Maker, whom he supposes behind
the Curtain to hear all they say, steps out,
and by opening the Clock, shews how wide
they a all of the Truth, by letting them
see the Spring, and the contrivance of
the Wheels, on which the Motion of his
Engine depends, and that it was he who
made it. In the same Manner, Nature
her self, by the Pen of this Observing
Italian, seems modestly to give a check to
the presumption of her pretended Inter∣preters,
who will pass a Iudgment on her
most hidden Works, where they never
could pretend to make the least observa∣tion,
on which to found their Iudgment.
The respect the Author shews to Scripture
Authority, is the rather remarkable in

him, that he is a Roman Catholick,
who by us are charged with the contrary
Vice, which makes the fault of the Theo∣rist,
a professed Protestant, more black,
that is so bold in contradicting it, and
making it speak untruth to accommodate
it self to the capacity of the Vulgar,
which tho' some Pous Divines have al∣lowed
in passages of Scripture, where the
Phaenomena of Nature are spoken of by the
by, (which yet I prove to be a mistake in
the Confutation of the Theory) yet to
make the whole first chapter of Genesis,
wherein the Spirit of God does è com∣posito,
give an account of the Creation
false, is a piece of Presumption few have
been guilty of besides our Theorist.
As for the Confutation of the Theory,
tho' the performance may be short of what
the Subject requir'd, yet I hope the design
will please you, which is to vindicate the
truth of the Scriptures, for which I know
you have a great veneration, from the
false glosses and perversions of some that
seem to have studied Divinity, for no∣thing
else but to ridicule it, which they do
the more remarkably, that almost in the
same breath they pretend a great respect

to it, in which I endeavour to prove, that
the passages the Theorist cavils at, are to
be understood to speak according to the
Truth of the thing, and not according to
the false Opinion of the Ignorant vulgar.
If in this my small endeavour, I may find
your Patrocin, I shall not care for the dis∣pleasure
of these men of Ephesus, whose
made it is to make Shrines to this their
Diana of Hypothetical Philosophy, I mean
who in their Closets make Systems of the
World, prescribe Laws to Nature, with∣out
ever consulting her by Observation
and Experience, who (to use the Noble
Lord Verulams words) like the Spider,
with great labour, spin a curious Cob-web
out of their Brains, that is good fo no∣thing
but to be swept down, which tho' it
has a great shew of reason, in effect, has
no better right to that venerable Title,
than the Fancies of those who are said
to make Wind-mills in their Head. I
have given the whole Book the Title of
The Abyssinian Philosophy confuted,
because as the Preface is a confutation of
the Theory, so if you read Rammazzini
from page 88, at the end, to page 102.
you will find that the Theory is much the

same with the Abyssinian Philosophy, if
not taken from it, which being evident to
be a mere fiction, is ground enough for
the Title, and Confutan enough tho' I
should say no more. I shall not farther
incroach upon your time, but here make
an end, after I have subcribed my self,
Worthy Sir,
