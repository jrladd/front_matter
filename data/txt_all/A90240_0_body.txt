Right Worshipfull,
TAking into serious consideration, the depth of your Learning, the accutenesse of your witts, to get money by all trades, my thoughts were ravished, and I in a maze, when I saw, how you could make Laws, to serve God, to stuffe your gutts, to persecute your enemies, and pull Christ out of his Throne, at one and the same time; truly, I had not thought it had been in you, when I see how farre your Wisedome transcends the Papists, (who supposing (as well as you) that Hereticks should be whipped, first whip themselves) but you being Armed Cap a pied, with your Armour of folly, viz. self-confidence and rage, (which first armed your Predecessors to prose∣cute, when Persecution first began, by an Ass. of Divines, in the Laterane Pal∣lace in Rome) first make Hereticks of those, whose Tenents of Truth you cannot answere, and then Persecute them; O profound Wisedome, surpassing the wise∣dome of the Auncient; Besides, considering your extreame need, and want of necessaries, having but 24.
