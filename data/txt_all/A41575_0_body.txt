I Am in a strait in this mine attempt, in daring to dedi∣cate this small piece unto your Highness, the spirit of man standing alwayes in such readi∣ness (naturally) as a croking frog, in those Magicians of Egypt, to procure

the favour of, and gain interest in, the most publick and eminent men, only for private ends and self-respects.
But the simplicity and singleness of my proper intent is such in this designe, together with the freedome of my spi∣rit to prostrate my humble disires, (in publick view) after the prosperity of your Highness in eternal things, that I am born up, and incouraged here∣unto.
For God hath shewed me what all terrene and temporary affairs amount unto; yea, even of the greatest men, not being used to promote the honour of that one only, and eternally anointed.
For though a man may be but of a low stature, even as a shrub in his age, in the view and account of men, yet if he run well with Zacheus, and be take

himself to the top of the Sycomore tree, he may come to take a just and joyful view, of him who is Lord over all; though otherwise the press of such as are taller then he, may seem to hinder him from coming nearer; but if he know the way wherein the Lord passeth a∣long, he may take a direct and fruitful view of him, notwithstanding the crowd.
I know not but that God hath made your Highness the mirrour of this age, as a so exemplary for that to come, wherein the greatest glories of this world in the men thereof, may take a true view of their deformed faces, and that in the several feitures and figures thereof.
For I could never learn that you have pursued the honour thereof, but

only have been constrained through the urgency of a mighty hand of God pur∣suing your self, to yield your self over thereunto, when necessitie hath clothed you upon, and adorned you therewith.
Which is a thing rare to be found in this generation, or in any age, and therefore a myrrour, to be looked into, and admired with respect unto the best of men also.
No man can deny, but that God hath made you an instrument whereby to work wonderful changes, and that in high, though transitory affairs, making you a terrour to your enemies, and in a covert from the storm, un o such as pro∣fess friendship unto the cause of Christ.
I must confess, that the reports which I have heard, the things which I have seen, that have proceeded from

your own lips, as also what I have sen∣sibly felt, and tasted of (though in a remote corner of the earth) have so dissolved my heart to take the impressi∣ons thereof, that I cannot but perswade my self that your spirit profoundly looks into, and is in honourable and skilful motion, activity, and atchieve∣ments, in, and about that only weighty and great change, which concerns the life and death, humiliation, and raign of the Son of God; a change of state, carrying in it kingdom, power, and glo∣ry, infinitely transcending the rule and protection of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with the dominions thereto belonging.
For this hath in it reallity, of all kingdones, in their severall and vari∣ou distinctions of glory, and power; not

exempting one of all them which the common adversary the devil proposed unto Christ, but the wisdome whereby he presents them, would have falsified them unto Christ, in point of that whe e∣in the reallity of power and glory is properly terminated, and for ever stands, which being truly erected and rightly ordered, never departs from you; no more then the glory of the con∣quest and victory, together with his strength, wisdome, and skill to raigne, departs from the son of God, but abide upon him for ever.
I durst not presume this small piece to your Highness, which was bu briefly uttered according to our poore accu∣stomed indeavours in our dayly exer∣cise, without either Library, or time to make use of any such things, in this

rude, incumbring, and way-less wil∣derness.
But that I think it hath in it those two mites, which that poor widow cast into the treasury, which proved of more worth in Christs acceptation, then the offerings of Scribes, Pharises, and El∣ders, and all the wealthy of the world; for she gave out all her living, which consisted in two mites: the word mite is such a diminative, as that it pro∣cures, and gains, all increase; for she gives away the wealth and glory of her husband unto diminution, which is the riches and glory of the creature, in which tender, gift, or diminution, doth consist the Cross of Christ, in his death to all carnal and transient things, pro∣per to the life and law of the flesh.
And she throws in all the miseries

of mankind, which might arise, and grow, out of her widow-hood, and loss of all her former suppl es and excel∣lencies, in the loss and diminution whereof, the Son of God makes mani∣fest his own riches and power; and these are mites, or diminutives, yea, they are individuals, we cannot give part of either of them into the treasu∣ry, according to the nature of an ac∣ceptable offering, but we must give them all; for he hath all our glory humane, so, as to consume and diminish it upon the altar, and he hath all the miseries of man (thus offered) to diminish it also, in the bearing of it away, as up∣on the head of that scape-goat into the wilderness, or land of Shiner, to set it there upon its proper base.
Which twain, namely, temporary

ransient glory, and misery, are all that man lives upon, viz. upon his own bo∣dily or humane exercise, and doings, thinking thereby to obtain the favour of God; or else upon his own transient and humane sufferings, whereby he hopes to escape the displeasure of God: which twain make but one farthing, or quadril, that is, one state or condition of man, considered naturally and ori∣ginally, as springing from the earth, or that first Adam consisting thereof.
But being thus cast into the treasu∣ry, or storehouse of the Son of God, it is that one state and condition of Jesus Christ, in whose approbation we are re∣ceived (as that widow of threescore yeares of age or above) into that house and temple of God, out of which trea∣ry we find sufficiency and plenty to live

upon forever; whereas the rich give only out of their superfluity, for it is ever superfluous to add or lay out any of the glory & wealth of the creature, unto the riches and glory of the Son of God, which is the proper way of living to the men of the world, either to add something to the crown or cross of Christ, that is humaue and temporary, and whatsoever they give out in that manner, they still keep in the main stock of their own livelyhood in themselves, which living after the slesh is death, & such riches are a meer deprivation of all the holy things of God.
But a true widow neither owns the worlds miseries, nor yet its mercies, for she knows both the one & the other are cruelty, but only lives upon that stock in the treasury in the diminishing & demolishing of them both.

If these two mites were not here ten∣dred, in the true manner of the offering of them, as also the nature of the super∣fluous offerings of the rich (and that in such sort) as they are not found in the common records, pulpit, schools, elder∣ships, and great students of this age, I would hide my self in some corner of the temple, rather then make tender of them to publick view, much less to one of your atchievments, & give me leave humbly to profess, that I know the principles upon wch the common priesthood of this age stands, to be inconsistant to the true intent & scope of these following lines; & in point of a matter of no less weight then of life & death eternal, & if any man, receiving his ministry from the degrees in schools, laying on of hands by the presbitery or eldership, as commonly

and practised in these dayes, or such as are appointed to examine, correct, and reform, insufficient ministries; if any such will undertake to answer for themselves, by giving a punctual and plain account of their doctrine, accord∣ing to the true intent and scope of this small Epistle, in any, or in all the par∣ticulars contained therein, not striving about words, but look to the truth of the matter; they shall (if God spare life) be as faithfully answered, with profes∣sion made, what is thought of their ar∣guments, and upon what grounds, as this is faithfully, and loyally, out of an affectionated heart presented to your Highness.
And that to the intent that in case a carnal Counsel, Synod, or Eldership, should pass some unjust censure upon it,

branding it with errour, when men now awake, may be fallen asleep, there might be a remonstrance found to de∣clare the nature of their act; for it is an easie thing for such to condemn, as errours, such things as come not within the compass of carnal capacity, or else stands in there light to hinder their at∣taining to the glory of this world.
And as for Logical argument, height of style, Elegant, and Rhetori∣cal expressions; as we have little of them, so we matter them not much, but only keep to that real truth and sub∣stance, which will abide in us for ever; yet do we not deny unto any thing, its proper excellency▪ or eminency, in whatsoever it excelleth: Therefore we can freely give all relations a∣mongst men, their proper terms and

titles, afford them their proper places and offices, if conducing unto, and tol∣lerable in humane societies, as well as we can afford the Sun, Moon, and Stars in the firmament, their names, places, offices, or that conjugall tie be∣twixt man and wife, for the propaga∣tion of mankind on the earth.
Else we should go about to race out that, which the almighty hath stamped upon the creature, as a document, to fi∣gure out, and point unto eternal things in Christ, and so lay mans spirit wast of any capacity, to gather up the mind and intents of one another, whereby we should become barbarous each to other, debarred and shut out, from the use of communion, in that way of rationalli∣ty, wherein properly man excels all o∣ther creatures.

For how should we know, or to what should we have recourse, in the divers and variety of distinctions appertain∣ing to the kingdome of God, to make them speakable one to another, if not to the several distinctions which God hath set among the creatures, unto which he elegantly aludes in the ex∣pressing and revealing of himself, as in way of family, by father and son, in way of order, by city and field; and in way of rule and authority, by Prince and people: if we should not main∣tain such names, terms, and titles, how should the figure or letter of the word be preserved in the world, which proves as true a snare, through the wisdome of the serpent, to catch men in, unto de∣struction, as the temptations of Satan have an issue and way of escape given

unto them in the Saints, by that wis∣dome of God, whereby they prove as inlets into the kingdome.
The Scriptures deny not a souldier his titles, only let him put no man in fear, nor accuse any falsly, and be con∣tent with their allowance, in all their prosecutions, using their place aright. And with like cautions, all places, and titles, may be used, which are tol∣lerable and useful in humane societies; even by the Saints and people of God, for all things are lawful, though not in every person at all times expedient; neither are we to be brought under the power of any thing that is transitory and humane.
The most profitable use that I know, of all things visible to humane under∣standing, is to take them all as proper

figures (as the phrase of the Apostle is) whereby we cast up an account of substantial, material, and eternal things, and according as we are posses∣sed of the durable treasure, so the fi∣gure looseth its natural use and virtue, (which otherwise it inclineth and serveth unto) canselling it self in the very act of casting up the just and per∣fect summ; therefore we are to use the world as though we used it not, both with respect to the diversity, and also the universality thereof, because the figure of it passeth away.
Those renowned Christian expres∣sions, pathetical, and plain, in edicts come from your mouth, have rejoiced my heart, unto Immaduêre Lachry∣mis genae; and have imboldned me thus far, wherein I am prostrate as an

unworthy servant to your highness, in whatsoever is consonant to a Chri∣stian course.

From Warwick in the Naniganset Bay, this present October the 20. 1656. New England.
