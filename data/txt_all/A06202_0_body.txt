FArre fet, deare bought, doth fit a Lady best;
Such you deserue, such would my will bestow:
Good things are rare, rare things esteem'd you know;
Rare should yours be, as you rare of the rest:
Such hold this gift, fetcht from a forraine land,
Which wisest King, as pretious did prouide,
Who viewing all the earth, hath nought espide,
Whose worth (herewith coÌ„par'd) may longer stand:
The price (I dare assure) is very deare,
As puchasd by your merit and my care,
Whose trauell would a better gift prepare,
If any better worthy might appeare:
Then this accept, as I the same intend,
Which dutie to the dead would will me send.
