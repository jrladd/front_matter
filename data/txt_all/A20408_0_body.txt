THough in the spring-time of cur liues yeare, there bee no depth nor durance of resolution, because sound iudgemēt our reasons ripenes, is then but in the budde; yet the affection which I beare you, wherto your owne hopefulll forwardnesse did first giue life, and your many courtesies adde strength, albeit it were the childe of my childhood, conceiued where we both recei∣ued the first grounds of learning, was euen then so deepely rooted, that neither length of time, distance of plase, nor discontents of minde, haue beene able, I will not say to abo∣lish, but to diminish it: for an instance whereof, I haue en∣tituled to your name this naked humor, a Present not so wor∣thy as I would, or as perhaps I could affoord if some clouds were cleared: Yet howsoeuer this toy may prooue, I pre∣sume, of your acceptance, both in regard of that affection that (I hope) you still de beare me, which may impetrate a toleration whre no liking may bee looked for: or of that well-meaning wherewith I offer it vnto you, sith strangers

of strangers, and greatest Princes of meanest peasants haue taken in good worth as worthlesse things, because presented with good will. And I would that I might but halfe so fare pruaile with others, of whome some (I seare) will not onely charge me with that which iustly they may, but also aster te eading of my title and Proemium, deeme me one of those against whome Horace doth well exclaime, Oimi∣tatores servum pecus, yet I protest that neuer anything was further from my thoughts, and that the rest was fini∣shed before that humor was suggested But I should grossely offend in troubling you with a long Epistle, whome I trouble with so long a toy. I will therefore conclude with this condi∣tionall promise, wherein I ioyne with you the courteous Rea∣der, whose patience I vrge too much with my youthes fol∣lies, that if my life be capable of riper yeeres, and my state of better fortune, my labours shall not be wholly barren of deset: till when, and euer I rest,
