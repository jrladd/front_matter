Worthy Sir,
HAving rendred
this short Dis∣course
of Polyga∣my
into English,
I could not devise
to whom, I might

more fitly Dedicate
the same, than to
your ingenious and
free-spirited Self;
and in and by You,
to all other Gentle∣men
of like Noble
and manly temper,
so much (and that
deservedly) magni∣fied
byIn his Book of Wisdom. Charron,
as a principal accom∣plishment
of that
Wise-man, whom
he so excellently

describes. For in∣deed,
this Treatise
requires such Rea∣ders.
As for Pae∣dantic
and vulgar
Spirits, I warne
them to stand a loof,
lest they breake
their shins upon it,
make sowre faces,
and hail upon the
Authour a thou∣sand
Censures and
Reproaches, part of
whose burthen, I

am like to bear, for
teaching him to
speak English. Yet
the Discourse it
self, asserts nothing,
positively deter∣mines
nothing; on∣ly,
the chief and
most considerable,
if not all, the Texts
of holy Scripture,
and Arguments
from Reason, and
the Lawes and Cu∣stomes
of Nations,

that have been, or
can be brought for,
or against Polyga∣my,
are urged and
Answered inter∣changeably,
by the
two Persons of the
Dialogue; and the
Authour being one,
is a stiffe Pleader
for Monogamy,
& fighter against
Polygamy. The
Point it self is left
free and undeter∣mined,

to the un∣derstanding
& con∣science
of the seri∣ous
and judicious
Reader: And there∣fore,
I know not
why any discreet
person, (what ever
he thinks of the
Point) should find
himself offended at
this Discourse:
But that, as it
was publickly prin∣ted,
and vended

at Basil, a renow∣ned
Protestant Ci∣ty,
in Switzerland,
in the year 1563. so
it may in our famous
London, without
offence to a judici∣ous
Reader: And
the blessing of God,
Almighty and only
Wise, go along with
it, Amen.
