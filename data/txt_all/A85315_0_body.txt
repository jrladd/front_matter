SIR,
I Should be very ungratefull, now this Sermon comes to be read, if I should forget you, without whose assistance it had scarce been
Twice I was interru∣pted, as I was preach∣ing. heard. I wished much for your presence, though I did not request it: but what I feared your self apprehended, and seasonably coming in, stopped those mouthes by your Civill power, which neither reason, nor the so∣lemnity of the Ordinance would have si∣lenced:
had you been an Anabaptist, an enemy to the Ministery and Learning (as some have unjustly reported) you might have spared this care: if this act will not clear you, let my pen answer for you; (for I think no Minister hath more inward acquaintance with you than my selfe) I never heard him so much as question his own Baptisme, but I have heard him dis∣approve of persons for being Re-baptized, and two of his Children my selfe have baptized; how then is he an Anabaptist: When a Minister was nominated to suc∣ceed his deceased Pastor, because it was told him, that he was a Minister that would ad∣mit Tradesmen into his Pulpit, he told me he should never come there; and for Lear∣ning, such an enemy he is unto it, that I have heard him say, Take away Learn∣ing, and England becomes a dunghill: This I am sure, be a Minister Classicall, or Congregationall, so he be learned, able,
and godly, holding to the old sound Divi∣nity, he makes no difference, but can em∣brace both, beteaming them not onely a∣maintenance, but an honourable mainte∣nance. How then men will prove their re∣ports, I know not, unlesse thus, He is a Souldier; Ergo: but it is easily answered, Non sequitur, unlesse this Proposition be true, All Souldiers are Anabaptists and enemies to the Ministery, &c. which I am sure is false of some, though true of too many. Goe on then, good Sir, let not these reports trouble you (though I know they have done) God will in time clear up your innocency more by your actions than by my pen, and give his Church as much cause to blesse him for your faithfulnesse to it, as the Common-wealth hath cause to blesse him, for the unbyassed integrity, and painfull di∣ligence, which you have manifested in the execution of your Office as related to it: What I have here presented to you I pray
accept, as a testimony of that honourable respect I beare unto you, subscribing my selfe,
Feb. 28. 1655.
