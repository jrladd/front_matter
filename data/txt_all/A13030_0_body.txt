BECAVSE, bothe by the vni∣uersall reporte of all men, I heare, and also by myne owne experience I perfectly know (right honourable and my very good lorde) how hono∣rably and cherefully diuers workes presented to your lordship, haue ben accepted: I (though of al others most simple) was thereby encouraged, to offer to your honour this my simple worke, in token of my bounden duty. The exaumple also of that famous

Monarche Artaxerxes, who so wel accepted the simple handfull of wa∣ter, that the poore Persian Sinetas brought him from the riuer Cyrus, putteth me in good hope, that youre honour who geue place to no man in humanitie and curtesie wil not mis∣like this simple signifieng of my good wylle. For, like as the mite of that poore widowe that is mencioned in the Gospell, whiche she gaue in all her penurie, is accompted a greater gifte, then those huge sommes that great men layde out of their greate stoare: so ought this my simple pam∣phlet be adiudged to procede, though not from greater, yet from as great good will, as the best and learnedst writers beare to your honour. For, they, of their abundant stoare, haue laied oute somewhat: But I, of my

meane knowledge, haue presented these few first frutes to your honor: knowing that your wisedome can in this small present right well see my good wyll. My gifte is a short briefe or summarie of the chiefest chances and accidentes, that haue happened in this Realme, frome the tyme of Brutus, to this our age. VVhiche I haue done by the conference of ma∣ny authors, both old and new, those Imeane, that commonly are called Chroniclers, out of whom I haue ga¦thered many notable thinges, moste worthy of remembrance, whiche no man heretofore hath noted. whiche worke also I was the bolder to dedi∣cate to your honour, because I know your lordships good inclination to al sortes of good knowledges: and espe¦cially the great loue that you beare

to the olde Recordes of dedes doone by famous and noble worthies whi∣che my boldnes, like as I truste your honour wil not only pardon, but also accept in good part: so I besech al the readers hereof, that folowyng your honourable exāple, they will iudge the best of this my trauaile, whiche I toke in hand, onely for the respect that I had to their profite. VVherby they shall both shew the goodnes of their owne natures, and also encou∣rage me willingly to go forwarde in this my enterprise. VVhich doubting not, but that I shall the rather ob∣taine of them, because of your lorde∣ships fauourable acceptance hereof, I wil now cesse any lōger to trouble your honor, beseching almightie god long to preserue you to the cōmodi∣tie of this our natiue countreie.
