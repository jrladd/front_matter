LOuing and be∣loued Brother, I doe nowe like some that haue an Orcharde ill neighbored, that gather their fruit before it is ripe, to preuent stealing. These fragments of my conceites were going to print To labour the staie of them had bin troublesome, and subiect to interpre∣tation; to let them passe had beene to aduēture the wrong they mought

receiue by vntrue Coppies, or by some garnishment, which it mought please any that should set them forth to bestow vpon them. Therefore I helde it best discreation to publish them my selfe as they passed long a∣goe from my pen, without any fur∣ther disgrace, then the weaknesse of the Author. And as I did euer hold, there mought be as great a vanitie in retiring and withdrawing mens con∣ceites (except they bee of some na∣ture) from the world, as in obtruding them: So in these particulars I haue played my selfe the Inquisitor, and find nothing to my vnderstanding in them contrarie or infectious to the state of Religion, or manners, but ra∣ther (as I suppose) medicinable. On∣ly I disliked now to put them out be∣cause they will bee like the late new halfe-pence, which though the Sil∣uer were good, yet the peeces were

small. But since they would not stay with their Master, but would needes trauaile abroade, I haue preferred them to you that are next my selfe, Dedicating them, such as they are, to our loue, in the depth whereof (I ssure you) I sometimes wish your in∣firmities translated vppon my selfe, that her Maiestie mought haue the seruice of so actiue and able a mind, & I mought be with excuse confined to these contemplations & Studies for which I am fittest, so commend I you to the preseruation of the diuine Ma∣iestie. From my Chamber at Graies Inne this 30. of Ianuarie. 1597.
