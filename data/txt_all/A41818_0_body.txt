Sir,
AFter you have with much expence, and greater pains, searched what the world hath worthy to enrich so ble a mind; you have given your  now happy Countrey (because you  return'd) an essay of what it is to ct from your Pen, by the Poem ecrated to the immortal name of  sacred Majesty. Sir, but that I ould not make you blush at your own , I could tell you, how that  seem to have been design'd for  exercise of your Pen, as the fittest  the best of that sex, which mmand the whole world. Thus that tertainment of Queen Christina of den at Rome had lost its best so∣lemnity,



had not she been famous by the large, but excellent Poem of yours, which so earnestly the learned world expects, and by me begs, that you would not deprive that work, and the world together of the light. But Si, since you are the Ocean whence Wit springs, justly you may expect that other Wits should pay their tribute in thankfull rivulets to your greatesse. To you therefore these Poems run as your due: but, were they not of themselves things of worth, your name prefixed had made them so. For there cannot want devotion to the building, where the frontispiece challenges so great a reverence, as all the world willingly pays to your name, but most particu∣larly
