SIR,
I Have found an old Manuscript, which being in mine opinion both judicious and true, I made bold to print and present to your Matie: which if with a quarter of an hours time onely you honor, in very few words you shall see the glorious life of the King your Father. This life Sir can be imitated by none but your Matie, and can be offered you by no more faithfull witnes of it then my selfe, who not dying under the Fathers commands, have no greater ambition then to end my life in the Sons service, and deserve by well serving to be regarâˆ£ded by your Matie
Sir,
