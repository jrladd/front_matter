RIght woorthie, and reuerend Father in God.
Blame not your ancient Obseruer, if nowe, after he hath recouered in a man∣ner, at Cambridge, that life, which he lost at his de∣parture from Oxford, he ri∣ses aniew, as it wear out of his ashes, to do his humble

seruice to your Lordship: and, indeede, to whome can any fruit that comes from him, bee with more right presented thē to him, in whose garden, and vnder whose shadow it griew? In∣to whose hand should this small booke, though wan∣ting his owne Epistle, be deliuered, but vnto that, to which it hath before giuen so many Epistles? whear can it looke for protection with more hope thē whear it hath formerly, with all fauour, founde it.
If your Lordship thear∣fore will be pleased to be the defender of this Apo∣logie, and to breath, as I

may truely say, the breath of life againe into his se∣quent Meditations, that so beeing annimated aniew with those vnspeakeable sighs, and alike feruent zeale of spirit, whearwith they wear first, as in fierie chariots, carried vp into heau'n; I doubt not but they will seeme, beeing so quickned, to any that shall reade them (especially if, as Iob wished in a case not much vnlike, his foule wear in his foules stead) no cold, or dull, or dead lettets: and in so doing, you shall not onely followe him into his graue, but call him out of it with this so speciall a be∣nefit,

binding with the dead in one knot of thank∣fulnesse all his Friends that yet liue, and cannot but ioy to see your Lordships fauour out-liue the person, on whom it is bestowed: of whome my selfe, being the least, shal euer thinke I am most bound to be.
