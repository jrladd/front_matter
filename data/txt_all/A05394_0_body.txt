MErcy, grace, and peace from God the father almyghty, vnto your honours, wyth my moste humble and re∣uerente comen∣dacions.
The enemye of God and man alwayes se kyng lyke a ro∣rynge lion whome he may deuoure, is much at al tymes, but then especially to betaken hede vnto, when as he hym self beyng trans∣formed into the aungell of lyght, doth cloke the ministers of hys myschiefe in a preten∣sed shew of godlines and vertue, so that ther by they be suffered of al men, and mayntei∣ned of many men, to worcke and brynge vn∣to passe a deuilli she dysorder, and shamefull dyshonestye in a Christen commen wealth.
Wherefore, seynge that in thys realme

preachers, officers, marchauntes, crafts mē, labourers, and such lyke, be displaced of their roumes, and dysapoynted of theyr lyuinges by those whych through a pretensed name, & outward apperance, seme to be necessary and profytable ministers in a common wealthe, (how beit in theyr owne doynges may be eui∣dently tryed and knowen for to be spylers and disturbers of any common welth) suredly you of the kynges most honourable counsell, beyng the chefe maiestrats and rulers in this realme, had nede to be ware, circumspect and diligent, lest that Sathan banyshyng al faith∣ful Christians, whych should and wold pro∣uyde to helpe one an other, do fyl this realme ful of crafty flatterers, whych can and wyll deceyue, begyle, and spoyle one another.
Truly ther be no men more against Christ then those which by profession of Christen re∣lygyon, and bearyng of a Christen name, doo rob Christ of hys honor, & Christes ministers of theyr liuyngs: nor none more parilous en∣nemies vnto the kings maiesty, and vnto this realme, thē those whyche haue the names of Englishmen, and the kyngs subiects wyth y• condicions & maners of enemies, & traitors.
Most gracious good lordes and maisters, for your reuerent loue towardes God, and

the kyng, for your charitable pytye of myse∣rable spoiled people, and for the necessary re∣garde of your owne honours, and the state of thys realme, se and consyder how that ambi∣cious couetous men, do bye and sel, take and abuse personages, prebendes, offyces, fees, marchaundyse, fermes, landes, and goodes, so that prowlyng for them selues, they be nei∣ther afrayde, nor ashamed to spoile thys real∣me of preachyng of Gods gospel, of iustyce and equitie, of cheape and plenty, and of eue∣ry thynge that should saue, kepe, or profytte a commune wealthe.
Wherfore most gracious good lordes, and maysters, for the tender mercies of God in our Sauiour Iesus Christ, take hede that neyther seruaunte, nor frende, reteyner, nor youreselues do deceyue you wyth flatterye.
For seynge that ambicious couetous men do take, kepe, and enioye the roumes and ly∣uynges of euerye mannes vocacion, bothe you and we be in farre more daunger, then yf blockehouses and bulwarkes made and kepte of the kynges faythful subiectes for the sauegarde of thys realme, were taken and abused of suche Scottes or Frenchemen, as makyng spoyle for theyr owne profit, would not spare to dystroye thys realme.

There is very manye rowmes and ly∣uynges, belongynge both vnto the ecclesia stical mynisterye, and also vnto cyuyll poli∣cye, in the whyche be no fayethful subiectes, godlye diligente ministers and offycers, whi che by doynge of theyr duties, doo saue, kepe and comforte the people: but couetous Ido∣latours, whych neglectyng theyr dutye, and takynge commodities, doo dysorder, spoyle and dystroye the people.
Suerly if there be any men that goo a∣boute to perswade the Kynges Magestye, or you of hys honourable Councell, that thin∣ges in thys realme for the mostparte be ho∣nourablye, godlye, or charytably reformed, they be but flaterers.
For papistry is not banyshed out of Eng∣lande by pure religion, but ouerrunne, sup∣pressed and kepte vnder within thys realme by couetous ambicion. Papistrye abused ma ny thyngs, couetousnes hath distroyed more: papistry is supersticion, couetousnes is Ido∣latry. Papistrye afore tyme dyd obscure the Kinges honour, and abuse the wealth of this realme, couetousnes at thys tyme doth more abuse and decaye theym bothe, makynge the kynge bare, the people poore, and the realme miserable.

The Kynges procedynges to be red in his lawes, statutes, and Iniuncions be good & godly: but to be sene and knowen in the dedes and practises of his officers, seruauntes, and subiectes, be vngodly, shameful, wicked. For in theyr doynges appeareth no reournynge from euil vnto good, by a godly reformaciō: but a procedyng from euyl vnto worse, by an vncharitable spoyle, & deuyllyshe destrucciō.
Landes ad goodes be spoyled: prouysy∣on made for learning and pouerty, is destroi∣ed. Ye knowe in whose handes thys ryche spoyle remaineth, then cā ye not be ignoraunt by whose meanes the wealth of this realme is spoyled and decayed.
If ye wyll haue a godlye reformacion  to procede, truste not the ser∣uauntes of Mammon, ennemyes vnto God, and traitoures vnto the kynge, and spoylers of the people, wyth the settyng forthe of your godlye lawes, statutes and ordynaunces, which be most contrary vnto theyr couetous myndes, and wycked dedes.
Theyr myndes are alwayes euyll, and theyr dedes be well knowen, when as you geu frelye, or suffer theym by brybrye to by vnto theim selues authorytye: for then, being trusted to make better prouision for the pore,

to erect mo Grammer schooles, to encrease & augment the vnpuersities, and to se the peo∣ple taught louyngly, to reuerence, serue, ad obey God, the kyng, and you: they take pro∣uisyon frome the poore, they sell awaye Grāmer scoles, they deci the vniuersities, and they vse suche practises, as maketh God to be vnknowen, the kynge dysobeyed, & you suspected, hated, and enuyed of the people.
Take these false flatterers whyche haue enryched them selues, makynge the kynge bare, and the people poore, restore theyr lan∣des and goodes vnto the kynge, theyr row∣mes and offyces vnto faythfull and true of∣fycers and ministers: and then shal the kyng be enryched, the realme vnspoyled, and the people delyuered from myserable captiuitie vnder cruel extorcioners, vnto an honest ly∣bertye vnder Godlye gouernoures, whyche shall so dyspose the hartes and myndes of all people, that they wyllynglye shall be readye, not onlye to serue the markettes wyth corne, but also to serue God and the kynge wyth landes and gooddes, bodyes and lyues, when and where so euer you shal commaunde it.
Maruel not thoughe a fayth ful hearte, wyth humble obedyence and reuerente loue

towardes the kynges Maiestye, and you of hys honourable Godly counsel, do barst ad poure foorthe a lamentable complaynte of greuous sorrowe conceyued in seeynge the king shamefully begyled, you sore dishonored, & the wealthe of thys realme vtterly spoyled.
For menne dooe hye offyces vnto them selues, and landes from the kynge: and by the onlye spoyle that is made in common of∣fyces and vpon the kynges landes, bothe these bargens be payed for, and furthermore all such bargeyners wonderfullye enryched.
O mercyfull Lorde, what a griefe is it vnto a faythfull harte, hauinge iust occasyon to suspecte, that you lacke faythful counsell to adueriyse you of the gracious workynge of the Lorde beynge God, and of the freyle fautes of youre selues beynge mene, in all youre doynges: for Gods grace woorkynge in you, causeth you to dooe honourable and Godlye seruyce to God, the kynge, and the common wealthe, when as ye cause an vngodly byshop to be deposed. And yet shall god, the king, and the people be greuously of∣fended, and your honors and sowles so a in∣daungered, yf a bishops landes or goodes be deuyded amongst you that be godlye magys∣rates to punysh euyl doers, as Christes cote

was deuyded amongest wycked soldyers, which dyd cruelly torment a righteous persō.
Alas most gracious reuerente Lordes and maysters, if ye vse the seruyse, or hear the ad∣uyse of false crafty flatterers, ye shall there∣wyth be so blynded that ye can neyther per∣ceyue by your selues, nor beleue when as ye be playnely and faythfully tolde, that manye of your owne doynges, commyng of mans freyltye, do tend muche vnto the displeasure of God, dyshonour of the kynge, and dyscre∣dyt of your selues, beyng moste contrarye to that reuerent zele and faythful loue towards God, the kyng, and the cōmen wealth, which zeleand loue god of hys goodnes hath graf∣fed in your hartes, and the deuyll by mannes freyl dedes couered in sylence or colored with prayse of flatterers, laboreth to deface, per∣uert and destroye.
As God whyche searcheth the secretes of mans hart, doth beare me recorde, I do sup∣pose, and thynke that you dooe so louyng lye drede God, reuerence the kyng, and regarde this realme, & your owne honors, that beyng charged wyth the ouersight and prouision of castels, holdes, and fortes, made and kept for the safegarde of thys realme, ye coulde not wyttyngly be hyred to sell one of them vnto

the kynges ennemyes, for al the treasures in the world. And yet beyng craftelye deceyued wyth attery, ye vse a daungerous practyse in very many of them.
Forther be some of them sclenderly assau∣ted at certayne tymes of feble enemyes: and other continuallye beseged eyther wyth open forse or craftye conueyaunce of fearce, cruel, and perylous enemies. And now crafty flat∣terers whych haue once serued for theyr wa∣ges in tyme and place of the sclender assalte, doo afterwardes requyre and perswade you for that seruyse to geue them the spoyle of o∣ther holdes remayning continuallye in more daunger Truly Frenchmen and Scottes be but feble ennemyes, and at certayne tymes do sclenderly assalt castels, towers, and such maner of holdes: The deuyl seking lyke a ro ryng Lyon, whom he may deuoure, nyghte & day, wynter and sommer, wyth a wonderful forse of wycked spirites, doth euer besyege by shopryckes, shyres, townes, and parishes.
Yf these places be not wel furnished with stout and true soldiers of bothe the sortes (I meane both officers in ciuyle polycy, and al∣so Prelates in Ecclesiasticall ministery) or if those souldyers be vnprouided of necessary liuyngs and dewe wages, then must the peo∣ple

nedes peryshe and be destroyed for theyr owne synnes, and the bloud of theyr bodyes and soules requyred at your handes, whyche be charged and trusted of both God, and the king to prouide souldiers to those places, and also wages and liuinges to mayntayne those soldyers continually.
How be it now manye personages, bene∣fyces, offyces, and fees be sold vnto couetous brybers for money, whych seke nothyng but the vantage of extorcion, robbry and spoyle, and fewe of them be freely giuen vnto faith∣ful ministers & officers for their woorthynes, whych could and would by diligent doynge of their dutie, gouerne, instruct and cheryshe goddes people, the kynges subiectes.
And therefore nowe the most part of men lackyng teachers & rulers, do without griefe of conscience, or feare of punishment, abuse e∣uery thynge vnto the ruine and destruccion, whyche God hath ordayned vnto the vphol∣dyng & increase of a christiā commune welth.
As for example, now bying and sellyng is not vsed as a prouision for good cheape and great plenty, but made the most occasyon of dearth and scarsitie. Wealth and wyt be not ryghtly vsed vnto a common confortable pro fyt, but shamefully abused vnto a wycked pri

uate gayne. Many offyces with authoritie be not duely disposed vnto faithful worthy men nor to dooe good vnto other, but vnlawfullye bought and solde amongest couetous, ambi∣cious men, to get gaynes vnto theim selues. So this realme is spoyled, the kynge is made bare, & his faithful true subiectes be many of thē very poore: but crafti deceiuers, couetous Extorcioners, brybynge offycers, and suche false flatterers be wonderous rich & welthy.
These Flatterers be wonders perilous fe∣lowes, hauynge two faces vnder one hoode. For they beare a face and shew towardes the people, as though by Commyssion and com∣maundement from you, there must bee more required and taken of the people th euer you dyd meane or thynke: And towardes you thei shewe another face semyg that so much can not be founde in anye mennes hādes as must needes bee procured: but that therefore the kynges landes must nedes be solde, whyche thei are redye to by for their owne auatage, wyth those goodes whyche they them selues haue in theyr owne handes, or rather wyth the spoyle whych they intend to make vpon those landes. These subiects that be not asha∣med to procure vnto them selues such riches, that they maye be biers, and vnto theyr leige

Lorde and kyng suche nede, that he muste be a seller of his landes. These be in deede seruaū∣tes vnto Mammo, enemies vnto god, trai∣tores vnto the king, and disturbers of a com∣mon welth turning all your godly, wise, and charitable deuyces for ecessary prouysyon, vnto douylish deceytes, for to cause & mayn∣teyne vncharitable spoyles. And suredly whē as occasions do serue for any men to practise theyr pleasures, manye men of al sortes, and of the lowest sort, the most part do shew them selues the worst infected wyth thys▪ imyety, treason, and rebellyon, the greuousnes and daunger of the whyche wyth occasyons and meanes how to auoyd the same, I preaching at Paules Crosse the. xiiii. day of December last past, dyd there openly declare vnto mine audience. And as I did then preach that Ser∣mon as an exhortacion to▪ moe the people, by the acknowledgyng, lamentyng and amē∣dynge theyr owne fautes, to dese and re∣ceyue the pardon of mercy offered vnto them of both god and the kyng, in thys longe paci∣ent sufferaunce, so do I nowe here offer vnto your honors, that same Sermō as an earnest complaynte, to procure of you that be Gods offycers, spedyly correccion for them that re∣fuse to heare, regarde, and obey Gods word.

Be not dyscouraged in thys matter, wyth your owne freylty beyng greate, or wyth the number of offenders, beyng manye. For it is not your worthynes, but Goddes grace, that hath placed you in hygh authority, and in the same aucthoritye not your owne powers and polcy, but the myght and wisdome of God, al so strengthen and confyrme you, thatyf ye wyll be dyltgent, ye shall be made able to delyuer Gods people, the kynges subiectes, oue of the haudes of suche as be Gods and the kynges en nemyes.
I beseche the almyghtye God indue you wyth grace, that begyunyng wythyoure sel∣ues, ye may spedely procede vnto the necessa∣ry, and godly correccion of other mens fau∣tes, so that ye maye be establyshed in youre rowmes, and increased in honor, to serue god & the kynge, prouiding for hys real me in ho∣lines & righteousnes al  daies of yourlyues.
