IT is my Honour (Gentlemen) that I serv'd a double Apprentiship within your Walls; and however I have for many years discontinu'd, it is not possible, that any Man bred in a Society of so much Learning and Air, should have alto∣gether forgotten, what he once imbib'd.
The Loyalty of your House, (excepting some single Person here and there) was in the worst of times exemplary; Nor were Ye last, in bring∣ing the King back again to His: And because the Dispensing Power best secures Him in it, and the Kingdom under it, unto whom more justly could I make a Proof of it, than to that Honora∣ble Body, from whom I receiv'd it?

Such (Gentlemen) is the Discourse I herewith present Ye; and in that, being now, no longer mine, but Yours, as none are more able, be also as pleas'd to defend it: Or so kind (at least) to say this of Your old Acquaintance: That he spoke his Thoughts; That he believ'd them true; And on that account, would not willingly quit them, till he be better inform'd.
Gentlemen,
