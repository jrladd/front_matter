Most accomplisht LADY,
THe many singular favours, which I have received, not onely from your worthy self, but also from your thrice noble progenitors, justly oblige me by all the due tyes of gratitude, to tender a just acknowledgement: I wish the same heart, that for many and just causes truely honours you, had any present worthy your acceptance. Now shall it be your singular good∣nesse to patronage this small Trea∣tise, which (if I mistake not) car∣ries with it two parts, Delight,

and Utility. I doubt not then, but that it will find a generall ac∣ceptance among all those, who are any way the least lovers of such plea∣sing and all delightfull studies. I intend not to paraphrase upon its worth, its use, and singular profit, which abundantly speaks it second unto none that hath been publish∣ed of the like nature: so hoping you will accordingly esteem f it, I beg pardon for my boldnesse, and rest ever,
