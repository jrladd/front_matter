Madam,
I Am sensible, that it is a great presumption in me, being an Obscure Person, and altogether unknown to your Honour, to prefix that illustrious Name of yours to this mean undertaking which has been already celebrated to the World, in the workes of your Honourable Brother, whose learned Pen, can give an immortality to any thing it men∣tions. But to render my attempt herein, if not warrant∣able, yet the more excusable; I must say that my chief de∣signe herein, was an Essay of gratitude towards your Ho∣nour, as a poor acknowledgment of your favours, towards some, the nearness of whose relation to me, hath reflected a great part of the Obligation, upon my self, and rendred me your Debtor. And under this Character, I am bold to offer these fancies to your Honours Patronage, as a Testimo∣ny to the World, of that real esteem and reverence the Au∣thor of them bears to your admired vertues. The following lines were the unripe fruits of a youthfull fancy, and the divertisements of idle houres. They are innocent and harm∣less, And that's the best I will say of them. Recommending them to your Honours gracious acceptance from
Madam,
