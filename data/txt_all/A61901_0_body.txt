Right Honourable,
THE unexpected Success this plain Discourse (by the Blessing of God) met with from a kind Auditory in this City, (for whose private Benefit 'twas, not long since, I must con∣fess, but too hastily drawn up;) as it prompted me at first to offer it before the most publick Assembly therein at Guild-Hall-Chapel;
so the Hopes of its farther Ʋsefulness makes me now readily comply with Your Honour's Commands for its Publication, in order thereunto. That it may have its design'd Effect, in contribu∣ting (though never so little) to the Re∣trieving so Ancient, so Ʋniversal, so Religious, I may say, so necessary a Practice, as is the subject Matter of it; and, by Consequence, to the farther Pro∣moting of God's Glory, in the greater Good of his Church in general, and the Welfare of particular Christians, is the Hearty Desire of,
Right Honourable, Your most Humble, Most Obedient Servant,
