Gentlemen,
IT is the general Opinion of the World, That you desired your Master to publish the Sermon which he preached before you on the 29th of May, that the Doctrine he delivered in it might come to publick Trial, and excite some among our selves to give it a publick Refutation. Having little to do this long Va∣cation, I thought it would help away the time to write my own Re∣flexions upon it in form of an Answer; and such as it is I humbly present it to you, desiring no other Favour from you, than that you would please to read it over, if it scape the Inquisitors of the Press, and happen to get abroad. Your Study and Profession is the Law, and it is the Defence of Law, and of Justice, which is founded on Law, that I have undertaken against the Doctor, of whom in the following Discourse I have here and there given some Account, as well as of his Principles, that the World may judge of both.Ld. Chancellor Ellesmere in his Speech touch∣ing the Postha∣ti, p. 33. A great and eminent Lawyer divides the Law of England into Three Parts; the First of which respects the Church, and it is called, Lex Ecclesiae; the Second respects the Crown, and is called, Lex Coronae; the Third respects the Subjects in Common, and it is called, Lex Terrae: And if Providential Possession, according to your Master's Doctrine, can supersede the second part of the Law, and contrary to it give an Usurper a Divine Right to the Crown, and all the Possessions, Authority, and Prerogatives that belong unto it; then I do not see but it must in like manner supersede the other two parts also; and by consequence give a Divine Right to the Church of Eng∣land,
 if he can recover Possession of it; and the King himself a Divine Right to the Estates, and other Rights of the People, if he can get Possession of them. I believe it will not please the Reverend Doctor to see his Doctrine improved into these Consequen∣ces; not only because they are displeasing to others, but ungrateful to himself, who hath a very tender regard to his own Rights, both as a Church-man and a Subject, though he make so light of those of the Crown. But, Gentlemen, I am not here to dispute against him, but by the Dedication of the following Treatise to testifie to the World the great Zeal I have for Law and Justice, and the great Esteem I have for you, as Professors of the one, and Patrons of the other; and that I am upon both Accounts,
Gentlemen,
