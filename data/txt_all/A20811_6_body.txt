FAire and vertuous Mistres, since first it was my good for∣tune
to be a witnes of the many rare perfections wherewith
nature and education aue adorned you, I haue been forced
since that time to attribute more admiration to your sexe,
then euer Petrarch could before perswade mee to by the prayses
of his Laura. Sweet is the Frch tongue, more sweet the Italian,
but most sweet are they both if spoken by your admired selfe. If
poesie were praiselesse, your vertues alone were a subiect suffici∣ent
to make it esteemed, though among the barbarous Getes: by
how much the more your tender yeres giue scarcely warrant for
your more then woman-like wisedome, by so much is your iudg∣ment
and reading the more to be wondred at. The Graces shall
haue one more Sister by your selfe, and England to herselfe shall
adde one Muse more to the Muses. I rest the humble deuoted
seruaunt, to my deere and modest Mistresse, to whom I wish the
happiest fortunes I can deuise.
