Memoriae SACRÆ²M.
To the Eternal Honour OF THE One and Onely Mediatour betwixt God and Men, The MAN CHRIST JESUS, His blessed SAVIOUR and REDEEMER:
J. B. The unworthiest of his Redeemed Ones, in Testimony of his unfained Gratitude for so unestimable a Favour, Humbly Dedicateth these His WEAK, & (so far as they are his) WORTHLESSE MEDITATIONS.
