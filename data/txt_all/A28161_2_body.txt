Worshipful,


WOnder you may, that I who am unknown
To any of you, should presume to send
So small a present (as I scarce dare own)
To all of you, whose Deeds your Worth commend.
But having found you generously free,
This (I confess) humbly emboldned me.



True; I was one of Levi's turn'd-out Tribe,
Who never durst against my conscience sin,
Nor claw Church-livings with an unjust bribe,
And stoutly swear I honestly came in;
Your Presentations are not bought nor sold
With eye-bewitching heart-corrupting gold.



If in the place whereto I have a call
From God and you, I any good may do,
As a weak Instrument, I trust I shall,
Ascribe it wholly unto God and you.
Heav'n crown you all, with all (excepting none)
The blessings of the Foot-stool and the Throne.
Which is the unfeigned desire of

(Most Noble Patrons)

Awre, March 25. 1667.
