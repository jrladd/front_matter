Right Honourable,
TImes of trouble have ever been times of triall, they are sifting times; wherein God sifts us, as he tells us, Amos 9.9. and men sift us; But with a great deale of differ∣rence, God to preserve the flowre, Men to discover the bran; the obiect of Gods triall is our graces, of mans our corrupti∣ons; that which God aymes at is to evi∣dence our good, that which men, to disco∣ver our evill; your Honour hath passed Gods triall, who tries the heart, and the good he hath discovered, hath rendered you truly honourable: And you have suffered
mans, I say suffered, and to say no more, have endured the temptation. And in∣deed your Honour hath been a rock in greater stormes, and acquitted your selfe in greater trials then these are; what are the trials of these times to the siftings of former yeares? Then the trials were more close, Religion being more ab∣stracted from other considerations; now more grosse being complicated with other respects; then few would appeare for Religion, though now many stand up to assert it; then it was under contempt, now it honours them, who honour it. We reade while iudgements accompanied the Arke of God, while they who had it were smitten with Emrods, every one thought it a burthen, and were desirous to turne it off; they sent it from Gath, to Ekron, from Ekron to Askalon, and he was the happy man that could rid his hands of it; But afterwards when it came into the house of Obed-Edom, and they saw that God blessed him and his whole house for the Arks sake, then every one could looke upon it as worthy entertain∣ment. While Religion and the truths of God are dangerous and undoing to them
who own them, every one is shie to re∣ceive them, and as ready to reiect them; But when once the wayes of God come to be thriving, enriching and ennobling wayes, and that religion comes to be of common reception, and reputation, then every one is ready to give entertainment to it; It is something for a man to owne the Arke when none will own it; indeed many will own a prospering truth, a blessing Arke; but he is an Obed-Edom indeed, that will own a persecuted, a tos∣sed, banished Arke.
My Lord, you are this Obed-Edom, who have owned the Arke, when few would owne it, that have esteemed it a blessing, when have apprehended it a curse, that have looked upon it as your greatest honour when others have eyed it as their disgrace, that have sided with re∣ligion not when you might live on it, but when it was to live on you, and upon the best of your interests and emjoyments. None that knows your Honour, but knows this, that in the worst of times, when Re∣ligion was under most contempt, and it seemed crime enough to be godly, when your Honour was not onely a carefull
practiser, but a zealous promoter of the wayes of God, a faithfull contender for puritie of doctrine and worship, a shelter to the godly, a refuge to the oppressed, a fence to religion, and counted godlinesse great gaine, when there was (if we looke downward) no gaine to be made of god∣linesse. And for the publique they are strangers in our Israel, that doe not know your constant and unwearied labours and layings out for it: And before ever the publique was thought upon in publique, even as one, resolved to run that hazzard, either to live in the publique, or to die for the publique. And how God hath car∣ried on your spirit, and made you service∣able in these times of common calamity, not Epistles, but Chronicles, without suf∣spition of partialitie shall report to fu∣ture generations, when all clouds of mis∣take shall vanish, and nothing but impar∣tiall truth shall be revealed.
To you my honoured Lord, as to one who hath been so zealous an Assertor of liberties, this small Treatise of Christian Libertie flyes for protection, not that it feares injury, if innocency may secure it, but desires Patronage of them who are
worthy: It contains chiefly some friendly debates of some opinions, which have been maintained against the Law, where∣in I have so endeavoured to hold up the Law, as not to intrench upon the liber∣ties of Grace, and so to establish grace, as not to make void the Law, nor to discharge beleevers of any dutie they owe to God or man. And this discourse though weak, yet such as it is, I make bold to present to your Honour with your vertuous and no∣ble Lady, and should onely convey it in∣to your bosomes by prayer, did not my native Countrey and place to which your Honour is related,
Manchester. ingage me to adde a few words. A place it is which above many others God hath honoured both in strengthening them to doe their duty, and preserving them in it, making them not onely a Rock against their enemies, but a refuge for their friends, the releevers of many places in danger, and the recoverers of many lost; It is my earnest request to your Honour as bearing relation to them, that while they are in conflict, they may be eyed and relieved; And when it shall please God the storme is over, your Ho∣nour would looke upon that place, in help∣ing
to adde to the honour of your name upon it, some further name of honour to it; And the God of all grace and mercy be still a tower of protection to them, and a starre of direction to you, that you may know how to walke in wisdome under all the changes of his providence to you, and make your Honour yet further instru∣mentall, to advance his cause, and promote his glory, and when you have served him in your generation here, take you to his glory hereafter; which is the earnest and heartie prayer of him,
