Right Honourable,
WEre not your Wisdome and experience in the
great and weighty affaires of State so well
known, and were yee not so much accustomed
to the unjust complaints of clamorous persons▪
I might be discouraged to appeare in the righ∣teous
cause of the United Colonies of New-England,
and more especially in the behalf of the Governour
and Company of the Massachusets, to render a reason of
their just and righteous proceedings against Samuel Gorton
and his Companions, who however (where they are unknown)
they goe here under the garbe of a peaceable people; yet if your
Honours, and the rest f the Honourable Committee shall be
pleased (when more weighty employments shall give way) to pe∣ruse
our just defence against his clamorous complaints, and
scandalous Treatise, called, Simplicities defence against

Seven-headed Policy, &c. I make no question but yee will re∣ceive
full satisfaction in what we have done, and be ready to
justifie our proceedings against them as godly and righteous.
The reason wherefore I am forced to appeare in Print before
I give a particular answer to your Honous, and the rest of the
Honourable Committee, is, because I find a more grosse deforma∣tory
aspersion cast upon the Countrey to the publick view of our
Nation: which as it is deare in our eyes (witnesse our frequent
publick solemn dayes of prayer to the Throne of grace for it, to∣gether
with our private supplications, which the Searcher of the
heart best knows, sympathizing with it in every condition, to
the losse of Ships, Goods, &c. to the great weakening of our
estates) so wee desire to remove whatsoever may sadden the
thoughts of our Nation against us; especially your Honours, and
all that are godly in Christ Jesus.
What greater wrong can bee done a poore persecuted people
that went into the wildernesse to avoid the tyrannicall Govern∣ment
of the late Hierarchy, and to enjoy the Liberties Christ
Jesus hath left unto his Churches (which these blasphemous
Adversaries of ours, so much sleight and cast off) then to be ac∣counted
persecutors of Christ in his Saints, yea, to go thither
to that end, to become outragiously cruell, barbarously in∣humane,
uniting together to suck the blood of our Coun∣try-men,
&c. And yet Right Honorable, it will and doth appear
in the following Treatise, that Samuel Gorton was prosecu∣ted
against, First, at Plymouth as a grosse disturber of
the Civill peace and quiet of that Government, in an open
factious and seditious manner. Secondly, hee was no lesse
troublesome, but much more at Roade Island, having gotten
a strong party to adhere unto him, affronting that Govern∣ment
(as Plymouth) in their publique administration of
Justice so foully and grossely, as mine eares never heard
the like of any; to which Relation in the following Discourse I

referre your Honours, being compiled as briefly as may bee▪
Gorton being there whipt in his person, and thence banished
with some of his principall adherents, they went next to
Providence, where Mr. Williams, and some others have
built a small Towne. This people receiving them with all
humanity in a cold season, when the former places could no
longer beare his insolencies; hee soone undermined their Go∣vernment,
gained a strong party amongst them to his owne,
to the great distraction of Mr. Williams, and the better
party there, contending against their Laws, and the execution
of Justice, to the effusion of bloud, which made Mr. Willi∣ams
and the rest sadly complaine to the Government of the
Massachusets, and divers of them take the protection of that
Government, to defend their persons and estates. But when
they saw Mr. Williams resolve rather to lose the benefit of
his labours, then to live with such ill-affected people, and
the neighbour Governments become affected with Gortons
mis-rule there also, hee (and his Companions in evill)
began then to thinke of buying a place of a great aspring
Sachim, or Indian Prince, to the wrong of the proper Ow∣ners,
(two inferur Sachims) who also, as well as divers
English of Providence, submitted their persons and lands
to the Government of the Massachusets, and desired their
protection not onely against the oppressing tyranny of Myanto∣nimo
the foresaid Great Sachim, but against Gorton and
his Companions, who intrded into their proper right, by
unwarrantable meanes, &c. Now the Government of the
Massachusets having used all due meanes and none pre∣vailing,
but their gentlenesse answered with the greatest
contempt that might bee: At the next Meeting of the
Commissioners for the United Colonies they complained of Gor∣ton
and his irregular Companions, which the said Commis∣sioners
tooke into serious consideration, and the more because

of Gortons, &c. extraordinary familiarity with Myanto∣nimo,
and the rest of the Nanohigganset Sachims, who
were knowne to bee in a deepe Conspiracy against all the En∣glish
in the Land at the same time. And therefore by a
solemne Act gave liberty to the Government of the Massa∣chusets
to call them to account, and proceed with them so
farre as might stand with righteousnesse and justice, which
they accordingly did.
Now these Right Honourable, &c. are the true causes of all
the Censures and punishments that befell Gorton in the
Countrey; onely needlesly in his and their contemptuous an∣swers
to the modest and well-ordered Writings of the said Go∣vernment
of the Massachusets, they blched forth such hor∣rid
blasphemies, not onely against them in particular, and
Civill Government in the generall, but against the recei∣ved
Christian Religion of all the Reformed Churches in Eu∣rope,
as well as our selves; Insomuch as many tender Con∣sciences,
both Ministers and others, thought the Govern∣ment
did not well in giving him such liberty, whereby hee
may and doth (as is reported) poyson other persons and
places with his corrupt opinions, to the great dishonour of
God, and ruine of the soules of his followers, who reject the
meanes of grace Go hath sanctified to strenghhen and build up
his people in faith and holinesse.
But that I may not bee tedious, I shall presume to pre∣ferre
these following requests to your Honours and the rest
of the honoured Committee this Renowned Parliament hath
betrusted with the affaires of the Forraigne Plantatios of
our Nation: The first is to strengthen the Ceasure of the
Massachusets by your favourable approbation, so farre as it
shall appeare to bee just and righteous▪ and then shall the
Coutrey bee the more preserved from their feares of the
Gotonians desperate close with so dangerous enemies as their

malignant neighbours the Nanohiggansets; which I perswade
my selfe, if you leisures will suffer you to read the following
Discourse, you will easily condescend unto▪ there being nothing
(I thanke God in it) affirmed by mee, but as it is affirmed
hereunto I may safely depose. A second thing is, that yee will
never suffer Samuel Gorton this pestilent disturber of our
Societies, any more to goe to New-England to disquiet
the peace thereof. My third request is, that yee will
be pleased to suffer New-Plymouth, to enjoy their former
liberty in the line of their Government, which includeth their
very seat, even Shawamet it selfe, where Gorton and his
Company dwelt. My fourth request is, to take into your serious
consideration, how destructive it will prove to the well-being
of our Plantations and proceedings there, (who by Gods bles∣sing
are growing up into a Nation) here to answer to the com∣plaints
of such malignant spirits as shall there bee censured by
Authority, It being three thousand miles distant, so far as will
undoe any to come for Justice, utterly disabling them to prove
the equity of their cause, unlesse their estate bee very great.
My fifth and last request is, that your Honours, and the rest
of the Honoured Committee will be pleased to patronize the
weake labours of your humble servant, in the just defence hee
hath made for New-England, and the severall Govern∣ments
of it (especially the Massachusets) against the grosse
calumnies of the fore-mentioned scandalous Treatise published
by the said Gorton: And herein yee shall not onely oblige
our Plantations of New-England to continue their daily re∣quest
to the God of all mercies for a blessing upon this Renow∣ned
Parliament, and your Honours, and the rest of this Honoured
Committee in especiall, but to engage with, and for them and
you, against all opposers of the State, to the last drop of bloud
in our veines; yea, hereby shall you sweeten the tedious travels,
great charges and labours of me their unworthy Agent, who doe

and shall daily pray to God to recompense your vast hazzards,
expenses, studies, and cares, (to advance the Weale Publike
of this distressed Kingdome, and the severall limbs thereof)
with all the blessings of Heaven and earth to you and yours
to succeeding Generations.
