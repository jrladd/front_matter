RIght Honorable, if a man oughte of dutie to offer gretest recōpence where he lies most deeply indet∣ted, and that all seruices are due to those, from whome we receyue our only countenance and ayde: Truly of force then must J yeeld all my endeuours and seruice to your Honour, and my good Ladie Warwike, (the duetie reserued to my great Lorde and Master) towardes the requitall of the least part of your Ho∣nourable goodnesse, whome J haue euer

though J know and confesse farre to base for your worthie mind and calling: yet for that it best fitteth a melancholike heade, surcharged with pensiue and sullen hu∣mors, my earnest sute must be for good ac∣ceptance at your honors hands, and with∣all, to craue that it may boldly passe vnder the shielde and safetie of your garde, the better to brooke the hatefull encounter of swelling enuy, a common foe to such, as ei∣ther seeke by well doing, to win good will from equals, or by painful writing, to pur∣chase prayse from Peeres. The deuice is none of mine, but a collection out of sun∣dry Authors, aswell Italians, as French, from whom J haue gathered some chiefe points of Falconrie, to pleasure my Coun∣try men withall: In part for that I neuer found hitherto any booke treating of the same matter, in part, bicause J know sun∣dry Gentlemen (my great friends) deep∣ly

addicted to that commendable sport of hawking, whom if I may find as gratefull, as I haue framed my selfe painfull, I haue the hoped hire of my trauell, and they as∣sured to bestowe no more on mee for my forepassed industrie, than they are to re∣ceiue frō me for their after curtesie. So as there doth rest no more vpon my hands at this time, but to intreat your Honor to be∣stow your good liking, and lawful fauour vpon it, and me: For which as I haue al∣wayes beene by desert bounde, so will I by franke good will, rest most ready to the ex∣pence of my dutiful seruice vpon your no∣ble line and house, during the remainder of my life: wishing vnto your Honor, and my verye good Ladie, (Ladie Countesse Warwicke) all good successe and fortune, with maintenance and encrease of your Honorable state and present felicitie.
