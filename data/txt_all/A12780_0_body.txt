MOST faire and vertuous Lady; hauing sought opportunitie by
some good meanes to make knowne to your Ladiship, the humble affection and
faithfull dutie, which I haue alwaies profes∣sed, and am bound to beare to
that House, from whence ye spring; I haue at length found occa∣sion to
remember the same, by making a simple present to you of these my idle
labours; which hauing long sithens composed in the raw con∣ceit of my
youth, I lately among other papers lighted vpon, and was by others, which liked
the same, moued to set them forth. Simple is the deuice, and the
composition meane, yet carrieth some delight, e∣uen the rather, because
of the simplicitie and meannesse thus personated. The same I
beseech your Ladiship take in good part, as a pledge of that profession
which I haue made to you; and keepe with you, vntill with some other more
worthy labour, I doe redeeme it out of your hands, and discharge my vtmost
duetie. Till then, wishing your Ladiship all increase of honour and
happinesse, I humbly take leaue.
