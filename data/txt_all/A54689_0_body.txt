THe designe of these few sheets of paper in a second Justification of the Antiquity, Legality, Use, Right, Reason, and Neces∣sity of the Kings Pourveyance, or Compo∣sitions for them, and a Demonstration of the many great Mischiefs and Inconveni∣ences which will unavoydably happen both to the King and his People by the taking of them away, which was the endeavours of a larger Treatise, is not only to epitomize some part of what is therein already expressed, but to add many things which were before omitted, to the end that such as being imployed in the publique cares and concern∣ments of the Nation, & have very little or no spare time at all to converse with books, or that those who do preferre the interests of their vanities or avarice before such better com∣pany, may with no great trouble or labour, read that which is more at large to be seen in the former Book: but to take off the Opinion and Objections lately made of some who would perswade themselves & others, that the Compositions for the Kings Prae-emption and Pourveyance either taken

for the King, or served into his House in kind or money, or by allowances for them, were when they were paid or served, a great burden to the people, and none or very little profit to the King, by that time that the cozening of so many Officers and Servants in his Household, and their appetites of spoyl and rapine by their selling the Kings meat as well cooked and dressed as undressed, and of his bread, beer, and all manner of household provisions to the Inhabitants & Housekeepers in the parts adjacent were sa∣tisfyed, and other their purloyning and trimly varnished over pilfrings and disorders, which an unpaid Army, and the most unruly Camps of Souldiers or military men are not often guilty of; and the tricks and artifices of the Pourveyors and Managers of the houshold provisions which in Queen Elizabeths time made a Kentish Yeoman plea∣santly demand of her, being in her Progresse, when she was pleased to talk a little with him, and he perceived she was the Queen, If it were she that did eat up all his Poul∣try, which upon her second thoughts and examination, and proof made of the knavery of one of her Pourveyors, procured him shortly after a legal and wel-deserved hang∣ing. That too many of his Majesties Servants employed in the Affairs of his Houshold Provisions▪ are little better then Theeves in an yearly Pay or Pension, ravening Tartars, or neatly cozening Banyans; and that the Jews, or the most nimble Cut-purses, Jugglers, or Hocus-pocusses do not, if any thing at all, much out-do them. But that being said and imagined only, and not ever likely to be admitted into the virge of Truth or Evidence, will for the most part be proved to be meer suggestions contrived and cast a∣broad by the insinuations of some who do seek to preserve their own, as they deem it happiness, and increase of for∣tunes, by the ruine and miseries of multitudes, or such as

will take up reports, as many Gentlemen do Tradesmens de∣ceitfull Wares upon trust, and will prove to be no otherwise then as the blind man in the Gospel did in believing men to be walking Trees, when that which made them seem to be that which they were not, was his own mistakings, and by those, and other ungrounded scandalls, do as much service to the King by it, as the devouring Ingrossers do usually do unto the People, when they take away the more honest gains of the Retailers, to create unto themselves a liberty of imposing what rates they please upon them, and may be easily enough convinced by a discreet and juditious ex∣amination of particulars, haring of parties accused, sur∣vey of the excellent Orders and Government of the Roy∣all Houshold, (which are so exact, and limiting every Of∣ficer to their Liveryes, or stinted proportions, as some an∣tient and very able knowing Officers of the Houshold who do well deserve to be believed, have averred, and will be ready to assert that the Orders of the Kings House are so very watchfull, vigilant, and preventing of cheas and cozenings, as without a universal combination of all the Servants of the Kings House▪ which is never likely to be accomplished it is impossible that there can be so much as a Loaf or Manchet cozened from the King) and the daily care of the Lord Steward, White-staved Officers, and of the Green-cloth, although the yearly Salaries and Pensi∣ons be the same for the most part which were in the Reign of King Henry the Seaventh, when the Kings provisions were so near the thn cheap Market rates and prices, as they had not so much as an aspect of grievance, when ten thousand pounds was a good Dowry for the Kings Daughter in marriage with the King of Scotland,Accompts inter Evi∣dentia Co∣mitis Oxon. ten pounds per annum a good Annuity for a Kinsman to an Earle, a pen¦ny was but reckoned to an Earle of Oxford by his Ward∣robe

keepers for a pair of Gloves for his own wearing, and the value of silver by the ounce was then but little more then half a Crown,Stows Sur∣vey of Lon∣don. and but creeping up towards three shil∣lings four pence the ounce: and Nicholas West Bishop of Ely in the 23th year of the Reign of King Heny the Eighth▪ keeping yearly one hundred Servants in his house, gave the Gentlemen and better sort of them but 53 s. 4 d. and to the inferiour sort but 40 s. per annum, and the next year after that the ounce of silver was brought up to 3 s. 4 d. a fat Ox was sold at London for six and twenty shillings, Beef and Pork for an half-penny a pound, and a half penny farthing a pound for Veal and Mutton, was by an Act of Parliament in that year understood to be a reasonable price, and with gain enough afforded; and due consideration shall be had of the necessary differences which are to be observed betwixt the Pensions, allowan∣ces and expences of many of the Nobility and Gentry of the best extraction and houses of the Kingdome serving and attending in the Kings House: those that stand before Princes, and are to be clothed, as the holy Book of God hath told us, with Silk and soft Raiments; and those that are none of these, but do serve and take wages in Houses and Families of private men; and that the Majesty and Ho∣nour of a King in the Order and splendour of his House is not to be reduced to the pattern of private Housekeepers, and the narrow and unbeseeming Customes of their smaller Estates and Families. That the wast of honor and the more then ordinary Fragments left in the Kings House, as the remainders of the Dyet provided for him and his servants for the food and sustenance of the Poor, and such as will be glad of it, are but the requisites and appurtenances to the Majesty and Honor of a King, that Sir Richard Weston afterwards Earle of Portland, and Lord High Treasurer

of England, Sir John Wostenholme Knight, Sir Wil∣liam Pt, and others, commissioned by King James to make a Reiglement and Espagne in his house-keeping, being men of known and great experience in the manage∣ment of their own Estates, could not then find any such things as have been since laid to the charge of the Kings Officers and Servants in his House, that the pretensions not long after of better husbandry in the Kings House by some niggardly contrivances, and serving some of the Tables with half a Goose instead of a whole, came to no more at the last then the obtaining of the pretenders self ends, and an Annuity of 500l. per annum for th lives of the pretender & his wife, and the longer liver of them, that the Lord Chamberlain of the Kings Housholds yearly Fee of 100 l. the Treasurer of the Housholds yearly Fee of 123l.—14s. and the Cofferers yearly Fee of 100l. mea∣sured and proportioned to the antient and former cheap∣ness and means of livelihood, would have even then been very deficient for the support of such persons of Honor and Quality, if they had not had at the same time some seldome falling expectations of other favours and re∣wards from a Princely Master, and a present liberal al∣lowance for their Tables, which although it doth now stand the King, by the enhance of his rates and prices, in a great deal more then it did formerly, yet unto those that received those allowances for their Tables and Dyet, it is no more then formerly: for if an estimate were taken how much it would cost the King to make and encrease the Salaries and wages of his Servants and Officers of all ranks and sorts, which in all the several Offices and Places, and Dependencies about the persons of the King and Queen are above one thousand, all or most of whom did when the Tables and Diets were allowed, intercommune, one with

another, and were with many also of their Servants fed with the Kings Victuals, and Houshold Provisions, to be accord∣ing unto the rates of wages & Salaries, and as much as they are now taken and given in private Families and all were to be paid in money, and nothing in dyet, the Kings Treasury, Purse, or Estate would soon be brought to understand, that such increased Allowances, or other Allowances, Pensions, Wages and Salaries, which must according to the rise and enhance of all manner of things conducing to the support and livelihood of such Servants be now necessarily paid and given over and above the antient Fees and Salaries, would arise and amount unto more then all the charge of the Pourveyance or Compositions for them, whether it were thirty and five thousand pounds a year, or fifty thousand pounds per annum, which was laid and charged upon the Counties, or more then the King is unjustly supposed to be deceived or cheated by his servants, or those which do direct the affairs of his Houshold; when it cannot escape every private mans Judgement and experience in house-keeping that he that doth give his servants forty shillings per annum Salary, and as much more to be added unto it in certain Fees and Profits well known, and calculated to amount unto no more then another forty shillings per an∣num. doth give his servant but four pounds per annum in the totall, and is not at all cozened therein; and that it would otherwise be no Honour to the King, but a dimi∣nution of Majesty, and a temptation or necessity enforced upon his servants to deceive him, if the Serjeant of the Ewrie and the Serjeant of the Bakehouse, to mention but a few of many, should have but their antient and bare Sa∣laries of 11 l.—8 s.—1 d. per annum, and want their an∣tiently allowed Avails and Perquisites. That such short and now far too little Wages and Salaries to be given to the

Kings Servants in their several honourable and worship∣full Stations, would be unworthy for them to receive, and dishonorable for the King to give.
And that the no inconsiderable summe of money which was yearly and usually saved by the venditions of the over-plus of the Pourveyance or Compositions for them, and imployed in the buying of Linnen and Utensils for the service of the House; the now yearly allowances for Diet to eight principall great Officers and to seaven of the next principall Officers, and what his Majesty payeth yearly to others for Board-wages, and what is enhanced and laid upon him by unreasonable rates and prices, now that his Officers are constrained to buy with ready money, and to pay a barbarous Interest and Brocage to provide it, compared with what he now spends in his private allowances for his own and the Queens Diet, and some o∣ther few yet allowed Tables, will make a most certain and lamentable demonstration, that the King and his Honor were gainers by the Pourveyance os Compositions for them, and very great loosers by the taking of them a∣way. And that he did meet with a very ill Bargain by the Exchange of his Pourveyance or Compositions for them, for a supposed recompence of Fifty thousand pounds per annum intended him out of the Moiety of the Excise of Ale, Beer, Perry, &c.
But if the abuses committed by the Servants and Of∣ficers of the King within the house were so great, or any thing at all, as is pretended (for as to the Pourveyors, and those that act without dores, the Law hath sufficiently pro∣vided) they may certainly be rectified and brought under a reformation, without the abolishing or totall taking away of the right use of them, or that which cannot be spared, or by any means be abandoned, but may be dealt with, as we

do by our Wines, Victuals, or Apparel, which as necessaries of life are in their right use to be kept and reteyned, not∣withstanding any misusage of them.
Or if the Pourveyance or Compositions for them were so much diverted from the use intended by them, yet that will not be any reason for the quitting of them without a due exchange or recompence, for that if they were all of them, (as is meerly fained or fancid) mispent or misimployed yet those that do mispend them, and they that have the benefit of them (not that I would be an Advocate to justifie the sel∣ling of the Kings meat or houshold provisions unto any in the Neighbourhood, or any accursed cheatings of the King, which I wish might be punished as Felony) are neither E∣nemies or Strangers to the Nation, but the Kings Subjects and Servants, and the Children, Friends and Kinred of many of those which do contribute towards the Pourveyance or Compositions for them; and that which is so misim∣ployed, serves instead of some other largesses, allowances, or connivencies, which are usually in Kings Houses; and whether well spent or mispent, being Oblations and Offer∣ings of duty made by the People to their Sovereign, are not to be denyed or retrenched, no more then the misbehaviour of the Sons of Ely, with which the Almighty was so much offended, would have been any just cause of the Children of Israels forbearing to bring their Offerings.
It being no Paradox, but certain enough that those seeming, but not reall grievances to the People, by the Kings Prae-emption and Pourveyance, or Compositions for them, have no other source or originall, then the rise and en∣hance of the Markets, and all Victualls and Provisions, by which all the selling and richer part of the People are ten to one more gainers by the Kings Pourveyance or Composi∣tions for them then they can be loosers, and are better able

to bear it; and the poorer sort of the people were less griev∣ed when it was not taken away, then they are now by the Ex∣cise of Ale, Beer, &c. which comes in the place or preten∣ded recompence of it, that the Gentry and Landlords of the Lands in the Nation, who by heating of those Lands that were cold, drayning and drying of those that were wet and moist, watering of such as were dry and sandy, and planting of Wood and Fruit, have brought their lands to a greater increase and fertility, not yet come to its Acme or just height, then the former ages, and a thousand years knowledge or practise of our Forefathers, the Inhabitants of this Nation could before this last Age or Century where∣in we are now▪ ever reach or attain unto: and the Land∣lords of Houses, Innes, Taverns, Shops, or Stalls in Lon∣don, who have now by the increase of Tradesmen ra∣ther then Trade raised their rents ten or twenty to one more then what they were One hundred years agoe, might in some measure or moderation have taken their ad∣vantages of the improvements of their Lands, Rents, Houses, and Shops, without such an overstretching their Rents, as the Tenants where they have no Leases, but at will or from year to year in some Counties of England should be enforced, as many have lately been to throw up and forsake their Bargains; And that all or any of that over-high racking the Rents of Lands and Houses, or a supposed plenty of money, (which in the time of the greatest enhance and rack of rents, rates, and prices which ever England did see or endure, is now so scarcely to be found, as the universality of the people do heavily complain of the want of it) and the product or consequence of that evil in a like enhance of rates and prices by the Freeholders and Copyholders, who pay no rents, (as Farmers do) and by the Tenants of the King, Queen, Prince, or Bishops, & some

of the hospitable and well minded Nobility and Gentry, the Tenants of the Church and Colledge Lands, and of Lands belonging to Cities, Corporations, Companies, and Hospi∣tals, who have cheap and comfortable Estates and Bar∣gains, and yet do all they can to imitate them, although they have no cause to do it, which would be much higher.
If all the Copihold Estates in England and Wales were at as great a rack of rent as the Lands of the most of Farmers.
If all the Privileges and Rights of Common Estovers and Turbary, Modus decimandi, and Exemption from the payment of Tythes and Tolls were abrogated.
And if the King should keep the same rule and measure of high rating and racking of his Revenues certain or ca∣suall, as many Landlords do; Or make our East-India Merchants pay for their licence or priviledge of trading to the East-Indies,Sieur Col∣berts Re∣monstrance of the bene∣fit of the Trade to be driven by the French in the East-Indies. all others being excluded for one and twenty years, a share or proportion amounting in the whole very near a Million sterling money, as the Dutch have made their East-India Company to do, could not be the on∣ly proper or efficient causes of that long-strided and swift progresse, and increase of the rates and prices not only of victuals and all houshold provisions, but of all manner of commodities, apparel and necessaries either for use or or∣nament.
So as we shall not conclude without premisses, or be thought to want a ground or foundation of an irrefragable truth, that Lucifer the great Merchant and furnisher of our sins and excess, and of the great and intollerable pride of all the degrees and ranks of men, women, children, and servants in the Nation, as far beyond the former ages as a Giant is to a Pigmee, or Pauls Steeple in London when it was highest, to the Pissing Conduit (as they call

it) in Cheapside, and the avarice of the people to main∣tain it, together with the necessities attending their pride and vanities, have been no small part of the cause of it; for otherwise it would have been some difficulty to find or give a reason why we should not in England, a King∣dome, untill our late times of confusion, of the greatest peace and plenty in Christendome, be able to afford vi∣ctuals, and all manner of provisions for the belly and back as cheap as in France, where notwithstanding the heavy oppressions and burdens of the Paysants, who do fare hard, and are ill clad; and by reason of the frugality of most of the Gentry, a Partridge may be bought for our pence, and a Gentleman and his horse at night be very well en∣tertaind for four shillings: or as in Spain, where a Bando is yearly made by the Corrigidores of every City and Place (which the Civil Law doth allow and direct,Lessius de Just. & Jur. lib. 2. cap. 21. n. 148. Cokes 4. part. Insti∣tutes 12 Ed. 4. c. 8. 25 H. 8. cap. 2. and our Laws of England do as to victuals also intend) setting yearly the rates and prices not only of all vi∣ctuals and houshold provisions for the belly, and of fruit and Apples, but of all Commodities, as Linnen and Woollen Cloth, Silk, Knives, Has, &c. where notwith∣standing their continuall Warres, and multitudes of hea∣vy Taxes to mainteyn them, there is a cheapness of vi∣ctuals, and such an absence of deceit, as a child, or the most ignorant way as to measure, weight, and prices, buy and not be deceived. Or as is in the same manner done at Rome, Naples, Florence, Milan, and most of the Principalities of Italy, not so freed from publick Burdens as our more happy England is at this present; which neither would nor could be there ever submitted unto and obeyed as it is, if the pride and necessities, or avarice of the Landlords, and the pride of the Tenants (which the Pragmatico's forbidding the pride and excess of apparel, do in Spain

very much eradicate) were not less then ours, and their frugalities more; and such restrictions and reglements thereby made to be the more tolerable and contenting.
And those that do like it more then they should, and shall be content to imploy their times in the pursuit of va∣nities, and means to mainteyn it, and forsaking the old and good wayes, and seeking gain, do sacrifice unto their nets, and burn incense unto their drags, may have that said unto them which the Apostle St. Paul did n another case to the Romans; what fruit have the in∣tollerable pride and excess of the Nation,Epist. Rom. 6. and the high racking of Rents to mainteyn it, brought unto those that have taken pleasure in it. And they that have so much de∣lighted in it, may now, if they please, or at one time or another, understand whether they will or no, that the over∣much raising and stretching of the rents of the Lands and houses in England, since an excessive pride and fol∣ly of the people is come to be so much in fashion amongst us, have been no gain to the Nobility and Gentry, but will be a great loss and damage unto them by that time that the wastfull and prodigall part of them have bought and fur∣nished their Houshold provisions at the dear rates of their Tenants and others, of whom they do buy them, and their apparel and other the Merchandises of their follyes of the Citizens and Trades-men; and not only therein bear the burthen of their own, but of the intollerable pride and gallantry of the Citizens, Tradesmen, Mechanicks, Artifi∣cers and their Wives and Children, and in all that they do buy of them, do contribute to the costly Pearl, Neck-laces, Diamond Lockets, and other Jewels, satten and cloth of silver Peticoats, plush Gowns, Embroderies, Gold-lace, Gorgets of threescore pounds a piece, and Lace of twenty or forty pounds a yard, worn by the Merchants, Drapers,

and Mercers Wives, and the Silk-Gowns, Hoods, Laces, and over-costly Apparel of the Mechanick and Artificers Wives in their desires and ambition to live like the No∣bility and Gentry, when no man can tell they are any, or ought to be.
That the enhance of all provisions of victuals brought to London out of the Countries, hath made the Country people proder then they should be, and the City Wares and Commodities dearer then otherwise they would be, and made the Citizens, in the pursuit of pride and luxury, run out of their wits and estates to purchase it.
That it was better in former times for the Artificers and Day-labourers, whose more moderate expences in their veral conditions and qualities made them heretofre with a fourth or fifth part of what they do now earn, grea∣ter gainers by their labours then now they are, and better for servants, whose far lesser wages then now, they will be contented with, did amount unto more, or as much as they do now gain, by reason of their former smaller expences in clothes and apparel.
The Tenants and farmers lived better when they plowed their Landlords lands, mowed, reaped, and helped in with their Harvests carried home their wood, and paid small rents, then they have or can do now that they are strained to the highest, those labours and services coming far short (if they were at the now rates to be hired or paid for) of the addition, which time and change of manners and customes have since made to their antient and unimproved rents.
That the people of England, if there had been no other ground or reason for it, might well have afforded to have given the King so much as they were yearly charged with the Pourveyance or Compositions for them for an acquital

of more then twenty years arrears of it by the Act of Obli∣vion.
That if an estimate could be made of those Millions or summes of money sterling, which the enhanced prices and rates of victuals and houshold provisions did amount unto yearly since the 24th year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, and what the rise of victuals and houshold provisions have come unto yearly since the Pourveyance and Compositions for them were laid down, and what it may more be stretched unto, if pride and price, not like Ca∣stor and Pollux, to bring our Ship into the Port, but to ruine it, should go on in that carreer it is now in, and pri∣vate and particular interests more mighty and prevalent then all those imaginary monsters which Hercules is sa to have subdued, and of a greater force then that Devil and his heard called Legion, which our blessed Saviour did dislodge out of the man possessed with them, shall be ayders and abetters of it. There is no man that hath not bid defiance to his reason and understanding, but will ac∣knowledge that the people of England had better give ten times or more the yearly rate or value of the Pourveyancees or Compositions for them then endure the Impositions, which they have, or shall put one upon another whilest every man will seek to save himself and make his labour or commodity afford him as much as he can to recompence him for it.
That the unreasonable rates and prices put upon all the Kings occasions or services by Land and Sea, are and will be the cause of Taxations and Assessements in times of peace three to one more then formerly.
And the Levies of monies to hire Souldiers, and raise and maintain mercinary Armies, will amount unto and charge the Publick ten or twenty to one or more than

when by the help and ready ayds of Tenures in Capite and by Knight service our gallant and well-armed Nobi∣lity and Gentry could upon any occasions of warre or di∣stress either at home or abroad be sodainly summoned and made to appear from Ireland as well as from all parts of England and Wales.
And so readily as King William Rufus sitting at din∣ner in Westminster Hall, and hearing that Mayne a Town in Normandy was much distressed by a sodain Siege laid unto it by the French King,Speed Hist. of England. and resolving in the great∣ness of his mind not to turn his back towards it untill he had relieved it, could cause the wall to be broken down on the South side, and passing towards the sea coast, com∣mand his Nobility and Knights speedily to follow him.
That the unparrallel'd pride of almost all rancks and degrees of the people not permitted in France, Spain and other Neighbour Nations brings our Forreign Trade almost to nothing by the adulterating of our Com∣modities, and making them false and slight, and causing the charges to be much more then formerly in the work and making of them, pay of our Mariners and greater rates of victualling, so as we being not able to make our manu∣factures so cheap as other Nations, and making them slight and false, our Trade must of necessity more and more decay, and will never increase or be advanced, if the Dutch were banished out of the world, or ordered to trade only in the Bottom of the sea, and leave all the Sur∣face or Top unto us; the cheap diet and clothing of their Common people, the neat and frugall diet, and the appa∣rel of the Burgers, and those that they call the Gentry, giving them the advantage of under-selling us.
For we may be sure that there will never be cheapness of victualls, or houshold provisions, or good trading, and

truly called plentifull living, if Citizens Wives, and some of no higher a rank then Sciveners, shall have their Trains born up at Funeralls, as if they were Countesses, or Baronesses, and give the world to understand by that Noveint universi, that pride hath made them run out of their wits, and may in a short time, after that rate make their Husbands run out of their Estates. And if Taylors Wives may, as they are not now ashamed to do, wear Pearl Neck-laces of 100 or 120l. price, and some of the grea∣ter sort of that now too overbusied Profession, keep their Coaches, and make their Customers pay for it. A Lin∣nen Draper being to buy an Horse for his own use must have one at no lesse a price then forty pounds: the Wife of a Sales-man, or one that sells Petticoats, Wast∣coats, or Gowns, trimd, and made up in a seeming cheap, but a most deceitfull manner, for Servants, or people of ordinary quality, can wear a Neck-lace of forty pounds price: And some Shoemakers Wives do not think their Husbands do go to the Devil fast enough, if they do not so abuse the more honest intentions of their Trade, as to make their Wives learn to hold up their heads to shew their Pearl Neck-laces of forty or fifty pounds price, which is many times more then all the shoes in some of their Hus∣band Shops are worth: Every Cook, every Alehousekeeper, and the lowest and meanest sort of Mechanicke and Han∣dicrafts men, and their Wives, shall be permitted to vie in  Apparel, and manner of living with the Nobility and Gentry: A Frock-porters little Daughter shall go with her breasts and shoulders naked, white shoes, Coif and Pinner well laced, and all to be ribboned: and a Day-labourers Wife in the Country, within the infectious breath of the pride of London, wear her Taffata Hoods Gold and Silver-lace, and a Gorget not much below

the yearly rent of the little Tenement her Husband is at night glad to rest his weary and durtied limbs in: and that there will be never any hope or possibility of any thin▪ but high rates and prices, vices and villanies, when th do so hugely ise and ncrease by reason of the pride of the Nation, as the Keeper of the Boomss pit, and its everlasting burnings, may well rejoyce in the plentifull coming in of his Harvest and Merchandise; and that if there were nothing of wickedness to be found in the heart of mankind, that most fertill Seminary and seed-plot of it, and no other cause for it, the only excessive pride of the Nation would by a necessity of providing maintenance for it, be a cause efficient and impulsive to make or fo∣ment all manner of wickedness, fraud, cheating and cozen∣idg, drive the Wives and Husbands to betray one an∣other, Servants their Masters, Children their Parents, Pa∣rents their Children, and Brothers and Sisters to forego all naturall affection, care and honesty one towards another.
That it is, and will be impossible by any Trade or In∣dustry to mainteyn this Nation in either peace or plenty, when all the men in it shall in their Apparel, Dyet and Expences make it their business to live as the Nobility and Gentry do & most of the female Sex (Servants not excep∣ted) shall not be contented themselves, or let their Husbands live in any quiet, unless they may live like Ladies and Gentlewomen, and be the Daughters of vanity and folly.
That at Paphus and Ciprus the old and antient Coun∣tries of venery as well as vanity, where their Daughters do, (as some Authors have written, and Travellers do report) entertain strangers by prostitution of their bodies, to get Dowries or Portions for some mad Husbands to marry them.
And in all the Luxuries and pride of Rome, Asia,

Tire and Sidon, and all other the destroyed and ruined Nations by it, there were some distinctions in Apparel, Dyet, and Expences; some Servants distinguished by their Habit, and not all Masters or Mistresses to be found a∣mongst them.
And that England being overchaged with a Generati∣on of too many Proud, Lazi, and Lavish People, is not▪ nor ever will be able to maintain them without a sinfull necessity put upon the Nation, as there is too much already, to cheat and oppress one another to support them in it.
And should have more reason to believe then to doubt, that the honor of a Prince is the honor of a People, and the people so much concerned in it, that it was wont to be a cura curarum, one of the greatest cares of the Magistrates under Kings and Soveraign Princes seculis retroactis in the old and long ago past ages of the word attested by the hoary heads of time & antiquity practised by a Jus Genti∣um, universal Law of Nations, rude and untaught Indians not excepted, and continued to this day in many forreign parts, and most of the Western Nations, to give an especi∣all honor by gifts, enterteynments, and presents to Embas∣sdours, who in those particular employments were but the images and representations of foreign Princes sent on Em∣basses unto theirs: And that we ought to take it to be a duty incumbent upon us not to want, or be to seek for as much goodness as the old Heathen Persians were Ma∣sters of when Artabanus told Themistocles the Graecian Embassadour that apud nos ea Lex praestantissima qua venerati Regem tanquàm Dei effigiem jubet, with us▪ that Law which commandeth reverence to the King as Gods Image, is accompted to be the most excellent.
And therefore untill the wisdome of our Parliaments shall by some sumptuary Laws to be enacted, which may

as easily be done, and put in execution, without any damage or loss unto Trade, or his Majesties Customes, a those that were made and enacted in the Reigns of King Edward the Third, Henry the Eighth, and Queen Mary, unhappily repeald by King James, or those not long ago made and kept alive by our Neighbours of France and Spain, or late∣ly ordained by the sage Venetians: Or by the Swedes, those strangers to the Sun, and Inmates of Snow and Ice, after they were grown rich and proud by the spoil and plunder of the unfortunate Germany, and a way may be found out to drive back, and reduce unto some Order, as formerly the unchristian liberty of pride now in fashion amongst us, which is so horrid and ridiculous as might turn the weeping and laughing Philosophers out of their humours, and make Heraclitus laugh, and Democritus weep; to∣gether with the daily more and more growing and encrea∣easing high rates of victuals and houshold provisions, which is, and will be the sad consequence of it.
And is so fixt & pertinacious, as that the Kings own ex∣ample of plain and uncostly Apparel, the care of the Church and Pulpits, the scourging & detestation of vice appearing in some of our Plays and Interludes, and the jeers and scoffs of some people as they meet with it in the streets, have not yet been able to bring or perswade too many of them into their wits again, the compass of their estates, and sobriety of their forefathers.
