ALthough the lowness of my Condition, and my For∣tunes hath not permitted me to prosecute Studies deep or diffi∣cult; and that I know my self too well, to affect or aim at the being in the form of Philosophers or Polititi∣ans: yet I may perhaps without presumption pretend something to both, though afar off, and at a mannerly distance, without the cen∣sure of vanity. Whilest I entertain my self and others with the humblest Subject that can well admit so ma∣ny and so useful Observations as have from thence arisen to me, and men of the greatest Consideration.
The wise man directs to the Pis∣mire
mire for instruction; I have the ad∣vantage of proposing a president much more exemplary, and more deserving our imitation; for, this better inspired Insect, the Bee; being it self untaught, gives us variety of Lessons not unworthy, in many things, of Princes and of States-men, of good Subjects, and such as would grow rich, and prosper. And, even the most eminent Philosophers, that pry with the most penetrating Eyes and Imaginations into the secrets of Nature, have with much study and amazement contemplated the Bees, whom they have found to be as Bu∣sy, Forcible, Curious, and Re∣markeable as in any of her greater works, which attract more of our admiration, and enquiry, my design is not to dispute peremptorily, with Aristotle, Pliny, or other my learned Masters, who have elaborately con∣sidered
and discoursed of the nature of Bees, and their faculties; although I may upon new and plain discove∣ries sometimes deviate from them. Nor shall I with Virgil, describe with Fancy, and fine invention these little people, which are indeed wor∣thy to be celebrated by so excellent a Poet: My business, by the good helps I have had, is to shew Nature, and Truth naked, and unadorn'd, with Metaphors or suppositions; for I would be considered only as a Tra∣veller who hath carefully, studiously, and faithfully visited and examined other Nations, to bring home to pub∣lick use, & information, the observa∣tions he hath made, of their living and subsisting, their Laws & Government, their Arts and Manufactures, and the strengths, and pollicies by which they preserve themselves upon all occasi∣ons, I have therefore with much sin∣cerity
laid before you what I have collected from Authors of the high∣est degree, as well as more modern writers, and what my Eye hath seen, my experience proved, and certain my knowledge can, and hath demonstrated, and will therefore hope that you (who are the greatest Judges I can appeal to, where Art or Nature are concerned) will find reason, upon farther examination, to recommend as things useful, true, or strongly probable at least, the farther Discoveries I have made; or have brought to a clearer light what hath been more obscurely, or un∣certainly guess'd at, or treated on by others, whilest I manifestly shew how Bees may be best understood, enjoied, and preserv'd alive, to the benefit of cruel and ungrateful Man∣kind, who hitherto, like the worst of Robbers, hath spoyled them at
once of their lives and treasures. And although they seem indeed but as it were so many Flies playing in the Sun, or among the Flowers of the Field. Yet, if we shall vouchsafe to consider them, as we do our selves making boast of our Reason (which as it is abused by us, is as much our condemnation, as our Prerogative) and of our greater Bulks, and Domi∣nion man hath above these minute Creatures; it may be well confess'd that the Divine Providence hath not in any part of its high and misteri∣ous operations called for our won∣der more than in the contrivance, the councel, and the signal assi∣stance, it imparts to these little So∣cieties of Bees, who as well as the proudest, or the greatest Giants of the Creation may brag that Est Deus in Nobis; and who by that Divine and Extraordinary impulsion (with∣out
out experience, or instructions de∣rived from their short lived An∣cestors, whom they could never know) do evidently, and as it were by a well applied Rule, and by an in∣stinct less erronious than that Reason it self which oftentimes misguides us; and by laws more steady and invio∣lable than those of the Medes and Per∣sians, subsist, and govern, with Pru∣dence, Foresight, Courage, Oecono∣my, Fidelity, Regard to Interest, and all those Offices and Virtues, which mankind hath at any time arrived to for the preservation of it self, and of Humane Society. And the more to assimulate them to man∣kind, we shall discern as in an Epi∣tome, the Vices, and the Passions, the Envie, the Robberies, and the Murthers, which the ambitious, the Idle and the Depraved do practice upon the Earth. And, we shall now
find their qualities, and their works, better discovered, and demonstra∣ted, by the transparant Hives first shewed to us by Dr. Wilkins, late Bishop of Chester, a most Eminent Member of your Society, which have since received several variations and improvements by one Geddie, and since by my self, with such infor∣mations and instructions, as I have found necessary for the rendering them more practicable, and useful. So that every person may either ga∣ther Honey, or pleasant Observa∣tions; from these intelligent Crea∣tures; who deserve well from all, especially from those who may pre∣tend to Virtue and Knowledge, a∣mong whom you are Princes. And I therefore.
