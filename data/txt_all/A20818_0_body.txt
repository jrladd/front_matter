GOod Madame, oft imagining with my selfe howe to manifest my well mea∣ning vnto your Ladishippe, and in my loue towardes you, most vnwil∣ling to bee founde ingratefull, either in the behalfe of my Countrie or the place of my byrth: To the one, your godlie life beeing a presi∣dent of perfect vertue: to the other, your bountifull hos∣pitalitie an exceeding releefe.
Then (good Ladie) my selfe, as an admyrer of your manie vertues, and a well-wisher vnto your hap∣pie and desired estate, doo here present the fruites of my labours vnto your modest and discreet considera∣tion, hoping that you will measure them, not by my a∣bilitie, but by their authoritie: not as Poems of Poets, but praiers of Prophets: and vouchsafe to be their graci∣ous Patronesse against any gracelesse Parasite: And en∣deuour your selfe with this good Debora, Hester and Iudith, (whose songes of praise I here present to your Ladiship) to the aduancing of Gods glorie, and the beau¦tifieng of his Church. Thus committing your Ladiship and all your actions to the protection of the Almighty, and my short translation to your curteous censure, I humbly take my leaue. London, this 10. of Feb. 1590·
