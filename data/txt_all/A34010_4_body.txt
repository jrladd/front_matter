My LORD,
YOƲR Lordships Candor, and Gentiletse, have given me an in∣vitation to make my Humble Addresse to you, who are most Propense to give a kind reception to the smallest Pre∣sent, offered in great Duty and Affection; Whereupon I am very much encouraged to give you the trouble of my mean Sentiments,
This Sheet to be placed before Folio 511. which I am as∣sured (though no ways meritorious of your Lordships esteemes)
shall receive a Candid Interpretation; and whatsoever is amiss shall have the Honour of your Lordships Pardon, and be in some sort rendred significant in your acceptance, who can make small things great, if you set a value upon them, as ordinary Stones are made Jewels, when worn by Persons of Honour.
And now my LORD, the Results of my Retirements and Studies do tend toward you, as a Center of high Learning, and great Knowledge; and plead no excuse for their forward∣ness, but the assurance of your great Goodness, that re∣jects no application made in high Devotion, in which I pro∣mise to my self a fair interpretation, as offering an occasion to your Lordship, to exercise your profound parts, in making a great search into the Mysteries of Nature, in which you have been long highly versed, as entertaining your Self in your vacant Hours, with much pleasure and satisfaction.
And although these little notions which I have heaped to∣gether, cannot add any thing to your more Learned apprehen∣sions, yet they may sometimes give hints, whereby you may actuate your more elevated Thoughts, and employ your Fancy, and put the body of your Learning into Fermentation, by pre∣senting you with the circumstances and parts of such Senti∣ments (which hold Analogy with your more deep Conceptions) the Passe temps to alleviate your more severe and serious Hours.

And now my Lord I beg the freedom, with your permissi∣on, to tell your Lordship, without Flattery, I have most high esteems, not only for your intellectual, but Moral Per∣fections too, as those of a greater Magnitude, and higher Orbe, which render you illustrious in the eye of the World: Your great inclinations to do acts of Honour, Charity, and Justice, and your most Generous Humeur of Treating your Friends with a most civil Deportment of kind Looks, amicable Ge∣stures, and pleasant merry Language, do endear and captivate your Associates in a free, open, and ingenuous Converse, at∣tended with good Cheer, and excellent Diet, as so many ex∣presses of your noble Entertainment. And your heroick Vir∣tues are covered with Humility, as with a Vail, like a Beau∣ty shaded with Tiffeny, which transmits its excellency to the Eye, made more greedy and apprehensive by a thin transpa∣rent restraint.
And now I take the boldness Humbly to present your Lordship with the mean Discourses relating to the Organs of Generation, consisting of a Noble Apparatus of great variety of excellent parts (framed in admirable order) which your Lordship, and your accomplish'd Lady have highly improved in a fruitful and hopeful Progeny, which I hope will render you immortal in successive Generations, till time shall cease, and be swallowed up in a happy Eternity.
My Great intention at this time, is to give you my most Humble Duty, and most Affectionate Esteems, accompanied
with hearty wishes for your Health and Happiness, and shall ever deem my self highly Honoured to improve my utmost pow∣er in all good Offices to serve your Lordship; having this design, That when Posterity shall see your Honoured Name employed to rescue these Papers from Contempt, they may with more confidence expect in them something fit to be offered to a Person of so great Honour. My Lord, I am Master of my Aim, if I can serve you in your Interests; and I shall deem my self well rewarded, if you shall be pleased to give me your Pardon for this trouble, and put me in the number of your Relatives, who am most passionately for ever,
My LORD,
