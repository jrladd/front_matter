WHan I had fi∣nished
this tre¦tise
(right ho∣norable
lorde)
I thought it
mete accordīg
to the good &
accustomed v∣sage
of wryters, to dedicate it vn∣to
some woorthye person, whose
thankful receyuyng and allowyng
thereof, myghte cause it to be the
better accepted of other. And forso
muche as it was not of value to be
geuen to any auncient Counsayler
whiche are all therein sufficientlye

seen already, I iudged it most con∣uenient
to be geuen to somme that
were yonger: Emong whome for
so muche as your learnyng, & ver∣tuouse
towardnes, was greatlye
commended of dyuers and sundry
credible persons, I doubted not
but that your good disposicion na∣turally
taken of your vertuous pa¦rentes,
woulde take in worthe the
gyft of this simple treatyse, which
although it answer not fully vnto
youre estate, yet disagreeth it not
muche with your age, whiche with
your good report and vertuous dis∣posicion,
hath emboldened me to
dedicate it vnto you rather than to
any other: humbly besechyng you
to pardon myne audacitie herein,
and to take in good parte the sim∣plenes
of my gyfte. In whiche so
doyng, ye shall not onely ensue the

steppes of your honorable father,
whome God for his excellent and
manyfolde vertues, ioyned with
very gentylnes, hath called to the
high office protector of this realme
vnder ouer soueraygne Lorde the
kynges Royall maiestie: but shall
also cause other the more gladly to
desyre it, to the greate encoragyng
of me and other lyke, whiche for
the commoditie of our countreye,
woulde gladly helpe forwarde all
honest and vertuous studyes: A∣mong
whome although I am the
least bothe in age, learnyng & wit,
yet is my good wyll not muche be∣hynde
the formoste.
And because that your lordshyp
maye the better knowe how to vse
this treatise, and all other of mo∣rall
Phylosophie, I haue in my
prologe to the Reader shewed the

ryght vse thereof: wysshyng that
all whiche shall reade the Booke,
shulde fyrst note the Prologe: that
Phylosophye maye haue her
lawfull prayse, the holy
scriptures, theyr due
seruice & reuerence,
and God hys
honor,
worshyp, and glorye: Who
kepe your lordship, with
your honorable Pa∣rentes,
in healthe,
and felicitie.
Amen.
