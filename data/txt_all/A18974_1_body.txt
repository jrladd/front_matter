MY Honourable Lord The Title or Inscription of this Trea∣tise needeth no other declaration, then your Lordships name Prin∣ted in the fore front, & first page of this Booke. For your perfecti∣on is the liuely image, which my thoughtes had in this Descrip∣tiō: you are the real patterne of this verbal discourse, & the Cyrus meant in this Institutiō: You are the mirrour, (as Socrates, or Bias said) wherin I would haue all No∣bles to contēplate thēselues, ether to see their own beau∣ty, if they be truly Noble, and therby to cōtinue in vertu∣ous and laudable actions, or to wash their spots, and a∣mend what is amisse, if they be degenerate or ignoble. Yea since it hath pleased God to match you with such a Vertuous, Noble▪ & Faire Lady, I iudge it most conueni∣ent (in Ioining the Theorie to Practise, the effect to the cause) to submit this Preface, and first Booke vnto your fauourable construction: not as a sufficient description of your perfection, or as a recompence of your well deser∣uing, but as a short abridgment of your ample vertues, & a poore pledge of my bounden dutie. And seeing
Nec laudare satis, dignas{que} rependere grates
Sufficiam, referant Superi.
