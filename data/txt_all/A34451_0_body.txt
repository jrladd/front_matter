MOst Noble and Acute Searchers into the Vulcanick Anatomy: I would not be wanting to manifest the glory and ri∣ches of this ancient Spagyrick Art, which I have seen and done, by proje∣cting a very little of the Transmuting Powder on a piece of impure Lead, which in a moment) was thereby changed into the most fixt pure Gold, enduring the sharpest examination of fire, so that none need doubt, but certainly know the first material Mercury of Philosophers is to be found, and is as a fountain overflowing with admira∣ble effects. Yet it is not in my thoughts to teach any man this Art, of which I my self am yet ignorant, but only to re∣hearse the proceedings I have seen. For it is only the part

of Bruits to spend their life in silence▪ and not to declare that which might propagate the honour of the most Wise, Omnipotent God our Creator: It being ungrateful for men, (who ought to participate of the divine nature) not to glorifie their maker. I shall therefore without flourishing, faithfully relate whatever I saw and heard from Elias Artista, tou∣ching this miracle. For truly I was not so intimate, that he would teach me to prepare the Ʋniversal Medicine throughout the Artificial, Chymical, Physical Method, yet he vouchsafed such a rational Foundation in the Me∣thod of Physick, that I shall never sufficiently extoll his praise. Receive therefore this small present which I offici∣ously Dedicate to you for admiration. Farewell.
