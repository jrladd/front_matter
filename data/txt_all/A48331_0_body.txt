SIR,
THis Treatise being finish∣ed, and ready to see
the light, I could not be∣think my selfe of a fitter Patron then your selfe
to protect it; Your know∣ledge in, and affection to the Sciences
Mathe∣maticall, as also the civill respect which You usually
vouchsafe such as affect those Studies, arme me with this confidence.
I foresee that this my presumption in expo∣sing this Work to
publique view, may meet  with some Detractors, but Your
approbation thereof, will both convince them of their Errour, and plentifully
satisfie me for the pains I have taken therein. Howbeit, what reception
soever it may obtain with the Vul∣gar, my intention (I doubt not) will give
me support and encouragement, my ayme therein being nothing else but the
pub∣lique good, and this my Dedication an evidence to let You know how much I
am,
SIR,
