RIght honourable the late dangerous attempt rash∣ly by mee vndertaken to row in a small Boat to the Cittie of Bristow a long the perillous Rocks Breaches, Rases, Shelues, Quicke-sandes and very vnlikely places for passage wyth such small Boates, along the Coast of En∣gland, is now by the assistance of almigh∣ty God truely perfourmed, as appeareth by our seuerall certificates ready to bee seene, with our safe returne, contrary to the ex∣pectation of sundry persons, which being truely and particularly discoursed: I haue presumed to dedicate vnto your honor: wherein may plainely be seene, how wee aduentured to passe the force of dangerous Flawes and rough Seas, which we found in our voyage: And proueth the attempte the more straunge in respect that I was ne∣uer

trayned vp on the water: not doub∣ting but the same may be a iust occasion to pricke forward other of my natiue cuntry∣men to practise an ordinary passage tho∣rough the like dangers in such smal wher∣ry Boates, especially when necessary occa∣sion shall serue, the better to daunt the e∣nemies of this nation, who in such flawes and frets at Sea, dare not hasard their Gal∣lies to go foorth, though they bee of farre greater force to brooke the Seas. Thus humbly desiring your honours fauorable acceptance hereof, I end, beseeching God to send health and long life to her Maiesty my dread Soueraigne and most gracious Mistres, peace to this land, and to your ho∣nor euen your hartes desire.
