MY most honoured LORDS;
 The desire to know, and to be knowne, are equally predominant. There is in both a kinde of infinitenesse, which Nature comes short off, and can not fill. Bookes, including matter supernatu∣rall, better satisfie it: They extend Fame as farre as the vtmost limit of Time, and Knowledge beyond; being the clearest Oracles to the liuing▪ and faith∣fullest Heralds to the dead: All other Inuentions are lame. Touching Fame, how barren a shift was he driuen to, that was faine to adopt a Pillar? Tombes die like their Tenants, and are buried in their dust whom they burie. Those Liuing Tombes, and Speaking Epitaphs (Children) are neither built when▪ nor as wee would. Whereas Bookes (the only issue, wherein our Wiues cannot defraude vs) though they be often

conceld by Time, yet in euery next impression finde a new be∣ing, and haue an artificiall Immortalitie of their owne, still protecting their Protectors from the murther of Obliuion.
Hence I haue extracted a hope, that your Lordships might be pleased to pardon my gratefull and humble presumption, in consecrating my Labours to your Names. The great French Henrie, and the Illustrious Leonardo Donato now Duke of Venice, held their greatnesse no whit lessened by Patro∣nizing the Originall, neither will your Honours bee much blotted by the Translation. Your Names shall shine to Posteritie in the same gold, though lesse curiously stampt. If my zeale may likewise shine out to you, I aspire to no third happinesse. Thus wishing your Lordships the same fulnesse and maturitie of Honour that yee haue of Vertue. I remaine.
