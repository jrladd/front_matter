SIR,
I hold it (as I
ought) one of the
rich mercies of
GOD, that he
hath giuen me
fauour in some
eies which haue not seene me; but

none, that I know, hath so much de∣merited
me, vnknowne, as your wor∣thy
Familie: Ere therefore you see
my face, see my hand willingly pro∣fessing
my thankfull Obligations:
Wherewith may it please you to ac∣cept
of this parcell of thoughts, not vn∣like
those fellowes of theirs, whom
you haue entertained aboue their desert.
These shall present vnto you our
bountifull Sauiour, magnifying his
mercies to men, in a sweet varietie;
healing the diseased, raising the dead,
casting out the Deuill, calling in the
Publican, and shall raise your heart to
adore that infinite goodnesse; Euery
helpe to our deuotion deserues to be
precious; So much more, as the decre∣pit
age of the world declines to an heart∣lesse
coldnesse of pietie: That GOD,
to whose honour these poore labours
are meant, blesse them in your hands,
and from them, to all Readers.
To his protection I heartily commend
you, and the right vertuous Gentlewo∣man,

your worthy wife, with all the
pledges of your happie affection, as
whom you haue deserued to be
