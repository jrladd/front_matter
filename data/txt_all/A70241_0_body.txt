Madam,
THe two following Sermons, here humbly presented into your hands, may have leave to beg if not pre∣tend, a Title to your Patronage, The first having been made in a good measure, long since, upon occasion of the death of that excellent person Sir Roger Townshend Baronet, your Ʋncle; and now made seasonable, by the late losse of your dear Husband, that worthy and nobly descen∣ded Gentleman Mr Fane as also of your dear father Mr Cartwright, a great losse both to his Family and Coun∣trey; your Husband deceasing in the morning, and your Father about the Noon of his age. The second Sermon, may plead for your acceptance also, upon this accompt, that it was not long since preached at Ayno, upon the Anniver∣sary for the foundation of the Free-school there by your Grandmother and God-mother, Mrs Mary Cartwright, late Lady of that Manour: Madam, should I be censured for this Addresse to you, your birth at Soulderne when I was Minister there, my Obligations to your Husbands Family, as also to your Father, Mother, and Grand∣father Cartwright, with other of your Relations shall be my Apology.

 So with my hearty prayers to God for you, that you may go on in the good ways of your educations, and that al∣though you are left Husbandless, Fatherless, and Mo∣therless, yet that neither you, nor yours, may ever be left Friendless, helpless, or comfortless, but that he would please to be a comforter, a Friend, a Father, a Husband to you, and that you may be the blessed of the Lord, and your off-spring with you, I humbly take leave and remain.
Madam,

June, 27th. 1676.
