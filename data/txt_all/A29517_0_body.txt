SIR,
THose Infinite Obli∣gations
you have
been pleas'd to lay
upon me, have em∣boldened
me to pre∣sent
you with this
Discourse; not by way of Retaliation
(for what proportion can this hold
with your so many, and so great fa∣vors?)
but by way of protection:
that what is weak in it self, being Che∣rished
by the Rays of your kind
Aspect, may be able to pass through
all those Affronts, which works of this
nature usually meet with. It had been
easie to have varnisht this Work over
with the finer Colours of Rhetoric; but I
well knew, that you, who are so great a

Lover of Truth and Sincerity, scorn all
that Fucus, with which men com∣monly
daub over their Works. The
occasion which drew me on to under∣take
a work of this nature, was those
frequent Cheats put upon honest and
well-meaning people, by these false
pretenders to Arts. If therefore I have
contributed any thing in order to un∣deceive
the world, which is too fond
of such Trifles, I have my end; you
Patronizing my endeavours. May
Heaven ever prosper you, and all those
Hopefull Branches of your Family,
and may I rejoyce in your Patronage,
who am,
Honoured Sir,

Brockton in the County
of Stafford, Novemb.
7th. 1679.
