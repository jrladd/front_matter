My Lord,
IT hath been the general practise of writers, to dedicate their books of Art and learn∣ing, to learned and honourable persons, under whose patronage they are protect∣ed, find the better acceptance abroad, and the instruments attaine the opportunity to acknow∣ledge their duty and thankfulnesse to those whom they reverence & honor. The last whereof was the cause that brought these things into a book, and the book unto you.
The main subject whereon it consisteth, is, the very Quintaessence of Hypocrates, Galen, Ioubertus, Para∣celsus; and other learned men of these latter times, which for the most part have been experimentally tried and approved excellent, though in generall they have been kept secret and hidden from the publick; for whose good I have taken some pains to put them into such a method, that all that have need may receive benefit and comfort. Having such a Talent in my hand I thought it my duty to improve it to the best advantage of the republick; for herein the rich may at least take delight, the middle sort gain knowledge and experience, the poor find relief, when they want money to seek for other help, and all sorts of people remedies against all kind of maladies, sicknesses or diseases incident to mans body, if they be carefully administred and applied, according to the di∣rections.

set down, for here is variety of medicines accor∣ding to the nature of the disease, whereas some Empe∣rick of our time, have but one plaister for all sores.
Here is also set down certain rules and directions for Physitians and Chyrurgians which are no lesse necessa∣ry to be known, then the subject or matter on which they are to work; for I find it recorded, that Paracelsus did more good in his time, by making known the Theorie, then Gallen did in all his life, which more then doubled the years of Paracelsus.
Non nobis solum nati sumus, &c. is a true position, and was never more really practised then by your Lordship, whom God hath raised up to be a principal instrument to preserve this nations peace and tranquillity: and for this cause the whole Common-wealth challengeth an in∣terest to your honour, and look upon you as their chief protector against the Common enemy, the great Physi∣tian, to cleanse and purge the evill and maligne humors; which are apt to arise in the body politick, that the God∣ly receive comfortable and refreshing cordials, nay e∣vē the dew from heaven, under a flourishing pious mini∣stry, in a land of peace flowing with milk and hony. And the great Physitian both of soul and body, preserve you with increase of honour, and length of days, which is the prayer of.
