ALbeit I doubt not but your grace procedeth in ordinarye pra∣ctise as other your complices & col¦legees doo, for the maintenance & proppyng vp of your prelacy & Papistical kyngdom, yet I thought good to aduertise your grace (by this traslated letter folowīg of the practise & proceding of your very frēd ye bishop of Verona, legate in Polone, who although he hath had sinistre successe in the Popes affaires in that realme by reason of ouerlerned Princes, & men of ouer muche experiēce in prelates practises, yet if his tru¦sted frendes had not disclosed his secretes, there had ben better hope of his enterprise. And nowe lyke as the displayeng of his se∣cretes in sundry tongues hath dissolued his doinges, and marred the Popes market for euer, not onely in Polone and Prusia, but also in sondry other places and dominions where this practise is bruted, and no hope of
 redresse, onles bribing helpe, so must your grace with the rest of your Englishe prela∣tes vse faire woordes, familiar entertain∣mente and liberalitie towardes the nobles of Englande in tyme, and yet where bry∣bynge and bealycheare wyll not serue, you must take occasion by one pretense or other to go in, as ye haue will begon, in chopping of theyr heades, and hangyng vp for holy∣dayes of the suspected fauourers of the go∣spell, and as nere as ye may, make the En∣glishe bloude thynne, namelye the gentil∣men and riche people, so that when they are ones pulled vnder foote, ye maye pyll and subdue the commons at your pleasure and transpose the realme as ye luste. And as I dout not the experienced dexteritie of your handlyng the popes affaires in England in bryngyng the realme into hunger, misery, and dissencion, so were it to be wyshed that your Prelates and vnskilled cleargye in o∣ther places, wer instructed in ye lyke practi∣ses with all silence and secrecy, least the vy∣sour of hypocrisy beyng plucked of (as the byshop of Veronas vnlucky chaunce was, and your brybynge and bloudsheadyng co∣myng ones to lyght) cause further peryll to your states than hytherto hath ben felt.
The God of al mercy and might confound all false and wicked practysyng. Amen.
