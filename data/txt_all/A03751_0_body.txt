My very good LORD;
THe Titles on which this Dedication is grounded have prooved stronger then my bashfulnesse, or feare; for your singular candor of minde, makes mee hope an
acceptance of my good intentions, though joyned with weake abillities, and (besides the honour of my relation to your Lordship in bloud) the expe∣rience I have had of your Noble and gracious favour to my selfe in particu∣lar, gives me assurance, that you will not bee displeased, if for protection in an undertaking exposed to much op∣position, I addresse my selfe to your Lordship. For so earnest have they been in this controversy, as now at last (even since this little Treatise was un∣der presse) they have objected to me; that wee are bound to beleeve as mat∣ter of faith, the generalities delivered by the Popes Holinesse, though the wisedome (say they) of the See
Apo∣stolike for bearing to irritate Christian Princes, descendes not to particulars.
Thus indeavour they to beare us in hand, that wee are bound to professe what they conceale from us, and that Catholike faith must bee all one with mysterie of
State, and consequently every good Christian being bound to professe his
faith, with the losse of his life and living, we must in this questi∣on bee tyed to no lesse, for a secret in policie, thought fitting to bee kept from us out of reason of
State.
The very laying downe of this their last refuge, sufficiently dis∣covereth the weakenesse thereof: so it onely resteth that I crave your Lordships pardon for presenting it out of due place to your Lord∣ships
View; to whom as Chiefe, both by nature and merit, I am obliged to professe my selfe,
