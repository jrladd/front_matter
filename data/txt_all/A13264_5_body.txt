MY DEARE SIR;
WHil'st others declaime (too iustly) against the dull charities of the times, and the coldnesse of affecti∣on in their Allies, and bloud, I cannot but magnifie their worth, in you, where I haue met a vertue, scarce ex∣ampled by a second, friendship in a brother. I thought it a high iniustice to smoother such a miracle, and therefore haue heere set it vpon
 record; that, as the age may blush at her other prodigies, so glory heere, that she hath (at length) brought forth one who hath not lost either his Nature to his alliance, or piety to his Countrey. A goodnesse seldome paralell'd in these dayes of ours, these degenerate dayes of ours, when we may finde a more naturall cor∣respondence, a liuelier heat of affection, amongst those of sauage and barbarous condition, than in the bosome of our owne Tribe and Nation. But I may not taxe, when I am to salute, 'tis out of the roade of gratulation; this is intended so, A meere declaration of my thankfulnes for all those your noble Offices of a reall brother∣hood, which though I haue not power (as yet) to satisfie, I shall haue euer will to acknow∣ledge, and in that loyaltie I persist,
