IT was mine exercise, right
honorable and my singu∣ler
good Lord, to make
vppon a playnsong not
long a goe fortie seuerall
waies of 2. parts in one,
with what cōmendation,
I shall then perceiue, when other shall haue
iudged, with what study, my selfe am priuie:
neither long, nor serious. This poore conceit I
haue presumed of your honorable fauour to
present vnto your Lordship: vnder couerture
of whome, to the view of the world: not but
that I knew it, vnworthie of so high a perso∣nage,
but rather that it needed the more noble
patronage, the lesse is in it to recōmend it selfe,
which how litle it is, I am greatly in feare Her∣vnto,
my good Lord, I was the rather embol∣dened
for your L. great affection to this noble
ience, hoping for the one you might pardō
 other, & desirous to make knowē your in∣clination
this way. For howsoeuer my skill be

nothing such, as in least part to expresse the
dignitie of the art, yet this I am sure of, if graue
auctors haue rightly informed mee, that the
wisest men as Pythagoras & Plato, haue made
it their studie, and most honorable persons as
Hercules and Achilles, their earnest practise.
Besides this, my good Lord, I beare this con∣ceit,
that not onelie my self am vowed to your
commaundement, but all that is in me is dedi∣cated
to your Lordships seruice: so that, albeit
I am vnable to make shew of my deuty in such
sort, as I wish: yet to transport to other, what I
owe to your Lordship I demeed not to sitte
with such a profession. Onelie if it shall please
your honorable minde to measure my deede
by my desire, it may happily seeme somewhat,
which of it selfe is lesse then nothing. Which
beseeching your Lordship with all instancie,
and as before hoping, so now most humbly
crauing pardon of my presumption, I rest in
prayer for the preseruation of your honour in
long life, and great happynesse, in the one to
match the oldest, in the other the blesseddest.
