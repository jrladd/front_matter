FOr dedication of this booke to you (R. w.) I had direction frō the Riuers, who Eccles. 1. 7. empt themselues in∣to the Seas from whence they came. To you, by whose Reuerend praedecessors I was in common consent chosen scholler into Christ-Church; by whom that small modell of Lear∣ning which I haue (if I haue any
 thing in mee which may be called Learning) was deriued to me, and by whom I was of free donation, without bribe or sute first placed in my pastorall charge. Then you, I haue no greater patrones; for you, I haue no greater gift. And this I offer to your view, your censure, your memoriall. God euer graunt you so to blesse the Colledge of Christ-church, by your free electi∣ons and elocations, that the Church of Christ may euer blesse God for you, and your selues may feele the comfort of your well-doing in this life, and find the fruit thereof in the life to come. London 27 of April M. DC. XVIII.
