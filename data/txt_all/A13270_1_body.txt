SIR,
WHen you were pleased, the other yeare, to ad∣mit me your Chaplaine, I had intended, and pre∣par'd my paraemetiall ob∣lations to your Lordship, from the Pulpit; But I was, then, preuen∣ted by a sudden, and seuere sicknesse, which hath, hitherto, disabled me to tender you any thing that way.

But I feare my infirmities, and therefore, as I must begge the honourable charitie of your Pa∣tience, so of your Protection also. For as I was, at first, a suiter for your seruice, (In which I haue cause to glorie) both for the greatnesse and goodnesse of your selfe, and name) so I am, still for the graces of it: and doe hope, that when you haue made a ful∣ler enquiry, who I am, and where I haue spent my time, and talent; your Lordship will not disdaine to owne, and honour mee with your succeding fauours. In a word (my noble Lord) I shall not forget what you haue made mee, nor the dutie enioyn'd me by it:
I will pray for you, for your Lady, for your little Ones, and for the growth, and con∣tinuance of the house begun in you; and what else is requir'd in a religious obser∣uance, you shall surely find in the faith and loyaltie of
