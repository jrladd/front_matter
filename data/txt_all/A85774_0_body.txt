My Noble LORD,
THat which Solomon saith, Eccles. 12.12. Of making many books there is no end; I suppose doth nothing at all concern me; for I have not made many books; and he that begins late, may soon
end; especially being too too far remote from those useful helps of voluminous Writers, many books; yet this have I made, and humbly present unto your Lordship, is a Testimonial of my thank∣fulnesse, for your Lordship's manifold and Noble favours exhibited unto me. Now such as my sacred Profession is, such also is the Matter and Subject of this I present, Theological. An Ex∣position it is (such as it is) of what happened in the Wildernesse, and other Places, between our Saviour and Satan; Preached at first for the instruction of my Parochial Cure; but since, as touching the more difficult points, some∣what enlarged for publique view. Many will see it; but my most humble suit is, that none may own it but your Lordship. The Author acknowledgeth, that, under God, be liveth by your Lordship's Pa∣tronage;
may this Book also, in another sense, live so too. I am,
My Noble LORD,
