May it Please Your Majesty.
THere is nothing of greater advantage to a Land, than the opening of Rivers, that by the Com∣munication of them, the more Inland Countries may not only abound with all the varieties in which they exceed, but that all other manner of Goods, (though never of so great burthen) may be daily imported or exported to the incredible case and benefit of the Sub∣ject.
Your Majesties great Predecessor, Henry the 1st. was well experienced in this truth, who by cutting a Channel upon the Trent for seven miles length, did bring it down to his City of Lincoln, and being the first that conveyed so great a bene∣fit to his people, doth stand alone by its self, in fame and glory. No doubt but the like hath been desired by other Princes of this Nation, who being hindred either by For∣raign or Domestick Warrs, or wanting the help and advice

Who left noe way vnsought wth: those in prsent Govermt: to perfect so laudable a design
If Your Majesty approve of this Overture presented, and be plea∣sed to command my attendance on the Lords of your Majesties Pri∣vy Council, I shall be ready to give them futher satisfaction herein, for the perfecting this so glorious a design, and remove all difficul∣ties; and wheras I have set down in my printed papers this Naviga∣ble passage to be used only in the winter season, when our Rivers do Swell, yet upon a re-survey, we do find with a little more charge, for carrying Vessels of forty Tun burthen, or thereabouts, all the yaer long.
