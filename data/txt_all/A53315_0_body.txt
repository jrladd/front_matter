SIR,
AS the dispute with the Stage is drawing to an end, so it seems to go off on Mr Col∣lier's side, the greatest numbers

have with him declar'd against a Theatre, and those who vindicate the Poets or their Writings, will with their best Argument, want the most powerful Protection to defend em from the par∣tiality of the Publick. Thus Ne∣cessity as well as Inclination, forc'd me to shelter these Reflexi∣ons under your Name, that alone can influence the opposite par∣ty, to read any thing further on a Controversy, which they fancy is clear'd entirely in their fa∣vour. However, there are none of 'em bold enough to op∣pose your Sentiments, and your opinion being against 'em they'll not presume on a Majori∣ty to stand out against Reason and Conviction. The Soveraign Excellence of your Judgment

will prevail over Faction and Prejudice, and bring the most obstinate Enemies of the Dra∣ma to Temper and Moderati∣on. The Beauty of your Geni∣us will make 'em asham'd of their Malice and Ignorance: and when we talk of you they'll readily agree with us, that the Muses even in this age, have produc'd some things both use∣ful and pleasant You'll pardon me, Sir, that while I have your Picture before me, I only view those perfections which are most agreeable to my subject. That I avoid looking on what is great and wonderful, and turn the prospect to what is mild and- lovely. That I forbear menti∣oning those extraordinary Qua∣lities, which have render'd you

the Glory of your own Nation, the admiration of others, and un∣der his Majesty's Courage and Conduct, the best support of the Government, in its most pressing exigencies. That while with many millions I feel the be∣nefit of your Ministry, I omit paying you those acknowledg∣ments, which every true English man owes your prudent Coun∣cil, and happy administration in the high Station to which his Majestys Wisdom has advanc'd you. The fears which restrain me from persuing so tempting a Theme, will to you be the least criminal part of this address tho to the World they would be inexcusable, but that 'tis ex∣pected from better hands, who

are more capable to do it Ju∣stice, tho no man can be more willing than,
SIR,
