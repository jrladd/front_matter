YOur Royal Highness having been
graciously pleased to constitute
me Judge or President of the
High Court of Admiralty, I
held it my duty (according to
my poor ability) to assert the just Jurisdiction
thereof, against those undue encroachments and
usurpations, whereby the power of the Lord

High Admiral hath been heretofore, and is at
this present straightned, in decision of matters,
relating to Maritime affairs; wherefore having
some time since in those sad and distracted times,
bestowed some labour in searching and perusing
such of the Records of our own, as well as For∣reign
Nations as I could meet with, wherein the
just extent of the Admirals Jurisdiction is suf∣ficiently
and undeniably evidenced, together with
the necessity of deciding all controversies about
Maritime affairs, according to the ancient Sea
customes, and the reason and directions of the
Civil and Maritime Laws. I held it no less my
duty to recollect the said Papers, and reduce them
into some method for the clearing those objections
which hitherto have been and still are made use
of, either against the antiquity or extent of the
Lord High Admiral his Jurisdiction in Ma∣ritime
causes, or against the decision of them by
the ancient Sea customes, and the rules of the
Civil Law: And as I have observed this Nati∣on
hath happily flourished a long time, under
that happy Government of all Land affairs by
its municipal Laws, practiced in the Common
Law Courts; so hath it no less prospered and
been enriched in its Navies, Trade, and Com∣merce

under that exact Government which hath
ordered and guided all Maritime businesses and
Sea affairs, by the Civil and Maritime Laws
and Customes (corresponding, agreeing, and ac∣cording
with the Laws of Forreign Nations, be∣ing
suitable to the nature and negotiations of the
people that are subject to them) exercised and
practised in the High Court of Admiralty:
The design therefore that I propound to my self
in the publishing this Treatise, is, to shew how
necessary and fitting it is, that the power and
jurisdiction of this Court should be no longer sub∣ject
to such interruptions; and how expedient it
now is, that the rights and privileges of the
same should be observed and kept, and the Laws
and ancient Customes thereof, whereby all Com∣merce
and Navigation is upheld▪ should be pre∣cisely
and strictly preserved and maintained:
That all which may appear, I have set forth the
antiquity of the Lord Admirals Jurisdiction
here in England, by ancient Records of the
Tower: Next the Jurisdiction it self, and the
extent thereof, as also the necessity and neces∣sary
use of it in divers respects. In all which I
have endeavonred neither to eclipse the honour,
power, or least right of the Muncipall Laws of

this Kingdome, nor in any sort to detract from
the renown of the Reverend and Learned Pro∣fessors
thereof, but hope I have manifested that
the upholding of both Jurisdictions, and re∣straining
each of them to its proper limits and
confines, will be more advantagious to this King∣dome
and the Inhabitants thereof, then the suf∣fering
eitber of them to swallow up or devour
the other. Be pleased therefore to receive this
unpolished work from the hand of your Servant
as the same is dedicated unto the protection of
your Royal Self.
