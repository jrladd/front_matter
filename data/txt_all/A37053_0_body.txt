SIRS,
'T Was with much Reluctancy that I prevailed with my self, to Preach this Sermon, but with much more, to Print it. Not but that I had a great willingness to serve you
in both; but because I judged my self un∣meet for either. I was never, when Youn∣ger, fond of such Publique Imployments; Nor valued my self so high, as to think this busy World at leasure to concern themselves with any thing that I could publish. Much less can I cherish such vain thoughts now, when broken (to say nothing of hard usage) with Age and Infirmities. Might I have been left to mine own Beloved Privacies, you had never had the trouble, either to have Heard or Read this. But as I affect not Popularity, so I perfectly hate Incivility and Ingratitude. Your great kindness hath obliged me to gratify you in what I may; and your Importunity hath prevailed to have it Preach't and Publisht. Importunity prevails with God; and what am I that I should stand out against so many Gallant men, and good Friends, who have prest me till I was asham'd?

May it find but the like Acceptance with you in the Reading, as it did in Preaching, it will be incouragement enough to skreen it, against all the Censures it may meet withall.
But I am very little sollicitous for its de∣fence, so long as Les Gens d'Armes, the whole Artillery of this Royal City, have invited and undertaken its Patronage. In∣deed, not to defend so much it, as their own Judgements, who have pleased by their ap∣proving and desiring it, to make it their own. If it prove acceptable to you, and in any measure Serviceable to the Publique, it will be abundant contentment and satisfaction, to
Gentlemen,

October the 12th 1670.
