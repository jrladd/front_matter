NOtwithstanding the great and unvaluable good that hath in all
ages of the World accrued to Mankind by Order and Goverment, yet such is the
depravedness of mans na∣ture, and imperfection of his knowledge, that it is
as well hard to find out, as difficult to maintain, such a Form and Order of
Goverment as will prove a sufficient Fence and security for so great a
treasure as is the common good, and publick safety. After the sad and
long experience of former times, some have thought no means can be found out
so effectual for the upholding and and preserving the same, with all the
sacred and civill rights and privi∣ledges therunto belonging, as a liberty
for people to designe and choose out from among themselves, the persons
that are to be intrusted with those great concerns. Whatever may be said
for the extolling the hap∣piness of them that have such an advantage in
their hands, all that may be comprehended within the compass of such a
power, it is for the pre∣sent in the principal and leading part thereof
devolved upon your selves in all the three Colonies of New-England;
who by the choyce of the free people in those your several Jurisdictions,
are now called to act your se∣veral parts as chief on the publick stage of
Goverment. Ever since you have taken your turns at the helm, there have been
very boisterous winds and rough Seas, threatning the shipwrack of all;
which notwith∣standing, you need not be discouraged, while due
consideration is had, to whom, and what you have embarqued with you. When
once the great Roman Conquerer, and chief founder of their Monarchy,
was passing the Adriatick Sea in a disguize, the Pilot being
dismayed with the fierceness of the wind, the raging of the waves, his
Passenger pulled off his disguize, and  bid him be of good
courage and not fear, for he carried Caesar, and all his Fortunes:
Surely Jesus Christ and all his promises, in which you are not a little
concerned, is a far better ground of comfort and encou∣ragement in a stormy
season. Luther was wont to say, or did once in a great exgent say, that he had rather
ruere cum Christo quàm stare cum Caesare; accounting
Christ a better friend, though falling as to the world to tust to, then Caesar
standing in power, according to the words of Christ himself, greater
is he that is in you, then he that is in the World: So as all such may
say with the Prophet, Rejoyce not against me O mine enemy; for when I
fall, I shall rise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a Light
unto ; which I trust
your selves have had so much experience of, in these late dark
dispensations, that if sometimes you have not seen, yet al∣wayes you
have believed that Light was sowne for the righteous, and that there
shall be a cleer breaking forth of the sun, after the tempest is over;
what God hath planted, shall not by man, or any of Satans Instruments be
plucked up. It is with young Colonies, as it is with trees newly planted, which
those winds, as one saith, that are not so boisterous as to blow down,
doe so far advantage as to shake them to a greater fastness at the
root. The Soveraign Ruler of the World doth usually by such wayes and
meanes bing about his peoples
good, at the first, not well understood, nor easily brooked, till the
quiet fruit of righ∣teousness be discerned to spring
p unto all such as are
exercised therein. It hath been no small advantage that the staff of
Goverment, and the shields of this part of the earth were put into your hands
(before the Boar out of the Wood hath broke into this Vineyard) who under God
we trust may be found the repairers of the breach, and the Restorers of
Paths to dwell in, while both your selves, and those under your charge, and
conduct, are looking unto him, who is promised to be the peace of his people
when the Assyrian shall come into their land.
The consideration of the power wherewith you are invested,
together with the great Wisdome, Faithfulness and Courage by which it hath
been managed by you, in your several stations, hath induced me to desire
that the Historicall dscourse ensuing might pass into publick view under the
umbrage of your Protection. If a reason be demanded for the entitu∣ling so
many names of worth to the patronage of so small and inconsi∣derable a
Volume I need no other Apology at this time,
e I find in the words of the Wse Man; there are cases wherein two are better then one,
and a three fol Cord is not
easiy broken: For it being
like to pss through your
several Jurisdictions, I conceived it might need a pasport 
of safe conduct from him that doth preside in either of them. It carries
nothing with it but truth, (as I hope will be found) which may wel ex∣pect to
meet with a ready Welcome, and suitable entertainment in every honest mind;
but all men are not so equally ballanced in their affctions as to bear with plain dealing, and give that
harmless dove a resting place in their minds for the sole of her foot.
O all Writings, those tat are historical, specially while the things menti∣oned are
fresh in memory, and the actors themselves surviving, had need be
pursued with a wary space. Notwithstanding the great care that hath been
taken to give all and every one, any way concerned in the subject of the
discourse, their just due, and nothing more or less, yet perhaps some
critical Reader will not let every sentence pass with∣out some censure
or other. It was once by a great man accounted no small offence in an
harmless Poet, that some of his titles were misplaced as they were
marshalled up in their order: If any Historian should com∣mit an error
parale thereunto, a pardon, as it
may be needed, in such a Script as is the present Narrative, so may it be
the better expected while passig up & down under the guard of your authority, yea thô it
should chace to be an offence of
an higher nature; as the miiming
of some pssages, mistaking
he distance of some places, or too often touching upon the same
particulars, which could not be well avoided in a Collection of so many
occurrents too hastily drawn up, though true, yet unsea∣sonably, or out
of due time coming to light without a total omission of some material
passages. It was intended at the first only as a private es∣say,
wherein to bind up together the most memorable passages of divine
providence, during our late, or former troubles with the Indians; it
might have remained in the place where it was first conceived & formed,
or been smoothered as an imperfect Embrio, not worthy to see the light, if
some such as your selves had not both quickned the being, and hast∣ned
the birth thereof. Something of this nature may be of use to po∣strity, as well as to those of the present Generation,
to help them both to call mind, and carry along the memory of such eminent
deliverances, and special preservations granted by divine favour to the
people here; as it was of old commanded of God himself, that a Register
should be kept of thos Warrs,
which in opposition to others, were in a peculiar manner to be called the
Warrs of the Lord; and such are these here treated of, if any, since
miraculous deliverances have ceasd, may truly be said to deserve that title. If it had fallen
into some able hand, it might
have been set forth with better choyce of words, and more fit
expressi∣ons,  that might have left a deeper impression on
the minds of those who are most concerned to retain it; however it being
now like to be brought to publick view, I have presumed to offer it to your
selves, as on the accounts forementioned, so also as a testimony of my
thankfull and deserved acknowledgment of that wisdome and integrity
abundantly shewn forth in the administration of your authority.
Much honoured and Honourable, I have nothing more to adde, but the
engagement of my continual and daily prayers to the God of the Spirits of all
flesh, that he would carry you through all troubles, diffi∣cultyes and tryals
you may be conflicting with, whither personal or po∣litical, and that he
would bless your Councells at home, prosper your enterprizes abroad, and
long continue your light in the present Genera∣tion, for his own glory, and
his peoples good, that after you have served your Generation here, your
memory like that of the just, may be bles∣ed, and that you may leave peace
as the inheritance of the remaining Is∣rael of God in these ends of the
earth, which is and shall be the earnest wish, and constant desire
of
 From my Study
