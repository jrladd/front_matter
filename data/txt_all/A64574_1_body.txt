IT was the custome of the First Philosophers (Most Serene and Mighty Prince) that what∣soever Secrets of Things, or Mysteries of Nature, they found out, they would imme∣diately impose Divine Names on them; and so, as much as they could, hide them from the Vulgar; or else they would relate them under disguised Words, Forreign and unusual Terms, Allegories, Aenigma's, and Metaphorical Spee∣ches, either because they feared the offence of the Unskilful Multitude, or else being perswaded, that those Abstruse things would meet with no approbation, if they were easily understood.
Hippocrates of Coos, treading in the same steps, that Divine and Venerable Old-man, and deser∣vedly Chief in this most Famous Art (in whose Praises the Ancients, and all Neotericks have suf∣ficiently Expatiated) shews the hidden Founda∣tion of this Noble Science, in these words. If
there be any thing Divine in Diseases, the know∣ledge and fore-sight also of That is to be sought af∣ter, if a Man would approve himself a good and admirable Physician. But what that Divine Thing was, he no where clearly discovered, nay, he Studiously and of purpose concealed it, expresly affirming, that nothing ought to be spoken or pub∣lished in this Art, save what was known to Plebei∣ans. On which account, Physick was heretofore esteemed Sacred, and the gift of God, so that all the Ancients were of opinion, that It could hardly be attained unto by Humane Understandings, be∣cause the Foundations thereof seemed so abstruse, hidden, and admirable, that They were not to be found out by the strength of Nature; And al∣though, heretofore, and in all Ages, Men of great account for acuteness of Wit, and Skill in Physick, have Illustrated Its Doctrine, yet there is no∣thing extant in their Writings in clear and express words, neither can any thing be culled out from thence, but what is sullied with Obscurity: They all endeavouring as much as they could, more to eclipse and darken It: Neoterick Physicians who succeeded them, in Writing, Disputing, and de∣siring to encrease this Art, have falne to pieces amongst themselves, and contemning that Di∣vine thing in Diseases, rail at one another, and are divided into several Sects; neither doth the Division cease to this very day: For one desires to be styled a Chymist or Methodist, another a Gale∣nist, a third a Dogmatist or Canonist, so that this most Noble Ancient Hippocratical Medicine, which is but One, is now, not only rent into ma∣ny Sects, but is also overcharged with an infinite number of Books, by which a lover of, and en∣quirer
after Truth, is not only confounded, but must needs be over-whelmed: There being such a vast Ocean of Them, and so great a variety of Writers, subtilly spinning out their Arguments pro and con.
In the mean time, I was always of opinion that That before-mentioned short Sentence of Hippocra∣tes was to be deeply weighed, and the rather, be∣cause that Famous Man, whom Antiquity did al∣most reverence as a Deity, comprehended that great Supellex and Furniture of Things which he had in his mind, in short and concise Aphorismes and Speeches. Excited therefore by my respect and love to Him, I began to Investigate what that Divine thing was; for without the Plenary know∣ledge of It, the Art of Cureing Diseases would always be Mutilous, and only Inchoative, never fully and absolutely compleat in all its parts.
Some there are who do accuse those men of Im∣pudence, and do also Contumeliously reproach them, who do their utmost to restore and under∣prop Sciences (delivered indeed by the Ancients, but now almost worn out by age, and Adultera∣ted besides) or else who do endeavour to add to them, or illustrate them: moreover they labour to Degrade such persons from the first Knowledge of things, and so to dis-inherit them from their possession of ancient Learning; by whose Calum∣nies the Enquirers after Truth, are deterred and led out of the right way.
If the ancient Philosophers had taken this course to reproach the Labours and Studies of Those that went before them, they had never pierced into the inward knowledge of Nature, but the Truth in many Sciences would as yet have been buryed
in Obscurity, and very few would have attained to any light in the Secrets of Nature.
But since Those Philosophers were pleased with another way and manner of Study, not being de∣terred or taken off from their honest Labour by the tongues of Revilers, but rather more earnest∣ly applying themselves to their Disquisitions and Studies; so that almost in every age, some one or other Art and Science was hatched or else re∣trieved, and from small beginnings, promoted to great encrease.
Semblably, why may not I more clearly open the sense of Hippocrates? That so the Ancient and Noble Science of Physick, and Method of Cures may receive an advancement? why may it not be lawful for me to Contemplate that divine, abstruse and admirable Thing, as well in Diseases as Remedies? and to restore It from Darkness to Light? Let the Tongues of Slanderers be si∣lent, let them not blame me, that being but a Puny, I first of all bear the Lamp to all that seek for Truth, in this Argument. Let all such Flies and Cantharides be packing, for as the One pitches on the slourishing Corn, and the Other fly into the sweetest Oyntments; so these foolish and sloathful Calumniators cease not to detract from the labours and manners of other men, perswading themselves that they shall catch much Honour and Glory, by fishing for it in the disgracing of others.
Avaunt such Thorny Medickes; Let them con∣tinually go a begging, and spend their time in collecting raw Receits, reformed neither by Rea∣son, Method, nor Judgement; which, Hippocrates disapproves and proscribes in the very entrance
into this Art, as unsafe, because not understood. Experiment, says he upon this account, is fal∣lacious: Neither let them Object to me, this my Institution, as a new and unprofitable piece, whereas indeed It is most Ancient, and found most true by solid Experience, not that I am so vain and insolent, as to boast my self to be the Author of It, I only profess my self to be its Interpre∣ter and Explainer.
These things I determined to do in a Book by it self, and therefore I pre-emitted my Hippocrates Chymicus, which Book seem ed necessary for the demonstration of the Subsequent Doctrine by known Examples. But now, seeing Malign Ig∣norance raigns in Our Art, I think it better to change my Resolution, and to reduce into this Compendium, what and how much of Divinity is in Ancient Medicine, as also in Natural Phi∣losophy, and in all things; All which shall be dis∣cussed, for the sake of the Prudent, in this Little Book.
I determined, Mighty Prince, and my graci∣ous Lord, to Dedicate this my grand Endea∣vour to You, not with an intent to Blazon the Genealogy of Yours and Your Ancestors most August House, that be far from me, for I know that all Adulation doth displease Your Highness; but because You are a Favourer of hidden Scien∣ces, and of all admirable Things, and especially a Patron of the Muses: which evidently appears, not only by that flourishing Academy which you have lately erected, but furthermore by those great Largesses and Stipends, wherewith you have endowed its choice Members, and learned Professors, out of Your incredible Clemency and Fa∣vour.
To which may be added Your Highnesses singular Courtesy, Bounty, and Benevolence, ex∣tended towards Me in particular, your poor Cli∣ent, the last year; and also that unspeakable Benefi∣cence, which Your Father, of happy Memory, a few years since, shewed towards me, which you by a rare Example have also doubled and out∣done: Which consideration alone had been suffi∣cient to have obliged me to make this Dedication to Your Self, and so to hang up this little Table on the publick Altar of Immortality, not only that my Writings may hereby speak to the whole World, but that I might manifest the symbol of a grateful mind, and might testify and profess my observance of You.
Be pleased therefore, Great Sir, favourably to accept of that admired Divine Thing of Hippocra∣tes, anciently adorned with somany Trophies, now consecrated to Your Mighty Name, and let it find a place there, whither the Messengers of a grate∣ful mind are wont to be admi, which, as I supplicate with that humility which becomes me, So I also beseech Almighty God from the bottom of my heart, long to preserve Your Highness in safe∣ty and prosperity; so prayes
VENICE the Ides of November, 1668.
