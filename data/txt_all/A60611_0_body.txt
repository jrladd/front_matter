My LORD,
THE Motive that induced me at this my Lemen-Course in the Cathedral, to Discourse upon the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Bloud, and particularly with respect only to its absolute necessity, was that, with which every man must be very much affected, that hath any concernment for the welfare of Souls, or any regard to the Honour of Gods Worship, or the peace of his Church.
For whosoever truly understands the present state of too many of our Parochial Congregations, cannot but be sensi∣ble, that there is not that regard had to, nor Conscience made of, that most considerable Office of the Christian Profession, that ought to be, or that hath been accustomed, in better times. And then what shame, as well as sorrow, must it needs be to the Faithful Curates of Souls, who as soon as that Office

begins, must behold their Charges to flee from it in throngs, as if they were frighted with some approaching danger; or to turn their backs upon it; as if they combined to offer an affront to the Priestly Function, and that Sacred Ordinance: And which is the worst of all, that they should so often in the year, repeat so many dreadful. Acts of Excommunication a∣gainst themselves; which they must be really presumed to do, when they customarily exclude themselves, from the greatest Blessing upon their Souls, which they can expect and hope for at God's hand, on this side Heaven?
But the comfort is, that malice it self cannot charge the Church of England with that disorder: For it's certain, that no Church could ever have made better provisions to In∣struct, Encourage and Oblige men to that Sacred and Ne∣cessary duty. We have not (blessed be God) deprived the people of one half of this Sacrament, in contradiction to the pattern of Christ in the Institution; nor do we perform the Service in a Language that may perplex their understandings, when its Administred: which the Romanists are known to do, and which the people might presume to be sufficient rea∣sons to justifie their absence and omission. Neither on the other side, have we set up a new frightful Tribunal in every Parish, which should examine, and Arbitrarily determine, the fitness of every Communicant, by the measures of their Adherency to a Party, and by their dexterities in giving account of some Religious phrases and opinions, peculiar to their Sect. As some of them, that have made a defection from the Established Church, have been observed to do, and by which, and for their unsolemn manner of its Administration, such as had understood

the Lovely Order of its Communication according to the Church of England, were easily tempted altogether to decline it.
No, my Lord, the disorder we complain of, and the intolera∣ble scandal, which the neglect of the Sacrament hath put upon our assemblies, is not the fault, but the misfortune and af∣fliction of our Church, and was first occasioned by an unhappy abuse, that was put upon the peoples minds in the late Confusi∣ons, by such, whose interest it was to break down all the fences of the Churches Unity, and thence to dispossess the vulgar of their orderly, peaceable, and obedient temper, that they might be the better prepared, to permit, and comply with their unwarrantable intendments.
And where some mens obstinate approbation of those practi∣ces, hath hindred the compleat repair of those breaches, the present calamity is, that not only the Separating party are de∣parted from the Sacrament, as they do from the established Worship, but even the looser and more inconsiderate sorts of men, being encouraged by their example, do presume to take a re∣proachful liberty to themselves to escape at that open gap, and do resolvedly continue in the same neglects, without any regard to what concerns Religion in general, or the publick appointed Service in particular: So that in those places Faction and Profaneness joyn hand in hand in the same opposition, and do give the Government the same incumbrance, and Almighty God the same dishonour. But the mischief ends not there; For 'tis visible, that too many also, that are restored to, and that do continue in a fair Communion with the Church in all other respects and parts of the Established Worship, do yet re∣tain an unaccountable obstinacy against the Sacred Office

and blessing of the Holy Sacrament; and are always at work to contrive all possible ways to decline and escape it.
And if at any time they be closely press'd to it, they are ready to clamour against it as a persecution of their Christian Liberty, and are resolv'd no way to be made sensible, that the intention and prosecution of the Law, is no more, than an Act of the Churches Charity, and an expedient of Gods mercy to their Souls. So that the Curates of Souls in such places, are brought into a necessity of this unhappy choice, that is, Either tamely to see their Parishioners continue in that scandalous defection from so considerable a part of their Christian Pro∣fession, and to connive at the Abominable Perjury of the Offi∣cers, that are sworn to guard Gods Publick Worship, or else to live in perpetual broiles and encounters with them (whose peace and welfare should be as tenderly dear to them, as their own lives) by the necessary Prosecution of the Law, in those Judicatories, where there is Provision made, to reclaim them from their Defailancies in such cases; and which are the only remaining expedients then to be made use of, when all other attempts to reduce them to their duty, are defeated and made unsuccessful.
Now, my Lord, to obviate all these evils by the best and most Christian method, that (I think) could be undertaken, was the great motive, and main inducement, why I chose at that time to Preach upon that Subject, and why I now have offer'd the Discourse it self to Publick view.
And thus, my Lord, having given your Lordship a full account of the Motive that prevailingly induc'd me to what I have done, and which may reasonably justifie my attempt in

that respect: I can with less difficulty acquit my self for my confident throwing it under your Lordships Protection. And that is, because it's visible to the world, that wheresoever your Lordship hath exercised any Jurisdiction, it hath not been your Design only but your Zeal, to promote the Interest of the Holy Sacrament, and to recover the People under your several Suc∣cessive Charges, from their long discontinuances and neglects of it. And for this I could offer some pregnant instances of your Lordships care, even in this your present Diocese, if I thought your Lordship would permit me. So that whether I consider the Usefulness of the Discourse, for them that may need such an information of their duty: or the suteableness of it to your Lordships Design and Inclination, I hope it will not be a Presumption in me, to beg and expect Your acceptance of it, as it's Humbly presented to Your Lordships Patronage, by
My LORD,

Norwich, March 26. 1680.
