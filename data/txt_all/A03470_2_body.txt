HEire of thy Sires foure Realmes, and (which I more
Esteeme) foure vertues, that vnto a fift,
No doubt will thee (o slowly slowly) lift;
eiue this Ryme of thine old Auncestore
ong Prince of Wales, and pardon me therefore.
So may glad VICTORY be one day swift
To crowne thy sacred head (that art a grift
Extracted hence) with holy Bayes, before
(Vnuanquish'd or vnhurt by sea or land)
Vpon thy brow the Wreath of England sit:
And I with crowned head, but armed hand,
Ride by thy Lordly side, and after it
Turne from thy Grandsires loues to sing thy wars,
Exchanging Venus Mole for Marses skars.
