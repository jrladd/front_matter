Madam,
THere is nothing more difficult, even to the Valiant or the Witty, than making approa∣ches to the Fair: Nay I am confident the most renowned Conquerour, even Alexander himself, if he now liv'd, would rather stand expos'd alone to the Iavelins of an enrag'd multitude, than make his Address to a Beauty so po∣werfully arm'd as Your Grace. The most lofty Wit that ever constant success and po∣pular applause made confident, would trem∣ble to speak before You: Iudge then how

unfit I am, blasted in my hopes, and press'd in my growth by a most severe if not unjust fortune. 'Tis greatly done to raise the de∣press'd, which makes me apply my self to Your Grace, who as You are the Brightest, are likewise the Noblest Object in the World; You enliven, like the Sun, with Vniversal Influence, which induces me to hope that a Beam from Your Grace may reach,
