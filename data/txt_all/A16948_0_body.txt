THose timelesse teares on his vntimely fall,
Who, in his time, bred solace to vs all,
If ought, that's worth the reading, therein be,
Duetie should bid me dedicate to thee.
But since there's nought but sighes, and teares, and grones,
Nor halfe so much of those as fits our moanes.
And yet such as they are, I doe not see,
To whome they rather do belong then thee,
Then thee; whose intrest in his life was most,
And hath by death so deare a Master lost,
As time's vnable to produce his Peere,
Nor euer did, nor euer shall I feare.
For whome I sigh'd out those disorder'd grones,
For Mourners keepe no methode in their mones,
But as the passion is conceau'd in thought
Abruptly, so into the world'tis brought.
Mourning's a naturall motion in the heart,
And scornes to be reform'd by rules of Art.

Then (worthy Knight) such as they are, receaue them,
For were they better, none but thou should haue them,
And when my mourning muse shall change anew,
This sable habite in a brighter hew,


I'le vrge my vtmost vaine, to bring to light
Some worke more worthy of your Worships sight.
