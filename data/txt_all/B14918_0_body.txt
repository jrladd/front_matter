REmembrance of vndeserued fauour, (Right worshipfull) is a present spurre vnto me to continue deserued dutie: in consideration whereof, not knowing otherwise to seale an assurance of my thankful seruice, I haue (after my maner) employed my pen in translating a pam∣phlet, though breefe and compendious, yet pithie and profitable: whiche with wonted will I dedicate to your worship, in hope of accustomed courteous accep∣tation. Prudent and learned was he, by whome it was compiled: puissaunt and mightie, to whom it was presented: pre∣sumptuous and vnskilfull, by whome it is translated: politike & graue, to whom it is exhibited. The first was a Bishop of great reuerence, the second an Emperour
 of speciall renowne, the thirde an abiect of no reputation, & the fourth a Knight of good worship and countenaunce. In∣to whose sacred handes though this my trauell deserue not interteinment, in res∣pect of mine owne person being the in∣terpreter: yet the name of the Preacher by whome it was written, and the same of the Gouernour to whome it was gi∣uen, shall bring to my labour (I trust) suche countenaunce, as it shall of your worship be fauourably receiued, and of e∣uery indifferent reader religiously reue∣renced. The most mightie God and go∣uernour of all thinges, the euerlasting King who hath power ouer life & death, and in whose treasurie are reposed all good graces for the comfort and benefit of his elect, inrich your worship with all maner blessings both corporal and men∣tall, that when the dayes of your pilgri∣mage are expired, you and yours may be receiued into Abrahams bosom, the hap∣pie harborough for all Gods chosen chil∣dren. Amen.
