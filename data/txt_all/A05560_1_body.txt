HAuing dedicated the
former part of this
heauēly Chariot vnto
that religious worthie
Ladie, Anna Carr, La∣die
Balmermoch, your nearest and
dearest kinswoman: I could find none
vnder whose wings this second part
thereof could passe forth so fitly, so
securely, as vnder your name, being

so neare in nature, but much more in
grace to that religious Ladie. Yea,
these my simple meditations hauing
longed and called in a manner these
monethes by-past, for your patroci∣nie,
who is fitter for them then they
can possibly be for you? you being
the scholler of that blessed Maister,
the Spirit of grace and truth, who
hath learned what sinne and nature
is, what Christ and grace is, not to be
the naked hearing of the eare, but by
the inward feeling of a true religious
soule, and well informed and refor∣med
conscience. Sure I am that these,
who had occasion to see and conferre
Abraham after his triall, with Ioseph
after his imprisonment, and with Da∣uid
after he was brought from the vn∣circumcised
land, to the royall crown
of Iudah, could not but find rare in∣formation,
and wonderfull consola∣tion,
resouing them about the con∣dition
of Gods seruants here, and
comforting them against all assaults

could possibly ouertake them, in see∣king
and seruing of him: and shall
not these my simple meditations be
acceptable to you, who hauing lear∣ned
out of Scripture, from your
youth with Timothie, and since your
youth out of rarest remarkable expe∣riences,
what sound, what colour,
what smell, what taste, what touch
things heauenly haue? So that now
you being presented before all crosses
and tentations, yea, before diuels and
death, can from a chearfull heart and
with a smiling countenance, sing me∣lodiously
with that sweetest singer,
that 71. Psalme. I recommend these
my simple weake meditations to
your fauourable acceptance, and
carefull protection, and your selfe
from my very soule, to the sauing pro∣tection,
defence, and consolation of
that blessed God, with whom there
is no shadow of turning, who hath
bene, is, and shall not onely be with
you to the end of your time, but

who shall haue you with him in eter∣nitie
for euer. For the which I shall
not ceasse while I breathe to pray to
God as,
