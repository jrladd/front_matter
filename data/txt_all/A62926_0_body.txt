MADAM,
I Cannot think the ensuing Relation will be acceptable to your Ladyship; for it is an Accompt of the Barbarous Murther of your late dear Husband. Your sense of the loss you have not only demonstrated in your large and bountifull acknowledgments of your thankfullness to such as you found were instrumentall in bringing his Murderes to condign Punishment, but much more by your thus long sequestring your self from the Pleasures and Enjoyments of the
World, continuing in the disconsolate con∣dition of a Widow, like the chast Turtle, still mourning for the loss of him whom it is impossible to recal; whilst your virtue, Humility, sweet Aspect, and resplendent Beauty, render your Ladyship, not only desired, but admired by all that know you.
Thus throwing my self at your Lady∣ships Feet, humbly begging pardon for this my presumption, I beseech God to bless you, and to give you Comfort in your two sweet Babes, the choice pledges of that Conjugal Affection that was betwixt your dear Hus∣band and your self; and that you may af∣ter all the Enjoyments and satisfactions of this World, have the eternal Bliss of that to come; which shall be the constant desire of,
MADAM,
