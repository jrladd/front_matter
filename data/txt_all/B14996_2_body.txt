COnceit not (Worthie Sir) that selfe conceit
Did giue my humble Muse aspiring wings,
To mount your spheare of Mars, affection great
To your great worth, is cause of what she sings,


To you prime Mouer of that martiall spheare,
Wherein so many sparkes of hope do shine,
She first doth sing, in hope your gentle eare
Will giue free way to these Essayes of mine:


Where if you finde ought good, or ought amisse,
Will to doe well in either I haue showne;
If good, or bad, or both, I craue but this,
That as you find it, you will make it knowne:


But (gentle Sir) first deigne to reade: then iudge,
And what your censure is, I will not grudge.
