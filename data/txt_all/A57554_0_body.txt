May it please Your Majesty,
THE Indignation I con∣ceiv'd
at the Reading
of the Author of The Ac∣count
of DENMARK, and

the Rude Affront that is
therein offer'd to Your Sa∣cred
Majesty, has Transport∣ed
me into this Presumption
of Address: 'tis true, the
Performance looks like an Ex∣halation
rising from the Bow∣ells
of the meanest and the
basest Earth; but such Ex∣halations
have often darken∣ed,
and sometimes Eclips'd
the Sun. I might here take
occasion to insist largely up∣on
Your Majesty's Cha∣racter;
but I consider I
speak to a God by Depu∣tation,
therefore my words
shall be few. The more

Brave and Generous among
Your Reputed Adversaries,
confess you deserve to be
Universal Monarch (if the
highest Personal Merit and
Valour may lay claim to
such a thing;) and may
Your Imbitter'd Enemies at
length see their own Errors
by the help of that Light
and Glory that shall surround
You. May the King of
Kings conduct You in the
Right Way, and lead You
on to a just Establishment of
the Nation's Tranquility, and

Your own. Which is the
hearty Prayer of
Your Majesty's
humble and devoted
Subject and Servant,
