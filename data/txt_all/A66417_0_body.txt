Right Honourable,
WHat the terms are upon which our
Church hath stood, with the Church
of Rome, since the Reformation,
and how well it hath acquitted it self in
the matters disputed betwixt us, is very
well known to the World. But notwith∣standing
the power of Truth, and the success that hath afore∣time
attended the endeavours of such as have amongst us
maintained it, we have found by experience, that we have
of late gained little upon them by all our diligence. What
Political Reasons there are for it besides becomes not me
to enquire; but that our Divisions amongst our selves have
been a principal one, and given our Adversaries both the
confidence to set upon us afresh, and also an opportunity

of so doing with greater security, is what no one can be
ignorant of. This is one evident Cause of our present
danger, and what we can therefore never hope to avoid,
without uniting upon some common Principle and Foundati∣on.
It is this that I have endeavoured to point and make
out in the ensuing Discourse, with what success I must
leave others to judg; but which I hope may be the better re∣ceived
as it had your Approbation, and hath now your
Order and desire to have it made more publick. In obe∣dience
to which I have ventured it abroad, that I may
thereby publish how much I am,
Right Honourable,
