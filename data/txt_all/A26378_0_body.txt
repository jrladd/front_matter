SIR,
THE Liberty of De∣dications,
being the un∣doubted
Priviledge of
every Scribler, may save me
harmless in prefixing your
Name to the ensuing Re∣marks.
In which I do not so
much design your Patronage,
because I cannot fansie that
these Papers will be so much
taken notice of as to be que∣stion'd

for their Faults. But
my whole Design on this oc∣casion
is to tell the World, how
much I love your Person, and
honour your Worth.
I will not be so vain as to en∣deavour
to represent you to
the World, or to your Self, for
you are sufficiently known to
both; and your excellent Parts
& Integrity have not attracted
you more honor at home, then
they have acquired you a∣broad.
For I know your Re∣putation
is as happy in Fo∣reign
Countries for the even
Menage of Affairs, as in
your own.

But to attempt any thing
of your Panegyrick, were to
doe, what is done by all who
know you: & therefore I may
justly divert my Pen to ex∣press
my Resentments, that I
can make no Present agree∣able
to your Merit or my Af∣fection.
For which, I have no
other Apology, but either my
Unhappiness, or that this is
not the Age, when Temples,
Altars, and Statues, are e∣rected
to Worth and Virtue.
Nevertheless, I cannot be so
fashionably modest, as altoge∣ther
to Vilifie my Offering,
or so far wrong you, as to ima∣gine

it will be despised as utter∣ly
Ʋnprofitable; for it must
be a Present extreamly mean,
which so great an Ingenuity as
yours, will despise; and a Sub∣ject
strangely dry, from
whence so great a Discern∣ment
can gather Nothing.
I know, that little worthy a
Polite Judgement can be ga∣ther'd
from a Discourse of
People famous only for being
Barbarous; yet if Publick
Affairs can spare you minutes
enough to read over these
Remarks, you may perhaps
in them meet with so much
Order, Civility, and (accord∣ing

to their way) Religion, as
may somewhat refine that
Name. However, if what
I tender may be by you recei∣ved,
as it is sincerely intended,
for an Unfeigned Testimony
of my Respect and Affection,
I have accomplish'd my De∣sign,
which is without all Ar∣tifice,
to declare my self,
