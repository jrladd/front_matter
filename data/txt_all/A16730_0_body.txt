RIght Honorable, my
bounden Seruice in
all duety remembred,
I haue often red, and
heard, which I vere∣lye
beeleeue, that in
the Nature of Man, there is no greater
blot of disgrace, then the vile note of
ingratitude, with which wicked humor,
fearing my long forgetfullnesse of your
fauoure, may make my heart in some
suspition vnhappily to bee touched, I
haue presumed humbly to present vnto
the faire eye of your discreete vertue a
little fruite of my late, and best labours;
VVherein your Ladyship may vouch∣safe
to see, that, although I cannot as I
would finde meanes, to discharge the
care of my duty, yet in my best thoughts

I haue not forgotten you, when in my
daiely praiers vnto God, I doe remem∣ber
you: and, as I daiely and hourelye,
doe hartely pray vnto his holy Maiesty,
for his blessings to light vpon you; so
haue I set downe a few historicall pray∣ers
for you: VVhich, I hope, you will
so finde applyed to your comfort, as shall
giue you no discontentment, in the pre∣sumption
of my paines: and so though I
haue soncke my fortune in the worlde,
hauing only the light of vertue to leade
my hope vnto Heauen, with humble
thancks for your as yet vndeserued fa∣uour,
in continuall prayers to the God of
all comfort, for his prosperous preserua∣tion,
of my good L. your Ladyship, & all
yours, with increase of honour on earth,
and eternall happinesse in Heauen: I
humbly take my leaue in bounden duty.
