MEn to make them∣selues as it were e∣ternall, they write their names on their houses; Absolon reared a pil∣ler, is not this (said one) Ni∣niuie which I builded for my glory, & Ninus to immortalise his father Belus, made for him an Idoll, in whose dominions while Terrah Abrahams fa∣ther did dwell, he became with the rest an Idolater, these

would haue their fame & time ending together, but they haue shot short, of the seauen won∣ders of the world, nothing but naked names remaine: all these are mutilate inuentions, to the Iew departed, his brother or nearest kinsman must raise seed to continue his name in Isra∣ell, but children beeing the Lords gift, could not bee had when & as they would: books, with time that eates all, doth often smoother, may successiue∣ly by concatenation of ages in the Presse as a new Phoenix reuiue, but all these to perpetu∣ity are set apart as faulty. For as they all, monuments, chil∣dren and bookes, are of this be∣low, so shall with the same al∣though neuer so olde bee dissol∣ued, the godly man only and

his name doth euer indure, who hath it, and himselfe also writ∣ten in heauen, and registered in the booke of life, for all con∣suming oblusion hath no place, your vertues and graces make you liue longer then any of these post-running records: but your goodnes for euer, with the An∣tient of daies, to whō I heartily pray that after your period shall bee faithfully finished here, you may be partaker of glory: thus I rest euer your Worships,
In all Christian duty to be commanded,
