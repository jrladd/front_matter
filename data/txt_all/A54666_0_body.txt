SIR,
THis Treatise im∣plores your Pa∣tronage as an Umbrella to over-sha∣dow it, and your Ap∣probation to secure &

support it; so that if its Leaves shall begin to wither, being blast∣ed with any malevo∣lent Censure, they will contract new Sap and Verdure, animated & improv'd with your Protection; it is ready to receive its Death at your Command, and can entitle its Life on∣ly to your acceptance: But, Sir, your Judg∣ment

and Candor are folded up together in an equal complication and mixture; as you have Art to judge, so you have Charity to forgive,
Sir, Your very humble Servant,
