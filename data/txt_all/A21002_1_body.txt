YOur Lordships very name (were there nothing else that did induce me) might he argument enough to make me dedi∣cate this, and with it my owne selfe al∣so to your Lordships seruice: but when by the world (which seldome giues Vertue her due) is added to your Lordship such per∣fections, as made the Heroes in former times so farre surmount the ranke of ordinary men; euer knowing Ver∣tue to be truly Noble: I could not chuse but also inuest your Lordship in these titles, from whence those famous men thought themselues to haue reapt no small honor: and that was in patronizing studious endeauors. Which inte∣rest in you if it may seemerather to be by me vsurped, then iustly challeaged, or rightly deserued; blame therein not my presumption, but rather your Lordships vertuous fame, that imboldened me so farre as to present so small a thing vnto your view: which if you vouchsafe to looke vpon with a gracious eye, I shall thinke my selfe bound for euer to remaine
