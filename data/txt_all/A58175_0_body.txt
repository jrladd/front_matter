SIR,
AFter the deplora∣ble
Death of
that Reverend
and Worthy
Prelate, John
Lord Bishop of Chester, to
whom the Dedication of this
Work was intended, several
weighty considerations indu∣ced
me to recommend it to your

Patronage. As first, that I
might thereby take occasion
publicly to own my Obligati∣ons
to you, and profess my
gratitude. 2. Because having
been much assisted in the Com∣piling
thereof by your Notes
and Communications; you have
so great interest in it, that
it's but equal I should present
you with it. 3. Having tra∣velled
constantly in your Com∣pany,
during my continuance
beyond the Seas, you are well
acquainted with most of the
particulars therein delivered,
and can attest the truth of
them if any one should questi∣on
or deny it. As for the Work
it self, my first design was on∣ly
a Catalogue of outlandish

Plants of my own discover∣ing,
such as grew wild be∣yond
Sea, and were not com∣mon
to us in England. The
English Observations are but
an accession to the Catalogue,
and intended only to help de∣liver
the Press of that.
Wherefore being hudled up
in some haste, upon a deli∣berate
perusal of them I find
the Phrase and Language in
many places less ornate, and
in some scarce congruous. But
my main aim having been to
render all things perspicuous
and intelligible (which I hope
I have in some measure effe∣cted)
I was less attentive to
Grammatical and Euphonical
niceties. The Catalogue I

have had already some years
by me, deferring the publica∣tion
thereof, because I still
entertain'd some thoughts of
making another Voyage beyond
the Seas; and then I doubt
not but I should have augmen∣ted
it by the addition of ma∣ny
Plants, with their Virtues
and uses. But now the Death
of Friends and other Adversi∣ties
that have lately befallen
me besides my Age having cut
off my hopes, and well quali∣fied,
not to say quite extin∣guished
my desires of further
Travelling, I have ventured
it abroad as it is, and submit
it to the censure of the Ju∣dicious
and Candid Reader.
If either Catalogue or Ob∣servations

prove any ways use∣ful
to the Public, by afford∣ing
matter of Information, or
if nothing else innocent Di∣version
to those that abound
with leisure, and might per∣haps
bestow their time worse,
I have what I desire, and as
much as I can reasonably ex∣pect.
But to detein you no lon∣ger,
I am not so ignorant of
my own Abilities, or so well
conceited of any Composition
or Performance of mine, as
to think I shall do you any
Honour by this Dedication;
I rather hope your Name
prefixed will gain Reputation
to my Book and procure it
acceptance in the World. Be

pleased therefore to behold
and receive it, according to
my intention before intimated,
as a token and expression only
of the respect and gratitude
of
SIR,
