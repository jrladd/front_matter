IT was not only the general good Ac∣ceptation you gave this Sermon, when it was Preached, that induced me to publish it, that you might Read that which you heard with so much Satisfaction; But chiefly that I might Contribute my small mite, for the better informing the Minds of you, and all others, in the Justice and Happiness of our present Government un∣der King WILLIAM, and to shew what small Reason any Persons have to disturb that Settlement that by God's Pro∣vidence is now established among us: Which this plain Discourse was intended for. The Fruit whereof will be, to Con∣vince all of the horrible Impiety of those Miscreants, that Combined themselves

together to Assassinate the King's Sacred Person, and by Force and Violence to change the present easie and good Govern∣ment; and thereby to make us heartily sensible of God's merciful Prevention of those Mischiefs, and duly thankful to him for the same: And lastly, to Unite us all together as one Man, in the De∣fence of our King and Laws.
