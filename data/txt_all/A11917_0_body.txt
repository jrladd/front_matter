AFTER THAT I
had waded, right ho∣norable,
in the tran∣slating
of this Trage∣dy
called Octauia, writ¦ten
first in Latine by
that notable and sen∣tentious
Poet Seneca,
& desired, as the com∣mon
custome is, some
Patron, that myght
both bring aucthori∣tye
to thys my little
Booke, and also, if neede should be, defend it from
the bitter taunts of enuious tongs, I haue not espi∣ed
right honourable, any one, either for his boun∣tiful
goodnesse towardes my friends (which cōmon∣ly
men respect) or else for his fauourable, and graci∣ous
humanitie toward schollers (in whose numbre

I am) vnto whome I might so iustly giue this smal
combroustrifle, and especiall token of good wyll,
as to your Lordship: whose honourable goodnesse
or rather magnificence, both your honours nurce∣rie
of learning, and, as I can boldely say, the vni∣uersitie
of Cambridge, with my pore friends, haue
most abundantly tasted of: which your Lordships
most honourable curteousnesse, not to recōpence
in any one iote or tittle therof (which is not in our
small and slender power) but with a well meaning
heart, in some parte to gratefie your honour, I haue
among al other most vnmeete, presumed, both to
employ my trauayle on this trim Tragedie, before
others muche better able, and also to salute your
curteous Lordship, with these rude and vnsauorie
first fruits of my yong study: most hūbly beseching
your honor to accept my good will and trauayle.
Your honours to commmaund.
