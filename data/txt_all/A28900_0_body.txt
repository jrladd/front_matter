RIght Noble, and my much honoured Lord, It is too ap∣parent, that if this or the like spi∣ritual Gold Chain of Dire∣ctions, for the happy Choice
and enjoyment of a virtuous good Wife and Husband, and the De∣claration of their mutual Duties to each other, had been better known unto and observed (after your Marriage) by your late so nobly born Lady; and, no doubt, adorned with a noble and honoura∣ble Education, by her honourable, and truly Noble Parents; in her younger dayes, the too publick, and to be lamented Breach between your Honours, might by God's blessing have been saved. Now to prevent the like disagreement, if God in his most wise Provi∣dence shall grant you a second Marriage-Union, I have made bold, and thought good humbly to present these twenty heavenly Gold-links of Love, as so many
Scripture-Rules of Direction to your Honours & your Noble Ladies Reading, Meditation, and Practice; Pray daily to God for your future Happiness and Contentment, both in your Choice and Enjoyment to the end of your life. And for you, ever to be honoured Ladies, what can your desires be more, or better for this present life, then to live hap∣pily in a single estate, whilest the most wise God seeth it best for you so to continue. And to live joy∣fully, with honourable and truly Noble, faithful, kind, and loving Husbands, when the same most gracious God shall call you to the high and honourable estate of Marriage. The first God hath blessed you with already, living with your tender, loving, and ever
to be honoured Parents, provi∣dently taking care for your noble and virtuous Education, with all things necessary for your present Contentment. And for the se∣cond, that you may be blessed in your right Choice, and happy en∣joyment of truly Noble, Religious, Faithful and Loving kind Hus∣bands; I have exercised my spi∣rit in Reading and Meditation, to find out in the sacred Scriptures, and consider what Directions might be most available to further your (or any others) so great a Happi∣ness; and have judged best, and resolved to bind together some easie Rules of Guidance, both for Choice, and Life-lasting Possessi∣on, of such an unvaluable Trea∣sure in the mode or term of a rich
Chain of Gold, with twenty spiri∣tual Gold-links of Love, more pretious then Rubies, or sparkling glorious Diamonds, of high price and value, with the noblest Lords and Ladies in the World. They are a kind of body apparrelled, not in Courtly attire of silken Rheto∣rical Elegancies, or with Ear∣pleasing words, and delightful Expressions (like some feigned Peices), but presented to your Honours in a plain Country dress, as desiring they should more take the Hearts with Divine spiritual Counsels in them; then the Ear with the sound of pleasing words, filled with fancied matters, which often times prove but loss of pre∣tious time, without any Soul-pro∣fit to the Readers. Now if you
honoured Lord, and you noble La∣dies, please to accept of this Gold Chain of Love, as the Testimo∣ny of my hearty Desire of your true good, both Spiritual and Tempo∣ral, and the best Gift I am now provided to present unto you; I shall esteem it a noble Favour, and continue my daily Prayers to God, for his blessing upon my ever ho∣noured Lord and Lady, your Ho∣nourable Parents; upon your Ho∣nours, and all their Honourable Posterity and Relations, and Re∣main
From my Study in Waltham in Lei∣cester-shire, No∣vemb. 2. 1668.
Right Noble Lord, and ever honoured Ladies,
