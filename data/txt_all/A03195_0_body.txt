NOBLE SIR,
FOr many reason I am induced, to present
this Poem, to your fauourable acceptance; and
not the least of them that alternate Loue, and
those frequent curtesies which interchang∣ably
past, betwixt your selfe and that good
old Gentleman, mine vnkle (Master Edmund Heywood) whom
you pleased to grace by the Title of Father: I must con∣fesse,
I had altogether slept (my weaklines and bashfullnesse
discouraging mee) had they not bin waken'd and animated,
by that worthy Gentleman your friend, and my countrey∣man,
Sir William Eluish, whom (for his vnmerited loue
many wayes extended towards me,) I much honour; Nei∣ther
Sir, neede you to thinke it any vnderualuing of your
worth, to vndertake the patronage of a Poem in this nature,
since the like hath beene done by Roman Laelius, Scipio,
Mecaenas, and many other mighty Princes and Captaines,
Nay, euen by Augustus Caesar himselfe, concerning whom
Ouid is thus read, Detristi: lib. 2.

Inspice ludorum sumptus Auguste tuorum
Empta tibimagno, talia multa leges.
Haec tu spectasti, spectandaque saepe de desti
Maiestas adeo comis vbique tua est.
So highly were they respected in the most flourishing
estate of the Roman Empire; and if they haue beene vilefied
of late by any Separisticall humorist, (as in the now questio∣ned
Histrio-mastix) I hope by the next Terme, (Minerua
assistente) to giue such satisfaction to the world, by vindi∣cating
many particulars in that worke maliciously exploded
and condemned, as that no Gentleman of qualitie and iudge∣ment,
but shall therein receiue a reasonable satisfaction; I
am loth by tediousnesse to grow troublesome, therefore
conclude with a gratefull remembrance of my seruice inter∣mixt
with Miriads of zealous wishes for your health of bo∣dy,
and peace of minde, with superabundance of Earths
blessings, and Heauens graces, euer remaining;
