Worthy MADAME;
HAuing experience of your christian loue, I am imboldened (vp∣on so vrgent occasi∣on and strictnesse of time) sooner to pre∣sent to your view these my poore Meditations, purposed more





maturely to be published, if the vnexpected speedinesse of the Presse had not preuented me. Howsoeuer, my hearts desire is, and (I trust) shall so continue, to glorifie God in my calling, and to profit his Church by any lawfull and hopefull meanes, to the vtter∣most period of my dayes. These infallible comforts of Gods word and faithfull pray∣er (so approued and experienced to euery true Christian heart) I commend vnto your good Ladiship; whose vse (by Gods bles∣sing) may sted you with others, hauing your portion (no doubt) and lot of Tryals in this prouoking world, (a very furnace of afflicti∣ons) to all Gods children. I can promise little, being the meanest of Gods Ministers: Yet will I pray (as my purpose was) that it may proue profitable to your selfe, and such as shall reade it, for the increase of true pati∣ence, comfort, & Christian courage, that we all may fight the good fight of faith, and finish our course with ioy, and so be crowned. I write vnto you as no stranger to my Mi∣nistery, who often haue heard (vpon oc∣casion) the handling of these poynts in the

publike place: Now onely I intreat your fa∣uourable acceptance and patronage hereof, as the meanest requitall of your manifolde kindnesses; And so commending your La∣diship to Gods blessing and protection, I humbly take my leaue: From my poore studie in Shearsby. Feb. 8. 1616.
