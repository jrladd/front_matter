Right Honourable,
THis Geographicall Treatise consi∣sting of two parts, was in the very birth in such sort consecra∣ted to your inestimable Brother, as notwithstanding it so farre reserued it selfe to awaite your Honours fauour, that Both may seeme, as to share a part, so to

challenge the whole in my poore Industrie. The Soule of man which some Philosophers imagine, to be all in all, & all in euery part, seemes to me no where better resembled then in your Generous Fraternity; wherein the Soule of Heroicall Magni∣ficence, though Indiuided in it selfe, so entirely com∣municates herselfe to either, that both may seeme at once to enioy her presence while neither want. If this my bold attempt in presenting to your Ho∣nours hands these vnworthy labours, without a∣ny former reference, might be interpreted intrusi∣on, it were enough for Ingenuity to pretend, that your generous loue vnto our poore Colledge and the respectiue duty wherein the Colledge alwayes stands obliged vnto your Honour, commands my pen beyond manners or ability. Your affection to our house, could no way expresse it selfe ampler then by trusting our custody, with the charge of your choicest Iewell:R. Ld. D. A Gentleman of that tow∣ardly wit and sweet disposition, that Learning and Morality commonly reputed the daughters of time, seeme in him scarce beholding to yeeres, and to challenge a precedency before experience; in so much that our ancient Mother markt out with all the Characters of age and declining weakenesse,

cherishing in her bosome this young darling, seemes to resume her youthfull habit, and triumph ouer Time and Ruines. This happines amongst diuerse others vouchsafed by your Honour to the place, for whose good opinion the best part of mine endeuours stand engaged, hath encoura∣ged my hopes to promise me your indulgent Ac∣ceptance of this slender piece, long since inten∣ded and deuoted, as my selfe, vnto your seruice: In which confidence, fearing any longer to tres∣passe on your serious and high imployments en∣debted to your King and Countrey, I humbly rest
