May it please your Worships,
AS this Discourse, and the Treatise called, The Cry of the Oppres∣sed, &c. and the Supplement to that Treatise, are nothing else but a Vindication of your Worships Actings before 1656. and of the Constant practice of all former Commissioners, for the Excise, even from the be∣ginning of the Laws of Excise. They having, as is very well known, made use of all three Gallons (to wit) of the Wine Gallon, containing 231 Cu∣bical inches, to measure Wine of all sorts, Sope, Oil, Honey, Strong Wa∣ter, &c▪ And of the Ale Gallon, containing 288 Cubical inches ¾ for Ale and Beer: And of the Exchequer Gallon, containing 272 Cubical inches, as for Salt, and all drie things Exciseable. And as the Author hath nothing else in design but a Vindication of your Worships former and present Actings, and the manifestation of Truth and Justice; so he hopeth he shall find your Worships Patrons of his paper labours, to whose serious and judicious perusal he humbly Dedicates them: That so your Worships being rightly informed of the diversity and legality of the three Measures, you may at last return to do your first and best works. As it hath been your unhappiness to be the first who by Mr. Lyons false in∣formations and suggestions, did take up this most unequal Gauge, so it may be your Honour to be the first in laying it down;

Nunquam sera est ad bonos mores via.
