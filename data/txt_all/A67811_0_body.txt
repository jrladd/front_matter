SIR,
AFter Mr. Pearses Command and Approbation, had obli∣ged me to make publick, what (in an accidental con∣gress of some Chirurgeons in London) I had transitorily delivered, concerning the constrictive faculty of Oleum Tere∣binthinae: I soon resolved to address the results of my obedience to him, in a de∣dication to your self; in which presum∣ption I am become encouraged, and confirmed by many prevailing conside∣rations:
the principal of which is, your readiness to undertake its Patronage, and permission given me so to direct it: Motives not much less considerable and important, are your kind and charitable approving, what I have there delivered; the many other favours you have con∣ferred on me; the courtesie with which at all times and occasions, you have treated me; the competency of your Judgment, to licence and justifie my procedure; the eminency of your place (no mean demonstration of your abili∣ties and merit. If the extraordinary in∣tuition of the great Master (especially of men medically professed) and your ha∣ving so long served him, as his personal Chirurgeon, be considered.) And lastly, the benefit of your Countenance and Patronage, to promulgate and credit the Discourse among the military Men of our Art, over whom you have so high an Office, and influence.
These, Sir, were the occasions of my
affixing your Name to so mean a trifle; and these are the sentiments I have of those motives: the former enforced me to this presumption, the latter have ob∣liged me, thankfully to acknowledg your favours, and ever to be, Sir,
Plimouth, July 5. 1678.
