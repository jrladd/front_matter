SIR,
THe Censures and Suf∣frages of the world, are like Rocks and Shelves, against which, Books like Vessels, oftentimes dashing, find their own Fate and Ship∣wrack: Sir, your Acceptance will dispense a nobler, and more auspicious Gale, then any which can be breath'd from the looser or vainer Aire of popular Ap∣plause, to transport this discourse to the publique; And it will be the happiness of this Treatise,

that in future Times it shall en∣title its safety to so successful a Steerage. For indeed the Tem∣pest with Reason, is frequently more destructive and ruinous, then the Storm without it, my own Fear and Caution can secure or rescue me from the danger of the last; but onely your Candor and Approbation can redeem from the prejudices of the first,
SIR,
