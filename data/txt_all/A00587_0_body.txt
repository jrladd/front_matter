strew∣ing
flow∣ers
vppon
the hearst
of Fabiola, said cōcerning her,

VVee haue lost a most preti∣ous
iewell out of the Church.
But since your happy depar∣ture
from the Romish Syna∣gogue,
and repairing to our
true reformed Church, wee
may say on the contrary, in
regard of you, We haue gained
a most pretious Iewell to the
Church. Such lowlinesse of
minde in such height of for∣tunes:
such Deuotion in such
distractions; such constancy
in such temptations, wee
blesse God for, in you; wee
pray God for, in others of your
Sexe and ranke. If to touch
vpon your modesty were not
to wound it, and to relate
your continuall practise of
Deuotion were not to inter∣rupt
it, I should speake much
of it, yet no more then they
know to bee most true, who

are neerest to you, when you
draw neere to your Father in
secret. But because it is not
the least of your praises, that
you cannot endure praise,Fascinant laudando.
and there are many in En∣gland
(not onely in Africa)
who are bewitched by flatte∣ry;
I will drawe a veile before
those eminent parts which
my pensill cannot expresse.
And therfore ceasing farther
to blazon your vertues, I
humblie craue leaue of you
to preferre vnto you a seruant
to attend you in your closet;
I meane THE HAND-MAID
TO PRIVATE
DEVOTION; who vpon
her knee, tenders to your
Grace some helpes to your
Deuotion, together with the
Deuotion and prayers of the
Author to God for you, to

crowne you with the bles∣sings
of this life, and the
blessednesse of the life to
come.
