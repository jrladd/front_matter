FOundations well laid make the better building, and such buildings are best fi∣nished. A begun journey proceedes with travell, and this travell
 is finished with rest. These things, and the like put me in minde of my first entrance into the service of Gods Church, my pro∣ceeding therein, and now the almost fi∣nishing my course. Whereby (Right Ho∣norable) I call to minde how your most Noble Grandfather was the first meanes to plant mee in the Church of Christ, by giving me the Advouson of Chibmarke, a very good Rectory. Your Noble Father with much grace, wate∣red my growth, then dwelling nere his Ho∣nour; And Your Honorable Selfe hath given increase by Your many gracious fa∣vours in the now period of my dayes. My beginning then was with a Comma, to giue me breathing, my proceeding with a Co∣lon, to strengthen me in middest way, and my Periodus makes a full point in ac∣knowledging, that vnder God, and King
 Iames of blessed memory, Your Honour brought me to the place, where now I liue, and in which I desired to be. Quid re∣tribuam? a scholars reward, Thankes, humble thankes: yea and prayers, powred out daily to God for Your Honours health, and for the health of your Right Honou∣rable Brother, and his noble family. And vnto these my thankes, and prayers, I yet adde my true loue, duety, and continuall service, to attend Your Honour, to whose patronage I direct, and dedicate this Booke, knowing that your loue of lear∣ning, your zeale to true Religion, your wisedome in counsell, your vprightnesse in iustice, hath purchased favour both with God, and men.
