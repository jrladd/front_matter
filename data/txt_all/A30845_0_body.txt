MADAM,
NEver till this time could I sus∣pect
that it was an easier thing
for me to be the Author of a
Play, than to write this De∣dication
to my mind; but now
I confesse, so awful is my Pa∣tronesse,
and so humble and zealous my pretensi∣ons
in this kind, that unlesse I could bring an
offering that might far surpasse whatever has

went before it, I should think it too mean for your
acceptance; and for the reason that having been
allow'd, and pass'd the sufferages of the most curi∣ous
Criticks in the Theatre, I should be the more
unfortunate to be at last Shipwrack'd in the Ha∣ven,
by an opinion of my Dedication, whereof
some of the leading Wits in these times have been
censur'd; how hard is it then for a young Wri∣ter
to please this delicate Age, wherein e∣very
year the Wits study the fashion of Lan∣guage
to refine, and alter it, as they do their
Cloathes; and true it is, that 'tis another
thing to write the sence and speeches of He∣roes
that are dead, and make 'em speak as we
please, govern'd by our fancy, then it is to reach
the minds of those illustrious Persons that Poe∣try
is orc'd to choose to be above its Iudges, the
Patrons of Wit: For in our Playes you read
your own Characters, and they are at best but
what we have gathered from you, who daily act
among yourselves in conversation, (in a lighter

Orb) what none of the greatest, and indeed bar∣barous
Courts could ever attain to; and good
Poets are at the best but like bad Painters, that
only shew you the shadowes of your selves, grosly
daub'd, without imitating the least spark of the
bright original▪ With what reverence and
caution then ought I to approach you, Madam,
whose Nobility and Vertue are in the Sanctu∣ary
of so divine a shape, that 'tis an excuse for
all that see you to give their Souls no liberty to
speak or think prophanely of you, but justly to be
confin'd to admiration, and the whole World
will say as well as I, that all that it has heard of
Angels, are to be seen in you, and likethem too,
you are adorn'd with so heavenly a Spring of
Youth, as if you were to blossome to Eternity,
or as if you were indeed the secret Goddesse of
Divine Nature discloss'd, that every year makes
Vegetables grow, and all the Living receive a
hidden and diffusive pleasure from her influence.
You are the greatest blessing the Almighty has

design'd to that incomparable Person your Fa∣ther
as a Reward for his Iustice and Loy∣alty
in that most eminent Place, wherein Hea∣ven,
and the wisest Prince has set him, as the
richest and most adorning Iewel of his Crown,
and a continual and faithful Steward to this Na∣tion,
and no doubt, for its preservation and wel∣fare,
all England as well as my self, does pray,
that he may long live the worthy and indeared
Servant of such a grateful and Royal Master.
To you, Madam, therefore, before I conclude,
I am to beg a protection for this worthlesse Poem,
the product of some melancholly hours, and not of
my businesse: And if perhaps I have in this my
first undertaking, like a raw and unpractic'd Ma∣gician
in his Art, rais'd to my self the envy of
some malicious and troublesome Spirits, which I
have not the skill nor courage to lay, I have there∣fore
wisely invok'd you for my Deitie: for nei∣ther
Criticks nor Devils, I am sure, can pre∣sume
to hurt me in that Circle, which your Name

has guarded and made sacred. Let the mode∣sty
of the Stilemake an atonement for the mean∣nesse
of the Language, and if your throughly dis∣cerning
judgement, and beauteous Eyes, like the
Sun, discover motes and spots in what you read,
you have clemency and goodnesse in abundance to
forgive them, and impute 'em to the inartificial
dresse of a Virgin Muse; in my next she may
appear more curious. I bring in my behalf too
the Conqueror of the VVorld, to lay before your
feet, the greatest Man that ever was, who, were
he living, wou'd become a Rival to his dear
Ephestion, and behold in your Person, as well
the sweet, serene, and obliging Innocence of Pa∣risatis,
as the more lofty and Imperial Graces of
his Statira. This great Man, Madam, the Au∣thor
of the famous Cassandra thought never to
be equall'd, but in the person of the most exqui∣site
of Lovers, him therefore he has rais'd in the
Character of Oroondates, to be a Rival to the
mighty Alexander in the Romance, and here I

have brought him to be so in you, and the rather,
because I prefer him to the likenesse of the young,
hopeful, and gallant Partner of your self, which
I pray he may never cease to be, but early antici∣pate
the extraordinary expectations of Mankind,
and crown you with greater happinesse then
Fame and Fancy have yet created in the minds
of the most Heroick Lovers. This, and what∣ever
increases your felicity shall be the perpetu∣al
wishes of, Madam,
