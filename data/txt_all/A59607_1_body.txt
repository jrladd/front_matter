MY LORD,
I Have little more to recommend me to your Lordship, than that I am your Countreyman and Neighbour; which yet is a Relation that your singular Humi∣lity and Affability is not wont to despise, though in a person otherwise despicable e∣though: But your Lordships Love of, and great desre to serve the Interest of your Countrey, does recommend you abundantly to the World, and does tempt me to speak of it in this Dedication.
My Lord, I intend not a Panigyrick of your Lordship, which they that are acted by a Worldly Spirit, and design Worldly Advantages, might think worth their while to contrive. May your praise be of God, and not of Men! And of God I am sure your praise will be, if you be a Predominant
 Lover of him. I beseech your Lordship to strip your self of all your Worldly Quality bt an hour or two, whilst you peruse the black Characters of a Lover of the World, and the just Motives to the Love of God; and then (whatever exceptions Learned or Witty, or Worldly men may make against these Meditations (which I believe will be many) if you do not judiciously account the Love of God to be the highest Honour and purest Happiness of Man, I will be content how loath soever) to be accounted not to be (what really I am)
