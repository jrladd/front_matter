THe proofe of your Ladiships
vertue hath emboldened me to
set forth this litle worke vnder
your honourable defese. And
although a fault by me is com∣mitted
in making you patronesse of so slender a
peece without your knowledge, yet hoping vpon
your honourable curtesie, which rather respec∣teth
the mind of the giuer, than the worthinesse
of the gift; & poizing the giuers desire to please
and zeale to profit, more than the quality of the
offense, I doo assure my selfe to be remitted of
the trespasse; which maketh me thinke
my trauell not onelie sweet, but
also verierichlie re∣compensed.
