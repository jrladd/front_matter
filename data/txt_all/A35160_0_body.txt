THE Happiness and Well-being of Man
does no ways consist in being possess'd
of much Wealth, but in a Mediocrity;
and in the Enjoyment of the Purity of the Gospel,

and of good and wholesome Laws: And of all
Governments now extant in the World, the Eng∣lish
Monarchy is the Noblest, and comes nearest
to that Native Liberty which Man first enjoy'd;
and God and Nature have laid an indispensable
Duty upon every Man to endeavour the Preser∣vation
of the Municipal Laws of his Country. But
notwithstanding, Humane Frailty is such, that we
have many Instances of Persons (otherways pru∣dent
and wise) either through Pride, Ambition,
or Covetousness, that have had almost over∣thrown
this Noble Fabrick: but it was never in
such eminent Peril as before the late Revolution;
when our Religion, Laws and Liberty, were near
being swallow'd up; and then God was pleas'd to
make his Majesty the happy Instrument of our
Deliverance. But notwithstanding, the Danger's
not over-past; for we have ever since been en∣gag'd
in a great and dangerous War, upon the
Success whereof (under God) depends our future
Happiness: therefore Men would think that all
Persons in Publick Trust, should with great Zeal
and Affection pursue such Ways and Methods as
tend to the putting a Period to the same, and no
ways obstruct their Majesties and the Publick In∣terest;

but scorn and slight all those little mean
Thoughts of enriching themselves, at a time the
Safety and Honour of their Native Country lies
at stake. But through Covetousness the Under∣standings
of Men are darkned, and so see not the
Evils they draw upon themselves and others: And
those who are in the highest Orb, many times dis∣cern
not (having sublimer Thoughts) those things
others do, who act in a lower Sphear. And as all
Governments are incident and liable to Corrup∣tions,
so it cannot seem strange if they have crept
in among us: But ours will be found to be (like
some Distempers) hard to be remov'd; for there
are so many link'd together by Interest, that they
will not fail to support each other, and crush (if
not ruin) him that opposes them. So it's not for
any single Person whatever, to engage with them;
and therefore for that Reason, I have here collected
such of them as have come to my Knowledg:
Which, with all Humility, I lay before this most
August Assembly; whose peculiar Care has al∣ways
been to root out Corruptions, when they
have appear'd formidable and inconsistent with
the Safety of the Government: and that not the
Greatness or Power of any that have abus'd their

Prince's Favour, have been able to protect them
from the just Resentments of the Nation. And
'tis that which hath continued this Government
so long upon its Basis.
There hath been a Notion industriously spread
abroad by some through the Kingdom, (and
which the Nation hath too long imbib'd) which
is, That to make Attempts upon the Mari∣time
Coast of France were altogether impractica∣ble:
Which seemeth strange, it being directly
contrary to the received Opinion of the rest of
Mankind, and the Practice of all Ages; for the
Romans, Carthaginians, and many other Nati∣ons,
that have been strong at Sea, and even the
Venetians at this day, have ship'd potent Armies
both Horse and Foot, and made Descents upon
their Enemies; which have been attended with
good Success. And although the Circumstance
of Affairs may alter and change, yet the Nature
of things never will: But if Men shall land in the
midst of Smoak and Fire, and where their Ene∣mies
lie intrench'd, it's no Wonder if they are
beaten off; even at that rate may the best-laid
Designs be frustrated.

And France hath so strong a Barrier on every
Side, that notwithstanding the utmost Endeavours
of the Allies for several Years past, yet we see
they have not been able to break into it; and
therefore with all due Submission, I humbly con∣ceive
(Humanely speaking) it's impossible of
making any Impression on the Enemy, other∣ways
than by making a Descent upon their Ma∣ritime
Coast with a Royal Army. Certainly there's
nothing can embarrass them like it: the Vicinity
of their Country makes it so much the more
practicable; and England has been the Ballance of
Europe, and may yet, if not wanting to it self.
My Design is not to embroil, but further their
Majesties Affairs, and that all things may work
together for the Publick Good; which hath been
the only Scope and End of this my Underta∣king.
So doubt not but I shall meet with a fa∣vourable
Construction: and if a Publick and
National Interest be preferable before all others,
then I cannot be much out in what I have done;
only must acknowledg to have handled the Mat∣ter
but weakly: Yet the Sincerity of my Inten∣tions
will plead for me, and excuse the many
Defects therein; and so hope I shall not only

find Protection, but a Reward of my Labours,
and Danger I undergo, for the Honour and Safety
of my Country.
