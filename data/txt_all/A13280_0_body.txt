Right Honourable,
THat Eminencie that is in a most excellent Maecenas, to supply the defects and mean∣nesse of an obscure Author; and that Relation and obliga∣tion that a poore Clerk may have to a most
noble, worthie, and respective Patron, hath made me presume to make choise of your noble Lordship for a Guardian of this my poore tractate: which is of a compounded Denomination, consisting of contrary ingre∣dients, of life, and death; of saving and kil∣ling; by such reflecting acts of the doers upon themselves, as make the Agents and patients thereof to be the same individualls.
The discourse is of a mixt and various nature; and the theame of self-killing is the subject both of Divinity, and of humanity; of Religion, and of Law: the full handling whereof may be serviceable to the Kings Majestie, for preservation of the lives of his people, against the blowes and mortall wounds of a self-killing hand: and may be usefull for the publick good of the Church and of the Common wealth; both for the safety of the soules and bodies of their mem∣bers; and also, in point of Honour; that the government of so gracious a King, and the glory of so famous a Nation may not be ignominiously stayned, by self-murdring practises.

In which respects, it was most requisite that I should dedicate the treatise of that na∣ture to such a noble Guardian, as hath a most speciall care to uphold and advance both Religion and Iustice; the honour of the King and kingdome; and the welfare both of Church and Commonwealth, in all the members of the same, as your Honourable Lordship alwaies hath, in the places of your imploy∣ment and residence: which, in cognizance of us in the Ministery, is specially apparent, by your noble and pious care of providing able, painefull, and godly Ministers to the Churches under your speciall Patronage, bestowing your Church-livings, both free∣ly, and to the fittest and best deserving that you can finde for those places; and counte∣nancing and furthering the Clergie, what you can, in all godly and legall courses; whereby multitudes of soules being saved, and the Church of England (under our Sove∣raigne the King) advanced and supported in the Honour of her Ministery, all have cause to praise God, and to pray to God for your Lordship, and for your noble Family, the ho∣nourable
instruments of so much divine and publick good; whereof many blessed soules in heaven (saved by that meanes) are witnesses before God, to your eternall praise, honour and comfort, with your re∣nowned progenitors, of that practise.
And I confesse, it is the dutie specially of us of the Ministery to write your most Illustrious name, and highest Commendations with the poynt of a Dyamond, in letters of Gold, upon the most durable pillars of per∣petuity; and ever to celebrate your due praise, both, for honour of your noble de∣servings, and also for vertuous and pious example and incouragement to all posterity, and noble Peeres, in that poynt specially of upholding and advancing true Religion and piety, both in and by that carefull and con∣scionable course of bestowing your Church-livings, and regarding of your Mini∣sters; and also, by your constant profession of the truth; and, according to the same, pro∣fessedly worshipping the true God; thereby publickly obliging your selfe to such holines of heart and conversation in walking with
God, according to the rules of true Religion; as may give your Lordship sound and grounded hope of eternall life, and may verifie in you the realitie of that most Chri∣stian and heroick motto,
Garde ta foy.
In a word, Divine Providence, and Hea∣vens favour hath made your Lordship Rich; not onely by nature and name, but also in honor and manifold blessings upon you, and in much good done by your meanes, whereby you stand bound to be accor∣dingly thankfull to God; and to be ever mindfull that your Eminency objects your Lordship to the worlds prying observation, and to mens rigid censure, which requires your more carefull circumspection in your whole conversation, that you may be as farre distant from all ignoble vices, and sin∣full courses, (which staines and abases Honour and greatnesse) and as Illustrious in all vertues, and commendable actions, as your noble condition is elevated above the com∣mon ranck of men; which conciliates and
procures Honour and comfort of a higher nature; and of more lasting continuance, than that which can be had from, or by Titles, and humane dignities, or from sycophan∣tizing humoring and flattering, that so you may attaine to eternall glory and happines after this short life ended.
Most noble Lord, I commed this treatise to you, not onely that you may put credit and respect upon it, for publick favour and entertainment, and to give encouragement to the Author: but also, with all observancie, to subject it to your judicious censure; and my selfe to the service of your Honour and noble Family, for the furtherance of the good and salvation of you and yours, by the dayly prayers, and faithfull labours of him that ever remaines
From your Lops. Leigh in Essex.
