DEsert hath no true follower after death
But Eny; others flatter with their breath.
Jn vaine I sought particular Patrons; they
When life left greatnesse, ran with life away.
Blood, kindred, friends, forsooke him; so't was it,
We might haue doubted else his worth and wit.
Their compasse was too narrow to ield shade
To him that both their rootes and fortues made:
But gentle England, since he quiet gaue
To thee by his cares, giue his corps a graue.
And since his wisdome did renowne thy name,
Be thou a Sanctuary to his fame.
And since he gaue for thee his life and health,
Giue him protection, thankefull Common wealth.
