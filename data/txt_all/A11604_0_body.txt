WOrshipfull, If to any thingIsa. 50.4. the tongue of the Learned be necessa∣ry in a minister, it is to the mini∣string of comfort to the weary soule. To most other parts of our fun∣ction, knowledge speculatiue in a sort sufficeth. To this and the appertinen∣ces, only sensible experience. And he shall in vaine temper with a wounded spirit, that cannot subscribe himselfe aApoc. 1.9. Brother and copartner in the same tribulation. The wiles of Satan in this kind, none knowes, but by experience; nor prevents or defeats, except by2. Cor. 1.4. the same comforts, wherewith himselfe hath beene comforted of God. If I said also, experience only makes fit harers, I should not erre. How God hath dealt with my poore soule, either in the wound, or cure, I had rather thankfully acknowledge to my gratious God, then foolishly publish to inexpert men. This on∣ly I say: God is wroth, when he hardens; iust, when he breakes; gracious and rich in mercy when he binds vp the sinners
 heart. TheRom. 8.15. spirit of adoption, is ioyfull: the spirit of feare, dreadfull: but theRom. 10.8. spirit of slumber, most wofull. They are dead that feele nothing; in the way to life, that feele wrath; they liue indeed, that feele Gods loue in their hearts, infused, or instilled by the holy Ghost. I had rather feele wrath, then feele nothing. But Lord how should they loue thee: whom thou hast brought from securitie, to feare; from feare, to feeling & experience of thy favour? But I forget the measure of an E∣pistle. You haue here what you haue felt; the intolerable mise∣ry of a wounded spirit. Balme also from Gilead, if not to cure, yet to asswage the griefe. I pray God the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation, make it soveraigne to your souls: that as you haue felt the wound, which who can beare? so you may tastPhil. 4.7. the peace, that passeth all vnderstanding. Lord Iesus say Amen.
