My Lord,
I Here present your Honour with the fruits (not so well indeed di∣gested and ripen'd, as I wish they were) of some

few weeks retirement in the Country: the more then merited recep∣tion my late Essay upon this great Author found with your greater Fa∣ther, the Right Hono∣rable, the Lord High Chancellour hath en∣couraged me to continue my Addresses to the same Family, of which, after himself, your Lordship is the deser∣ving Head.
I hasten, my Lord,

with my poore Offer∣ing, whilest your Lord∣ship hath leasure to cast your eye upon such a trifle as this; for (doubt∣lesse) you are already in your journey to more weighty employments, for which as well the Ex∣ample as the Precepts of your most wise and knowing Father daily prepare and adapt you.
The truth is, that if you look upon the bulk of the Volume, it is no

more then a Pamphlet, and, by consequence, ve∣ry much beneath the Pa∣tronage of so great a Mecenas: but if you consider the credit and weight of the Author, to wit, Virgil, then I hope, that your Lord∣ship will not receive it under so mean and op∣probious a qualification; however defac'd and mangled by the unskil∣full hand of so rude an Artist, as my self.
Great wits have not blush'd to undertake and publish one single piece of this excellent Au∣thor, of whom every book indeed is of it self a compleat Poem: Hence we have Mr. Sandys his Essay upon the first; Sir Iohn Denhams up∣on the second, and the united studies of Mr. Waller and Mr. Go∣dolphin upon the fourth of the AEneis: I aspire not to the unequall'd Ex∣cellencies,

and deserved fame of those worthy Gentlemen; it is the height of my Ambition to merit your Lordships acceptance, and candid interpretation of this my present addresse, and to beget a belief in you, that there is no person more truly devoted to your Lordships service, and to that of your right Noble Family, then
My Lord,
