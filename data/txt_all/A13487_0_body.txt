ENuie and Hate are such daily followers, and dead∣ly enemies, of the wife, honest, and vertuous, that my hope is, that they will neuer doe you wrong or iniurie: And my beliefe is, that (as you haue euer) you will alwayes carie your selfe so worthily in all your actions, that your best deserts shall neither merrit envie or hatred. I haue heere made bold to present to your illiterate pro∣tection, a beggerly Pamphlet of my threed-bare inuention: I doe assure you that I was more troubled in studying where to finde a fit Patron, then I was in writing the Booke; I thought to haue dedicated it to Beggers Bush neere Andeuer, or to his Haw∣thorne brother within a mile of Huntington: but I conside∣red at last, that the laps of your long Coate could shelter me as well r better then any beggerly Thorne-lush. I did once de∣dicate a Booke to your patronage, of the supposed drowning of M. Thomas Coriat, and I did also dedicate tryce small Trea∣tises to a Leash of Knights; and because you all foure make a well match'd Murniuall of Patrons,A Gleek. (for you all alike very illi∣berally put your hands in your pockets, and to make your monies euen, gaue me nothing:) It makes me the bolder at this time to come vpon you againe, not doubting but your bounty will require

my loue and paines with as much more. It may be that your high affaires (wherein you are continually pestred with needlesse imployments) rubs your minde quite from the Ryas, that you doe not see in what declining predicament your owne sometimes esteemed quality is: for the dayes hath beene that many men kept Fooles, but now (to saue that charge) the most part of such Be∣nefactors performe the function themselues: So that if you take not a speedy order, fooling will bee as common as begging or whore-maisters, and the sight or presence either of your worthy selfe, or any of your long-taild tribe (which was wont to be seene and heard with admiration) will be no more regarded. To pre∣uent which, I would counsell you to make a Corporation of foo∣ling, and that none shall intrude into the society hereafter, but such as shall be Apprentizes to the quality, of which those that are now liuing, to contribute toward the building or purchasing of a Hall, your selfe (during your life) to be perpetuall Maister of the Company. I heare that the valarous Sir Thomas, Knight of the Sunne, hath had such a proiect in his head, end hath pre∣sumed to petition for himselfe, to haue the sole approbation of all authorized Fooles and Buffones. But for aught I see, you neede not feare that he will preuent you in this Monopoly, hee being so farre from the sufficiencie of a generall super-inten∣dant, that he is esteemed unworthy to be a setter vp of the trade: for mine owne part, a Beadles place is onely my ambition, to whip those out of the Society that are malapert fooles, surcie fooles, prodigall fooles, courteous fooles, proud fooles, coun∣ter fait fooles, or any one that is more Knaue than Foole. Apart of Bridewell would serue silly for a Hall, and the Armes of the brotherhood shall be an Asses head Dormant, in a field Gules, with a Bable and three Coxcombs rampant, and two morice-bels pendant, with a Whip passant lashant for the Crest, the Esouche∣on mantled with powdred Vermine. This if you please to take

in hand, no doubt but the worke will be meritorious and notori∣ous, and as the Romane Emperours Nero, Caligula, and He∣liogabelus, are as famous for their acts, lines, and deathes, as the good Augustus, Alexander, Seuerus, and Marcus Au∣relius: So shall you be remembred in succeeding ages beyond the memory of Scoggin, or worthy Will Summers. I pray you be not angry that I doe not salute you with the flattering Epheihites, of honest, courteous, friendly, louing or kinde; for as yet you neuer gaue mee occasion to doe you any such iniurie: I protest Sir, I doe loue you with that affection as is correspondent to the vaccuity of your Worthinesse, and I am assured that at all times you will stand my friend in word or deede, for as much as comes to an vnbaked Tabacco-Pipe. In which assurance I kisse your hand as innocent as the new borne Babe, or Lamb in the Cradle, and shall euer wish you a nimble tongue, to make other mens money runne into your Purse, and quicke heeles to out-runne the or Hue and crie, if occasion require.
He that admires your vnparallelable parts, and wisheth the reuersion of your gaines rather then your Office:
