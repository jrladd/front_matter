MY deare PARTHENIANS,
When the Sauiour of the world
had passed the Torrent of Cedron,
into the Garden of Gethsemani,
there to commence the Tragedie,
whose sad Catastrophe he was to finish on
Mount Caluarie, he gaue to vnderstand, how
much (no doubt) he was pleased with Gardens.
But then especially, after the Tragick Scene was
ended, and that doleful curten or veyle was rent
asunder (a token of the period of the Iewish
Theater) when al was voyded, and he vouchsa∣fed
to appeare familiarly againe to his deerest
friends, in the forme and habit of a Gardener, he
euidently declared his good affection, towards
the Garden of their Soules, which then he came to

cheer-vp and refresh with his Diuine presence,
& to banish the clowdes of heauines, which so sad
a spectacle had cast vpon the Garden of their
harts, when as no flowers or functions of their
soules could chearfully yeald their luster, or send
forth anie special odour of sāctitie, so drowned in
teares. May it not therefore seeme strange vnto
you, if I, knowing the sympathie of harts,
between the Mother and the Sonne, the Blessed
IESVS, flower of Nazareth, and his sacred
Stem, presume heer to personate, and make her
appeare to your viewes, not in the habit of fashion
of a Gardener, which office she rather yealds (as
proper) to her Sonne, but of a Garden, vnder the
veyle of Symbols, to deliciate a while with her
Deuotes, You, deerest Parthenians, yet greeued
and groaning with the burden of your pressures,
for his sake, who is the cuious Gardener indeed, that
from the beginning planted the same for himself,
from al Eternitie. Now then the winter past of
melancholie thoughts, the showers blowne-ouer
and quite vanished, of teares of persecution; I say,
laying the memorie of them al aside, as stormes
already past, in conceit at least, you heer behold
our SACRED PARTHENES, who presents her
self for your delights in Garden-attire and cheer∣fully
receaue her, with serene browes, in this
coorse and rural array, of hearbes and flowers, as
if she were clothed with the Sunne, crowned
with the Starres, and trampling the Moone, as

once she was seen by her holie Guardian, the
deare Disciple, whom IESVS loued. Nor
would I wish you perfunctoriously to view her
only, and passe her ouer with a slender glance
of the eye, but to enter into her Garden, which she
is herself, and suruey it wel. Where, to the end
you may not erre, mistake, or goe astray, in wayes
so new, and strange, and (for ought I know) as
yet vntraced or trod of anie, take heer, I pray, for
Guide, my proper Genius, wel acquainted with al
passages of them. And you (O SACRED PAR∣THENES)
I beseech especially, to guide me
also, while in your seruice I take thus vpon me to
guide the rest.
