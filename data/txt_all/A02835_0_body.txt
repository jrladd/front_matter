Right worshipfull,
THis was once the Preface to Dauids thankes-giuing, What shall I render? & in a borrowed sense it may be mine Quid retribuam? Could I i∣mitate his resolution, I should not giue that which cost me nothing, 2 Sam. 24 (for so I value my best endeauours, when they are counter-poysed with your merits.) I know my dependance & engagements, & find my selfe guilty of too weake performance: yet such as I haue, my piety makes it Gods, and my duty, yours. And I wish the worth of this, which I present vnto your hands, could as easi∣ly satisfie your deserts, as the sight of it wil ma∣ny mens requests. Then might the same fa∣uour, which hath sustained the Author, haue
 greater encouragement to protect the works: Then might I hazard it among these seuere eyes, which daylie scanne our shops and staules: whereas now the number of my Copies shall not exceed the number of my friends. Yet in this fewnesse, I congratulate my owne prouidence, that I leaue my selfe libertie to choose my rea∣ders; which (as nigh as I can) shall be onely such, as either will respect this Taske for my sake, or me for my owne, or both it and me for yours. The very name in my Dedication, doth promise me to be speake some in Dauids com∣passionate language for Absalom, Deale gently for my sake with the yong man. If so, let their loue enioy the vse, & not grudge your deserts, the patronage. Thus while you encou∣rage me with your Countenance, & they with their acceptance, I shal praise God for his mer∣cies, & solace my selfe in your fauours. So re∣sting in hope of this happinesse, I attend you with my prayers, which shall be incessant both for you and yours from
