SIR;
IT was so farre from my
Ambition, that it was
my Feare, to make your
Maiesty (who already is▪
of my Colledge) Vi∣sitor
of my Labours;
for indeed, could the
Honour of this Story have descended to the
humble content of a lower Patronage, I
should no more haue aduentured the Fauour
of your protection, then I can deserue it. The
only credit which I craue from This Inscrip∣tion

is, to countenance, not my Reputation,
but Reason; which tells me, that to vnderua∣lue
the Maiesty of this Story with a Dedica∣tion
lesse then Princely, were to furnish, not
my labours but errours, with a Patronage.
Should I heere steale into a seasonable com∣mendation
of the Subiect of this History, I
should but iniure Goodnesse with some thin
applause; and not, blazon, but stifle Vertue
in too straight a Panegericke: I will rather
leaue still, her Name, for a terrour to the Ro∣mish
Faction, her Death, for a common-place
of Sorrow to the English Nation, her
Vertue, for an example to Your enuious
Imitation, and her vnworthy Translator
to the gratious acceptance and Princely
pardon Of

From my study at Ch. Ch. in Oxon.
