MY LORD,
I Have beene
heretofore very
much ingaged to
your Honour,
aswell for many noble Cour∣tesies
conferred upon mee,

as your respect, and ever
well-wishing towards mee,
altogether unworthie, I
confesse, so great a fa∣vour.
I must heereunto
adde that Dutie, wherein
I stand obliged unto your
Religious and Honorable
COUNTESSE, since my
last being at your house in
Broad-street, for her re∣ally
expressed favour to
mee and mine: As also,
to my Lord of Rochford,
the hope of your ancient
and renowned Family.
But since I am not a∣ble,In Farrag. Epistol
Cum tota mea sup∣pellex

sit Chartacea, as
Erasmus saith of himself,
To requite you with any
thing but Paper; I offer
unto your Honour, these
selected Collections of mine,
not altogether (at your
houres of leisure) unwor∣thie
your view and peru∣sall,
since for ought I know,
not any one of them hath
spoken English before: be∣side,
they are compact of
Rarities, to enable Inge∣nious
and Schollerly Dis∣course.
But howsoever,
such as they are, I hum∣bly
present them to your

Honours Patronage (whom
I know (as many more be∣beside)
to be a true lover
of the Church of God, as
also of Learning, and all
vertuous Parts:) And
with them, my service to
your Honour, and my most
Noble Ladie; who shall
ever be
