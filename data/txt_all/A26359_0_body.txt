SIR,
IN setting so Eminent a Name before so mean a Work, shews that I have as little skill in Dedication, as they have in Architecture, who erect a Stately En∣trance to a House of no Competent Reception. To which Indecorum I was carried by a Zeal I have ever had to own to the World the Honour and Advantage that for many, many Years I have receiv'd from Your steady Friendship. Which was begun in a Foreign Nation, where You added no small Credit and Reputation to Your Own.
I therefore Address You, (SIR) as a Friend, the Noblest Title upon Earth, and come not meerly to crave Your Patronage, but to pay You a Debt. A Debt of Grati∣tude, which as it will alway be Due, so it shall alway be Paid.

But I know Time, and Business, is precious to You, and therefore I will not farther tres∣pass upon either, than to beg Your Pious Acceptance of this Small Treatise, and that You would look upon it as a Pledge of my Grateful Sense of Your Favours, and of the great Zeal I have for Your Eternal Welfare.
And now, SIR, being no Friend to the Common matter of Letters Dedicatory, pardon me that instead of enlarging upon Your Merits I apply my self to Prayer (the Subject of the ensuing Discourse) That You, and Your Lady, and Children, may long, long Enjoy Health and Prosperity; and that the God of Blessings may Bless You with all Divine Graces on Earth, and in Heaven Crown You with Glory.
Lichfield, July 8. 1698.
