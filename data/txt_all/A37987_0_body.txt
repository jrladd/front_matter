May it please your Grace,
HAving lately presented your Grace with a short Essay concerning the Cau∣ses and Occasions of Atheism, I thereby in a manner obliged my self to dedi∣cate this following Treatise to your Venerable and Illustrious Name; for that was but a Pre∣paratory Introduction to this. It is certain your Grace hath Right to both, because you

have shew'd your self a strenuous Asserter and Defender of the True and Orthodox Faith con∣cerning the Deity, and betimes exploded the Vanity and Inconsistency of the Hobbian Creed relating to this Great Concern. And not only before, but since your Arrival to the Metropolitan See, you have signally owned and patronized this Cause which I undertake: and (on the contrary) you have (as becometh your High Place) publickly discountenanc'd, and given check to the Abettors of Atheism.
I profess my self to be one that abhors unne∣cessary Disputes, and loves a Free and Ingenu∣ous Latitude in Matters that are of an Indif∣ferent nature. But when I see the Grand Points of our Holy Religion shock'd by Pro∣phane Assailants, when I behold Impiety and Atheism lifting up their daring heads amongst us, I think my self indispensably concern'd (according to that Talent which the Divine Goodness hath been pleas'd in any measure to confer upon me) to grapple with the Bold and Vaunting Adversaries, to make Opposition to their extravagant Attempts, and to assert and

defend that Cause which is the Basis of all Re∣ligion, the Supporter of Kingdoms, and the Glory of our Lives. This is that which I at present design, and humbly crave your Grace's Acceptance of what I here offer.
But whilst I implore your Patronage, I will not apparently incur Your Displeasure, (and at the same time Injure the whole Na∣tion) by diverting and detaining your Grace any longer: Wherefore I take my Leave of your Grace, and am glad I have this farther Opportunity of publishing to the World that I am,
