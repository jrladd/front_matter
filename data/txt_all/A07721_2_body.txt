IT may seeme strange, Right Honorable, (if not within the degrees of admyration that after many Editions of Horse-manship, published and practised in seuerall Nati∣ons, aswell before the cōming of Christ, assythence, with a ge∣nerall approbation of perfection, and therby growen to so high esteeme, that it is thought the whole world can not discouer a∣nother such, there should be now (by one who hath drawen the longest Line of his life within the Listes and Lymits of an Inne of Court) a Volume of new Inuentions: The Tuscanes do say, that Wittes of inention are Goatish, because they take pleasure and delight to walke alone, and to approach neere steepe down∣falles, and will not follow the beaten path with a Guide before them: But it behoueth that in humane Artes, there be Goatish wittes, who may discouer vnderstanding, through Secretes of Nature, and deliuer Contemplations not heard off. After this maner, Artes take encrease, & men dayly know more & more: for, as Aristotle affirmeth, our vnderstanding is like a plaine Table wherein nothing is portrayed: My selfe seeing all for∣mer Writers and Practisers neuer to haue published the know∣ledge of Nature, Art & Practise of this Subeict, but successiue∣ly to haue troden and traced each other in one path, not daring aduenture to ad any thing vnto that Table, wherein (through want of perfect sight) they thought APELLES Pensil to haue been, esteming all the actions of Superiors to be Rules of action to Inferiors: et quod viros magnos sequi est pene sapere and that the pathes of the auncient Phylosophers are so worne
out, and ouer-growen with weedes that no tract or touch re∣mained to trace or follow them and their labyrinths, so intri∣cate, that no Ariadnes threed could winde him out that was once entred: neuer beleeuing, that Nature had dealt liberally with all the world besides, thought it vnpossible for other to ascend to any higher Contemplation of Nature: although the wise & learned will euer presume to race out that old enuied Sentence, Plura latent quam patent: being written in capi∣tal letters, euen by the hand of Nature in the forehead of euery Creature. And knowing (Right Honorable) the true ende of all mens labours and Studies to be the beginning of the pub∣like and common good of their Countrey wherein they breath and haue their being, without searing PLATO his Prouerbe: . NOTHERCVLES himselfe against two: or . the reuenging eye that is neuer shut, (the necessity of the time enforcing therevnto) I haue heerein, not onely discouered, the hidden Secretes of Horse∣manship, but also the manifest Errors of the Arte and Pra∣ctise: And presuming vpon your Honors accustomed fauours towards all louers of this Art, hauing both the life of the true knowledge and practise thereof, as also the Seate of perfect Iudgement most worthyly liuing in you, to inspire some life in∣to these breathelesse Ghoastes of mine, wherein if I haue omit∣ted any thing pertinent, or admitted ought that is superfluous, I hope the eye of your fauour will winck at my missing: as for the malicious, seing I cannot looke for fauourable acceptance, I weigh not their verdict, onely as the Poet sayth, Equitem mihi plaudere curo. In which hope of acceptance of my ten∣dred Dutye, and pardon of your Honorable Lord ship for my boldnesse, I thrise humbly take my leaue, and euermore rest,
