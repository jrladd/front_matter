Right Honorable,
HOw abundantly the Lord hath enlarged
the hearts, and raised the resolutions of
this present Parliament to serve him, the
many good things, and great things done
by you, sufficiently witnesse, and will be acknowledged,
at least in another generation. It is not the smallest in
the eyes of those that look up to God for you, both in Old
England and New, that you have so readily contribu∣ted
your power, upon the first notice of the manifestati∣on
of Gods gracious work upon the Indians, by an Act
published by you, for promoving the same.
In order whereunto I crave leave in all humility to

represent (having lived some yeers in the Countrey,
and lately came thence) how happily the Lord carri∣eth
on his work there, which I have done in this small
Treatise following.
And for your more full satisfaction, give leave to
remove such false surmises and aspersions, suggested on
purpose to retaed the work. Some are heard to question
the affections of New-England towards the Parlia∣ament,
and present state; To which I must answer,
that the Magistrates, Ministers, and generally the peo∣ple
of New-England, so farre as I know or have
observed, or can learn, have been faithful and cordial
to the Parliament from the first, and do own this pre∣sent
Government, and Common-wealth, giving in this
as a reall argument, in being your Honours Remem∣brancers
at the throne of grace, both praying to God for
you in your straits, and praising God for the enlargment
of his good hand upon you. Others endeavour more di∣rectly
to prejudice the work, by suggesting that the
charity of the wel-affected hath been abused, in that
there is no such work, or that there is a greater noise
made of it in the world then there is cause; To this I can
safely answer, that there hath been, I beleeve in no
mans observation, greater faithfulnesse found in any
businesse, both for truth of relation in what hath passed,
or disposing what hath been contributed; the persons
that are concerned in it, whether they be the Corporati∣on
established by you, or that have the managing of it

in New-England, being persons of known integrity,
and much honoured of all that know them, in this very
respect; Most of these accounts I have seen, both what
monies have been received and disbursed, both what,
how, and to whom. These also are ready to give your
Honours satisfaction about this, if need require, and it
will be an ease, and an honour to them to be called to
such an account.
And now the way being thus cleared, I proceed to
make it my humble request to your Honours, that you
would be pleased to accept of this my humble acknow∣ledgment,
and thankful remembrance of what you have
already done; and that it would not be troublesome to
you to be intreated, and stirred up by my meannesse, to
proceed in the continuance of your favour, as to the
whole Country, so especially towards this work, that
your hands may be still held up to the farther advance,
and perfecting these happy beginnings. And as you have
given it feet, so you would give it wings, that it may get
above al difficulties, which may be cast in the way. Tru∣ly
the work is honorable, and worthy your care, and in∣most
affections, and to be laid in your bosomes, that it
may feel the warmth and influence of your favour, and
best respects, it tending so much to the good of the souls
of these poor wild creatures, multitudes of them being
under the power of Satan, and going up and downe
with the chains of darknesse ratling at their heels. This
I may also say for your Honours encouragement, there is
farre greater cause of promoting this work then former∣ly,

there being more persons, and places which have
received the Gospel amonst them. Our Lord Christ and
his truth gets ground, and the Devil Ioseth, they daily
break from him, and renounce him, and all his cursed
works of darknesse, as you will find in this following
Narrative. And lastly, let me adde but this, The Lord
hath given the uttermost ends of the earth to Jesus
Christ for his inheritance, let therefore your hands go
on (Noble Worthies) to help him in taking the possessi∣on
of his own, who hath kept you in yours with an
out-stretched arme. But I shall be no farther trouble∣some
to your Honours; The most wise and strong God,
for Christs sake, strengthen your hearts and hands, sit
amongst you in your daily assemblings, and help you to
guide the Ship of this Common-wealth, under your care,
in these tossing and troublesome times, that there may
be peace and safety found for such as are quiet in the
Land▪ and let me have the favour to be looked upon by
you, as
