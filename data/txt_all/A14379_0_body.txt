THis Poeme (Right Wor:) being inten∣ded as a promoueing Spurre and incitemen to that most excellent and amiable duty of Gra∣titude, of which, sweetly sayeth St. Augustine, Quid melius animo geramus, aut ore promamus, ant calamo pingamus, quam Graetias? Hoc, nil bre∣uius dici, nil suauius andiri, nec fructuosius ab bo∣minibus agi potest. What (sayes Hee) can wee better beare in our minde, or vtter with our tongue, or set-forth with our pen? than Thanks∣giuing: a man can speake nothing more succinct, heare nothing more sweet, nor doe any thing more aduantageous, than This of Thankefulnesse. I, therefore (most worthy Sirs) knowing my Selfe deeply indebted to your Worships for ma∣ny former Fauours and continued Courtesies to∣wards



me, was duly incited yea stimulated to ap∣prehend this fit and faire oportunity to intimate my long obliged Gratitude, by an humble Dedi∣cation of this small Symboll of my sincere Thank∣fulnesse to your good Worships. Which (had not the malignity of the Times prohibited) was intended for the yeere of your, as pious as pru∣dent honourable Maioralty of this Citty, whose Gates, at this day, doe blesse you (as Ierusalems did good Nehemiah; Nehem: the 13.22.) for your (then) honourable and godly care of the Lords sacred Sabboth. Accept (worthy Sirs) I humbly pray you, This poore Presentation of my obliged seruice (now) for, though it comes lately, yet it comes loyally; and from his heart, who, in all due and true obseruance desires most respectiuely to Rest.
