May it please Your Lordship,
THE following Book be∣ing the History of a Church that was never at any time under the Papal Yoke, and which when its Princes, instead of being Nursing Fa∣thers, struggled hard of late years to have brought its Neck under it; never rested until it had both broke that insupportable Yoke asunder, and secured it self from ever having the like Attempts made again upon its Liberty: To whom can it so na∣turally go for Patronage, as to a Noble and Great Prelate, who had the Courage, when Popery was in the heighth of its last
Triumph among us, in his own single Per∣son to give it the first Publick Check that it met with (a kindness the Church and State of England will, I hope, never forget, I am sure they ought not), and who has furthermore, for near these Twenty Years, made it his chief Study, by creating a right understanding betwixt all Antipapal Churches, to unite them all into one Bo∣dy; that so they may be the better able to withstand their common Enemy, who is still indefatigable in his Endeavours to bring all Churches yet into bondage.
Which Consideration, together with the great Obligation the Compiler of this History is under, to neglect no opportuni∣ty of owning to the World how much he has been beholden to your Lordship; as they have put me upon dedicating it to You, so I cannot but hope, that a Person of Your Lordship's High Birth, and admi∣rable Benignity and sweetness of Temper, will both pardon my Presumption in so doing, and pass by any weaknesses that may discover themselves in the Compo∣sure; and also accept it as a small Testi∣mony of my being,
