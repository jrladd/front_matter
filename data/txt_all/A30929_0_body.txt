EVery Man owes some∣thing
to the Age where∣in
he lives; And as he
will give but a bad ac∣count
of his Life, that hath been
Instrumental to make it Worse;
So he will not be able to give a
good account of it, that hath not
been an Instrument in making it
better: Though Men have their
several Sphaeres to move in, as the
Stars in their several Orbs; yet
This motion should be Common
to all to be doing good in the

World: And the known saying
of that sage Heathen,Cato. To∣ti
Genitum se credere
Mundo, should shame Christians
out of that private Spirit, where∣by
they live only to themselves,
and much more out of those un∣worthy
practises whereby they do
hurt unto others.
And I can truly say, the de∣sign
of this Treatise is for General
good; what success it may find I
know not, or what Censures it
may pass through in this Critical
Age through the weak manage∣ment
of it. But as to its Subject,
I cannot but promise my self fair
Quarter from every Reader, see∣ing
it treats of Principles that are
owned by the Light of Nature,

and such as are approved of,
in the higher Light of Christi∣anity.
My thoughts in the course of
my Studies have been exercised
upon various Subjects; and yet I
could never obtain of my self to
expose any thing to publick View,
unless that which is not worth the
mentioning; And why I should
make an Essay now, and why upon
this Subject rather then another,
I can give little Account, but only
that after my Conceptions about
it had been Communicated in the
hearing of some, it was suggested
to me, such a Discourse might be
useful in this present Age; where∣in
Atheisme is secretly insinuating
it self into the Hearts of Men,

and getting ground Considerably
more then in former Ages.
Not that we have many that
deny his Being, but the Con∣viction
of it upon their Hearts
doth grow very weak and languid,
and the imbred Character of it in
Mens Consciences are much ob∣scured
and sullied through the de∣filements
of sin. Now to brigh∣ten
these Characters, and to con∣vince
Mens Reasons, to awaken
their sleepy Souls, to a Practical
acknowledgment of his Being, is
the chief design of this small thing:
And the smaller, because it is but
the lesser half of what I intended,
and of what I have lying by me
in Papers upon this Subject: And
which doth better justifie and ex∣plicate

the Title, then what is
here presented unto publick view.
But whether I may have oppor∣tunity
and leisure to Transcribe
them for others use, I yet know
not: I find Writing is tedious,
and takes up more time then I can
well spare from other imploy∣ments
that daily attend me.
I have for some time, by the
help of a Friend, had some Medi∣tations
upon another Subject tran∣scribed
into a legible Hand, which
to satisfie the desires of some, it
may be, may in time come abroad,
if they may be of any use; but my
thoughts having been more late∣ly
exercised upon this present Sub∣ject,
I thought method required
they should march in the Van, see∣ing

they proceed upon the most
Fundamental Principles in all Re∣ligion.
And being convinced by mine
Observation, as well as the Infor∣mation
of others, that the present
Age is sinking a pace into the
dreggs of Atheisme, by debauch∣ing
their Consciences, and stifling
the very Light and Law of Na∣ture,
that preach a Deity to all
Men; I thought no better way to
recover it, then to set God before
Men's view in the Works of his
Creation. And from thence to
demonstrate the necessity of his
Being, and the several Attributes
of his being visible therein: And
from thence to gather strength to
the enforcing of that respect that

Men owe to the Great Creator
of the World, and the Author
of their Being: And not only in
those Duties that are Cognosci∣ble
to the Light of Nature, but
even those that are made known
by Supernatural Revelation in the
Word. Specially considering that
the Creation of the World is at∣tributed
to him that is the Re∣deemer
of it; and who is that
Eternal Word whence the whole
Written Word derives its Origi∣nal,
as well as this visible World.
So that I pitched upon this
Subject, not because it is the most
Sublime, but because it is the most
Radical and Fundamental to all
Religion, and most convincing to
the Reason of all Men. And

while I have sought to improve
Natural Light to the utmost ex∣tent
of it; I have also shewed the
Deficiency of it, that no Man
might rest in it. And have con∣sidered
the Creation, not only in its
first state under the first Adam, but
as elevated into an higher state, and
higher improvement under the se∣cond
Adam: Though considering
the smallness of this, I had almost
said, Pamphlet; It cannot be ex∣pected
I should be able to Enlarge
upon any particular herein: And I
was the willinger to Contract, be∣cause
I find few Men can, or at least
will find Time or Money for lar∣ger
Volumes.
Though I have always thought
that good Books are the best part

of a man's Furniture in his House,
and the best Ornaments for Ladies
Closets. Certainly what doth en∣rich
the mind is to be valued far
above those things that only please
the Sence.
And if Men object, what needs
any more Writing, the World is
full of Books; and what can be
more Printed then already is? Yes
verily, new Books in every Age
excite people to Read, when they
will not regard the very same things
in old Authors. And hereby old
Truths come to be newly minted
as it were in every Age, and so they
pass off the more currently with
Men; besides what further im∣provements
are made of them in
every Age.

And sometimes respect to the
Author makes people read Books,
which else they would not concern
themselves about. And it is not a∣miss
to please Men to their Edifica∣tion.
Aud if some Writings do
not match men of the higest Parts
and Learning, let them not despise
them, they may match men the
better that are a degree or two be∣low
them, who have also most
need of Instruction.
And though high Speculations
may please best the Fancy, yet
Practical Writings do best tend to
make a better World. And I
would account it no burthen, but
rather an honour, and advantage
to the Age to be well furnished
with them; if they be not slight and

trivial. It is a mercy to this Nation
that the Press is so open for the pro∣pagating
of Knowledge; for it is
observed in those Centuries where∣in
Popery was in its highest Eleva∣tion
and widest extent, there was
the least written, and so there is the
least account given of those times,
But to Conclude with respect to
this Treatise now presented to this
present Age; If any say, Other
Pens have been Employed upon the
same Subject with it: I would an∣swer,
It is not easie to pitch upon any
Theme that hath never had an exer∣cise
upon it, or, to walk in any path
wherein are not found the Traces of
any Man's foot. But this I can say,
I have not knowingly followed any
Man that went before me; And

though there are some Learned dis∣courses
in the World about Athe∣isme,
yet I find them too abstruse
for Common understanding; and
meddle little with the Practical
Improvements which are to be
made of that which is styled Na∣tural
Theology; which I chiefly
aimed at in this undertaking;
though I have performed it but in
part in what is now Published: Ha∣ving
in a Reserve by me in my Pa∣pers,
an account of those several At∣tributes
of God that are Evidence∣able
from the Works of his Creati∣on,
with Practical Inferences upon
them for the advancement of true
Gospel holiness: But I cannot
reach so far at present. I have
taken some spare hours to Tran∣scribe

these few Meditations for
the Press; wherein I have Inserted
a few Quotations as they did occur
to me; for my Reading hath been
but small: Though it may be what
I have Inserted may make what I
have written not more acceptable
to many Readers: How ever, Prin∣ted
Books being exposed to the
view of all, let every one take the
benefit as he can.
I have nothing farther to offer
here, but to begg of the Reader to
pardon the Errata's both of the
Author, and the Printer; and to
pray that God would both pardon
and amend the great Errata's of
the Age; That the Supreme Deity
of Heaven and Earth, and true
Religion, that is relative to him,

may find more Cordial and Practi∣cal
respect from this present Age;
wherein is wrapt up Mens Eter∣nal
Interess, and the present Interess
of our own Nation. And that any
Essays to this end may be attended
with a Divine Blessing, and par∣ticularly
this, that is sincerely in∣tended
towards it, how ever weak∣ly
managed, by a poor unworthy
Instrument.
