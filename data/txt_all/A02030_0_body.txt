VVorshipfull Sir:
THe remembrance of for∣mer times when I liued at Shingle-hall, the house of the good Knight Sir Iohn Leuenthorpe your Father, where aboue my desert, J found gratious acceptance, and en∣tertainment, hath mooued mee, as in duety to your selfe I am also bound, to make spe∣ciall choise of you, to whom I might dedicate this little worke, but most pretious matter, The Bread of life, Earnestly beseeching the

Lord that as you are a flourishing Oliue branch originally sprung from a noble roote, and truly honoured stocke, so it would please his good∣nesse so to water you with the dewes and raines of spirituall graces, and with this liuely bread so to strengthen and increase you, as that you may accordingly bring forth fragrant & plea∣sant fruits plentifully to God our heauenly father. Amen.
 From Botterwike in Holland, neere Boston in Lincolnshire. 1615.
