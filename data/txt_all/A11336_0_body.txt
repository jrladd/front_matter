REdynge of olde authors and stories my most honorable lorde / I fynde / that mē in tyme past were of lōger lyfe / and of more propsperous helthe / than they are nowe adayes. Whiche thynge as hit greued me / so in maner hit enforced me / to seke the cause of this sodeyne and strāge alteracion. For why / it is written / Gen. v. yt Adam lyued .90. yere. The Sibyls of Cumane liued .iii C. wynters: Nestor .iii.C. wynters: Arganton / kynge of Tartesses .iii.C. yeres: and Galen that famous doctor .C. and .xl. yeres: but nowe adays (alas) if a man may aproche to .xl. or .lx yeres / mē repute hym happy and fortunate. But yet howe many come therto? To serche & gyue ye very true reason herof passeth my small capacite: without I may say hit be / bicause we fulfyll nat the com∣mandementes of almyghty god: whiche to well wyllyng {per}sones are very lyght / and of no burden. For our lorde sayth: My yocke is swete / Mat. x. Psal. 127 and my burden lyght to be borne. Sayth nat the prophet Dauid: that who so feareth god / and walketh in his wayes and preceptis / shal se his childers chil∣dren? And Salomon sayth: O my childrē / Prouer. 3. forget nat my preceptes & lawes: for they shall kepe you & {pro}lōge your days & yeres. And I wyll (saith our

lorde god by Dauid) lengthen his dayes.Psal. 90. Than may nat this be a reasonable cause of this our so shorte and wretched lyfe? Trewely I suppose hit be by our myslyuynge and fylthy synne? whiche beynge so abominable and so horrible / Cap. quia infirmitas de peni et remis. is at som∣tyme the very cause of corporall infirmite / and of short lyfe. Sayd nat our lorde / the phisician of all phisicians / to the sicke man: Nowe I haue heled the / depart thou from hens: and loke thou syn no more / Ioan. 5. lest a worse harme happē vpō the? Or whe∣ther shall I say / yt hit chanceth by our mys diete? and to moche surfettynge? Truely the prouerbe sayth / that there dye many mo by surfet / than by the sworde.Ecclesia∣stici. 37. Accordyng wherto ye wyse mā sayth: Surfet sleeth many a one: and temperance pro∣longeth the life. Surfet and diuersites of meates and drynkes / lettyng and corruptyng the digestiō febleth man / and very oft causeth this shortnes of lyfe.Plin. li. 7 What other thyng but mys diete caused Pto¦lomeus Philadelphus to be so miserably & peyn∣fully vexed with the goute: and so (as hit is writ∣ten) that nothyng coude relesse his peyne / sauyng dethe? What caused Antipater / & that noble man Mecenas / to be contynually vexed with the feuer but yll dite? What other thynge infected Aristar∣cus with the dropsy / but yl diete? Yll diete (as me thynketh) is chiefcause of all dangerous and in∣tollerable diseases: and of the shortenes of mans life. Than hit must nedes folowe / that a tēperate and a moderate diete / prolongeth mans lyfe: and saueth hym from all suche peynfull diseases. And

therfore Asclepiades that noble phisiciā / v. necessa thynges in regiment of helthe. professed There are .v. necessarie thynges to conserue and prolonge mans prosperite and helthe: that is ab∣stinence from meate / abstinence from wyne / rub∣byng of the body / exercise / and digestiō. O howe holsome is hit than to vse good diete / to lyue tem∣peratly / to eschewe excesse of meatis and drinkes?Salerne. Yea howe greatly are we Englishe men bounde to the maisters of the vnyuersite of Salerne (Sa∣lerne is in the realme of Naples) whiche vouche∣safed in our behalfe to compile thus necessari / and thus holsome a boke? But what auayleth hit / to haue golde or abundance of riches / if one can nat vse hit? What helpeth costely medicines / if one re∣ceyue them nat? So what profiteth vs a boke / be hit neuer so expedient and frutefull / if we vnder∣stande hit nat? Wherfore I / consydryng the frute yt myght come of this boke / if hit were translated in to the englishe tonge (for why / euery mā vnder∣standeth nat the latine) I thought hit very expe∣dient at some tymes / for the welthe of vnlerned {per}∣sones to busy my selfe ther in: For lerned {per}sones / and suche as haue great experiēce / nede no instru∣ctions to diete them selfe / nor to conserue theyr helthe. Yet if suche other wyse and discrete par∣sones / as is your lordeshippe / by chance rede this boke: they may {per}auenture fynde that shall please them: and that besides theyr owne diete and cu∣stome of lyuynge / shall be for theyr corporall wel∣fare and good helthe. I wyll nat / nor it becometh me nat / to exhorte your lordshyp / with let of other

your great busynesses / to rede this my powre trā∣slacion: but if per chaunce at your leisure ye rede hit / I humbly desyre and praye your good lorde∣shyppe to rede hit with forgyuenes / and to accept the same as hit is worthy.
