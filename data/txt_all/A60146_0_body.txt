SIR,
I Have herewith sent you the Sermon you desired, and wish it may contribute any thing to promote that Resignation to the Will of God, wherein so much of our Duty and present Happiness consists. No∣thing but the seasonableness of the Subject can be a sufficient motive to make it publick. And while we live in a troublesome and sin∣ful World, and in an Age of Changes, it must needs be seasonable. Could we meet all E∣vents with a prepared mind (which this Re∣signation will assist us to do), we might find a more easie passage through the miseries of this life, to the blessedness of another, than most men do. It would establish us against all our fears, and fix us under all Changes, and
 give us inward peace in despite of the World: It would compose our Spirits, and quiet our thoughts under the vicisitudes of human Af∣fairs. It might be our Refuge in a Storm, our ease in trouble, our light in darkness; and give us Manna in a Wilderness, and Food in a Defart: It would be an Helmet against the approach of Evil, and afford us consolation under actual sufferings: Yea, 'twould furnish us with the truest satisfaction when we prosper in the World. We may then be assured, that what seemeth good, is really so; was designed for our good by the Divine care, and conduceth to it by the guidance of his infallible coun∣sel. If you think the following Sermon may be of any use to such excellent purposes, I pray God accompany it with his blessing. I kiss your Hand, and remain,
Sir,
