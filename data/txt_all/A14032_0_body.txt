WHEN I call to mind (right reuerende fa∣ther) that wor∣thy saying and sentēce of the diuine Philo∣sopher Plato, repeated by Marcus Cicero, the famous Oratour of the Romanes, in that his worke which is written of duties; that we are not born for our selues alone: but our Countrie chalengeth one part of vs; our parents another; our children ano∣ther;
 and often recounting and recording in memorie, the place of the blessed Apo∣stle of our Lord Iesus Christ, Saint Peter, wherin he protesteth, to giue al diligence, not onely to stirre vp the Saints of God, to vertue and knowledge, so long as he re∣mained in the earthly tabernacle of his flesh, and liued among them; but also to endeuour, that they might make mention of those things which he had taught thē, euen after his death and departure out of this life: I thinke with my selfe, & am per∣swaded in minde, that it is my bounden dutie in like maner; (and the dutie of all the learned brethren) according to the measure of grace, and gift of knowledge giuen, and receiued from God, to bend al my studie, to employ al my labour, to giue all my diligence, and do al my endeuour, not only with liuely voice through prea∣ching, but also by writing, to profite the Saints, and benefite (wherein I may) the Church of God, and the holie congrega∣tion of Iesus Christ.
And not ignorant how greatly it auai∣leth, and how singularly it profiteth euery maner of way; in so great diuersitie, and as
 it were confusion, and laberinth of opini∣ons to hold fast, and retaine immouably, vndoubted, and sure arguments of the certaine and vnfallible truth of the sacred worde of God, and most glorious Gospel of Iesus Christ: and knowing no place in al the whole booke of the new testament, either more violently wroung, or more forceably stretched, or more straungely wrested from the minde, purpose, & mea∣ning of the writer, by our aduersaries the papists, the enemies of the Gospel, to the defence of false opinions and assertions of faith & religion, thē the treatise of S. Iames touching the necessitie of good works, in the freely iustified Saints by faith in Christ, and borne againe by the word of truth: I determined at length, & became resolute in my selfe, by the aide & assisting grace of God, to read & expoūd that epi∣stle of Iames, to my parishioners of S. Mari-Colechurch in Chepeside: to the ende that the cōtrouersy betwixt vs and the papists, might the better bee debated: that the place of S. Iames might the more through∣ly be examined: that the truth of heauen∣ly knowledge might more manifestly be
 apparent; that simple and vnlearned men by the plaine deliuerie of wholesom doc∣trine might the better be edified; that all occasion of surmised difference, & all like∣lihood of contrarietie betwixt S. Iames, & S. Paul, might be remoued.
Which epistle I hauing finished, and run ouer, in a plaine methode, in an easie order, in such a māner, as might best serue for the instruction of the simple; and by occasion intimating and signifying so much vnto certaine learned preachers of the citie; they forthwith persuaded me to bestow some labor to put in writing that, which by worde of mouth I had preach∣ed; & to set forth publikely, what priuate∣ly I had vttered to my speciall charge and people: assuring mee, that there would therehence redound and rise profit to the common-wealth and church of Christ.
Whereunto at the first I could not be persuaded to agree; neither might I be brought to condescend vnto their honest request, fearing the sharpe censure and hard iudgement of those men, whom no∣thing pleaseth but that, which is excel∣lent for wit, singular for learning, rare for
 knowledge, perfect and pollished with all varietie of things, and ornaments of elo∣quence: taught in like manner, through practise of time, vse of things, trial of long experience, that in these latter and peri∣lous daies, whereinto we are fallen by the will of God: men flowe, swarme, and e∣uery where abound; which either spen∣ding their owne time in idlenesse, vanitie and slouthfulnesse; either studious of lear∣ning; yet enuying as it were, common vti∣litie and profite; will neither set forth any thing themselues to doe good to others: neither like of the labours, studies, ende∣uours, and trauels of other men. Where∣fore they either teare them with the sharp teeth of bitter backbiting: or stinge them with the venemous tongue of reprochful slaunder: or strike them with the heauie rodde of vndeserued reprehension: or fi∣nally wound thē with the bloudie sword of malicious defamation.
Notwithstanding all this; at length, partly moued by Christian dutie; partly drawen on by brotherly entreatie; part∣ly allured with hope, that by this labour it may please God, that I may winne at
 the least, some one sillie soule vnto the sheepfolde of Iesus Christ: (a labour no doubte more excellent, then to subdue kingdomes by dinte of sworde, and nati∣ons by force of armes: and a thing with∣out controuersie, not onely counteruay∣ling all the trauels of any one man, but al∣so counterpeazing the paines of many:) I consented and agreed to the propoun∣ded motion.
Laying therfore aside the greater part of former feare, and setting at light the cu∣rious reprehensions of those Momi, and malitious persons, whō nothing pleaseth, but what is picked out of their owne fin∣gers ends; framed by their owne braines; imagined of their owne heads, and con∣ceiued by themselues: whose reprochfull censure, who so regardeth, shall neuer bring to light any thing, though it be most excellent, without quarrell-picking, fault-finding, sharpe reprouing, vtter condem∣ning: hauing the publike profite of many, and the eternall glory of God (as the pro∣pounded scope & end of all my labours) alwaies before my eies, I bente my selfe to publish this trauell in writing: not as a
 thing singular aboue all other things: for alas, how farre is it from that? but as a thing (I doubt not) profitable to the pur∣pose; a light to the argument handled, a way to prouoke others of greater talents to the enterprising of greater matters: and a thing I hope helpfull to those that shall throughly peruse it.
Which (right reuerende Father) I thought good to offer and dedicate to your good Lordship: beseeching your honour for your accustomable curtesie, to take well in worth this testimonie of my minde (to speake the least) not euill af∣fected towards you: and hartily desiring you, for your vsuall humanitie, to let these first fruites of my trauell, passe vnder your protection, patronage and pasport. Whom I haue chosen one of many, for this purpose, because at two seueral times, not knowen by face vnto your Lordship, I haue tried and tasted of your worthie curtesie, your fatherly grauitie, tempered with no lesse gentlenes and facilitie.
Since which times, I haue thought (by what meanes I could) to leaue with you some testimonie of my well willing
 affection towardes you. That you might the better know, both in what estimation I alwaies haue had you for your learning, wisdome and grauitie; for your gentle∣nesse, curtesie, and humanitie: and how much I do, & will reuerence you for your godlinesse.
Wherefore if with what my labour, with such profite to the church of Christ, this worke shalbe published: & if I know that it is both fauourably allowed of you, and curteously accepted of the brethren: I will not onely greatly reioyce; but doe promise also and protest, if God will, and if I liue; that this thankefull accepting hereof, shall stirre me vp, & pricke me for∣ward, to the publishing hereafter of other things, in like manner and methode, with more time, with better aduise, with exac∣ter diligence, with sounder iudgement, through the grace of God.
God for his mercy sake giue & grant, that these my labours may bring that pro∣fite which I heartily desire: that all glory thereby may redounde to God, and all profit arise to the brethren. And the God of all grace, euen the father of our Lorde
 Iesus Christ, preserue and keepe you, in pure religion, in perfect peace, in feruent loue, in vnfained faith, in acceptable righ∣teousnes, in reuerend feare, in true holi∣nesse, al the daies of this your mortal life; that this race and course of miserable wretchednesse finished, you may receiue the happie fruite of the glorious gospell, with all the Saints: and be partaker of the vndefiled crowne of immortall glo∣rie, in the purchased kingdome of Iesus Christ. Amen.
