SIR,
I Presume to Present to Your Royal View the First Volume of my Second Voyage into Asia; not so much to give it Credit by so Ambi∣tious a Dedication, as to acquit my Self of an In∣dispensable Obligation upon me to Offer to Your Majesty the First-Fruits of a Work, whereof the Publication is a Debt solely due to Your Majesty from me.

I can sincerely affirm to Your Majesty, That it is the Product of Your Royal Grace and Goodness to me; and that the chief Motive I had to under∣take it, was, Because I perceived it to be a Subject well-pleasing to Your Majesty, being Composed under the Shadow of that August Throne which Your Majesty does so Gloriously replenish: Nor had I taken so much time from the Necessary Oc∣cupations of my Life, to propose it for the Press, but out of an earnest desire to publish to the World the Resentments of my Heart, for the many Fa∣vours I have received from Your Majesty, and my Admiration of Your Majesties Heroick and Tran∣scendent Virtue.
From the time that the Bounty of Heaven had blessed me in the happy Choice I made of establish∣ing my self in this Land of Promise, quietly to en∣joy in it the desirable Fruits of my long Travels, I was alway Graciously received by the late King of ever blessed Memory who as a Mark of His Esteem was pleased to Honour me with a Character of Dig∣nity. And the Nobility, who of themselves are so Affable and Generous, were not wanting in their Civilities to me, to imitate so admirable a Pattern of all Illustrious Virtues.
The most Celebrated Societies in Your Majesties Kingdom, have done me the Honour to admit me into their Bodies; and I was by Soveraign Autho∣rity imploy'd in a most Important Negotiation with the Neighbor-State: But though I received so many great Effects of His Majesties Bounty to me, I am in Duty bound for many Reasons to apply the Ac∣knowledgment thereof to Your Sacred Majesty, which may be comprehended in that perfect Union which Your Majesty had with that Great and Good

King, in participating with him not only in the most Important Affairs of his happy Reign, but even in the least and meanest of his Cares, whereby Your Majesty hath a just Title to share in all the Gracious Acts of his Royal Beneficence.
The particular and immediate Testimonies of Favour which Your Majesty (of Your own Perso∣nal Goodness) hath extended to me, are too nume∣rous to be related; and I am defective in words to describe the Gratitude wherewith my Heart is pos∣sessed in the sense of them: Wherefore in this my Incapacity to express my Resentments of Your Ma∣jesties Benefits to me, I am less able to Delineate those Heroick Qualities which all Europe admire in Your Majesties Sacred Person, and which enable Your Majesty with so much Renown to sustain that Glorious Crown which is deriv'd to Your Ma∣jesty from Your Mighty Ancestors.
I have had the Honour to approach Kings, which pass abroad for the Mightiest Monarchs in the World; but none of those Magnificent Images of Divinity, are equal to Your Majesty in the Divine Resem∣blances of Affability, Courtesie, Vigilance, Know∣ledge and Constancy. None of them ever brought such Consummate Experience to the Government of a great and mighty Empire, or was ever pos∣sess'd with so much Justice and Fortitude to uphold or augment it: None of them have ever joyn'd to the Science of Commanding on Land, such vast and exquisite Knowledge in Maritime Affairs as well for War, as the Art and Improvement of Navigation.
I might advance farther in this Parallel, where Your Majesty has so much the advantage, if I did not find my Eyes dazled, when I attempt to fix them upon Your Majesty.

I have indeed taken the Liberty in the Volumes which are to succeed this, (and perhaps not been altogether unhappy therein) to give the Chara∣cters of the most famous Monarchs of the East: But though my Zeal for Your Majesties Glory is very great, I find my Force at present too weak to ex∣press that of Your Majesties, in so illustrious a man∣ner as the Merit of the Subject requires. However, I may endeavour hereafter to attempt it; and in the mean time I shall continue my Prayers to Al∣mighty GOD, That Your Majesties Reign may be Long and Prosperous; and that Your Throne may be always an Inviolable Refuge and Sanctuary to the Op∣pressed, and Your Scepter as Immoveable in the Hearts of Your Subjects, as in Your Triumphant Hands; and that in the End for an Accumulation of Glory, Your Majesty may secure and preserve an Accumulation of Felicity to Your People.
These are the Addresses which shall be Assidu∣ously made at the Throne of Grace for Your Sacred Majesty, by,
May it please Your Majesty,
