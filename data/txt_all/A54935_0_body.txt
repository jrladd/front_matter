MY LORD;
WHEN about Christmas last I waited on you with my print∣ed Letter to the Author of a Book, in∣tituled, Some Discourses upon Dr. Burnet (now Lord Bishop of Salisbury) and Dr. Tillotson (late Lord Arch-Bi∣shop of Canterbury) occasioned by the late Funeral-Sermon of the for∣mer upon the latter: After I had paid my Duty and Service to your Lord∣ship, you were pleased to take me by the Hand, and would not let me go, till I had promised you to publish to the World this following Narrative of and concerning Ann Jefferies, which I had told you about 15 or 20 Years ago, one Lord's-day at Dinner, where was also Mr. Will. Tom, sometime since Mayor

of Plimouth, and at this time living there, (and is Son of the Gentlewoman of that Name mentioned in this Narra∣tive) who did aver the Truth of many, if not all the Passages I here relate, and will also still justify the same. I doubt not but I could bring several other Per∣sons now living to justify the Truth of what I here writ: Nay, she her self, who is at this time living in Cornwall, must own it, and a great deal more, if she could be prevailed with to speak out. My Lord, I thought I could, if any Person alive, have prevail'd with her, she being the Servant that attended me in my Childhood; but your Lordship may see that I cannot, and therefore your Lord∣ship must be content with what I here publish: And altho I was then but a Child, yet I am satisfied I was not, nor could not be imposed on in this Affair, they having made so great am Impres∣sion

on me from my Childhood hitherto. I know, my Lord, that the great Part of the World will not believe the Passages here related, by reason of the Strange∣ness of them, but I cannot help their Unbelief: Your Lordship knows the Re∣cord where it's mentioned, That the Great God did marvelous things in the sight of our Forefathers, but for all that they sinned yet more, and believed not his wonderous Works: And therefore Unbelief is no new Sin crept into the World. And moreover, my Lord, if Men would give themselves time to think, they can∣not but remember that the Great God has done as great and marvelous Works in our Age, both in Judgment and in Mercy, as he did in the days of old: By which the greatest Atheist may be con∣vinc'd, not only of the Being of a God, but also that his Power and his Good∣ness

are as manifest now as of old; and therefore it's the Duty of all that do by personal Knowledg know any extraordi∣nary Works or Providences of God, which are uncommon, to publish them to the World, that the Great God may be glorified, and Mankind edified; which is purely and truly the Design of publish∣ing the following Narrative.
