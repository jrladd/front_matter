Sir,
YOur Commands have given Being (especi∣cially in Publike) to these Lines; and did I not believe they would pass by the mercy of a Worshipful Perusal, I should never have exposed them to the Criticisme and Comment of such a Censorious Age as this, which under-values most things because they are common; and many things, because they are good. Though these poor Labours of mine can lay no Title to the latter, in respect of their Frame and Structure; they may in respect of their Subject, which is High and Sacred, our very Right and Interest unto Heaven; and so not only invite acceptance, but enforce it. As they are good Sir, vouchsafe them entertainment: The No∣ble encouragements you have hitherto given, and fair Interpretations you have made of things of this Na∣ture, have even fully assur'd me of the same. I have made bold therefore to stamp your Name upon them, that others in our Age may be the rather in∣duc'd to peruse them; and that Posterity also may know, as well as we, that you were one that durst
 both countenance and maintain poor, simple, naked Truth, when flaunting Errour and Heresie do al∣most bear down all before them. I dare assure you it is no small honour to have a fixed heart in such loose times, and stayed feet in such slippery places as your Worship hath lived in, and waded thorow: And it is both a comfort and an honour to, none of the mean∣est, that I can shelter these poor lines under the pro∣tection of one of your gravity, solidity, and other great ability, from the malignity of these erroneous days. What shall I say? God send Truth more such Friends, and they in due time that recompence which the God of Truth hath promis'd to them, and reserved for them. Constancy and Perseverance are the way to it, and Faithful is he that hath promis'd it: To whose merciful Protection I commit and commend your Worship, with Sir Nicholas Crisp your Son, and the Vertuous Lady, the Lady Thomasin Crisp, his wife, for whose sake I was the more willing to engage in this quarrel, and to encounter with this supposed Go∣liah: Beseeching God to crown your life with such Blessings here, as may the better adapt and fit you for the Crown of life hereafter. So praying, rests
