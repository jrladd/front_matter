May it please your Honour, &c.
HAving upon the Revi∣val
of the mistaken
Clamours against the East-India

Commerce, digested
my Thoughts upon the Mat∣ter
into the following method,
I have consented to make
them Publick, if perhaps
they may be useful to Recti∣fy
the Misapprehensions of
some People; and as the un∣bias'd
search after Truth,
will, I hope, excuse me to
your Adversaries, so I per∣swade
my self, the appear∣ance
of that Truth will A∣pologise
for my Presumption
in putting it under your
Honours Favour and Pro∣tection,
which if it may ob∣tain,

as it will be a suffici∣ent
Guard to this Treatise,
so it will be an Abundant
Recompence to its Author,
