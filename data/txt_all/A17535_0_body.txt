IN the feteful tyme
of the sweate (ryghte
honourable) many re∣sorted
vnto me for
counseil, among whōe
some beinge my fren∣des
& aquaintance, desired me to write
vnto them some litle counseil howe to
gouerne themselues therin: saiyng al∣so
that I should do a greate pleasure
to all my frendes and contrimen, if I
would deuise at my laisure some thīg,
whiche from tyme to tyme might re∣maine,
wherto men might in such cases
haue a recourse & present refuge at all
nedes, as thē they had none. At whose
requeste, at that tyme I wrate diuerse
counseiles so shortly as I could for the

present necessite, whiche they bothe
vsed and dyd geue abrode to many o∣thers,
& further appoynted in my self
to fulfill (for so much as laye in me) the
other parte of their honest request for
the time to come. The whiche the bet∣ter
to execute and brynge to passe, I
spared not to go to all those that sente
for me, bothe poore, and riche, day and
night. And that not only to do thē that
ease that I could, & to instructe thē for
their recouery: but to note also thro∣ughly,
the cases and circumstaunces of
the disease in diuerse persons, and to
vnderstande the nature and causes of
the same fully, for so much as might be.
Therefore as I noted, so I wrate as
laisure then serued, and finished one
boke in Englishe, onely for Englishe
mē not lerned, one other in latine for
men of lerninge more at large, and ge∣nerally
for the help of thē which here∣after
should haue nede, either in this
or other coūtreis, that they may lerne
by our harmes. This I had thoughte
to haue set furth before christmas, & to

haue geuē to your lordshippe at new∣yeres
tide, but that diuerse other busi∣nesses
letted me. Neuertheles that
which then coulde not be done cometh
not now out of season, although it be
neuer so simple, so it may do ease here∣after.
which as I trust this shal, so for
good wil I geue and dedicate it
vnto your good Lordshippe,
trustyng the same will take
this with as good a mind,
as I geue it to your
honour, whiche our
Lorde preserue and
graunt long to
continue.
At London the first of Aprill.
