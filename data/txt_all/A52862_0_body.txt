Honoured SIR,
I Am so big with the Resentments of your multi∣plied and repeated Favours, that I am in pain till I am delivered of them in Public Ac∣knowledgments; and have therefore chose rather to expose my own weakness to the World (by making this Discourse Publick) than be ungrateful to you; designing not so much the Publication of my Sermon, as my Gratitude: when (at the Command of our Right Reve∣rend and Noble Diocesan) I preached this Sermon, you were pleased to do me the honour to ride some miles to be an Auditor of it. What was then presented to your Ear, I now place be∣fore your Eye; not that I flatter my self to serve the ends of my Reputation by it: for I am too well assured that those Discourses, which (in the hearing) went down with a tolerable
relish, are often found flat and insipid in the reading, espe∣cially when they are leisurely and critically considered by Per∣sons of Judgment and Understanding. I have read of a young Gentleman of Athens, who being to plead for his Life, hired an Oratur to make him a Defensive Oration to be pro∣nounced before the Judges, which (at the first reading) was very grateful and pleasing to the Young-man; but when by reading it often (that he might fix it in his memory, and speak it with the better grace) he began to nauseate, and grow weary of it; the Orator bid him consider that the Judges and the People were to hear it but once, and then it was probable they might (at the first instant) hear it with as much delight and satisfaction, as he himself had done. This Story hath often represented to my mind the Fate of my Sermon, which is now stript of the Advantages it had in the Delivery; but however I can dispense with my own Credit, and give my self sufficient satisfaction in that particular; because I have sent it into the World upon no other Errand, than to put me into a capacity of making a solemn and publick profession that I am,

Ansty,May 15. 1679.
