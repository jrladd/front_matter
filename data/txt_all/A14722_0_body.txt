Most dread Soveraigne,
I Having had many thoughts of the vicis∣situde
of times, and of the mutation and
change of this pretious Iewel Peace; And
likewise observing how Sampsons Foxes
have swinged about their firie tayles of
disention and discord, wherby this grim Monster (War)
hath violently broken downe the Pale of prosperity in
our Neighbouring Kingdomes; and would subtilly be
picking of the golden Locke of Tranquillity, the which
Omnipotencie (by your Royall Majesties goodnesse and
well-governing) hath been so tender in preserving. And
in regard neither Peace nor Warre can bud nor flourish,
but under the well-managed Sword: according to my
slender abilitie I have spent some few Moneths in dis∣coursing
upon the principall parts of the Body of War,
and that in two respects: First, that some one judicious,
learned, and wel-experienced Souldier, taking a survey of
my defects might be therby instigated to begin and finish
a more excellent worke tending to this Subject. And
secondly, that my fellow Subjects who have not beene
verst in these affaires, might gaine some profit, whereby

they might be inabled to doe your Majestie the better ser∣vice
upon all sudden occasions, when your Highnesse
shall call them thereto. And although it may be deman∣ded
whether Reading or Practice have the first place in
this Art, to be layed as a foundation to this Building;
I must with Marius answer this question, who envying
at the Nobility of Rome (saith) Qui postquam Consules
facti sunt, acta Majorum & Graecorum Militaria praecepta
legere coeperunt. Homines praeposteri, nam legere quam fieri;
tempore posterius, re & usu priùs est. For since that all mo∣tion
and action proceedeth from the Soule, and cannot
well be produced, untill the Idea thereof bee first imprin∣ted
in the mind; according to which patterne the out∣ward
Beeing and sensible resemblance is duly fashioned,
how is it possible that any action belonging to Warre,
can be well expressed, when the mind is not directed by
knowledge to dispose it in that sort as shall best agree
with the occurrents of such natures as are necessarily in∣teressed
both in the meanes, and in the end therof? There∣fore
Speculative knowledge, as the Gnomon or Tramon∣tane
to direct the course of all practice, is first to be respe∣cted;
But withall no man can so well rest upon such cer∣tainty
through the Theorick of Knowledge, as hee that
hath also proved his learning verified by practice; And
in regard the habitude of Arts and Sciences cannot bee
said to be perfectly attained, unlesse their particular parts
are in such sort apprehended, that from the varietie of
that individuality; the Intellectuall power frameth gene∣rall
Notions and Maximes of Rule uniting tearmes of
the same nature in one head, and distinguishing diversi∣ties
by differences of properties, aptly dividing the whole
body into his greatest and smallest branches, and fitting
each part with his descriptions, duties, cautions, and ex∣ceptions;

For unlesse the understanding of a Souldier be
in some kind qualified, and able by Logicall discourse, to
ascend by way of composition, from singularitie to Ca∣tholick
conceptions, and returne againe the same way, to
the lowest order of his partitions, the mind cannot bee
said to have the perfection of that Art, or instructed in
true knowledge, but guided by some broken Precepts;
whereby it will follow that this Science of Warre being
divided into many branches, and consisting in the mul∣tiplicitie
of divers members being all so materiall, and in∣teresed
in the Bulke, that a mayme of the smallest part,
causeth either debilitie, or deformity in the body, so that
every small and unrespected Circumstance, quite altereth
the nature of the action, and breedeth such dsparity, and
difference, that the resemblance of their equall participa∣ting
properties is blemished with their disagreeing parts.
It cannot be denied, but he that is acquainted with most
occurrences, and best knowes the variety of chances in
the course of Warre, must needs be thought a more per∣fect
Souldier, and deserveth a Title of greater dignitie in
the noble profession of Armes, then those that content
themselves with a few common Precepts and broen
Rules; Therefore experience and practice doth not only
make a Souldier worthy of his name; But the knowledge
of the manifold accdents which rise from the varietie
of humane actions, wherein Reason and Error hath en∣terchanged
contrary events of Fortune: And this know∣ledge
is only to be gained in the Registers of Antiquitie
and Historie recording the passages of former aes, that
their harmes may be our warnings, and their happy pro∣ceedings
our fortunate directions; Wherfore according∣ly
(Most gracious Soveraigne) I have indevoured to set
for a Preface to this Warlike-Discourse, such accidents

and occurrences as hapned in the raising and decly∣ning
of the foure most Antient and renowned Monar∣ches;
a subject ful of the varietie of the events of Fortune.
And then I have briefly run over the principall parts of
the Body of Warre; A Subject (if not spoyled by my il∣literatnesse
and inabilitie) fit to kisse your Royall hands;
And like Pyrrbus in Plutarch in silence craves your High∣nesse
tuition; I doe not question your high esteeme, and
gracious acceptance of workes of this nature; and al∣though
these my collective Anima'd versions are but
shadowes to the reall substance your Princely mind is be∣autified
withall, yet may they seem worthy to excite your
Warlike cogitations to visit the excellent treasure of
your owne mind, that thence you may extract particulars
for this war-like age, agreeable to your Magnanimitie
and wiseome, the Ambassage of this my paines is deli∣vered
and discharged. And seeing the Lord of Hosts hath
fitted and inriched your Royall person with the best abi∣lities
of nature, and your Heroyick spirit with true wise∣dome
and undaunted valour; So that in your youth,
your height of courage did venture to plough thorow the
rude Seas, and pace over the Territories of Forraigne
Kingdomes to the worlds amazement, (a fortunate pre∣sge
that your mighty hand should afterwards Con∣qur,
and subjugate both by Sea and Land;) Accordingly
Implore the Heavens to be propitious to your Majestie,
and owne you with Victorie over all your Enemies;
Thus most humbly craving pardon for my great pre∣sumption,
desiring God to bee your Rule and Guide, I
shall be old to conclude with your Royall Motto, Ex∣urgat
Deu & dissipentur Aenimici;
