RIghtly regarded. As I am bound to loue where I finde desert, so I cannot but endea∣uour to deserue where I haue euer found loue. Hence it is that vpon
 reiterated importunity exhibiting to publicke view (amongst other my ministeriall labours extorted from mee) this slender discourse as the first fruits of my loue many yeeres sithence bestowed on you. I could do no lesse then by way of dedication put the same into your hands, and present it to your eies, in the same singlenesse of spirit and spirituall af∣ction wherewith at first it was deli∣uered to your eares; which if it bee worth any respect, in many respects belongeth vnto you, especially be∣cause you had a present propertie and interest therein, as soone as it wtas preached; by the meanes of a reuerend and religious father * a∣mongst Mr. Do∣idge. you, who by earnest intrea∣tie
 obtained then a true coppie there∣of from mee, euen word for word as now it is printed. I could haue been content to alter some things therein to satisfie those which perchance like not the latinisme or vnfamiliar straine thereof; but yet (knowing that he which in doing any thing thinketh to preuent all obiections must lie stil and do nothing) I haue (as you see) suffered it to passe through my fingers vnto your hands in its proper primitiue habit, with∣out any alteration of forme or mat∣ter at all; Commending it in liew of some better present and more sightly oblation to your generall acceptance, seruice, and deuotion; especiallie to you two my especially named good
 friends, as a deed of gift wherein I haue bequeathed some part of the goods of my vnfained affection, which your many respectful fauours haue worthily deserued. I forbeare particulars, least my trauelling thoughts should transport me beyond the bounds of an Epistle, onely in as∣surance of my thankefull remem∣brance of them, I recommend this little Tract of Christian loue to your Christian vse, obseruation, and imitation too; beseeching the God of loue that (by an attractiue heauenlie vertue and influence from aboue) it may powerfull drawe you and others to follow the truth, painefullie preached, and plentiful∣lie professed amongst you) with
 loue vnfained, with zeale well tem∣pered, and a conuersation regular and rightly sanctified, and that you as chiefe amongst the rest, louing each other intirelie in the truth, and for the truths sake, may (as much as in you lieth) like two eies one way looking, and two hands together working carefullie, and conscionably prouide for the preseruation of peace and vnitie, and the propagation of true religion and sanctimony in your well ordered societie and corporati∣on. Thus with my best vowes and wishes for your Townes welfare in generall, and more particular praiers for the increase of all sanctifying graces in you, that amongst the ma∣nie blazing starrès of these daies
 (who onelie make a shew of godli∣nesse) you may truelie approue your selues in your priuate godlie comport∣ment, and publicke gouernment, to be fixed in the same firmament with the Sunne of righteousnesse, and haue your affections so inclined and enlarged to the pursuite and practise of holinesse here, that you may attaine euerlasting happinesse hereafter; I rest alwaies prest to bee proued
