Right Reuerend and Honourable:
THESE two Sermons being thought a se∣cond time wor∣thie of the Presse, I make bold to present to your Lordship. They were both Preached in your charges; the one in that eminent place where your Lordship hath Episcopall iu∣risdiction;At Pauls crosse the other in that famous
 Vniuersitie,At Oxford. where then you were a worthy Gouernour. The one hath passed hitherto vnder your patro∣nage; and the other, being an Or∣phan, desires it. It obtained good ac∣ceptance with that Noble Lord,The Lord Els∣mere, Lord Chancellor of England. who loued your Lordship dearely, and to whom my selfe was exceedingly bound. In regard whereof, I hope it shall finde the more fauourable entertainment at your Lordships hands. The God of heauen, who hath honoured you with many gra∣cious endowments, and made you an excellent ornament of our Church, continue his fauours, and enlarge his blessings to you, for the Churches good, and your owne eternall com∣fort.
