Great Prince,
TO whom should the injured inno∣cence of a Forain & desolate woman address it self but to your Noble and Merciful Pro∣tection, who with the Maje∣stical
Glories of your Re∣lation to this Crown, have most condescending compassi∣ons to the distressed and low estate of the afflicted.
For when I considered the general report of this your Generosity and Cle∣mencie even in the greatest incitements of passion, a∣midst the victorious pro∣gress of your Arms; I could not but presume Your High∣ness would open Your ears to the Complaints of an abu∣sed Woman, in a Case where∣in the Laws are altogether as silent, us in the loudest and clamorous noise of the War.



 Besides, the different neces∣sity of my Cause, and the vin∣dication of it, did inevitablie put me upon your Highnes∣ses Patronage. I am traduced and calumniated as an Im∣postor (and the scandal con∣tinues after all the umbrages of it are vanished) and that I am not a German, nor so well descended there as I have al∣ledged, and do and will maintain: Therefore to your Highness as the sacred and fittest Sanctarie of this truth I have betook my self; whose excellent purity I do so re∣vere and honour, that I would not soil it with the
least tincture of a pretence, or paint of falshood for a world.

Notwithstanding I should


not have been so bold as to have given your Highness this trouble, but that I have been informed you have been graciouslie pleased to pity my ruines, and to ex∣press your resentment of those incivilities I have suf∣fered: And indeed that with the just indignation of other Noble persons, who are pleased to honour my desertion and privacy with their company, is the only support I have against those miseries I indure, the more unsupportable because irre∣mediable by the Laws of this Kingdom made against Femes Covert.

I take not upon me to dis∣pute the equity thereof, but in all submiss obedience do cast myself and my cause at your Highnesses feet, most humbly requesting and be∣seeching your Grace and Fa∣vour in some extraordinary redress to be vouchsafed to
