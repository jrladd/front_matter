I That in seruice yet haue neuer knowne
More then might well content my humâˆ£bled hart:
(I thanke the God of heauens mightie Throne,
My masters fauour, and mine owne desart)
Yet am for you the Champion of good will,
Because I feelingly conceiue your ill.


To taxe their minds to whom we doe belong,
I neither purpose nor desiet much:
The publike multitude that do's vs wrong,
And none but them my vaine must chiefly touch,
In whose rude thoughts my youth is grieu'd to see,
That Seruing-men so slightly reckon'd bee.



Long stood we mute, and heard our selues defam'd
In euery moodie iest, and idle braul:
But now our prize is seriously proclaim'd,
And I become the chalenger for all:
My stage is peace, my combat is a word,
My Muse my buckler, and my pen my sword.


Who treads my stage is chaleng'd, yet not tride:
Who tries my combat fights, yet feeles no weapon:
Who sees my buckler's dar'd, but not defide:
Who touch my sword is hit, but neuer beaten:
For peace tries no man, words can make no fight,
Muses doe but inuent, and pens but write.


Now if my actions prosper, you shall see
Your titles grac'd with greater estimation:
Or at the least we shall no longer bee
Depriued of deserued reputation.
But if my first attempts haue no preuailing,
I will supplie them still in neuer failing
