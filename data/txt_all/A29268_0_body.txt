Right Honourable,
HAving by experience beheld God, and in seeîng God have seen man also, I desire to speak a word or two unto you, as not loosing my life unto the death, for I desire more and more to be transla∣ted and transformed into the Image of Jesus manifested in the flesh, and to live by the Faith of the Son of God in the Spirit. I have now seen man, the perfection of the earths Creation to be vanity, and his wayes to be as mutable as the wind, which is sometimes East, and sometimes West, sometimes North, and sometimes South: and now I desire to lie low before the God of the whole earth, and to lay aside all voluntary humility, and worshipping of Angels or men: I have seen many writings, and I have heard many tongues which have en∣deavoured to hinder the pure flamings of the Eternal God; even the God, the King, and Judge. The pure Scepter is in the hand of Im∣mortality and Immutability, that can make the light to shine in the darkness; so that darkness shall not withstand or comprehend the power of its infiniteness. There is much contending for victorie over one anothers censcience in the world, & the root of such endeavor for a present Conformity proceed from your Synod which you have chosen, who would (if they could) fain be riding on others, and ma∣king the Image of God in others a slave, a servant to their fallible & fallibly interpreted results, whereas the walkings of the visible man
 should alone proceed from the pure power and teachings of the invisi∣ble God, both as to God and to man, (if we walked as he also walk∣ed.) The Gods of the Nations they are all Idols, vanity, a lie, and a shadow, though I remember I have read it was an opinion of old.
Quicquid Humus, Pelagus, Coelum, miserabile gignit,
Id dixere deos, &c.
What ever Heavens Sea, and Land begat,
Hils, Sea, and Rivers, God was this and that.
Me thinks I see sensibly and experimentally (praised be the Fa∣ther of mercies) that the Saints sit by the River of Babylon, and weep when they have the remembrance of Sion, and may yet still do, if the Lord give power any longer to the enemie and oppressor: then they that carry us away captive, will require of us a song, and they that made exile or banishment our portion (as a Synodean Minister (so called) told me there was no other way for Sectaries) will revile us exceedingly, and say, race, race them even to the ground; and they that waste us, will require of us mirth, saying, sing us one of the song of Zion. But if we have not the Lord with us, God with us, How shall we sing the Lords song in a strange Land? Psal. 137.1, 2, 3, 4. verses.
Me thinks it should be a business of high concernment to you to offend one of the littele ones of the Father, (which you may doe, see∣ing neither you, nor your teachers are infallible) lest you be found fighters against God (as God is in Iesus) and crucifiers of the body of love, and complacency. But if you are, and if you are to me, Cru∣cifiers, I desire to imbrace the Cross, as my Fathers Crown to me, I desire to see the Cross, and Crowne, from one supreame cause, pow∣er, and will, I shall be glad if the Father will accompt me worthy (when I have no ground to accompt my selfe so) to suffer for his sake: if you shall have the Crown any longer, yet know this, that your crown, your dominion, is not an everlasting dominion, the people of the most high God shall appear more palpably, as God, with them in the inmost man, and then God shall be palpably exalted, and man dethroned.
The invisible God, and substance, hath carried me out to write these things, and hath answered all objections (though many) of
 flesh, hell, and death, so that to me, to will and to do, is God, so that all, or any thing shall be to me gaine and immortall advantage. In fine, is not particular, fleshly interest, the God of the world: is there, not a generall acting, judging, censuring and condemning, without in∣fallible judgment, and Testimonys and have not men thrown downe Episcopacy, to set up tyrannicall dominering Presbyterie, muta∣to nomine tantum. And is not formall Philosophie, vaine deceipt, traditions of men, and rudiments of the world, the great Argument that swayes, witness many men who write many elaborate Volumes, and the continuall man-teachings of preists to Counsells: do not the Preists of the nation endeavour to blow the bellows of contention; and to divide deare friends, because of difference in judgment, so that as one Augustine, one of they Fathers, Tempestate contentionis se∣renitas charitatis obnubilatur. In the tempest of contention the serenity of charity is over-clouded: may not Episcopalls, Presbyteri∣ans, and Independents sit all under their owne Vines, and Fig-trees, and yet live lovingly one with another, one to another be contraries, & yet be contraries in the spirit of love, and mekeness forbearing & forgiving one another; may not every one walk in the light of his God, according to the prophesie; And the Saints walke in the light of the Lord their God: surely if all that talke of Christ, of that anoinment, were really possest in the glorie of it, man would not be any thing, but God would be all in all: I cannot hold my peace, I am Idem calamo quod in mente, I desire you to excuse me (if you can) that I have been so bold (according to the common denomination of bold∣ness) God hath condescended to speak to me, and I have spoken to God, and his Testmony is sure; why should not you condescend, perad∣venture God may give you an invisible dart, to think on temperance, and judgment to come: So I rest,
