ENnius (Right Worshipful) had
a Maecenas, though his verses
were rude, & Hippocrates durst
present his pictures though they
were rough. The blindest Bay∣ard
hath a reason to shadow his
presumption: for sayth hee, will
is aboue skill. Soothing my selfe
(right Worshipfull) with their
humours, hauing attempted to
frame out an ORPHARION, to harsh to make a
concord in any cunning eare: yet with old Ennius doating
in my youth as he did in his age: I doe presume to present
my rurall Instrument vnder the shadow of your patronage,
and the rather for that as the poore Cobler durst prefer his
chattring Pye to Augustus, for that the Emperour was af∣fable

and curteous, so hearing your Worship to be indued
with such honourable vertues and plausible qualities, as
drawes men to admire and loue such vnited perfection: I
embolden my selfe to trust vpon your Worships curteous
acceptance, which if it be such as others haue founde and I
hoped for, & that any way this Orpharion may agree with
the daintines of your touch and fingering, the end of my la∣bours
and the summe of my desires consort in one
sympathie, and in that hope, I com∣mit
your Worship to the
Almightie.
