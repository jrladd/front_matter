VVHereas now some monthes are o∣uer-passed since my conformitie to the Church of England; wher∣of I haue hitherto beene silent, withdrawing myselfe to further the contemplation of those in∣ducements which lead mee here∣unto; my zeale of truth and knowledge of your great spiritual miseries who liue wrap∣ped in a cloud of ignorance, depriued of the most comfor∣table beames of true Christian faith, working by the heate of charitie in mens soules, enforceth me to dedicate these my doctrinall and morall obseruations vnto your selues, as standing in most need of them. My intention in dedicating
them to you, is no other then true compassion of your soules dangerous estate, not seeing nor knowing your owne erro∣neous doctrines taught in the present Romane Church; of which I dare say many of you are sincere zealous professors with onely regard to your soules health, and the kingdome of heauen, esteeming that aboue all things to bee the chei∣fest to bee sought for in this world, is in truth it is; and therefore your case the more worthie of Christian com∣miseration, and true Apostolicall endeauours for your de∣liuerie out of your so perillous and lamentable a condition, which, according to the small portion of that talent that Almightie God hath vouchsafed to bestow vpon mee, I haue endeuoured to shew vnto you by this Treatise, desi∣ring you curteously and charitably to accept in good part, with no lesse humility and care of your owne soules good, then I do present it vnto you with a sincere desire there∣of, in the most tender bowels of Christ Iesus. Vouchsafe to reade it with deliberate iudgement; examine well the spirit wherewith it is written; weigh the substance and contents rather then the manner or circumstances of my writing; the stile is but plaine and familiar; you shall find no affectation of eloquence in it; because my labours and paines taken herein, haue been rather for the profit of your soules, then for the recreation of your wits. I know well that neither the planting of Saint Paul, nor the wa∣tring of Apollo can redound to your profit, vnlesse God giue encrease and prosper the successe; and therefore lea∣uing the encrease to God, and desiring you most attentiue∣ly to reade these my obseruations, deliberately to ponder them, and effectually to follow them: I most kindly take my leaue of you with Saint Pauls charitable words: Pax
Dei quae exuperat omnem sensum custodiat corda vestra & intelligentias vestras in Christo Iesu.Philip. 4.7. The peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding keepe your hearts and intelligences in Christ Iesus. Resting this 13. day of Iune, Anno Domini, 1612.
