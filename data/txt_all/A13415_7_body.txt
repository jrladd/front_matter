Noble Sir,
THe world suffiiently knowes that you know what Ships and shipping are, that you haue plowed
the dangerous Oean, and furrowed ouer the ragged bosome of Neptune: et neuerthelesse I
know that you haue tooke ntice of my old and wether-beaten Land-Nauy, being built with∣ut
either imber or iron, rig'd nithcut res or cordage, whose Ordnance are discharged
without match or pouder, whose victuals are neither bread, drinke, fish, flesh, or good Ked∣erring,
whose voyages are not performed with wind and water, yet euer in action like aterpetual motton;
 when you shall please to faur me so much as to peruse and suruey my strange Fleete or Armado, you
ill then per ceiue that your selfe hath sayled in (or at the least) borded most of my Ships of note: for you are
ell accquainted with the Lordship, you are a friend to the Schollership, you haue laid the Ladiship
boord, you haue entred the Apprentiship, you are well known in the Courtship, you haue saild in the Good∣fellowship,
you loue the Friendship, you affect the Fellowship, you know the Footmanship, you are
ild in the Horsemanship, you haue surprised and taken the Worship, and you know, that belongs to the
Woodmanship, the Wardship, and Stewardship; I de for some, reasons not ddle th all, and I
inke you haue seldome or neuer had any dealings with them: the summe of all is, I must ; desire your
orships parden, for my alrupt Dedication, assuring you that it was only my loue and  that put me on,
without any expectance of I aronage, protection or reward: and with my best wishes for they perpetuitie of your
resene and euer future selicitie, I rest,
