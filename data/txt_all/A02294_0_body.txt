RIGHT noble & most gratious soue∣reigne: if I should write or dedicate a∣ny thinge, as of my selfe, vnto your ex∣cellencie, with any spark of presumption or singularitie, as a matter meete for the viewe of the maiestie of your sacred per∣son, or sufficient satisfaction vnto the depth of your diuine iudgment: not only mine owne weakenes would bewray me,

and iustly yeald a cruell scourge of my discredite, but also procure my worthie reprehension, and no lesse deserued cha∣sticemēt. But simply presuming of your maiesties milde & accustomed fauour, prouoked by the eloquence of the Au∣thor, encouraged by the profite & plea∣sure of the matter, imboldened because this historie hath beene dedicated by Syr Antonie of Gueuara, & accep∣ted of Charles the fifth, an Emperour of no common renowne, and no lesse per∣suaded by the humblenes of a duetifull minde, as one vowed by othe and alege∣ance to execute my vtter seruice in eue∣ry exployt to your Maiestie: the regard whereof not leadeth but cōstraineth (al∣though with blushing & bashfull face) to present vnto your magnificēce this my simple trauell, translated out of Spa∣nish into the Englishe tongue, contey∣ning

the liues of tenne Emperours of Rome, namely, Traiane Coceius, A∣drian, Antoninus Pius, Cōmodus, Pertinax, Iulianus, Seuerus, Bassia∣nus, Heliogabalus, & Alexander Se∣uerus: whose liues, gouernements, ends and conclusions, giue foorth matter so meete for the spectacle of princes, as wel the vertuous of the one part to take sure direction, & good counsell to their great comfort, thereby as a sounding lead, to obteine knowledge both of the depth & coast, to lead thēselues into all safetie of bodie and minde: as also the licentious, on the other part, to moderate and staye their rash attemptes, as a sheat anchore in all furious stormes of perplexities, to saue from shipwracke both life and ho∣nour. All which being considered, in respect that the matter therin cōteyned, treateth of Kings and Emperours, and

hath beene dedicated vnto an Empe∣rour: the woorke of it selfe craueth your milde acceptation, as onely due vnto the souereigntie of your Maiesties estate, to escape the infamie of abasement. I your Maiesties most humble and loyall ser∣uaunt, in most humble wise beseeching, that of your great mildnes and clemen∣cie, it may like your highnesse to accept this my simple present, full fraught, not of skill, but of loyaltie: wherein, for as much as the Authour in the front here∣of, hath fixed so worthy a prologue, that there seemeth nothing to be omitted, or that any thing might be added: yeldeth iust cause to cease further to vrge your patience with tediousnes: most humbly beseeching your Maiestie, that it maye please the same of your great bountie to pardon all my defectes that herein may appeare: and I your Maiesties most hū∣ble

and obedient seruaunt, shall neuer cease to pray, that the blessing of the li∣uing GOD, may alwayes conduct & follow your Maiestie, with all perfect felicitie, both of bodie and soule, as may yeeld your Maiestie immortal fame be∣fore God and man.
