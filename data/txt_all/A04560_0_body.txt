THE generall report and considera∣tion (right Worshipfull) of your exceeding courtesie, and the great friendship which my parents haue heretofore found at the hands of your renowned Father doe imbol∣den me to present vnto your Wor∣ship these my vnpolisht Labours; which if you shall vouchsafe to cast a fauourable glaunce vpon, and therin find any part or parcell pleasing to your vertuous minde, I shall esteeme my trauell most highly honoured. The History (I present) you shall finde de∣lightfull, the matter not offensiue to any: only my skil in penning it very simply, and my presumption great, in pre∣senting so rude a peece of worke to so wise a Patron; which I hope your Worship will the more beare with, and accompt the rather to be pardonable, in that the fault proceedeth from a good meaning.
