Dread Soueraigne:
IN this ge∣nerall time of giuing and receiuing, I bethought my selfe of some fit Pre∣sent to giue your Ma∣iesty,Qui cogitat de recipien∣do. though without hope of receiuing; theSeneca de Benef. lesse subiect am I, to be∣ing deceiued: The exi∣lity of my place excuseth
 me from giuing as others giue; and my not giuing, excludes from receiuing a peece of Plate as o∣thers of my place giue, and receiue: I hearti∣ly wish that I were one of them, and (herein I shal easily be beleeued;) with equall zeale I de∣sire your Maiesties gra∣cious acceptance hereof, and 'tis all I will beg at this time, or hope to re∣ceiue, your Maiesties
 beleefe in this. Ma∣ny old Sermons I had lying by me preached at Court, (more then any Chaplaine, time for time) none of them would serue to make a New-yeares Gift of. This is one neuer prea∣ched; which I am bold to send (after six yeeres silence lying fallow) and not comming vp to Be∣thel, because not called thither) as a lasting ac∣knowledgement
 of what I haue receiued, what I owe. As Peter said, Siluer and gold haue I none, such as I haue, I giue, or rather Render: And to whom more fit∣ly should I dedicate The Earths encrease; then to the King of Peace and plenty? to whom a Sermon, then to a Prince, so great a lo∣uer of Sermons, prefer∣rer of Preachers; so a∣ble
 to iudge of both?
By this your Maie∣stie shall be a great gay∣ner, quia nihil inde deducitur, your Ma∣iestie receiues without giuing: I no looser; if it gaine your Maiesties iudicious approbation of it selfe, & the Author, who dayly praies for the long continuance of your Maiesties happy raign ouer vs; vnder which, we haue so long enioyed
 peace, plenty, and the Gospel; and so humbly rests.
