SIR,
I Have many thanks to give you for the
Book you pleased to send me, called The
Popish Royall Favorite; and accor∣ding
to your advice (which I value in a
high degree) I put Pen to Paper, and
some thing you may see I have don (though
in a poor Pamphleting way) to clear my
self of those aspersions that are cast upon
me therin. But truly Sir, I was never so
unfit for such a task; al my papers, Manu∣scripts,
and Notes, having been long since
seized upon and kept from me. Add here∣unto,
that besides this long pressure and
languishment of twenty three moneths close
restraint (the sense whereof, I find hath
much stupified my spirits) it pleased God
to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of
sicknes, a high burning Fever, with the

new Disease, wherof my Body as well as
my Mind, is yet somwhat crazy: So that
(take all afflictions together) I may truly
say, I have passed the Ordeal, the fiery
Tryal. But it hath pleased God to reprieve
me to see better days I hope; for out of
this fatal black Cloud, which now oresets
this poor Island, I hope ther will break a
glorious Sun-shine of peace and firm hap∣pines:
To effect which, had I a Jury, a
Grand-Jury of lives, I would sacrifice
them all, and triumph in the oblation.
So I most affectionately kisse your
hands, and rest
From the Prison of the Fleet.
