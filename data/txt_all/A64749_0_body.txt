My Lord,
THough Dedications are now become a kind of Tyranny over the Peace and Repose of great Men; yet I have confidence I shall so manage the present Address as to en∣tertain your Lordship without much distur∣bance; and because my purposes are go∣vern'd by deep Respect and Veneration, I hope to find your Lordship more facile

and accessible. And I am already absolv'd from a great part of that fulsome and de∣signing guilt, being sufficiently remov'd from the causes of it: for I consider, my Lord! that you are already so well known to the World in your several Characters, and advantages of Honour; it was yours by traduction, and the adjunct of your Nativity, you were swaddl'd and rock'd in't, bred up and grew in't to your now wonderful height and eminence: that for me under pretence of the inscription to give you the heraldry of your family, or to carry your person through the fam'd To∣picks of Mind Body, or Estate, were all one as to perswade the World that Fire and Light were very bright Bodies, or that the Luminaries themselves had Glory. In point of Protection I beg to fall in with the common wont, and to be satisfied by the reasonableness of the thing, and abun∣dant worthy precedents; and although I should have secret prophecy and assurance that the ensuing Verse would live eternally, yet would I, as I now do, humbly crave it might be fortifi'd with your Patronage; for so the Sextile Aspects and Influences

are watch'd for, and applied to the actions of Life, thereby to make the Scheme and good Auguries of the Birth pass into Fate, and a success infallible.
My Lord! By a happy obliging Inter∣cession, and your own consequent Iudul∣gence, I have now recourse to your Lord∣ship; hopeing, I shall not much displease by putting these Twin Poets into your Hands. The Minion and Vertical Planet of the Roman Lustre and Bravery was ne∣ver better pleased, than when he had a whole Constellation about him: not his finishing Five several Wars to the promo∣ting of his own Interest, nor particularly the prodigious success at Actium, where he held in chase the Wealth, Beauty and Prowess of the East; not the Triumphs and absolute Dominions which followed, all this gave him not half that serene Pride and Satisfaction of Spirit as when he retir'd himself to umpire the different Excellencies of his insipid Friends, and to distribute Lawrels among his Poetick Heroes: If now upon the Authority of this, and several such Examples I had the Ability and Op∣portunity

of drawing the Value and strange Worth of a Poet, and withall of applying some of the Lineaments to the following pieces; I should then do my self a real Service, and attone in a great measure for the present insolence. But best of all will it serve my Defence and Interest to appeal to your Lordships own conceptions and image of Genuine Verse; with which so just, so regular Original, if these Copies shall hold proportion and resemblance, then am I advanced very far in your Lord∣ships pardon: the rest will entirely be sup∣plied me by your Lordships Goodness, and my own awful Zeal of being,
My Lord!
