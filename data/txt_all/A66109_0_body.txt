My LORD;
THIS Appeal which Ad∣dresses
it self to Others
for their Judgment,
Sues, with all Humility, to Your
Grace for Your Protection; and
that such, as, I conceive, is neither
Unfit for me to Ask, nor for Your
Grace to Afford. You will here
see what that true Agreement is be∣tween

the Priesthood and the Em∣pire,
which our Laws have Esta∣blish'd;
our Convocations ap∣prov'd
of; and our Greatest Cler∣gy-men
hitherto defended; with∣out
the Censure of Any, but the pro∣fess'd
Enemies of our Church and
Constitution. But now a New
Sort of Disciplinarians are risen
up from within our selves, who
seem to comply with the Govern∣ment
of the Church, much upon
the same account that Others do
with that of the State; not out of
Conscience to their Duty, or any
Love they have for it; but because
it is the Establish'd Church,
and they cannot keep their Prefer∣ments
without it. They hate our
Constitution, and Revile all such
as stand up in Good Earnest for
it: but, for all that, they resolve
to hold fast to it; and go on still to
Subscribe, and Rail.

IN Opposition either to the Er∣rors
or Designs of these Men, the
Present Appeal bespeaks Your
Grace's Protection, not so much
for its self, as for the Articles
and Canons of our Church;
and for those Excellent Worthies
who, in their several Successions,
have appear'd in Defence of the
King's Supremacy over the State
Ecclesiastical, as by Law de∣clared,
and Establish'd. That
you will vouchsafe still to Continue
to Own a Cause, in which not only
the Church of England, but the
Church Catholick, ever since the
Civil Powers have become Chri∣stian,
is concern'd together with
her: The Authority we plead for
in behalf of our Kings, being no
Other than what the most famous
Bishops and Councils of the
Church have given to their Empe∣perors;

and who, by consequence,
must All be involved in the same
Censure with our Parliaments and
Convocations. And they who
now Revile the One, would as free∣ly
Condemn the Other, but that
they are sensible that many who are
well content with the Reproach of
King Henry VIII. and his Cler∣gy,
would not endure to hear the
like Charges made against Constan∣tine
and Theodosius; and those
Bishops and Councils which all
Christians, in all Ages, have
been wont to pay so Great a Re∣gard
to.
THIS, My LORD, is
the Cause which I here bring be∣fore
Your Grace: In the Defence
whereof I have Once already been
engaged, and shall, with God's As∣sistance,
again appear; when those

who now talk with such Confidence
against my former Allegations,
shall give me Occasion to shew how
just they were, and how little, in
Reality, there is to be excepted a∣gainst
them. In the mean time, I
was willing, for the better Disco∣very
of these New-Reformers;
by this short, preliminany Treatise,
to draw aside the Curtain, and let
the World see whose Off-spring
they are, and from whom they de∣rive
both their Principles, and
their Animosities, against Us. I
cannot but hope, that by this I shall
awaken all the Sincere Members
of our Church to beware of them;
and not give Countenance to such
Attempts, as under a shew of bet∣tering
Our Constitution, do in
Reality tend to the Utter Sub∣version
of it. To Your Grace I
submit both the Design and the

Performance; and with all pos∣sible
Duty and Respect Remain,
My LORD,
