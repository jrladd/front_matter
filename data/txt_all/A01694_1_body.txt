THe loue (most honor'd Lady) that I owe
To your high vertues, cannot be confin'd
In words or phrases: nor can paper showe
The obiect-lesse endeuours of my mind.
How then shall any (though the purest spirit,
That sucks the seau'n-fold flower of art) expresse
The genuine glories of your Angell-merit,
Which shine the more, in that you make them lesse?
Now could I wish, I had a plenteous braine▪
That thence (as from Inuentions clearest floud)
Those formes might flow, composd in a rich vaine:
That crowne your noblesse, and enrich your bloud.
Thē would my zeale breake forth like mornings fier
That now lyes spent in sparkes of my defier.
