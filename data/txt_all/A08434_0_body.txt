I Haue presumed (Right honou∣rable) vpon these three reasons to present this vnworthy pam∣phlet vnto your honors courte∣ous view, and fauourable pro∣tection. The first is from your own noble wor∣thinesse, for that you are, and are so thought, the onely Hector of Albion: and therfore most worthy to protect Hector. The second, for that it was the wil and desire of the Ghost, of the woful Ghost of Ilion: that in hir teares you might behold the sorrows of your owne coun∣trey whensoeuer iniurious fates shoulde cause you miscarrie. The third and last is (my good Lord) mine owne priuate affection, wherein I haue long honoured you, and hauing no place to make it knowne, haue long desired to finde some opportunitie to shew the same. I hope

your Lordship will pardon me, for that affecti∣on is a most veniall offence. And if heerein I doe not honour your Lordship so much as you are worthy, and I earnestlie wish, yet please it you to fauour and pardon this first, and as time and yeares shall enable me with a more experi∣enced iudgement and knowledge, I will studie and endeuour that, which shal be more worthy your honours fauourable protection. Please it you accept, and I am graced, and my labour richly rewarded. I cease to trouble your Lord¦ship further at this time, I vow my selfe to your Lordships seruice, and so most humbly take my leaue.
