MOst honoured Prince; let it be no wonder vnto your Grace, why I doe implore your Ioynt Patronage with your Prince, of these my La∣bours,
sith you are his Ionathan, and haue beene a companion and faithfull friend vnto him in all his Trauells; manifesting your selfe to bee as faithfull to that Sonne, as you were fauoured of the Father. As therefore you were his Associate in his Peregrination, so ioyne with him in the Patronizing of this worke: Moreo∣uer, as you were a chiefe instrument of hindring the mariage with Spaine, and furthering this with France, by which meanes, you brought happinesse vnto this Iland, for the which, it yeeldeth vnto your Grace; so also you are men∣tioned in this worke, and a ioynt Subiect of it; vouchsafe therefore to be a ioynt Patron of it.
A fourth Motiue which encourageth me in this request, is, that as you are the chiefe Fauourite of our King on earth, and of God the King of Kings, so you are aprincipall fa∣uourer of all good and worthy proceedings, by which your name is embalmed with fame, and your memory will bee immortall. Not doubting therefore but you will grace this worke with milde acceptance, though not for the manner of writing, yet the matter written of in it, I cease to trouble you, but alwaies rest an humble suiter to your grace for accep∣tance,
and to God, for the continuance of your happinesse in the present, and your increase of it in the future, that you may bee blessed inter∣nally, externally, and eternally, and that the highest would multiplie all temporall and spi∣rituall graces vpon your Grace.
