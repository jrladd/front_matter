Honoured Sir,
THe learned Stoick wisely perpending the right way of receiving Good-turns, with the just reddition and return of them in sutable Gratitude, re∣sembles it to a Game at Tennys; where, though it be a considerable part of the Play to receive the Ball with agility and skill, nevertheless (saith Seneca) N dicitur bonus lusor,De be∣nefic. l. 2. Ep. 32. nisi qui apte & expedite pilam remiserit quam exceperat; None deserves the commendation
of a good Gamester, unless he send it back again with equal vigour and dexterity. Whereupon out of an unfeigned sensibleness of your re∣spective kindness, and ever obliging courtesies, I began to consider, how I might serram reciprocare, and give some reciprocal testimony of those manifold respects I ow you; the which in my weak judgment I con∣ceived I could not more seasonably perform, than in a Subject or Ar∣gument of Gratitude, to which I have at present taken the boldness to give my self the Honour to prefix your Name; which if you design favourably to accept, I have all I aimed at, and shall ever acknow∣ledg my self
