BEeing at stryse with my selfe, (Right honorable) whether I might presume to exhibite the dedication of this my vnpolished labour vn∣to your good Lordship or not, I was as oft abashed as I vewed the homelinesse of my style, and eftsons vtterly discomfited. But contrary wise, while I considered with my selfe (as it were waying in the other Balaunce) your noble nature in accepting the good will of the geeuer aboue the valure of the gift, I am againe recomforted, And in the ende of this conflict, the noble curtesie of your ho∣nour wonne in mee the victorie: whereupon I was not onely en∣boldened my self, humbly to desyre your L. Patronage, but also (as muche as in mee laye) encouraged my Aucthour, master Edmunde Harman, to offer vnto you the grosse fruites of this our labours. The matter meriteth the Pen of the best writer, although it hath nowe happened to the handes of an vneloquent Compyler. But if it may please your honour to accept the pro∣tection hereof, I doubt not but bothe the matter, and the wor∣thinesse of the Patrone, will stirre vp some of exquisite skill to furnishe my defect by the renuyng of this my begonne attempt. VVhich I confesse to be by mee taken in hande, more willingly

then wittilye, respecting more the truthe of the woorkes then the eloquence of wordes. Thus ceasing to trouble your good Lordship any longer at this present with my rough and ragged style, In moste humble wise I submit my selfe and this my sclender trauaile, vnto your honour, praying allmightie God to preserue and prosper you in all your noble affaires to the great comfort of this Realme.
