RIght Honourable Patron, to your state
In duty I these Triumphs dedicate,
Wherein your Worthy Brother-hood Approves
Greatnesse and goodnes of their minds, and loves,
Their true affections and their liberall charge,

They have most bountifull exprest at large,
And London in these Triumphs is renownd
Above all cities in the worlds wide Round:
For no Kings Deputy, or Magistrate
Is with such pompous state inaugurate,
As Londons Mayor is, which most plainly showes
The Kings illustrious greatnesse whence it flowes;
To whom then should my dedication run,
But unto you, for whom these things were done?
Your power is Londons watch-towre to espie,
Dangers far off, and perills that are nigh:
Your foresight must see much, and it is plaine,
Millions of eyes will looke on you againe,
For envy and detraction pries and stares
T'assault true honour, and t'intrap in snares
All that is good, for it is manifest,
That envie alwaies feeds upon the best.
This citie (the Kings Chamber) must be kept
Cleane for his use, from foule pollution swept,
And sure, that power that hath you thus advanc'd,
To be thus honour'd, lov'd and countenanc'd,
Will ever be your portion, and content,
And governe you in this your government.
That you (at helme) a steddy course may steare

Twixt Justice, and blest Mercy, many a yeare
Especially in this your greatest state,
Let Hospitality still keepe your Gate;
And Liberality, with welcome stand,
To greet men with a free and open hand,
Then Muses, Graces, Arts, the praise shall sing
Of you (my Lord) Lieutenant to my King.
