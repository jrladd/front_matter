MY LORD:
LOW shrubs are sheltered by lofty Cedars; I hope the same from your Honour.

The Subject which I pre∣sent is warlike, though my Profession be peaceable: 'tis compendious, and not traced by many, scarce by any before: I have made the discovery; and referre the whole, being discove∣red, to your Honors judg∣ment. 'Tis not the meere fancy of a Schollers braine, but many yeares Experi∣ence abroad in forraigne Leaguers, with great dan∣ger, which produc't it.
Accept it (Great Lord) though presented at no

lesse a distance than the foote is from the Head: and when your weighty Military Ingagements will afford your Honour some small recesse, vouchsafe it a perusall.
I have been so bold to present my selfe, and this small Tract of warre unto your Honours protection, in regard your Honours Regiment ranne the same hazards of warre in Germa∣ny with three more of our English Nation, under the Command of our General

the Lord Morgan; where∣in I was imbarqued, and with whom I suffered re∣solutely and willingly the utmost of dangers that a professed Enemy with all his power & policy could proportion for our troops. Secondly, I know your Honours ability to deter∣mine of a Subject of this Nature, and to protect both the Parent and the Childe from publicke In∣jury.
That the Great God of Hosts may safeguard your

Honour, and that your go∣ings Out, and commings In, may be for ever prosperous and successefull, prayes the meanest of
