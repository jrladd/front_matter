My LORD,
YOU are so many wayes
Entitled to the Patro∣nage
of the ensuing Ad∣vices,
as I do not know how I

could be just in omitting this oc∣sion
of a publick acknowledg∣ent
of it. For whether the
Subject be considered, as relating
either to Conscience or Learning,
you have a right of judging all
concernments of either kind:
the former as Metropolitane, and
consequently as the supreme Guide
of Conscience under God in the
Church of Ireland; the later as
Vice-Chancellor of our Vniversi∣ty,
in which regard you are most
justly interessed in the fruits and
seeds of your own cultivation:
or the persons concerned, they are
all of them such as depend on
your direction, and therefore the
rules for whose behaviour ought

most properly to be communica∣ted
to them by your recommen∣dation:
or my self, as you have
upon all occasions given eviden∣ces
of your favour to me, so
more signally in this affair, by first
advising this publication, and af∣ter
honouring it with your own
License and approbation. How∣ever
presumptuous the attempt
might seem, in other regards, yet
to a Judge so candid and favoura∣ble,
as I have alwayes found your
Grace to be, the innocence and
sincerity of my design for resto∣ring
Christianity to her primitive
splendor, may suffice to excuse,
if not expiate, appendent impru∣dences.
For your Grace alrea∣dy

understands too well to be in∣formed
by me, how vain it is to
attempt a Reformation of the
Laity whilest the Clergie is not
held in that Reputation by them
which might provoke them to an
imitation of their example; and
how little hopes there are of re∣triving
that Reputation without
a Reformation of their lives and
a restitution of their discipline,
which would prove the most ex∣pedient
means to let such persons
who either cannot, or will not,
distinguish betwixt the Sacred∣ness
of their Office and their per∣sonal
demerits, understand the un∣expressible
usefulness of their
Calling being piously and con∣scientiously

discharged in order
to the most momentous and most
noble ends of mankind. And
that a preconsideration must needs
prove more successful in promo∣ting
this industry in practice,
which would, by way of obvi∣ous
consequence, restore their
honour, than any postnate advi∣ces
as being likely to prevent the
engagement or admission of such
persons who would not after∣wards
be capable of such impres∣sions;
and that it is more secure
for the persons concerned to let
them understand the personal and
habitual qualifications necessary
for rendring their duty perfor∣mable
by them than afterwards

to admonish them concerning
particulars, when it is too late to
retire, how unsuitable soever the
practice prove to their personal
qualifications, will not, I think, be
doubted by any intelligent consi∣derative
person. This is my
design in the former of the sub∣sequent
Letters, the usefulness
and convenience whereof is fur∣ther
cleared in the Letter it self,
and has not, that I know of,
been attempted by any other.
If it had, I should very willing∣ly
have spared my own pains.
My manner of performance al∣so
has been at once to shew the
Adces rational and to have
been designed by our Church, that

so it might be fitted for all sorts
of concerned Readers, both
such as are able to judge it them∣selves,
and such as are not. I
have therefore ordered the whole
in such a series of discourse as
that the sequel must needs be ad∣mitted
by him who has granted
the principles lay'd down at the
beginning; and the first principle
is that which the Church her self
first enquires into, even a Provi∣dential
Call from God, or a motion
of the Spirit, as far as that may
be credited without danger of
Enthusiasme; and accordingly
the inferences have generally been
examplified in such instances as
have been approved by our

Church since her reformation, that
so I might, as well as I was able,
prevent objections against my
design from the inconsiderableness
of my person, an artifice too usual∣ly,
as it is weakly and unreaso∣nably,
made use of for the de∣feating
the most commendable
projects. The objection in it
self is in truth so very little mo∣mentous
as that I should not
think it worthy to be taken no∣tice
of, if I were not more soli∣citous
for my cause than my per∣son.
But seeing it is so obvious
in the way of persons that may
be concerned to cross my design,
and withall so taking with the
vulgar, I doubt it will concern

me even in prudence to crave
your Graces patience for a brief
Apology. Omitting therefore my
own justification, which I confess
a task too great for my weak a∣bilities
(though if I did under∣take
it on a publick account, I
might for an excuse of such im∣modesty,
urge the example of
the great Apostle, who, out of
tenderness for his cause, was (as
himself confesses) necessitated to
such a folly) yet I conceive it un∣denyable
that the merit of the
cause is abundantly sufficient to
compensate the demerit of my
person, and for my part, so that
the cause may not be prejudiced,
I shall very heartily submit the

choice of Instruments to the plea∣sure
of God himself. Besides
further that it is extreamly un∣reasonable
to urge personal deme∣rits
against a cause. Indeed if
the cause had been recommended
on personal regards, the disparage∣ment
of the person might have
invalidated such a recommendati∣on.
But considering that no∣thing
here is pretended, but the
solidity of the reasons submitted to
an impartial examination; none
can say that they are the weaker
for being propounded by an un∣worthy
person. Neither indeed
is the supposal true, that even in
point of Authority any thing here
is recommended onely by my pri∣vate

person; for having shewn it
in every particular approved and
designed by the Church, it must
needs be supported by her Au∣thority,
which may well be pre∣sumed
sufficient for the design in∣tended,
the general reformation of
her Clergie. But I must thank∣fully
acknowledge that your
Grace has in a great measure
freed me from these personal odi∣um's
by undertaking the Patro∣nage
of these otherwise despisable
attempts. For none can now
pretend themselves unconcerned
in the Advice of a Laick or a
private person when the supreme
Metropolitane has not onely
thought it convenient, but recom∣mended

it. This is the reason
that necessitated me to take San∣ctuary
in your Graces Patronage,
wherein I dare more confidently
promise my self a kind reception
because you have encouraged it.
Yet am I not herewith satisfied;
but as necessitous persons are usu∣ally
emboldened to new requests
by past concessions; so, in order to
the desired success of these Pa∣pers,
I further beg a favour, grea∣ter
and more efficacious than the
greatest munificence of the most
potent Temporal Princes, though
less impoverishing, and that is
your Fatherly blessing and Pray∣ers
for these and the other Studies
and endeavours of
