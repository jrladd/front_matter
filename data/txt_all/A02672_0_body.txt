THere are novv three yeeres passed since at the request of some I communicated this sermon of mine in vvriting to those vvhich not long after obtained for it allovvance to go abroad in print, and novv at the last, it having receiued the fruite of that allovvance, I offer it vn∣to as many of you as desire to profite by the remembrance of that vvhich yee once heard before. Vse it (I beseech you) to that end for vvhich I first spake it and novv offer it vnto you, that is, to your further building vp in the feare of our God, and honour of our Soueraigne. If you remem∣ber
any more than is here set dovvne, vse that also to the same end; and laying a part all vanities of the vvorld, set your minds on those things vvhich may profite in the day of the visitation of all flesh. The grace of our God be vvith you.
From my chamber at North Mimmes, this 16, of October, 1590.
