REVEREND SIR,
WHEREAS o∣ther Dedicati∣ons are grounded merely up∣on Respect and Honour, or upon the prospect of some Advantage to the Book,
or Author; this is more im∣mediately an Effect of Ju∣stice: since it is by Your Encouragement that this Translation appears in Pub∣lick, You having been pleas∣ed to peruse and approve it. Yet this, SIR, is not all I have to alledge for this De∣dication: For whether I consider You as a Zealous Defender of our Christian Religion against Atheism; or of our Reformed Religi∣on against the Romish Su∣perstion, which is the old Paganism reviv'd and var∣nish'd
over; I cannot make a fitter Choice of a Patron, either for MINƲCIƲS FELIX, or myself, who am,
REVEREND SIR,

London, July 10. 1682.
