SInce we are satisfied of your Friendly readiness to Publish our Favours, even before you have receiv'd 'em, we thought our selves oblig'd
 by so much good nature, to give you once a just occasion for't, and present you with our Letters. Some fill their De∣dications with nothing but Apologys for their making 'em: Some cunningly place the name at the bottom of the Picture, to try if our Wit could guess at what they meant by the Dau∣bing above: Others, as 'twere on design, write you asleep in the beginning, to convince you they're in Love, as they tell you, at the latter end: while this Geographically Witty ever treats you with a Fool of such or such a Climate, and Tra∣vels
 for business to Japan, or Arragon, when God knows, and you may convince him, we have as much, as he can turn his hand to, at Home: Nay, some, tho' they were Ad∣dressing to you, would have the impertinence to bring in Latin and Greek. Thus all, like true Lovers, talk least of the thing they come about: but we, skill'd in Men, are too sensible how pleasing 'tis to know we are admir'd, to entertain you with any thing but your selves; and shall clear our selves from the Sus∣picion of Flattery in such
 Cases, when you know our Complement to you is an ac∣count of a Quarrel that lately happen'd among us about you; and sure you can't believe we flatter, when it comes to that: To make short, meeting the other Day at— after the usual Entertainment of Modes and Dressing, we na∣turally fell into Discourse of you; when each singled out her Man, and strove to set him uppermost; one was prais'd for his way of Dress, another for the throw of his Periwig, this for a pretty Face, and and that for the Airy ma∣nagement
 of an ugly one: the Dispute was hotly maintain'd a great while, but finding no end could be made in this, because there was thought to be no Standard for Beauty; we unanimonsly resolv'd to de∣termine the business by their Writing: Much was said on all hands, and many shrewd Criticisms made: This Man's Verses were arraign'd for Non∣sence; and that many Plays for having in 'em more Bawdy than Wit.

Another's Songs were con∣demn'd for having nothing in 'em; but because 'twas uni∣versal with such Writers, the Remark was not taken notice of; She that accus'd 'em growing angry that She could not come in for her Share of abusing, fell foul on the Author's Person, and said that he mov'd by the same Rules that he Writ, that every thing was so stiff about him, that nothing was out of Form, and that there was no∣thing but Form, that he minc'd all his Words, to make 'em come fine from him:
 and to make us the better understand her the other day, said She, when a common Man would have said, 'Twas a rude thing, turning to me, his Face and Body in one Motion, Madam, said he, I protest 'twas most dis∣ingagingly done: Was there ever such an Ape? Nay, tho' he be the most ugly of them all, yet in his Songs is ever dying for Love. The Pa∣tient, She that admir'd him, cou'd hold no longer, but ad∣vanc'd to revenge the abuse of his Person and Parts on her Head-dress; the rest of
 us thought our Cause as wor∣thy Defending, and each drew out against her, that had a∣bus'd it, when C—coming in, put a stop to the War.
