THese ensuing Sheets are chiefly the Relation of the wonderful passages of the 14 last Years. Then the 2 last of which there are few that deserve to be more Celebrated in Historie, next to those that were so renowned for the Active part of the KINGS Restoration: though it may be questioned to which Historie will give the precedence: whe∣ther to those of His Restoration, or those of His preservation. In reference to which, several of the occurrences have almost equall'd Miracles, and therefore merit to

be recorded, and to be read with con∣sideration, as the evincing Proofs of an over-ruling Providence.
The Relation begins at the great Con∣flagration of the CITY, as being the first remarkable Effect of the Treason then hatching. For to repeat the stories of Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles the first; would have bin only to have tir'd the Reader, with what is already sufficiently made known, both in English and Latin, to all the Prote∣stants in the World; and only serves to swell a Volume to the unprofitable and needless expence of the Buyer. If any thing has bin left out, it has bin for fear of invading the properties of other Men, whose Narratives though at that time seasonable, yet can never hope to be in∣serted in a story, where their Epitomes

are only necessary. Omissions may be, but tis thought, by those that have viewed these sheets, there are very few or none of Moment. Whatever they be, the Reader, tis hop'd, will pardon them, considering the multiplicitie of affairs, and the present juncture of time.
