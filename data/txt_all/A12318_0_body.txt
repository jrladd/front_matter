Noble SIR,
YOur most Generous and He∣roicall disposition, seene and manifested in love, and profes∣sed affection to both Art and Armes, or whatsoever best things Learning and all laudable Inventions, the daughters of Minerva and the Muses, in whom you may justly claime no small interest; makes me both offer this, and assured of your honourable and kindest acceptation (as in things of inferiour nature hath been dgned) more especially of these divine Sonnets, howso∣ever the manner, not so worthily agreeing with the majesty of the matter, yet not meanly

dignified by the divinenesse and excellency of the subiect: A Lyrique in his own ancient & native language, wherein I could also present him thus modernly dimensioned to our times, & therein the most worthy the best favour & regard. So offering it (such as it is) to your Patronage, having testimony sufficient of your courteous respect to any, even the meanest of my Poeticall essayes & endeavours in this kind, till fit apportunity be offered by the dedications of some graver treatise, (though better can∣not be than this) to remember your honoura∣ble Name: I rest in all humility devoted
