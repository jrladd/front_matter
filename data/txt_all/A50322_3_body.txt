THey that desire to ingratiate themselves with a Prince, commonly use to offer them∣selves to his view, with things of that nature as such persons take most plea∣sure and delight in: where∣upon we see they are many times presented with Horses and Armes, cloth of gold, pretious stones, and such like orna∣ments, worthy of their greatness. Having then a mind to offer up my self to your Magnificence, with some testimony of my service to you, I found nothing in my whole inventory, that I think bet∣ter of, or more esteeme, than the knowlege of great mens actions, which I have learned by a long experience of modern affairs, and a conti∣nual reading of those of the ancients. Which, now that I have with great diligence long workt it out, and throughly sifted, I commend to your Magnificence. And however I may well think this work unworthy of your view; yet such is your humanity, that I doubt not but it shall find acceptance, considering, that for my part I am not able to tender a greater gift, than to present

you with the means, whereby in a very short time you may be able to understand all that, which I, in the space of many years, and with many suffe∣rances and dangers, have made proof and gaind the knowledge of. And this work I have not set forth either with elegancy of discourse or stile, nor with any other ornament whereby to captivate the reader, as others use, because I would not have it gain its esteem from elsewhere than from the truth of the matter, and the gravity of the subject. Nor can this be thought presumption, if a man of humble and low condition venture to dilate and discourse upon the governments of Princes; for even as they that with their pensils designe out countreys, get themselves into the plains below to consider the nature of the moun∣tains, and other high places above; and again to consider the plains below, they get up to the tops of the mountains; in like manner to under∣stand the nature of the people, it is fit to be a Prince; and to know well the dispositions of Princes, sutes best with the understanding of a subject. Your Magnificence then may be pleased, to receive this small present, with the same mind that I send it; which if you shall throughly per∣use and consider, you shall perceive therein that I exceedingly wish, that you may attain to that greatness, which your own fortune, and your excellent endowments promise you: and if your Magnificence from the very point of your High∣ness shall sometime cast your eyes upon these inferi∣or places, you shall see how undeservedly I un∣dergoe an extream and continual despight of Fortune.
