To your deere Elders; and besides the Due
Which to your Selfe might iustly thence accrw;

The rather, sith we first receiu'd from you,
The speedy Notice (no lesse quick than true)
HENRY'S Death, through Hells dis-chained Rage.

In suddaine Clowd of his owne Royall Bloud.

O! Iust Revenge, roote out th' Ignatian Pack,
The Moules that moou'd in Faux and Rauaillac.
