Right VVorshipfull,
IT befell this Sermon in its deliuery, what some pregnant animals doth sometime in theirs Times orifice was so strait, affaires of publique Iudicature, like impatient Midwiues, so violent to haue all soone out, that limbs not a few were left behind. This after birth (extorted by friends importunity) hath brought out all, and presents you the whole Foetus with its intended inte∣grals, though weake I confesse, and very feeble. My humblest intreaty now is but the hire of a roome or two vnder the roofe of your Affections

for shelter a little, or if I may presume it) edu∣cation. Perhaps (so the Lord giue life and pow∣er to it) it may become, if no instrument of much good abroad, yet (like King Philips Seruitour with his dead-mans skull) as a domestique Mo∣nitor to serue in daily to your thoughts some  or timely watchword for preparation a∣gainst the great Iudge his comming. Wee are all too apt by Satans guiles, the deceits of sinne, and bewitching cares and profits of this life, as by some Mercuries pipe, Argos-like to bee sung asleepe, and so like foolish Virgins out-sleeping seasons of getting oyle in our lamps, to bee cast behinde hand: How seasonable then some thorn at securities breast to keep it waking, that when the Iudge appeares, our lamps bee trimm'd, our loynes girt vp, our lights burning. Worthy Sir, if this Infant-attempt may proue auayl-some to such an end, either on your owne or any others soule, take it, tis yours, vse it. Here will bee e∣nough for me. My Master shall haue glory, you boldnesse in the day of the Lord Iesus.
 Columpton April 30. 1632.
