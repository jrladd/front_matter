RIGHT HONOVRABLE:
SVch as my poore selfe, that am
only a looker on of your vertues,
as a Passenger in a streete behol∣ding
the Frontispice of some de∣licate
Edifice, but debarred the
entrance and search into the in∣ward
roomes, must be contented,
or if you please indebted to the
opinion and report of others; which I haue found so
ample and enlarged concerning your great Honour,
and greater worthinesse, that I will forbeare any further
insinuation, least I step into a kind of flattery, a vice in∣cident
to most men, refused of none, yet in all fortunes
to be disclaimed of a Gentleman: only I must adde
this, that I am proud of mine owne assurance, that you
are borne to adorne our Country, and illustrate our
Court, wherein your industrie, loyaltie, and immacu∣late
truth shall make your vertues compleat and tri∣umphant.
Therefore great Lord haue I chosen out this

History, meerely for the strangenesse, and charactred
you the Patron of my endeauours for the obseruations,
that the remarkeable passages heerein proposed, of
which euen Scotland had a part, may serue for all per∣sons
in such dignity and eminent places, both for pre∣cept,
and caution.
For Precept, to florish in their owne honours, and
moue in their owne orbes, sticking close to the glory
of their Countrie, and clinging to the sides of Maiesty,
that the King may aske, what shall be done to the man,
whom he would honour, and the Common-wealth fol∣low
them with Panegyricall applauses, who preserue
her peace from the rauishing, and deforming of stran∣gers,
be the hopes to the contrary neuer so probable,
or inductiue.
For Caution, not once to put any confidence in de∣ceiuers,
nor belieue the Diuell himselfe, though he pro∣mise
to giue the Kingdomes of the World, which are
none of his: yet, I confesse him Prince of the same,
that is, of the abuses and impieties therein both raging,
and raigning: and the rather, because the end hath euer
beene perdition of body, soule, honour, estates and
posteritie: nor can the pleading of simplicitie in the se∣duction,
or ignorance in the credulity serue the turne:
For though Princes may times haue beene drawne to
pardon the offences of Subiects, and refractary delin∣quents,
wallowing or rather sunk ouer head & eares in
the mierie bogs of such conuulsions: yet are they not
alwaies to be presumed vpon, nor will the Common-wealth
endure the indignitie, or giue way to any person
whatsoeuer in vilipending the gouernment.
I humbly therefore request your Honour to reade

ouer this true and strange Story, and take in worth my
good meaning, which presenteth the same vnto you
I protest without any other motiue, then to see you flo∣rish,
as a supportation of our Common-wealth, and iewel
of our kingdome. As for the faults and my presump∣tion,
I expect, that that vertue and goodnesse, which
must make you famous in this world, and happy in the
world to come, will extend but her owne properties to
my pardon and admission, knowing that if I haue done
ill; wisdome is not bought in the market, and yet God
bids vs come without money; if well, it is in your ho∣nourable
fauour, and noble acceptation.
