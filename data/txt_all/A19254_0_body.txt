'TIs not so great a worke to purchase love,
As to retaine it, never to remove.
Thy Art herein hath made thee excellent,
A grace unto thy Place, a President!
Never therein had any such applaud,
Of such perinnity, Angelick land!
None of the Proto-stewards like to thee,
So changelesse, constant, so perpetuall free.
Then blame them not to praise and love thee too,
Their Tribute is no more than what is due:
Nor mine no lesse than theirs; So I present
Faiths Triumph to thy hand, to give content:
With all, To such a good Germanicus,
I wish long life; Thy old men Clerke it thus.
Amen.
