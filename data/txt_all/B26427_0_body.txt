MADAM,
I Have presumed to offer Your Ladyship this litle Work, such as it is, a small fruit of my Stu∣dy; which as it concerns all Bearing Women (for convenien∣cy of the Matter treated therein, their Welfare to wit, and Safety in that Condition: A more commodious Birth also, and safer propagation of the Fruit of their Womb) so chiefly the more Noble and Honourable, as be∣ing more Excellent, more Tender and Delicate, and readily more opprest with the Symptoms: To be the Mothers be∣side
 of Hero's, or a more worthy and illustrious Off-spring, the Quin∣tessence of Mankind, these visible gods, which must propogate and support the Splendor and Dignities of the World.
It is most fit then, decent and necessar, that such understand the state of Preg∣nancy and its Accidents: Of Bearing also and Child bed, to Govern and Pre∣serve, or Relieve themselves, through the manifold Calamities and Perils thereof. To Order likewise, Nourish and Preserve, or yet Cure and Releive their Noble and Delicate Infants, in the manifold Maladies attends that Age, from the very first entry of Life, whereby it oftimes languishes and is ruined; that Health may be got fixed in∣to their tender Bodies, which else re∣mains unserviceable: And hence also their Minds degenerous.
Suffer me therefore, most Noble Lady, with that Humility and Submis∣sion as is meet, to depositate the same at Your Feet, as a small Token of my Af∣festion,
 Respect and Observance, and of a Mind perpetually confecrated to Your Service; which if I shall understand not to be inacceptible (and of Old, nei∣ther hithertil, are Paper Presents un∣usual, nor yet despised) and that You vouchsafe me good Will and Favour, I have wherein to be glad as no small Re∣ward of my Labour. Nor would I but chuse Your Illustrious Name, being ver∣tuous Consort to the Noble Marques of Douglas, whose most obsequious Vassal and Client I am, as for other Causes, so by vertue of my Native Soyl: To build that Noble House also. A Lady beside of Noble generous Birth and Education: Of all exquisit Vertues: An absolut Pat∣tern of true Piety & Prudence: Of grea∣test Elegancy, adorning and sincerity of Life, of upright, chast, entire Behaviour and unstained Fame: And tho High, yet admirably Affable, Modest and Cour∣teous. But I will not offend Your Ears with a heap of Elogies, however most true▪ Only let me hope Your candid and
 favourable Acceptance of this Dedica∣tion, as it proceeds from me with Affe∣ction and Observance: Your Pardon also, if I be thought Impudent and Rash, for so mean and small a Gift, and I be∣ing hitherto unknown to Your Ladiship. Yet however I must not cease wishing to Your Ladiship all Welfare and Hap∣piness (with Your Noble Lord and Earl of Angus) the Blessing of a happy Off∣spring: And such an Increase to the Po∣sterity of Douglasses (a Race so Ancient and Renouned) as fabulous Antiquity attributes to the Golden Tree, that one Twig being pluckt off from that Noble House, another Golden Branch may never be wanting, which may still flou∣rish with the same Mettal. From him who craves nothing save to be,
MADAM,
