My Lord,
THe two preceding De∣dications being the one to a King, the other to a Prince, I hope this Third (consisting all of new Mat∣ter) will be the more excusable that I make to your Lpp; who, if ther were a generall Muster of Man∣kind, and due regard had to Gallan∣try and worth, would appear like a King among Princes, and a Prince

among Peers. I humbly pray, that for want of a better thing to comply with the Season, this may pass for a New-years gift, which I wish may carry with it as many good Omens, as it doth Orizons, that a thousand benedictions may fall upon you, and your Noble Family this New yeer, and all the yeers of your life, which I pray may be ma∣ny, many, many, because I have long since resolv'd to live and die,
My Lord, 
Calendis Ian. 1650.
