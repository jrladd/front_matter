Right Worshipful,
SInce it was by the Influence and Power you have over me (for my own Inclination would have led me to neither) that I lately Preached, and now Publish this ensuing Dis∣course, I cannot but call it in some measure yours (pardon my boldness herein) and prefix your Name to give it shelter and protection. I know too well that Censure abounds in this

licentious Age, and what less can I expect than the overflowings thereof from restless men, whose spirits being always in a tumult, do boldly re∣flect even upon that Authority it self, whose Rights I assert and vindicate: But I hope Sir, when Reason and Truth cannot allay this intemperate heat, (a heat which more becomes the Alcoran than the Gospel,) that your Name alone may be able in some measure to do it.
I shall forbear, Sir, all endeavours to blazon your Worth, since your own Learned Writings have done it already for me, they speaking much more to your advantage, than any thing that can be said by him, who is,
Honoured Sir,  Stanton-Quintin
Sept. 24.
