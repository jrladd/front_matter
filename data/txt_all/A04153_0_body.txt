Right Honourable:
YOur fauourable acceptance of my poore endeauours, in an Office of the like nature, hath animated mee againe to put Pen to paper, with a purpose to lenifie that bitter pill of Passion (which naturall affection hath once more caused you to swallow) with the sweet iulip of Consolation. And for as much as Phisitians cannot well apply their Cor∣dialls
to the sicke, till they know the syntomes of the disease; I haue (in a feeling sympathie of your griefe) aymed at your Complaints, and haue written them according to my conceipt, not doubting, but (if I had beene Secretarie to you afflicted thoughts) I should haue made them appeare more like themselues.
Next (as method in that case required) I haue set downe such meditations of Comfort, as I thought best suting to your visitation▪ Beseech∣ing you to vouchsafe them as gracious a cen∣sure, as an humble and deuoted heart may be thought worthy to be allowed, that rests, and euer will remaine
