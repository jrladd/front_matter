Right worthy Sir,
FIrst love can hardly ever be requited. Your affection to me was the more heavenly, being you loved me be∣fore I knew you, and not only made me your Rector of West Wickam, but prosecuted your act, so far as friends and law could prevaile. But it was either my unwor∣thinesse or unhappinesse, that could not overcome the in∣fluence of a malignant planet, which struck me without giving me any reason why, by which I am disabled to serve you that have deserved so much of me, not only in prefer∣ring me to the utmost of your power, but also accepting (at my request) my son to be your Minister, who (I do hope) will prove faithfull in his Stewardship, and thank∣full to all his wel-wishers, especially to so Noble a Patron as your selfe; to whom I shall ever rest,
