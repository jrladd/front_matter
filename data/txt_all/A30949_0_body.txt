SIR,
THat you have in your Family Three Knights of the Garter, is a great honour; but 'tis a great∣er honour, that there be in your Family many more, excelling in Cour∣tesie,
 and Valour, and Loyalty, and Prudence, and in that which is the Head of Wisdome, the Fear God. Where the fear of God is, there also dwel's a Reverence to the Mini∣sters of God, the Fathers and Doctours of the Church: Of which Qua∣lity are most of the Per∣sons remembred in these papers, which I have guild∣ed, as it were, and beau∣tified with your flourish, ing Name. Some Gen∣tlemen are here mixed
 with the Church-men. And I heartily pray, they may be alwaies conjoyned, and lovingly united, for their mutual, both tem∣poral and eternal, happi∣ness. These Memorials are of the Deceased onely. I believe we have their Equals of both sorts now Living. Whom God in mercy hath rescued from the late Calamities, and reserved for Himself and for his Vice-gerent our most Cracious Soveraign, that they might serve
 Him in this blessed Restau∣ration of Church and State. May they happily go on; and You, Right Noble Sir, among the first Ranks, to deserve that Glory, which, if they re∣ceive not at present from an Ingrateful Age, Poste∣rity will surely render to their Memories.
 April 23.
