SIR, the generall voice of your worthines,
and the manie particular fauours which I
haue heard Master Campion (with dutifull
respect often acknowledge himselfe to haue
receiued from you) haue emboldned mee to
present this Booke of Ayres to your fauoura∣ble
iudgement, and gracious protection; es∣pecially
because the first ranke of songs are of
his owne composition, made at his vacant
houres, and priuately emparted to his friends, whereby they grew
both publicke, and (as coine crackt in exchange) corrupted: some
of them both words and notes vnrespectiuely challenged by others.
In regard of which wronges, though his selfe neglects these light
fruits as superfluous blossomes of his deeper Studies, yet hath it plea∣sed
him vpon my entreaty, to grant me the impression of part of
them, to which I haue added an equall number of mine owne. And
this two-faced Janus thus in one bodie vnited, I humbly entreate
you to entertaine and defend, chiefely in respect of the affection
which I suppose you beare him, who I am assured doth aboue all o∣thers
loue and honour you. And for my part, I shall thinke my selfe
happie if in anie seruice I may deserue this fauour.
