My Lord,
THis discourse I penned in the year 1642. under the borrowed name of Irenaeus Philalethes. Since when, some written copies of it have privately passed thorow many hands, not with∣out approbation from some, both loyal Subjects of the Crown, and o∣bedient sons of the Church of En∣gland:

unto whom, for their emi∣nent worth, I have great reason to to bear much respect. That now, being altogether a stranger, I take upon me the boldness, in mine own name, and publickly, to present it with my humble service to your Lordship, is because I am confident∣ly perswaded, that you are a very zealous, & will be a constant Asser∣tour of that religious Loyalty, which is pleaded for in this discourse Con∣cerning which, although I must con∣fess, that there is no such appearance of learning, art or wit in it, as may be sufficient to render it considerable unto curious heads, yet I hope there is some such evidence of truth and sincerity, with peaceable humility & moderation, as may serve to shew it not unfit for entertainment amongst

honest hearts. Howsoever I am preswaded, that there is nothing in it, which will be offensive unto any, except they be such, as think themselves wiser then the holy Scriptures can make them, or pur∣pose to promote their own particu∣lar and private ends, although it be to the general and publick prejudice of Christianity: Whom I never did either desire to please by complying with them, or fear to offend by dis∣senting from them: but in all the long time of my almost perpetual suf∣ferings, in one kind or other, have still lived in a confident and pati∣ent expectation of that, which now with joy and gladness I behold, the happy Resurrection in our land of Christian Orthodox Principality and Prelacy, or Monarchy and Hie∣rarchy

in abstracto: which I have ever esteemed to be the most lively representations of the two witnesses, Rev. 11. and most exactly compara∣ble unto them, if not rather purposely intended by them (as I have intima∣ted in the 25. Section of the right Rebel) and that all their adherents were in a far more comfortable con∣dition, when most abased in their own wants, then any of their ene∣mies could be, when they most a∣bounded with the spoils of other men. Blessed be the God of peace, that of his abundant mercy hath once again spoken peace unto his peo∣ple, and restored comfort unto them and their mourners: He of his in∣finite goodness give them grace, not as pretended onely, but as real Sains indeed, to continue in his

goodness, and never to turn again unto any of their former follies. That your Lordship may live long on earth to enjoy the comforts, and ta last in heaven receive the reward of all that you have done, and shall do worthily, for the glory of God, and the good of his Church, is, and shall be the prayer of,
