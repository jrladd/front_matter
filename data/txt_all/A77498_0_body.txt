Much affected in the Lord,
NOT having a better Legacy to leave you, I doe here present you with a Cup, your Sa∣viours Cup, which having him∣self
drunk, he hath left it for you to pledge him in. A thing which sooner or later, in some kinde or other, you must all make account to doe, meeting with many Crosses and Con∣flicts here upon Earth, and at length be brought under the power of that last Enemy, Death. Now that you may learn so to drink this Cup as your blessed Pattern did, sub∣mitting to your Heavenly Fa∣ther, in suffering his Will, Pa∣tiently, Obediently, Willingly, is the Design of this Treatise. Wherein you shall meet with many usefull and needfull Di∣rections tending to this end.
These I shall desire you care∣fully to lay up in the Closet of your Souls, that you may have them at hand to make use of, as Providence shall offer occasion. Which that they may be blessed to my selfe and you, and through Grace made effectuall for the purpose to which they are designed, is and shall be the Earnest Prayer of him who is
Yarmouth, Anno 1659. M. 2. D. 23.
