MY LORD,
SInce I must own this Comedy, which I now
humbly Present to Your Lordship, to be very
deficient, I am sure I have done well to make
choice of a Patron so able to protect it, as Your
Lordship is. I am heartily willing to confess my
want of Ability in writing; but am proud of an
opportunity to record the General Approbation the
Town has been pleas'd to afford me; a great share
of which must be attributed to Your Lordship's
Appearance on my behalf.
I have been long desirous of making some evident
Acknowledgments for the Favours I have received
at Your Lordship's hands. And however I have
now fail'd in my Performance, I have done my self
right in publishing my Thanks; Returns which are
most justly due to Your Lordship: To You, my
Lord, whose early Actions I have seen with Admi∣ration;
and whose future Atchievements will, I am
confident, be answerable to the Honours which are

devolv'd to You from a most Noble and Heroick
Ancestor. I shall herein wave any thing that may
have the least resemblance to Flattery in respect to
Your Lordship, or to Ostentation as to my self;
and so far deviate from the common method of Epi∣stles
Dedicatory, that I shall not trouble Your
Lordship with a single Quotation. What Acquain∣tance
I have with Criticisms, I will never shew by
collecting Sentences, nor by reciting the Names of
Authors, lest at the same time I should discover my
want of those most essential parts which I ought to
have retain'd in reading them. If for the future I
shall be able to accomplish what will be any ways
suitable to the Encouragement▪ Your Lordship has
been pleas'd to bestow on me, it will wholly answer
the Intentions, as well as the Ambition, of,
MY LORD,
