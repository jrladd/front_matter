Dear Uncle,
WHen I was upon the Tran∣slation of this Piece, I often entertained you with several Stories of it, and you thought them not unpleasant. You now have them all together; and what must needs add to your satisfaction and diversion, you will find a strange account (according to the Arabians) of a Countrey, which affords matter of Admiration to those who travel thither even in our days. You know how often I have bemoan'd your loss of divers excellent Manuscripts, Prophecies, Poetry, and other Sub∣jects,

relating to our own Countrey; for certainly nothing so pleasant as to survey the Genius and Humours of our earliest Predecessors. But since it is vain to call Time to an account for all the excellent things it hath devoured, and to fasten on its Envy what is justly attributed to Humane Negligence, give me leave to re∣commend this Prodigious Treatise (which hath had the Fortune to escape its Teeth) to your perusal; and when I consider, with what com∣placency you quote and reflect on the Actions and Apophthegmes of those who have Inhabited the World many Centuries of years before us, I cannot doubt but you will approve the publick acknowledgment I make, by the present address, of my being,
