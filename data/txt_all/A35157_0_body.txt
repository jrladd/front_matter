IF we look into the World, and but view the Actions of Men, and see what violent Oppression there is of the Poor, and the eager pursuit after Riches; we shall be apt to conclude Men are become lunatick, or infected with the gross Errors of the Sadduces of old: otherways one would think they would never dare to break through the Laws of God and Man at the rate they do; so much the more, consi∣dering the Nation has so lately receiv'd such a signal Deli∣verance, and hath ever since been in imminent Peril: yet these things have made no Impression on the Minds of some Men, but only serv'd to heighten and encrease their Ambi∣tion and Covetousness, which hath been the occasion of many Evils, for which the Land mourns, as will appear by the en∣suing Matter; but it must with all due Acknowledgment be confest, that in Parliament there hath been all imaginable Care taken to prevent Frauds, and the Imbezlement of the Publick Money (but all hath not been sufficient). Yet there hath been one thing wanting, that is, the inspecting into the Actions of the Court, from whence the greatest of our Evils have sprung: Our Fore-fathers ever look'd upon them with a jealous Eye, as being sensible what Temptations they lay under, and what great Opportunities they had of inhing
themselves (especially in the time of War) to the Prejudice of the Nation, and how prone and apt they were to pursue their own Interest, notwithstanding their great Pretensions to Loyalty; and this is certainly a sore and great Evil the Nation now labours under: Therefore vain and fruitless will all Endeavours be, as long as there's so many great and various Corruptions in the Government; and we can expect nothing but Poverty and Misery to attend. There are many Instances both in Holy Writ and History, wherein God hath been pleased to make use of weak and mean Instruments for the bringing his Purposes to pass; and finding a general Si∣lence, the sense of my Duty, and the Apprehension how fatal these things may prove to the Kingdom, is that which hath made me thus presume to address my self to this most August Assembly, from whom alone it is (under God) the Nation can expect Relief. We are happy in a good Prince, who will deny nothing that's fit for good Subjects to ask, and who will be very ready and willing to remove all Grievances, or any thing else that may obstruct the Glory of his Actions, or the happy Settlement of the Kingdom in Peace.
