THE Author having given me leave to choose
a Patron for his Play, I knew not where to
make a better Choice than You, Sir, who
Inherit the Virtues of your Grandfather, the Wor∣thy
Mr. Justice Gregory, as well as his Estate. He,
who so honourably acquitted himself of the great
Trust of Speaker of the House of Commons: He, who
Exerted the Patriot in the worst of Times, and
shew'd himself an Englishman, when 'twas dangerous
to be so; who chose rather to resign his Place on the
Bench, than oblige an Arbitrary Prince, by putting a
forc'd Meaning on the Laws, to serve his Turn, in
destroying the Subject: But his Virtue was reward∣ed,
and this happy Revolution saw him in the Chair,
where he discharged the Duty of a Just Judge, a
Good Christian, and a Charitable Benefactor; in
short, who liv'd belov'd and dy'd lamented by all
Men: I could not, Sir, I am sure, oblige the
Author more, than by putting this his first Endea∣vour
under the Protection of the Heir of this great
Man, who does in nothing degenerate from so Ex∣cellent
an Ancestor; and I, Sir, have no less Satis∣faction,
in making Use of this Opportunity, to
shewhow much I am,
