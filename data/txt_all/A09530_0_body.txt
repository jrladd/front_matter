PEtrarches remedies agaynst both Fortunes in Latine, Right woorshipful, were, as it appea∣reth, dedicated vnto Azo, an honourable Gen∣tleman of Italy. Azo had good cause to enter∣teyne them thankefully, for that being strange∣ly wounded with aduersitie, and cast downe from the dignitie of a Lorde, to the state of a wretched forlorne man, he myght receaue thereby no small comfort in his sorowes. The same woorke now called Physicke agaynst For∣tune in Englishe, and intituled vnto your Woorshypful name, who are no meane personage of this our Realme of Englande, but in this re∣spect farre exceeding the degree of Azo, in that you haue gained surpassing prefermentes at the handes of Fortune, is semblably pre∣sented vnto your fauourable acceptation. Not that it is doubted, the infirmitie of your minde any way to be such, that you stand in neede of these, or the lyke Medicines, to mittigate the sugered Bankettes, or sower sauces of eyther Fortune, that is to say, prosperitie or aduer∣sitie: Although, whoso lyst to examine your right worsbypfull estate, shall well perceyue thereby, that yf your minde coulde be caried away by any of these two affections, the same by lykelyhood should be it which is quite contrarie to that which troubled Azo: since it hath pleased Fortune, or GOD rather, to blesse you with suche valure of Minde, Vertue, Godlynesse, Wysedome, Grauitie, and Learnyng ge∣nerally in all Faculties, Good letters, and Tongues, as fewe or none the lyke farre and wyde to be founde in this our age. Adde herevnto moreouer the commendable cumlinesse of your person, with integri∣tie of health, and good constitution of bodie: And lastly, the accesse of a noble Duchesse to your Wyfe, of an honourable Countesse to your Daughter, of a Lorde apparant to your Sonne and Heyre, besides large
Reuenues and fayre Houses, and which maketh not smally to the ac∣complyshment of worldly felicitie, the fauour of a most vertuous and louing QVEENE, and a most flourishyng Commonwealth to lyue in. These, albeit I confesse they be very great, yet are they not suche, but that your wisedome of it selfe is able to beare them with suffici∣ent moderation, and as in deede they be, so to esteeme of them. But rather in respect of these your rare giftes, and the loue that you beare vnto learnyng, and the fauourers thereof, I haue been induced to exhibite the medicines of Petrarch against Fortune, vnto you, that as many of our Countreimen as shall haue occasion hereafter to reade or vse them, may the more freendly accept them for your Woorshyp∣full name sake. In consyderation whereof, and lykewyse yf it shall please you not discontentedly to accept them at my handes, I shall not onely thynke my trauell well requited, but also in regarde of other benefites receyued, acknowledge my selfe muche bounden vnto you, and to re∣maine your Woorships euermore readie at commaunde∣mente:
