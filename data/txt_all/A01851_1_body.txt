WOrthy Sir; whilst others are ambiti∣ous of an honourable Dedication, I am thankfull for a friendly one, this in the meane time being mine happy advantage over them, that they expect, but I injoy a Patron. And yet I have not such a scarci∣ty of great names, to whom I might pretend with as good a confidence as the greatest part of VVriters, but that some of the higher ranke (to whom for their frequent courtesie I confesse my selfe an unequall debtor) might have expected, others almost challenged my Dedication: to whom I know no other an∣swer of more respect and satisfaction then this,

that I concluded the worke to bee below their notice, how much more their protection; and that I would have others to take notice more of my Friendship, then of my Ambition: But it may bee that some will conceive an Ambiti∣on in this Friendship, when I of such an infancy in study shall boast the favours of so growne a vertue, and intrude upon his fame. If this be an offence, I must professe I glory in it, this accusa∣tion I confesse and am proud of: such is the am∣bition of him that is enamoured on vertue, of the man who would bee indeared to heaven, whose desires would not be so good, were they not so high, and the Angells might have stood, had they never known another Pride. But not to insist on that (which neverthelesse I can never too much insist on, the remembrance of our friendship) to whom could I more fitly dedi∣cate a Poeme, then to him that hath shewed such excellency? or a Divine Poem, then to him that hath shewed such Religion in his compo∣sures? Of this truth Persius is a witnesse, whom you have taught to speake English with such a grace, that wee can understand when wee heare him, and find no one syllable in his Dialect offen∣sive either to the Elegant, or to the Chast Eare. Of this truth Iuvenall may bee a witnesse, whom though wee doe not yet heare in publike bet∣tering

his expressions by your exact rendring him, yet they that have injoy'd the happi∣nesse of your neerer friendship, confidently and upon the hazzard of their understanding affirme, that hee is farre unworthy of such an imprisonment, that hee should bee obscured by that hand which cleared him. But it is Di∣vinity that is the subject of these verses, and it is Divinity which is the exercise, and glory of your studies, which makes you an inhabi∣tant of the Pulpit, nay which makes every place where you will vouchsafe to discourse, to bee a Pulpit, for such is the bounty of your religious conversation, that howsoever the place may bee changed, the Sermon is perpe∣tuall. Sermons that at the same time make us devout and witty, which by first winning the Preacher, have the easier Conquest of the Auditory: who are never with lesse difficul∣ty intreated to their happinesse, then when they see they doe not goe alone. So that now when I consider what I present, and to whom, I beginne to suspect the lightnesse of my worke, and thinke I have some reason to feare the censure of such a Friend, to whom if I shall bee excus'd, I expect some glory from others, not because the Levite, but be∣cause

He was mine, to whom, having thus farre tryed his patience, I have nothing more to adde but this, that I am his,
