IT is the Judgement of most of the ancient Fathers of the Christian Faith, and of the most learned Theologues among the Moderns; that the Au∣thors of the holy Scriptures, when they speak of natu∣ral things, do not design to instruct men in Physical Speculations and the Science of Natural Philosophy; but aim only to excite pious Affections in their breasts, and to induce them to the Worship and Veneration of the true God, whom they celebrated in their Writings: whose Power and Goodness they therefore took all fair Occasions to demonstrate, that they might, from as well the natural as civil Order of things, establish in the Minds of the Readers a right and firm Belief thereof. This then being the only End they proposed to them∣selves, they found themselves obliged so to explicate the visible Works of God and the nature of the things they were to relate, as that they might not, by Novity and Insolency, appear too remote and abhorrent from the

common Sence and pre-conceiv'd Opinions of the Vul∣gar, to whose narrow Capacity and groveling Wit they were always to condescend; yea even to wrest the gene∣ral Causes and Ends of the whole Creation in favour of the Peoples Prejudices, as if all things in the Universe were ordain'd only for the good and benefit of Man∣kind. Nor could it conduce to this their principal pur∣pose, to insist upon second Causes, or defer much to their Efficacy: but rather in all Contingents or Events to recur immediately to God himself, the First Cause, Author and President of Nature; omitting to give any account of that Apparatus and long Series of Causes, which Philosophers use to remark in explica∣ting the Phenomena of Nature, and which Nature her self uses in their production. Whence it is, that these pious Writers compendiously refer all things to the immediate Power of God and to his irresistable Will and Command: leaving men to learn from the Light of Nature or right Reason, (which alone is able to teach it) that the Power of God and the Power of Nature are one and the same, and that all her Laws are his eternal Decrees. For their business was, not to treat of the Principles of Natural Philoso∣phy (as I said before) but to convince the unthinking Multitude that God is the Origine of all things, that universal Nature is obedient to his Will, and that his Providence presides over and governs all things, as

well natural as bumane; which he so disposes and ac∣commodates, as to make them conspire to the good and happiness of those who follow Piety and Vertue, and to the Punishment of the Impious and Vicious: and the Multitude was to be convinced, not by leading their Reason with a long Chain of Premisses and Conclusions Theological; but by surprizing their Imagination, and accommodating Events to their common Opinions, how∣ever unreasonable in themselves.
This well consider'd, as we are not to admire, if we find in the holy Scripture many memorable things related as Miracles, which yet notwith standing proceeded from the fixt and immutable Order of Nature, and necessari∣ly flowed from a Series of Causes ordain'd according to her eternal Laws, that is, from God's Decrees so ought we not rashly to accuse any man of Infidelity, only be∣cause he refuses to believe, that those Miracles were ef∣fected by the immediate Power of God, such as is not only inconsistent with, but point blank repugnant to the fundamental Laws and Constitutions of Nature, which he in his infinite Wisdom hath made, and made so ample and fertil, as to extend to the certain production of whatever Events he hath will'd and decreed. For first, among the many Miracles related to be done in favour of the Israe∣lites, there is (I think) no one, that can be apodictically de∣monstrated to be repugnant to th' establisht Order of Nature: and then the Power of God being infinite, that

of Nature must be so too, because one and the same with the Power of God; but humane Understanding is finite, and consequently incapable to know how far the Laws of Nature extend themselves. In a word therefore, If by a Miracle in the general, you understand nothing else but a certain Work or Effect, the Causes of which cannot be explicated by men ignorant of the Principles of natural things: I acknowledge many such Miracles to have been done in all Ages, and among all Nations. Nay more, if by a Miracle you mean that, the Causes whereof transcend the Capacity even of the most acute and profound Philo∣sopher; I will not deny, but that among the many things related in the Scripture, as Miracles, some are found, that in this sence also may deserve that name; because I do not measure the Power of Nature by the unequal Line of humane Wit. But if you will have a Miracle to be such a rare Effect, which is absolutely above or (which re∣ally is all one) contrary to the Laws of Nature, or which cannot possibly follow from her fixt and immutable Or∣der: then I dare not believe that any such Miracle hath ever happen'd in Nature, lest I oppose God to God, that is, admit that God changes his own Decrees; which from the Perfection of the divine Nature, I know to be im∣possible. If you, candid Reader, know so too, I have al∣ready said more than is necessary to the defence of this innocent Discourse, and therefore acquiesce in hope of being rightly understood.
