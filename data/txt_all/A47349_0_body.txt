RIght worsh. it may seeme strange unto you that such an one as I who have bin judged an offender should be so bould as to go about to shelter any thing un∣der the shaddow of your protection, as it may seeme both to your selves and others, I now do it dedicating the insuing matter unto you, but give me leave I beseech you a little to excuse my bouldnes herein, being indu∣ced hereunto by these considerations.
Because the providence of God so ordered it to call me before you, to give an accompt of my last practice in this thing: (namely,) why I should take upon me to preach having never bin at the Ʋniver∣sities, nor received orders from the Bishops.
To the which question, J answered: that I conceived I had a warrant for what J did from the Scrip∣ture as (namely) 1 Pet. 4.10. where it is said,
as every man hath received the gift, so let th minister the same as good Stewards of the manifold graces of God, where it appeareth to be manifest, that as no man in the things of God is to speake above what he know∣eth, but according to the proportion of Faith, so like∣wise ought no man to hide any of the things of God which he hath received from God, but seasonably to de∣clare them to the glory of God and edification of others, least he be found in the number of those who hide their talent in a napkin, and therefore being thus by the providence of God called before you to give a reason of my action, and the hope that is in me, J made bold to pesent the perusall of what had then bin delivered unto your Worships.
The second Reason inducing me hereunto, is be∣cause it was the request of some of you before whom I was examined, upon the hearing of the Subject that I was upon, that you might see the notes of what was delivered upon it, which I promised to do, and have herein faithfully done it, not adding or detracting any thing from it so farre as possibly I can remember, ei∣ther in matter or manner, therefore have I made bold in this sort to present it to you.
The third and last reason is, because I apprehen∣ded by what I heard from you, that God hath given you in a good measure, knowledge by which you are able
to judge of things that differ, and therefore have I presented these few things unto you which God was pleased to helpe me to deliver, not from any opinion of any great or rare matter herein above others, but con∣ceiving they are the truth of God, and such as ought to be imbraced, I therefore tender them to your Worsh. and to all whom the providence of God shall direct them to, desiring your perusall hereof and tender con∣sideration hereupon, whether a man for doing this which J have done, have hereby so griavously trans∣gressed against God or man, that he might by either law of God or man o suffer imprisonment for it, and if David for doing his duty in the eyes of some appea∣red to be vile, said that then he would be more vile, the like may I say, if for doing my duty to God J am compted vile, I am like to appeare yet more vile, if God inable me to it, even till he shall change thi vile body of mine and make it like to his glorious body, who worketh all things according to the good plea∣sure of his owne will; acknowledging with that suf∣fering Apostle, and that with joy and comfort, though in a prison, that after that way which men call he∣resie, worship I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the Pro∣phets. Pardon J beseech, my bouldnesse, and if any termes have passed from me which either derogates
from your persons or placosi, inpute it to my weaknesse rather then to the least willfulnesse or disrespect, for the Lord is my witnesse, I desire to honour both, as like∣wise all men in place of authority, as I am bound by the word of God to do, and though I am accused and con∣demned for being at a conventicle, truely if praying for the King and Parliament and edifying one another in our most holy faith, be keeping conventicles, then J am guilty: but if a Conventicle be such a meeting as in the least measure is against any of these, then I detest it and abhorre it: thus desiring the Lord of mercies to fill you with the knowledge of himselfe, that you may be faithfull in your places of trust; your unwor∣thy servant shall remains
