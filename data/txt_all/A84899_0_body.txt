REVEREND SIRS,
COnsidering with my self, with a charitable and tender commiseration, the pestiferous and pernicious Heresies, Schisms, Divisions, and Sects, wherewith since the Apostles times the Christian (both Eastern and Western) Churches were ever continually infested, di∣stracted, and torn in peeces; I make no que∣stion but you will confesse, that the latter two rents, the One between the Christian-Protestants and Roman-Catho∣licks, the Other between us and the Evangelical-Lutherans, which in our Predecessours dayes sprung originally in Germany, then were dispersed over the face of the Universal-Occidental-Chri∣stian-World, and at this present are grown to the highest pitch of desolation and devastation of Christendom, were fomented with more unchristian and inhuman cruelty, bitternesse, calum∣nies, slanders, oppressions, persecutions, and effusion of blood, then ever you heard or read in Ecclesiastical Histories of any other Religion in the World: And consequently acknowledge, that such distractions and disorders of the Christian Church pro∣ceed from no other ground then from an unseasonable, unchari∣table, rash, presumptuous, and unjust judging and condemning one another. Wherefore, we shall do very well, exactly to
 search and inquire, which of these three principal, divided, and dissenting Churches is guilty or innocent of such a prejudicial Schism and Separation, to the end, that we may know and dis∣cern which side to imbrace and give assent unto, and which not. And that the true, undeniable, orthodoxal Doctrine and Reli∣gion of the true Evangelical Reformed Protestants may not be condemned and rejected by any incompetent Judge as false, er∣roneous, heretical, and damnable, in regard that Spiritual and Ecclesiastical matters are commonly as much obnoxious to ill managing, as Civil and Temporal: It is by all means expedient and requisite for us to repaire to such a Judge, who betwixt us and others may determine and decide the Controversie and Dif∣ference by an infallible Sentence, from which we cannot appeal. And whereas the Papists do attribute such full and absolute de∣termination to the Catholick Church, or, as they declare it them∣selves, to the Pope, as the Supream Head of the Church, either himself alone, or with assistance of a Councel of Cardinals, Bi∣shops, and Prelates, depending on him and representing the whole Universal Church: I am perswaded we with all Christian Protestants, cannot, nor will submit to any other Judge in matters of Religion, but to the Holy Scripture, or to the Lord our God him∣self, who in his Sacred Word hath prescribed his Will and Deci∣sion to the Christian Church, which we onely, closely and posi∣tively must adhere and stick unto. For this Volume of the Holy Scripture (I mean not any other Books, more, or lesse, then those that by inspiration of the Holy Ghost were written of the Prophets and Apostles and left to the Primitive Church, which from it were spred amongst all Nations and in the middest of darknesse and unfaithful heresies by Gods singular Providence preserved and in their original Tongues conveyed unto us) be∣ing the indubitable Word of God, whose Divine Power, Light, Vertue, and Operation all true Beleevers feel in their hearts and consciences, and containing (though not the decision of all Theological Questions and Controversies) yet all Articles of Faith and Doctrine, necessary for every true Christians Salvation; It is manifest, that the Church, or they that have the charge over it, whether they be called Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, or Divines and Teachers, or general Councels, have not any power and jurisdiction to decide, determine, and wrest the Doctrines to their arbitrary judgement and pleasure, but onely a ministe∣rial
 function to teach and demonstrate by Warrant from the Word of God whether and how they are decided in it; neither to force their doubtful and undecided Opinions upon any man sub Anathemate or Excommunication, unlesse he should reject the Word of God in any fundamental and necessary Article of Faith or plain Declaration thereof, or cry up his own errone∣ous and controverted opinions, interpretations, consequences, and inferences for the Word of God it self and necessary Ar∣ticles of Faith to the disturbance and distraction of the Christian Church.
And this is that the Papists cast continually into the Lutherans and Reformed Protestants teeth, That notwithstanding they still refer themselves to the perfect and infallible Rule of the Word of God; yet for all this they will be themselves infallible Judges by obstructing and imposing their own particular expositions and inferences on others. The Lutherans indeed, especially which are called Lutherani rigidi the grosser sort (who are so strictly addicted Formulae Concordiae Saxonicae, that they bind not onely their Faith and Doctrine unto it, but also all others that dissent from them in their particular interpretations and opi∣nions, principally in the Point of Consubstantiation and Omni∣presence of Christs Body and its oral manducation, by excluding them from the Communion of the Christian Church and de∣priving them of Publick Offices and Dignities,) as long as they do obstinately persist in their arrogant judging and condemning, will have a very hard task to clear themselves of this charge. The Vindication of the Protestant Reformed Churches, how that they onely depend on the Word of God and not on any mans interpretation and opinion, much lesse presume to impose them on others as necessary unto Salvation, but impart and per∣mit to every one the due Libertie of Conscience without trans∣gressing the true Limits and Rules of Gods Truth and the Chri∣stian Charity, hath been of late sufficiently and punctually for the true and better information of them that are misinformed, exhibited in high Dutch (by D. John Bergius, Chaplaine to His Highnesse the Prince Elector of Brandenbourg, Author of this Treatise, One of the best Learned Divines Germany at this pre∣sent affordeth, a primitive Catholick Christian and down-right Protestant,) in such a plain and perspicuous way, that even the most ignorant and unlearned, who are not able to peruse great
 Volumes, may palpably see and perceive the falsehood and slanders that are laid at all Christian Protestants doors: And with∣all, since the Reformed Protestant Churches cannot hope for any Ecclesiastical Peace and Unitie both in Church and Common∣wealth, whilest the vehemency and fiercenesse in judging and condemning of the said Papists and Lutherans is not appeased and mitigated. He representeth and declareth to them an Infallible Apostolical Direction and Rule in general, what and how far men are bound in conscience to judge and not to judge in matters of Religion, and then by way of application; How far they ought to judge the Roman-Catholicks and Lutherans in their Do∣ctrine and Religion, or to separate themselves from them, or to reform them.
Which Treatise having been so happy to peruse by the com∣munication of my worthy Friend and Countrey-man Master Jaspar Godeman (whom I always in his frequent conversation perceived a singular Well-wisher to an Ecclesiastical Unitie,) I have immediately betaken my self to the Translation thereof, much animated and incouraged by his and divers others good advice, accompanied with these two pregnant Motives:
The One: That this subject is the most necessary and profi∣table of all Theological Controversies and Questions, that now adayes are in agitation, and may much conduce, if not to the advancement of an Universal Peace and Unitie of all Churches (which though it was always earnestly desired of men truely zealous and Christians, so that Learned Calvin offering his Ser∣vice therein to that worthy man Doctor Cranmer, said, It would not grieve him to saile over ten Seas to such a purpose, yet pro∣ved a work of insuperable difficultie and altogether impossible in mens eyes,) at least to promote the Christian agreement and reconciliation or mitigation of the distractions of all Kingdoms, Principalities, and Free-States that have abandoned the Super∣stitions and pernicious Leaven of the Romish Church; For the effecting whereof not onely the Protestant Churches and Divines in Germany have had in former times several Conferences at Mar∣purg, Wittenberg, and of late at Leipzig; but also at these pre∣sent times that Famous and Reverend Divine Master John Durey (first stirred up by that excellent Instrument Master James Gode∣man, Father of the worthy Gentleman aforementioned, One of His Majesty the King of Sweden's Privy Counsellor and Presi∣dent
 of his Court of Appellations in the Precinct of Prussia, and then seconded with hearty wishes tnd prayers of many pious and learned Divines in England, France, and Scotland,) hath these fifteen yeers to my knowledge, imployed his indefatigable en∣deavours and singular industry in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Low-Countreys, and not without hopeful successe, having at length prevailed so much with the Lutherans, especially in Sweden, that they not onely have given over their slanders and calumnia∣tions in the Pulpit, but also are contented to be called Evange∣lical Protestants, agreeing with us in the mean time in the name, and walking by the same Rule so far as they have already at∣tained till God reveal unto them what is remaining.
The Other Motive is, That also this subject would be most seasonable for these tempestuous and turbulent times, which the Church and State of England at this present groaneth and la∣boureth under, and which, if we will seriously inquire into, doth proceed originally from no other cause then uncharitable∣nesse and acrimony in judging and condemning one another: And consequently (Reverend Sirs) it will be useful and pro∣fitable for every one in particular, whereby (being perad∣venture carried away with rashnesse and vehemency, as natu∣rally all men are inclined and prone unto, to judge and con∣demn others as unfaithful, that erre rather out of humane weaknesse and meer ignorance, then obstinacy and malice in in∣different matters, and in the circumstance) much good he may here learn and be advised how to moderate and temperate his passions and affections with more charity and peaceablenesse and stedfastly maintain the benefit of the substance, viz. the Univer∣sal Christian saving Faith and sincere love and obedience of Christ, as the onely fundamental and necessary Doctrine unto Salvation, lest in rashly, presumptuously, and rigorously con∣demning others, he may be inexcusable and condemn himself: And contrarywise, being either thrust out of the way, which the Lord our God hath commanded him to walk in, or falsly and contumeliously judged, slandered, reviled, excommuni∣cated, and persecuted for the true Orthodoxal Doctrine, Faith, and Religion by an incompetent Judge on Earth, he may know, without beleeving and obeying their words, and offending thereby both his own and other true beleeving or erring con∣sciences, how to appeal first to the Word of God it self and una∣nimous
 consent of the Primitive Apostolical Church, or to any legal and impartial Ecclesiastical Convocation, Synod, or Con∣sistory, or if he cannot be heard there, to the Supream Judge in Heaven himself, being the onely Law-giver, who is able to save and destroy, and in his good time will judge those Judges themselves, and pronounce a definitive Sentence against all He∣resies, Schisms, and Divisions, and establish an Universal Har∣mony and Unitie in the Christian Church.
Whereas now these two Motives have induced me to this slender endeavour, without regard to any other interest or re∣spect but that which might be conducible to the advancement of an Ecclesiastical Peace and Unitie amongst Evangelical Prote∣stant Churches, lest the Wel-wishers and Furtherers thereof might not be too long debarr'd from the lustre and use of so rare a Jewel; I thought fit and expedient to dedicate it to your Pa∣tronage, as being suteable and adequate to your zeal and piety (relying herein upon Sir Edwin Sandys judgement delivered in his Book called A View of the state of Religion in the Western parts of the World, pag. 173. where he writeth thus: The end of the dif∣ferences between the Evangelical Protestant Churches will be, that their enemies shall laugh, when themselves shall have cause to weep, unlesse the graciousnesse of God stir up some worthy Princes of renown and reputa∣tion on both sides to interpose their Wisdom, Industry, and Authority for the uniting these Factions, or at least for reconciling and composing those differences in some tolerable sort; A work of immortal fame and desert, and worthy of none but them of whom this wicked base World is not worthy: And hoping that this weak attempt of my labour, though some of the Vulgar sort will perhaps either carelesly or censoriously entertain it, will be neverthelesse as favourably accepted by you, as it is affectionately and heartily tendred by
REVEREND SIRS,

London the 23th of March 1646.
