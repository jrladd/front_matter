THe Reformation of England, is the great expectation of the world, I thinke I may say of Angels, as well as men; and the Parliament of England, under God, is the great hope of the Christian world, to bring this refor∣mation about. If any would set himselfe to stu∣dy abstractly, how God might prepare a compa∣ny of men to carry on such a worke, he would not easily finde out any thing, which God hath not already fitted the Honourable Houses with. Great pressures to helpe to make them humble before their meeting: Manifold dangers all along from the beginning of their meeting to helpe keepe them humble: A mighty concurrence of provi∣dence to necessitate their meeting together: And an unparalleld overruling of hearts, for their con∣tinuance together, without limitation of time, o∣other then their owne prudence should deter∣mine:
A watchfull eye, and a strong hand, to preserve them from all sorts of attempts, to dissolve their meeting: Marvellous and manifold actings of Gods almighty power and richgrace, in making their ene∣mies fall before them, notwithstanding their fre∣quent expectations, and most probable hopes of swallowing them up suddenly, and in making the people every where to stoope to every part of re∣formation by them promoted, notwithstanding all their habituated and doted on customes to the contrary; the most solemne engagements to carry the worke on for God, and accordingly to God, that are to be found upon earth, or are directed by heaven: A spirit of reformation in the hearts of ma∣ny thousands throughout the Kingdome, and more particularly neer unto the place of their sit∣ing, breathing out prayers and supplications to God for them day and night, with giving of thanks, that the reformation may prosper in their hands, and be perfected by their hands: And finally, most frequent entercourses between God and them, by his sending to them, (and even direct∣ing them to call to themselves) his servants in great variety and frequency; to pray with them daily, to fast and pray with them monthly, (besides extraordinary dayes of humiliation, and to pray and give thanks with them upon extraordinary dayes
of thanksgiving, and these extraordinary dayes both of the one and the other sort being not a few, put them altogether) and upon all these publike and solemne occasions, to speake to them in the name of God, words of direction & incou∣ragement, and all this as a joynt body together, with the advantage of having every affecting Sermon perpetuated to them, by Printing such as they see cause, orapprove; (while in the meane time the severall members have the opportunity of con∣stant hearing from God every Sabbath, and many of them every morning.) And with all this to have a selected number of men, csen by themselves, to attend years together, meerly  giving them advice about this reformation; may I not now say in the close of all, what could have been done more for such a company of men, to make them willing and a∣ble to do Gods whole work for his Church and people, for a full and perfect reformation?
And is not this your story (honourable and worthy?) is it not the manifest story of Gods providence toward the Parliament of England? And what doth he now expect from you? Or what may we expect further from him? Surely from him, for my part I can expect no less, but that his intents are (though yet through some further difficulties perhaps) to carry your spirits, and the spirits of the whole Parlia∣ment
strongly and powerfully on, to finish this so blessed a work. He hath pardon, & grace, & wis∣dome, and strength enough to answer and over∣come all that can be said or thought to the con∣trary; in this perswasion I have divers years lived, and I hope in it I shall dye, if I must dye before the work be perfected; this perswasion and hope, as it directed me to choose for you this text, which is here discoursed upon, so it commanded me to speake what I could understand God ex∣pected, & doth still expect from you: wherein as for the generall, I am sure I have pointed you to the whole councell of God; so for the particulars I blesse God that I can say, your selves have ma∣nifestly owned divers of them, in making some Ordinances accordingly, and that addes to my confidence and comfort, that all other things of Gods will towards you, shall be fulfilled by you, according to his will from time to time; in which work, both by prayers, and all faithfull endeavours in my station, I am, and shall ever be in him,
