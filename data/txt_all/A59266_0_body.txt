Honoured Sir,
IT is no small inconvenience of the late defici∣ency of the Coin, that it hath occasion'd so much unprofitable Discourse; that in all Companies, almost nothing is talked of but Money: There is a Divine Chymistry, and Holy Art of Ex∣tracting out of any Common Subject, some Hea∣venly and Spiritual Matter: It were well if we could take occasion from the multitude of words about the late debased, and now regulated Coin, to affect our own and others Hearts with the depra∣vity of our natures, and the necessity of their re∣covery by Grace; with the Corruption of the Land, and what hope of Reformation; whatever private Persons may do towards it, at least by earnest Pray∣er, and by beginning at home: Church-Reformation is much promoted by Family-Religion, and that must begin with personal Dedication. It is a true saying, Corruptio optimi est pessima, next to the Corruption of the Ministry, that of the Gentry is most to be bewail'd: How sad is it when they who should help forward the Reformation, do themselves most

need it! But as when the Coin was most corrup∣ted, there was always some good, so hath the Lord yet a Remnant in this Land, and the Lord add unto them (how many soever they be) an hun∣dred fold: When I have heard of your Zeal for God and his Interest in publick and private Stations, I could not but say, I have known few a∣mongst the great Ones like minded: It is upon this account that I have made bold to set your Name before this Sermon, that whereas I have not the vanity to think that it should come into the hands of many (if any) of those Noble Patriots to whom I have addrest my self in the Body of it; the substance of that part of it may be communicated to them of your acquaintance in your Familiar converse with them, but in your own more efficacious words, and with greater enlargements than the necessity of my keeping within the narrow bounds of a Metaphor would admit of in this Discourse: And yet I have said so much to those whom I so much reverence, that a modest shame obligeth me to withdraw my Name, lest it should be known to come from so mean a Person; and I shall seek other ways to make it known, how much I am,
