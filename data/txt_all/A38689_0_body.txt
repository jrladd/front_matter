My Lord,
I Cou'd not have wish'd
my self more fortunate
then I have been in the
success of this Poem:
The Writing of it was
a means to make me
known to your Lord∣ship;
The Acting of it has lost me no Re∣putation;
And the Printing of it has now
given me an opportunity to shew how much
I honour you.
I here dedicate it, as I have long since dedi∣cated
my self, to your Lordship: Let the
humble Love of the Giver make you set
some value upon the worthless Gift: I hope
it may have some esteem with others, because

the Author knows how to esteem you, whose
Knowledg moves admiration, and Goodness
love, in all that know you. But I design
this a Dedication, not a Panegerick; not
to proclaim your Virtues to the World,
but to shew your Lordship how firmly
they have oblig'd me to be,
My Lord,
