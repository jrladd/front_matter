ERuctavit Cor me∣um verbum bo∣num; Dico ego opera mea Regi, Psal. 45.1. My heart is Indit∣ing of a good matter, concerning
the King; Divine providence disposing my Meditations to∣wards so sacred a subject, directs the Dedication thereof according to the Princely Pro∣phet Davids pattern. Dico o∣pera mea Regi. Quod ausus sum tantae Majestatis Princi∣pem tantillo adire munusculo That so mean a person should approach the presence of so mighty a Prince, with so poor a present may be accounted high presumption; yet 'tis storied, that Jupiter was pleased with the course fare of a poor person.
Baucis in hospitium magnum acce∣pisse Tonantem,
Atque illi insuaves apposuisse dapes, &c.
Ʋnder the law he that had not a Lamb to sacrifice, was per∣mitted
to offer a Turtle Dove, or pair of young Pigeons, and in the Gospel a small Mite ren∣ders a poor Widdow Liberall, Aeschines when he saw his fel∣low Schollers presenting great gifts to Socrates their Master, being destitute of such a present, presented himself, professing to be wholy devoted to his Master, which Socrates ac∣cepted as the chiefest Gift. There is nothing worth your Majesties acceptance in the po∣wer of Your Highnesse meanest subject, Parasitical adulation I know unpleasing to your pru∣dent Majesty, and hateful to mine own Nature, my Life and what else can be accounted dear
us{que} ad aras, I have bin alwaies and still shall be most freely ready to sacrifice. 'Tis said of Caesr that surely nature meant him for a Conqueror, when she gave him both such courage and such courtesie which put Marius into a muze (saying) that he that dust speak to him, was ignorant of his greatnesse, and he that durst not was so of his goodnesse.
The incomparable Candor of your Majesties sweetest disposi∣tion gives me incouragement humbly to implore Your Maje∣sties princely pardon for this presumption, and to vouchsafe your Highnesse Gracious accep∣tance of this unpolished piece,
penner whilst my Soule (though inlarged with surpassing Love and Joy for my Sove∣raigns safe and happy Resto∣ration, (for which my prayers to Heaven were frequent and constant, my Tounge and Pen Head, Heart, and Hands ac∣cording to my best ability not wanting) yet was much streight¦ned with perplexity of spirit, by reason of long imprisonment and distracted with distemper of Mind and Estate alwaies at∣tending the sad Condition of Prisoners! Happily herein somewhat not unworthy your Majesties serious consideration at present) may be observed: & I hope I have herein delivered
nothing touching your Majesty but what I have received from the dictates of that Good Di∣vine spirit which hath directed me through this whole discourse and what I faithfully believe will in due time be fully ac∣complished, my faith herein be∣ing in part confirmed not only by those propheticall presages in this Tract specified, and by Dreams & Visions (which how∣soever by some may be accoun∣ted vain or deceitful) yet I have often proved, & since found re∣ally to come to pass, and receive a plenary effect touching your Majesties return and other matters of Moment: But also by an irresistible and invincible pressure of spirit, to publish
what in this tract, I have writ∣ten; so that I may truly say with the Prophet Jeremiah, 'Twas a fire in my bones, and I could not supresse it, but by Divine impulsion of spirit, was importu∣ned and prest to declare what by divine designment I believe is determined touching your Maje∣sties exaltation not only to be the most potent Christian Prince in Europe, But to be the phenix of this Age, and the most Famous and Illustrious potentate in the Ʋniverse. This I shall be ready to avouch against the most criti∣call carpers murmuring and de∣tracting Momusses, and seeming zealous Zoylusses; and 'tis pro∣bable some pernicious Pashurs
wil conspire with other confede∣rates cogitare cogitationes to devise devises against Jeremiah and be ready percutere eum lingua, to smite him with the tongue, Jer. 18.18. Their malice shall render them nothing more then Pashurs reward, but a new name of terror and shame, Ma∣gor missabib signifying fear round about, we have of late unhappily had too many pashurs who cannot abide to hear any truth spoken, such as wil not hear any good declared or prosperity presaged to their Prince, how pious & worthy soever, but are ready rather to calumniate; let all such seditions Shebaes, Cursing Shimei's, Railing Rabshekeis,
& rebellious Korahs know, that though they rail & rage, against their lawful Soveraign against whom they ought not to entertain so much as an evil thought, he that sits in Heaven will not on∣ly deride but in the end destroy all such disturbing Traytors, & will establish your Majesties Throne in righteousness, cause your Highnesse Crown to flourish and cloth your Enemies with shame & confusion in conclusion. The King of Kings hath set his King on high upon his holy Hill, his Sion, over his People; & sent an heavenly Herald to proclaim his present power, and declare a future inlargement of his Domi∣nion; A glorious Star, or rather
flial Constellation, the Pleiades Charles Waine, shining bright∣lie on the day of your Majesties Nativity, when your Majesties late pious Father of blessed me∣mory came to offer his sacrisice of praise as Incense at the Alter of St. Paul. That Celesti∣all Embassadour was sent to certifie Gods acceptance of that sacrifice, and to confirm the certainty of your Majesties fu∣ture Exaltation, to transcendent honour by divine designment preordained. E Caelis tanti beneficii mittitur nunciusquia nemo in terras illius magnitu∣dinem nec intelligebat, nec credebat (as was said of our Saviours star appearing upon
his Nativity) Caelestium mu∣nerum merito caelestis nunci∣us est, the people neither under∣standing nor believing the great∣nesse and goodnesse of the bene∣fit bestowed on them, an heaven∣ly nuntio is therefore sent to assure them of both. I have wuch more to speak concerning Your sacred Majesty who may well be resembled to the Golden Gandlestick, and the two Re∣nowned Dukes, your Majesties Royal Brethren to the two Olive Trees on the right and left side thereof Zech. 4. But least I should incurre the censure of the City of Myndas for making my Porch to large, I shall crave your Majesties pardon, and Conclude
with the prayer of that Princely Prophet your Majesties most pi∣ous Father, I pray God blesse Your Majesty and establish Your Kingdoms in righteousness, your soul in true Religion, and your honour in the love of God and your People, which is and shall be the dayly and hearty prayer of
Most Gracious SOVERAIGN.
