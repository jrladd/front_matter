RIGHT HONORABLE,
THis euery way so meane
a Booke, and so vnmea∣surably
disproportioned
to your HONORS emi∣nent
ranke and merite,
I durst neuer haue presu∣med
to haue cast, no not
so high as your feete, for the first publike to∣ken

of my wholly deouted seruice, and hum∣ble
dutie; but that my selfe being totally, true∣ly
and most deseruedly yours, any thing that
is in me, or shall euer come from me, little or
much, and of what nature soeuer, must needs
acknowledge that dependance. And when I
remembred, the Earnest is euer the least part,
yea often no part, of the Payment, (neyther
do I here intend more) I had some hope your
true Noblenes would not altogether reiect
it. Vouchsafe, then my most noble Lord, to
suffer it to passe as a meere Earnest, or rather
an Entayle to your Lord-ship, of whatsoeuer
I shall at any time hereafter, be able more hap∣pily
to bring forth, for your seruice and plea∣sure.
Which (regardles as it is) if it may but
escape the imputation of an offence, it is the
highest ayme of him, that neyther desires,
nor is worthy longer to liue, then he shall
giue the world notice to his vtmost, how
much he is,
