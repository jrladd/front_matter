I Cannot denie but in my youth, among other weakenesses, I yeelded to the ten∣tation of printing Sermons, at request of such as had a power over me. But since I grew both an elder man, and a poore retired Vicar in an obscure angle of the Countrey, I re∣solu'd against any more such aduentures. But be∣hold your vehement entreaties (Mr. Ellis & Mr. G.) and charging me with my respecting Gods Glory, haue drawen these poore Meditations abroad: yet with this protestation, that I desire (if it were pos∣sible) no eye might be taken of from richer stuffe and worthier Bookes (wherewith the world a∣bounds) to looke on this, saue only yours, where∣in I haue euer yet found so much, & so vndeserued fauour, that peraduenture euen for that affectio∣nate fauors sake, this will seeme to you better then in deed it is. being only plaine matter and not ela∣borate in stile or ornaments of quotations. With it (if that be any amends) I dedicate my selfe and my best endeuours to rest at your Seruice. And so praying for the continuance of all Gods blessings vpon you all. I remaine
