GOod Sir, I haue been sollici∣ted by sundry well affected ones, not to suffer this Ser∣mon (being a forewarning of this famous Citie especially, and whole kingdome also) to die in obli∣uion. As, many elaborate Sermons, im∣mediately after sore labour & trauaile they are brought into the world, they are reuiued (perhaps) with your accep∣tance and applause; but their life and being in mens memories, doth scarce equalize the life of that beast, whereof both Aristotle and Plutarch doe write, called Ephemeron, the length of whose
life was but for the space of one day, as the name signifieth.
Amongst many titles, which the Lord in holy Scripture hath vouchsa∣fed vs his Ministers, hee hath called vs Watchmen. Wherefore I being called to this great place, and appointed to be set (this were) in the Watch-tower: during my allotted time of watching, I haue carefully indeauored to warne the peo∣ple, and to forewarne them of those euils, which their sinnes are ready to hale vpon them.
Howsoeuer the subiect of this Ser∣mon doth concerne this whole most honourable Corporation, and especial∣ly the supreme Officers, who in their seuerall places should (as Moses) stand in the gap, & with the Pruning-hooke of Iustice, cut downe bundles of vices, that so the incursion of Gods wrath may be stopped. Yet I haue presumed (right worthy Sir) to single out your selfe, and to affixe onely your Name to
the Dedication; both for the good re∣port which I haue receiued concer∣ning your pious zeale in the discharge of that great Place and Office, where∣in lately you were imployed; and (I hope) that others in eminent places and offices will imitate your vertues; As also to testifie my thankefulnesse, for some expressions of your Loue to∣wards me. Accept (I beseech you) of this my good intendment, who shall bee euer ready to demonstrate my selfe
