MADAM,
ALthough the eminence of your well known worth will admit no addi∣tion from any expressions, that I by my tongue or pen can make, yet I hope your Ladiship will give me leave, as well as I can, to improve the evidence of mine own unfeig∣ned thankfulnesse by a publick acknowledgement of the dutifull respect, wherein I stand obliged unto you, for your many undeserved favours unto me and mine, whereof I may sooner cease to be, then suffer ingratefull oblivion to blot the memorie out of my mind. Nor will it (I am confident) be any grief of heart, or occasion of of∣fence unto your Ladiship, that I take this opportunitie, at once both to tell the world how much I am indebted unto you, and to intitle your Ladiship in a speciall man∣ner unto a part of his works, of whom you not only had a reverend esteem whilest he lived, but likewise still pre∣serve his memorie as precious. I doubt not but you, and manie others, have long agoe thought it high time that he, whose happie hand was an instrument to bring many posthume works of Mr. Perkins to the Presse, and af∣ter
to reduce the scattered pieces into three large ve∣lumes, should have the like measure measured unto him again, wherewith he had meted to another. And so it had been, but that there were some obstructions in the passage to the Presse, the womb of printed books. Those rubs being now removed, and his Expositions of foure select Psalmes readie to be offered to the publike view, I am bold to present this unto you, and under your name to commend it to the use of all those children of the Church, who enjoying the comforts are willing to main∣tain the credit of those great priviledges, that are gran∣ted to it, and would be as loth to forfeit, as they are to forgoe their Charter. Amongst whom your Ladiships sincere affection and zeale to religion entitles you to so high an esteem, that they unto whom you are best knowne will soonest conceive, that it is not resolution onely, but reason also, which moveth me to bind your name as a frontlet on the forehead of this book, and to underwrite my selfe.
