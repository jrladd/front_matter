May it please your Grace,
TIs not the sublime
condition in which
you are, nor the

eminent, and great Ho∣nours
with which you de∣servedly
shine, (as a bright
Star, of the first Magni∣tude,
in our little World,)
that hath induced me to
address this ensuing Dis∣course
to you; but the
great, and excellent know∣ledge
of Natural Be∣ings
your Grace hath ac∣quired
by a constant, and
curious Anatomizing of all
sort of Concrets in your
Laboratory; a way cer∣tainly
the most likely to
give you a faithful and so∣lid
account of the Na∣ture

of things, by disco∣vering
to you the real prin∣ciples
of which they are
constituted. This it is,
which made me conclude,
I should have done a great
injustice, had I put this
Tract under any other
Protection than yours.
And indeed, at whose feet
can a Subject of this Na∣ture
be so fitly plac'd as at
your Grace's, you being so
great an Experimental
Philosopher?
But lest I prove tedi∣ous,
I will conclude this
Epistle, with assuring

you, that not only this Book,
but the Author of it, are
both Dedicated to your
Graces Service, by him
that in all Humility sub∣scribes
himself,
My Lord,
