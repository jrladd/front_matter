My Lord,
ALthough my condition doth not afford me a Heroick heart, it gives me nevertheless such a one, as

not to be forgetfull of my duty. During a whole tenne years im∣ployment in your house, I have found the secret how to make meates ready neatly and dainti∣ly. I dare say that I have exer∣cised this profession with a great approbation of the Princes, of the Marshals of France, and of an infinite number of persons of quality, who did cherish your Table in Paris, and in the Armies, where you have forced Fortune to grant to your Virtue some Offices worthy of your courage. I think, that the publique ought to receive the profit of this ex∣perience of mine, to the end that it may owe unto you all the utilitie, which it will re∣ceive thereby. I have therefore set down in writing what I have

so long practised in the honour of your service, and have made a small Book of it, bearing the title of the Clerk of your Kit∣chin. But, as all what it doth contain, is but a lesson, which the desire of pleasing you hath caused me to learne, I have thought that it ought to be ho∣noured with your name, and that without sinning against my duty, I could not seek for it a mightier prop than yours: It is a token of the passion which I have alwaies had, and which I shall have all my life time for your service. Therefore, my Lord, use your accustomed ge∣nerosity, doe not despise it, though it be unworthy of you. Consider that it is a treasure of the Sauces, the taste whereof did

once please you; and, to con∣clude, that it is the Master-peece comming from the hands of him, who will bee all his life time,
My Lord,
