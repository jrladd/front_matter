My Lord,
NOW when the whole Kingdom is resounding with the loudest Acclamations of Joy for that late Felicity, which our Gra∣cious KING has vouchsaft us, in be∣stowing upon us such a Chancellor, as equally answers all our former, and even puts to silence the most eager of our pre∣sent Wishes; I may (I doubt not) pre∣sume
 upon a favourable Smile to be deign'd this small Mite of Congratula∣tion, which my Zealous, tho poor En∣deavours throngs in with the publick Croud.
And altho such Addresses, upon the like Occasion, use rather to be interpret∣ed by all the environing World, as no∣thing else but the insinuative and design∣ing Streins of Flatery and Complement, and such Courtly Shadows, as only fol∣low and await upon Greatness and Pre∣ferment: Yet the universal evidence of real exultancy which appears because of Your Lordships Promotion (whereby 'tis hard to distinguish whether every one resents more the new Accession to Your Lordships Glory, or That to the Happi∣ness which he shares in the common ad∣vantage of his whole Nation), takes off all reasonable suspition of any such base and unworthy intendments from Those, which nothing can restrain from the bold∣ness of pressing forward to express the in∣genuous acknowledgments, It does every where engage. And he that would aim
 at accoasting Your Lordship with any ca∣joling or adulatory methods, behov'd, not only to be ignorant how ungrateful all such are to that sincerest Modesty, which is the very Enamel and Decorement of those other radiant Vertues whereby Your Lordship is so eminently ennobled and adorned; but also to contrive new Raptures for his Blandishments, which never yet any under that Name were ac∣customed unto, when to say of Your Lordship but what You justly deserve, would entirely exhaust whatever has hi∣therto been soar'd the most highly in the wonted Eulogies and Praises: Neither of which I shall ever be guilty.
But, My Lord, I presume that towards a Year agoe it was made known to Your Lordship, that I was design'd to prostrate the first of my Labours at Your Lord∣ships feet, there to show with what Ve∣neration Your Lordships Vertues and Noble Learning (which mutually bor∣rows from, and adds Lustre unto These, and Your Noble Self) did overtake a Man, whom no other bonds could tye
 to any such Admiration and Regard; as never yet having been so far honoured, as to be but once more seen in the face by Your Lordship, than any of those nume∣rous Throngs which constantly flock with ravishment to behold the Ornament and Darling of the Scottish Nation. And so it is still the Earl of Perth, whose Name I-have dar'd to prefix unto these Papers, and not the Chancellor; or only the Chancellor, because it is the Earl of Perth that is He.
That our present happiness in Your Lordship may continue while a sero in Coelum redeas be at once wholly applyed and verified, is undoubtedly the fervent Prayer of every one, who loves the True Religion, his KING, and Countrey, and own self; but especially of,
My Lord,
