MY Friends,
As you were particularly in my thoughts upon the writing of these sheets; so is it not less my desire to make you particular in their publication.
Many have been the Objections with which you frequently have beset me on this account; but not with that success I hope their Answers will have with you. My matter, stile and method speak not the least premeditation or singularity, but that simplicity and truth which plainly show the affe∣ctionate sincerity of my heart, and best wishes for your true happiness; that from Defendants of vain, foolish, proud and wanton Customs, which exer∣cise the minds of men and women below the ex∣cellencies of Immortality (the highest end of their Creation) you may become Disciples of that self-denying Jesus, who first brought that great felici∣ty to light, and gladly Sacrifice your all, as but your reasonable service, in order to so glorious a Reward.

By which you may be lead into that temperance, piety and self-denial, that will render you so many noble Witnesses, a∣gainst the folly, lust, and gross intemperance of the Age, and unquestionably entitle you to Honor, Glory, Immortality and Eternal Life, then which, as there can be nothing more truly excellent; so, not any thing more earnestly desir'd on your ac∣count by
