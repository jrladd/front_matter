My Lord:
BEing pressed by the desire of the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen of the City of London, notified under the hand of the Clerke of that Court, to print a Sermon which I lately preached at Pauls; I was willing rather to deny mine owne judgement, which prohibited, then theirs, who called for the publication of the same.
Such as it is, I presume to offer it unto your Lordship, and under your name to the worlds view, because I know that the Argument there∣of suiteth with that noble disposition which
your Lordship upon all occasions expresseth, to promote Peace, Love, and Christian unity in these distracted destroying times. Besides, I was glad to catch at any opportunity, to make some publick Record, of those many great unde∣served favours which your Lordship is pleased to heap upon me, and oblige me in the strongest bonds of thankfulnesse and duty, ever to be, and appeare to the uttermost,
