I Haue the rather presumed humbly to offer vnto your Ho∣nor the dedication of this little Poëme, for that the noble and vertuous Gentlewoman of whom it is written, was by match neere alied, and in affection greatly deuo∣ted vnto your Ladiship. The occasion why J wrote the same, was aswell the great good fame which J heard of her deceassed, as the particular good will which J beare vnto her husband Master Arthure Gorges, a louer of learning and vertue, whose house as your Ladiship by mariage hath honoured, so doo J finde the name of them by many notable records, to be of great antiquitie in this Realm; and such as haue euer borne themselues with honorable
reputation to the world, and vnspotted loyaltie to their Prince and Countrey: besides so linially are they descended from the Howards, as that the Lady Anne Howard, eldest daughter to Iohn Duke of Norfolke, was wife to Sir Edmund, mo∣ther to Sir Edward, and grandmother to Sir VVil∣liam and Sir Thomas Gorges Knights. And therefore J doo assure my selfe that no due honour done to the white Lyon, but will be most gratefull to your Ladiship, whose husband and children doe so neerely participate with the bloud of that noble familie. So in all duetie J recommend this Pam∣phlet, & the good acceptance thereof to your hono∣rable fauour and protection. London this first of January. 1591.
