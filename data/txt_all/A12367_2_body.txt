HEere thou hast the Ser∣mons which haue bin of∣ten desired, because of the matter fit for this Citie. One sayth, that he would neuer speake to Vsurers, and Bribe∣mongers, but when they be vpon their death beds: for he which liueth by sin, resolueth to sin, that he may liue. But when he goeth to hanging, Iudas will Mat. 27. 4. say, I haue sinned. If I speake not to Vsurers vppon their death-bed, yet I speake to Vsurers which shall lye vppon their death-bed. Three things do giue me hope. One is, that all harts are in the hands of God, to call them at what houre Act. 9. 15. he list, and therefore Saul may become an Apostle. The next is, that the third crow doth waken moe then the former,



and therefore after the crowing of o∣ther, this crow may happily be heard. The last is, that there is no sinne, but some men haue bin reclaimed from it, and so may Vsurers from their sinne.
Therefore goe my booke like Dauid against Goliah, and sight the Lords 1. Sam. 17. 51. battells against Vsurers. The Lord giue that successe to his doctrine in these leaues, that it may consume Vsurers, as Ioshuah droue out the Chananites before him. If I could take but this one Iosh. 5. 1. weede out of the Londoners Garden, I were answered for my health and my strength spent amongst them. Reade with thy best minde, and thou shal pro∣fit more.
