My Lord,
YOur Lordship's favourable acceptance of this following Sermon, and Command∣ing it to be Printed (for such force Your de∣sire
carries with me) have at length made me adventure to present it to Your Lordship's View, with hope, that what upon hearing had Your approbation, will upon sight pass how∣ever for allowable.
After Your Lordship's declaring in fa∣vour of it, I am little concern'd what Re∣ception 'twill find abroad, believing with some reason that what such a Judgment dis∣approves not, can not easily displease the Good and Candidly Judicious, and 'tis the good opi∣nion of such only I have value for. If some few of my Brethren, by the Perusal of this plain Discourse, may be in the least measure aided towards making themselves and others Better, I have my end in it.
To contribute the best I was able, to excite a greater sence of Religion amongst us, by ani∣mating the Ministers of it to display its
Beauty in their Lives, as well as their Dis∣courses, was the Desgn I proposed to my self. And what ever the Success be, I have the satisfaction that I did not take my aim amiss, and how unproportionable soever the means be I used; the defect was not from any want of Good will to lend the best assistance I was able; Prompted thereunto by a Spark of that Zeal for the success and prevalency of true Christian Piety against the Licentious∣ness of this present Age, that glows in the Hearts of all good men, and that Your Lord∣ship in Particular is all on fire with. This my Lord it is that makes You Venerable, this gains You the Hearts of all good men, makes You awful to the bad. This will make You a Publick Blessing whilst You live, Embalm Your Memory when dead? Nay, make You live after Death on Earth, in the Hearts and
Memories of all good men that knew You, in Heaven in the Joyes of our Lord. That God would long preserve Your Lordship for the Benefit of his Church, and make all Your Endeavours for its Prosperity eminently suc∣cessful, is the Hearty Prayer of
My Lord,
