GENTLEMEN,
IN my Preface before the Fifth Book of Ayres and Songs lately published, I gave several Reasons for my Reso∣lution of forbearing for the future to make any more Collections of that nature, leaving it to my Son, and Mr. Carr's Son; but having for some years past gathered into one Book divers new Catches, Songs, and Glees, much like those in my Musical Companion, which I did only to recreate my self with my Musical Friends, I am prevailed with at their request (and for common benefit) to make them public; and because of their Similitude, give them the Title of the Second Part of the Musical Companion. The First Part contains about 100 Rounds and Catches, 6 Dialogues, 33 Ayres and Songs for two Voices, 60 choice Ayres, Songs, and Glees for three Voices, and 12 Ayres and Songs for four Voices. This Second Part contains 70 new Catches and Songs for two, three, and four Voices, many of them were printed from the Authors own Copies, and the rest from the truest Copies I could procure; however it is probable, that by often transcribing some Errors may have crept in, which has occasion'd me to print a smaller number than usual, thereby to make way for a second and more correct Impression, hoping such Gentle∣men as find any Errors will be so kind as to rectifie them, by sending me some truer Copies. Some faults there are in the words, which an intelligent Musical Reader will easily perceive, and mend with a Pen. I am,
GENTLEMEN,
