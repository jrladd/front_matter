Sir,
I Here present you with a Briefe Relation and Refutation, of John Lilburnes Notorious Lyes, and for∣ged Calumnies, against the Parlia∣ment, and whole House of Commons in Gene∣rall, the Committee of Examination; Your selfe; some other Members of both Houses, your Bro∣ther Sir John Lenthall, and My selfe in speci∣all: Whereby the whole Kingdome may dis∣cerne his (and his confederates) Impudent Falsities, Forgeries, Lyes, groundlesse Slanders; and Your Ʋntainted Innocencies, triumphing gloriously over them. The truth of his Case, misreported by him, rightly stated; the Legality of Your Proceedings against, com∣mitment of him, demonstrated; his mistaken Law, refuted; and the seeds of Mutiny, of Sedition sowen among the Ignorant Ʋulgar, in

his seditious Printed Papers (scattered abroad by one Leaner and others, among the Kentish Malignants and the Male-contents in other parts) extirpated, to prevent all Popular, Insurrections against the Parliaments Sove∣raign Authority.
Your speciall Interest in the Subject mat∣ter of this Relation, hath (among other mo∣tives) induced me to select You for its Patron, in the Dedication, to whose Protection I com∣mend it, and Your selfe to Gods; desiring really to expresse my selfe upon all just Occasions,
