Dear and honoured friends!
HE is accounted a good Master of Rhetorick who can make much of a little: but I think him a better Friend of Truth (especially in controverted points) that makes a little of much, by summing up the substance of things disputed into heads, proving his Positives, and solving others Negatives, with short intelligible Arguments and Answers, which I have aymed at in this little Manuel. If I have done it well, I have my wish; if not, at least accept my endeavour. You were the first whose patience perused it, in a rough
 hand: I have now somewhat smooth'd it by the Presse, and chiefly in obedience to your commands: give me therefore leave to offer it, as a pledge of my affectionate re∣spects to both, under the shadow of your ingenious Patronage: and as you once were pleased to think well of it, being unpolished; so give it your protection, be∣ing perfected, and you abundantly shall crown his labours, who is ambitious to be stiled
Honoured Friends,
