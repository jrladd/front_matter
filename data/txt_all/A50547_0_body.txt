SIR,
IT was not in my Thoughts, that this Dis∣course should have gone farther than them for whom it was prepared; but since it was their desire as well as yours that it should I have submitted: Being preached at your Re∣quest, Decency requireth it should not come a∣broad but with your Name. Sir I have no reason to doubt, but that you are perswaded of what is here delivered of the Law of God;
and your Actings in this trying Time have shown, you have not so wild a Notion of Li∣berty, as to trust those high Pretenders, who would be making way to it by overturning the Laws of Men: But there are too many who have weak and dangerous Conceptions of these things. To rectifie such was the Design of this Sermon, wherein I have endeavored to repre∣sent Christianity, as Jotham did the Vine cheering God and Man, directing and com∣pleating our Behaviour for both Worlds. If any thing in it may prove useful, that they who outwardly profess the Faith, may sin∣cerely live according to the Rule of the Gospel; I shall be glad, that by my Compliance in pub∣lishing it, I have shown my self,
SIR,
