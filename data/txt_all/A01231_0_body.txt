IF Lawes by reason framed were, and grounded on the same;
If Logike also reason bee, and thereof had this name;
I see no reason, why that Law and Logike should not bee
The nearest and the dearest freends, and therfore best agree.
As for the fonde conceyt of such which neuer knew them both,
Better beleeue some mens bare worde, than their suspected oth.
I say no more then what I saw, I saw that which I sought,
I sought for Logike in our Law, and found it as I thought.
If all that I haue sought and found your Honor doe content,
(Let scribes and pety penmen talke) I thinck my time well spent,
And labour herein well imployd: Acceptance is my meede,
I craue no more, I haue no lesse, if you vouch safe to reede.
