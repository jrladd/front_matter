My Lord,
'TIS not upon the ac∣count of a common, and fashionable Cu∣stom, that makes De∣dicatory Epistles as ne∣cessary to Books, as Livery to Servants, that I have adventured to present to your Honour these ensuing Papers; neither was it my design in this enter∣prize, to publish to the World your extraordinary Merit, since 'tis already sufficiently known both at home and abroad, by the choice His Majesty made of your Lordship to manage his more important concerns in the Im∣perial Seat of Germany, where your
 Memory is still fresh, and your Repute beyond the reach of envy: Nor did I design by this small Present to take occasion, as I might easily have done, to publish the Illustrious, both Acti∣ons, and Sufferings of your great Fa∣ther, in performance of his Duty to his King and Country. My Chief inducement then to present this small Piece to your Honour, was your full knowledge of the matters it treats of: For I am fully perswaded there are but few in this Nation, if there be any, bet∣ter inform'd of the present State of Europe, and especially of Germany, of its true concerns, and interests: Your abode at Vienna, and your honourable employ there, gave you a fit opportu∣nity to dive into the depth of the most important affairs; and having added unto the Nobility of your Blood, that of the Mind, by an universal knowledge, and not ordinary Learning, I may say, My Lord, without flattery, which I hate, Cane petus et angue, above all things, that there is no Subject written of that you are wholly a Stran∣ger to. You shall meet then with no∣thing
 in these following Discourses you are not already acquainted with; for what I say of the Othoman Emperors, you have, (no doubt) Read elsewhere more than once; and as to my reflecti∣ons relating to the affairs of Germany, and other Princedoms of Europe, they cannot be unknown to your Honour, since you could not but see what so visibly flows from the premises sup∣pos'd in this Treatise; which as I com∣mit to your Noble Partronage and Pro∣tection, so I do freely submit to your impartial Verdict and Censure, as be∣ing willing to testify thereby to the World, with how much Esteem and Respect
