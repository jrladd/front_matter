AT what time (Right Honourable) the renowned Prince Philip of Ma∣cedon, was about to lay siege vnto the famous Cittie of Corinth, the Corinthians appalled with the fear of this sodaine newes, euery man fell to prepare himselfe readie to the defence of the Citie: here one scoured vp old ar∣mour, another carried morter and stones, to fill vp the breaches of the wall: others went to make a trench, others to the casting vp of a bulwarke: to conclude, euery man applied himselfe about some things, as need & time did require. Which diligence of the people, Diogenes marking well, hauing no∣thing wheron he might bestow his labour, girding his clothes to him, began to rowle his Tub, wherin he dwelt, vp and downe the Market place: and be∣ing asked of one of his acquaintance why he did so:

And I also (said he) do rowle my Tub, tht amongst so many workmen I alone might not be id. In like maner (right noble Lord) since the same hat hap∣ned to me now, as it was in Diogines age, that amogst so many multitudes of writers, which eueryday doo publish and set foorth new workes, I alone might not be idle, I haue thought good with Dioge∣nes to rowle my small Tub also: and because that, non omnibus contingit adire Corinthum, Of euery course wood Mercury is not made, neither is euerie mans Muse alike, to flie aloft: I haue bestowed my labor on the translatiō of this pleasant History, first writtē in Greek by Achilles Statius, which now I haue pre∣sumed to dedicate to your honor, being a delightful poeme, although in prose: which doth consist in the fiction, not in the meeter; although seeming full of prolixitie, yet with delight auoyding satietie, being a meane to beguile the time, and other exercises be∣ing past, to serue for recreation: wherefore I com∣mit this to your honourable protection: beseeching your honour fauourably to accept of this my small trauell in translating of this Author, whom if I haue worthily translated as he requires, I am assured your honour will well like of: knowing that if the grati∣ous beames of your fauour shine therin, no carping Momus can shadow it. Resting thus in hope of your Honours curtesie, I cease: wishing you a happie life, with increase of all honour and felicitie.
