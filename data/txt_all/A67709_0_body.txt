My Lord,
THe Dependance I have on your Lordship's Mannor of Lewisham, where this first Essay of my Labours had its
Birth, made me presume to offer It to your Lordships Patronage; which however I scarcely should have ventured to do, being so lit∣tle known to your Lordship, as I am, if your Condescention, and Affa∣bility, did not make as great a part of your Character, as any other of those Heroick Qualities, of which it is composed.
Indeed there is so near a Parallel betwixt your Lordship, and my Author, that I need not go farther for an Apology: For both of you, with all the advantages of Nature, Birth, and Education, entred early
upon high Trusts, & happily exe∣cuted them. Both great Lovers, and Asserters of Monarchy: For whilst Plato drew the Idaea of his Com∣mon-wealth, Xenophon compos'd the Model of a perfect Monarchy in his admirable Cyrus, which was in∣deed a dangerous undertaking for an Athenian, but cannot come up to the reputation of your Lordships Heroick Deportment in the House of Commons, when with undaunted Re∣solution, a manly sort of Eloquence, unanswerable Arguments, in short, with the same Spirit, with which you use to Fight, you maintained the cause of the Crown, and the Succes∣sion;
stem'd the Torrent of an impetu∣ous faction, slenderly seconded, yet unmoveable from your Princes Interests, in a Conjuncture when Loyalty was more Criminal than Trea∣son, and his Sacred Majesty in no less danger at Oxford, than his Fa∣ther of blessed Memory, when he was actually besieged there.
Both of you great Promoters of Learning, and Favourers of learned men, and (which rarely happens) joyn'd with it an exquisite skill in Martial Affairs.
Both of you concerned in and
successfully perform'd that part which is justly reckoned the most difficult Point of War; for as Xeno∣phon conducted the Grecian Army through the large Tracts of Asia, and made good their Retreat, so did your Lordship bring off the En∣glish from Africk, and as a good An∣gel delivered them, when they lay exposed as a cheap prey to the worst sort of Barbarians.
An Action which considered in all its Circumstances, the difficulty of the Work, the violence of the Season, a vigilant, powerful, and im∣placable Enemy, watching all his ad∣vantages
to fall upon you, was not only of greater Consequence to the Nation; but an instance too of Conduct, not inferior to the o∣ther.
Indeed it is a common Ob∣servation, that those very Per∣sons, who since endeavour to lessen that performance, when your Lordship with your accu∣stomed Obedience undertook the Expedition, gave it out for impos∣sible.
Not to mention that by the way, as it were, You almost ruined
Sally, that troublesome Nest of Py∣rats, the greatest Infesters of the English Navigation.
Nor to say any thing of the great Number of poor English Slaves which you most charitably redeemed, who every day they rise, are obliged to bless your Lordship for the Sight of their Native Countrey, and all the Com∣forts of their Lives.
This History relates the Down∣fal of three Famous Common-wealths, and (one would think) were a sufficient Argument to convince
even our Republicans, that that same accursed Fruit, which could thrive no better in its own Native Soyl, would much less prosper transplan∣ted hither, and engrafted on one of the most Ancient Monarchies in the World.
And as your Lordships Courage, and Conduct contributed very much to the reducing a Neighbouring Com∣mon-wealth to its just Bounds, (for the Dutch will never forget your Lordship, tho English men should) so was there no one more instru∣mental in crushing a rising Common∣wealth here at home: Your Lord∣ship
still broke, and prevented their Designs, put them clear out of the Road of 41, puzzled all their Ca∣bals, by securing the Magazines and Stores, which if you had not come in their way, they with great pro∣bability looked upon as their Own: So that those who at first could not comprehend the Reason of your Proceedings, upon the disco∣very of the late Horrid Conspiracy, cannot sufficiently admire, and ap∣plaud your Lordships Vigilance, and Conduct.
Indeed as no Subject would have been worse treated if their Trea∣sonable
Designs had took effect, so are all sorts of People sensible of it to that degree, that scarcely any one is now reckoned truly affectio∣nate to the Service of your Two Royal Masters, who has not a Par∣ticular Esteem, and Honour for your Lordship.
It is well for the Common In∣terest that you have not leasure to make out the Parallel, by writing an History, although your own Ex∣ploits would afford sufficient Matter for one. Your Lordships hours are employed about more necessa∣ry, and no less lasting Works than
my Authors. Not only the Pre∣sent Age, but late Posterity too, will be indebted to your Lordships in∣defatigable, and extensive Care, for their Peace, and Security, both at home, and abroad.
There is one happy disparity be∣twixt You, and my Author, that, as he lived in the Dregs of a Com∣mon-wealth, so does your Lordship serve the Wisest, and Bravest Princes in the World; who are no less Renowned for their Firmness to their Friends, and Royal Bounty in Rewarding them; Then Athens will be Infamous to all Ages for
her Ingratitude to those who did her the greatest Service.
That you may long live to do them More, and Greater Services, is now a Publick Wish; but in a more particular manner of
