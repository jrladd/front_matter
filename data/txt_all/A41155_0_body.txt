Right Honourable,
THe unworthy oppressed Au∣thor
hath not long since
groaned under the severe
censure of the late high
Commission for the ensu∣ing
speculations, which
now he adventures to present unto your Ho∣nour,
hoping for a candid acceptance, and in∣terpretation
of his poore endeavours for the
good of Zion. Had not the rising Sunne of
an auspicious Parliament dispelled those

clouds of oppression and tyrannie, that mena∣ced
a drowning both to me and them, they
had beene choaked in their embryo, and ne∣ver
enjoyed the happinesse they have now at∣tained
in your honourable aspect. Pardon
(most noble Lord) the enforced presumpti∣on
of the distressed Author, which implores
and hopes for your Honourable Patronage,
and humbly praying for the daily increase of
your Honours health and eternall happinesse,
remaines
