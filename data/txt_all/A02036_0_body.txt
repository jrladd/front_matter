GOOD MADAME:
MAY it please your Lady∣ship to accept this small treatise, of the right hea∣ring of the word. Small it is, not in respect of the sub∣iect; for to be a good hea∣rer is no lesse excellent a gift of grace, then to be a good speaker: but in respect of the forme, phrase, and manner of handling thereof, wherein I haue fashioned my selfe to the capa∣citie of vulgar ignorant people, euen such like as by Gods prouidence I haue heene called vn∣to, who are fitter for milke then strong meates.

Yet whatsoeuer it is, such it shall be, as your Ladiship shall accept it, and to speake ingeni∣ously without flatterie, which J euer hated, your amiable disposition to Vertue, & Piety, in your yong age, as I well obserued, when here∣tofore I liued at the house of the good Knight Sir Iohn Leuenthorp your father; and my often remembrance thereof vpon occasions, and now vpon this occasion also, as also the sin∣gular duty that I owe to your ancient, and tru∣ly honoured familie, and to you in speciall, haue moued me, and made me the bolder to of∣fer this vnworthy Present vnto you, desiring you to accept it only as a token of a thankfull minde, and sincere affection; which remaine euer disposed to the performance of any seruice wherein your Ladiship by me may be pleasu∣red.

From Botterwike in Holland, neere Boston in Lincoln∣shire. 1616.
