May it please your Grace.
THis undrest Play has been so little endebted to Poet and Painter, that it has wanted Beauty to invite Numbers, and Merit to secure Friends: yet with all its disadvanta∣ges, it has not mist of Honours; when it has appeared, so often favour'd by your Graces Presence, and somtimes by your Com∣mands; an encouragement so great, that your Grace little thinks what mischief you have brought upon your Self, by the Persecution you are like to suffer from the Addresses of so troublesome a Favou∣rite as Poetry; yet such a Favourite, whose Arrogance you cannot blame: For, as 'tis said of Poets, who are Born, not Made, 'tis so with their Patrons: Your Kindness is Hereditary, and you derive your Friendship to the Muses from your Noble Ancestry. The

Name of Newcastle warrants my Ambition; a Person of that Worth and Gallantry, that he has been an Atlas to Poetry; his Bounty to it admits of no Equal, and his Perfection in it, no Supe∣rior: Nor has he only been the greatest Protector of the Muses, but their greatest Subject too, witness those Immortal Trophies of Alle∣giance, his late memorable Services to an Exile King, and a de∣clining Crown; where his Unbyast Courage aim'd at no other re∣ward then the Glory of his Cause. And so like Caesar, who after his Conquests, wrote his own Commentaries, the Hand of a Newcastle acted, what the Hand of a Newcastle only was worthy to write. Thus have his adorable Qualities resembled the Arm'd Pallas amongst the Ancients; though in their infinite numbers of feigned Deities, they to every Attribute of a Divinity, nay almost to every Humane Art appropriated a particular God, yet they united Learning and Arms. Thus has this Illustrious Heroe character'd that Divinity on Earth, which they but fancied in Heaven. But your Graces Glory does not rest here; your Affinity is no less Conspicuous, than your Birth, being Allied to another equal Miracle of Loyalty, an Albemarle, differing from the former only in time and Fortune, That attended a Setting, and This Usher'd in a Rising Sun. Nor in this Circle of Honour does your Grace only share, but make a part; your own Virtues shine so worthy of the Sphear they move in, that all your additional Ornaments of Fame and Greatness, are not the Gift, but the Reward of Providence. And on that score Mariamne throws her self at your feet: Your smiles have made her a Captive, and your Vertues a Proselyte. But while so mean an Offering as a Play, begs your Acceptance, the more worthless, in that the hasty Representation of it did not give me time to put a finishing hand to it, the first Copy of it being given me by a Gentleman, to use and form as I pleas'd, I humbly implore, that, what the present wants may be supplyed by the Zeal and Obedience of
Madam,
