Right Reuerend Father:
I Write not this vnto your Lord∣ship by base flattery, to beg any thing of you; for I doe endea∣uour alwayes to support my meane estate by meditating on the Apostles lesson, in any state to be contented; and I know, that as we came naked into this world, so we shall all returne na∣ked hence againe: but I pre∣sume to affixe these few lines vnto these my poore labours, to assure the world of mine vnfained ioy to see your Lord∣ship placed in that seate of gouernment wherein you are, in a certaine hope, that (as Saint Paul said of Timothy) according to the prophesies that went afore of you; that is,
 the Propheticall expectation that all men conceiued of you; and the faire promises that your Religious and alwayes vpright carriage hath made vnto vs; your Lordship will be a great comfort, and a Diuine blessing vnto that whole Diocesse wherein you liue. I know it is the practise of ma∣ny, I dare not say of any Bishop, either basely to sell their spirituall promotions, or sinisterly to bestow them on their friends, their kinsmen and alliances; and yet I say not the Church of England doth imitate that painted Harlot of Babylon, nor that Ierusalem iustifieth Samaria; but as Demodocus said of the Milesians, they were no fooles, and yet they did the same things that fooles did; so I feare that we may say of many in the Church of England, we are no Pagans, no Popes, no Papists, no worldlings, no carnall men; and yet though I say not that any man doth ill, yet I doubt wee doe not all well, not much better then they vse to doe herein. I confesse the Apostle noteth it as a vice of the latter times, to be without naturall affection; but if gifts blinde the eyes of the wise, that they peruert iudge∣ment, I doubt not but this carnall loue of flesh and bloud will sometimes with Mydas, preferre Pan before Apollo: and this naturall affection to kinred, being vnworthiest, will not onely deiect the mindes of painefull men, and cause men rather to seeke to be allied to others, then to attaine vnto any worth in themselues; but it must also turne to the hurt and detriment of the whole Church of God, and doth apparantly shew such spirituall Patrons to be indeed car∣nally minded; for do not the Publicans and Sinners euen the same? and therefore though I wish all men to abound in loue and affection vnto their Kins-folkes, yet in this case, I would to God that all of vs,Deut. 33 8. wold imitate Leui, who saide vnto his father, and to his mother, I haue not seene him, nei∣ther did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his owne children, but obserued Gods word, and kept his couenant,
 that we would set God alwayes before our eyes;Neither doe I say this to deny that men should doe for their kinsfolke being worthy men, but that they should not doe this, neglecting others farre more worthy. and laying aside all sinister respects, would doe onely what should be most for Gods glory, for the encouragement of painfull Preachers, and for the best benefit vnto the people of God: for if Christ being lost by Mary and Ioseph could not bee found among his owne friends and kins-folkes, these men should take heed they finde him not among theirs. I could say more of this point, and yet not so much as Saint Bernard saith vnto Eugenius, of many other points like to this: but this will serue to be a witnesse against some at the dread∣full day, and perhaps to stirre vp as much rage against my selfe, as the Iewes had against Saint Stephen, for speaking this truth against them that vse such dealing against God: If it doth, I say as Saint Chrysostome said of the rage of that cruell Empresse: If they keepe me poore, I know Christ had not an house to put his head in; if they silence me and thrust me out of their Sinagogue; so was that poore man that confessed Christ, and the Apostles inioyned not to speake in the Name of Christ; if they cast me into prison, so was Ieremy, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and many more; If I be forced to flie my Countrey, I haue that beloued Iohn, and that Atlas-like Athanasius for presidents of the like vsage, or whatsoeuer else should be done vnto mee, I haue the holy Martyres for my fellow sufferers, and I will neuer count my life deere vnto me, so I may finish my course with ioy; but I will by Gods helpe, be euer ready, with all my heart, to suffer any thing for the Name of Iesus Christ, and for the least iot of his truth. But I doe much reioyce in that assured confidence which I haue, that your Lordship will herein, as well as in all other points of true piety, be an hea∣uenly shining light and president vnto all other circum∣stant and succeeding Bishops, and other Patrons whatso∣euer; and to that end my prayers shall euer continue for your Lordship.

And for you my most worthy friend, and neuer to be forgotten Benefactor, Sir Iohn Wynne, I must, because I may truely say of you with the Poet, Ego te intus & in cu∣te noui, I am so intimately and inwardly acquainted with your very heart & affections, most earnestly pray to God for your long continuance amongst vs: not onely because of your continuall loue and fauours vnto me and mine, but especially to be, as you haue beene hitherto, the chiefest pillar of ciuill gouernment, the best relieuer of our poore and nee∣dy, and the most apparant patterne of all good workes of pie∣ty and charity in all these parts wherein you liue: and you haue not lost your reward; for God hath blessed you and your Lady with many blessed children, all fearing God; I said enough, though I could truely say much more hereof; such a comfort, that not many men haue the like; and God renueth your yeares as the Eagles, and I hope yet will adde vnto your dayes, as he did vnto the dayes of Ezechias: and yet this is nothing; Quia merces tua apud Deum; in re∣spect of that great reward which you shall haue of God; be∣cause that by continuance in well doing, you shall be sure to haue glory, and honour, and immortality; and therefore most worthy Knight, as I beare witnesse of this truth which I haue seene and know of your Religious heart, fearing God, full of good, so I say vnto you, as Christ saith vnto the Church of Smyrna, Goe on in your course of godlinesse, and be faithfull vnto the death, and you shall haue the Crowne of life, when the Lord shall say vnto you, Euge serue bone, Well done thou good and faithfull seruant, enter thou into thy Masters ioy. Amen.
