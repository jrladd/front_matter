RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
I HAVE adventu∣red to commit vnto the publique view, vnder your Ho∣nour's name and pro∣tection, a second par∣cell of Dr Ed: Cha∣loners Sermons. I haue quickly named the Author and the Booke, that they may bee
my apology for presuming to your Lordships presence, (who otherwise should easily acknow∣ledge, that no shaft out of my owne quiver, nor any plume of mine, durst mount so high,) yet as I do ingeniously confesse, that there's nothing of mine owne, which I could account worthy to pre∣ferre mee to your Honour's notice: so do I verily beleeue, there's not any thing of this Authors composing so meane, which your Lordship will not value worthy your noble acceptation and patronage. The Reasons why I haue caus'd these Sermons to passe the presse, besides those mo∣tiues which induced our Dr to the publishing of the former (the good affections of some, his friends, earnestly desiring it:) first the Worth of the arguments, beeing severall choice peices of holy writ dexterously handled, and such as may well (if affection prejudice not my judge∣ment) proue serviceable to the Church and Com∣mon good: Next the loue and gratefull re∣spect, which I deseruedly beare to the memory of the Author deceased, joyntly excite mee thus to make him the more memorable; whilst I
endeavour that as by the blessing of God, his Name yet liues (and I wish his vertues too) in a Posthumus of his body: so both may surviue in these Postnati, the happie issue of his minde. VVhy, I haue dedicated, and now of∣fer them to your honour, I hope you will not interpret boldnes but duty; seeing not only those generall relations, which gaue you interest in the former, continue the same to these, but a speciall right hath now more intituled you to the whole, even Iustice; challenging the worke to him, to whom the Author hath devoted himselfe in all his publique endeavours. Your Lordships countenance to the booke shall se∣cure it against the Criticks rankest censure: as for the Author, he is now farther aboue their reach and venome, then the Publisher can be (though perhaps he is yet content to be) below their envy.
