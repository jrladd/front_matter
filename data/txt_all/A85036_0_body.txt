Most Sacred and Reverend Divines,
I Have but the thoughts of an Afternoone to
spread before you; for I Examined the same
Pace that I read, that if it were possible
a Truth might overtake an Errour, ere it goe too farre.
It is not a little Encouragement that I may sit like the
Prophetesse under the Palme tree, under such a
Shade as your selves, and what weakenesse soever
may appeare in these my Assertions: This ayring them
under your Patronage, will heale them. For so they

brought forth the sick into the streets, that at
least the shadow of Peter might touch some of
them. Thus have I suddenly set up my Candle for
others to Light their Torch at; and, I hope, you will
pardon me, if my Zeale to the Truth made me see Anoâˆ£thers
faults sooner then mine Owne,
