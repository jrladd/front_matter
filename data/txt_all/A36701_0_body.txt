SIR,
SEeing you are pleas'd to think fit that these Papers
should come into the publick, which were at first de∣sign'd
to live only in a Desk, or some private friends
hands; I humbly take the boldness to commit them
to the Security which your name and protection will
give them with the most knowing part of the world. There
are two things especially in which they stand in need of your
defence. One is, that they fall so infinitely below the full
and lofty Genius of that excellent Poet, who made this way
of writing free of our Nation: The other, that they are so
little proportion'd and equal to the renown of that Prince
on whom they were written. Such great Actions and Lives
deserving rather to be the Subjects of the Noblest Pens and

most Divine Phansies, than of such small beginners and
weak essayers in Poetry, as my self. Against these dange∣rous
Prejudices, there remains no other shield than the uni∣versal
Esteem and Authority, which your judgment and ap∣probation
carries with it. The right you have to them, Sir,
is not only upon the account of the Relation you had to this
great Person▪ nor of the General favour which all Arts re∣ceive
from you; but more peculiarly by reason of that obli∣gation
and zeal with which I am bound to dedicate my self to
your service. For, having been a long time the object of
your care and Indulgence towards the advantage of my studies
and fortune, having been moulded, (as it were) by your
own hands, and form'd under your Government; not to in∣title
you to any thing which my meaness produces, would not
only be injustice, but sacrilege. So that if there be any thing
here tolerably said, and which deserves Pardon, it is yours,
Sir, as well as he, who is
