May it please your Worship,
THE Ensuing Sheets being the Work of some spare Hours last Winter Mornings▪ redeemed; not from my Employment or particular Calling, but from my Rest and Sleep: I know not unto whom of Right, it doth more properly be∣long, than to your Worship; knowing that as you are my Governour, my Person is under your Protection, and my Manners fall under your Inspection.
I thought it meet therefore, that a Work of this Nature coming from me, should make its Acknowledgments to your Worship; and I do

hereby Humbly submit, both the Work and the Author of it, to your Worships Impar∣tial Judgment and Censure. And in doing this, I know not how to give your Worship flatte∣ring Titles, not only (though chiefly) be∣cause in so doing my Maker would be offended, but also, because I have Reason to believe, that your Worship is so Noble, and so truly Great; that 'tis as much below your Worship to re∣ceive them, as it is Breach of Duty in me to give them. Nor shall I with a Pretended shew of Humility, (the worst of all Pride) make any Apology, with a pretended Humble Peti∣tion for a Pardon for doing thus; not only be∣cause in so doing, I should be guilty of a Con∣tradiction, having already (as in Reason I ought) submitted both the Work and my Self, to your Worships Impartial Judgment and Cen∣sure.
And knowing also, such is the Gentleness and Candor of your Government, that Sins of Ignorance and Infirmity are discountenanc'd, and suppress'd with Admonition and Reproof; or elfe punish'd with such Gentle and Fatherly Cha∣stifement, as may serve only for an Effectual Ad∣monition to future Reformation. And I can as∣sure your Worship, (our Lord Jesus Christ who knoweth all things bearing me witness I lye not) that at first, and all the while I employ'd my Thoughts about the VVork it self, and of sub∣mitting the same to your Worships most solid and penetrating Judgment; I could not enter∣tain one Thought, of abusing Good Nature and a Gentle Governour at such an Unreasonable,

Wicked Rate, as sinning wilfully in Hope of a Pardon will amount unto.
I am very sensible, your Worship is called by the Good Providence of God, and the Voice of this City, to Much and Great Business in Pub∣lick Affairs, both in this City and for this City and Nation; among the Chief of our English Tribes, the Heads of their Fathers Houses, Men of Renown who have been and are to Assem∣ble together in Parliament; to Enquire and De∣termine what our English Israel ought to do: (That our Lord Jesus Christ may direct your Counsels, and bless your Resolves, is and ought to be the Prayer of every true English Chri∣stian.)
I shall not therefore presume, to detain your Worship with a Long Entry to a small Cottage; yet I think my Self obliged, to render to your Worship a Reason for my doing thus; and among others this is one, There is a Generation arisen up among us, who call themselves Wits, Free∣men (as they say) of the Common-wealth of Learn∣ing; but they prove themselves to be no other than a Select Number of Conceited Dunces, who are far enough from being Freemen of the Com∣mon-wealth of Sound Reason: And there is in∣deed, no such thing as the Common-wealth of Learning, that being a good Gift of God be∣stow'd but upon some; but Reason is given by the same Author of every Good and Perfect Gift, to Men as such; yet neither is this uni∣versal in common to all Men in any great mea∣sures thereof, witness our Pretenders thereunto.
And yet so vain are these Conceited Ones,

(and of all Fools they are the worst) that they not only say, they are Freemen of the Common-wealth of Wit and Learning; but they will needs make themselves (as Usurpers in all cases do) Masters and Magistrates of that which is Su∣periour to both; viz. The Common-wealth of Sound Reason.
Hence it comes to pass, that so many Name∣less Letters have been sent to our Noble Sena∣tors, with bold and presumptuous Exhortations to make Use of their Reason; as if Christia∣nity were an Enemy to Humanity: Or as if Faith destroyed Reason, charging all the Laity, as well the Nobility and Gentry; as the Com∣monality and more inferiour Mechanicks, to be no better than Biggots to the Clergy? And the Clergy no better, than Arbitrary Imposers of Idolatrous Doctrines.
Since therefore, these Bold Invaders on the Rights of Mankind in point of Reason, (as if they had ingross'd it all into their own Hands) are grown so Vain and Insolent, as to set Bounds not only to God's Word, but to God himself; they not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, form an Idea of God according to the Dictates of their own Foolish Brains: And what∣ever God saith of himself, yet he must be no other than what they say he is; and in all Pro∣bability the next Step will be, to say, he is not.
I therefore look'd for some Answers to those Unreasonable, as well as Unscriptural Pamphlets from our Reverend Divines; but finding these Pretenders had this Shift, to put off what the Clergy had said; And to amuse their Readers,

viz. That the Laity, and efpecially the more in∣feriour Sort, take those things upon Trust, and are led by the Nose by the Clergy.
To Convince therefore these Gainsayers, and to Honour our Lord Jesus Christ, and to let those Gentlemen know, that we Lay-men do see with our own Eyes; and that every true Christian (tho' the meanest of Mechanicks) is not taught by the Clergy only, but by the ex∣press Word of God; to Honour the Son even as we Honour the Father. For these Reasons, have I thus employed those Redeemed Hours, and for∣asmuch as your Worship hath an Undoubted Right, to judge both the Author and his Work; so I Humbly take Leave to cast both at your Worships Feet, and Subscribe my Self as I am,
