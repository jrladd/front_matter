Right Honourable.
YOur naturall propensitie and noble inclination to Learning and Religion, your good acceptance of this Authors little Ma∣nual of priuate Deuotions, lately presen∣ted to your Lordship, and my particu∣lar obligation, are the cause of this my dedication. My relation to the Author, brought his papers to my hands, and a

desire of the Churches benefit, bids me send them to the Presse. I thought fit to begin with this vpon the Lords Prayer, it being the Principle and Rudiment of Christian Religion: And albeit diuers learned Expositors haue trauelled very farre in discouerie of the hidden trea∣sure of this Celestiall Myne, yet such is the mysterious plenteousnesse of this compendium of Diuinity, (which is a contexture of God Almighty his owne making) as that it doth, and euer will, af∣foord continuall studie to the most la∣borious and curious searcher. This is such a prayer, as S. Augustine, Math. 6. speaketh of, Quae paucis verbis res multi∣plices comprehendit: Cuius mysteriorum profunditate Ingeniosorum prudentia stu∣pescit. It is a prayer dictated out of Gods owne mouth for our studie and imita∣tion: and therefore I shall neede no o∣ther motiue to your Lordships fauou∣rable

acceptation hereof. For the Au∣thor, your Lordship had some know∣ledge of him: he must be tam quam, that is, a right Minister of God: all his life must, as Saint Greg. super Eze. hom. 3. saith, sonare verbo & ardere desiderio. And that the Author was not vnlike: thus farre I may safely aduenture to the praise of his memory; that the Cler∣gy thought him a reuerend, lear∣ned, and orthodoxe Diuine; and that the Laytie found him alwaies painfully zealous in the Ministery, vpright and conscionable in his life and conuersati∣on: how he hath approued himselfe by these his labours, I doe in all humble∣nesse submit to your Lordships graue iudgement, and the iudicious Reader.
