GENTLEMEN,
THis Sermon which was first
Preach'd at the Desire of
Mt High Sheriff, being
now made Publick in comply∣ance
with His and Your unanimous Re∣quest,
Sues to You for Your acceptance, and

challengeth Your Protection: Not that the
Author is conscious to Himself of speaking
falsehood, but because He hath written too
Bold Truths for some tender Ears. The
Men of Moderation will accuse Him of
Intemperate Zeal; The downright Fana∣tick
of Popery. In Their abusive sense
of the words, He owns both parts of the
Accusation. By Intemperate Zeal, under∣standing
a Constant, Hearty, and unreserv'd
Affection for the KING and Govern∣ment;
and by Popery, a stedfast unfeigned
adhesion to the Church of England in all
Her Heights, and under the greatest Dis∣couragements,
which He thanks God He
always hath, and ever will be Guilty of.
He hath already tasted of Their civility in
several Scurrilous threatning Anonymous
Notes, for His Thanksgiving Sermon on
the 9th of September, which nevertheless
in spight of Envy and Obloquy shall stand
a lasting Record of a most Hellish Fana∣tick

Conspiracy: And when Authority shall
think fit, the 9th of September may be∣come
a day of Anniversary Thanksgiving,
as well as the 5th of November; since
the Deliverance of our Present Sovereign
from the Rye Assassination, must be ac∣knowledged
as Great and Miraculous as
that of His ROYAL Grandfather was
from the Gunpowder Treason. What en∣tertainment
this is like to meet with from
them, he knows not, neither doth he much
care, being well assur'd could he either
have digested the gainfull Art of Trim∣ming,
or Debauch'd himself into a Fana∣tick,
He might then have Commenc'd ei∣ther
a Moderate man or a Gifted brother;
And consequently thriv'n, as well as some of
them have done; but He chose rather to en∣joy
His Intemperate Zeal (knowing it
hath been serviceable to the Publick) in
an humble contented State; than Rise to
great Preferments with a Guilty Con∣science,

or Shipwrack'd Reputation; yet
He wishes this may prove as successfull
as the other did; That having undecei∣ved
very many, who were misled in the
simplicity of their Hearts; and He hath
received their Gratefull acknowledgements,
the best Reward He could expect. But
Gentlemen, I must not turn a Dedication
into a Preface, and represent my own case,
when I should be reciting Your Merits, which
are so great and well known, that His
MAJESTY takes Notice of You in a
particular manner; and therefore 'twould
be a diminution of Your worth, for me to
panegyrize on Your constant unwearied en∣deavours
for the Service of your KING
and Country. Happy KING! in such
Subjects, whom Loyalty has united into
an Entire Friendship; and Conformity to
the Church, made unanimous: which I
could not but take notice of then, and now
Publish to the World for an Example to

others. Whatever be the Fate of this
Sermon, I can willingly undergo it, since
'twas the occasion of bringing Me into the
knowledge of so many Loyal Gentlemen,
for whom I shall always preserve an un∣feigned
Esteem and Veneration, and ac∣count
it an Honour to subscribe My self,
GENTLEMEN,
