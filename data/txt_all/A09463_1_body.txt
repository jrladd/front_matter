RIGHT Honorable,Mat. 3. as Iohn the Baptist was in one desert, so our
Sauiour Christ he was in an other:Mat. 4. 1. but as these two differed in their
being in the world: so did they not accord in their being in the
wildernesse. Iohn was with some men, Christ with none; Iohn was
with wilde men, Christ with wild beasts; Iohn was preaching, Christ
praying; Iohn was baptizing, Christ fighting; Iohn was feeding,
Christ fasting; Iohn was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Christ
did encounter with the Prince of those Diuels. From Iohn prea∣ching
in the desert, learne wee diligence in our callings: from
Christ tempted in the desert, see we troubles at our calling:Psa. 34. 19. Many are the troubles of the
righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of all.
If it please you to giue these after-lines the reading, you shall see set downe that monomachie
or single combat, which was hand to hand betwixt Christ and the Diuell. And as for Christ
Iesus, you shall see him fasting, fighting, conquering. Fasting and an hungry, to shew he was
man: fighting and encountring, to shew he was Messiah; and conquering and triumphing, to
shew he was God. And as for the diuell, you shall see him obiecting, answering, flying. Obie∣cting,
thatMat. 4. 3. Christ might despaire;Mat. 4. 6. answering, that he might presume; andMat. 4. 11. flying, when he
could not ouercome.
In Christs temptations, we see the estate of the1. Pe. 2. 21. Church; in Satans assault, we see his ma∣lice
to the1. Pet. 5. 8. Church, Is Christ tempted? think it not strange if we fall intoIoh. 15. 20 temptations. For
the griefe of the head, is the griefe of the1. Cor. 12. 26. members: and the temptations of Christ, shew the
temptations ofIoh. 15. 20. Christians. It is true of Christ, thatAct. 14. 21 by many tribulations he did enter into
the kingdome of God: thatHeb. 2. 10 our High Priest was consecrated by afflictions, that so he must suf∣fer
and enter into hisLuk. 24. 26 glory.
He is no sooner borne into the world, but he isMat. 2. 14. hunted by Herod; baptized at Iordan,Mat. 3. 16. 4. 1. but
Satan sets on him; a Preacher for repentance, but theIoh. 7. 1. Scribes proscribe him; toLuk. 11. 15. worke mi∣racles,
but the Pharises slander him. He is no sooner to suffer, butIoh. 12. 27. the Diuell assaults him;
apprehended, but theIoh. 18. 28 Iewes deliuer him; deliuered, butLuk. 23. 11. Herod derides him; derided, but
Luk. 23. 24.Pilat condemnes him; condemned, but the souldiersMat. 27. 27. abuse him. Is he on the crosse? the
Mat. 27. 39.people will not pity him: is he risen? the high Priests willMat. 28. 15. belie him. In a word, is he vpon
earth? he is tempted in hisLuk. 11. 16. person; is he in heauen? he isAct. 9. 4. tempted in his members. Thus
the life of Christ was a warfare vpon earth, and the life of Christians must be a warfare vpon
earth. We liue heere in a sea of troubles: the sea is the world, the waues are calamities, the
Church is the ship, the anker is hope, the sailes are loue, the Saints are passengers, the hauen
is heauen, and Christ is our Pilot. When the sea can continue without waues, the shippe with∣out
tossings, and passengers not be sicke vpon the water, then shall the Church of God be with∣out
trials. We begin this voiage so soone as we are borne, and we must saile on till our dying
daie.
We doe reade in Gods word of many kinds of temptations: God, Satan, Man, the World,
and the Flesh, are saide to tempt. God tempteth man to trie his obedience, Satan tempteth
man to make him disobedient: man doe tempt men to trie what is in them: and man tempteth
God to trie what is in him. The world is a temper, to keepe man from God: and the flesh is a

tempter, to bring man to the Diuell: So God tempted AbrahamGen 22. 1. in the offering of his son:
SatanIob. 1. 18. tempted Iob in the losse of his goods: a1. Kng. 10. 1. Queene tempted Salomon in trying his wise∣dome:
menEx. 17. 3. tempted God by distrust in the desert: the world tempted Domas,1. Tim. 4. 10. when he
forsooke the Apostles: and the flesh tempted Dauid,2. Sa. 11. 4. when he fell by adultery. Doth God
tempt vs? take heed of hypocrisie: doth Satan tempt vs? take heed of his subtiltie: doth man
tempt man? take heed of dissembling: doth man tempt God? take heed of inquiring: doth the
world tempt man? take heed of apostasie: doth the flesh tempt man? take heed of carnalitie.
But dowe so? are we warie of these tempers? No, we are not, and therefore we fall. We fall
on the right hand, by temptations in prosperitie, and we fall on the left, by temptations in ad∣uersitie.
Of the one it may be said, it hath slaine1. Sa. 18. thousands: of the other, that it hath slaine
ten thousands.
When we come and see cities dispeopled, houses defaced, and wals pulled downe, we say, the
souldier hath beene there: and when we see pride in the rich, discontent in the poore, and sinne
in all, we may iustly say, the Tempter hath beene there.
Now of all other temptations, it pleaseth God to suffer his church to be tempted with afflicti∣ons.
It is neuer free either from the sword of Ishmael; which isGen. 21. 9. a reuiling tongue: or the
sword of Esau, aGen. 27. 41. persecuting hand. Neither was there yet euer Christian man found, who had
not his part in the cup of affliction. We must drinke of theMat. 20. 23. same cup our master did:Mat. 10. 24. the di∣sciple
is not aboue his master.
The reasons why God doth visit vs thus with afflictions, are: 1. To humble vs. 2. To weane
vs. 3. To winnow vs. 4. To preuent vs. 5.Reasons why God doth afflict his children. To teach vs. 6. To enlighten vs. 7. To honour vs. 8.
To cure vs. 9. To crowne vs. 10. To comfort vs. 11. To protect vs. 12. To adopt vs. And last
of all, to teach and comfort others. ToEc. 3. 10. humble vs, that we be not proud:Psal. 119. 67. to weane vs, that
we loue not his world:Luk. 22. 31. to winnow vs, that we be not chaffe:Psal. 119. 71. to preuent vs, that we do not
sinne:Psal. 39 9 40. 1. to teach vs, that we be patient in aduersity: toGe. 42. 21. enlighten vs, that we see our errors: to
Lam. 5. 11.honor vs, that our faith may be manifest: to cure vs, that weDeu. 32. 15. surfet not of securitie: to
2. Tim. 4. 7.crowne vs, that we may liue eternally: toIoh. 6. 33. comfort vs, that he may send his spirit: toAct. 12. 7. pro∣tect
vs, that he may guide vs by his Angels: toHe. 12. 7. adopt vs, that we may be his sonnes:2. Pet. 2. 5. and
to teach others, that they seeing how sin is punished in vs, they may take heed it be not found in
them: that they2. Cor. 1. 6. seeing our comforts in troubles, may not be discouraged in the like trials.
Thus a Christian mans diet is more sowre then sweet: his physicke is more alcës then hony:
his life is more a pilgrimage then a progresse: and his death is more despised then honoured.
This if men would thinke of before, afflictions would be as welcome to the soule of man, asRuth. 2. 8. affli∣cted
Ruth was to the field of Boaz. But because we looke not for them before they come, thinke
not on Gods doing when they are come, and doe desire to be happie both heere and hereafter;
therefore we can away with the name of Naomi, but in no case would we be calledRuth. 1. 20. Mara.
WeIoh. 1. 5. see the sea, not the whale: theExod. 14. 11. Egyptian, not the saluation: theDan. 6. 16. 22. Lious mouth, not
him that stoppeth the Lions mouth. If we could see God in our troubles, as2. King. 6. 16. Elisha did in his,
then would we say: There are more with vs, then there are against vs. But because we doe
not, therefore at euery assault of the Assyrians, we say, as the seruant to2 King. 6. 15. Elishah did: Alas
master, what shall we doe? and with the disciples: Carest thou not Master that we perish? Yet
it is good for vs to suffer affliction:Iam. 1. 12. Ioh. 5. 17. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he
is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him.
It isPro. 3. 11. commanded by God,Mat. 4. 2. practised by Christ,2. Tim. 3. 12. yeelded to by the Saints,Psal. 119. 71. assigned by Gods
prouidence, and good for vs ech way. We are GodsPs. l. 1. 4. trees, we shall groe better by pruning: Gods
pomander, smell better by rubbing: Gods spice, he more profitable by bruising: and Gods con∣duits,
we are the better by running. Let vs suffer afflictions, they are2. Cor. 4. 17. momentany in respect of
time:Phil. 1. 29. fauors, if we respect Gods loue, and a meanes to bring vs to the kingdome of God. If
they did consume vs, we might wish them an end: but they doe purge vs, let vs be content. They
Act. 14. 21.are Gods fan, we are Gods wheat: they are Gods boulter, we are Gods meale: they are Gods
Pet. 1. 5.flame, we are Gods bush: they are GodsGe. 22. 9. cords, we are Gods sacrifice: they are Gods fornace,
we are Gods gold. The wheat will not be good without the fan, nor the meale without the boulter,
nor the bush without the flame, nor the sacrifice without the cords, nor the gold without the for∣nace:
they are trials, not punishments, if we be sonnes: punishments, not trials, if we be slaues.

Let vs then beare them, theyPsal. 37. 37. will haue an end: ioyPs. 126. 5. will follow: theyIsa. 38. 10. shew vs our weekenesse:
theyHos. 5. 15. moue vs to pray: theyLuke. 24. 26. shew we are in the path way to heauen: andEcc. 1. 2. make vs contemne
this present world. By them we2. Sam. 24. 17. learne to repent vs of sinne past,Ge. 39. 9. to take heed of sinne pre∣sent,
and to foresee sinne to come. By them weAct. 2. 2. receiue Gods spirit:Phi. 3. 10. are like to Christ: are ac∣quainted
Da. 3. 17.with Godspower: haueExod. 15. 1. ioy in deliuerance: know benefit of prosterity: made more
hardy to suffer: and1. Pet. 1. haue cause to practise many excellent vertues. They cause vs (as one
saith) to seeke out Gods promise: the promise to seeke faith: faith to seeke praier: and praier to
finde God.Mat. 7. 7. Seeke, and yee shall finde:Iob. 21. 27. call, and he will answer:Hab. 2. 3. waite, and he will come. I
am to write an Epistle, I must not be long. IobsIob. 2. messengers came not so fast on him: but Iobs
afflictions may come as fast vpon vs. Hath Dauid slain1. Sam. 17. 37. a Beare? he shall encounter with a Li∣on:
hath he killed a Lion?1. Sa. 18. 27. he must fight with Goliah: hath he subdued Goliah? he must
make a rode vpon the Philistims: are the Philistims conquered?1. Sa. 21. Saul wil assault him. Re∣member
Dauids troubles, and feresee what may be our troubles. The more righteous we are,
the more manifold are our troubles: and he better we are, the better we may indure them.
But as our troubles are many, so are our deliuerances many God will deliuer vs out of all. He
that deliueredGen. 7. Noah from the floud,Gen. 19. Lot from Sodome,Gen. 33. Iacob from Esau,Gen. 41. 14. Ioseph from
Potiphar,Exod. 9. Moses from Pharaoh,Exod. 12. Israel from Egypt,1. Sa. 19. Dauid from Saul,1. King. 21 Eliah from A∣chab,
2. King. 6.Elisha from the Syrians,2. King. 5. Naaman from his leprosie,Isa. 38. Hezechiah from the plague,
Dan. 3.the three children from the fire,Dan. 6. Saint An∣drewes in Nor∣wich. Daniel from the Lions,Mat. 6. Ioseph from Herod, the Apostles
Act. 5.from the Iewes,Mat. 4. and Christ from the Diuell: he, euen he will either deliuer vs from trou∣ble,
or comfort vs in trouble, or mitigate troubles when they come vpon vs.
He,Ro. 4. 21. he hath promised to doe it, and he that hath promised, is able to do it. And this he
doth sometimes by no meanes, sometimes by small meanes, sometimes by ordinary meanes, some∣times
by extraordinarie, sometimes contrarie to all meanes. By noIoh. 5. 9. meanes be cured a creeple
at Bethesda: byIoh. 6. 12. small meanes he fed fiue thousand in the desert: byMat. 4. 7. ordinary meanes he was
brought from the pinnacle:Mat. 4. 11. by meanes extraordinary he was prouided for in hunger: and
contrarie to all meanes were theDan. 5. three children preserued in the fornace of fire.
I haue good cause to thinke of Gods gracious deliuerance, being my selfe deliuered from a
great trouble. Since the time I was vnkindly dismissed from my poore charge, where I would
haue continued, if malice had not hindred me, I haue liued in an end of this City: dangerously
in respect of the sicknesse; poorely in regard of maintenance; and painfully, in respect of my mi∣nisterie:
yet till this time hath the Lord deliuered me: and as Paul said,2. Tim. 1. 18. he will deliuer me, if
that he see it be best for me.
Let man therefore1. Sam. 309. comfort himselfe in the Lord:Hos. 6. 2. after two daies he will reuiue vs, and
the third day he will raise vs vp againe:Psal. 30. 5. Heauiensse may endure for a night, but ioy will come
in the morning.Psal. 58. 11. Doubtlesse there is a reward for the righteous: verily,Mca. 7. 8. God retaineth not his
wrath for euer. Could he ouercome the world, and can he not ouercome many troubles in the
world? Yea, let one plague follow another, as one quaile sings to another: yet as theAct. 28. 3. viper lea∣ped
on Paules hand, and forthwith leaped off againe, so one trouble shall leape vpon the righte∣ous,
and anon leap off againe:Ps. 37. 24. though he fall, he shall rise againe, the righteous shall not be for∣saken
for euer.
if he hath deliuered vs from the guilt of our sinnes, he will deliuer vs from the punishment of
our sinnes. Let vs then therefore be patient in trouble, constant in hope, rooted in loue: let vs
waite and he will come, call and he will heare, beleeue and he will performe, repent vs of our euill
committed against him, and he will repent of his euils intended against vs. He is ouer vs by his
prouidence, about vs by his Angels, in vs by his spirit, with vs by his word, vnder vs by his
power, and vpon vs by his Sonne. In him is our helpe, from him is our comfort, by him is our
victory, and for him is our trouble.Psal. 25. In thee haue I trusted, saith a king:Iob. 5. who euer was con∣founded
that trusted in the Lord▪ said a friend? and as Elkanah was to1. Sam. 1. 8. Hannah in stead of ma∣ny
sons, so God is to his in stead of many comforters. Of other comforters, we may say as Iob did
of his frinds:Iob. 16. 2. Silly comforters are you all. They will leaue vs, as mice doe a ruinous house▪ but
the Lord (likeRuth. 1. 16. Ruthe to Naomi) will neuer leaue vs, nor forsake vs, Especially in the houre
of death,Ecc. 41. 1. which is in remembrance bitter to great men: in that houre of death he will be with
vs, and command hisLuk. 16. 26. Angels to take charge of our soules, theIsa. 37. 2. earth to be as a bed for our

bodies: that so the oneLuk. 23. may goe into glory, the other reserued in hope of like glorie,Phil. 3. 20. and be
made one day like vnto the glorious body of Christ Iesus. Thus, right Honorable, you haue seene
the righteous in affliction; asPl. 137. Israel was in Babylon: and that the Lord likeZac. 4. 6. Zorobabel is
ready to deliuer them. Though in troubles Christs seemes as in theMat. 8. 24. ship to sleepe, yet in deli∣uerance
he awakes as a man out of sleepe, and as a Giant refreshed with wine. He will rebuke
the waues and winds of troubles and persecution, and they shall flie before him as Sysera did be∣foreIud. 17. 4.
Debora, and the1. Sam. 14. Philistims before Ionathan and his seruant. And as Christ asking the
woman of her accuser she answered, There was none: so in the end aske a Christian of his trou∣bles,
and he will say, There are none.Ioh. 8. He is a buckler for our left hand, and a sword in our right:
he is an helmet on our head, and harnesse for our body. We shall looke vpon troubles, asExo. 14. Israel
did on the Egyptians, as the1. Sam. 17. 52. Iewes did on Goliah, and as the Grecians did on Hector, to tri∣umph
ouer them: and as the Angell said to Ioseph.Mat. 2. 20. They are dead that sought the childs life;
so the Spirit shall say to the afflicted, They are dead that did seek your life. A day of deliuerance,
a yeere of Iubile will come, and thenGen. 41. Ioseph shall be out of prison,Gen. 31. Iacob out of seruitude, and
Iob. 41. 12.Iob shall lie no more in the dust of the earth:1 Thes. 4. 18. Let vs comfort our selues with these words.
I haue exceeded an Epistle, especially to such a small bocke. If the wals seeme too great for
this city; abundans cautela non no cet. It is vsuall for students not onely to present their
owne labours, but also other mens to great personages, especially such Workes wherein they
haue beene either Translators or ouerseers. It were infinit to instance this point. I am bolde
to doe the like to your Honour at this time. This Copie it was brought vnto my hand, I haue
conferred it with another, I haue persued it at the Presse, I heard diuers of the Sermons, I
haue added nothing of mine owne: and I desire, that of thoseIoh. 22. many baskets full of most deli∣cate
diet, which this worthy man hath now left behind him, there may not so much as any one be
lost. If any such come vnto my hand, surely they shall not be lost. By his life had I much com∣fort,
and I will seeke to honour him after he is dead. I was twenty yeeres acquainted with him:
I at his request made the first fruits of his labours to speake English.The Golden chaine. And now I am bold to pre∣sent
this his posthume to your patronage.The Earle of Bedford. Your honorable Nephew, his vertuous Lady, your
worthy sister, haue heeretofore accepted the labours of this man. If it shall please your good Ho∣nor
to do the like,The Countesse of Bedford. this Preface of mine shall remaine as a perpetuall testimony of my duty to you:
and the booke following as fully armed against all such aduersaries as shall speake against it.
The God of heauen,The Countesse of Cumberland. who hath made you honorable in your most honorable Progenitors, make
you thrice honorable in your future successors: that the memoriall of the righteous may be euer∣lasting,Pro. 10. 7.
