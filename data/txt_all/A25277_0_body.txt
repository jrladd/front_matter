Heavy Thrashers of Prose, and Tormentors of Rhime.
You Play-Wights and Authors, with all their Attendance,
The Locusts of Egypt were a civiller Vengeance.

To the Makers of Devils, and Sermons, and Monsters;
Than whom there's no Vulture discover can further,
By Instinct, the Approach of Dire Battle and Murder.

From great Mr. Bays down to little Mr. D—y.

Though I hope, Mr. Author, to ben't far behind you:
And 'twere best that your Back you'd prepare for a humming,
The Drawer most humbly pre—He would have said Presents, but the Bell ringing on the sudden, unluckily stopp'd him in the middle of the Word.

Coming, Sir, Coming!
