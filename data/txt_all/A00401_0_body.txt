TO recognize (sir) in multitude of wordes, how much charged I stand vnto your boun¦tie, were to your wise∣dome, I knowe, but friuolous, who better respecteth the inward seruice intended of any one (wherof I hum∣bly beseech you on my part to stand assured) than an outward behauior, the validitie whereof manie wayes may be doubted. Yet neuerthelesse, in that the thoughts of men are onlie in word or action to be desciphered, let it, I beseech you, stand with your good fauour, that I may by this litle mite of my friendes labours confesse my self bound vnto you: and for the residue, when it shal seeme good vn∣to you to commaund mee, I will not

haue life or abilitie that shall not bee yours, in all it may please you to vse me. Thus much to haue deliuered, may, for the present, satisfie my mind but thus much to haue perfourmed, would content my soule, for that in al actions of the body inwardly to be effected, the minde is pleased with speach, and the heart only is repleni∣shed by the dooing. Much more to haue protested, were no more than sufficient, though more than where∣with your modestie will be pleased, for which, I remaine in heart more than in abilitie to answere the same: humbly submitting my poor seruice to the censure thereof, and recom∣mending you vnto the protection of the Almightie, and to the happy possessing of your hearts best content.
