MY LORD,
AS well the consideration of your Lordships most eminent dignity in the Church, as those evident and publick testimonies of your pious affection to it, which you have not ceased at those times to demonstrate, when the black clouds of Malignity had overspread it; hath emboldened me to present this Treatise to your Patronage. Nor can I doubt that your Lordship, who hath been so high a Vindicator of the Churches honour, will deny to Cherish with the beames of affection, any thing which offers at the defence of Devotion and Piety. Blessed be God, the Sun of the Gospel hath again appea∣red, and the truth of Religion in part dispell'd, those clouds which so lately hid it in obscurity: how great an Instrument your Lordship hath been in the promotion of this great and happy work, is fitter to be left to the judgment of the world, then for me to speak or your Lordship to hear. But that
there are still some mists in this our Hemisphere, whose foggy influence doth blind wages of truth, is so well known and so much lamented by your Lordship that I dare be bold to assure my self, that you will look upon nothing as needless or unneces∣sary which indevours to make plain the Catholick paths. The thing it self was long since delivered in Latin, by a worthy and pious Divine in order to the satisfaction of a learned Auditory; under your Patronage and Protection my Lord, it offers it self in English for the vulgars devotion and reasonable service. Let your Lordship therefore be gratiously pleased, to excuse the boldness of this address, and to put it on the score of our holy Mo∣ther the Church, who hath already been so signally obliged by your endevours; and grant that he who continually prays both for Her & Your Lordships prosperity, may confidently assume the boldness to subscribe himself
(My Lord)
