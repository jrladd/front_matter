DEDICATED
To the illustrous Lampe of true VVorth, the noble, Ingenious,
judicious, and vnderstanding Gentleman, Sir IAMES
MVRAY Knight.
VNto the prospect of your Wise∣domes eyes,
I Consecrate these Epithalamies.
Not that I thinke them worthy of your view,
But for in Loue my thoughts are bound to you:
I doe confesse my selfe vnworthy farre
To write, in such high canses as these are,
Which, Homer, Virgil, nor the fluent Tully,
In sitting tearmes could scarce expresse them fully:
But since the Muses did their bounties show,
And on me did poore Poësie bestow;
I hold it best to play the thankefull man,
To spend their guifts the best wayes that I can,
And not like pedling Bastards of the Muses,
That like to Lawyers, liue on Times abuses.
Thus vnto you I giue it as it is,
Desiring pardon where there's oughts amisse.
