GEntlemen and Goodsellowes, and to loyne you both in one, men and school-fellowes: I have as you see adven∣tured to she, although both fitted with the feathers of another, and lying but a lowe pitch, for want of winges. If I shall see me to any of you too forward, I craue ls pardon, it is my first sault, I meant no urt: If any man will charge me of defects, I will confesse my wants, and submit my selfe nto any reasonable censure. Howbeit I look for no hard measure from any, frequenting these exercises, either in the schoole or a∣broad, masmuch as they are for the most parte tame beastes that belong to this folde: what the wilde and sauage forte can or will doo I feare not, I can appeale from them, as in this case, no competent Iudges. I haue after my manner dealt plainely with the matter, and I pray you take it as it is, masmuch as howsoeuer it de serueth, I can set it out no better, For as one saith.
They that are learned and haue the gift,
may make of matters what they will,
But he that hath none other shift,
must goe the plaine way to the mill.
