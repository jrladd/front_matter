May it please your Grace,
HAving been called forth to labour in the Lord's Vineyard, and that under the jurisdiction of Your Most Reverend Paternity: It hath pleased God to aid me with His gracious assistance, in the open∣ing of one of the most curious Mysteries, that in His Holy book is revealed from Heaven. In the manage of this employment, I have not loaded the Roman Church with the guilt of so many Monsters, Beasts, and Evil Members, as others who have writ∣ten before me have done; but rather care∣fully have endeavoured to lay upon every Horse His own burthen; and so to carry my candle, as to give light unto no mans evil Deeds, any farther then as it receives light from God's Holy word. You have lived (My Lord) to have been an ocular witness
 of Those Two famous branches of God's Olive-trees, in these papers mentioned, which were cut down, and yet have sprouted and put forth again. And now at last, it hath pleased God to graft Your self also in∣to the same Holy Tree, and from the leaves and flowers of your bough, to drop Oyl into His sacred Candlestick. You have stood in the Gap in a time of need; and have had the Honour together with my Right Reve∣rend Dioecesan and others, to make the first stop against the inundations of encroaching Popery. And under Your pressures, (God be praised) the light of that holy Oyl which fell from Your boughs, hath shon so much the brighter. The good God of His bles∣sing make Your serene and pious paths to shine through the thickest mists of obscurity, and guide Your Thoughts and Councils in all difficulties for the best, unto His Glory, and the good of His holy Church of Eng∣land. So most heartily prays My good Lord,

Sept. the 12th. 1688.
