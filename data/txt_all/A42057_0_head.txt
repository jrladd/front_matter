To the little Flock of Christ, over whom the Holy Ghost hath made me Overseer. The Father of Mercies, and God of all Grace, who hath called you to his Eternal Glory by Christ Jesus, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, set∣tle you, and make known to you that Mystery, which from the begin∣ning of the World hath been hid in God, who created all by Jesus Christ.
