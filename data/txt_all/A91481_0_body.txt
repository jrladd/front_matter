BƲt that I know Your Lord-ship's unpara∣lel'd Goodnesse, which can easily pardon the Crimes my ambition throws  me on, I should not have presumed (after those many deserved Tri∣umphs your Honour hath met abroad, and those lowder accla∣mations that crown your return) to disturbe your Lordship by so mean a present.
But the Author having had in his life time the honour of being well known, and obliged to your Lordship for many very noble fa∣vours, I could not, without being injurious to the Dead, (whose  Gratitude commands it) and the Dignity of your own merit (which ennobles any object it lights on) have presented this Tribute to any other person then your Selfe.
And indeed (my Lord) be∣sides the obligations of the Au∣thor, this little Volume belongs to none more properly then Your Selfe, who next his Ma∣jesty are one of the most illu∣strious Patterns of afflicted  Vertue the world can boast of, having tasted of all those unex∣pected changes Greatnesse is lyable to, without any in your selfe, no stormes being able to
shipwrack your undaunted Loyalty, shake that Heroick Constancy you are the happy Master of, or eclipse the Pie∣ty of your soule.
So that after all those won∣ders you have seen
abroad, you are become a Greater one your  Selfe, having contracted all the rarities of other places into your selfe, which proclaime you (though a Subject) greater then other Princes.
When I cast my eye on those Comforts which long
bleeding Ireland did tast of under your Conduct, how many
Orphans teares have been dried up, and widowes Groanes stopt by your bounty; how with Moses you stood in the gap, and opposed  two high destructive
factions, how that afflicted Church owes that little life it as yet hath, to your memory, and which it struggles to preserve in hopes of your noble protection.
When I consider how many of the Reverend and pious
Cler∣gy of that nation (stript of all by an enraged enemy) had fain∣ted to death, unlesse held up by your Arme, and their drooping spirits reviv'd by your Munifi∣cence,  and by the Pious, and un∣paralelld Charity of your most honourable, and most Incompa∣rable Lady.
When I consider how nobly you ever owned both the Cal∣lings, and Persons of the Mi∣nisters in their lowest Condition, and undauntedly protected both against all Contempt.
When I reflect on those high Qualities which render you
deserving the highest Fa∣vour  and employment of your Prince, when I cast my eye on these and those
many more excellencies you triumph in, I must justly proclaime that Church happie, which shrouds its selfe under so
noble a wing, and that Kingdome to have out-done it selfe, which pro∣duceth so Loyall a Subject.
To flatter Your Eminent Ver∣tues (my Lord) were to wrong them, and to think I intended  to do so, were to wrong me; I shall not much studie for an Apolo∣gy, because the world will not only pardon, but applaud this Choice; nor can there be any better way of reviving the Ac∣knowledgments of the Dead, whose memory cannot have a Greater honour than your Lordship's owning of his la∣bours, nor my selfe a higher, then of being my Father's succes∣sour in part of your Honour's esteeme, and of being ad∣mitted  into the number of
Jesus Colledge, OXON.
