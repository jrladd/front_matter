WHen once I had yeelded (right honorable) to the often and earneste request of sundry men, for the publish∣ing of certeine Lectures which (as they said) not without some fruite they had heard me reade, I was soone resolued within my selfe of one, to whome I might present the first fruites of this my labour. For the well accep∣ting of that which first I did speake before your honour, put me in assured hope to finde an indifferent eare for this, whiche with more deliberation I should commit to writing and the manifolde benefites which I haue receiued, constreined me to lay holde of any opportunitie offered, whereby I might lee some remembraunce of my thankefulnesse and dutie toward a∣ny of that honourable house of Warwick, to the which I am (in the Lord) so many wayes indebted. Wherof I haue in few wordes to say thus much, that I thinke there is great occasion offered of thankefulnesse vnto the Lord, who would that so many benefites and so much comforte should come to me from thence, that he hath offered me also this opportunitie, to leaue behinde me a thankefull memorie thereof, that there might be some remembraunce continued of that thing, that hath in it greate deseruing why it shuld not be soone forgotten. And to the Christian reader whosoeuer I say, that I am not ignorant into what danger I haue offered my selfe, attempting to write of that matter wherein so many and godly men with so greate fruite and commendation haue trauayled before me for to add any thing vnto them, or to differ any whit from them, will bee charged of some with noueltie, or secret reprehension of their trauayles, and to tread in the same steps with others that haue

gone before, shal not be able to auoide the blame of needlesse la∣bour, and trauel to no purpose. I am therefore to require of all men that iudgement may not proceede against me, before I shal be admitted to speake for my selfe, and that with indifferencie it may be heard what can be said, why no suche sentence ought by any right to passe against me or any other in the like attēpt. And for the former charge (of adding any thing to the labours of so godly men) if those who haue gone before vs hauing so litle helpe from their predecessours, haue notwithstanding left great light vnto vs, so that being be trusted, but (as it were) with one talent, by their diligent trauel and occupying they haue made it fiue, I do not see, but that it may wel stand with the modes∣tie of a Christian of our time, being so richly left, and entering vpon so great a stocke, to trauel at the reckoning to be found at the lest to haue gayned something: nay, I do not see how we shal auoide the iust reproche of vnfaithful stewardes, if so many ta∣lents increase nothing vnder our handes: so farre am I from imagining that the blame of noueltie or any suche thing, hathe in it iust cause to stay our trauell, or hinder our labour in that behalfe.
And for the other charge (of treading in the same steppes with them that haue gone before vs) if that course should be taken, there is much that might be saide for it. For the same meate which beeing prepared by one, doth please the taste and stomach: beeing dressed by another, we haue no suche sauour in it: and surely the affections of men stande no lesse diuersly affected towardes the varietie of Gods giftes in deliuering one and the same matter, then doth the stomache toward the diuersitie of dressing of one and the same kinde of meate, so that in so great diuersitie a man may with modestie hope to be directed vnto some, who shall finde themselues hol∣pen by his handeling of the matter, albeit no other thing be brought beside that which hath beene heard of before: For as

the Lord will alway haue this aduantage againste the wicked for the cleareing of his iustice, that it may truely be said vnto them, in respect of the varietie of Gods giftes graunted them: We haue piped vnto you, but ye haue not daunsed:Luke▪ 7.31. we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not wept: so wil he magnifie his mercie towardes those that be his, in graunting them suche varietie of giftes, as no man shalbe so affected, but that he shall finde a helpe prepared, whereby he may be benefi∣ted. We see then, that either of these courses hathe not onely sufficient defence to cleare it, but also muche to be saide in the cōmendation of the same. The Christian Reader shal perceiue in perusing this treatise of the lawe, that my trauel hath beene to let him see, that Christ is a Sauiour in deede vnto him, that he might perceiue the length, bredth, and depth of his mercies, and so be brought to imbrace them accordingly. And because the greatnesse of our corruption discouereth the riches of his grace, which is by so much the richer, as the pouertie is greater which it doth relieue: I haue laboured therefore to lay out our pouertie & want in euerie particular commandement, & how our affection standeth naturally not indifferent, but an vtter enimie to the obedience required in the same: that in the sight of so muche rebellion and sinne, bleeding (as it were) in euerie part of vs of some deadly wound, we might slacke no time in see∣king vnto Christ Iesus the only Physician of our soule: and con∣sidering the number and daunger of those wounds that he doth cure and couer in vs, we might neuer forget or smally account of, but alwayes worthily magnifie the greatnesse of his grace and mercie towards vs.
Which manner of proceeding (if it be indifferently exami∣ned) shall be found to haue great fruite and profite in it: For to make vs carefull in seeking after Physick, this is not sufficient, that we knowe our selues to be diseased and sick, but to know a number of diseases to be growing vppon vs, & those of that

quantitie that euery of them threatneth present death, haue∣ing infected the principall partes of our life: that is it which maketh a man with all speede to take him to the remedie ap∣pointed for the same. Many there are, who will not denye themselues to be sinners and sicke of sinne: but because they neither knowe how many partes are infected, nor yet howe daungerous their infection is, their care to be releeued is the smaller, and their labour the lesse to bee ridd of it. Where∣vppon also it followeth, that he is so much the lesse regarded who is to worke that cure vppon them: so that we see this ge∣nerall lapping vp of sinne, when it is not vnfolden to our con∣sciences and layd out in the seuerall braunches thereof, is not only hurtful vnto vs, but also iniurious vnto the due estima∣tion of the death of Christe. I cannot more fitlie compare those men (who will most willingly confesse them selues in generall words to be sinners, and yet are very loath to be troubled with any particular knowledge thereof) then vnto some notori∣ous offenders against the lawes and peace of their prince, who can willingly heare these generall wordes, that they bee offen∣ders, and haue not kept the seuerall statutes and lawes of their prince, so that they will proceede no further with them: but to be brought foorth and charged with their seuerall fel∣lonies, murthers, or treasons that they haue committed, and to haue their wickednesse particularly layd out in number of dedes, & manner of doing, that may best set out the heynous∣nesse thereof, that, in no ease, may be abidden: and yet notwith∣standing before that time, neither is their owne estate greatly feared, nor yet the lawe so much as thought vppon how to bee satisfied. It is this particular sight of sinne that sendeth vs forthwith vnto Christ, and maketh him appeare both glorious in the multitude of his so greate mercies, and moste necessarie in the consideration of our so many daungerous infirmities.
If it please the Reader in the examining of him selfe in any commaundement, foorthwith to ioyne to the same that which is written here of the properties of loue, and that other nexte

Lecture of the vse of the lawe: he shall finde (I hope) some helpe in them, the sooner to departe from him selfe, and the more carefully to imbrace Christe. And that he may be acquainted the better with my meaning, and purpose in this matter, I will giue him in fewe wordes the reason of the same.
I see in the lawe of God that we are not only forbidden the workes of our owne deuotion and intent, & bound to that choise of workes that God hath appointed in his word: but also that we are strictly charged to doe the same, all and euerie one of them in loue, which is an affection that carrieth a man so in delight after the thinges which he loueth, that he oftentimes forget∣teth himselfe in respect thereof, according as it is reported by the holy Ghost (as a propertie to know it by) that loue seketh not her owne thinges. This is the cause why after the commande∣mentes I haue set downe the notes and properties to discerne loue by, that when we haue seene what workes they be that we are bound to doe, we may also see with what affection we are charged to do thē: that we may be as careful to bring the right manner of doing vnto the Lord, as the verie deede that he ap∣proueth. For we are as well to perfourme duetie in the manner of doing, as in the deed it selfe: It is one and the same God who hath inioyned both vnto vs, and therefore may not be denyed in either of them. The vse of the lawe which is in the Lecture following, wil declare with what conditions we haue wages pro∣mised for our worke, and whether the couenant be so fauoura∣ble as that we neede not to doubt, but that we shall be able to perfourme it, and therefore to liue in it: or otherwise so harde, (as the trueth is in verie deede) that he remayneth vnder the curse of God, who continueth not in all thinges that are written in the booke of the lawe to do them. Let vs then set these together. First, the number of deeds: then, the manner of doing, whiche must haue in it those properties that be in loue: and last of al, the hard condition, which is, not to haue our good doeings to blotte out and put off our euil, but to remaine vnder the curse, if we shall not continue in euerie thing that is writ∣ten

in the booke of the lawe to doe it: and then we shalbe for∣ced to giue ouer this strong holde, euen this confidence in our selues, and betake vs wholy to the mercie of our God, and mag∣nifie the same accordingly. And least we should imagine the matter of letting go the opinion of our selues and our worthi∣nesse to be nothing so hard as is supposed, and therefore no such nede to haue so often before vs in meditation and earnest con∣sideration thereof the multitude of deedes to be doone, the louing manner of doing, and the hard condition if they shall not be doone: Let vs aduisedly consider, how that singular in∣strument of God S. Paule confesseth, that he himselfe was so subiect vnto this ouer great opinion of him self, that the messenger of sathan was sent vnto him to buffet him,2. Cor. 12.7 leaste hee should be puffed vp with the measure of graces, whiche were giuen vnto him. The daunger is greater therefore then we are aware of, when so rare an instrument and chosen seruaunt of GOD as was Paule, so hardely and with so much a doe, is brought to haue an humble opinion of him selfe and his wor∣thinesse.
The Romish religion likewise (fighting so stoutely for the deserte of man) may teach vs, that this doctrine of true hum∣bling and submitting of our selues vnto our God, wil not so ea∣silie enter into fleash and bloud, as at the first we would ima∣gine: but that we haue neede often to set before vs this looke∣ing glasse of the lawe, in manner as hath beene declared, to humble vs withall: and all shall bee founde little inoughe to bring vs truely from our selues, and to sende vs, not in parte, but wholy, vnto the mercies of our GOD, whiche are de∣clared vnto vs at large in the next Lecture after the vse of the lawe.
When we shall haue profited in drawing nere vnto Christ, and making much of his mercie, by an often and true sight of our selues in the lawe, there is yet remayning an other vse and fruite to be taken by it, of no lesse profite then the former: whiche is, that when wee shall haue taken comforte in

the mercies of Christ, and decreed to walke in the obedience of his will, to declare our thankefulnesse thereby: the lawe will stand vs in good stead to quicken vs therevnto, while wee learne by it, bothe the number of things that are to be done, and also the backwardnesse of our naturall disposition and in∣clination therevnto: which we could not once (without this admonition from the lawe) haue suspected to haue beene so greate, and therefore our care to suppresse it, would haue bene so much the lesse. But hauing determined once to walke in the wayes of his commaundements, and then hauing warning from the lawe, that there is bothe in our witt and will enimi∣tie therevnto, altogether bent to resist it: it can not but in∣crease our care, and add vnto our paines and trauaile, for the atteining vnto that end of obedience which we haue propoun∣ded vnto vs. For the man who hath a desire vnto any thinge, vnderstanding once of any let in the way, is thereby more pro∣uoked and stirred vp to bestowe cares and paines vppon the same: knowing very well, that the thing which he desireth can not otherwise be compassed.
And where is that man then, that seeing what duties are to be perfourmed bothe to the Lord, and to his brethren, and in what manner of affection and loue, (for it is the end of Christe his death, and the purchase of his passion to haue a number not only giuen, but zelously giuen vnto good workes) remembring withall, what an enimie he hath at home of his owne nature, if there be any feare of God in him, that shall not be occasioned hereby more plentifully to practise the meanes of his saluation: especially knowing, that those who are ingraf∣ted into the body of Christe, must dye vnto sinne and rise vp in to these fruites of righteousnes? Moreouer the knowledge and meditation of the lawe and commaundements, doe helpe vs forward vnto true and sincere Christianitie. For a great num∣ber deceiue them selues in a generall good meaning whiche they haue to serue the Lord, taking that to be the true seruice of him: and in the meane time are nothing carefull to keepe a

good conscience in the seuerall dueties of the lawe, nor any thing traueyling to traine vp their affections to delight ther∣in: as if in Christianitie we were to roue vncerteinely aboute good motions and good meanings, and had no certeine marks of seuerall dueties set before vs to shoote at, that we might so iudge of our selues, as we see vs come shorte or wide of them: whereas the true Christian, in very deede profiteth in drawing neerer and neerer vnto the Lord, in making his life and con∣uersation more conformable vnto the seuerall duties set downe in the commaundementes, beeing likewise carefull to approue his doings by the lawes & statutes made for the same, as in ciuil dealings and traffique, a man wil feare to offende against the lawes and statutes prouided in that behalfe. And as a wise man that hath much dealing in the worlde, wil haue some abstract of the statutes, that (as occasion requireth) he may turne to them, and so deale without danger of lawe: so it standeth well with the policie of a Christian, to be skilfull in the statutes of his God, that when he hath to deale with the name of his brother, lookeing in this abstract, he may see the cautions to be obserued in the same, that he offend not against the lawes and statutes of the Highest: & when soeuer he hath to deale with his goodes, he may turne in like maner to that statute that hath prouided for wel dealing therin, & so auoide the dangers that otherwise he should fall into. The like is to be done, when there are dealings immediately betwene vs & the Lord, that we should often loke into this briefe abstract of the statutes of our God, to see alwayes what is the prouiso that is made for his glorie, and the suppressing of our owne corrupti∣on. Our corrupte nature doeth aske all this of vs, and the man that feareth God giueth no lesse vnto it. For the blessed man is saide to meditate in the lawe of his God day and night. Nay, we see that the only wise God (who knoweth better then we our selues what nede we haue) hath appointed vs yet more meanes, and therfore we must thinke that there is more vnto∣wardnes in vs, then we could of our selues suspect. For he hath

left it a perpetuall order for the education of his children, that there should be men of special giftes, both for learning and apt∣nesse to teach, & also for good life: who by teaching, exhorting, and reprouing, should (as it were) whet the word to make it en∣ter. It must of necessitie bee an hard matter, that requireth such instruments, & such workemen, for both the instrument and the workmen are from aboue: The wisedome of the world could not perfourme this, and therefore the Gospell (which is the arme and power of God vnto saluation) was sent from the bosome of the father: and for the workemen, we are not at our choyse to take where it seemeth good vnto vs, but they are ap∣pointed to our hād by the holy Ghost, who hath set downe such notes of good learning & good life to discerne them by, who are of his sending, and fit for so weightie a worke, as that they giue forth a plaine testimonie vnto vs, that they come from Hea∣uen, framed and prepared of the Lord him self vnto this work.
As the goodnesse of our God could not deny vs any thing necessarie, so his wisedome would not that we should be loaden with any thing superfluous and vnnecessarie, which must force vs to conclude against our selues, that we are not knowen vn∣to our selues, vnlesse we see matter within vs, necessarily re∣quiring to be pricked forward with the liuely preaching and sounding ministerie of the word: and that we tempt the Lord, if we content our selues with our priuate readings and medi∣tations, and despise the preaching of the worde: which the Lord hath seene to be so necessarie, that hee hath appointed it not for one sorte of men, but vnto all, of what condition soeuer: neither vnto age alone, but perpetuall for all ages and times. The labours therefore of them that doe write, are not taken in hand, that men standing vpon them, should contemne or lesse frequent the publique ministerie of the Church: but to bring them into greater loue and liking with the same, that recei∣uing some fruite that way, they might looke for a greate deale more by that which is appoynted by the Lorde,Col. 1.21 to present vs perfect in Christe Iesus.
Concerning these Lectures, I am to craue generally of all men to whose handes they shall come, that in what point so euer they shall thinke their admonition may doe mee good, they woulde not denie mee that Christian and Brotherly helpe: and likewise if they shall in any thing finde them∣selues holpen by my trauell, that as they are to returne the whole praise vnto GOD (to whome onely it is due) so they woulde not denie the comfort of their prayers vnto him, whom the Lord in mercie hath vouchsafed to make an instru∣ment (though most vnworthie) of some goodnesse vnto them. And of your honour (my verie good Ladie) I am most humblie to require, that this dutie (how slenderly soeuer performed) may according to your accustomed clemencie be well accepted of: that what want soeuer be in the work, either of that you desire, or that I were in duetie to perfourme, may finde a supplie here∣in, for that it proceedeth from a minde moste willing to answer your desire, and moste vnwilling (if abilitie did serue) to be be∣hinde with the leaste parte of that, that duetie may in any respect demaunde.
And as al good Christians should rather be desirous to lerne howe to go forwarde, then to heare what good beginnings they haue made, so I doubt not (Madame) but a fewe wordes vt∣tered to that ende (especially from me that haue great cause to be thankeful vnto God, for that he hath already wrought in you) shall finde better interteinement with your honour, then much speeche directed to an other purpose, howe good and iust soeuer the cause be that might prouoke me thervnto. It was a saying sometime of Asia, that it was no prayse neuer to haue seene it, but to haue liued temperately in Asia, was praise wor∣thie: so many were the allurements, & so great was the intem∣perancie thereof. I thinke we may nowe (altering the words) reteine the trueth of the matter, if we should say: it were no great matter, neuer to haue seene the Courtes of Princes, but to haue liued Christianly in those Courtes, were a special work of Christ in his. And therefore (Madame) as sometimes I

spake in the hearing of your honour, so nowe I say againe, that where the assault of the aduersarie lyeth sorest against any, there wisedome would, that the instruments to beare off and to beate backe the same, should be more in number, and stronger in effect. And for this cause we do reade, that in the Courte of Israel the Prince himselfe, who for the number and weight of affaires was (as may be thought) by some iust title to be pri∣uileged aboue the rest, might not be exempted from keeping this diligent watch and warde in his owne person, (by reading all the dayes of his life in the lawes of his God) against the dangers that by reason of that place he was in great danger of: diuers wherof, after they are recited in Deuteronomie, imme∣diately the holy Ghost giueth the medicine for them, whiche is, to be occupied in the lawes of his God, all the dayes of his life. If any by daily meditation in the lawe of God,Pro. 4.8. shall thus exalt wisdome (that is the word of God) by making it the chief delighte of their heart, beside the auoyding of these daungers and suche like, there is a promise passed from the Lord, that wisedome shall exalt them. If they shall sett her in place and estimation aboue all other things, she will requite it againe, by aduauncing their honour and estate aboue the condition of others: but if they shall make no more of her, but as a common thing, she wil answer them in like measure againe, to leaue thē in place & estimation with the common & worst sort of men.
The honour therfore of aduauncement (which all men are giuen to haue so great lyking of) commeth neither from the East nor frō the West, but from the Lord him self: & this true honour wayteth vpon all of them, whom imploy them selues, their countenance and their credite, to honour and aduaunce this wisedome, which is the worde of God. Which thing that it may abound in you (Madame) daily more and more, and in his honour to whome the Lorde hath ioyned you, and that by the meanes thereof, you may so continue your life, as that you shall not feare to dye, as in dutie I am for ma∣ny

benefites receiued moste bounden: so I doe moste humbly craue it of our mercifull GOD, to whose fatherly proui∣dence (ceassing to adde any thing further, and re∣mayning to perfourme all duties, from time to time that I shall bee enabled vnto) I do most humbly com∣mittee your Honour. (¿?¿)
