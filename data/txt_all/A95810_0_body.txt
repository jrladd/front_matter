Illustrious Stranger,
PArdon my giving You a Name, since You have not been plea∣sed
to make Your Self known to me by any: Pardon my not giving 
 
 You a Name and Titles which
might better suit Your High Quality: Possibly I might not see thorow
Your Disguise. However, suffer me, Great SIR, to make Use of
this Ignorance to co∣ver my not knowing how to converse with a Person so
much Above me: I take the Oppor∣tunity of Your Vailing Your Self, to Approach
You: As we can better behold the Sun when it Vails it Self, than
when it breaks through the Clouds.
Whatever might a lit∣tle hide Your Greatness, no Outward
Cloathing could hinder me from seeing the Excellencies of Your Mind: The Idea
I received of that, En∣couraged me to pay the small Homage of Pre∣senting
these Papers. The Mixture that is of mine in them, shews the Darkness and Barrenness of my Mind; and great∣ly needs Your Charity
and Humility to cover its Imperfection. What there is in them worthy Your
Observation, is not mine, but as it is Freely Given, and Passively
Re∣ceived.
If I have any sight at all, I tasted a little of the Honey of
the Hea∣venly Canaan, and my Eyes are Enlightened; My
blind Eyes have been Anointed with Eye-Salve; and I see, tho' it be but
little, Men as Trees.
Excellent SIR,
Accept this small Tri∣bute; Accept it as an Ex∣pression of
Gratitude for the most High and Noble Favours: Receive it as the Greatest
Act of Charity and Humility You can Exercise; especially if You
please to pardon my calling You my Friend, who am not Worthy to
be
