My most Honored Lord!
WHen I reflect (as oft times I have caus to do upon the Pro∣vidence, which hath been over mee since I have offered my self unto the Publick; and upon the hand by which that Providence hath supported and directed mee in my waie; I finde that it hath made use of none to car∣rie

mee on to becom serviceable, so much as of your Lordship's favor and affection. For as you were the first that took notice of my inclination, to bee encouraged in the waies which I have followed; so your eye hath been all along upon mee therein. In my straights, whereinto my forwardness hath from time to time brought mee; I have found the tenderness of your sens, and bow∣els to bee like unto that of a Father. You have in private put to your hand, and set your heart to free mee from them; & in pub∣lick you have owned mee towards the Par∣lament, and procured an aspect from that High and Honorable Court towards mee, to set mee apart as an Agent for the Ad∣vancement of Universal Learning and the Publick Good, which I confess is an Em∣ploiment, whereunto from my youth God God hath naturalized my affections. And since this Publick designment of my Em∣ploiment, it hath been your influence upon, and concurrence with other noble and wor∣thie Instruments, whom you have quickned, which hath made that settlement, which

doth promise so much inlargement to my steps, in my future courses effectual. All this I am bound to observ and acknowledg with most heartie thankfulness unto God not one∣ly by reason of the refreshments, which the Lord hath thereby conveighed unto mee from your hand, but by reason of the Prin∣ciple, which moved you hereunto, and the Aim which you have had therein, which I know to have been none other but the Pub∣lick; and therein the advancement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ; so that the hope which wee have to partake of the Salvation of Israël, which shall com out of Sion by a Gospel-Reformation of this Age and Com∣mon wealth, hath been the Center wherein our Aims have alwaies met. For I am per∣suaded that the ground of all the good will, of the Bountie and of the Care, which abundantly hath been bestowed upon mee, hath been none other, but the freeness of your spirit in the love of the things, which are most excellent, wherein you found mee conversant, and which you are delighted to set forward. Whence it is that I conceiv

it my dutie, to present unto your Lordship in a more direct and eminent waie then unto others, the fruits of my Negotiation, chiefly such as relate immediately unto the great Object of our Hope; of which kinde this present Treatise is a special and signal Discoverie. Therefore give mee leav to make of it a publick offer unto your Patron∣age, not onely as a Testimonie of the fore∣mentioned Obligations, by which my Spi∣rit in the sight of Christ is entirely engaged towards his Grace in You; but as a Sub∣ject of my Agencie to solicite, that by the countenance of your Autoritie it may bee recommended to such, as know what the Communion of Saints doth mean in the Kingdom of Heaven, that there may bee a reciprocation of love in the gifts of the Spirit, between us and others the Members of Jesus Christ abroad; and that the things mentioned in the Preface, as means to accomplish our hopes, which yet lie under deck, by the building up of the walls of Jerusalem in the mindes of Believers, may bee drawn

forth; and the faithful and indefatiga∣ble Co-Agent therein, beeing put in a capacitie to prepare his seed to bee sown by the working out of his proper tasks; may finde opportunities which will oblige him seasonably to sow it, by speaking out that which at present can bee but hinted, and intimated in reference to the opening of the Principles, upon which the build∣ing of the Temple in Heaven is raised, and by which it will com down from the New Heaven upon the New Earth, to bee the Tabernacle of God with men. Thus beseeching the Father of Lights to reveal more and more these glorious ap∣proaching Truths: and the Righteous Judg to give a Crown to all the labors of Love, which you have, or shall undergo for his name's sake, I subscribe my self
My most Honored Lord
