YOu gallant Youthes, who are of minde, rather addicted to tra∣uaile, through the world for experience in the diuersities, as well of Countreis, as customes: of men, as of manners: of lan∣guages, as of other laudable points, too te∣dious to discourse of: as well to the com∣modity of your cuntry comfort of your pa∣rents, content, of your freends as cheefly to your owne aduauncement: rather then to sit at home, as a chicke vnder a broode hen, esteeming warmth, the chiefest wis∣dome: golde, their god: and a whole skinne aboue an honourable name: As many, the more pittie, by too much dandling of their Dads & making of their Mams do now

a daies. To you my young Mates Isay. I here vnnamed (as younge as one) hauing lately taken in hand to passe a long Pyl∣gremage to Parnassus hil, to Pallas and her Nimphes, to sue for a schollarship in the Schoole of Vertu: I was not far out of mine owne cuntrey, but suddenlie in a place vnknowne, a leage or two from any Towne, vnperfect to returne the way I went: standinge in a muze a while, not knowinge what best to doo, seeinge ma∣nie footepathes leadinge diuerse waies: at laste I thought good to take the moste beaten way, as moste likely, to leade mee to some place of habitation, where for that night to take vp my lodginge, and the next morninge to enquire further onwarde on my Iourney. But not bea∣ringe in minde that the broade waies are commonly beaten with beastes: And the

foote pathes I mean are euer very narrow I foolishly folowed the Coxcomes Causey before me, which led me on a long streight to the forest of fooles, and so to the fort of Fancy: of which Forte, cum pertinen∣cijs, of my comming thither, abode there, and return frō thence, I haue more largly then learnedly discoursed. Yet as it is, I hope it will serue your turnes (though not as a direction to the place I ment to go too, yet as a diswasion (in your trauaile) from that way, that hath led mee so much out of the way before you. Thus hoping to turne the thriftlesse fruit of my fond tra∣uaile, to the commoditie of a great many of yee: that I hope some of yee will one day thancke me for: I wish you all, with my selfe, in trauaile, to treade the path that may bring vs all to perfect paradise.
