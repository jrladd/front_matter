MOST Honoured Lord, I know, you neither like, nor have leisure, to looke upon trifles; but I know also, you account not discourses of Piety, in the number of trifles: This makes

mee bold to present your Lordship, with this short Treatise of Medita∣tions; that being short, it may not di∣vert you long; being Pious, not di∣vert you at all. J so much honour your Lordship, for your publicke ver∣tues; so much am bound to you, for your private; that J cannot forbeare to present you with something, as a testimony of my service in both: and a richer present I could not thinke of, than Meditations upon this Psalme of David; which is indeede, the Master-piece of his Repentance, as his Repentance the Master-piece of all his Vertues. The Jewell it selfe is from David, onely the Case from me; and though the Jewell deserve a more Illustri∣ous Case; and your Person a more

Jllustrious present; yet there is colour to hope I may bee pardoned in both; seeing, the Jewels splendour, gives a lustre to any case; and your Noble∣nesse, to any present. And though it might bee presented with a better hand; yet it cannot with a better heart; seeing he presents it, that is
Your Lordships humble and devoted servant,
RICHARD BAKER.
