Right Honourable, and Right Worp.ll
HAving lately pervsed a scandulous Pam∣phlett, publikely sold in the Hague, both in English and Dutch, reflecting upon the Councills and Actions of Kings, and Prin∣ces, Intituled Englands Appeale, from the private Caball at white hall, to the great Councill of the Nation, The Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled. I perceived the Hollanders under a disguise, and the Authours of it, to be as much mistaken in their ac∣counts, concerning France, as they are of the con∣sequences of this warr, and how the warr begun, from whence they would conclude that the Kings

Ministers had dependences upon Forraigne Courts, hauing taken noe care of the Triple League, or the Protestant interest, wherefore I breifly recollected theise few Remarkable Passages, that may serve to vndeceive some English men, who peradventure might be deluded by the appeale, and annexed Sir William Courtens Cases, in severall languages, to satis∣fie all Persons interessed, that Comon Justice is not to be found in the Low Countries. I presume that your Lord.•p and the rest of your Bretheren in the Honourable Goverment, of the Citty of London, upon pervsall of this small treatise, will apprehend that the Hollanders, are not soe high and mighty, as they are insolent, and ungratefull. There are seve∣rall faire prospects now from the Netherlands (where nature is supported by art) towards London, that may make it the most glorious Citty in the world. Theise short remarques, and Animadversions, may helpe to refress your memory, in many things, and shew you in severall Paragraphes that the Hollanders have gotten ground upon the English, since the death of Queene Elizebeth, Notwithstanding all the advantages, that God and Nature have given to Great Brittaigne, aboue all other Kingdomes, and Nations, in the World. I leave the rest to your most grave, and serious con∣siderations and remayne

Hague Decemb. 16. 1673.
