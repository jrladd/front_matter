MOST no∣ble my good Lord:
My decea∣sed Father very oftē sur∣uaied the Kings Lands, but now by me he hum∣bly tenders himselfe to



be suruaied by you. This small Treatise (the issue not of his body, but his braine) he left with vs his children, to assure vs, and al men that himselfe chiefly studied and sha∣ped his courses so to dye that he might neuer dye, & that he prepared him∣selfe so to depart frō the earth, that when he did leaue the Earth he had no other busines but to leaue the Earth, for his actions were but an ex∣ample



of his precepts.
Now my very noble Lord, my poore selfe be∣ing a dependant vpon your honored House, ha∣uing nothing in me to expresse my obliged du∣ty; no not so much as aduise or wishes, (since your being good & per∣formance of goodnesse makes all my wishes vaine) I beseech you but to read and suruay not what you should doe, but what you haue done,



that your sanctified dis∣creetnesse may be a mir∣ror to others, and an in∣forcement to me euer to remaine,
