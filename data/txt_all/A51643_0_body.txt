MY LORD,
THe secret love of Hero and
Leander first brought to
light in the pure Greeke of
divine Musaeus, was after∣ward
new moulded in Latin
by the fluent Ovid; in imita∣tion
of whose Epistles, the most eminent Poëts
of all Climates have (in their native languages)

written upon this subject so many Paraphrases
and Essayes, that like the numerous streames
of Nile, they almost overflow the remem∣brance
of their fountaine. I confesse the report
of Poëms borrowed from Musaeus made so
great a noyse, that to mee the Authour had
beene lost in the crowd of his Imitatours, if I
had not heard his soft lines sweetned by your
Lordship's accent; but then, I could not be sa∣tisfied
till I made triall how the Greeke would
goe in English: my intent being to translate
and dedicate it privately to your Lordship.
The Translation was forthwith dispatched, the
Dedication is now presented, but the intended
Privacie lay not in my power; for my acquain∣tance
(who would know what I was doing) had
ingaged me for so many Copies, that I held it
my safest course, rather to venture upon the
Printers pardonable errours, then to runne the
hazzard of grosse mistakes in ignorant Tran∣scribers.
Yet, as I could not make it altogether

private, so I resolved it should not be altogether
publique, and have therefore suffered no more
to be printed, then the just number promised;
which coming into friends hands, I cannot
feare any rigid censure. But if some pretending
Criticke shall assault mee, I shall smile to see
him retire with double speed, beholding the
name of the illustrious and learned person that
privileges
