WHether yee eate or
drinke, or whatsoeuer
ye doe, do all to the
glorie of God, as the
Apostle saith. Which
when I remembred,
to the glorie of my
creator, and benefite of his church, I
thought good to commit this little trea∣tise
to writing, preached at the buriall of
your motherinlaw, a noble Ladie, a faith∣full
wife, a vertuous woman, and a godly
widow. And because your Ladishippe
(whose giftes of bodie and minde are
excellent) heard it with attention, as you
do alwaies the word of truth (to gods
praise and your owne commendation be
it spoken) I tooke it meete to dedicate it
to you for a New yeares gift, and decla∣ration

of my thankfull mind, for your
manifold courtesies towardes me. And
forasmuch, as the daies are euill, (sinne a∣bounding,
and charitie being cold) I haue
therefore set downe the iudgements of
God against the dissolute people of this
age, which haue a shew of godlines, but
haue denied the power thereof. And see∣ing
they giue themselues to commit all
sinne, euen with greedines, being proude
without humilitie, malicious without
charity, cruell without compassion, coue∣teous
without measure, vaine without
vertue, vile without the feare of God, like
to the horse and mule in whom is no vn∣derstanding:
therefore they shall vn∣doubtedly
tast the bitter cuppe of Gods
heauie displeasure, except they speedily
and truely repent. Which, if they shall do,
though their sinnes were as crimsin, they
shall be made white as snowe: though
they were red as skarlet, they shall bee
as wooll, and that they may so do, I daiely
and deuoutly craue of God, in the grati∣ous
name, and glorious face of Iesus Christ
his sonne: who gaue him selfe for vs, to
redeeme vs from all iniquitie, and to

purge vs to bee a peculiar people vnto
himselfe zealous of good workes. To
him therefore with the Father and the
holy Ghost three in persons, one God
in nature, be all glorie
for euer,
