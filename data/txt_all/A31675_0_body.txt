I Shall not need to bespeak thee Cour∣teous,
if thou hast seen this Piece pre∣sented
with all the Elegance of Life
and Action on the Black-Friers Stage;
But if it be a Stranger to thee, give me
leave to prepare thy acceptation, by tel∣ling
thee, it was receiv'd with general
applause, and thy judgement (I doubt
not) will be satisfied in the reading.
I will not raise thy Expectation fur∣ther,
nor delay thy Entertainment by
a tedious Preface. The Design is high,
the Contrivement subtle, and will
deserve thy grave Attention in the
perusall.
Farewell.
