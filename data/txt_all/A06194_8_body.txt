Grace in this vvorld, and ioy in the other.
ALL happines in the lord Iesus. I present vnto you a part of Ieremies Lamentations meta∣phrased. You may see herein my true hart vnto you all. In the midst of lamentable discōtents I tuned my soule, tongue, &

pen to the land of god. And the rather in these lamentations for that they sorted some vvhat to my retired meditations. One tyme, or other all men are not as they vvould be. It is the condition of gods children. Happie is that man that can vse gods scourge to his amen dement. The great modera∣tor of all things knovves his children fittest to be made palmes, to be spread vvith burthens, & vvaights, & not to be Oliues. That so vve might more thinke of our victorie, then of our rest. It is enoughe for vs that vve shall once triumph in heauen, & rest for all. To this holy rest, and eternall tranquillity god∣giude

vs all, into vvhose blessed keeping I recommend you in Christ sauing mercies. And rest.
