Sir,
THe greatness of your birth and actions hath raysed you to a degree of glory, whither envie it self (which attends upon Thrones) can not aspire. I should believe I could not undertake to publish those advantages without darkening their lu∣stre, if I did not know that it is equally impossi∣ble to illustrate and obscure their splendour. That knowledge might serve me both for my excuse and my justification, if I had rashnesse enough to speak of them. But that undertaking can produce no other effect, then absolutely to convince mee of weaknesse and presumption. I will leave it to Histories, to relate the noble∣nesse of your race, and Germany who must con∣fesse that shee owes you for the greatest part of her glory, will not admit me to share in the ho∣nour of writing your Elogy: But you need no Panegyrick, the plain recitall of those brave a∣ctions you have done, will expresse them with more efficacy then the most skilfull pens of the world: And it were in some sort to profane your
heroïque actions, to rank them with those which require or can tolerate commendations. Nor is it Germany alone that can tell those won∣drous actions, although that during those years which you spent there, she never saw any thing more illustrious; yet she never saw the more glo∣rious things which you have done: you fought for their interests, when those of your own Country permitted you to carry your armes in∣to forreigne nations; but as soon as you was needfull to them, you had no other aime but their advantage, and sought for no other glory, then that which might be acquired in the exe∣cution of their enterprizes, and in the advance∣ment of their designes. The services you have rendred them, are of the nature of those whose fame is displayed over the whole Earth: But this is yet too little for the glory of your name, you have carried it to the new World, where you have had the applause of the whole Army: But I see that I begin to stray, and seeking to follow you in the path of glory, I am in danger to loose my self in that of confusion; 'tis this which obli∣ges me wholly to the termes of Admiration and silence, which I will not break but to intreat you to accomplish that vast number of favours with which you have honored me both in France and here, by the protection of this work: it need
not fear any thing if you allow it an asylum with you, and the most injurious darts of envie can not hurt it, while you shelter it under the shades of your laurells. That generosity with which you oblige strangers, and the numerous favours, which you have already so freely conferred upon mee, make me hope, you will not deny mee the favour of this liberty to speak my self,
Sir
