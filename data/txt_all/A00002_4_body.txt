MY deare Vrania wilt thou now forsake
My Cottage, and to Court thy selfe betake?
Dost hope thou there, as here shalt find retire?
I cannot but thy simplenesse admire.
But since thou needs wilt goe, I'le thee commend
vnto the Muses most familiar Friend;
Who (had not his great Princes Loue and Grace
Him brought from Muses Groues to's Royall place)
Might on his Front haue worne thy Crowne of Bays,
And beene the Prince of Poets in his dayes.
Hee'le leaue all profit, pleasure, honour gaine,
The heav'nly Muse alone to entertaine;
Oh happy Court! most blessed Courtiers yee,
That from the Muses Springs transplanted bee,
This 'tis makes Arts, and Learning so increase,
Hence followeth all our happinesse and Peace:
The Muses needs must dance when Courtiers sing,
All follow the example of the King.

Yours truly deuoted.
R. A.
