MY good Father, the Loue
that I haue euer noted in
you, to all good Spirits, and
especially the Learned, with
the bande of many good fa∣uours;
wherein I am indeb∣ted
to your kindnes, made
mee in this little porticall Rownd, to shew you
the labour of my Spirit; which with my harti
loue I commende to your kinde acceptation:
the Tract is short, and the Lessons not vnne∣cessarie

for old men to read, and young men to
follow: Some lines may seeme prettie, other
pleasant; and some perhaps not vnprofitable:
As they bee, I leaue them to your leysure to
peruse, and your pleasure to make vse of: And
so loth to be tedious in a trifle; wing you
Craesus treasure, with your Spirits better com∣fort,
and continuall health and happines: In
prayer for the same, in all thankfulnes for your
euer vndeserued kidnes: I rest.
