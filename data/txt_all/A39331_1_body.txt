Right Honourable, Honourable; and ever to be honour'd Heroes:
WHose Honors joyntly, and severally are all sprung more from your just deserts, than ambitious desires; whose provident industry for this Citie and Kingdoms security, shall more eternize your Names unto Posterity, than your magnificent opulencie can make you after Death survive, and flourish in your hopefull issue. Since it al∣ways seem'd good in your Eyes, (even from my first initiation into your Mili∣tary Service, (more out of an in-nate humanity of yours, wherewith your Ho∣nours
