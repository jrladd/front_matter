RIght Honourable, Master Tombes having here∣tofore set forth an Exercitation, in doubtfull termss against Childrens baptisme; your Petitio∣ner perusing the severall answers that were made to him seeing they walked in the tracke, and had not stated up the question to the hight, as the Scriptures would afford, to the stopping the mouth of the Anabaptists; your Petitioner, as the necessary imployment of his cure would permit, hath put his hand to the worke, whereupon Master Tombes hath taken liberty to sleight him, and accuse him in generall termes with all kinde of mistakes, citing two or three which are indeed no mistakes but truths, wrapping up all the rest thus: that his booke is nothing else but mistakes, which is most uncivill, and in an Heretike, as your Petitioner humbly conceiveth, worthy your Honours censure; the rather because he hath taken libertie to write against the Directory, and unjustly charging it with falshood; calling it a cothurnus, fit∣ter for a counsell of Trent, then a Protestant Church: And that upon a false ground, as your Petitioner will cleerly prove; so as Master Marshall, who is concerned in the busi∣nesse, and otherwise publiquely imployed, will put the mat∣ter ever to him; and Master Tombes shall be first ordered
to answer his booke, or renounce his Anabaptisme, which in civill right he ought to doe; generall charges being calum∣nies, and not answers, so as they reflect on your Petitioner: and as the matter is Anabaptisme it is of publike concern∣ment. Your Petitioner doth humbly beseech your Honours at least to keepe these vaunting Heretiques within the bounds of civility, and not permit them to rayle at Orthodox Wri∣ters and call them fooles without any reason, for writing such things as the Learned Grammarians, and Translatours of the Scripture will warrant them to write, leaving these writings they cannot answer, and yet persist in their errours.
And for that Bachelor, your Petitioner doth humbly de∣sire that he may not any longer be permitted to licence books, unlesse he had more skill to looke unto them, for that he hath put the stampe of Learning, Ingenuity, Piety, upon such a pamphlet as hath rayled at the Directory & other Orthodox Writers without ground. I wish that some schoole of Divini∣ty were set up, where Master Tombes and such other dis∣contented persons might have full liberty to vent their opi∣nions, and not permitted to poyson the people.
