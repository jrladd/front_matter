EVen as the Eagle through the empty skie,
Conuoies her young ones on her soaring wings,
Aboue the azur'd vaults, till shee them brings,
Where they on Phoebus glorious beames may pry:
So (mighty Prince) my Muse now soares on high,
Aboue the vulgar reach, to higher spheares,
With this scarse ripened Eaglet-birth of hers,
Vnto the view of your Maiestick eye,
But if it hap, as hap, I feare, it shall,
Shee may not bide your censures dazeling touch,
The higher flight, the more renowned fall,
It shall suffice, that her attempt was such,
But if in ought shee please your Princely view,
Then shee attaines the marke, at which she flew.
