great Judgment in these Studies, and Regard for them, late∣ly Honouring the Fa∣culty, with Encouraging so near and worthy a Relation of Your own in these Studies: Toge∣ther with Your Lord∣ship's condescending At∣tention, and favourable Regard to my weak Discourses, sometimes on such Subjects. These things, my Lord, have emboldned me to pre∣sent
