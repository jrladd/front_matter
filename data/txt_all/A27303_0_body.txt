My Lord,
WHen I consider how Ancient and Honourable a Date Plays have born, how they have been the pe∣culiar Care of the most Illustrious Persons of Greece and Rome, who strove as much to out doe each other in Magnificence, (when by Turns they manag'd the great Business, of the Stage, as if they had contended for the Victory of the Vniverse:) I say, my Lord, when I consider this, I with the greater Assurance most humbly address this Comedy to your Lordship, since by Right of Antient Custom, the Patronage of Plays belong'd only to the great Men, and chieest Magistrates. Cardinal Richelie, that great and wise Statesman, said, That there was no surer Testimony to be given of the flourishing Greatness of a Stars, than publick Pleasures and Divertise∣ments—for they are says e—the Schools of Vertue, where Vice is alays either  or disdain'd. They are seoret Instruitions to the People, in things that 'tis impossible to in∣sinuate into them any other Way. 'Tis Example that prevails above Reason or Divin Pcepts (Philosophy not un∣derstood by the ) 'tis Example alone that inspires Morality, and best establishes Verine. I have my self known a Man, whom neither Conscience nor Religion c'd perswade to Loyalty, who with beholding in our Theatre a Modern Poli∣tician

set forth in all his Colours, was converted, renounc'd his Opinion, and quitted the Party.
The Abbot of Aubignac, to shew that Plays have been ever held most important to the very Political Part of Govern∣ment, says, The Phylosophy of Greece, and the Majesty and Wisdom of the Romans, did equally concern their Great Men in making them Venerable, Noble and Magnificent: Venerable, by their Consecration to their Gods: Noble, by being govern'd by their chiefest Men; and their Magnificen∣cy was from the publick Treasury, and the liberal Contribu∣tions of their Noble Men.
It being undeniable then, that Plays and publick Diversions were thought by the Greatest and Wisest of States, one of the most essential Parts of good Government, and in which so many great Persons were interested; suffer me to beg your Lord∣ships Patronage for this little Endeavour, and believe it not below the Grandure of your Birth and State, the Illustri∣ous Places you so justly hold in the Kingdom, nor your Illustrious Relation to te greatest Monarch of the World, to afford it the Glory of your Protection; since it is the Product of a Heart and Pen, that always faithfully serv'd that Royal Cause, to which your Lordship is by many Tyes so firmly fixt. It approaches you with that absolute Veneration, that all the World is oblig'd to pay you; and has no other Design than to express my sense of those excellent Vertues, that make your Lordship so truly admir'd and lov'd. Amongst which we find those two so rare in a Great Man and a Statesman, those of Gracious Speech and easie Access, and I believe none were ever sent from your Presence dissatisfied. You have an Art to please even when you deny; and something in your Look and Voice has an Air so greatly good, it recompences even for Disappointment, and we never leave your Lordship but with Blessings. It is no less our Admiration, to behold with what Serenity and perfect Conduct, that great Part of the Nations Business is carry'd on, by one single Person; who having to do with so vast Numbers of Men of all Qualitys, Interests and Humours, nevertheless all are well satisfi'd, and none com∣plain of Oppression, but all is done with Gentleness and Si∣lence, as if (like the first Creator) you cou'd finish all by a

Word. You have, my Lord, a Judgment so pierg and solid, a Wisdom so quick and clear, and a Fortitude so truly Noble, that those Fatigues of State, that wou'd even sink a Spirit of less Magnitude, is by yours accomplish't without Toil, or any Appearance of that harsh and crabbed Austerity, that is usually put on by the bisy Great. You, my Lord, support the Globe, as if you did not feel its Weight; nor so much as seem to bend beneath it: Your Zeal for the Glorious Monarch you love and serve, makes all things a Pleasure that advance his Interest, which is so absolutely your Care. You are, my Lord, by your generous Candor, your unbyast Justice, your Sweetness, Affa∣bility and Condescending Goodness (those never-failing Marks of Greatness) above that Envy which reigns in Courts, and is aim'd at the most elevated Fortunes and Noblest Favourites of Princes: And when they consider your Lordship, with all the Abilitys and Wisdom of a great Counsellor, your unblemisht Vertue, your unshaken Loyalty, your constant Industry for the Publick Good, how all things under your Part of Sway have been refin'd and purg'd from those Grossnesses, Frauds, Bri∣berys, and Grievances, beneath which so many of his Majestys Subjects groan'd, when we see Merit establish't and prefer'd, and Vice discourag'd; it imposes Silence on Malice it self, and compells em to bless his Majesty's Choice of such a Pillar of the State, such a Patron of Vertue.
Long may your Lordship live to remain in this most Ho∣nourable Station, that his Majesty may be serv'd with an entire Fidelity, and the Nation be render'd perfectly Happy. Since from such Heads and Hearts, the Monarch reaps his Glory, and the Kingdom receives its Safety and Tranquility. This is the unfeign'd Prayer of
My Lord,
