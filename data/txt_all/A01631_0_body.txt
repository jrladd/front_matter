YOur very courteous af∣fabilitie, whereof I haue had so great experience, continuing without any shew of a mutable mind hath greatelye moued myne affection to make no small account of your worships frend∣ship. And I would to God that it were in me by any meanes to make any small a∣mendes vnto you for the same. Which to do is easier for me to wish than to accom∣plishe. Wherefore as there is no remedie but that I must remayne endebted: so on the contrary parte to shew no signes of a willing minde, were nothing els but a ma∣nifest tokē of an ingrateful person. Where∣vpon hauing perused certaine of the com∣mon places contained in the Methode of Hyperius and lighting vpon these two here specified, and thinking them not vnmeete
to be reuealed for the instruction of the people: I purposed for declaration of my louing mind toward you to put them forth in print dedicated vnto your worship. Vn∣to whome I know they shall be no lesse ac∣ceptable then if they were thinges of very great account. Thus committing you and your affaires to the protection of the hi∣ghest; I bid you farewell.
