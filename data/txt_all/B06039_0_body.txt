My Lord;
HAD I been affected with that itching Humour of Ambition, to raise an Obelisk to my Memory, and to leave behind me some tokens, that I have had a Being and Existence upon Earth, I could have experienced no easier method, or more advantagious Arti∣fice to gain an immortality upon Earth, than by fixing your Lordships Name, to these my poor and weak endeavours: But I am so perfectly sensible of my own Youth and unwor∣thiness, that far be it from me, (let others reflect with what eye they please) to make any such thought, the occasion of this Address; though I have two urgent Motives, which in∣duce me to implore your Patronage and Protection.
Not to speak, my Lord, (lest I affront the Modesty so innate to your Temper, or come within the sphear of flattery so contrary to my Genius) of your generous compassion and mighty condescention to all of the Ministerial Function, which would have been too copious a Theam for my small E∣loquence and Rhetorick to pitch upon, I shall acquaint your Lordship with the Reasons of this my Humble Dedica∣tion.

First, To congratulate the Honours our most Gracious So∣veraign hath so worthily, as well as freely conferred upon your Lordship: More especially, in that having so plentiful a choice of worthy Gentry in this County, He hath selected you to lead the Van in that Honourable Office wherewith you are intrusted.
The Conduct and management of which, I shall spare to tell the World, because Fame hath already every-where pro∣claimed your prudent setling, and (which is highly consider∣able) your great augmenting the Militia. Go on then, my Lord, to perform as worthily as you have begun, that your Lordship may be for ever famous over England, for your Services to God, the King, and his Country; and at last live eternally with that Glorious Militia of Heaven, who continually attend about the Majestick Throne of the Lord of Hosts.
The other Reason of the Dedication, my Lord, is because it hath been the Lot of the later of these Discourses (as well as its Author, who blesseth God for it) to pass through good report and bad report; it hath been accus'd of False Do∣ctrine, because I somewhat glaunced at Election and Reproba∣tion, though my Friends judged so candidly of it, that after many denyals, their importunity hath wrought so effectually with me, that I am willing it should appear in the World (in that same impolite and unlick'd form it was delivered in) either to clear or to condemn me: If there be any thing dis∣cordant to Scripture, or Reason, I free every Reader from from endeavouring to justifie me.
But if they be angry with me because I have told them the truth of the Faith once delivered to the Saints, and daily contended for by the Orthodox Divines of of the Church of England; let Geneva account it my fault, I'll ever esteem it my duty and my Glory.

For a former Experience hath fully convinc'd me, my Lord, that the loyalty of a Sermon is more offensive than the Superstition, and Popery thereof; If we deny the Le∣gality of the Scotch Covenant, and will not comply with the Principles of Levellers, but preach Subjection to the King and his Government, what do they imagine it less than a Crime unpardonable? If we stand up in defence of the Catholick Faith establish'd in our Kingdom, and are earn∣est to maintain a Conformity to the Rites and Ceremonies of the same; They presently cry out the Romans will come, and take away their place and Nation.
But alas! poor mistaken Souls how are they deceived? When as the speediest Voyage to the Court of Rome is by Say∣ling the way of Amsterdam; For I am bold to Challenge a∣ny man of reason, to shew me a more Compendious way to e∣rect a Papal Jurisdiction amongst us than by the destruction of the Religion of Edward the Sixth, and confirmed unto us by Charles the Second.
For a strict maintaining the Doctrine and Discipline of our Church, is the only Armour to withstand the Policies of the Papal Interest. For nothing can endanger our Re∣ligion from abroad so much as our Contentions at home, whilst we seperate our selves from our Churches, and are crumbled into little Sects and Parties. We give too great advantages and opportunity for a Common Enemy to break in upon us, which the Romanists are so quick-sighted to espy, that it is upon this account they send their little Agents a∣mong us, who make it their sole business slily to insinuate themselves, and creep into the bosoms and humours of our People, encouraging and fomenting all publick differences, pursuant to that secret End, on which they are sent on Em∣bassy.
Now that your Lordship may be more particularly satis∣fied in the verity of this confident Assertion; I humbly de∣sire
your Lordship, at your greatest conveniency, to consult the History of Henry the Fourth King of France, written by the Bishop of Rhodes; and also that of the Spanish Mo∣naachy, whose Author is Campanella: In both which I have observed, that after a large Discourse of the intended Invasions of those two Potent and Mighty Princes on the Kingdom of Great Britain, being incited thereunto by the forcible perswasions and commands of Rome, as much as pricked forward by their own Ambition: They especially de∣clare their Judgements of the Means and Instruments to be applyed for the Ruine and utter Subversion of the Church of England in this manner; That there was no better Artifice, than by causing Divisions and Dissentions amongst the Eng∣lish, and by a continual encouraging and fostering the same; and that it was no easie Province to eradicate and overthrow their Religion, unless by the Foundation of some certain Schools or Academies in Flanders, that the Students there∣of may disseminate and scatter abroad Seeds for Divisions in Natural and Theological Sciences, which would disorder and discompose their Opinions, and unhinge and unsettle their Judgements: For, say they, the English are of a temper and constitution much tending to Novelties, and incli∣ning to changes, and therefore the Effects of such a Contrivance will be very considerable.
Now I leave it to your Lordship's better Judgement and Experience, whether this hath been put in practice or not, and whether the Zealous Brethren of England be not indu∣strious to forge Gives and Fetters to shackle themselves with∣al; whereas, poor deluded Souls! they might see, if they pleas'd, they are the Agents imployed by Rome to defeat and destroy the Religion of Christ, and to promote the Errors of Antichrist: For what can be a more Popular Argument to use for the seduction of soft-minded and weakly-principled Protestants, and to draw them off from us, than to extol
and magnifie the perfect unity of their Church, and to la∣ment and pity the sad distractions and divisions of ours. For though men of reading and consideration can easily disprove them, and prove it a Church by far less at unity then our own; yet still this Argument may be forcible with them, who have not leisure and opportunity to come to know so much of them, but they daily observe men endeavouring to rend our Church in pieces, and cut it into little bits and mam∣mocks.
Nevertheless I will not flatter my self, that those who believe nothing but what themselves speak or own, will con∣sent to the Doctrine of this TRUTH. to wit, That they who pretend an inbred aversion to Popery, and exclaim most a∣gainst Rome, are most instrumental in procuring our Sla∣very unto that see; For they are generally so wedded to their Erroneous Opinions, that none can behold the beauty and glory of an Object, but those who borrow their Eyes to con∣template withal: Nay, had I not begg'd your Lordships Pro∣tection (for who dare avow if a Person so honourable will be pleas'd to countenance) I could have expected no better than my usual Entertainment, the worst of their spleen and ma∣lice: For if we will not stile Humour, Conscience; and No∣velty, Religion; if we have not the precise Cut, and walk in their Exact Geometrical Saintship or form of Godliness, they presently conclude us scandalous and ungodly: But let our Opinions and Judgements concentre with their Dicta∣mens, and then the Wind is presently turn'd; for they will judge more candidly of our actions, by blaming the infirmity of the Flesh, and weakness of humane Nature for Actions of shame and debauchery; because the construction of our Deeds must differ equally with those of our Principles: Nay further, they will wrest them (with the same Licence they mis-interpret the Scriptures) to make them speak according to their Sense and Opinion. From such Persons I fore∣tell
an indifferent usage, unless your Lordship favour, what otherwise they will certainly disaffect, which (after your Lordships Pardon for the dedication of these Discourses so unworthy your Patronage) is the Humble Request of
