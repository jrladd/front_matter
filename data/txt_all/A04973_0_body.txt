REading of late (my Lord) a Chapter of Esdras, folding vp in a misticall and darke discours, a liuing represen∣tation of a long time, wher∣of the most is past, and soe little to come: I thought it no lost labour to take my pen and vnfolde the same: that ther∣n we may beholde (which naturally all de∣sire to see) as well the issues of thinges to come, as what is past, or is in being: and ther∣after to qualifie and moderate our hopes, and call our troubled thoughts (which otherwise runne with raines on neck) within the cir∣cle and lmitation, bounded and drawen from aboue. And finding this prophesie written by a man greatlye beloued of God, and therto (which rare is) a Princes fauourite, high in grace with a King of Persia: I presumed the rather to commend my labour to your hono∣rable L. as vpon whome God hath vouchsa∣fed
 like great and rare graces. Suffiseth that your. Honor reade it, greater fauor Esdras seekes not. He labors not to praise, or please, which now a daies findes many frends, but to admonish and forewarne, which fataly findes none til be to late. He feares not the learned and noble reprouer of supposed Predictions, for he hath heard him honor the Prophesies of Holy writ, wherin him-selfe hath no lesse ho∣nor gotten, then giuen. His other enemies, hath wild me to conceal, and to reserne them to a more open hearing. But Esdras is at the next leafe (my Lord) and craues your Honors pa∣tience for an hower.
