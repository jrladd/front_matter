Honoured Sir,
BE pleased to accept the Patro∣nage
of these few Sheets;
which as they contain a Trea∣tise
of Arms, &c. can no where more
securely shelter themselves than under
the Banner of Your Protection: For
being cherished by Your Allowance, the
World may well imagine that there is
something more than ordinary compre∣hended
in them which may merit a seri∣ous
Reading and a generous Practice;
especially at such a time, as this, for
Warlike Preparation.

I must confess the Trust You have, de∣serves
far Nobler Presents of this na∣ture
than what here I make. Nor am
I ignorant how far my Presumption
has carry'd me in this attempt. In ex∣cuse
whereof, I have onely, with Your
kind Permission to plead the Encou∣ragment
of Your continual Favours,
and Advantagions Obligations to a
Young Beginner; of which should I
be once ingratefully forgetful, when
the least Mite of Opportunity offers, I
should incur a crime that would de∣prive
me of one of the chiefest happi∣nesses
whereto I aspire; which is to
acknowledge my self Sir
