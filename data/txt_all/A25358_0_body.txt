Most Dread Soveraign,
AMongst the multitude of Sa∣crifices which daily offer themselves to your Sacred Majesty, of the richer sort, if this mean Oblation of a Turtle find your Royal Aspect, speaks only the Grandeur and Heroick Greatness of England's Monarch, who darts the diffusive beams of your Goodness (throughout your Realms) on your Liege People by your auspicious and most gen∣tle Government, being cherish'd by the
 gracious Rays of Soveraign Power, as the obscure parts of the Earth are by the radiations of the Sun. These happy In∣fluences (like the Dew of Hermon) descend upon all that are not guilty of Disloyalty, and trample not on Regal Power in abstracting their Allegiance; for such are no longer Subjects, but Re∣bels, that despise Dominions, and speak evil of Dignities, contemning the bright and splendid Crown of Soveraignty. Sa∣cred and Divine is Royal Majesty, as it is a reflection of that above, and it is the Glory thereof to protect things Sa∣cred; therefore it looks so high, and pre∣fixes so mighty a Name, which can give a sufficient value to things in themselves both mean and worthless, however im∣perfect, your favour is able to supply, and give it life, if the production be not unworthy you Royal Patronage: yet it is not improper to lay it at the feet of Majesty, because the Holy Trinity, that Theological Mystery, is the Article
 of our Creed, and it can't take a more rever'd Sanctuary for its safety than the Defender of the Faith, whose prudent and Princely Conduct crowns all our Fe∣licities with a calm Tranquillity in Church and State; therefore let us serve the Lord our God and Charles our King, whom he hath raised up unto us. Long, long may you flourish with a Crown of Glory on your head, and a Sce∣pter of Triumph in your hand, bathing your feet in the blood of your Enemies, and live to be, as you are, the delight and glory of your People, and we trust under your shadow, being not only to Moses a Protection, but to all the Tribe of Levi that wait at the Altar; and the great Argosie, the Ship Royal of the Church, would have dash'd a∣gainst the rocks, and been swallowed up by the quick Sands, or by the malignity of cross and contrary Winds (of a pre∣tended Religious Crew who delight in Blood and Treason) unless your Sacred
 Majesty, who as a Guardian Angel, that sits at the Stern, by some propitious gales from Heaven, had guided and conducted her to the fair Havens of Peace. As Protection, so it humbly craves Acce∣ptance, because goodness is the honour of Greatness, and that Persian Mo∣narch was not more famous for accepting a little water from the hand of a loving Subject, than your Sacred Majesty is re∣nown'd through Britain's Orb for your gracious Clemency to all, and particu∣larly to the Offerings of the Sons of Aaron, though this Piece blushes at the confidence of its Dedication, as not worthy the approach of Royal Presence, or Majesty's judicious Eye, being like the straw and brick of Egypt, very inconsiderable in regard of the polishing, carving and Cedar-work of the Temple, performed by a Bezaleel and Aholiab, that can curiously work in Gold; yet I contribute my Mite, and cast my little into the Treasury, but with such humi∣lity
 presented as speaks Loyalty, and not presumption, shewing the World in all expressions of a grateful mind, and ema∣nations of the greatest affection, where Duty binds me to pay the Fealty and Homage of my Obedience: Celebrating the Memory of this DayMay 29. with ebulli∣tions of Joy and Satisfaction, as it car∣ries the propitious Star of Royal Birth, with a Constellation of Blessings to the Kingdom in a happy and peaceable Re∣stauration. Almighty Goodness setled us on our old Basis, and by a Miracle of Providence restored to us our Prince, Religion and Government, for which Mercy we magnifie the Glorious and Eternal Trinity, humbly beseeching the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to conti∣nue to your Regal Majesty a long and prosperous Reign over us, with an af∣fluence of Health and Wealth, Triumphs and Conquests here; and when you shall put off the Glories of a Temporal Sove∣raignty, and lay down your mortal Dia∣dem,
 you may exchange it for an im∣mortal Crown eternal in the Heavens, being incircled with the Rays of Glory and Happiness in a Life that never pays Tribute to Death. So prays
