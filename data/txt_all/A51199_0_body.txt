MY LORD,
THough all men that know me are
sufficiently enform'd of the ma∣ny
and great obligtion your
Lordship has layd upon me,
and that as many of them as I
have discours'd withal upon
that subject, are able, if they
will do me right, to bear witness
with what candor and acknowledgment, not perhaps
without something of ostentation, I have ever own'd
and extol'd them; yet (my Lord) those men are so
few, and the beforementioned obligations of so gene∣rous
a nature, that I confess I have a desire both to
be more universally known your servant, and that the
world at the same time should take notice, that
though you may in my person have plac'd your fa∣vours
upon an unworthy, yet that they have never∣theless
been conferr'd upon a grateful man. Such a
one (my Lord) I profess my self to be, and having no
other way to manifest that I am so, have taken the li∣berty
to dedicate this Translation of mine to your Lord∣ships
diversion and acceptance, not suspecting that
you who have honour'd me so many other ways should
discountenance me in this, but rather protect me from

others, as well as excuse me to your self; and in
truth (my Lord) I am so much your own, that you
may justifiably enough be a little partial in my fa∣vour.
My Lord, it may perhaps be expected by those
who know your Lordship for the noble person you are,
that I should here salute you with a finer Epistle
than peradventure I can write, or at least than this
is either likely, or in truth intended to be; not that I
would not present you with the best I have, but know∣ing
your Lordship aversion to such impertinencies
as men sometimes stuff their Dedications withall, I
should not only willfully offend you, but moreover step
out of my own design, which is very clear from the
vanity of thinking to advance your Honor or Name
by any testimony of mine, and only intended with all
submission to declare my self,
MY LORD,
