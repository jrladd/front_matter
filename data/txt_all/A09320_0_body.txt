RIGHT HO:) (RIGHT WOR:
YOur ready condescending at my request to grace my Person with your
 ioynt testimonie together, maketh me now thus bold to craue your fa∣uour and acceptance together to countenance this my labour.
That which here I offer to your view is first the face of the seuen∣fold estate of Christs Church, typed out in the seuen Churches of Asia, vnder the title of the seuen golden Candlestickes. In this you may behold what is alreadie past, what things are now in present being (in which the Papists make themselues merrie; but it is their Cygnea cantio, before their day of mourning) and what the e∣state hereafter shall be, which wee are to exspect and looke for in the appointed time. In the second place, is added Englands Honour, wherein is shewed how highly, and that many wayes God hath aduan∣ced this noble Nation, to incourage
 vs still in his seruice against that Antichristion power, and Heathe∣nish Superstition. In the third place, is prooued that great My∣sterie of the saluation of that an∣cient people of God, much hindered by that Romish Religion. In conclu∣sion, is an aduice to Peace and Vni∣tie at home, that wee may bend our strength against our Enemies a∣broad.
I humbly craue pardon, if here∣in I haue bin ouer-bold to present your Honours, and other so worthy Personages, with such small Trea∣tises. I know them little in shew, but not so in substance. The Church is the Spouse of Christ, the verie Queene of Heauen, heere shee is liuely painted out. The glory of our Kingdome is our Crowne, and peace with loue the bond of perfection; the taste of these things, I hope,
 shall not bee vnacceptable, neyther the good will of him that offereth the same, for no other end verily, but to leaue a testimonie to the World of his humble seruice, and of his duty in all thankfulnesse, who doth and euer will ac∣knowledge himselfe,
Batcombe, March. 10.
