SIR, though without suspition of flatterie I might in more
ample and freer tearmes, intymate my affection vnto you,
yet hauing so sensible a tast of your generous and noble disâˆ£position,
which without this habit of ceremony can estimate
my loue: I will rather affect breuitie, though it shoulde seeme
my fault, then by my tedious complement, to trouble mine owne
opinion setled in your iudgement and discretion. I make you the
Patron of this Epistle of the Black-Prince, which I pray you
accept, till more easier howers may offer vp from me some thing
more worthy of your view, and my trauell.
