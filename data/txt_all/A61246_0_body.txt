Sir,
I Humbly Present you with a Sermon, which when it was preach'd, met with such a favourable reception and kind entertainment from some of the Loyal and Judici∣ous Auditors, that they look'd upon the Printing it to be of public Ʋse and Advantage, because it might (as they thought) in some measure at least contribute to the Redu∣ction of such of His Majesty's Subjects as have been misled into seditious Practices, and prevent others from falling into the snares of the same accursed Seduction; and accor∣dingly they importun'd me to make it as Publick as now it appears. And tho' I took some time to consider before I would yield to their Requests, yet when I had once resolved to comply with them, I found no place for Deliberation to whom I should Dedicate it, or whose Name I should bor∣row to give countenance and protection to it. For the De∣sign of this Sermon, being to promote an holy Fear of God, and a loyal Fear of the King, no Person did, or indeed could occur to my thoughts, whose Patronage could be more proper
 or useful to a Discourse of this nature, than your own; be∣cause You, Sir, are so great an Example of those two necessa∣ry and indispensible Duties which are here recommended. Your holy fear of God has been made visible to all who know you, in your constant unalterable Perseverance in the Com∣munion of the Reformed Church of England, and in your zealous Concernment, which upon all just Occasions you express, for its true Interests, and unalienable Privileges, notwithstanding all the Temptations you may have met with either at Home or Abroad, to corrupt your holy Faith and misguide your devout Affections. Your loyal fear of the King has been as evident as the former throughout the whole course of your Conversation, and most vigorously exerted and discover'd it self in sutable Effects and a Loyal Beha∣viour under the most frightful Posture, and discouraging Circumstances of public Affairs, when some were driven from their Duty and Allegiance by dismal Stories, and factious Amusements, and others were wheadl'd out of it by popular Addresses, and smooth and crafty Insinuations. And therefore, you justly enjoy not only the Estate and Ho∣nourable Titles which belong'd to your Ancestors, but also all that public Esteem and Reputation with your Prince and Country, which their fam'd and celebrated Loyalty procur'd for them. I need go no higher for a Proof of this than to your immediat Progenitor and Honourable Father Sir HENRY SLINGSBY, who persever'd in his Allegiance to his Prince, to such a degree of Faithfulness, as made him Resist even unto Bloud (not in a Fanatical but Christian sence) and
 lay down his Life for his Natural tho' banished Soveraign, whom no Terrours or Allurements of a remorseless and craf∣ty Ʋsurper could oblige him to renounce. So that Loyalty seems entail'd upon your Family, and looks as if it were your Inheritance as well as your Choice, convey'd in your Bloud as well as infus'd at your Baptism, and descended upon you by your natural as well as spiritual Birth. But however, it is impossible that you should ever depart from your self or your Duty, while you live in the Communion of the Church of England, and make her Rules the Measures of your Subjection; for she teacheth a perfect, absolute, unlimi∣ted Subjection, by teaching all her Members to Obey all the just and lawful Commands of their King, and with pa∣tience and resignation to suffer his Censures and Punish∣ments, where they cannot obey. And I do not doubt, but one great Reason among all the rest, why you value and live in the Church of England rather than in any other Christi∣an Society whatsover, is because her Doctrine and Pra∣ctices, in point of civil Subjection, are so conformable to those of our Blessed Saviour, and his holy Apostles, who died rather than they would resist those Soveraign Powers they liv'd under, and who have forbidden all Resistance un∣der the pain of eternal Damnation. And may you long live in the Communion of this Holy Church, to do Honour to God, and Service to your Prince upon Earth; and God out of his infinit Mercy in his due time receive you into the Church Tri∣umphant in Heaven. This is and shall be the constant daily Prayer of
SIR,
