WIthout Raine the Plant withereth, and without encouragement Learn∣ing fainteth: a benefit bestowed deserues thankfulnesse: and your Honors fauour enforceth my acknowledgement of the great comfort receiued by you in my godly studies. Wherefore I can∣not but sort your Vertues with the Honourable, and your Praise with the Worthies. And although the Sea hath no neede of the small Ri∣uers, yet doe they runne into it;
nor the Moone of the Stars, yet doe they rise with it: so the fulnesse of your Honors wisedome needes no view of my meane and simple stu∣dies; nor the light of your knowledge the pervsing of my slender and vn∣learned Labors, yet am I bold to present them vnto your Honour, who in aboundance of meekenesse did neuer repel the industrious, nor disdaine the simple, (as I by experi∣ence haue formerly found by your good acceptance, and doe still hope of your Honorable continuance.) At this time therefore I doe Dedi∣cate vnto your Honor, the Afflicted mans Vow, made in his perplexity & penitencie, (he lately beholding Adams Tragedy,) wherin he percei∣ued Adams sin as a heauy stone fal∣ling vpon him, and all Man-kinde, ready to bruise and to grinde him
to pouder, had not Christ in mercy put vnder his hand for his great and most happy preseruation. Where∣fore your Honor shall finde this af∣flicted man now meditating, pray∣ing, and praising God, wishing ear∣nestly (if it were possible) while he li∣ued in this world, that the thoughts of his hart might be alwaies cleane, the words of his mouth euer holy, the workes of his hands euer iust, & the wayes of his feete euer plaine: that in the end he might with God rest in peace, and be glorified with him in heauen. To the which place and glory, I beseech the Almightie to bring you and your noble Poste∣ritie, to your euerlasting and hope∣full ioyes without end. Amen.
