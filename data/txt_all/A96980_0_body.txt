Reverend Sirs,
I Am your Tenant, even almost under the Droppings of your House▪ and although unknown to many of you, yet ready to Serve the meanest of you, in any thing in my Power; having but a small Portion of what you have attained to. Nevertheless, my Experience as to length of Time is Double, (I do believe to the Oldest of you) being above Eighty One Years of Age: Having seen more Changes and Revolutions in the World, then you have done; which caused me to search what has been done before my Time; and also to consider, what Ground we have in the Holy Scriptures; to know and believe what may be expected for the time to come: and though it be too late for me to think, to attain to such advantages, as the meanest of you Excel me in; yet if he that had but one Talent, had Improved it, he had not been Rejected by his Lord; Matthew 25. 15. And as Peter said to the Lame-Man Acts 3, Silver and Gold have I none, but such as he had, he freely gave him. So I say, Tongues, Languages, Arts, Sciences, Rhetorick, and Eloquence I have none; but such as I have I humbly present unto you; and although there is nothing herein, but what you may easily find out by Searching as I have done; yet by the method I have taken, it may be Serviceable in sparing some Labour, in the ready finding out of every thing, or Prooff therein mentioned at the very first sight. which if Accepted and Approved of by You, may In∣courage him further to proceed. Who is
Reverend Sirs
