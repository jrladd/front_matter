Christian Reader,
IT would be an indecorum, as custom now ob∣taineth, to send abroad a discourse, without direction where it may seek its entertainment: whether this be to be imputed to the great unkind∣ness of Readers, or to the unreasonable multitude of Writers, it concerns me very little to enquire, and thee as little to know. To them I send it, who I hope intended honestly, when they desired this plain discourse might be publish'd; and though perhaps it might be weakness in me to let your desires have this effect on me, yet it is no fault to wish it may, and to hope it will do thee good. It was a plain discourse in my mouth, and it was needful it should be so; and it is plain now in paper and Ink, because I was desir'd to publish what I preach'd: if it be somewhat more concise, it is not without reason (somewhat being proper enough to the Hearers, which might be less proper to Readers, who knew not those circumstances the Hearers were acquainted with). And you need quarrel the brevity of it no sooner than you find you were at
the end of it before you were willing. I am sure I had an excellent pattern of fidelity and diligence in Gods Family, when I had his life in my eye, whose death was occasion of this discourse; I will not praeoccupate your Judgment, whether I have well commended the Duty to you, or encouraged you to the performance of it. I pray of you a serious and heedful Reading: and I pray to God that he would give you such a heart as he requireth, such a life of holy care to save your selves and others, that God may give you the blessedness of faithful Ser∣vants in life, at death, to eternity. That this may contribute to all these, prayeth,

April 20. 1677.
