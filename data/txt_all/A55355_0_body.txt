May it please your Grace,
IF a Present so mean as this Book,  worth
a Dispute of Title, none could ptend to
so good a one, as YOUR GRAE. The
Subject, and Character of the Person, ar suitable
in some, though a much inferiour degree, to that
Generous Gallantry and Exemplary Courage,
by which you have attracted the Esteem and
Admiration of all Mankind; and so Eminently
and Early signaliz'd your self; as not only to
Answer, but Exceed what the World expected
from a Person so descended. For it is an Honour
peculiar to YOUR GRACE, that as No Man
ever received more Lustre from Noble Ancestors,
so None ever reflected it back again upon them,
with greater Advantage.
But that, MY LORD, which gives YOU an
Inherent Right to these Memoirs, is, that they
were put into our own Language, by the parti∣cular
Choice, and Recommendation of Your Il∣lustrious
Grandfather; And therefore the Heir
of His Honours and His Virtues may so justly
challenge this Address, that it were a Rudeness
at least, if not a Robbery, to appropriate it to
any other Person. The Sieur de Pontis therefore

for himself, and I for the Translator (my de∣ceased
Father) beg leave to plead Succession and
Descent. And I am very sensible, that ater the
Approbation of one such great Person already,
there remains no farther possible Addition o Ho∣nour
to these Writings, but only to have that
Judgment confirm'd, by YOUR GRACES Ac∣ceptance
and Protection.
These Considerations, My LORD, give me
the Confidence to hope, that YOUR GRACE will
pardon a Man, who presumes to lay at Your
Feet, what is upon so many accounts your own;
and who, in so doing, is proud to tell the
World, that he is
My LORD,
