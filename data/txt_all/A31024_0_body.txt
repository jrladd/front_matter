Gentlemen,
I Must beg your justification of this pedant and Common-place Apology, wherewith I am oblig'd to Preface my self to the Reader, viz. that you not only earnestly requested, but even forc'd a pro∣mise from me of putting this discourse in Print, which I mention not so much in acknowledgment of that un∣deserved respect you were pleas'd to shew me, (al∣though I should be the worst of men not to own so great an obligation) nor to beg your protection against the malice and calumnies of the many inveterate Factions, (for I know 'tis more than you can do for your selves.) But to declare the aversion I have ever

had to appear in this kind, with the loss of that freedom I have formerly taken in censuring other mens too great forwardness herein? for I ever commiserated the poor burthen'd Press, and amongst Friends, fre∣quently reflected upon our many self-admiring Authors, with those little tricks and Artifices, which of my knowledge are used to get abroad by publick order, or especial command; Besides, as I was engag'd to serve Mr. High-Sheriff in this way of my profession (as you Sir can testify) before this last Hellish Conspiracy was discoverd, so would I not be thought to have the more freely expressd my self upon the Discovery, for I bless God, I never believd better of the Party, than they have now approv'd themselves, and there∣fore left to my own choice, should think it too late to express my resentments, when by the infinite mercy of Heaven they are as despicable as they were sometimes dangerous: But since I am thus put upon unbosoming my thoughts, give me leave further to declare a su∣spicion, that our prudential Politicians with their Trimming Moderation (who now indeed cry pec∣cavi with a non putaram, truly, I could not have thought that any English Spirit had been of such a temper) are Hypocrites rather than Fools, and I am still afraid that many who now kiss the hand, wish'd well to the enterprise in their hearts, and despair not

of a better opportunity to cut the throat, whilst that malicious monkish wit upon the great Erasmus hang∣ing between Heaven and Hell, may be apply'd to many of our Wise Discreet Men, who take care to keep themselves equally pois'd between Monarchy and Commonwealth; Had the Design indeed newly drop'd out of the Clouds, from the Prince of the Air, or been some antiquated project of Machiavel or Bor∣gia, a sober well meaning intention might have been impos'd upon by those many fair Glosses which are never wanting upon such occasions, but when 'tis one continued Scene of villany carry'd on for Forty (I may say for Fourscore) years together, and now begun to be acted over again by many of the same persons, all upon the same principles; nay, so dull is their invention, by the same method too, by the same improbable Stories, false suggestions, and most scan∣dalous reproaches upon all men that stand up for Peace and Truth, Religion or Loyalty; How can any man of sence debauch his Reason or Charity so far, as to believe that such Vipers have all on a suddain lost their Stings, or that they will not naturally pro∣duce a Generation of the same kind? especially when we find them equally impenitent for the mischiefs they have formerly done, and partial in their present Judgment and representation of things; Thus the

5th. of November was a Hellish Bloody Plot, but the 30th. of January's Parricide must not be call'd to remembrance; the Court must be arraign'd of Arbitrary Designs, but not one single Member suspected of Commonwealthism; and therefore whilst our Demagogues were in being to defend the establish'd Church was nothing less than Popery; and to compare Eighty with Forty One, the direct way into T—ms Inquisition, as if no man living could remember the Arbitrary arrogance of a Re∣publican Junto with our twenty years Captivity under a Rebel Sword: or to speak of our Religious concerns, as if Ignatius Loyola and John Cal∣vin had not both set up about the same time, or our poor Church and Nation suffer'd as much from the Presbyterians as Jesuits.
But in this Gentlemen, as well as in the follow∣ing discourse, I present you with nothing but your own thoughts, which as they are much better express'd in your Loyal Address to His Majesty, so do you still more effectually declare them in a continued stea∣dy vigour for His Service and Preservation.E. of Cra∣ven. And as there is one Great GoodMan to whose Bounty and Favour, I must, (under God) solely attribute what∣ever relates to my well being in this life, so I esteem

it no mean part of my happiness that He and Provi∣dence hath fix'd me amongst a company of worthy Per∣sons, who will set a value upon a man, though be hath nothing more to recommend him than an unfeign∣ed Zeal for the Church and State, King and Government, but so good a Principle will buoy up any ordinary parts, and alone enable its votaries to laugh at, and defie, the froppishness and falshood of a gain-saying disobedient People, whom I should not despair shortly to see of another temper; had you Gentlemen the same influence upon our little Commonwealth Corporations, as you have upon the out-lying Factions: But since it is the will of Hea∣ven that these Canaanites should be continued in the Land, doubtless it will now on all hands be thought requisite to have such an eye upon them, that it may not be in their power to quench the light of our Israel, or disturb the Peace of Sion.
And if by this means we can at last be throughly awakened into a sence of danger, it will be such light out of darkness, such an unexpected good from so Hellish an intended Evil, as those malevolent Spirits whom the disappointments cannot convert, the envy must necessarily confound, whilst our repeated deliverances having wearied the malice of their

attempts, we may by Gods blessing, arrive in the end at that happy settlement, which you, and all good men endeavour, and that your endeavours may fully take effect, (amongst many thousand others, more worthy to prevail) shall never want the in∣cessant Prayers of
Honoured Sirs,
