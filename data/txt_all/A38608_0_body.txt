Right Honorable Lords,
HE that presenteth this Piece, is a stranger unto you:
but certainly these Do∣ctrines are not strangers; for they are the same which you professe and protect. I have taken unto me the boldnesse to cause them to appear under the splendour of your Name. I believed that I ought so to do; forasmuch as they have already appeared in an Auditory which some of this august Senate have honoured with their pre∣sence; forasmuch also as they have been hatched
under the wing of the Thrice-illustrious Earl of Pembrook, one of the stars of your Firmament: & final∣ly, forasmuch as the envie of mine enemies having brought their calumniati∣on even to the feet of your supreme Tribunal some yeers since, you permit∣ted me to plead mine own cause and the bright lustre of your Justice dissipated those Phantasms wch enfor∣ced themselves to annihi∣late that Ministery which
hath pleased God to im∣pose upon me. Be plea∣sed, my Lords, that the Truth and my self render this testimony of our Gra∣titude to the Justice, Wis∣dom and Piety which ani∣mateth the Body of your so renowned Assembly; the which may it please the most High eternally to co∣ver under the shadow of his Protection.
