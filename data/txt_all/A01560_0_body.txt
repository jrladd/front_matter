My Honourable good Lord,
I THVS (as I am bound) bethink me. Whose ought
 Mine to be, but whose I am my selfe? To accept the Parent, is (I presume) not to refuse the Brood. It is but my Duty, to beget any thing to your seruice: and shall bee your Goodnesse, to vouchsafe it enter∣tainment. I must confesse, it had bin better, this win∣dy
 Egge should haue beene pasht in the Shell; than been hatcht vnder your Lordships Wings. It is a common Fault; and some beside me, bewaile I toge∣ther with me: Ah that such our worthlesse Brats, so wontedly creep into so honourable Bosomes! What
 ouer-insolence is it of ours; that we dare to shroud vs there, where wee ought rather feare to bee detected? This is more than Boldnesse, that I presume now a Patron for my Worke: It shall be but Duty, that I endeuour once a Worke for my Patron. What
 haue I here set before you; but what your selfe (before me) haue not onely noted, but hated also; Mens Vanities, and Euils? Oh pardon, that I pre∣sent your Lord∣ship with what you like not to behold: I shall so be tied to make amends with what
 (I know) you loue to embrace.
To Praise you (as they vse) for your Pietie, Gra∣uitie, Bountie, Clemencie; would be thought to flat∣ter you: To haue named you is (in all these) to haue praised you. Yet will I (maugre all such their imputa∣tion, or exception)
 pray for you. May your Lordship liue long dayes, and good: yea, ha∣uing now attained to a good age; let it yet be added to your dayes. May your iustest Ho∣nour (maugre the mutability of these rolling Globes, & Times) neuer be destitute of Conti∣nuance with En∣largement.
 May you lastly, for Ho∣nour terrestriall, and fading; enioy an Happinesse ce∣lestiall, and with eternity. So praies, and vowes
