Great SIR,
PRovidence the
wise disposer of
us all, sending
me abroad to seeke bread

in a strange land, gave
me the good fortune to
be a spectator of some of
the Heroick Actions of
your Royall Highnesse,
not only at the takeing
of Narden, and the Grave
from the French, but at
severall other places; I
have been also happy in
liveing long in the Hague
where for severall yeares
I had the opportunitie of
observeing, (or rather
Admiring) your High∣nesse
wise direction and
Government in the seve∣rall▪
Colledges of the

States, where some times
your Highnesse hath been
pleased to Act the part
of the Pensionarie during
his Indisposition; But
why doe I speake of these
things? All the world
knowes that your Highnes
hath wrestelled with and
overcome the greatest
Difficulties Imaginable,
not feareing the frownes
and unjust proceedings
of some, who by force of
Armes detaine part of
your Highnesses sovera∣nity
and inheritance, nor
could the large Proffers

and Advantages offered
to you by some, at any
time shake that sted∣fastnes
and Princely re∣solution
your Highnesse
ever had to stand by
and dye for the Intrest
of the Common-wealth;
No God hath certainely
chosen your Highnesse
to be a Moises to goe
in and out before his
People, and to be a glory
to the Royall Familie of
the Stewards. And now
great Sir I want words
to beg your Highnes
pardon for the high pre∣sumption

of Dedicating
this small piece to your
Highnes. All I can say is
that it would be an infi∣nite
joy to me if I could
possiblie doe any thing
to engage your Highnesse
to look upon and ac∣cept
of these Remarks,
as comming in all sub∣mission,
from him who
shall never cease to im∣plore
the Throne of
Grace to preserve your
Highnesse to be the most
eminent Instrument in
his own hand, for the
good of Church and

Common-wealth; so
prayes,
