THe proofe of your worships good∣will, hath made me presume to present these my paines vnder your fauourable pro∣tection: not doubting, but as your worship is zealous in Religion, conformable in li∣uing, and a supporter of godly enterprises, so you will become a Patron to any good pro∣ceedings. Thus beeing lothe to trouble your patience with any prolixius or tedious dis∣course not omitting my humble duetie, I commit your worship to the tuition of the Almightie.
