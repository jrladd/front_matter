Dearly Beloved,
I Present you these first-fruits of my poor labours, as a pledge of my love, and testimony of my unfeigned desires, and longings after your settlement, and com∣fort together. I am indeared to you in the bowels of Christ, and for his sake ow my self unto you: My highest ambition in this world is, to see you stablished in truth, and flourishing in the glorious graces of the Gospel. I have treated on these two subjects, because I know they are the tempting errours of these Times, and have the fairest glosses set on them, and have too much influence to disturb the Peace and Order of Churches: The first especially,
 which eats out mens affections, and creeps at the heart like a gangrene insensibly; an opinion which hath been always ominous, and of a won∣derful strange influence, accompanied with the most dangerous retinue of errours, since the first Embrio of it was brought forth; whether by a judgement of God, or from its natural and se∣cret connexion with other principles of dark∣ness, I will not determine; only God hath shew∣ed some black characters on it in every Nation where it hath prevailed; though we cannot but say, many Saints are innocently under the power of it.
For the second, I hope when mens hearts come in Tune, their voyces will likewise: The former denies more Fundamental Principles, as the Co∣venant in its extent, and subjects; the freeness of Grace; the riches of its workings in the New Testament; and contracts the Gospel; leaving more Grace visible in the Legal and Old Testa∣ment dispensation, then in the New.
I have only summed up what others express more at large, with something new, and never yet touched, that I know of: And as to the me∣thod,
 all is new, and made fit for your use, if Christ set it home on you. I have nothing else to add, but to tell you, you have been yet kept pure in the midst of many Distractions, and the vio∣lence of desperate Opinions: Take heed of plau∣sible errours that come painted to you with the name of the most glorious truths: Lose not your glory at last; try and weigh every tittle that is propounded: It's my desire you may have the glorious Title given to you the Bereans had, to be () men of better breeding then to take up any thing on trust, though from the A∣postles themselves, untill you know how they were inspired: Compare Scripture with Scri∣pture; do not distract your selves in the Gospel▪ lay truths together, they will shine in their proper glory: Part not so easily with antient enta l d priviledges: Have so much pity to your Chil∣dren, as not to blot their names out of Heaven by your own hands, until God do it by soveraignty; do not bury them alive: Those that know the riches of such a priviledge, will not easily part with it upon such poor terms as most propose. I plead for poor Infants; and it's but charity to speak for those whose tongues are tied. I intend brevity in this, as in all the following Discourse.
 The Lord fill you with wisdom and under∣standing, and give you to know what his per∣fect will is, and hearts to obey it: And thrive like Saints of the New Testament, that lie at Christs breasts night and day. These are the desires of
