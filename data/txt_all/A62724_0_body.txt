ONce, since I exposed
a former part of these
relations, I thought
rather, to have letten
that go out of it selfe,
which had gotten out into the light;
then by adding more fuell to warme
my selfe any longer at the censures
of my owne kindling. But leisure
and a long winter, joyn'd with the
other incentives of my friends, made
me light at last this end too; I doubt
to wast before the Sun, and burne

day-light, being only a divulger
of things, that were before publick in
other languages. And so, my only wis∣dome
might have been, to have hid∣den
my head in obscurity, while I left
my body so obnoxious: but I love not
to complement so far, as to furnish
any one, with a reall argument a∣gainst
myselfe. I had rather have it
thought, as it is in truth, that I am
not meerely a Collectour out of any
others, that have written in the
same fashion, which no other has
done hitherto: but I myselfe have
made my own subject, and squar'd
my designe out of whole quarries'

without any injury to another man's
wall. Though, I must confesse, I have
not yet deserv'd to challenge so
much credit to my self, without any
other recommendation. But as the
first is above my merit; so the
second is too verse to my proper in∣clination:
And therefore, I appeale
rather, to the favour of my fortune,
which lies in the Candor of my
Readers, and so take a long adieu of
them, and of any the like adven∣tures
for the future.
