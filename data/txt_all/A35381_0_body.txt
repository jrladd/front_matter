Right Worshipful,
LET it not seem strange in so Solemn a Business, in which no less than the Preservation of Life, Health, and by consequence Wel-being of all the poor People in this Nation is concerned; in so weighty a business, contrary to all Presidents in this Nation, which is now Heart-sick of Ignorance, and cries out aloud for cure; in so Populous a City, and so full of Cri∣ticks, before so many Ancient Physitians who might have done the Work better than I, had they not wanted will; neither could they have wan∣ted that, had they not wanted real Love to this Nation: in such times (I say) in such a place, and before such People, for me whose years are few, whose Exercise in the Physical Sphere small, (my greatest Studies be∣ing spent about Natural Phylosophy) whose Judgment slender to venture upon this so great a Work as to attempt to rectifie the Judgments of a whol Colledg, (which is indeed no less needful than great) may seem to some perhaps, great Arrogancy and Presumption, to others no smal in∣solency and want of discretion: Notwithstanding, the Glory of God being my Aim, and the good of this languishing Nation my End (I do not call the Nation languishing in respect of Government, but in respect of Knowledg, as for the Government of this Nation, God knows what he hath to do, and I hope well) which I say languisheth so sorely under a Disease which now turned Epidemical and rages so extreamly that it sweeps away millions in a year, leaving many woful Widdows, and Fa∣therless Children to the protection of those whose mercies are cruelty, and that is Ignorance in Physick, or want of Knowledg of what may do them good; the Cure of this Disease cannot be performed neither by Aurum potabile, nor the Phylosophers Stone, but by the real indeavors of a Pub∣lick Spirit by the Fear of God, and Love to poor People, by laboring to discharge a good Conscience, by instructing People what belongs to their Health; this I as∣sure you was the reason that moved me to adventure into the Stage of

the World in this Nature, and not any sinister ends of my own whatsoe∣ver, for it is not unknown to your Worship that I have incurred many E∣nemies by my writing, though I do good, and but my duty; yet I shall ever chuse rather to satisfie the Godly minds of real Common-wealths∣men, in revealing to them what belongs to the Preservation of their Lives, and the helping of their poor Neighbors, than either wrong my own Conscience, or rob the whol Nation of what I may and ought to re∣veal to them: I confess I have chiefly been reviled of those to whom I have done good, who have received their greatest Knowledg of Physick by my Writings; I can pity them, but do not wonder a whit at it; it hath been so even in the dayes of old, when Christ and his Apostles lived upon Earth, they cast out Devils, they cured their Diseases, they made the Blind to see, and the Lame to go, for which of all these good Deeds were they persecuted? doubtless it was done by that Monster Envy wch rules in the children of Disobedience, who having joyned to himself Pride, and Self-interest labors to surpress whatsoever is well done; but as I have fellowship with Christ and his Apostles in their Sufferings, so I look to have fellowship with them in that Glory into which no Proud, nor Envious, nor Self-seeking man shall enter. I can freely (as I hitherto have done) yet continue doing them good, as being perswaded that by so doing, I am the more like unto God, who causeth the Sun to shine upon the good and the bad, and the Rain to fall upon the just and the unjust; following that Rule which is so often repeated in holy Writ, If thy Enemy hunger give him meat, if he be athirst give him drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.
Worthy Sir, This Child of mine coming out the fourth time into the World, and wanting Defence, as most Truths do, cried aloud for a Patron which made me so bold as to present it at your feet; rather I wil assure you, to take a Pattern of your Patience than any waies to make a purchase of my own praise, that so in despight of Cavaliers it may be called the God-child of a Peerless God-father. You must not expect large incomiums of praise from him whose words & actions you know alwaies to be so plain, nor an Epistle stuffed as full of Flattery as an Egg is full of meat, which I hate to give, and you to receive, and God hates it in whom∣soever he finds it; it is sufficient to you, and infinite joy to me, that your Works declare to the World what you are, even in these times when rich Pluto is accounted a better Phylosopher than learned Plato, when Godliness is not accounted great Gain, as it was in better times than now are, but Gain is accounted great Godliness. I had Reasons enough to make me bold to dedicate it to you, as namely, That Ingenuity of your Spirit, your excellent Endeavors for the publick Good, that admirable Con∣stancy which Honor it self could not choak; so that your Splendor (like other Justices in Office with you) has not gone out like a Candle, and left a stinking snuff behind, though it hath pleased God to place you in Authority in such an Age, that calleth Vertue Vice, and Vice Vertue, that calleth Good, Evil, and Evil, Good, that strike at the Devil, and hit Christ in his Saints: To whom rather (these things considered) should I dedicate these my weak Labors, than to your self, to whom God

hath given the Knowledg to discern Vertue from Vice, to love the one and hate the other, according to that excellent Speech of Plato, Oh Know∣ledg, how would men love thee if they did but know thee, for as Health is the Con∣servation of the Body, so is Knowledg the Conservation of the Mind, which is too too much absconded (the more is the pity) from the eyes of this langui∣shing Nation, and calls aloud for a Cure, for as Plato saith in another place, If Vertue could take upon her a bodily shape, she would be so beautiful as men would be in love with her; also if Vice could take upon her a Bodily shape, she would be such an ugly beast all men would loath and disdain her, for if Drunkards have so many Apish and beastly postures, what would Drunkenness it self have, which is the Author of them all, if that could appear in a visible form? This I know you are well versed in; the love of a Real Common-wealth may be read in you even through a pair of Spectacles glassed with an inch board: this was another argument moving me to dedicate this Book to you, which tends towards the furtherance of a Common-wealth, and the pulling down a Monopoly extreamly prejudicial, yet scarce discernable.
I must be brief, because it is brevity you delight in, therefore to use many words I account it needless; your kind acceptance of this Book, I shall account such a favor as is never to be forgotten: The God of Hea∣ven and Earth which hath hitherto preserved your Body in so many dangers and difficulties which you have passed, and your Spirit pure in these back-sliding Times, still be your Guide, and preserve your Spirit, Soul, and Body untill the time of your Change shall come, and present you blameless at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom God hath loved you, and washed you from your sins in his Blood.
So praies, Sir
