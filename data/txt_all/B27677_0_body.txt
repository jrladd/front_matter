My Lord,
YOur Lordship has so often and so high∣ly obliged me, that I cannot but con∣demn my self for giving you a trouble so Impertinent, as this is: Considering how re∣miss I have been in my respects to your Lordship, in that I have not waited on you so frequently as the duty I owe your Lordship and my own Inclina∣tions required; But the Circumstances of my Condition, whose daily business must be daily Bread, have not, nor will allow me that happiness: Be pleased then my Lord to accept this humble dedica∣tion as an Instance of his Gratitude, who in a high measure owes his well-being to you. I cannot doubt but your Lordship will protect it, for nothing ever flew to you for succor unsuccessfully, I am sure I have reason to acknowledge it. As for the unluckey censures some have past upon me for this
 Play, I hope your Lordship will believe I hardly deserve 'em. For to my best remembrance, when first I was accused of the thing by some people of the World, who had perhaps as little reason to think I could be guilty of it, as to believe them∣selves deserved it, I made it my business to clear my self to your Lordship, whose good opinion is dearer to me then any thing which my worst Ene∣mies can wrong me of else; I hope I convinc't your Lordship of my Innocence in the matter, which I would not have endeavoured, had it not been Just. For I thank my Stars I know my self better then (for all the Threats some have been pleased to be∣stow upon me) to tell a lie to save my Throat. Forgive me my Lord this trouble, continue me in your Lordships favour and good opinion, and ac∣cept of the Prayers and well-wishes of
