Noble Spirits!
IT will seem strange to you that we should beg a Pardon from you before you know a Crime committed; But such is our harsh Fate, that we shall want as much of your Mercie to the for∣giving of this sad presumption of offering to your view these few poor sheets, the Rich Remains of our too-long-since lost Friend, Mr. FLETCHER, as we shall your favourable Acceptance, and Incouragement in it. The Play was of so Generall a receiv'd Acceptance, that (he Him∣self a Spectator) we have known him un-concern'd, and to have wisht it had been none of His; He, as well as the throng'd Theatre (in despight of his innate Modesty) Applauding this rare issue of his Brain. His Complacencie in his own Work, may be, per∣haps no Argument to you of the Goodness of the Play, any more than our Confidence of it; and we do not expect our En∣comium can do any thing with you, when the Play it self is so near: That will commend it self unto you. And now Farewell our Glory! Farewell your Choice Delight, most noble Gentlemen! Farewell th' Grand Wheel that set Ʋs smaller Motions in Action! Farewell the Pride and Life o'th' Stage! Nor can we (though in our Ruin) much repine that we are so little, since He that gave us being is no more.
Generous Soules!
'Tis not unknown unto you All, how by a cruell Destinie we have a long time been Mutes and Bound, although our Miseries have been sufficiently Clamorous and Expanded, yet till this hap∣py opportunitie, never durst vex your open Ears and Hands: But this we're confident of will be the surest Argument for your Noblesses. What an Ingenious Person of Qualitie once spake of his Amours, we apply to our necessities,
Silence in Love betrays more Wo
Than Words, though ne'r so Wittie:
The Beggar that is DƲMB, you know,
Deserves a DOƲBLE PITTIE. But be the Comoedie at your Mercy as We are. Onely we wish, that you may have the same kind Joy in Perusing of it, as we had in the Acting.
