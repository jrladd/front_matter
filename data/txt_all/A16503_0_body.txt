SO many are the Bills of Complaint (Right Honorable) of those who are dayly petitioners vnto your Lordship, for your graue and Conscionable Iudg∣ment in matters of Equity, that there needeth no further testimonie to per∣swade the Consciences of all those, who mourne for the iniquities of the Times: That eyther Conscience is fled already from Earth to Heauen, (as it was long since complained of Iustice) or else the most of men are euen now plotting to banish her out of the world; exercising themselues (contrary to the practice of S. Paul) to haue alwayes their Consciences not voyd, but full of offences both towards God and towards men. But praised be the Lord of mercy, who hath shewed kindnesse towards his Seruants; and placed your Honor as the Lord-pro∣tector of Conscience, in these perillous times of her per∣secution.
 Amongst diuers others whose hearts-desire is bent, to manifest their thankefulnesse to God for his Grace already shewed; and to pray for a dayly encrease of happinesse vnto your Lordship: I am emboldened to send this Anatomie of Conscience, to be reuiued with the warmth of your Honorable fauour in this cold and frozen Age of the world. It was at first preached before the Ho∣norable and worthy Iustices of Assise for the County of Derby; Sir Henry Hobart, Sir Edward Bromely. the memory of whose free Approbation (with the rest of that worthy Auditory,) hath since emboldened mee to cast an eie ouer it once againe; and that I might satisfie the desire of some few, to publish it for the benefit of many. And now if it please your Lordship to vouchsafe vnto it a shadow of Protection; I shall not cease to pray (in pri∣uate, as I doe in publike,) That the Lord will so guard you with his glorious Angels; & guide you by the directi∣on of his gracious Spirit; That all your Counsels, and Actions, may tend to the Glory of his holy Name, the Reliefe and Comfort of the oppressed, the good and be∣nefit of this Church and Common-wealth. And thus commending you to the safe Tuition of the great Lord-Keeper of Israel, I rest,
London,
Iuly 14. 1623.
