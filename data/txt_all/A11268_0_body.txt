LEarned Mecoenas, fauorite of Muses,
Renowned Patron, hater of abuses:
Who sitting in Religions golden Chaire,
Thou her, she thee adornes with vertues rare.
As Phoebe from her Phoebus borrowes light,
Wherwith againe she decketh him by night.
So likewise thou: She thee with swauity,
Thou gracet her with moderne grauitie.
Both I my selfe, and Muse will now assay,
Our tributorie debt to thee to pay.
By dutie bound, vnbound I can be neuer,
Vow'd to your Lordships seruice now and euer.
