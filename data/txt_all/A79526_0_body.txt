SIR,
I Have presented these few Sermons to you; not for their shelter (for a Patrons name cannot defend the Author from the censure of the Reader) but for your advice. Although you cannot want my counsel (having injoyed many advantages above others, in education, of godly counsel, and good Examples) yet your age does, seeing you are now in the day of your choices: and if you need none, yet I owe to your self and Family, whatever may be conducible to your or to their good; the engagements which former daies have layed upon me to serve the Family of Poltimore, are as fresh upon me as ever, and I should gladly embrace any opportu∣nity of manifesting this.
The Stock of Prayers which your dear Fa∣ther (whose memory is precious among the Lords people) hath put up for you, the many Counsels which you have received from your Governours and Tutor, in former and latter years, with the continued Prayers, Exhortati∣ons, and Examples of some very near you, give great hopes that you may stand up in your ho∣noured Fathers place, and with his Title and
Estate inherit that interest which he had in the hearts of them that fear the Lord. If what I have tendered to you, further or quicken you un∣to this, I have my end and my joy.
Above all things beware of delays, the dan∣ger of those you shall easily find by perusing of what follows; vouchsafe to read it seriously, and accept kindly, as it is offered out of faith∣fulnesse and affection, by him who is, Sir,
Tiverton, Aug. 24. 1654.
