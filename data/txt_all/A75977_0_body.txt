Most Wise Princesse,
I Have entred upon a matter hitherto un∣heard of, but not disagreeing with truth; boldly I have done it according to my abi∣lity, but not without some blushing: It is to describe the Nobility and Excellency of the Female Sex; I doe confesse boldnesse with shame∣fac'dnesse hath often strived within me; For as I did think it a thing full of ambition and boldnesse, to com∣prize the innumerable Praises, Vertues, and highest Excellencies of women; So it did seem as a childish modesty of wit to prefer women before men: Hence I alledged an Argument, wherefore none hitherto (as I cer∣tainly know) have dared to exalt the eminency of wo∣men above men, when very few dared to write so much as concerning their praises. Therefore I did thinke it a thing full of ingratitude to be silent, even as to envie, and rob so deserving a Sex of its most just, and due praises; so that while I did stick perplexed within my selfe amongst these various and dissonant opinions, I was made more bold in writing, with this wonderfull fear of ingratitude, when as indeed I should have been more bold, had I suppressed such a truth by my silence. I can∣not then but interpret it for a good omen, as if the pro∣vince of this matter had been left and decreed to me

from above, which hitherto the multitude of learned men seem utterly to have neglected. I shall freely therefore declare the glory of women, and their accomplishments I shall not hide; in doing which, far be it from me that I should be ashamed of the argument taken in hand, that if I prefer women before men, I may think I ought to be dispraised for this, as scarcely I can beleeve that I shall be excused, who have composed a matter so sub∣lime with a lower forme of speaking then ought to be, except the streightnesse of time, difficulty of the mat∣ter and justnesse of the cause did defend me, as also, because I have entred upon this worke with no desire of flattery or assentation: therfore I have not so much studi∣ed to adorn my words with Rhetorical fictions, and offi∣cious lyes for praises; as to shew the matter it self by Reason, Authority, Examples, and by the testimony of Holy Writ, and of both Lawes. To you, most Illustrious Margaret (whose other part amongst the most famous women of this age through the whole world, Apollo, Di∣ana, Dies, Aurora, Vulcan, five gods have not sufficient∣ly illustrated, as well for your Nobility of birth, as glo∣ry of your Actions) I appoint this worke: therefore devoted, and dedicated, that the lustre of your Sex may shine forth in you, as in a Sun, who hath ascended to the highest degree, because you have exceeded whatsoever hath bin blazed abroad concerning the praises of the Fe∣male Sex, both in Life and Manners by a present example, and a most faithfull witnesse of the same Sex. Farewel most happily, the Grace, Ornament, and Glory of most Noble women, and Princesses, absolute in all respects.
