TO you, youth's Loadstar, London's ornament,
Frend to the Muses, and the well-inclinde,
Louing, and lou'd of euery vertuous mind:
To you these tuneles accents I present,
Of humble stile, and vncouth argument,
Not to requight, but to record your kind
And gentle fauours, by the which you bind,
My best endeuours to acknowledgment.
Accept (I pray) this present in good part,
This simple pleadge of my sincere affection,
Waigh not the worth, but waigh my willing hart
(Perfect good-will suplies all imperfection)
So may I one day wright your worthy name,
In better tunes vpon a bigger frame.
