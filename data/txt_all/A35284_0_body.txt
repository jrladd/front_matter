My Lord,
PErhaps Your Lordship may admire to see your Name fixt before this trifle; But it is the Fate of Persons of Your obliging temper, to receive Persecutions of this nature, in return of Can∣dour and Indulgence; which I must confess is so ill a requital, as it may make Your Lordship cautious hence-forwards of bestowing Your Favours, since this must be the troublesome consequence. But Greatness like Beauty attracts all on whom it smiles; And We frail writing sinners cannot content our selves with the se∣cret enjoyment; but think half the pleasure lost, if we do not boast of it to the world. This vanity occasions your Lordship the present trouble; And next to this, a design to over-aw with Your Name, any the briskest enemies this Poem may meet with; For when I tell 'em, Your Lordship thinks it not much unworthy your Fa∣vour, they will judge moderately of it; at least, not be too forward in censuring any thing, which you are plea∣sed to defend. The enemies it ha's already met with have been fewer, then a Play in Verse, (and an ill one too,) could expect; considering how many there are, that exclaim against Rhime, though never so well writ. Some of 'em I'me afraid do it from the same unjust picque that Women of cruel hearts, but peaceable Beau∣ties ever have against a Mode, wherewith they despair to kill. But I shall not much concern my self with their little quarrel; I am fortunate enough in your Lordships approbation, and can dispense with the rest of man∣kind.

And this I am bold to affirm though I have not the Honour of much acquaintance with your Lordship; for it is sufficient that I have seen in some little sketches of your Pen excellent Masteries and a Spirit inimitable; and that I have been entertained by others with the wit, which your Lordship with a gentile & careless freedom, sprinkles in your ordinary converse, and often supplies vulgar and necessitous wits wherewith to enrich them∣selves, and sometimes to treat their friends; and when your Lordship is pleased to ascend above us, You do it with a strange readiness and agility of mind, and by swift and easy motions attain to heights, which others by much climbing dull industry, and constraint cannot reach. Nor is this vast wit crowded together in a little Soul, where it wants freedom, and is uneasy, but fills up the spaces of a large and generous mind, infinitely delighting to oblige all, but especially to encourage any blossoming merits; and ready to forgive large and voluminous faults for the sake of any one thing tolerably said or done. And now the world sure will not blame me that I esteem my self extremely happy in Your Favour, and secure in Your Patronage; and this being to me, like some great and sudden Fortune to the poor, I know not how to manage my own transports, but must make my brags to my Friends. This my Lord, is a great infirmity, but it is incident to humane Nature, and very common with all of our Tribe; and I do not doubt but your Lordship will pardon it among other defects to
My Lord,
