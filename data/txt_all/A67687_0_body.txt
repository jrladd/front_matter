May it please Your GRACE,
HOW little soever this Treatise may seem, its Designs are certainly the greatest in the World. For the Du∣ty it urges, if consci∣enciously practis'd, will highly con∣duce to the Glory of GOD, and the Good of Souls redeem'd by the
 precious Blood of CHRIST. These, I am sure, are the Considera∣tions that Your GRACE loves and values; and that YOU daily study and strive to advance to the utmost of Your Power. And this Piece falling in with the settled Tendency of Your own most pious Thoughts and Acti∣ons; which are ever inclin'd and zealously carri'd on to further GOD's Honour, and the Happi∣ness of Men: I am prone to believe that YOU will not be averse from the Patronage of the same; YOUR SELF being so eminent and exem∣plary a Promoter of the Ends it aims at.
The Work, I am sensible, hath its Imperfections; but I am willing to hope that my sincere Intentions may recommend it to Your GRACE's favourable Acceptance. And then, I doubt not, but that will so exte∣nuate all its Defects, that others will be the more ready to excuse them.

That the Good GOD, by Whose Divine Providence YOU worthily preside in so high a Station over us, would long preserve YOU in it, as a great Blessing to this Church and Nation; is the most earnest Prayer of,
