Thrice Honorable Lady,
VEre euer loued veritas so well,
And to all vertues gaue such countenance,
That sacred truth for euer vowes to dwell,
In your Breast to be safe from ignorance,
Enuy, and error; and hath warned me,
That where I find vere, challenge there to be
A lodging due to her, (I'dmir'd) and then
Shee sayd to me (as Christ did to the men
He sent to fetch the asse) if they refuse,
The fauours I intreate, make thou but vse,
Of my name vnto them with mild regard,
And thou shalt find my lodging straight prepar'd.
Great Lady with great reuerence I present,
To your Religious view, and gracious eyes
A legacy, a Heauenly or nament,
With the Messias pleas'd to sacrifice,

And send vnto his spouse, to moue her, come
To warne her, call her, and command her home,
Vnto his Heauen; I wish you would accept
My loue and seruice, and this offering take,
As Princes do Imbassadours respect,
Not for their owne, but for their maisters sake
I am ordain'd Gods messenger, t'intreat,
His chosen number to his Heauenly feast.
And you both being truely good and great,
Hath a faire seate prepar'd among the blest,
Your pious bounties, princely beauties, and
Religious wisedome, (which is honors nurse.)
Are guides to lead you vnto Gods right hand;
And likewise motiues caused me disburse,
My loue and seruice in this measure: take it,
My worke's Diume, and my free will doth make it
A perfect offering, t'helpe gamst death and doombe,
Regard this frame, for't will out-last your toombe.
