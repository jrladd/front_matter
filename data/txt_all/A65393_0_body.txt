Madam,
I Here present you with
an Epitomee of some secret
Passages, in the whole
reign of one King, part of anothers:
Of which, my self have been either
an Eare or Eye-witnesse, or, from
the testimony of such as have been
Authours or Actors, therefore un∣questionable
Truths.
It is the Conception and Birth
of four daies, with the help of some
scattered Papers (as a Midwife) to
bring them into the world.
Being therefore but an Embry∣on,

you cannot expect any perfect
shape: But, what it wants in that,
you shall finde in the most perfect
form of undeniable Truths.
The honourable esteem I have
ever had of you, and your brave
Parts, is my first motive of presen∣ting
it to your view: That it comes
from no ordinary Author (this be∣ing
the first, and for ought I know
the last) a second: That it was
written in a Melancholly humour,
therefore fittest for your Melan∣cholly
Temper, the last.
I dare no more trust any other
hand to write this than (willingly)
any but your selfe, or some such
good friends to read it.
Which is the reason it appeares
no fairer to your view. And it

treads too near▪ the heeles of truth,
and these Times, to appear in pub∣lick.
If you shal please to accept of it,
as worthy to cast a glance upon at
your idle, or melancholly hours, I
have my full desires. If cast from
you, it hath just Deserts.
Mine ambition only is, that so
Noble a Lady shal be the God mo∣ther
of the first and only heir, that
ever shall come of this quality,
from
