I Offer to your Honour, the paines of a Noble French∣man, how vnskilfully by me turned into English, I leaue to your wonted honourable consideration: who beeing enriched with so many sin∣guler perfections, will not frowne on the good en∣deuours of an humble well-willer. I haue no meane whereby to excuse my boldnes, but onelie this, a reuerend and vnfained affection to your honour, with forward zeale in duetie to doe anie thing you shall commaund me: if this may ex∣cuse me, it is as much as I desire, and which heereafter I wil better imploy my selfe to deserue.
Your honours humble affectionate, An: Monday. One of the Messengers of her Maiesties Chamber.
