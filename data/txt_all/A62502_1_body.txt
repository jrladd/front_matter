Mr LORD:
VPon discoverie of a late motion in some sheetes, I found my booke to have been hitherto but in a trance, which receiving as I thought, (but knew not from whence) a mortal wound before it ap∣peared in the encounter, I gave over long since for downe right dead & buried in the presse. When it recovered spirits enough to crave my hand, I could not denie it so small a courtesie as to helpe it up. In that it lookes not so vivide and fresh complexioned as heretofore it might, it shares but in the ordinarie effects of such misse-fortune. If resuming what it was speaking a twelve-moneth since, be censured for im∣pertinencie to these times, & (it may be) laughed at by some

for prophesying of things past the possibilitie of their suc∣cesse, the fault may be theirs that disordered the leaves when well suited, and the failing not mine, who undertoke not against all changes of mindes, or alterations of counsels, or preventions of causes running on then visiblie to the same is∣sues I assign'd them in my conjecture. But these exceptions, My Lord, though they clip the fringe, neither unshape, nor shorten the garment I intended as the proper guise for Scotish Presbyteric to be seene in the very same with that wherein the Rt. Reverend Bishop of London Derrie had well clad her, soone afterward not onelic undecentlie discompos'd, but rent in pieces by the rudenesse of an angrie furie, one of those sixc evil spirits that haunted (in the night of sorrow) with both tempting and torrisying apparitions, His Royal MA∣jESTIE and your H. H. at the Hage. From whose prae∣vailing violence no rescue could be offered but by repelling the tempest of his language, wherewith he thought to keepe all Antagonists at a distance, and by blowing in his face the fire & stinking sulphure of his breath. If your Lordship please to passe a litle through the smoke, and take no offense at the smell which in a neare approach will be found to be litle of my making, Truth & reason will be beter discerned in a rea∣dinesse to entertaine you, as some longer traine of Authoritic had likewise if Fathers & Councels in this pilgrimage of ours had been, to a just number, within my reach, and some later Writers at the pleasure of my call. The stand, or at least some impediment in the march, of these Bloudie Presbyters, which this forlorne hope will, in some likelihood cause for a time may by your Lordship, unpraejudic'd, be taken for an hapie augurie of the absolute defeate unquaestionablie to follow, if occasion require, by a greater strength, and that under the

conduct of beter experience in these polemical affaires. In the interim though I humblic crave the honour and power of your patronage (wherof from your integritie and constancie in Gods cause & the Kings, I praesume), I assume not the bold∣nesse to constitute your Lordship any partic in the libertie I take, beyond forward expressions, to declare what may be thought some singularitie in my sence. If any small Politician, whose conscience is squared by no religion at all but what plainlie lies in the image-worship of his temporal designes, will be (which I must looke for to be) quaestioning the pru∣dence of my speaches, I thanke God he hath no priviledge to give judgement against the sinceritie of my thoughts. I can no longer conceale, My Lord, how much I am troubled to see our Churches diffusive charitie mistaken, the precious balme, which she ever liberallie poured into the wounds of her neighbours, cast by some of their hands like common oyle upon her domestike flames purposelie to consume her; And the skirt, she often spread over their nakednesse, cut of, with an unhandsome intent to laugh at her shame, had she not an under garment of innocencie to praevent them. To behold, after so many yeares cantonizing our Religion amongst Pro∣testant Congregations of different opinions, (reconcil'd in nothing but, or nothing more then, in a negative to the Papist) our selves, in the end, at a sad losse for protection (or indeed free permission) from any, now neceslitated to seeke it. This makes me so many times in this discourse turne her away from all new names and professions arising whether from pro∣testations or Covenants, to the unconsoederate Catholike Christia∣nitie among the Ancients where she is sure to have the safest sanctuarie of truth for her doctrine & practice, though she can expect no armed assistance from the dead to maintaine the

distressed Members of her communion. If this must be in∣terpreted a schismatical inclination, let me be left in my hold upon the hornes of this altar, while others rise from their knees to sit downe, out of good felloship, at the Tables; and drinke of all waters they care not what, so draw'n from a cisterne of the Reformed, forsaking or vilifying, for the time, that clearer Chrystal fountaine of their owne. Whereas would they enter, as they are quaestionlesse obliged, an un∣animous resolution to demand every where the publike exer∣cise of their canonical devotion, they would either, upon the grant, reape more comfort in continuing the worship of their Fathers, or, upon unworthie denial, more reason to scruple at such a facile conjunction with them, who disclaiming their prayers can not be thought serious when they praetend an harmo∣nie in that faith by which they are exhibited unto God. And (to put your Lordship in minde of a late instance delivered on good credit) who maligning our persons, & mocking at our calamities in their Scholes, are very unlikelie so to alter their mindes as to turne their Barbarous reproach into any bro∣therlie kisse or Christian welcome, when they step but the next doore into their Temples. I confesse, My good Lord, this Magisterial advice may beter become the mouth of some Elder Pastour, who is likelie to have more sheep wandring from his fold then he who can scarce properlie be said to have had any in his charge yet none such, I hope, hath reason to take amisse my modest endeavour, while he is otherwise imployed, to recover those I finde stragling within my call. It being upon due consideration to be feared, that after some few yeares (if there must be yet more of our miserable disper∣sion) with out an universal industrious circumspection of yong and old, as we have broken our pipes, we may throwe

away our whistles, and fold up our time with our armes in a comfortlesse discourse about the flockes we once had which now alas are got into other pastures; Invite strangers to fight for our Churches while our owne Congregations are instituted to forget the holinesse in the separation of such places, the sa∣cred distance of the meanest from worke-or ware-houses, and the fairest from Piatz'as of pleasure or Exchanges for their bar∣gaines. If what I speake, My Lord, be truth, I shall not hearken to them that may tell me it is misse placed, my conscience suggesting that the climate & season hath too often been here∣tofore neglected; If false, I have a spunge as readie as ever I had a pinne to wipe out all but my shame, which shall be set forth, at your Lordships pleasure, in an English sheet, though it never will be brought unto the Scotish stoole to do its pe∣nance. In attendance on which sentence, if neither your Lord∣ships approbation nor pardon must be expected, I stoup downe to acknowledge my selfe, aswell in submission to your censure as execution of your commands:
MY LORD,
