My ever honoured good Lord,
NO so base attribute but might
justly be vented against mee,
had I so farre supprest Your
Lo▪ most generous goodnes, and
many singular favours con∣ferred
on my demerits, as not
in this dutifull dedication, sa∣crificed
to the altar of your
larger merits, present this
small offering of my greater good will and affection: I
will not implore your propitious acceptance, for your
noted and courteous affability to all, and gracious accep∣tance
of meanest gifts, animates me to this presumpti∣on.
What your knowne vertues (my Lord) are, would

require a more accurate and tighter Pen than mine to
delineate; yet were not the world so given, that even
truthes themselves are taken for palpable flatteries, I
could tell with what universall applause and commen∣dation
your younger vertues and generosities in your
travels made even strangers to honour and admire
you! I could tell what great hopes our Countrey hath
already received, that you will not onely to the Lands
and Possessions of your worthily noble Father, succeed
as Heyre, but to his singular Knowledges and Vertues
also; which have already so fairely budded and now
ripen so hopefully, that none can doubt the successe; I
could tell too of your Prudence, Courage, Charity, and
your other ample endowments; but I am so full of ad∣miration
of your every goodnesse, that what the Tra∣gedian
said of Cares, I may of my affections, Leves
loquuntur, ingentes stupent: Accept then (my deare
Lord) for expression of all, this little Booke; which,
how voluminous and accurate soever it could be, were
due to your high deservings from me; That Your Lo:
in it, is mixed with so noble Partners, I hope for par∣don
not reproofe, which likewise intreate for all my o∣ther
trespasses and boldnesse with your Honour, al∣wayes
humbly desiring the continuance of your Noble
Love and Favours to one, who would no longer wish to
live, if it were not both to live and die
