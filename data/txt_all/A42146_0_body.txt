WHen we first saw your Book, read the Title, and how you pretend your Questions are for Conscience sake; we thought Silence for some time would be the best Answer, considering what hath formerly past between us about the Difference still depending, and the present face of things, as they now shew themselves in the world.
But when we came to take a view of your E∣pistle, finding it writ by some spirit inraged, ra∣ther than one desirous of satisfaction from any se∣rious, sober, conscientious scruple, or doubt, We were invited the more to consider your Questions; and finding them to strike at the root, fill'd with ani∣mosity, taunting and insulting terms, rather than a spirit so much as sprinkled with conscious, candid, and serious aims, though you give your selves the name, as the obscure Parents of this (in some
 sense) abortive Child of the Lovers of Truth and Peace, which bespeaks the Babe both conceived and brought forth under the melevolent Aspects of some froward contentious (and yet pretended glori∣ous and Christian) design.
Your Epistle, which as the Midwife that brought the Child into the world, we find ushers it in with caluminations so foul, and of such a sort, as if it were intended to scale Rome's Walls, and bid De∣fiance to the Man there that usurps the Keyes of Heaven and Hell.
And withal, that way may be made for its more laudable entrance and progress, she no sooner speaks, but, like Athalia, she cryes Treason, treason, (the Lord's Prerogative is invaded) when alas, she was the Traytor her self; and then she marcheth on, and proclaims them (she is sent to with so much pretended calmness) to be like the Man at Rome, usurpers of the Keyes of Hell and Death.
But how much the mark is missed is evident e∣nough, for who more free and ready to stop up the way to Hell, and open the way to Heaven, so far as lies in them, by all the abilities they have, and endeavours they can use, than they whom you brand with the aforesaid Usurpation. Though we would not make the road to Heaven as the foolish Woman and clamourous doth the way to her House, saying, Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant, to her guests.
And though your Babes-Usher hath got the knack
 on't to clamour with so much scurrility, by such oyly lines, perhaps borrowed from some other Pen, yet is it an argument of a weak Cause rather than other∣wise, it being usual, when there is no better wea∣pons to make use of such, with this gloss, The Lords Prerogative is invaded, and what wilt thou do to thy great Name? and the like; when you your selves are the invaders of that Royal Prerogative of the Lord's Anointed, by not suffering his Princely Authority to be obeyed without controule from you; and such his leige People to whom his Prerogative and Name is more dear than their lives, as suffici∣ent testimony hath been given, and further may through his grace, should he call for it. You study against wayes of obtractation.
But how easie a matter is it for men to pretend to Conscience in their own Case, and with the same Pen, bespatter the Consciences of others with foul inormities of meer pretences under that cloak, as if they made bates, and pretended Conscience; but let the sober inspect this new-born Babe, and they will see make-bate writ in the face of him, though it hath Conscience for its Name, and is sir∣named a Lover of Truth and Peace; and do but trace it in its proceedings, and let but its conception be calculated, and they will find it both conceived and brought forth to that end, it being furnished with Confidence sufficient to pass it without suspition of being tardy of any such thing as make-bate, while it can talk of Peace and Unity among Bre∣thren,
 and pretend to more than ordinary zeal to it; and that it may go abroad without jealousie of the contrary, all that stands in its way, must be ren∣dred as maintainers of Notions, catch'd up and charged upon Conscience, without regard had to the interest of Religion, yea, and renting and run∣ning away from all that agree not with them, when there is nothing less intended by you, than to run divisions among us that are united in that thing under debate.
And for the more effectual accomplishment of this design, we must also be rendred as such that take upon them to judge all that come not up to the same dimensions with us, not to have God, nor to have communion with God, when our judgment in that case is, Those that transgress and abide not in the Doctrine of Christ, have not God as his Church hath; not that thereby you or any man is judged by us, to have, or not to have God: And as for you, we have before given our Testimony, that we can, and do love you for the Truths sake you own, so far as you have gone, or so far as you do own the Truth; but we cannot, nay we dare not love you with the love of Brethren in the true and right order of the Gospel. See Gods Oracle, and Christs Doctrine, page 94. then have you no cause to render us, as judging all but our selves in no sense to have God, nor communion with God.
And if you have better Arguments to prove your in erest in Christ than laying on of Hands, we
 have no cause to grieve at it, but to rejoyce; and can with all our hearts wish you have; for laying on of Hands can be none for you, (and it will be well if it be none against you) who have so long opposed it with so much bitterness, as you have done, and and still do. But be we esteemed your Friends or your Enemies, for saying, you are not a Church rightly Constituted, and so have not God as his Church; we must still say it, until our Judgments and Consciences be otherwise perswaded by his Word; and if you will not believe what we say, we must leave it to the revelation of the righteous Judgment of the Lord, who will then make the decision of that, and also of your uncharitable judg∣ment of us, That if we could execute all (as you say) we condemn, then who shall be saved? you had as well said, none; though thanks be to God we have our testimony on high, how much we have laboured and travelled for the Salvation of Souls; nor have you any cause to say, The Devil may have a Writ of Ease from any Judgment or Practice of ours; for, to the praise of God we speak it, we have been by him made Instruments to turn men from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to God, and not a few: but if any do give the De∣vil a Writ of Ease, and bring Prey to the Den of that great Devourer, it is more like to be you that seek to keep men from the Truth, and that leave no stone unturned, to draw them that are in it, to the
 like dis-esteem you your selves have of it: And in∣deed, before you had charged others with Church-dividing, you should first prove your selves to be a true Constituted Church, and then cry out against the Ignorance and Pride of those that Separated from you; but while that beam is in your eye, how can you discern aright the moat in anothers? for as the Devil can dance at discord, so he can dance at concord, in confusion and disorder; when Unity is kept in Iniquity and Error, nothing can please the Father of Lyes better, promote his interest, enlarge his kingdom, and give a more secure Writ of Ease than that will; and therefore, if he be no better furnished, than where Unity is kept with Truth, and Unity in Iniquity, and Error is avoided, he may go look for Men and Arms where he can find them; for where Unity and Truth are together, and Truth and Unity are individuals, he will find none: And what will lay the Church more open to ruine and spoyle, than Unity in Error and Sin? and who, that is a Christian, can rejoyce in such Tro∣phies? the Devil shall gain by such victories, yet will Church-divisions do much, and cause her Ene∣mies to triumph; let them take it to themselves that are guilty thereof: Men in such cases most times miss the mark, and lay not the saddle on the right horse, but satisfie and please themselves by charging others with that they want proof of, that so the Plea for themselves may the better
 pass for Not guilty, by crying up lawful Sepa∣ration to be Church-Renting, and a wounding Christs Body. And who will sooner reflect the want of Knowledge, and Pride, than such who are proud, knowing nothing, but doting about Questions? 1 Tim 6.3, 4.
And how many men might silently go to their Graves without noise, had they not secured their Names, and in some kind their Reputation, by such doting ways, and contendings against Truth, by branding others with the infamous character of Church-breaking? And while they do this, kindle a Fire to themselves, and then delight in the sparks thereof; withal reflecting the guilt of it on others, being ambitious that none are so holy, humble, and wise as they: and besides, think it their duty to sa∣crifice in the flame of their own fire, all their abili∣ties and parts, to promote their intended designs; not standing much upon it, if to help forward the Work they venture to adde a little Hypocrisie, that with fair words and feigned speeches, they might the better deceive the hearts of the simple: And that by stigmatizing others with the name of foolish Builders, and unskilful Physitians, you (like Ab∣salom) might get in place your selves; and while you pity the state of others in this defect, crave the work your selves, as Builders, and the Cure, as Physitians; who yet have not attained the skill to lay a foundation. And if your skill to cure, be o
 better than to build; there's but small hopes for them that imploy you, but to be destroyed by your Building, and to die by your Practice.
And most sure it is, that this will be the issue, if such unskilful Builders and Physicians be courted as they have been by some, to lend their assistance and advice; whose pride and interest is such, that will not suffer them to be controul'd in their work, since their hearts are so stout, and their conceits of themselves are so high, that they will not indure that should be amended, which they have unskilfully built. What will then an agreement to joyn with you, to build, & to cure (though stiled happy) prove, but lit∣tle better than destruction, and a languishing under an incurable disease, whose Reputation will not admit of any Regulation, that have so long made opposition against the true Rules of sure and safe Building? And then how shall they become Truths Proselytes, that have rejected it so long, without assuming the guilt of what they stand charged with, which may expose them to reject Conviction, rather than lose their Credit and Reputation? For which they must say, we make causless Separation, hating them, and casting them out, when none they charge are guilty of the one, nor of the other, as the An∣swers to your Questions will inform you; which we present to your serious Consideration; believing that Peace is the blessing of the most High, when Truth and Purity joyn hands with it. And O how happy
 a thing, and desirable, is such a Peace and Unity! And how much longed for! But ah! when will it once be? How can this so desirable a thing be hoped for, while Truth and You stand at a distance? Your subjection to Christ, in owning and obeying that sacred Appointment of his, which you have made such opposition against, may heal the Breach, by which you will be baptized into one Body with us; and so you and we may grow up together a Temple and holy Habitation of God through the Spirit.
