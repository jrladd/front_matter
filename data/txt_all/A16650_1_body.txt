DAINTY fine Creatures, —I will not sweare, in good faith you be; But—if in your censure you prove sweet to me, I little care, believe 't, how sowre you be. One thing I must tell you, the World ha's a strange opinion of you: But let not this trouble you: for the most of those that sojourne in it, are Walking Pictures, or Puppy Motions. So you live without Scandall, let the Constable of the Ward snore, and Diogenes walke all the night o're with his Candle. Though he finde Works of lightnesse in Houses of darknesse: Single Skir∣mishes

in blinde Alleys, Back-stayres, and long Entries: whole bunches of Cornucopia in his new-found Euto∣pia: Cleave you like Ticks to your own, preserve your renowne, and sing Hey downe a downe, to the honour of our Towne.
Thus, neither to all, nor to many, but to very-very few, and those of that Crue, who are loyall and true, bids Musaeus
Adiew.
