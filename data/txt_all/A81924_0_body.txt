Right Honourable:
These Scriptural Assertions, at their first con∣ception, were not designed for the Pub∣lique; they were only put to Paper at the desire of those, who in this City gave me a call to the Cure of their soules, and were willing to reform their wayes according to the will of God. And because they did confesse their ignorance of the whole Frame and Government of the House of GOD; my aime was to let them see it, as briefly as I could, in a Model taken from the patern which I have seen in the Mount, which the Scriptures have revealed.
I would not be large, of purpose, to the end that I might stirre them up the more to Meditation, to the searching of the Scriptures, from which I have endea∣voured to gather all; and to conference with my self,
 when they should be at a stand. I intended nothing, but according to their desire to give them private satisfacti∣on; yet they would not rest there, but insisted to en∣gage me to publish these Heads of thoughts (for in effect they are no more:) Nor was it enough to make them publike, but they would have me to owne them, and to present you also with them. To all which you may per∣ceive that I have condescended, although I confesse with much reluctancie.
Not that I am ashamed to owne any thing that is mine, though so imperfect as this is, and in a matter of so great consequence, (for I am very well conscious to mine own weaknesse, and not unwilling that others should perceive it, (if it may be for their edification) or that I was doubtfull of any Truth here delivered, (for I conceive that all may be made out to the full, if God should give time, and a call to do it) but that I was loth to offer unto all whom I could not know, that which I had designed only for a few, whom in cases of mistake I would be able to rectifie. I was unwilling to seem to intermeddle to so little purpose, as these Tracts are like to be, in matters of so high concernment, in a season so full of distraction, and in an Age so willing to censure, so apt to mistake, and so ready to misconstrue on all hands every thing that hath no character of par∣tiality upon it, though done never so harmlesly: And then also I was afraid to be thought to stretch my selfe beyond my line, in making this addresse unto You. But I hope that your favourable acceptance, and the Relation which I have to a particular Congregation in the City, will free me from this last apprehension; and from the former I have been taken off, partly by the consideration of greater inconveniences which might follow upon the
 not yeelding, then upon the yeelding unto a publication; partly by the importunity of the Call which I received to do what here is done. So that I hope none other con∣struction will be made of the publication of these Notions than ought in charity to be made; which is to believe, That I being earnestly desired to declare my knowledge of the truth of these matters, thought my self bound to beare witnes thereunto, and to suffer my testimony to come to the light, that it might appeare that these works are done in God, that they are free from humane respects; and that my aim in putting them forth, is to give occasion to men conscionably peaceable, to consider whether yea or no, an agreement in these Truths ought not to oblige Brethren to a neerer conjunction of spirits, & profession of unity, then we as yet are come unto? and whether yea or no, the things wherein there is a difference of opinion, deserve so much distance in affections, as many are fallen into, or ought to be debated in such a way of heat as most men follow, whereby they rather disturbe then edifie one another. It is a sad thing to see men that are called Chri∣stians and Brethren, exercising their wits to the disparage∣ment of one another in Religious matters; and to deale with things concerning Conscience, lightly, passionately, and without all serious and conscionable gravity. These things are to be deplored, but cannot be redressed, without the acknowledgement of the Truth; nor can the Truth be received without the spirit of Love and Peace, which the Word of the Gospel doth administer only.
The Lord of truth and peace reveal the same unto us all more and more; and direct You in your station to walk therein as pat∣terns of Righteousnes before all others. Which, with the wishes of prosperity unto the settlement of this whole State; shall be towards the LORD who alone is able to save, the constant Prayer of
