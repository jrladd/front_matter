Worthie Sir,
THe selfe same office of loue and due prayses which the world put it selfe into, at your long desired ariuall in England, fals happily vpon me to performe the like duetie toward your worthy Brother, nor can I recite more Encomiums of his Actions, then those of your owne hath rightly and properly challenged to themselues; Ile speake thus much of you both, and the world shal iudge it free from flattery, you well may bee owne Brothers in birth, that are so neere kinne to one another in Actions of Fame and Honour: so commending you both to eterni∣zing memory of your owne Vertues and Fortunes, I re∣maine an vnworthy obseruer of them both.
