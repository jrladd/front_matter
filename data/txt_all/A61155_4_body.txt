Honourable,
I Here present you with some Notions of the Bre∣thren of the Presbyterian Way, which were presen∣ted to your HOUSE some foure or five yeares since; wherein they doe in much strength and pi∣ety, as it seems to me, open the way and secrets of Spirituall Tyranny, and Conscience-yoaks; there is some occasion now of reminding the Brethren of these, because the straine of their preaching and printing seemes to have for∣gotten these principles: Spirituall▪ Yoks and Burdens being taken off from us (through the hand of God upon ye) the memory of them seems to be gone off too from some; some have forgotten that they were strangers in the Land of Egypt; the Lord hath see∣med to forgive the formerly Nonconforming Brethren all their debt, because they desired him: And now the Question is, Whether they should have compassion on their fellow servants as he had pity on them?
The Controversie now before ye, is of all your Faithfull ones, and therefore it cals for the tenderst judgement: Fathers may bet∣ter beat servants then children out of doores; the one sort  I mistake not) contend that they may rule with ye▪ the oth t they may be ruled by ye in the things of your owne Kingdome

and in that of the Kingdome of God, that Iesus Christ may rule both ye and them: how just, how spirituall, this latter plea is, will appeare from the choycest Reasonings of some in reputation with ye, which I have awakened.
The things I present ye, I would not presume to make too po∣sitive, because I would not conclude a wisdome of your latitude under any notion of mine, (though I see private men take too much liberty in that way towards ye) though it is your indul∣gence not to know it.
I here present ye things only to be considered, to be quaered, in the behalf of truth, and the advancement of your State, to which I am covenanted; and I am the bolder and freer, having sold something that I had for that pearle, for which we are bidden to sell all: I shall adde some Considerations here to the rest:
1. Consider whether under Popery the mystery of the Nati∣onall Priesthood was not rather held up by the power of Princes and States, then States themselves by such a way of power; and whether the mystery of the Nationall Ministery be not rather held up by the power of States now, then the States themselves in such a way of power; and then, whether all the Pretences and Consequences to draw in States and Kingdomes for the Churches in∣terest (if clearly discussed) be not rather a way of Antichristian mystery▪ then of zeale to Religion, or the power of Magistracy?
2. Consider whether in the Kingdome of Jesus Christ any other Scepter should be lifted up then that golden one of his own, and whether if there be a Kingdom of God, if Iesus Christ be the Lawgiver, and the Spirit of of Christ the interpreter of those Laws, and this Kingdom of God within the throne of that King of Kings, and Lord of Lords the Lord Iesus, any other power should rule, any other Scepter▪ any other Laws, or any other sit down in that Throne, which is only the Throne of the Son of Da∣vid▪ whose Throne is for ever, the Scepter of whose Kingdom is an e∣verlasting Scepter?
3. Consider whether there be not an Heathenish or Genti∣lish world, and an Antichristian world, or a world of ma∣ny called Christians and beleevers in Christ, and yet a Church of Christ which is neither of these; and if so, whether is all this

Kingdom of England that Church of Christ, or not rather much of it that part of the Antichristian world, over which one part of the mystery of iniquity hath sat long, and is yet upon it? And if so, then is there not room in England both for Presbyteriall Churches, and Believers of other waies to live in that part of this Kingdom which is the world, and not that Church? And if so, ye may be rich in people, rich in peace, rich in the praises of the people of God. Honourable, go on to do worthy things▪ for our Nation, as worthy things have been done by you▪ and may ye be as the wings of a Dove covered with Silver, and her feathers with yellow Gold.
So praies,
