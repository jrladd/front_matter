May it please Your Majesties,
I Should not presume to lay this Treatise
at Your Royal Feet, but that it con∣cerns
a Noble Kingdom, which is
one of the most considerable Branches of
Your Mighty Empire.

It is of great Advantage to it, that it is a
Subordinate Kingdom to the Crown of Eng∣land;
for it is from that Royal Fountain that
the Streams of Justice, Peace, Civility, Riches
and all other Improvements have been de∣rived
to it;Campion 15. so that the Irish are (as Campion
says) beholding to God for being conquer∣ed:Davis, 2.
And yet Ireland has been so blind in this
Great Point of its true Interest, that the Na∣tives
have managed almost a continual War
with the English, ever since the first Con∣quest
thereof; so that it has cost Your Royal
Predecessors an unspeakable Mass of Blood
and Treasure to preserve it in due Obedi∣ence.
But no Cost can be too great where the
Prize is of such Value; and whoever consi∣ders
the Situation, Ports, Plenty, and other
Advantages of Ireland, will confess, That it
must be retained at what rate soever; because
if it should come into an Enemy's Hands,
England would find it impossible to flourish;
and perhaps difficult to subsist without it.
To demonstrate this Assertion, it is enough
to say, That Ireland lies in the Line of Trade,
and that all the English Vessels that sail to
the East, West and South, must, as it were,
run the Gauntlet between the Harbours of
Brest and Baltimore: And I might add, That
the Irish Wool being transported, would

soon ruine the English-Clothing-Manufa∣cture.
Hence it is, that all your Majesties Prede∣cessors
have kept close to this Fundamental
Maxim, Of retaining Ireland inseparablely u∣nited
to the Crown of England: And though
King Henry II, may seem to deviate from this
Rule, by giving the Kingdom to his Son
John; yet this is to be said for him, That
he thought the Interest and Expectations his
Son had in England, would be security enough
against his Defection; and the rather, because
he could not then keep Ireland without con∣tinual
Aids and Supplies from hence: How∣ever,
this very Example was thought so dan∣gerous,
that Ireland was never given away
since that time, except once by Henry the
Third, and then only to the Prince, who was
his Heir apparent, and on this express Con∣dition,
Ita quod non separetur a Corona An∣gliae.
I do not mention that unaccountable
Patent to Robert de Vere Earl of Oxford
and Duke of Ireland; not only because there
was a Tenure by Homage reserved, so that
it was not a total Alienation, and because it
was but for Life, and cum mixto Imperio▪
but chiefly because it never took effect, so
that it was but Ʋmbratilis Honor, & cito
evanuit.

But it is needless to tell your Majesties,
That Ireland must not be separated from Eng∣land;
or to solicit your speedy Reduction of
that Kingdom, since the loss of it is incom∣patible
with Your Glory; and to suffer the
Ruin of four hundred thousand Irish Prote∣stants,
meerly for their adherence to Your
Majesties and their Religion, is inconsistent
with your Goodness.
But, in Truth, the Recovery of Ireland
was not proper for Your Majesty's Under∣taking,
until it became difficult beyond the
Hopes of others; any Body can do easie things,
but it is Your Majesty's peculiar Talent to
atchieve what all the rest of the World think
Impossible: Your Majesty did so, in buoy∣ing
up a sinking State, and restoring it to a
more Glorious Condition than ever it was in
before▪ And Your Majesty did so again, in
retrieving from Ruine two expiring King∣doms,
that were at their last Gasp; and the
Recovery of the third, is all that remains to
consummate your Glory, and make You the
Darling both of Fame and of Fortune.
And when that is done, Madam, the bright
Example of your Majesty's Virtue and Piety
will influence that degenerate Nation to such
a degree of Reformation and Religion, as
will restore that Kindgdom to its ancient Ap∣pellation,
and Ireland will again be called, Insu∣la
Sacra.

That Your Majesty's Glorious Designs,
for the Advantage of England, and the Re∣covery
of Ireland, for the Propagation of the
Protestant Religion, and for the Good of
Mankind, may be blessed with Success, suit∣able
to Your Majesty's Generous and Pious
Intentions: And that Your Majesties long
and happy Reign here may be crowned with
Everlasting Happiness hereafter, shall be the
fervent as well as daily Prayers of,
May it please Your Majesties,
