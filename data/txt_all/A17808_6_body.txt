I Here presume to consecrate to your perpetuall Honour, this Booke, which vnder the Honourable Shield of your Noble protections I haue sought to shelter, And where∣fore?
It is that these Noble persons haue by their worthy liues, purchased Ho∣nour to their noble selues, or else their Prodecessors haue by their Vertues, deser∣ued both Ho∣nour and Dig∣nity from this vnparalel'd Empresse; who as she was a true aduancer of Vertue, and destroyer of Vice, did libe∣rally bestowe her Royall gifts of Ho∣nour vpon those and their Ance∣stors.

 knowing the Fame of this He∣roicke Empresse to be no lesse deare vn∣to you, then your Illustrious Persons are carefull to propagate to all Posteri∣ties, your cleere and vntainted Names, which by your pious liues, and religi∣ous

conuersations, you haue engrauen in the Temple of Eternity: your ver∣tues cannot but cherish this History, which containes the life of so match∣lesse a Queene, whose Diuine perfecti∣on the whole world admired, as one who was the perfect Patterne of Prin∣cesses, and the true Mirour & Honour of Virgin-kinde. I confesse, many (far better able then I a Stranger) could haue discharged this Enterprise with far more skill, and both in smoother and more elegant termes, if they had beene willing to honour their Labours and Industries with so rare and worthy a Subiect. But howsoeuer, I was willing the best I was able, to pay this my hum∣ble Duty to Her blessed Memory, and to your Honorable selues, by my poore endeuours to make knowne the desire I haue to intitle my selfe,
