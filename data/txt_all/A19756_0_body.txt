RIGHT HONORABLE:
AS all Vertue findes both originall and perfection in Chri∣stian Religion; so e∣specially Gratitude: that if I would deliuer in a word,

what our Profession teaches, it should bee this; To bee thankfull: And though my ablest endeauor, assisted with most fauourable ac∣ceptance, can neuer render mee more then willing to deserue the greatnesse of your H: bounties; yet if I onely of many my Bre∣thren (as who knowes your Ho∣nor truly, but must confesse you a Father of our Nation) come back with the Samaritane to make pub∣lique acknowledgement as it can no way take from the constancie of your goodnesse, so it addes this benefit to mee, that I haue some testimony of my desire to pay, as I haue many witnesses of my debt. Not to trouble your Lord∣ship

with much, as the wisdome of Kings best appeares in their ele∣ction of Vicegerents and Coun∣sellors: An example where of wee haue in Salomon and his Sonne Ro∣boam, 1 King. 12. So the Lord grant in preferring such Religious and truely Honourable Personages as your Lordship, to the seat of Iu∣stice, we his Maiesties loyall Sub∣iects may euer continue to ad∣mire his high Iudgment, and dai∣ly blesse the Lord for him.
