BEyng persua∣ded, that at this pre∣sent the lyght of the trouthe dooeth more flourishe here amon∣gest vs in Englande, than elswhere thoroughout the whole world, and seyng the fruite of our wor∣kes rather to empayre than amende, mi∣schiefe to grow and vertue to decaie, co∣uetousenesse to reigne where godlinesse is professed, and of euerie other thyng the contrary to haue place, of that whi∣che shoulde be auoyded: me seemed I could no lesse doe, than reason with my selfe, what all these thing{is} shuld meane. And findyng in conclusion, that they,

whiche knowe reason, can not yet rule theim selfes by reason: me thought it necessarie to publisshe vnto the worlde this little woorke, that I haue scraped out of the dust: Not thynkyng therby to obteine redresse of al men, but in hope that some vertuous myndes beholdyng here as in a glasse, the spottes of theyr owne vices, shall yet the rather bende theyr hertes towardes charitee and con∣tempt of these worldely vanitees. And because I haue founde so muche negli∣gence in man, that almost he deserueth not to be warned any more of his folie: therfore did I determine to dedicate my boke vnto a woman, to proue whether it maie take any roote in theim: to the entent that men ashamed, thorough the vertuouse examples of women, maie be prouoked therby to refourme theim sel∣fes, whiche no kinde of admonicion can persuade theim to dooe. And findyng amongest women your Ladiship in ver∣tue and bountee to excelle as the dya∣mant

amongest the iewelles, I thought it my duity to commende it specially vn∣to you. Assuryng my selfe, that the wonderfull qualitees and modestee of your Ladiship shall be a no lesse terrour to theim, that viciousely would re∣pugne this little worke, than the thyng it selfe shall be a per∣suasion to others, that beyng well dispo∣sed, maie ther∣of take oc∣casion to amende theyr lyfes.
