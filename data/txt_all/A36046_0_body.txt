Right Honourable,
I Make bold in this my Humble Address, to take my Rise from the Ʋsual Phrase of the Aegyptian Christians Exoptative of Good Success to such∣like Addresses; and therein I do not only wish warmly from my very Heart, That Almighty GOD would be pleased to Conduct You with Honour and high Reputa∣tion, as His Divine Majesty hath hitherto done, through all the Transitions of Your Life; but also that this Ad∣dress may succeed answerable to Your Ladiships Ex∣pectation, and my Design; which is, To give Your
Honour Information out of the Catena of Dionisius Syrus, Extracted by way of Commentary above Seven Hundred Years since, from near Thirty Authors, Sy∣riack, Greek, and Aegyptian, who writes in Explana∣tion of the Three First, and Three Last Chapters of St. Mathew's Gospel; wherein is Luculently set forth the History of our Saviour CHRIST, concerning his Ge∣nealogy, Conception and Birth, his Flight into Aegypt, his Reduction to Nazareth, his Passion, Death, Cruci∣fixion and Burial, his Resurrection, Actions and Appa∣ritions after Death, &c. Finally desiring Your Lady∣ships Acceptance of this my Dedication, I rest
Right Honourable,
