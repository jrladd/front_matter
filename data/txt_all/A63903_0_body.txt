My Lord,
I Do humbly Dedicate this disqui∣sition to your Lordship, after some small, though very Hearty endeavours, to let your Lordship and the World see how extreamly sensible I am of your goodness to me, not only out of a principle of gratitude, but interest too, in gratitude I was ob∣liged
 to bethink my self of a present more suitable to your Lordships de∣served Character and Greatness, than any I have yet had the hardiness or opportunity to make; and in in∣terest, I considered with my self, that having engaged with so potent adversaries as the memory of Mr. Selden, who was the glory of the last Age, and the living fame of a Per∣son yet in being, it concerned me to look out some Patron of the Highest Quality and the most universally ac∣knowledged merit, to give some coun∣tenance to my undertakings, which are intended purely for the discovery of truth, and for the benefit and ad∣vantage of the World.
I have in this Essay given a deadly blow to the Rabbinical Learning, not that I pretend or would be thought to suggest, as if they were not to be believed in any thing they say, for who is so guilty of mistakes and im∣positions
 as not to speak truth some∣times? But if by virtue of a pretend∣ed Tradition, they shall impose any falsity upon us, as I have proved in this Treatise, they have done very many, we are not to believe any thing upon account of any such precarious Tradition, without other circumstances and probabilities to vouch it, as a witness of crackt credit and profligate reputation, may yet put new wait in∣to the Scale of Truth, if he have ei∣their other circumstances or more al∣lowable testimony to concur with him, but upon his own account he is no∣thing, and if any have a mind to sup∣port the credit of the Rabbins, it is not to be done by proving that in some things they have been in the right, but that they are so in those parti∣culars, wherein I have laid falshood and forgery to their charge.
If Mr. Selden were alive, I should not despair but he would acknowledg his Error and that of those upon whose
 authority and credit he depended, but of the other I have no other hope, then only that he will not pretend in scriptis to confute me, though he may possibly whisper in the dark, where I can neither hear nor see him, and may have a party in the Coffee-house to stand by him.
But not content barely to have con∣futed these two Learned Gentlemen, I have substituted positive and affir∣mative Doctrines in the room of those which they would have obtruded upon us, I have, I hope, held out a Key to the Learned World, by which the most difficult passages in the Law of Moses may be explained, and have besides given so fair an entrance into the Antiquities of Rome, and shown so plainly their dependance upon those of the East, from whence they are un∣questionably derived, that it is clearly a new sort of Learning scarce ever yet so much as pointed at by any, and ca∣pable of very great and very usefull
 improvements, all which I do humbly submit to your Lordships known Can∣dor, and unbyast Judgment, and with my most earnest Prayers to Almighty God for the continuance of your Lord∣ships health and safety, in which that of the publick hath so great a share, I am, may it please your Lordship,
