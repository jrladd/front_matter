SIR,
I Should look on my self as justly expos'd to the Cen∣sure of the World, if be∣fore a Treatise of so serious a Nature, and such Important Consequence, I should prefix any thing that looks like Flattery, either of You, or of the Honoured Lady, the
Relation of whose Discourse with Your Deceased Brother, in his last Sickness, is here an∣nex'd. How much You rec∣kon'd Your self indebted to Her for that Instance of her Friendship, I have heard You acknowledge with great Thankfulness.
You have reason to own the singular Goodness of God, who gave him so Merciful a Sea∣son of Repentance, and his Grace, (as we charitably hope,) to make use of it to better purpose than most late Penitents do. I endeavour'd to be Faithful to him while he liv'd; and to fulfil his De∣sire after his Decease, in what
was Preach'd, and is now more largely Publish'd. May neither You, nor I, lose the Impressions of this Instructive Providence, or of that Awful Subject, it led me to treat of! If no Others should profit by either, I wish with all my Heart, and most earnestly beg it of God, that You and Yours may.
Sir, I shall only put You in mind with what Kindness and Affection he sent for Your Children a little before his Death, and recommended to You, and my Sister, a parti∣cular Care of their Educati∣on in the Knowledge and Fear of God; and mention'd it
with Pleasure, that they were like to have that Advantage. May both of them live to have it, and improve it! to Ho∣nour God in the World, and partake of the Blessings of the Everlasting Covenant! And may All mine do so like∣wise! Which is the Earnest Prayer of him, who is with unfeigned Respect,
SIR,

London, May ult. 1700.
