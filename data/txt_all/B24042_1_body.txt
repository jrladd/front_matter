SIR,
I Have been a long time obliged by a continued series of your Favours, and such as would naturally, and irresistibly suggest the thoughts of gra∣titude to any one, that has not debauch∣ed those Principles of Reason, and Ju∣stice, which are common to all Men; and I cannot with any satisfaction live
involved in so great a Debt without an attempt to make some grateful returns. And when I have this opportunity to make a publick acknowledgment of those Obligations, by which I have plainly lost the Title I had to my self, and come under your commands, I dare not be guilty of that silence, by which I must seem either insensible, and no Man, or ungrateful, and the worst of Men. I must own it as one of the kindest Providences of Heaven, that I had the happiness, Sir, not only to be directed in my Studies by you, but by your particular favour to injoy ma∣ny other great, and extraordinary ad∣vantages, to all which under the Al∣mighty God I owe what I may pretend to in Physick. I do therefore as an ex∣pression of that Respect, and Gratitude, which are due from me, humbly present you with these Discourses, and although I shall never be able to satisfie that Debt, which I have contracted, yet this will
be a demonstration of my inclinations to be Just, and Grateful. And there is no one can be insensible, how far I I am in Justice bound to render to you that, which is an account of the Ta∣lent, which you, Sir, have intrusted me with, and so far as I am capable taught me to improve.
What entertainment these Discourses will find in the World I know not. I cannot have so foolish an opinion of my self, or them, as to think they are free from those imperfections, which will betray the weakness of their Au∣thor, and perhaps there are some things, which Candor it self cannot overlook. However the security I shall have from your Patronage, gives me the prospect of a more kind, and candid reception, than they can deserve. Which I must in∣genuously acknowledg carries so much of an Obligation in it, that whilst I am en∣deavouring to discharge one Duty, I am
sensible I contract a fresh Debt. Thus in the very expressions of my Devotion to your service I meet with Arguments, which confirm my resolutions to be,
Sir,
