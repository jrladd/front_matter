My Lord,
I Have so deep a sense of those manifold
and great Favours which through the
course of many years without interrup∣tion
it hath pleased your Lordship to confer
upon me, That though I know it is impos∣sible
for me to make any proportionable re∣turn,
yet it is equally impossible for me to
omit any opportunity of making my just ac∣knowledgments.
And forasmuch as my obli∣gations
to your Lordship are as well known
to the World as great in themselves, I think it

becomes me, and am persuaded all men (but
your Lordshp) expect it from me, that I should
make some publick expression of my gratitude.
I will therefore do that right to my self
to acknowledge, that when I first deliberated
about the adventuring these Papers to the
Press, it was a principal argument to deter∣mine
me so to do, because by the Dedicati∣on
of this part of my Studies to your Lord∣ship's
Name, I should have opportunity of
performing so just a duty, and of doing ho∣nour
to so great Vertue and Goodness.
But, my Lord, I must needs confess,
that when I came to make reflection upon the
Subject, and the tenour of the present Dis∣course,
I was quickly sensible how great an
errour my zeal was likely to betray me into,
in Intitling a work almost wholly levelled a∣gainst
debauchery, to a Personage of so se∣vere
Vertue and Sanctity; for I considered
your Lordship's early, as well as eminent and
habitual Piety, and what need (thought I)
is there of Physick to those that are in

perfect health? and if as S. Paul asserts, The
Law is not made for a Righteous man, because
such are able to be a Law to themselves; much
less is the Doctrine of Repentance suitably
Preached to those that (in the words of our
Saviour) need no Repentance: Thus I felt a
conflict within my self, my discretion opposing
the designs of my gratitude, and my present
reason staggering my former resolution.
But then, my Lord, I considered also on
the other hand, that seeing the Divine Ma∣jesty
himself is well pleased with those Ob∣lations
that are beneficial to the World
though they are not usefull to himself, nor
make any addition to his own glory and
happiness; I could not doubt but your Lord∣ship
who hath so great a zeal to the common
good of mankind, would permit your Name
to be made use of to countenance a design
of bringing men home to God, to themselves,
and their own happiness; and of recovering
the Age from the mischiefs of extravagancy
and debauchery, which it too lamentably
groans under.

And this, my Lord, re-fixed my resoluti∣ons
to Intitle your Lordship to this plain
Piece of Practical Divinity; and so much
the rather, because it is reasonable to hope,
that the directing men's eyes and thoughts to
so great and rare an Example of clear and
unspotted Vertue, amidst all the disturbances
of business, and the temptations of a plenti∣full
fortune, will be able to confute all their
objections against the possibility of hero∣ick
goodness; and may have as much effica∣cy
to convince and shame them out of their
follies, as the very reason of this Discourse
to incourage their amendment.
And should I now, as well in pursuance
of the design of my Book, as of my gratitude,
make a draught of your Lordship in your full
proportions; that is, endeavour to represent
you as great as your own Vertues added to
the Nobility of your Bloud have made you,
I might (if my skill failed me not) exhibit
to the World a piece of that Masculine per∣fection
wherein the most curious would not

know what to desire, nor the most envious
what to suspect. Forasmuch as not only
this whole Kingdom, and that of Ireland,
but several of the Neighbour States and
Kingdoms also, can bear witness to your
Lordship's steadiness in the Protestant Re∣ligion;
your Loyalty to your Prince, your
Piety, Humanity, Justice, Temperance,
Prudence, Courage, and all other great and
Illustrious Ornaments.
Nor do I fear by such a Character to de∣rive
any envy upon your Lordship, since
very few of your Lawrels were the meer
Favours of Fortune, but tht Rewards of
Vertue, the Acquests of Prudence and
Conduct, and won by Wise Counsels, by
Generous Resolutions, and Noble Employ∣ments;
and in such a case it is to be hoped
that Men will not have the Impudence to En∣vy
the Effects, when they have not the Bra∣very
to Imitate the Causes.
Thus my Lord, I could satisfy my own
Conscience and do right to the World, in

setting before them such a Pattern as would
at once inflame the Generous, and shame
the Slothfull and Vicious. But I know
your Lordship's Temper, and the Greatness
of your Mind too well to think, that hereby
I should do an Acceptable Service to your
Lordship; wherefore I add no more but my
Hearty Prayers, that it will please Almigh∣ty
God to Bless your Lordship, and your
most Noble and Pious Countess with long
Life and Prosperity, to succeed your Lord∣ship's
Studies and Endeavours, to the benefit
of Religion, your Prince and Countrey,
and to preserve your hopefull Off-spring
that they may Uphold your Family, Name
and HOnour to after Generations. This
my Lord, is the Constant Duty, and shall
be the Incessant Desire of
My Lord,
