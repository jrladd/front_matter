SIR,
AT length the WAR, which has been carry'd on for so many Years, with such Expence of Blood, and Treasure to the Nation, is at an End; and
we have the fairest prospect imagi∣nable of a lasting PEACE, and a happy Settlement under the Go∣vernment of a Prince, who after He has employ'd His Arms abroad with so much Success for the De∣fence of our Liberties; will, we hope, turn all His Councils to the finishing so Glorious a Design, and be as Renown'd to future Ages, for the Peaceful Arts of Government, as for His Military Virtues: As His Courage has made us Safe, so His Wisdom, undoubtedly, will make us Rich and Happy, by the improvement of our Navigation, and the increase of our Trade: For 'tis to Trade we owe the Rise and Progress of the English Greatness, that has enabled us to support so te∣dious a War against the most formi∣dable Power which has been known in Europe for these many Ages, and that alone can enable us to discharge the vast Debts we have
contracted by the WAR. Trade being of such mighty Consequence to the Interest of the Nation, will, we hope, meet with due Encourage∣ment and Protection from our Laws, and will be settled under the ablest Management, and the wisest Regu∣lation. These Branches of our Com∣merce which have been impair'd or lost by the Piratick WAR, and the fatal Interruption of our Navigati∣on, may be retriev'd by the PEACE, and other Trades, and particular∣ly that with France, which the Negligence, or the mistaken Coun∣sells of the last Reigns had fetled upon a Foot so distructive to our Interest, may be establish'd to our Advantage in a new Treaty of Com∣merce. The great Trade to the East-Indies with some few Regula∣tions, might be establish'd upon a Bottom more consistent with the Manufactures of England; but in all Appearance, this is not to be
compass'd, unless some publick spirited Man with a Masterly Ge∣nious be plac'd at the Head of out Affairs in India; and though we who are his Friends, are loath to loose him, 'twere to be wish'd, for the Good of the Kingdom, that the Gentleman whom common Fame, and the Voice of the World, have pointed out as the ablest Man for such a Station, would employ his excellent Judgment and Talents that way, in the Execution of so usefull a Design.
The general Interest of a Na∣tion, ought to be the Care of par∣ticular Men, the main bent of their Studies, and the chief Pursuit of their Inquiries: Every Man ought to set his helping Hand to such a a Work: And your own generous Labours upon this Subject, have set an excellent Pattern to the rest of the World. To this End I pre∣sent
you with a Translation of this Discourse of Xenophon upon the Subject of Revenue and Trade, and I fancy it will be no unwelcome Entertainment to you, to find your own admirable Observations upon these Matters; confirm'd by the Au∣thority of one of the greatest Men that ever Antiquity produc'd, and the only ancient Author upon this Subject, which is now extant. You will admire the Force and Solidity of his Observations, the Exactness of his Calculations, the justness, and freedom of his Thoughts, not confin'd to the narrow Notions of Parties and Factions, and the vi∣gour of his Judgment and Elo∣quence at so great an Age. The general Rules for the Increase of Riches and Trade, are either di∣rectly advanc'd, or may be very naturally deduc'd from this Dis∣course. That admirable Maxim That the true Wealth and Greatness of a
Nation, consists in Numbers of People, well employ'd, is every where incul∣cated throughout the whole Course of the Treatise. And I believe Xenophon was the first Author that ever argu'd by Political Arithme∣tick, or the Art of Reasoning up∣on things by Figures, which has been improv'd by some able Heads of our own Nation, and carry'd to the highest Perfection by your own successful Inquiries.
As for what relates to my Trans∣lation, I have rather chosen to ren∣der the Sense and Meaning of the Author, than his Words, or his Manner: The Purity, Politeness, and the unaffected Simplicity of his Stile, are Graces not to be copy'd by the Barrenness and Barbarity of our Modern Languages.
I hope the Translation is faithful, and exact; if there are any Mistakes,
I desire the candid Reader to forgive them: I have added some Histori∣cal Notes at the End, to explain some Difficulties relating to the Law and Customs of the Grecian People. I am,
SIR,
