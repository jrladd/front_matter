My Lord,
I Did some years
past, present you
with a plain rela∣tion
of the life
of Mr Richard
Hooker, that humble man, to
whose memory, Princes and the
most learned of this Nation have

paid a reverence at the mention of
his name—And, now with Mr.
Hookers I present you also, the
life of that pattern of primitive
piety, Mr. George Herbert;
and, with his, the life of Doctor
Donne, and your friend Sir Hen∣ry
Wotton, all reprinted.—The
two first were written under your
roof: for which reason, if they
were worth it, you might just∣ly
challenge a Dedication. And
indeed, so you might of Do∣ctor
Donnes, and Sir Henry
Wottons: because, if I had
been fit for this Undertaking, it
would not have been by acquir'd
Learning or Study, but by the ad∣vantage
of forty years friendship,

and thereby the hearing of and
discoursing with your Lordship,
which hath inabled me to make the
relation of these Lives passable in
an eloquent and captious age.
And indeed, my Lord, though,
these relations be well-meant Sa∣crifices
to the Memory of these
Worthy men: yet, I have so little
Confidence in my performance, that
I beg pardon for superscribing
your name to them; And, desire
all that know your Lordship, to ap∣prehend
this not as a Dedication,
(at least, by which you receive any
addition of honour;) but rather,
as an humble, and a more publick

acknowledgment of your long con∣tinued:
and, your now daily Fa∣vours
of
My Lord
Your most affectionate
and
most humble Servant
