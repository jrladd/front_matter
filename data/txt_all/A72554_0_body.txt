MAy it please your Lordships, that whereas you granted your Commission vnto Cap∣taine Robert Gorges, Gouer∣nour of New England, Cap∣taine Fraunces West, my selfe, and the Gouernour of New-Plimoth, as Coun∣sellers with him, for the ordering and Gouer∣ning of all the said Terretories, wherein wee haue ben diligent to the vttermost of our po∣wers, as we shall be ready to render an account vnto your Honors, when you shall be pleased to require vs thereunto. In the meane time, I thought it my dutie to present vnto your viewes, such obseruation as I haue taken, both of the Countrey and People, Commodities
& Discommodities: as also, what places are fit to settle Plantations in, in which not, what courses ate fit in my vnderstanding to bee ta∣ken, for bringing Glory to God, Hounour to our King & Nation, good vnto the Commō∣wealth, & profit to all Aduenturers and Plan∣ters: which I humbly beseech your Lordships to accept of, as the best fruits of a shallow ca∣pasitie: so shall I thinke my time and charge well imploied, which I haue spent in these affaires.
I haue omitted many things in this my discourse, which I conceiued to be Imperti∣nent at this time for me to relate, as of the time of my being at Sea, of the strange Fish which wee there saw, some with wings fly∣ing aboue the water, others with manes, eares and heads, and chasing one another with o∣pen mouths like stone Horses in a parke, as al∣so of the steering of our Course, the obserua∣tion of the Sunne and Starres, by which the e∣leuation of the Pole is found, the degrees of latitude knowen, which shews how far a ship is out of his due course, either to the North or South: likewise of the making of the land at our arriuall vpon the choast of New-England,
how it did arise and appeare vnto vs: how e∣uery Harbour beares one from another vpon the point of the Compas: and what Rockes and dangers are in the way: how many fa∣thom water is found by sounding at the en∣trance of euery Harbour: and from how ma∣ny of the seuerall winds all the Harbours are land locked. But by this meanes I thought I should not only be tedious, but also be in dan∣ger of loosing my selfe, for want of fit phraises, and sound iudgement, in the Arts of the Ma∣thematickes and Nauigation, (being but a young Scholler, though an ancient trauiler by sea) and therefore thought better to omit those, then any thing I haue relate.
Thus beseeching God to blesse your Ho∣nors. I rest at your Lordshippes seruice.
