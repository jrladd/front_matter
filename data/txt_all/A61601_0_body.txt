May it please Your Highness,
HOW deeply the Design was laid, and with what Violence carry'd on by those who lately Steer'd the Helm of this State, for the Subversion of the Establish'd Religion and Government of these Three Kingdoms, is already sufficiently well known to Your Highness. Among the rest, one of their Chiefest Contrivances was, by a Malicious, and Illegal Prosecution, to have extinguish'd the Brigthest Luminaries of the English Church; to the end, that the benighted People might the more easily, after that, have been misled into the Pitfals of Superstition and Slavery.
But as Heaven began their Disappoint∣ment, in eluding both at once there Subtilty and Malice, by the speedy Deliverance of the Seven Renowned Sufferers, from the Jaws of their Oppressors; So the utter Dissolution of their Arbitrary Command, and Domineering Power, under the Conduct of the same Pro∣vidence, was fully Compleated, Great SIR, by Your Deliberative Prudence, and Un∣daunted Courage.

To Your Illustrious Highness, therefore the Oblation of these Sheets, containing an exact Accompt of the Prosecution, and Tryal of those Heroick Prelates, is most justly due; as being That, wherein Your Higness may, in part, discern the Justice of the Cause You have so Generously undertaken; and that it was not without Reason, that the En∣glish Nation so loudly Implor'd Your timely Assistance. A clear convincement, that it was not Ambition, nor the desire of spacious Rule; but a Noble, and Ardent Zeal for the most Sacred Worship of God, which rows'd Your Courage, to rescue a Distressed Land, whose Religion, Laws, and Liberties, were just ready to have been overwhelm'd with French Tyranny, and Romish Idolatry.
Therefore, that the Nation may long con∣tinue under the Protection of Your Glori∣ous Administration, is the Prayer of,
Great SIR,
