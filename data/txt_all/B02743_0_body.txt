THE horrible fierce Discordances, and intestine Civil Wars of Christian Princes, had reduc'd me (most noble Cardinal) to this condition, That being despoyl'd and plundered of all Estate, bound in Chains, and haled thorow the Moun∣tainous & dangerous Passages
of Thracia and lesser Asia, dragged about from place to place, like horse unto a Mar∣ket, I became seven times sold to the sundry and toylesome sorts of rustick labors; where under an heavy Turkish rod, & sharper provocations, in hun∣ger and thirst, in cold and na∣kedness, exposed to all open∣ness of Airs, I was compell'd to attend the feeding Sheep, Goats, and all other sorts of Cattel, and oftentimes to ex∣ercise their discipline of war. For prevention therefore of a lasting misery, I endeavoured an escape; and wandering up and down, guided by the Nor∣thern
Pole, sustaining Life with Acorns, wilde herbs, and their bitter roots, sodden with a little salt, I spent my time in solitariness, amidst even ra∣vening Beasts; till at length, having fastned together some few Timber pieces with cords and wythes, I ventured to pass the Hellespontick Sea; but was retaken, and brought back again unto my Master; where tyed both hands and feet, and prostrated on the ground, I was most cruelly and severely scourged and threshed; and after, for the space of thirteen yeers, tossed and tumbled on the waves of
a sad and adverse fortune un∣der the Turkish Government. I endured and suffered many miseries, calamities, afflicti∣ons, and persecutions for my Religions sake.
But when I had found by sad exprience, that the for∣mer more compendious way through Thrace, could not free me from their Tyranny, and grievous Slavery, I resolv∣ed to steer another course by observation of the Southern Pole, to pass the Desarts and perillous places of Caramania and Syria: and so through many and various difficulties, I at length arrived in the holy
Land, and was received by the Brethren of Saint Francis of Jerusalem inhabiting Mount Sion: from whence, after the refreshment of a yeer, as a man revived from death, (by God's Almighty providence) and as snatched from the claws of the hellish Dragon, & freed from those cruel tor∣tures, I return'd home amongst my Christian Friends, a true witness of the Turkish cruel∣ties; that they with due repen∣tance for their sins and errors, might learn to avoid like cru∣cifyings and tortures; and likewise understand what high degree of hate those men
deserve, whose foul ambitions stop and hinder the employ∣ment of Christian swords from destructing and abolishing that Satanick-Turkish Go∣vernment, which may (by God's assistance) be the only preventor of our future mi∣series; and which hath been long-since, and propheti∣cally spoken of, both by Chri∣stians and Infidels.
Therefore having finished a large perambulation of the holy Land, and visited good part there of the West, and de∣scribed rudely the Tragedy of their cruelties, together with other circumstances of that
Government, all which I ga∣ther'd from daily conversati∣on, experience, & long practise in Courts and Camps of the Turkish Emperour; and what more I could ever learn from ratiocinations with wise and experienced men, or by read∣ing, I committed stil to memo∣ry, and at several times & stati∣ons, remitted them to writing, and made them after publick; which divers learned and so∣ber persons translated into their several Idiomes: which when I found, and perceived they might prove necessary, or somewhat useful, & favour∣ably accepted by the Reader,
I recollected them, and bound them up into this little bun∣del, and have dedicated the whole unto your Grace, the best of Patrons, printed in this famous City, Rome, receptacle of all Natoins, to be difpersed to all Friends and Strangers.
Do you therefore by the ex∣ample of our Saviour Christ, who preferred the poor Wid∣dows mite, before the gifts of Princes, & with that purchased the inheritance of immortali∣ty, favourably & in good part accept of this poor oblation, from
