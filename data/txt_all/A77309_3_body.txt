THO I rejoice in your Love to the Truth in Christ, I wonder at God's rich Mercy, that inâˆ£clineth you to encourage my preaching it, which (alas!) savoureth so much of the poor Earthen Vessel. O that I gave you more cause to own me! as I do own your over-honouring me. May the Lord be in all our Meetings of a Truth! May you long continue great Blessings to me, and to the Church of Christ! May I in some measure serve the Lord, and (under him) you, and others: who am, dear Sirs,
