Right Honourable,
TIS not the Excellence of the Discourse but its Honest Design that emboldens the Author to Prefix Your Name to it. The Death of Charles the First (of ever blessed memory) was too Cruel a Blow to these Nations not to be seriously Lamented. The Doctrines in those days Preach'd, and now Re∣viv'd to encourage Schism, Faction and Rebel∣lion, too Hellish not to be oppos'd by all who have any sense of Christianity, to Condole the one, and to stay the Progress of the other, this Sermon was Preacht: what its success may be I know not, but if it serve to undeceive any who have
been seduced from their Duties to their Prince, or their Church-Governours, my good Intentions will be highly recompensed. Your Honour who is so Eminent an Assertor of Majesty, and the Re∣ligion of the Church of England as by Law Established, has obliged your self, in some measure, to Protect the meanest Person who sincerely in∣tends the same thing, Among whom I hope Your Honours Charity will place me, and on that Ac∣count favourably Patronize the mean endeavour of
My Lord,
