Gentlemen,
ALthough I am a stranger to you, I must de∣clare to the world that what I know in this Art Military, I received, as it were from your breast; from some who were Leaders in your ground: And 'tis a grief to me that I live at such a distance from you, as not to be of your num∣ber; the least amongst you being of ability to be Commanders in Chief, when ever his MAJESTY may require it. There is in you strength enough to shield a just cause; and a Royal cause is able to advance your power: give me leave to tell you there can be nothing done by you without it; it is that which giveth strength and sinewes, to all your motions.
Gentlemen, you may see, by my other Epistles, what Authors I have made use of,Elton. and if you find some of the words of Command, one and the same with others late before me, I could not help it, for this was finished as to the Commands and di∣rections above four or five years now last past, and in
 all that time I never saw any thing of the Gentle∣mans, nor his latter piece as yet.
This you'l find to be but methodical collections for the young Country Souldier; and in our rural ex∣ercises they can draw up but twelve files, in which I am stinted to a very small number for so great a work; if there were a proportionableness in the Armes, the figures would have been better; yet not in the least presuming to teach you; but I hope with your fa∣vourable constructions you will allow it useful for us in the Country, although your abilities may teach the world ten times more. I aim'd at nothing but to shew how necessary the readyness and use of Armes is, and of men to be well exercised in them. Which hath been a benefit to Republicks, as History and experience hath made to appear; for what Nation hath not found safety in the expert use of them, and in the neglect thereof ruin?
I hope there are none of you so disloyal, as not to obey your Princes Commands; in Order to which I cannot but Commend your close order to his Re∣ligion, (and not to be at open distances); it is that which will make your obedience free, your affections settled, your selves renowned, and as I may in some part say, the peace of the Kingdom secured.
I humbly crave your pardons for my boldness, and grant me not only to be in the number of the well wishers to this Art, but also to the prosperity of your ground, and I shall alwayes subscribe,
March, 1671.
