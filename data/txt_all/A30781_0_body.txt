SIR,
THough a Stranger to your Person, 'tis impossible to be so to your Virtues; for General Fame (that is so often call'd a Lyar, and seldom takes pains to Bla∣zon Good Deeds, but on the cóntrary is most in∣dustrious to expose the Bad) has taken an unusual and peculiar Care to Justify your Reputation; And the united consent of all Mankind concur, that in your Character she has spoke Truth, and what is as commendable, no more than the Truth.
Your Generous Charity in many considerable Extremities, has sufficiently demonstrated, not on∣ly the Ancient Spirit of an English Man, but the more glorious Principle of a Christian. Charity the eldest Favourite of God, the first in Honour, and the last in Love, seems to be declared the Heir of all your Fortunes: It is your Private Plea∣sure, your Secret Ambition, the Care of your En∣deavours, and I cannot help saying, the Blessing that attends 'em.
Your Noble Commiseration on the Deplorable Condition of many a wretched Soul in the Hard Frost must be remembred, when Corn and Goals were above their reach, and, indeed, so dear, that it would have been counted Impudence, in the greatest necessity, to have begg'd 'em; You, like a second Ioseph, in the Famine, reliev'd their wants, and gave 'em Fire to warm the Hearts you fed.
Your most Commendable Bounty to the distres∣sed Irish Protestants must be remembred, for you were their greatest Benefactor, and the First. Such Publick Benevolence ought not to be conceal'd, tho' 'tis your desire; for you would be as well pleas'd to have it not known, as you are satisfied when you bestow it: But I say again, it ought to be Publish'd out of the hopes that the knowledge of such Goodness may rouze the sleeping hospita∣lity of our Land, that it may take place of Board Wages, which has scandalously shut up those Doors our Grandfathers always kept open for the Poor.
It is not to be expected that my Pen should set forth your Praise as the merit of it deserves, but as the famous Sir Godfrey Kneller, in a Choice Picture will strike the Eye of the Beholder (tho' a Stranger to the Original) and tell him, some where or other he has seen that Face, tho' he cannot immediately re∣collect the Person: So I will endeavour by the bold touches of Truth, to let the World know they have heard of the Man, tho' they cannot at the instant apply the Character to his Name.
So Famous a Citizen has not in many Ages fill'd the Walls of London; your Generosity is the Ho∣nour of it, your Conduct and Affability the Cre∣dit of it; And you are one of the chiefest Mem∣bers in the support of its Trade.
'Tis probable that the World may admire at a Dedication of this Nature to Sir Thomas Cooke, since the Custom of Poets has been to Address their Plays to the Nobility, either by the way of Thanks, for Patronizing their Works before they were made publick; or else in a Panegyrick on their Families: But I declare, neither of these are the oc∣casion of this Epistle; but that it proceeds from a real respect I have to your great Character, and a desire of being the first that should Publish it to the World.
The Romans whose Courage and Country once excell'd all others, were ever proudest of their Ci∣tizens, and not without good Reason; for indeed they are the support of all Governments: And as they are the first to be Tryed, so they are the long∣est to be Esteem'd, the most to be Encouraged, and the last to be Injured. Anthony reckon'd he had as good as Conquer'd Brutus, when his Oration had overthrown his Interest with the Citizens. That ours may always Flourish, and never want such Virtues as yours to advance their Prosperity, shall be the constant and fervant wish,
