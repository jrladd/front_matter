I Have thought never to interest any in the Protection of my Writings. Divers times when my Genius hath carried me to the Press, I have always slighted Dedica∣tion either as rash, or as superfluous. Great Things are Defences to themselves; nor should Jove be invited to be Patron to a Pigmie. But the Merit of your Excellency, that can excuse the Ambition of any Wit that is covetous his La∣bours should visit the Light under such an As∣cendant of Felicity, hath perswaded me to glo∣rifie my Name, by subscribing it to that of your Excellency; whom I believe the World is too poor of Encomiums to celebrate sufficiently. Be∣hold therefore recommended to the favor of your Excellency, the Princess DIANEA, who
ambitiously runs to humble her self to those Great∣nesses, which provoke Observances even from Princesses themselves. I (in the History of her) have been desirous to try if the Opinion of Philoxenus, that neither Flesh to Flesh, nor Fish to Fish gave a precedency, hath also the same effect in Fable to Fable. May your Ex∣cellency please to receive in the poverty of the gift; the desire of that Hand, that would erect to you Statues of Mountains, and make you Pi∣ctures of the Heavens. Lastly, I most humbly bow to you.
From VENICE the 25 of October, 1635.
