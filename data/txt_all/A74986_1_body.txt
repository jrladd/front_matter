But when I heard the most horrid Blasphemies, and saw the monstrous Heresies that every day new-sprang up, to the high dishonor and displeasure of Almighty God, the re∣proach of his truth, saddening the hearts and dejecting the minds of his people: the enemy in mean space riding in tri∣umph and treading down all before him: Setting aside all doubts and fears, at last I finisht and publisht this small book, partly inclined thereunto to yeeld some account of my late unpleasing leisure; but chiefly, for discharge of my duty, and a double engage∣ment that lay upon me: 1. As a Christian, being all bound, as the Apo∣stle exhorts us, Jude 3. To contend earnestly for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints. 2. As a Mini∣ster of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which we are bound more specially to defend, and not to give place to false teachers, No not for an hour that the truth of the Gospel may continue, Gal. 2.5. Besides the solemn Covenant to extirpate all Heresie, Schism, and Prophaness, and whatsoever is contrary to sound doctrine.

And now (right worshipful) I pre∣sent you with it, such as it is, being en∣gaged also thereunto by the many fa∣vors and kindnesses I have received of you, whereof be pleased to tak this as an acknowledgment.
I hope it may prove some help to discover the manifold sleights and impostures of false Prophets and Decei∣vers that are entered into the world, that privily bring in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them. And many follow their pernici∣ous ways, but my prayers are always for you, that yee may ever escape their snares.
