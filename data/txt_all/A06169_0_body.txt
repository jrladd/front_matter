MAdam your deep and considerate iudgement your ad∣mired honor & happy readings haue drawne me to present this labor of mine to your gracous hands, and fauorable patronage: wherein, though you shall find nothing to admire; yet doubt I not but you may meet many things that deserue cherishing. Touching the subiect, though of it selfe it seeme historicall, yet if it please you like our English Sapho, to look into that which I haue slenderly written, I doubt not but that your memory shal acquaint you with my diligence, and my diligence may deserue your applause. Touching the place where I wrote this▪ it was in those straits christned by Magelan; in which place to the southward many wonderous Isles, many strange fishes, many mon∣strous Patagones withdrew my senses; briefly, many bitter and extreme frosts at midsummer continually clothe and clad the dis∣comfortable mountaines, so that as there was great wonder in the place wherein I writ this so likewise might it be maruelled, that in such scantie fare, such causes of feare, so mightie discouragements, and many crosses, I should deserue or eternize any thing. Yet what I haue done (good Madame) iudge and hope this felicitie from my pen, that whilst the memorie therof shal liue in any age, your cha∣ritie, learning, nobilitie and vertues shall be eternized. Oppian writing to Theodosius was as famous by the person to whome hee consecrated his study, as fortunate in his labours, which as yet are not mastered by obliuion; so hope I (Madame) on the wing of your sacred name to be borne to the temple of Eternitie, where though en∣uie barke at me, the Muses shall cherish, loue, and happie. Thus hoping your Ladiship will supply my boldnesse with your bountie and affabilitie, I humbly kisse your most delicate handes, shutting vp my English duety vnder an Italian copie of humanitie and cur∣tesie. From my house this 4. of Maie 1596.
