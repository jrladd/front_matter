WHen I had fini∣shed the tran¦slation of this Booke (louing Vncle & Aunt) I remembred the common order & custome euer vsed, in so much that few commit their labours to the view of the world, vnlesse they first procure some Patrone for their defence. I therefore, vn∣willing
to send my translati∣on to the presse, before I had committed it to the patro∣nage of some And standing in doubt to whome I might offer my labour in this kind, trusting vpon your curtesies, did embolden my selfe to commende this Treatise to your protections. The booke was written aboue an hun∣dreth and threescore yeares since in the Spanish tongue, the Authour thereof being vnknowne. As for his stile and methode of writing I meane not to commend it, leauing the iudgment there∣of to those, vnto whom such censures are belonging. I for my parte as I haue faithfully englished his words, & deliue¦red his meaning in such mā∣ner that Englishmē may both
read his treatise and vnder∣stand it, so I doo not doubt, but that it wilbe as profitable vnto them that reade it, for their instruction, as it hath beene to other nations who haue greedily desired the trā∣slation hereof. And thus be∣seeching you to take my good will and meaning in good part, I commit you to the tuition of the Almigh∣tie.
