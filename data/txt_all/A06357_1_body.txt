May it please your Grace:
HAuing in the former Booke presented the Banian, with his Er∣rours and Superstiti∣ons to your Cen∣sure: I haue in this second Booke, brought the Persee al∣so to the same Barre, to be arraigned vpon like Guilt. This Superstition of the Persee, as your Grace well knoweth by the Relation of Socrates,

in the seauenth Booke of his Ecclesi∣asticke History. Cap. 8. was much weak∣ned in opinion by one Marutha, Bi∣shop of Mesopotamia, wherein Yesdegerd the last King of these Persees, became so wauering, that the Magies to re∣claime him from Reuolt and vacil∣lancy in the opinion of his holy fire, did conuey one vnder ground, where their liuing fire was kept, that might tell Yesdegerd, that if hee did reuolt from this worshippe, hee should bee deposed from his Rule, and come to a miserable ending: at the hearing of which voyce (conceiued to bee some diuine message) Yesdegerd grew much troubled, till Marutha brought the Imposture to discouery, by aduising Yesdegerd to digge vnder ground, where the feigned Cryer was heard and deprehended in a vault, to the shamefull detection of this close de∣uise▪ To your Grace then I referre the said Persee, with his soyled and

tainted worshippe; hopefull your Grace will be pleased to sentence him to a publique Procession, habilimen∣ted in the ridiculous vesture of his owne Superstitions, that all good minded people vpon view of him, may giue him his demerited shame and defamation. Thus with the humble tender of my seruice to your Grace in these forraigne Collections, and my prayers that you may liue long to doe worthy Acts in Jsrael, I rest,
