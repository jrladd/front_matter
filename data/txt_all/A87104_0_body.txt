Indeed as for my own particular I have far less reason to complain than many others of my Brethren, and those far more deserving than my self; it ha∣ving pleased Almighty God both to restrain my Enemies, and multiply my Friends beyond expecta∣tion.
And truly, next to the infinite goodness of my God (which I desire for ever to celebrate) and the no less faithfull than skilfull endeavours of my wor∣thy Physicians (which I shall alwaies acknowledge) I must attribute my late (almost miraculous) reco∣very,

to the fervent intercessions of my affectionate Friends at the Throne of Grace on my behalf.
To them all I return my hearty thanks, and pro∣mise my daily prayers for them, and more especially for you (my honoured Lady) whom I have reason to esteem as none of the meanest among them, That your health may be prolonged, and your troubles ended, your Children blessed, and your comforts en∣larged; finally, that you may sparkle as a Diamond here in grace, and hereafter shine as a Star in glory, shall be the uncessant prayer of
