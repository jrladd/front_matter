THIS child borne in Spaine your natiue soile, fertile of such worthie wights & Ver∣tuous Imps, being clod in English attyre, though not in Courtlike fasshion, as too too delicate for his graue education & religious pretense; but in or∣dinarie sute, yet well beseeming his inten∣tion, & in no point disagreeing from his parentage; hath ben so bold, incouraged by me his foster-father, as to present him∣self, Right Vertuouse Madame, to your worshipfull seruice: not doubting but that at your deuoute hands he shall receaue such intertainment, as the place from whence he had his beginning, his parents & Allies
so addicted to your self & your noble fa∣milie, and his owne merites doe worthilie deserue. To all which yf I should adde my commendation of him, or my diligence, such as it is and your self may easilie per∣ceaue, in setting him forwards, & directing him to your presence, although it may seeme to manie, as to my self it doth, that it were in a manner to cast water into the sea; yet considering that to so kind & noble a hart, as yours is, and so giuen to pietie and deuotion, my good will to pleasure, and serue yow in this sort, cannot be but acceptable: I doe in the best wise that I am able, commend vnto your worshipfull custodie and protection this gracious in∣fant, to be cherished of yow, as he is worthie. And so desiring Madame to be remembred in your best deuotions, I wish yow all heartie contentment in him that is our true contentment.
