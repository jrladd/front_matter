A Vertuous minde can not bee without hir honor, nor, an
vngratefull spirit without a burthen of Conscience: the first in your selfe is
made manifest to many, the second, in my selfe, I wish not to liue to bee
touched with, but yet, not able to requite those your Honourable fauours that I
haue receiued yet vndeserued, giue mee leaue in this little fruit of my labour,
to present you with this token of my thanckfulnesse, wherein treating onely of
the vile Nature of Ingratitude, I hope not to bee found guiltie in that
offence. And so, wishing you your deâˆ£sert of Honour, of the best mindes, and
the vngratefull, the plague of an vnquiet Conscience, or amendement of their
euill conditions, in continuall prayer for your harts euer Contentment, I
rest.
