Honourable Sirs,
ALthough the many strong endeavours which have of late been used, to take away or unsettle by law the publique maintenance of the setled Ministry of this Nation, have hitherto proved abortive: yet woful experience tells us, that for want of better Lawes for the true payment thereof, that maintenance is, de facto, very much impeached all the Nation over, both in City and Countrey; to the utter undoing of many Ministers, their Wives and Families, whose cries are gone up to Heaven, of which cries this is but an Eccho: For remedy of which crying grievance and op∣pression, the putting of all former Lawes and Ordinances for Tithes in force will not prove a plaister large enough, without better Lawes, as is herein cleerly demonstrated.
Two things (I conceive) will be alledged against the ensuing Disco∣very: The one is, that it teacheth men to defraud in Tything: But the truth is, Tythe-payers, as experience shewes in all places, are not now to learn any of those fraudulent practices, which are grown an Heredita∣ry disease in many Families being propagated from the unrighteous Fa∣ther to the Son.
The other Objection against such Tracts as these, is, That they are
but the voice of Covetousness: But such cavillers are wilfully, igno∣rant: For this cause touching Ministers maintenance is not cause of any private Interest; but a cause which God himself by his Prophets and Apostles hath asserted, and been zealo in, as Scrip he: And the Primitive Fathers  of the Church have cried out against such  Mi∣nisters maintenance; which maintenance hath not onely been asserted by Ministers, who may seem to seek themselves (this Interest of Reli∣gion being mixed with their own Interest▪) But hath been learnedly and zealously asserted by those which have been no Ministers nor Preach∣ers: yet men of Renown for godly wisdome in all Ages, who against their own private Interest have (as their Books declare) asserted, and pleaded in this cause: The Catalogue of their writings I need not re∣hearse, nor tell you, how many Worthies have freely given up their e∣states in Impropriations to advance and increase the liberal and cer∣tain maintenance of Ministers by Tythes: And for further satisfacti∣on to such as shall say that imputation upon this Discovery, I hope they are convinced, that, Robbed People cannot be justly aspersed with Co∣vetousnesse, because they raise a Hue and Cry after Theeves, and cry out for Law and Justice against them, and give evidence against them to the Magistrate, describing their villanies in every Circumstance, which is the chief aime of the following Discourse, which I humbly present to your Honours wise and favourable Construction: And cra∣ving pardon for my boldnesse, in all submission, I remain.
