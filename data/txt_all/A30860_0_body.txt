SIR,
HEre are the Travels of our Italian Gentleman, that you have so long desired to peruse in our Language. It is an ex∣cellent description of that Great Em∣pire that is so near related unto us by Religion, and nevertheless at such a distance from us. I hope it will fully answer your expectation, for you shall find in it most delightful passages, with an exact account of the Man∣ners, Laws, Government, and of all other particulars in the Dominions of Ethiopia, worth the notice of an Inge∣nious

Traveller. It may be that this small Treatise may meet with the ill fortune which such are to expect that thwart or disapprove of grand de∣signs and furtus enterprises. It matters not what aspersions may be raised to darken its Truth, and hinder its appearance and credit; I hope the probability of all the matters▪ related, & that may be also gathered from the place where it was first published, will dissipate all envious vapours, and cause Ethiopia to appear amongst s in its own shape and form. Our Gentleman had committed an act not agreeable to that Judgment that he shews in his writings to publish things of a Kingdom so well known to most parts of Italy, by reason of the conti∣nual correspondency that the Princes of it do entertain by their Factors with the Grand Neguz) had there been any thing in his Relation not re∣al, r untrue. His Book had not found

that universal applause to be twice honoured with the Press, had it not found amongst his Country-men a re∣ception suitable to its worth. Let the ill-natured and pevish minds, that credit nothing but what they see, e∣steem of this I raslation, and of the original as they please; I know Sir, that all sober-minded Persons as your self, will find both Sweetness and Profit in the Reading of it; however I should desire, that you will look upon these labours as a Confirmation of tha Title that I shall alwayes covet, I mean of
Sir,
