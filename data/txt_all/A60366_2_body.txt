Illustrious Sir,
I desire to Dedicate unto Your Highness this my Labour and Work; because you are descended
of that Family which was first pleased to give entertainment and Protection to this Doctrine:
Your Father readily imbrac'd it, Your Brother hath setled a considerable Estate for the Education
of Children in Learning and Piety, and Your Father in Law (the King of Denmark) is a faâˆ£mous
Defender of it also; and lastly, because You too, Great Sir, pursuing with much Glory their
Example, I cannot but be confident, this Work, which I hope will be profitable to many, will be
therefore acceptable to You. May God Preserve Your Highness.
Given the 23 of
March 1555.
