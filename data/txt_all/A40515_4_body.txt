RIGHT WORSHIPFULL;
THere is store of Sermons extant; the Pulpit scarce affordeth more then the Press: neither know I which is more advantageous. The sound of the Word pierceth more; the letter written endureth longer: the voice extendeth but to some few present; the writing to many absent, & the Authour, though dead, yet speaketh. Here are two added to the number, and by the relict of the deceased pre∣sented to the publick view: which I crave leave to honour with your name. Why I do so, I need not give account to the world, which alrea∣die knoweth your worth and deserts; and shall know by this that I acknowledge them: besides my special obligations to you for your favour to
 me, and my son, unknown to the world. Sir, you were willing to have been his Patron whilest he lived, be pleased now to vouchsafe the Patronage of this his Posthumous issue: which I humbly commend to your care, and you, with your vertuous Ladie, to the grace of the Almightie, wishing you both all that little happiness the earth can afford you, and fulness of glorie in heaven,
