IF the Lord du Plessis (most high and mightie Prince) hauing finished this his worke, out of that reuerend and honou∣rable conceit hee had of your Fathers greatnesse, that vnfained loue which true religion wrought in his heart, and that hope he had of his future endeuors to beat downe Antichrist, thought it a sinne, though a stranger, to thinke of any other Patron but himselfe, to whom hee might dedicate these his labours; much more I, his naturall subiect, linked vnto your Highnesse, his naturall sonne, with the same bond, rapt with the same admiration, fed with the same hope, must say, hauing finished these my labours, Cui dicâre debeam ambigere nefas: For the same reasons that moued him, must likewise encorage me; your greatnesse must encourage, because the same, being a Princelie branch sprung from that Royall stocke; your religion must encourage, because the same which your worthie father, and all the Fathers of the Primitiue Church, haue made profession of; your hopefull endeuours must encourage, because the same, for what he conceiues of your Princelie father, the whole world ex∣pects should be performed, if not by his, by your hand. His pen hath made way for your sword, and his peace, if God giue long life, may farther your warres: Glorious be his peace and your warres, and Gods glorie the end of both. His Highnesse can best iudge what is fitting; we can but wish, and if hee haue begged at Gods hands with Hezekiah, That there may be peace in his daies, we all say Amen, and with one voyce we all crie out, Let there be peace vpon Israel: onely we wish he may neuer haue reason to say as Dauid did, I seeke

peace, and when I speake thereof they are bent to warre, they intend mis∣chiefe. And therefore renowmed Prince (leauing your royall father to Gods peace and his owne hearts desire) giue me leaue, though altogether vnwor∣thie in a matter of such moment to aduise, yet to wish with du Plessis, that I may liue to march ouer the Alpes, and to trayle a pike before the walls of Rome, vnder your Highnesse Standard. It was my first profession, oh that it might be my last. The cause is Gods, the enterprise glorious, O that God would be pleased, as he hath giuen you a heart, so to giue power to put it in execution. Jn the meane time (whilest our hopes are in the bud) let me hum∣bly beseech your Highnesse, till my sword may doe you seruice, to accept of the poore endeuours of my vnskilfull penne; and as it hath pleased your High∣nesse, not long since, graciously to protect my sorie labours bestowed vpon Charron his three bookes of Wisedome, so now to pardon my boldnesse, in vndertaking a worke so farre vnbefitting my strength, and to protect my infirmities. The God of heauen euer blesse your Highnesse, and euer defend you from Antichrist and his bloudie designements, that you may liue, and liue long euen in perniciem, to the ruine of him and all his Antichristian rabble, Amen, Amen.
