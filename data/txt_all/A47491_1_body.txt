Honoured SIR,
COnsidering those many and signal Favours that I have received from you (notwithstanding my unmeriting desarts) are too great to be bu∣ried in the Sea of Forgetfulness, without my humble and thankful acknowledgment of the same, so that I have here offered my Mite to be put into your Treasury, (which I do not to add the least Atome to your Worth, but to make these my Junior Labours appear with the better lusture) for the Present is so small that I am dubious of your acceptance, yet although the Lines are unpolisht, the Subject is Divine, because it is an Epitomy of the Coelestial Philosophy of Ptolomy King of Egypt, from whose Ashes I have endeavoured to make a Lixivium which may take off those Spots and Blurs which have defiled the beautious Ʋrania's Face, by the Innovations of Regiomontanus and Argol, and most of onr modern Authors, and yet the thing it self is not new, but is the true genuine Method that was practiced when the Principles

of Artists were not corrupted, and when Princes themselves were well acquainted with the Lan∣guage of the Stars; and because nothing of this na∣ture was ever Printed in the English Tongue, I have at spare hours made this Essay, which I have pre∣sumed to put under your Honour's Protection, your Name being sufficient, but more especially your Verbal Commendation, to give it a better Reception and Esteem among all Persons of Ho∣nour and Eminence, than he that is,
Honoured SIR,
