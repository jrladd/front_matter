SIR,
BEING a Foreigner, and by con∣sequence standing in need of a great Patronage, I presume to beg yours, not only as being a Personage of an Elevated Station, but because you are yet more considerable for your surprizing Penetra∣tion of Mind, and your incomparable Activity and Zeal for the Good of your Country, by which you have merited those Honourable Posts, that you do so worthily fill, and which I have reason to-hope, are but the earnest of greater Ad¦vancements: But the chief Reason why I make bold to trouble your Honour with this Dedication, is, that amongst the many
 Persons of Quality, who have done me the Honour to peruse this Book in Ma∣nuscript, and to testifie their Approbation of it, there was none who did so much encourage me to render it Publick as your self. So that if it be any ways useful to the Nation, as I hope it may, they will be obliged to your Honour for it.
I confess Sir, that my first intention was to Dedicate it to His Majesty, as tending very much to the Glory of Eng∣land, and by consequence of his own Royal Diadem, but the meanness of my present Condition abated my Confidence to sollicit Access to that great Prince, and therefore, Sir, seeing you were always plea∣sed, out of your Zeal to the Publick wel∣fare, to give me a favourable Reception, notwithstanding the narrowness of my Circumstances, I resolved upon this Dedi∣cation to your self, as one of His Majesties most faithful Ministers, which I beg you would accept as a Token of the singular Esteem, and profound Respect of,
Sir,
