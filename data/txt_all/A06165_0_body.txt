EVer desirous (right honorable) to shew my affectionate duty to your Lordship, as well for the generall report of your vertue vniuersal∣ly conceipted in the opinion of all men, as for the natiue place o my birth, whereby I am bounde to affect your honourable father and you for him aboue others, in suspence of this dutifull desire, it fortuned that one M. Thomas Lodge, who nowe is gone to sea with Mayster Candish, had bestowed some serious labour, in penning of a booke called Euphues Shadowe: and by his last letters gaue straight charge, that I should not onely haue the care for his sake of the impression thereof, but also in his absence to besowe it on some man of Honor, whose worthye vertues might bee apatronage to his worke, where vpon taking aduice with my selfe, I thought none more fit then your Honour, seeing your Lordships dis∣position was wholy giuen to the studie of good letters, to be a Mecenas to the well imployed laboures of the

absent Gentleman: may therfore your lordship fauou∣rably censure of my good meaning, in presenting your honour with this Pamphlet, and courteouslye graunt acceptance of his workes and my good will, his labour hath his end, and my desire in dutie rests satisfied, and so humbly praying for your Lordships health and wel∣fare I take my leaue.
