RIGHT HONORABLE,

The method which we obserue herein, is the selfe same with that in our former bookes: and the matter and manner of handling, we commit to the iudgement of your Honors, and of euery godlie and indifferent reader: If our endeauours be as charitably interpreted by others, as they be faithfully intended by vs, we are sure they shall giue offence to none, but satis∣faction to all. And thus nothing doubting but that your Honors will vouchsafe to receiue this testimony of our duty and vnfained loue, we humbly commit you to the gracious protection of Almighty God, beseeching him alwaies to direct and blesse you.
