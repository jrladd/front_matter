Worthy Sir:
I Have in my troubles (among other
things) observed that when the
LordJob 12. 5. deprives a man of the
superfluous things of this life,
Lam. 3. 2. and brings him into distresse,Pro. 19. 7. his friends
and acquaintance are then wanting unto him,
Psal. 38. 11. they stand aloofe,Job 10. 1. and leave him to him∣selfe,
being (in their opinions) in so miserable
a state and condition;Deut. 8. 5. this is the usuall man∣ner
of Gods dealing with those whom he loves,
for by this means,2 Cor. 4. 16. though the outward man
perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
day. But when the Lord is graciously pleased to
Jonah. 4. 6. deliver the party afflicted from his griefe,Psal. 90. 15.
he is exceeding glad, and then hisJob 42. 11. friends
and acquaintance rejoyce with him, and ex∣presse
their love and affections towards him in
a bountifull manner:Psal. 116. 5, 6. this have I (through
Gods goodnesse) knowne by experience, espe∣cially
these latter times:Psal. 5. 12. for many are the
courtesies which I have received from divers

friends,1 Cor. 16. 18 the which I shall ever acknowledge.
But the truth is, the continuance ofPsal. 112. 5. your
great favours, is such a happinesse to me, as I
must needs confesse you are to me more like a
Job 29. 16. father then a friend or master. And there∣fore
an so much the more obliged unto you.
Pro. 18. 24. In testimony thereof, and of the true love
and service I owe you, I humbly dedicate to
you these first fruits of my poore endeavours,
gathered in my aforesaid troubles, (when I
wasJer. 32. 2. shut up in a miserable place from the
delights of the world) out ofCant. 5. 1. the spirituall
garden of Gods Word; wherefore my hope
is you willPsal. 119. 103. relish them so much the better,
and vouchsafe them your kinde acceptance,
though published by so weake an Instrument
as my selfe, whose further endeavours (not∣withstanding)
shall be to doe somewhat more
some other way, that may conduce to the pub∣lique
welfare, as God (theJam. 1. 5. 17. liberal giver of al
good gifts) shall enable me: To whom I com∣mit
both you and all yours, and remaine,

May 18. 1644.
