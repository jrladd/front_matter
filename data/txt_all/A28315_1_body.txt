Right Worshipful,
HAving for many years past had the happiness to be acquainted with your Worship, and having ever found seated in your most Worthy Person, those most ex∣cellent guifts of Knowledge, both in Divine and Moral things; but most especially, that most excellent guift and noble quality of Affability, being a vertue of the greatest Demonstration of true Generosity. We find it Recorded, that this noble Vertue did abound with Anto∣nius the Emperour (called for his wisdom the Philosopher) who would permit the meanest of his Subjects to come un∣to his presence and to converse with him; for which qua∣lity, he was ever held in high esteem, and well beloved: but on the contrary, such who have abandoned this vertue, ill have befell them: I shall instance one Example hereof, In Julius Caesar who so long as he continued affable and loving unto his Subjects they intirely loved him; but when once he lest off this vertue, and fell into pride, they quickly forsook him, altering their good affection of love unto disdain; and shortly after conspired his Death: and would he but have vouchsafed to have read a Note which a me in person delivered him when he went to the Senate, he might for that time have saved his life, there being writ∣ten in it, the whole discovery of the Plot. Sir, I needed not to have mentioned these things, presuming your Wor∣ship is sufficiently acquainted therewith already, as hav∣ing read these Moral Vertues, and Vices: not only in Antonius, and Julius Caesar, but also in many others. Sir, I want words to express the love and good affection I did always bear unto your Worthy Person; having ever found you to be a true lover of such, who were studious in all lawful Arts and Sciences. That which I here pre∣sent

your Worship withal, is not only Astrology, which is the first and chiefest of all Liberal Arts and Sciences; but also the true Astrological way of my many years practice in Physick; for without knowledge in Astrology, it's impossible to be either a Phylosopher or good Physici∣an, for hath the Theory and Practick thereof is derived from Astrology. In all Ages Astrology was ever held in high esteem; the knowledge whereof (as testiieth Jose∣phus) was taught by God himself unto Adam, and from him, unto Posterity; this worthy Author further saith, that he saw the Art of Astrology graven in Stone in Assyria, done by Seth before the Flood: also those Magi∣cians or Wisemen which came to worship Christ, were great Astrologers, without question (next unto Divinity; its the most excellent study in the World; for those who are but me only read in this Art, must needs know, that a mighty and powerful hand hath wrought those wonders which isy en in the Heavens, as the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Panes with their Mions and powerful Ap∣priians upon all suunay Cure. Sir, I know I need an Arguments to perswade you unto the lawfulness o excel ey of this worthy Science, well knowing, that your Worship, as I have already declared, was ever a true  thref: I question not, but that when you have read once hse my Labours, you will not only be the more con∣firmed in your good pinion hereof, but also find somewhat ein which may increase your knowledge in these secret Mysteries. Sir, may these my Writings prove accepta∣ble unto your most Worthy hands, I have obtained the end of my , which was in some measure to Demonstrate the great affection which I did always bear unto your most Worthy Person, and shall ever remain,
