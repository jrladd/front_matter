SIR,
I Have with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction read over your Book, which I find in every part answerable to its Title, viz. A Ra∣tional Account of the Grounds of Pro∣testant Religion. And now I thank you for it, not only as a private favour, but a publick benefit. No sooner had I per∣used it, but I met with a Discourse en∣tituled, Sure-footing in Christianity. And although I have no small prejudice against Books with conceited Titles, yet I was tempted to look into this, because it pretended to contain Animadversions on some Passages in your Book which I had so lately read over. Vpon perusal of which Animadversions, I found that the Author of them had attaqued (and in his own opinion confuted) a page or two in your Book. This drew me on to take a view of his main Discourses; which because they are in great vogue

among some of his own Party, and do with an unusual kind of confidence and ostentation pretend to the newest and most exact fashion of writing Contro∣versie, as being all along demonstrative and built upon self-evident Principles: Therefore I resolved throughly to ex∣amine them, that I might discover (if I could) upon what so firm and solid Foun∣dations this High and Mighty Confi∣dence was built.
But before I had entred upon this undertaking, I met with a Letter from the Author of Sure-footing to his An∣swerer, directing him how he ought to demean himself in his Answer. In which Letter, though there be many things li∣able to great exception, yet because I am unwilling to be diverted from the main Question, I shall not argue with him about any of those matters, only take leave to use the same liberty in mana∣ging my Answer, which he hath assumed to himself, in prescribing Laws to me about it: Therefore without taking any further notice of his Letter, I address my self to his Book.
