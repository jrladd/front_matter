MAY it please your Grace to understand, that wheras at the first by a frind of mine, and after by mine own ex∣perience, I perceived, that the booke insu∣ing was willingly read by divers, for the persuasion that it hath to godlines of life, which notwithstanding in manie points was corruptly set down: I thought good in the end, to get the same published againe in some better manner than now it is come foorth among them; that so the good, that the reading therof might otherwise do, might carrie no hurt or danger withal, so far as by me might be praevented. For this cause I have taken the pains, both to purge it of certain points that carried either some manifest error, or else some other inconvenience with them: and to join another short Treatise withal, to ort those that are not yet persuaded, to join with us likewise in the truth of Religi∣on.

For so to accept of our adversaries la∣bors so much as is good, may I trust bring to passe with some few of them, that them∣selves wil better perceive, that wherin they shal do wel, they may looke to be as readily incouraged by us, as, when they do il, to be admonished, or reprehended either, as the case doth require: and others likewise of their welwillers (yet notwithstanding in this varie from them, that they stand more indif∣ferent in the cause of religion, and mean not otherwise to persist in their opinions, but so far as they think they have reason for them) may so be the rather induced to assure them selves (as the truth indeed is) that wherin they have sufficient warrant for the points that they stand on, they are not in any wise misliked by us, but onlie for those, wherin they have no sufficient groundwork to bear them out. I was also very glad, both that some of them had taken pains in that kind of labor: and that others of their profession were somtimes occupied in reading of such. For wheras by their bookes that are of the Controversies, the readers of them that are before smitted with that kind of infestion, are oft times therby the more intangled in their errors, and more kindled likewise with inordinate heat, against al those that more sincerely hold the Christian faith: by this kind of labor it may fal out, that comming

therby to the fear of God, though but after a corrupter maner, yet therin may they pos∣sibly finde a readie way, first to draw them somwhat on, to a better advisement of their wais; and then after that, to espie their won∣ted errors likewise, and to join with us in the truth of religion. In which course the better to help them, I have added this other Trea∣tise withal; so to bring before their eies, how the case for that matter doth stand be∣twixt us, and how little cause there is for them so much to be afraid of our profession, as some have born them in hand that they ought: trusting withal, that as they do al∣ready agree with us in many points of great importance; so they can be content to con∣descend unto us in the rest likewise, if it may appeer unto them, that in so doing they shal do none otherwise, than as of conscience, and dutie they ought.
Both which bookes when I thought to have praesented unto your Grace, I was for a time staied by this, for that I thought them not a praesent woorthie inough, in respect of my labors therin. But when I did more deeply consider, that I might very wel hope of better acceptance, than the strict woor∣thines of the thing should deserve, I was then fully resolved to be so bold as to prae∣sent your G. with them such as they be: and, for whatsoever wanteth, either in them, or

me, to rest in the good assurance that I have, that your G. wil notwithstanding of your own inclination in good part take them. As also I take it, that I am by good reason indu∣ced so to do, both for that the dignitie of your place in the church of God among us, and mine own special dutie besides, doth of right require it, and much more than it, if mine abilitie might accordingly serve: and the nature of the matter in one principal point is such, as that by a certain kind of ne∣cessitie it leadeth me therunto. For wheras it may be the persuasion of some, that no such work as is at the first so corrupt in it selfe, should be brought foorth to light by any of us, though never so warily we purged it before (wherin notwithstanding there be many good reasons to ground upon, for those that are otherwise minded:) hence is it, that your Graces censure, especially heer in these parts, is of me and others of the same jurisdiction, especially to be regarded, for the place that God hath given you a∣mong us. In which kind of labor, as Castalion first, then also Maister Rogers have done ve∣ry wel, in that little booke of Kempicius, that is called The Imitation of Christ, leaving out the corruption of it, and taking onlie that which was sound: so hath Iohn Baptist Fikler been very bold in wresting that which ano∣ther had written so wel, of the power of the

magistrate over his subjects, and the dutie of subjects to him again, altogither to the establishing of the Popes supremacie, and to animate their own confoederates against their godlie and lawful princes; changing nothing else (to speak of) but those very ti∣tles, and otherwise using the others matter, method, and stile. Nevertheles, as the for∣mer of these examples shew us, how such things may rightly be used: so the other likewise may admonish those that would mislike to have their oversights so holpen, that they had need as much to go about to excuse their own fellows, as to impugn any others therfore, that use their freedom more moderately. As for my selfe, having used my libertie so easily as I have done, altering no more than need required, and doing the same in quiet maner, without any greefe against the Author whosoever it were; or disgrace to his doings (so much as might be, not betraieng the truth:) I am the lesse careful (under the protection of your Gra∣ces censure) either of the censure, or assalts of others, that are more led by affection than reason. To be short, wheras the former of these two bookes calleth men from the love of the world; and the latter likewise, doth cal men from their woonted errors unto the truth: in both these respects, I thought your G. would so much the rather

accept of them. For having had so long ex∣perience of the world as you have, very like∣lihood teacheth, that needs you must grow more and more from the love therof: and it is sufficiently known unto al, that having found this mercie your selfe, to be delivered from the former ignorance, & to be brought to the knowledge of the truth, you have in like sort (in this long course that God hath given you) much called on others to do the like. These bookes therfore that treat of the same, I thought should be the rather wel∣come. And I beseech almightie God, the fountain and giver of al good things, to give you grace so to consider of the one, and to go on forward in the other, as that more and more departing from the love of the world, and more and more performing the work of the ministerie, you bring the former at length to nothing, and make the other a pollished work for the day of the Lord.
