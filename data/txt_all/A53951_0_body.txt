May it please your Grace,
IT is no small part of your Honour, that you are de∣scended of such Noble Ancestors as have been Great and Eminent, both for their Alliance to the Royal Family, and for their continual Fidelity to the Interest of the Crown. He that shall peruse only the History of the Late Rebellion, and the Letters which did pass between his Late Majesty and the Queen, may easily see how Confident that Blessed Prince was of the Loyalty, and how Faithfully he was served all along by the Wisdom, and Courage of your Noble Grand-Father the Lord Sey∣mour, and your Great Ʋncle the Marquess of Hertford, who was the First General of the Kings Forces against the Parliament; and lived to see the happy times of Restitution, and Dyed Duke of Somerset (full of years and Honour) since the Restauration of his present Majesty. But that which greatly addeth to your Honour is, that as you inherit the Titles, so (God be blessed) you inherit the Loyalty of all your Honourable Predecessors: Which I say (My Lord) not by way of Complement, but to do you Justice: And I must beg your Graces Pardon if that Expression seems to Derogate from your Virtue, in ma∣king your Loyalty to be, not a thing of Choice (as all Virtue is) but a Principle cleaving to your very Nature,
 which cannot be overcome. It is this that hath indear'd you to the King; who has given you an Earnest of his Favour, in Reposing in you so Great a Trust, in the North, for Conducting your affairs with so much Judgment and Integrity, assoon as ever Providence brought you to bear such a great Figure in the World. It is this, that has made you to lie so deep in the Hearts, and Affections of Good Men, wbo take Heart and Courage by seeing your Grace to act so in all things like a good Subject, notwithstanding those Temptations which have Mis-led some, whose longer Experience should have taught them Wisdom. It is this (My Lord) which I must crave Leave still to put you in mind of, that above all things you be careful to have a most Tender regard of your Virtue, and to be ever (as you are) Faithful and True to your Prince: For here∣by you will do right to the memory of your Honourable Progenitors, you will maintain your Honour Clean and Ʋnspotted, you will be useful to the King, to the Church, and to your Country, you will be an Honour and Comfort to your Friends, and an Excellent Example to the World. It is for these Ends (My Lord) that I take upon me to present to your Grace this following Discourse, begging your Lordships, Kind acceptance of it, and beseeching God (whose Providence hath been so Gracious to you hitherto) to Guide, Govern and Preserve your self and Noble Con∣sort, and to Bless Both your Graces with the long Happiness of an undivided Heart, and with a Numerous and Flou∣rishing Issue; which is the Hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,
