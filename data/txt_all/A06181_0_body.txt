SVVeete Master Crane, I had not thought at this instant
to haue partaked my passions with the print, whose discon∣tented thoughts so
long in∣ured to obscuritie, were diuorsed many yeares since, from vaine glories
inordinate follie: but the base necessities of an extraua∣gant melancholie
mate, that had no other vnde of quod ad victum attinet, but
the fore∣stalling of other mens inuentions, made my vnperfit Poems (in spite of
waste paper) to hazard an apprenteship in Poules: so that, that which in the
first peeping foorth was  wholie predestinate to your friendship,
by an vnderhand marte, is made the mercina∣rie recreation of euerie ridiculous
mate. Our wits now a daies are waxt verie fruite∣full, and our Pamphleters more
than prodi∣gall; So that the postes which stoode naked a tedious non
terminus, doo vaunt their dou∣ble apparrell as soone as euer the
Exche∣quer openeth; and euerie corner is tooke vp with some or other penilesse
companion that will imitate any estate for a two pennie almes. I could afford
you whole seruices of absurdities, that would disquiet the disgesti∣on of Arte
vs{que} ad nausaeam, were it not that I pittie to particularize
simple fellowes im∣perfections, and am altogether loath to ad∣uenture my paines
in so vngratefull a Pro∣uince. For transformed Scilla how euer she
hapned now to bee disioyned from disdain∣full Charybdis; thinke not,
but if they haue good shipping they wil meete ere long both in one shop: and
landed they had at this in∣stant, in one and the selfe same bay, if
Scilla (the vnfortunater of the two) had not met with a needie pirate
by the way. Ariued shee  is, though in a contrary coast, but so
wrackt, and weather beaten, through the vnskilful∣nes of rough writers, that
made their poast haste passage by night, as Glaucus would scarce know
her, if he met her: yet my hope is Gentlemen, that you wil not so much ima∣gine
what she is, as what shee was; insomuch as from the shop of the Painter, shee
is falne into the hands of the stainer. Thus referring the supportāce of my
credit, & the inability of my verse to your ingenious opinions, I bid you
farewel til the next Tearm; at vvhich time I hope to entertaine your seuerall
de∣lights, vvith farre better discourses, and bee suppliant to my good friend
Master Crane, in some or other more acceptable Poem. In the meane time
let my appliable voluisse, intitle me to your curtesie: vvhose I am
during Iife in all enterchangeable dutie.
