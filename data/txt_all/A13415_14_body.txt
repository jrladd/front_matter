YEt not to euery Reader doe I write,
But onely vnto such as can Read right:
And with vnpartiall censures can declare,
As they find things, to iudge them as they are.
For in this age, Criticks are such store,
That of a B. will make a Battledore,
Swallow downe Camells, and at Gnats will straine,
Make Mountaines of small Molehills, and againe
Extenuate faults, or else faults amplifie,
According as their carping censures flye.
Such are within the Motto of I haue,
But though the gallant Gulls be ne'r so braue,
And in their owne esteeme are deemed wise,
I haue a mind their follies to despise.
There are some few that wil their iudgement season
With mature vnderstanding, and with reason:
And call a spade a spade, a Sicophant,
A flatt'ring Knaue, and those are those I want.
For those that seeme to read, and scarce can spell,
Who neither point, nor keepe their periods well
Who doe a mans inuention so be-martyr,
So hanging, drawing, and so cut and quarter,
Making good lines contemptible threed-bare,
To keepe my booke from such as those I care.
