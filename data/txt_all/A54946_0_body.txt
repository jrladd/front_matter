Gentlemen,
THat I expose an accidental Ser∣mon to the world, who have al∣waies been so shie and wary; is only from the force of your command, delivered to me with that usual state (though complement too) which became men who at the time of preaching it had the Government of their house in their own hands. I owe much excuse to the world but cannot reasonably owe any to you, because your Judgment upon it ju∣stified the Discourse; and your Autho∣rity enjoyn'd me to deliver up the Copy. I was the more encouraged to do it, because I heard you had made a Loyal Address to the King; with

which, I hope the Sermon doth not in∣terfere. If you, or others may receive Advantage by the Perusal, I care not whether it please the Multitude or no; (for Physick is not acceptable to the Pa∣tient) but shall rest satisfied that I have observed your Commands: and that a Learned Body of Ingenious and Gentile Men are engag'd to defend it, whilst I remain,
Gentlemen,

Jan. 13. 1682.
