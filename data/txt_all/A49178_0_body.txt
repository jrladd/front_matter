AS the kind Sun (which cheers our dying Muse)
From the bright East, brings day, and with it, views
The World's fair Parts; but finding none so sweet
As th' Orient Beauties, whom he first did greet;
Back to his Morning Mistress he doth run;
Ending his round Heat there, where he begun.
So, though my Rhimes, like stragling Waters, fled
From Wit's clear Spring; from You, the Fountain's Head;
Yet now my Fancy pays its final Stream
To its first Helicon, and fairest Theam.


For sure, 'tis Heav'n's, with your blest Influence,
('Tis not th' Extream's usual Coincidence)
Which as it did at first our Verse Baptize;
So now redeems These from Idolatries.
That their late wand'ring Feet no more may roam;
But (like the elder Brothers) keep at home.
While You restore our Music, and renew
Our Mind, to sing again to God, and You.
See here our Muse washes her Feet, and all;
Turns Penitent, that had been Prodigal:
And as a Magdalen, with all her Store,
She worships Goodness; but doth wast no more.
She sends her Honey back, to that dear Hive,
Where she'll be bury'd, (if not kept alive.)


Then with her Notes, (Swan-like) she'll end her Days,
Singing Your Worth, her Requiem, and God's Praise.
