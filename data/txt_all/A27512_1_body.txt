Christian Reader,
OUt of a Respect to the Glory of the great God, who is a God that will he worshipped by true Worshippers in Spirit and in Truth, as also with a Desire of thy eter∣nal good; here is presented this following Treatise, which was formerly Penned by some Eminent Orthodox Divines, Late Non-Conformists, wherein are many solid Arguments, and Reasons, declaring, and clearly proving, the Book of Common-Prayer, or Litur∣gie, to be wholly taken out of the Masse-book; As first, The Common-Prayers are taken out of the Breviary; Secondly, The Administration of the Sacraments, Burial, Matrimo∣ny, Visitation of the Sick, are taken out of the Ritual, or Book of Rites; Thirdly, The Consecration of the Lords Supper, Collects, Epistles and Gospels, are out of the Masse-book: Fourthly, The Ordination of Archbishops, Bishops, and Ministers, is out of the Roman Pontifical: So that the Service-book being thus unmasked, is plainly evinced, to be a rank Impostor in Gods Worship; and, not∣withstanding its long Possession, it is even a violent intruder in the House of God.
Then a Word to you Readers, which are of Three sorts, either doubtful in suspense, vvho by this Treatise may be fully resolved; or such as use it, and Idolize it, by strength of
Reason may be brought off, and that such as cannot brook it, may be encouraged, not only (as a Learned Author ob∣serveth) because many of Gods People are of the same mind, but chiefly because God is of the same mind: Lastly, How much doth it concern all such, who have lifted up their hands to the Most High God, in a Solemn League and Covenant, for the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, Superstition, Heresie, Prophaness, and the Reformation of Religion, in Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline, according to the Word of God, and the best Reformed Churches, to contend earnestly for the Truth, and for purity in Gods Worship? This being the prime work of the day, and of this Book, to inform thee of the Truth, and (as the Scripture saith) if the Truth make us free, we shall be free indeed.
