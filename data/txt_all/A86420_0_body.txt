THe grace of our Lord be multi∣plied upon you all, and streng∣then you in every good word and work. Beloved in the Lord, you may remember that one William Pe∣delsden, who professes and preaches the universal point at Sheels, did pre∣sent to me and some others in the face of the Church certain dangerous Queries, requiring our Answer, and for truths sake, there being other busi∣ness lying upon Brother Gover, you desired me to write and publish an Answer to them; and though I am sensible that in my appearing publick∣ly, I am called rather to manifest the present dealings of God with me,
and my former unkinde dealings with him; but being sensible how much this opinion spreads, and what dan∣gerous consequences are produced by it, I could not but after a serious seek∣ing of God endeavour to answer your desires herein, and the rather, knowing that it is one of the general ways wherein the Devil deludes poor souls, for I have found by experience, that these two ways are the general Heads the Devil commonly goes upon, and gradually proceeds in, to draw away souls from the good way of the Lord; first perswading men under specious pretences, to allegorize Scaiptures, and turn all into a more spiritual un∣derstanding and enjoyment than at present they have attained to, who stand by the Rule of Truth in the pra∣ctice of Gospel order and ordinances, and this is backed on as I told you be∣fore with specious pretences of spiri∣tuality, though in truth it is that which ends in carnality, though at the
first it doth not so appear, which I can sadly witness; the Devil commonly imploys this way, with such spirits that are taken with curiosity of words and notions, leaving the wholesom Word of the Lord. The second ge∣neral way the Deluder takes, is by dis∣covering the way of God and the Do∣ctrine of the Gospel under a greater way of rationality, though it be but that which doth answer that reason which indeed is carnal, which the Apostle speaks of in 1 Cor. 2, & 3. ch. at large; this second way the Devil takes many who are not capable of the first; but both are very danger∣ous; and though the first was my proper snare, yet I judg it not amiss to let some part of my imployment be also to discover the second, which ac∣cording to my weak ability in this writing I have endeavoured, desiring the Lord it may accomplish that end which you and I desire, to wit, the putting a stop to that opinion which
the Author of those Queries doth hold forth, which in many places doth so sadly spread, and for the establish∣ing of the weak that are ready to stag∣ger; so desiring the Lord in his power and presence to own it; I shall say no more as to the matter, nor end, but commend you to God and the Word of his grace; I remain,

From Sagerstonehugh the 9th day of the 12th Moneth, 1654.
