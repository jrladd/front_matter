BOund by your Bounty and mine owne desire,
To tender still new tribute of my zeale
To you (your Countries watchfull Sentinel,
Whose Wisedome, ours and other States admire)
Lo, heer I tune vponmine humble Lyre
Our neighbour Kingdomes vn-expected weale,
Through suddain ceasing of Warres enter-deale;
As Celtike Muses to my Muse inspire.
Miraculous the Work; and so his wit
That firstly sung this sacred MIRACLE:
A gracious Theame (If I dis-grace not it)
That your graue eyes my daigne for spectacle.
What e'r it be, accept it as a due
From him whose all doth all belong to You.
