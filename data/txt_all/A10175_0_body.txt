MY Lorde, hauyng from my youthe in memore the precepte of Apelles, moste excellent Painter of his tyme, who commaunded his Prentices not to passe one daie, without drawyng of a line, to the ende to keepe theim in breath and continuance (as doeth the Hunter his Greyhounde) he see∣meth by that precepte to shewe howe greately idlenesse is to bee auoided, and howe greate is the losse of tyme, to leaue the exercise of trauaile. And therefore, not to transgresse this precepte in these tumuliuous and turbulente ty∣mes, coposed of more then ciuile warres in the bowells of France, I haue addressed my self for the auoidyng of Idlenesse, to drawe my line vpon an humble and lowe subiect, to make a discourse of domesticall Housbandry. & to shewe how a diligent man maie of one little summe, drawe greate games by honeste menes. Which doyng, I greately recreate my Spirites emong my bookes, and for∣get a greate parte of my soron full thoughtes of these troublous tymes. And forasmuche as I knowe, that after long practise of armes, and the greate trauaile which you haue had therein, the trauaile of letters shalbe greatly delectable vnto to you, when with equall pase, you ioyne wisedome with magnanimitie, I haue taken vppon me the boldnesse, to present vnto you this my little labour,
by the readyng whereof you maie take one hower of recreation. I haue addressed this little Housbandrie in suche order, that the practise beyng therein well instructed in buiyng, and conseruatiō of thynges bought, with discreete distribution of the same, maie assure hym self to lacke no marchantes. This little discourse, is of the time of the troubles of the yere M.D.LXVII. before that the Winde Caecias drewe the cloude of trou∣bles into the countries of Poictu and Lo∣dunoys, where I appoincted the Marchaunte to make his emploit, as shall bee sene in the readyng.
