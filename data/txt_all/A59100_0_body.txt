To the Right Honourable and truly Noble Lord, Robert Earl of Salisbury, Viscount Cranborn, Baron Cecil of Essenden, Knight of the Illustrious Order of the Garter, Lord High Treasurer of England, Master of the Court of Wards, and Privy Counsellor to His Most Excellent Majesty, JAMES, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Heartily according to his high desert, I devote and dedicate,
AND as it were with consecrated Flowr, and crackling grain of Salt, I offer up in Sacrifice. I am not in condition to do it with a costly Victim, or a full Censer. GREAT SIR, deign with favour to receive these scraps of Collection; relating intirely, what they are, and as far as the present Age may be supposed to be concerned in ancient Sto∣ries and Customes, to the English-British State and Government; and so far forth to Your most Honoured Name. Which Name of Yours, whilest I, one of the lowermost Bench, do with dazzled eye-sight look up∣on (most Noble Lord, and great Support of your Country) I devoutly lay down Upon its ALTAR This small Earnest and Pledge of my Obedience and Duty.
