MAdame: The
Apostle vn∣to
the He∣brewes
tea∣cheth
vs,
that within the Ark of the
couenant there was a cruse
full of Manna and Aarons
rod.Heb. 9. 4. God thereby instru∣cting
vs, that he hath not
onely a care of the nou∣rishing
of our soules, but

to correct vs for our sins
also: and that he hath gi∣uen
vs together with the
bread of his word, his rod
of afflictiōs. The one nou∣risheth
vs, the other exer∣ciseth
vs: the one instru∣cteth
vs, the other refor∣meth
vs: the one teacheth
vs to do the will of God,
the other maketh vs to re∣nounce
our owne: both
equally effects of his loue.
For God humbleth vs by
afflictions, and pricketh
the swelling of our pride.
He cutteth & loppeth vs,
to the end we may bring
forth the more fruite. He
filleth vs with bitternesse
in this life, to the end we
might long for the life to
come. For those whom

God afflicteth grieuously
in this world, leaue it with
lesse griefe. And indeed if
the childrē of Israel, being
come out of Egypt, after
hauing endured there so
many afflictions, did not∣withstanding
grieue, and
oftentimes mutined to re∣turne
thither againe: how
much more had they grie∣ued
if they had suffered
nothing? Adde hereunto,
that God who hath for∣med
vs to feare him, kno∣weth
that our prayers are
slacke and cold in prospe∣ritie,
as proceeding from a
spirit that is cooled by
successe, and which are en∣dited
by custom. The cries
which our owne will pro∣duceth
are feeble, in com∣parison

of those which
griefe expresseth. There is
nothing so strong as ne∣cessitie:
nothing so ingeni∣ous
to pray well as sorow,
which in an instant for∣meth
the slowest tongues
to a holy eloquence, and
furnisheth vs with sighes
which cannot be expres∣sed.
It is not then in anger
that God afflicteth vs; but
because that sinne is a kind
of falling sicknesse, God
striketh and afflicteth vs
to awaken vs. His beatings
are fatherly corrections: if
he vsed vs otherwise, we
should not be his childrē.
For if a man seeing two
children a fighting, doe
chastise one for the same,
without touching the o∣ther;

the standers by, with∣out
further knowing him,
presume that it is his fa∣ther:
so God correcteth as
his children those which
he embraceth with a fa∣therly
loue.1. Pet. 4. 17. He beginneth
his chastisings at his owne
house. Now if Iesus Christ
(as saith the Apostle) hath
learned obediēce by the things
which he hath suffered,Heb. 5. 8. al∣though
he were the Son: how
much more ought wee to
bow downe our neckes
vnto Gods corrections, &
humble our selues in his
presence, rather then to
kicke against the prick, or
to make the afflictions
which are bitter enough
of themselues, to be yet
more bitter by impatiēce?

None can make a white
haire become blacke with
all his care: but well may
he make his blacke haire
becom white through his
vnprofitable discontent. It
is euer better to follow,
then to be dragged on, a∣boue
all when God con∣ducteth
vs: for if the way
through which he leadeth
vs be thornie, yet is it
straight.
Now when I cast mine
eye vpon all the remedies
of afflictions, I find there
are three things which
may asswage griefe; time,
reason, and the feare of
God. For length of time
mitigateth sorow, and clo∣seth
vp the wound, yea e∣uen
in the weakest spirits,

and most vncapable of
consolation: but reason e∣steemeth
this remedie too
long, and vnworthy of a
couragious man; for wea∣rinesse
of weeping is a
poore remedie. The feare
of God doth more: for as
to appease griefe, reason
stayeth not for time, so the
feare of God stayeth not
for reason; but before that
reason can bring in her
consolations drawne from
the ineuitable necessitie of
euils, or from the vnprofi∣tablenesse
of teares, that
resolueth promptly vpon
the loue of God, who cha∣stiseth
vs for our good: so
as in steed of casting forth
complaints, it findeth out
occasion of thanksgiuing,

and formeth not only vn∣to
patience, but also vnto
ioy, as acknowledging a∣mongst
his afflictions cer∣taine
signes of Gods loue.
These documents Ma∣dame,
are so much the
more familiar vnto you, as
you haue had often expe∣rience
of them, and who
being past her apprētiship
in afflictions, haue careful∣ly
sought out the lenitiues
which Gods word doth
furnish vs withall: which,
besides that sobrietie and
modestie which shineth in
you, and hath altogether
estranged you from the
vanitie which now a daies
reigneth in the world,
haue taught you to solace
your selfe with God. But

take heed also lest you suf∣fer
your selfe to be ouer∣whelmed
with sorow, and
make pietie the nurse of
discontēt. Inueterat griefs
do often turne into habit,
and old wounds become
fresh with too much hand∣ling;
which me thinks is a∣boue
all verie vnfitting
your nature, whose meek∣nes
and gentlenes so plea∣sing
vnto all, is much more
at accord with ioy. Shall it
be said, that the great vi∣uacity
of spirit which God
hath giuē you, serueth you
but to feele griefe more
sensibly? or that God hath
made you great, that your
teares might haue the
greater fall? Time which
easeth the most ignorant

people of their euils, can∣not
it finish the sighes of
a person whom God hath
so much enriched with his
knowledge? Shall it not
be better to ioy in future
good things, which are
great and certaine, then to
afflict our selues for euils
past, which are remediles?
Herein surely God is of∣fended,
if in worldly cros∣ses
we find more occasion
of griefe, then matter of
ioy in heauēly riches. And
wrongfully do we com∣plaine
of our afflictions;
seeing we hurt our selues,
we doe vnderhand as it
were confesse, that God
hath not afflicted vs e∣nough.
The Psalmist saith
indeed, that God putteth vp

our teares into his bottels, as
precious things: but he
speaketh of teares bred of
repentance, or of griefe, to
see God blasphemed and
despised amongst men. For
God gathereth not vp ob∣stinate
tears, which exten∣ding
themselues beyond
their limits, occupie the
time due to consolation.
How many times (giuing
your selfe to reading) haue
you bedewed the holie
scripture with your teares,
and yet this booke contai∣neth
the matter of our
ioy? And in the booke of
Psalmes, the tunes wherof
you loue, and yet much
more the matter, where
you see your own picture,
and the anatomie of your

inward affections: Haue
you not obserued that all
the Psalmes which haue
their beginnings troubled,
and whose first lines con∣taine
nothing but profoūd
sighes and broken com∣plaints,
do end in delight,
and termes which witnes
contentment and peace of
conscience? Let your tears
Madame, be formed vpon
this example, and let them
end in spirituall ioy. Let
your faith raise her selfe
from vnder her burthen,
and let the sluces of affli∣ctions,
which God hath
stopped her course withal,
make her to runne forth
with the greater impetu∣ousnes:
let her take strēgth
from resistance. Hereunto

the meditation of Gods
graces will much serue
you: the which if you coū∣terballance
with your e∣uils,
they will mightily
weigh them downe. The
onely attention of future
glorie, which you appre∣hend
by faith, can it not
digest all bitternesse? That
faith which filled the Mar∣tyrs
with ioy in the midst
of their present torments,
may she not in our rest
comfort vs against the me∣morie
of passed euils. And
you who acknowledge
what seruitude those peo∣ple
liue in, which are drag∣ged
into perdition by the
inuisible chaines of opiniō
and custome: can you suffi∣ciently
magnifie the grace

which God hath giuen
you, in honoring you with
his alliance; and enlight∣ning
you with his truth?
Yea, and in your life time,
how many of Gods assi∣stances,
how many diffi∣culties
happily ouergone?
God hauing giuē you the
grace to be alone in your
family an example of con∣stancie
and holy perseue∣rance
in the profession of
his truth, hauing made you
great, that in the contra∣diction
of the world, you
might be an example of
firmenesse and constan∣cie.
And yet admit your
wounds were more grie∣uous,
as taking all at the
worst, our liues being so
short, they cānot long last:

for you are not troubled
to seeke consolations a∣gainst
death, seeing that
death it selfe is a consola∣tion
vnto vs. For God if
he receiue the sighs which
wee powre foorth in our
praiers, much more regar∣deth
he the sighes which
our soules giue vp vnto
him in our deaths. Which
being a place of shelter,
and which putteth our
soules into securitie, we
ought not onely looke for
his coming, but euen go
forth to meete him: haste∣ning
his comming by our
desires, by the example of
S. Paul,Phil. 1. 23. who saith, that his
desire tendeth to dislodge,
and be with Christ. And to
say with Dauid:Psal. 42. 2. O when

shall I present my selfe before
Gods face? For our soules
being bound vnto our bo∣dies
by two bonds, wher∣of
the one is naturall, and
the other voluntarie: if
through hatred and con∣tempt
of life present, we
vntie the voluntary bond,
waiting the time when
God shall breake the na∣turall,
death then coming
shall find the businesse be∣gun,
and our soules prepa∣red
to this dissolution.
These cogitations Ma∣dame,
and such like, haue
hitherto giuen you conso∣lation:
the which although
you be sufficiently proui∣ded
of, and haue alwayes
readie, many spirituall re∣medies,
yet you borrow

from other the receipts;
and haue thought that I
could contribute some∣thing
to your consolation.
And to this effect hauing
heard talke of some of my
Sermons vpon the Loue
of God, you would needs
make vse of the power
you haue ouer me, deman∣ding
them of me in wri∣ting;
knowing well, that
of the discontentments of
this life, there is no such
gentle remouall as the
loue of God, or more
stronger remedy then that
he loueth vs. Herefrom I
drew backe a long time,
partly through idlenesse
accompanied with some
other distractions: partly
through feare, apprehen∣ding

your iudgement,
which far surpassing ordi∣narie
spirits, feedeth it self
not vpon vulgar meates.
At length, after long de∣lay,
being not any longer
able to striue against your
instant requests, which are
vnto me as so many com∣mandements,
I haue let
this discourse come forth
in publick, vnder the pro∣tection
of your name, to
the end that the imperfe∣ctions
thereof may like∣wise
be imputed vnto
you, and that you might
beare also a part of the
blame, for hauing assisted
at the birth of that which
ought not to haue seene
the light: but I shall be ea∣sily
excused, as hauing o∣beyed

you. For honor shal
it euer be vnto me, to exe∣cute
your cōmandements,
and to employ my selfe
to do you most humble
seruice, as being your
