My Lord,
YOUR Generosity to Strangers, which all the World owns and must admire, hath Encourag'd me to Publish these Papers under the Protection of your Venerable Name. They are of such a Na∣ture, as may in a great measure expect a favourable Reception from your Lordship, who are one of the Fathers of our Church; And may not be ungrate∣ful to those, who would know what Luminaries shone, and what Learn'd Men Flourish'd even in those dark and ignorant days of Christianity.
My Lord,
I will not trouble your Lordship with a long Account of Du-Pin's Performance, whom you very well understand in the Original; and much more the Fathers of whose Writings and Lives he has given us an Ex∣tract in this Collection. Whether I have done him Justice or no, your Lordship is the best Judge. Such therefore as it is, I submit it and my self to better Judgments, and Humbly Present it to your Lordship, as an Acknowledgment of the Honour I have of being one of,
My Lord,
