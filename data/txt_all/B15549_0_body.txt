Most pious Lady:
THat's all the Title I shall bee bold with at this time; your Religion in my eyes being a more
 glorious attribute than your Court∣ly Honours: I am glad your Re∣quest (though I wish it bad beene a Command) hath prevented my slacknesse, and turn'd my Pre∣sent into a Debt, and my Gift into
 a Duty: GOD knows with what joy I read your faire Letter, when I perceiv'd Your holy desire to bee instructed by Writing con∣cerning the dayly Tryall of Consci∣ence, which be∣fore wee past over
 in a short Dis∣course, which is but conceite and thought made au∣dible by Words; whereas the du∣ring Character is both thought and word made vi∣sible and perma∣nent. I would to God (so much I
 tender my Soules good) that I were alwaies thus im∣ployed, upon con∣dition I could bee alwaies thus hap∣pily prevented in the unforc'd de∣sires of a Devoute Soule. So little cause your honour had to complement
 a feare of trouble in my task, which is above merit re∣warded in the ve∣ry imployment, e∣specially since your Goodnesse hath condescended to request, where your Greatnesse might command. Hee that in this
 would not serve you, would forfeit the Title of Ser∣vant to his God; who put it into your soule, to put Your Conscience into a Quotidi∣an Triall: a great mysterie in Di∣vinity, every heart does not
 conceive it, every eye cannot see it; or both these be∣ing yeelded, every hand cannot skill to put that in acti∣on, which the heart has in spe∣culation. Concer∣ning which in∣comparable helpe to all Devotion,
 I could relate un∣to you what admi∣rable and Divine Elogies it has beene Crowned within the circle of all Ages, ever since the Patri∣arch walk't out in∣to the Fields to meditate, even to this colder time
 of, at the best luke∣warme Religion; by what, and how many glorious Lu∣minaries of the Church, nay, the very Sophies and Philosophers it hath been set upon a hill conspicuous to all the World, had the World not
 lost her old Eye-sight: But the rare Opinion your Honour professes to have enter∣tain'd of it at my first Discourse, saves all this La∣bour, and I shall hereafter ranke your admiration of it amongst the
 choysest Argu∣ments, both of its use & glory: both being exceeding ample; the use be∣cause of its neces∣sity to Man; the glory by reason of our familiaritie with God: A∣braham beeing from hence espe∣cially
 stil'd Gods Friend. We see, that speaking af∣ter the manner of men, time has de∣riv'd unto us a Proverbe, viz. that even recko∣nings make long Friends. GOD has caught the World, or would
 doe in her owne Dialect: For this EXAMINATION being derived from a Latin word that signifies the Tongue of the Scales, is nothing else but a just and even Triall of the Conscience (by that weight which
 Law exacts, and that Allowance which Gospel per∣mits) every Day in the Sight of GOD, that all Accounts of the Soule may be even before the Image of Death, that is, Sleepe sieze on us in a figure:
 So that let GOD please, to call when hee plea∣ses, no Minuite shall finde us in security, all our Accompts are made, and writ in the blood of a Mediator, all is even, be∣cause hee has
 paide all, and thus GOD and wee are Friends for all our ine∣quality: Thus with Enoch wee walke with GOD here, till it please him to translate us to a better place. This is the Tryall in gene∣rall,
 and a hap∣py Soule it is wheresoever this gracious Guest shall make abode: Wherfore to make some little, but constant prepara∣tion, Ile onely doe as much for the Stranger, as the Shunanite did
 for the waifaring Prophet, provide a Table, a Stoole, and a Candlestick, the one for his re∣past, the other for his repose, the last for his late and early Secti∣ons and Devoti∣ons, that is, by way of Introdu∣ction
 set downe three generall Re∣quisites necessary to bee observed of all those who in∣tend to reape a blessing by this ex∣ercise.
