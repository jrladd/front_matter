wherewith Your Father (the best of Kings) was well∣comed at his re∣turn from Scot∣land, I dedicate to Your Highnesse: not unadvisedly, that when you shal bee indued with e∣rudition (the orna∣ment

long since of your ancestors) you may draw from this smal me∣morial, whatsoe∣ver it bee, a more glorious treasure then a triple Crown; namely, an hereditary image of vertue.
