MY good Lord, I looked for better motions to write off, but mooued with worse causes than either I thought to treate on or see, fol∣lowes matter presently ministred, of heaui∣nes, sorrow, & mourning fit for my aged yeers to thinke on, but vnapt for your honorable eares to heare of: notwithstāding the strange euents that time produceth (and all ages do offer) with the woonderfull workes of the Lord, my muse and pen is compelled to write that I wish not, and follow the course of hard destinies that often comes without welcome, and are to be obeyed because they bring no remedie with them. The liues of good men are gladsome to heare of, but the death of euery one in generall, is heauy to behold: first for the losse of friends, (for the affection we beare them,) & for the want of those we can not call againe (whatsoeuer neede requireth their presence) nor beare eeuenly the losse of such as we are bounde to fauor when death takes them hence, and life denies them any longer continuance on earth: my good Lord your noble father who fauored me much, and my Lord Chamberlaine that loued me not a little, (whose troth and woorthines I am too meane to write of) sturs vp my spirits (that in a maner drowpeth to honor the names of those that were woorthies in our age, and shew in verse that men

of value and laudation should be alwaies honored in the best sort we can deuise. Thus waying the sudden departures of diuers woorthie men (in their calling and vocation) some famous and learned Bishops, some renowmed Captaines and couragious Leaders, and some most honorable Personages, Gouernours of our state, taken all away together in one yeere. I not onely la∣ment soe great a losse, but in the number rehersed haue founde out one among the cheife an honorable Knight, I knew for many parts well abled in goodnes to be written of to the vttermost of my inuentions and skill, thinking my selfe fortunate to set foorth the vnstained life of so happie a Councellor: but my great loue to him, presumsion and forwardnes to enrowle his name among a multitude, makes me passe the bonds of ordinary duty, and free∣ly vtter the opinion conceiued of his vertues, which neither pen can amplely pronounce, nor writer may easily set out: God grant the curious wits of the world stand as well pleased with my pains, as your L. I dout not is glad to heare your worthy father in law praised, then I account my labor well bestowed, and so take leaue, wishing your Lordship long life and blessednes, with double increase of vertue and honor.
