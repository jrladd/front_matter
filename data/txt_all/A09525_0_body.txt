I Haue aduentured (curteous, vertuous,
and wise) with the strong wrastlers of
Olympia, though not to winne, yet to
worke for the Garland, I meane the
Laurell wreath of your gentle fauours.
The iudgement of my labours relyeth
on your seuerall censures, whereof if your opinions rel∣lish
but one small taste of content, I presume vpon a
generall liking of others; such is the sufficiencie I con∣ceaue
of your discrete iudgements. Therefore touch
and taste, taste and disgest but with such contentment
that you may applaud the fruitfull operation. How it
will prooue I know not, but I hope pleasant in disges∣ture:
For howeuer the fruits of my toyle now rellish
after the long gathering, I dare protest the tree from
whence they were pluckt, came of a Royall stocke;
make therefore your seuerall choyces of the best, and
if you finde some more greene then others, impute it
to their want of growth in that they are but yong,

and not come to their true perfection, or rather blame
my rashnes, that make sale of them for mellow fruite,
when indeede they are not ripe. But in hope they will
all proue delicious according to your expectations, I
present them in all loue to your kinde acceptances, pro∣mising
as much in affection as any other can performe
in perfection. Therefore looke and like of such as you
finde, and I promise you (vnder your fauourable incou∣ragements)
to imploy all my best designes and studies
to your seuerall good likings.
