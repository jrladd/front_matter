MADAM,
MY apprehensive quil drew∣in its bashfull Inke, at the presumption to fron∣tispiece so mean a pre∣sent, as a Translation, with an Inscription to a Person of so much Honour, so much worth, so thronged an Inventory, and so compleat a Synopsis, of all Perfections. But embold∣ned, first, by the Precedent of the French Translator; secondly, encouraged by the
 Piety of the Subject; moved thirdly, by the Noblenesse of the Author: It hath distil∣led some obliged drops towards this Dedi∣cation to your Ladyship of a French treatise, done into the English dialect, to an unparallel'd Mistriss in both, of a Pious subject to a pious Patronesse, of a No∣ble Author to a Noble Lady. Madam, you shall here behold a Royal Convert: The Angells rejoyce at the Conversion of a sinner; and, as your vertues intitle you to their Fellowship, and something above mortall in your beauty to their resemblance, you must necessarily partake of their Joy, and fill up the quire of that Coelestiall Hi∣erarchy with your Allelujah's. And seeing nothing but a little Clay (which although in reference to your Ladyship's amiable Symmetry, is stamped with a preparative Angelicall Impresse) detaineth you from the present enjoyment of their blessed So∣ciety; you cannot neverthelesse but be alike moved with them, and will (I hope) afford the Gracious Influence of your Protecting beames to the unworthy Interpreter of these welcome Tydings, and crown him
 (which is the highest ayme his ambition levells at) with a Crown, studded and enammell'd with your smiles. As this Consideration seemed to extenuate my boldnesse; So, the Universall engaging sweet∣nesse of your disposition, the obliging Pro∣digallity of your favours to me in parti∣cular, and the deep sense of gratitude to your noble family and relations, VVarran∣ted the Inscription, and Commands the Subscription of
Madam,
