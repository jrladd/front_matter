Right Honourable Lord,
IF the life of man were
onely intended but to
eate, drinke, comple∣ment,
and sleepe; it
might agree with that Epitaph of
Heliogabalus, Ede, bibe, lude, post mor∣tem
nulla voluptas, and so become
meere Animall. But since th'Al∣mighty
and high disposer of this
his Clocke-like frame of the Ma∣crocosme,
whereto his blessed will
is the waight and Cause of Motion,
hath given to humanes, Reason, as
the key to wind up the small por∣tative watch of our owne Micro∣cosme,
whereby wee are apt still to
turne the wheeles of our Cogitati∣ons
upon th'objects present them∣selves;

bee you pleased then (No∣ble
Lord) that what I so heere have
done, I present to your Honour,
beseeching your pardon therein if
too bold; for, if you question why
to you? I beeing a stranger, I hum∣bly
answere, though a stranger to
your Honourable Person, yet not to
the Fame of the worthy, love you
beare to good Arts and Artists;
which I know by many friends to
your vertuous and Noble inclina∣tion.
If therefore you please to
deigne the vacancie of your more
serious affayres, to the view of these
my short enterviewes, I referre
them to your censure; and recreati∣on,
resting
