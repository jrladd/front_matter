GREAT SIR,
IT would be hard to find out Reasons which might justi∣fie the boldness of this De∣dication; did not the Subject of the Book direct it to Your High∣nesses feet. Whither can Religi∣on and Truth fly for refuge from foul Superstition back'd with hel∣lish Fury, but to the Protection of that fortunate Arm to which
already so many Nations owe the enjoyment of their Religion, their Liberty, and whatsoever is dear to Men and Christians.
By Your Heroick Courage, and more than human Conduct it is, that Our Selves are not the Subject of a like lamentable Hi∣story, and that we read the sal∣vage Barbarities of these Bigots in a Translation. Few Years, it was hop'd, would have pass'd, before our own Country might have been the Scene of their Vil∣lanies; and what we now upon reading can hardly believe, we should then have seen and felt. But the God of Heaven of his in∣finite Mercy check'd their Pro∣gress, forbad the proud Waves,
and set bounds to their Inso∣lence.
Accept therefore, Mighty PRINCE, this humble Dedica∣tion of the best and fittest Offer∣ing can be made to Your Illu∣strious Name by us the Fellow-Sharers in that great Deliverance which Providence, by your High∣nesses means, has wrought for us.
