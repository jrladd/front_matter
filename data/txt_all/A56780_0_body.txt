SIR,
WHen I had finished this discourse
of The Worth of a Penie,
or, A Caution to keep Mo∣ney,
and bethinking my selfe
unto whom I should offer the
Dedication, none came more
opportunely into my thought then your self: for I
imagined, if I should dedicate the same unto any
penurious or miserable minded man, it would make
him worse, and be more uncharitable and illiberall;
if unto a bountifull and free-minded Patrone, I
should teach him to hold his hand, and against his

nature make him a miser. I to avoid either, made
choise of your selfe, who being yet unmarried, walk
alone by your selfe, having neither occasion of the
one nor the other: Beside, you have travelled
France and Italie, and I hope have learned thrift
in those places, and understand what a vertue
Parsimonie is; for want whereof, how many young
heires in England have gallop'd through
their estates before they have been thirty? Lastly,
my obligation is so much to your learned and good
father, and for goodnesse your incomparable mo∣ther,
that I should ever have thought the worse of
my selfe, if I had not Cum tota mea supellex
sit chartacea, as Erasmus saith: I had not ex∣pressed
my duty and hearty love unto you one way
or other,
