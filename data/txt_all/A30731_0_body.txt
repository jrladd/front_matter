MY LORD,
IN Obedience to your Commands, I have published this Sermon preached before you on our late General and Publick Fast day. I endeavoured to speak those things which were most suitable to the oc∣casion of that our Solemn Assembly, and proper to excite only those Affections which became a People, humbling themselves be∣fore God, and supplicating for Pardon and Mercy and Assistance. And if the Print∣ing of this plain Discourse, may in any measure help to forward that Reformation of our Lives, it was designed to convince
 the hearers of the necessity and advantages of, I shall bless God for this opportunity, of doing something, how little soever it be, towards the promoting the Publick Good; Which that we may all, in our several places, zealously endeavour to advance, is the hearty Prayer of
My Lord,
