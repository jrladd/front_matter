SIR,
IF these my small En∣deavours
may find ac∣ceptance,
I have the end
of my desires; I confess they are

the fruits of some spare hours,
designed only for the benefit of
recreation; therefore I hope you
will read them for diversions, not
Precepts; only let me advise
you, to meditate upon the unwor∣thiness
of Dimagoras with de∣testation;
upon the puissance of
Amoronzo wth admiration;
upon the hospitality of Kalander
with imitation; upon the Vir∣tues
of Celania with affectati∣on:
Thus if you can gather
any delight from it, I am very

well satisfied, desiring you to par∣don
what you find amiss, and no
to dis-respect it in being mine▪
So you shall ingage me to be
SIR,
Yours to esteem yo
