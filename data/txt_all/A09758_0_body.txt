REligion,Gloriosa in deum pietas honoribus re∣giis immobile est fundamen∣tum. Cyrillus ad Theodos. de recta fide. dread and deare Soueraigne, is an vnmoueable foū∣dation of highest au∣thoritie and honour. O then howe blessed are all we? how sure and vnmooueable is our peace and ioy? God hauing blessed vs with a king, who in religion and learning excelleth all aliue, and his Maiestie with a Queene in due proportion answerable to himselfe. Wherefore as it is our dutie to ioyne both in our daily praiers: so neither would I separate you in my humble endeauours. For the present felicitie and glory of this realme resteth wholly in his Maiestie,

but the future hope to haue these infinite blessings continued vpon vs and all our posteritie, euen vnto the worlds end, ari∣seth from you both, in respect of that most happie royall issue you haue had al∣readie, and which if it please God you may haue hereafter. Which as it will be our greatest securitie and comfort: so that it may be no danger to your Maiesties health, especially that which your High∣nesse now goeth withall, we shall continu∣ally and importunately pray and beseech at Gods hands. And what the power of praier is, this short sermō which I pre∣sume to offer vnto your sacred Maiestie, doeth in some sort shewe.
