SYr, I perceiue you are an earnest In∣tercessour & suter, that I would suf∣fer a Declamation I made some fewe yeares ago against Women, to come abroade in Print: and to perswade me vnto the same, you al∣ledge two reasons. The one is, because it being (as you say) a most rare and curious peece of worke, it is sought for and desired



of many. The other, for that you doubt lest the world seeing the Answere of my deare Cosin Signior Torquato Tasso, vnto the same, falsly presupposing that I blame Marriage, it might one day (as you doubt) hauing no witnesse to cōtrary it, bring some blemish or staine vnto the clearnesse and purenesse of my pietie and religion: And therefore I, who for your first reason wold haue most plainly & absolutely haue denied your re∣quest, knowing verie well the lightnesse and the vnperfectnesse of this Discourse, In consideratiō of your second, cannot chuse but yeeld vnto your friendly desire: so as I, resigning all the interest and right I haue of the same vnto you, do giue you full power & authoritie to do with this toy what you please: for, for mine owne part, I assure you I knew not vpon whom to bestow it, for the vnworthinesse thereof. Only this I will intreate you, that when you shall send it a∣broad to be common, you will vouch safe me so much fauor, as to satisfie the curious Reader, that it was done vpon no other oc∣casion, then of a certaine youthfull Ca∣prichious



Humour, protesting vnto you, that I my selfe longere this, had contradic∣ted the same, had not my foresaid famous kinsman preuented me in mine own mea∣ning, whose conclusion and censure, as I ratifie and confirme for most infallible and true: so, who shall reade mine owne, shall easely perceiue that it doth not much disagree from his opinions, if hee well marke and haue but an eye vnto the begin∣ning and ende of the matter from whence the maner of Writers is to drawe and bor∣row their purpose & inuentions. And thus crauing euerie Noble and generous minde, to make the best construction of the same, Vibascio le Mani, and bid you farewell. From my House in Bergamo, this first of May, 1598.
