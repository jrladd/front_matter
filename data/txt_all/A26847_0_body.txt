Madam,
AS nothing is more usu∣al,
then for those, who
write Books, to De∣dicate
them to some
Person or other: So
it's as usual with those
that do it, to make known to the
World, the Reason of such their De∣dication;
and, Why to such a Person.

Among other reasons, none are more
frequently alleadged, then Eminent
Favours received. Madam, If I would
make these the Reasons of my De∣dicating
this Book to you, it were
sufficient to satisfy any, Why I have
pitched upon you, rather then upon
another. I could tell the World,
What a grear Debtor you have me to
you, especially in this day, wherein
the Hand of the Lord hath been, and
still is, very heavy upon me: You
have been a Nurse, and very much of
a Physitian to me; You have ministred
to my Necessities; You have often
cheared me with your Visits; Yea,
you left not, till you had found out,
an Able and Eminent Physitian, and
brought him to me, under whose hands
I at present am, waiting upon God
for the Issue. Certainly, these are
Favours that are not to be forgotten;
and might very well be alleadged, as

the Reason of my Dedicating this
inconsiderable Peece to you. But,
Madam, under favour, I must tell you
and the world, that this Dedication,
neither respecteth, nor relates to, any
of these. The only Reason, is, truly
this, That there is none, can claim
such an Interest in the Book, as your
self; and if it be worth seeing the
Light, you must be thanked for it.
You were the Person, who, for some
years last past, did with much impor∣tunity,
solicit me to the Printing and
Publishing of these Sermons; You
rested not, till you had obtained a
promise from me, of doing it; When
my Copy was finished, you were im∣patient
till it were sent to the Press;
and when it was in the Press, in all
your inquiries after it, you were pleas∣ed
to Stile it by the Name of Your
Book. So many wayes have you been
pleased to make it your own, that I

should have wronged you very much,
if I should have denied you, the right
you have to it. And now Madam,
having given you this accompt of the
Reason of my Dedicating this Book
to you, I shall next give you, a brief
accompt of the Book it self. It Treats
of a Subject, which few or none (that
I know of) have written of, (I mean)
so as to make it the sole Subject, of
a full and just Discourse. It is a Sub∣ject,
that Universally respecteth all,
of what Degree or Quality soever,
High and Low, Rich and Poor; yea,
the Highest, and the Lowest; The
King that Sits upon the Throne, and
the Beggar that fits upon the Dung∣hill.
GOD, the Great Founder,
and Framer of Conditions, hath not
made all men, equal and alike in re∣spect
of Stature, (Saul, was taller than
the people, by the head and shoulders)
no more hath he made all equall, in
