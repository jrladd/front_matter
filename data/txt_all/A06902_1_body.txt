SIR,
ALL Rivers and Ri∣vellets,
Fountaines
and Waters what soe∣ver,
come from the
Sea, and returne
to the Sea, the
▪ to acknowledge the Hap∣esse
of their Beginnings; the other,

to restore the Rent & Tribute of their
Duties. So all subiects receiue happi∣nesse
from their Souer aignes, and to
them they ought to restore any thing
that they can call happy within them;
Hence, I have presumed in all Humili∣ty
and obedience, to present to his Sa∣cred
Maiestie, this little Treatise of
The Art of Archerie▪ and how
it may profitably be vsed in this King∣dome,
to the Aduancement of the
Trayned Bands (to whose Glorie and
Good, your place especially calles you
to the Propagation and increase o
young Souldiers, and to the suppon
and Re-edifing, of the now falling
and almost vtterly ruin'd Societies 
Bowyers and Fletchers: who 
I am credibly informed, and part
know by diuers true observations) 
so shaken and decayed in their Estat
and Tradings, that without his M∣iestie
Assist, it is impossible for the

to subsist. Then (worthy Sir) be
pleased to lay your vertuous Hand to
this Building, and make your selfe
Master of many Hearts, and many
Prayers, which (vnder your Pardon)
you may thus effect, by procuring to
be inserted into the Letters for Mu∣sters;
that the Supplyes may ap∣peare
with Bowes and Arrowes, and
to bee exercised with the Trayned
Bands, as more largely appeareth in
the Treatise; This I dre no further
vrge, but leave it to your owne Good∣nesse,
which can better direct, then I
an Imagine.
