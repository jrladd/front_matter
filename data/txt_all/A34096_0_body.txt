Most Serene King,
AS there is no such happy estate to be found in the affairs of men, wherein there is not some thing wanting: even so, that Happi∣ness of your Britany, with which your return to your ancient Kingdom (through the procurement of the right hand of the most High) hath blest it, is somewhat defaced, as by the overcast of a cloud: which yet, through the mercy of God, and your wise and pacifick Solomon-like moderation, there is life in our hopes may be dispelled: the Cloud (I mean) upon the Church of Christ amongst you, now by the blessing of God in a very flourishing
 condition, to which the sole controversie (viz. of the best Form of Church Government) vexatiously agitated for the space of one whole generation: doth even yet (although unani∣mous in the rest) threaten some distraction, un∣less both the Governors of the Churches a∣mong themselves, and your Self, (superintend∣ing, in Gods stead, the affairs of your World) together with the great Senate of your great Council, do prudently by moderate Counsels, dispose all things unto peace.
We Foraigners, in reverence to your Church (which the Everlasting Bridegroom hath deck∣ed for himself, with most excellent gifts, beyond many others) are onely able to pray for you: though yet we cannot but feel our selves ob∣liged unto more real offices of communion of Saints also, if any thing lay in our power, which might conduce thereunto. And indeed, some excellent Persons of your own, of both parts, have requested of me (who am the least in the House of God, yet amongst the Petitioners unto God on your behalf, not the last) some such thing; viz. To Communicate of what kinde the Government of our Churches hath been, ever since it hath been: if any thing may be received from thence which
 may be of use unto peace and edification, I have done it, communicated, and sent it, de∣dicated to your Church of Britain: But be∣cause it is not convenient, that matters which concern the publique good, be attempted by private persons, and the Great God hath ap∣pointed you, Great King, the Head of the Nations of your World, and the Umpire of differences, as also the Defender of his Church and Faith, I lay down this small Essay, what∣ever it is, at your Majesties Royal Footstool; most humbly beseeching, that you would be pleased to comend this endeavor in my name, to the busie sticklers of the said Controversie among you, that they may peruse it, and see if any thing may be gathered, even from thence, to the asswaging of animosities, and the en∣larging of good affections. But in the pub∣lique name of the Churches, and for the sake of Christ, I entreat, that your Majestie would not suffer this one onely remaining difference in your Churches, to burst out into a new Schism: for the glory of God, for the salvati∣on of the Church, for your Kingdoms and your own peace, for good example to the Churches of the whole world: So shall the King of Kings establish your Royal Throne,
 and bless your self, with your Family and Kingdoms, to flourish and endure.
To whose Eternal Protection, he with most earnest prayers commendeth your Majestie, who is
