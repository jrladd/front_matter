A Generall report (worthy Lord) of your ho∣nourable disposition bred in mee euen at my first cōming into France, an earnest desire to see you, which through your courtesy & my good fortune was happily effected: But when I perceiued with what vertuous industrie you indeauored to make the best vse, of your wel spent time, in those parts; I cōceiued great hope to receiue much greater contentment, in so truly honourable acquaintance, and the tast I had of your fauours assureth me I had beene happy in my hopes, had not my vntimely returne, such were my vnfortunate crosses, depriued mee of the com∣fort I tooke, in the company of your admired vertue. Notwith∣standing I haue hitherto fed my selfe with the hope of your re∣turne &c. Hoc equidem occasum Troiae tristesque rui∣nas solabor, this shall bee my refuge. In the meane time as Lewes of France did his country friends rape roote, or as the Percian King did the poore mans Apple, I intreat your Lordship to accept these sleight discourses as a token of the dutifull respect I owe you: They are I know most vnwor∣thy your Maiden patronage, yet my first fruites they bee, and I earnestly desire, that my first borne should beare your honours Name.
