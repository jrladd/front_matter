My very dear Friends,
THese Sermons were first Preached in your hearing; at your desire they become thus publick; which I should never have suffered them to have been, had I not hoped your spiritual good might be some way advanced thereby: For I am conscious that the World is already full of Books; yea, that divers have written on this very Subject, and that I am no ways capable of doing it so well, as it is done already: But your extraor∣dinary affection to my unworthy Person and Labours, may (by Gods blessing) make a meaner thing from me more acceptable, and so more useful to you,
 than the more Learned Labours of others that you are less acquainted with. My many infirmities both of body and mind, tell me, I am like to be of little use in the World; but what little I am capable (by Divine Assistance) of do∣ing for the glory of God, and the good of Souls, I am very desirous (if God see it good) it may henceforth be among you. For this little Book, I desire you will make it your Pocket companion; read it frequently, and practise it, and I shall have no cause (whatever censure it expose me to) to repent its Publication, nor you the Perusal of it. That your best good may be effectually promoted by this and all my poor endeavours, is the hearty prayer of
