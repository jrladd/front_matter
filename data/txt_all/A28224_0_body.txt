I Read in Plutarch of a  and a , of one that was a great lover of Alexander, as he was a brave accom∣plish'd man; and of another that was a lover of him as he was his true and lawful Sove∣raign: And without doubt to have a Prince both Good and Vertuous, Heroick and Magnani∣mous; Obliging to Subjects, Dreadful to Ene∣mies; Victorious at home and abroad, inso∣much that by his Goodness and Vertue he de∣serves the Title of being Great, it must be the Pride and Honour of us all: But if here we stick, and view not Majesty as well as good∣ness;

if we consider not his Power and his Place as well as his Merit and Desert, we may be  lovers of Alexander, but no  lovers of the King; and in truth no more qualifi'd to be Subjects, than was Phoe∣nix and Prothytes when they would have en∣franchis'd and Commonwealth'd the Thebans; than Demetrius and Nicanor when they would have set up Amyntas against him; than Cas∣sander and Jolla when waiting upon his Cup, they would have administred poyson to him. But,
Sir, It is Your Character (Craterum cum Hephaestione) so to love your King, as to be an admirer and asserter both of His Person and His Power, and with Heart and Hand equal∣ly to engage for both; A Loyalty, justly chal∣lenging aemulation as well as commendation, and which, in spight of all the Apostates of the age, is every mans great and bounden duty, as well as known to be Your firm and open pra∣ctice; and how far the County hath been in∣fluenc'd thereby, and the tide stemm'd even (when the raging flouds of a new found loyal∣ty had almost wash'd the old away) the present change of affairs may easily discover. Its enough for me that honest discourses might be vented

under You, and not threatned with the Pillory; that I could assert my Princes right, and not be told that my little learning had made me mad, or that my greater Loyalty (which is but my just tribute) had hurried me on to be a betrayer of my Religion: Wherefore if what here I offer, happen to be too hot for the age, and therefore censur'd; be pleas'd to blame Your self for calling me, first to the Pulpit, and now to the Press; for resolv'd I was, from the time you press'd me into your Service, and made me one of your retinue, to keep pace in daring Loyalty as near as I could unto your self; and shall ever study to abound in that vertue, as knowing, the more Loyal the more Christian, and far better qualified to be
Long-Melford, Suff. Sept. 9. 1683.
