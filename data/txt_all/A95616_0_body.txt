My Joy,
PRovidence, (that most Potent Byas of Mun∣daine affaires, inclin∣ing our actions, (as well the swarthy, lesse-commendable,
as most splendid) to a more prosperous end than our crooked, our oblique designes directs them.) That ever watchful, all-piercing eye (I say) extracting (in∣differently, its glory out of all our en∣terprises; When I [possibly] was soli∣citous of lesse-profitable discourses,French. in that Feminine-language) fixes my roving eye on Le Mispris du Monde, this, suddenly swells my drooping soul, with just indignati∣on, to contemne, what had too oft, too treacherously deceived, disap∣pointed, and (finally) disserted my fairest ambition; Thus, con∣verting my intended divertion to an inestimable treasure: This provi∣dence (I say) together with the delightful raptures, the satisfacti∣ons (if not benefit) I enjoy'd in the perusal first, and after in aiding this stranger to lisp, to stammer our native tong, ue who, (in his own)
had so aptly pourtraied the sober conceptions of my heart) that you, my Dear, might the more readily apprehend his worth;) thereby (at worst,) entertaining and deluding (as with a no-lesse faithful, than chearful and comfortable compani∣on) the sad solitudes of (otherwise) tedious minutes; And lastly, (my matchlesse moity) you, being con∣stantly the most worthy object, of my most immaculate inclinations; To you therefore (as well out of yours, and the Authors vertuous sympathy; as your interest in what is mine,) does this Essay most properly appertain, which (neverthelesse like a prodi∣gal spring, you may (without ex∣hausting your proper store) hereby, with some advantage communicate to the Common-Wealth of Piety) To you I say, does this Alien, (now a Denizon) addresse himself (fully satisfied of your civil reception of
persons of lesse merit) Imagine then you beheld him, in his native puri∣ty, (yet without Patron or Protector more than his innocent vertue,) om∣bellish't with such splendid linea∣ments, so fluently uttering that har∣monious dialect of Canaan, in such enchanting numbers, such soul∣charming straines, such bemoaning, such languishing accents; that whe∣ther you remark the subject, sub∣stance, design, elegant stile, or apt delivery; he is of more than ordina∣ry consideration: and no other than a product of divinity, since lesse than the inspirations of the Spirit of peace and joy, could not breath such fra∣grant aires, such ejaculations: But I may not ally, nor disparage his na∣tive value, with my imperfect com∣mendations, 'tis sufficient to passe him currant, that he bears your excellent image, and exact proporti∣on on his wealthy-Ore: And, (by the
permission of your fair (but frail) sex,) whom you surpasse as well in that rich, that glittering Jewel (that illustrates your amiable person) your gracious, and therefore glorious soul, as in your most exquisite outward frame, and cimetry, your body, that stately structure of the divine Archi∣tect, its most lovely Cabinet,) by your imploying and improving those minutes in the contemplation, and exercise of vertue, which others pro∣digally lavish and trifle out in a too passionate pursuite of the vain∣est extravagancies of the Authors Nation; yet now, dearest (though your strict severity, scarce permits you to imitate the most decent fashions of your all bright, all dazling sex,) be you in this (as in the other perfecti∣ons of your life) entirely consisting (as by long and happy experience I am confirm'd) in an unwearied exercise of vertue, and an imbred
and implacable aversion to vice) be, I say, not onely their Phair, their Mirrour for pre∣sent, for future generations to regulate, to adorne their illu∣strious soules by, in your Con∣tempt of the World; but here∣in my Dearest, give them the Mode, the Garb of the new Hie∣rusalem, converting their Ro∣mantick diversions, to Divine and World-contemning Con∣templations, exchanging their delights to sacrifices: march∣ing ever before them, as a No∣ble Heroesse, a brave Conduc∣tresse of the lovely Troop of silver Swannes, in that innocent via∣lactia of piety, that tends to a blessed eternity, that when the bodies gilt shall varnish, and fall off, you may together exalt your all-charming voyces, in chanting forth Hallelujahs to
him who was pleas'd to direct, and strengthen my weake hands to cleave wood for his Sanctu∣ary, and to adde my might to the treasure of those graces, that adorn thine incomparable person; attribute only what disgusts to me, who should want confidence, to intrude this on the World, but under your Banner; whose peculiar Function, and con∣stant Custome it is, to palliate, to ex∣tenuate, to cover the frequent infir∣mities of the hand that presents them, not as directions to, but as a character (rather) of your spotlesse conversation; neverthelesse, impre∣cating hereby (in some degree) it may supply, the other Defects, Disa∣bilities, and want of Industry, which his Relation oblidges him to, for your information, and instruction; in the perusal, you cannot (altogether) regrete your pains, nor remain un∣satisfied, with those reflections of
your own Pure spirit (whose motions are none other, than restlesse actions, tending to Holinesse and Righteous∣nesse, the honour of God, the com∣fort of Men (that parallel 'twixt his sayings, and your performances.) And, if the generality of men over∣passe this with neglect, with con∣tempt, yet Providence (when it shall be instal'd in your Oratory, that Sanctum Sanctorum of unsullied Devotions, your Closet) may be plea∣sed to move some curious eye, who may collect some word, some syllable that may faciliate his voy∣age to the City of my God; this ensuing Treatise, not onely wean∣ing men from the World, but gradually conducting them (in the five subsequent discourses) to life eter∣nal, through the gastly gate of death, not dreadful (though) to worthy Christians, but a rest from their labours: at worst, I may not
(altogether) dispair, but (here∣by) to fix a more than ordinary impression, on the spirits, of the tender productions, of our entire affection, our selves multiplied; who may, (as persons more near∣ly concerned, in their parents ac∣quisitions,) extract, what may advance their eternal well-fare; which if it fall out, as my Pro∣phetick soule whispers and sug∣gests, and my most frequent and fervent addresses to the Throne of Grace importune, I am abundant∣ly recompenc'd for my cordial in∣tentions, in thus exposing my self, to the censure of this choice pal∣lated generation: But, (my best blest soul) I may not longer de∣tain thee from what's more wor∣thy thy consideration, since it's an effect of his singular regard, whose terrestrial glory solely consists (in what renders him the object of o∣thers
envy) that perfect, and in∣dissolvable amity he contracted with thee, from that happy moment, he had the peculiar priviledge and felicity to subscribe, what he entirely is,
