RIGHT HONOURABLE,
THe boundlesse bond of sincere gratitude,
For savours multitude and magnitude,
My self and second doth so firmly tie
To you and your illustrious familie,
That what I can or do, or speak, or write,
Comes short of your demerits infinite.
Yet that I be not totally ingrate,
At least (at last) in minde to memorate,
What I and mine to you and yours do owe,
I long have longed, fitly forth to show.
And thus at length my hopes being happifi'de,
And kinde occasion caught, as soon as spi'de;
My humble hand and thankfull heart accords,
To you thrice noble and illustrious Lords,
To dedicate and consecate, as due,
My self, my service, and my all to you.
In this translated prince of poets rare,
Disrobed thus from's Latine vestures faire,
Into a home-spun english gray-coat plain,
Its vitall warmth, not worth, safe to maintain:
Yet in its self a princely poem sweet,
For your true princely patronage most meet;
Not for my manner, but its matters sake,
Wherein much various pleasure you may take.
Fully and fairely to affect and fit
Your pregnant promising, faire sprouting wit,
And cedar-like high growing noblenesse,
In learning, vertue, grace and godlinesse.
O as your yeares, so may these in you flourish,
Your king t' affect, the church and state to nourish!
So faire paire-royall of young nobles high,
Here to adorn, in heaven to glorifie.
Thus from his heart (best part) most humbly prayes
He, who in him and his doth rest alwayes
