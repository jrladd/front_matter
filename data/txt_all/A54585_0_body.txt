Gentlemen,
HAD I design'd to have publish'd this Sermon, or could I have foreseen I should have been requested to do it by you, it might have appear'd more correct, but you know my attendance on the Publick Service of the Church twice a Day, toge∣ther with the many other necessary Duties of so great a Garrison, left me but a very little time to provide for this which came so quick about; the constant performance of it being made necessary oftentimes each Week by the many subtle Contrivances, and cunning Devices of the Romish Priests to corrupt and debauch your Principles of Religion, and Al∣legiance; and amongst many others their great Di∣ligence they employed this way to seduce you from your bounden Duties to God, and Their Majesties; these, with the great sincerity of my intentions of do∣ing my utmost to promote God's Glory, the good of the Church, and Their Majesties interest among you,

I hope may apologize for those Defects which shall be obvious to you in the reading, that might perhaps escape you in the hearing: Now God grant that these, with all my other well design'd, though mean Performances among you, may produce their inten∣ded and much wish'd for Effects. Though the Scan∣dal that the extravagant Looseness and Liberties of of some among you hath brought upon so honourable and noble a Profession be very great, and much to be lamented; yet I must do you so much justice as to own to the World, that I have ever found among many of you, a great readiness to encourage the meanest En∣deavours tending to the Promotion of any of the afore∣mention'd ends, viz. God's Glory, the good of the Church, and Their Majesties interest; of which a∣mongst many others, your earnest Requests for the printing of this following Discourse, are a sufficient Instance, and my Compliance with them the greatest I can give of my being what you shall find me on all Occasions,
Gentlemen,
From Gant, May the 30. N. S. 1694.
