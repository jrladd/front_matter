THE dignity of this Subject may without ambition aime at an higher Dedication, and the Dignity of some of your places may well Pa∣tronize a more learned worke: Although the Relation we all have to either may wel challenge, I no other Patron, and You all e∣ven this Dedication. In as much
 as the poore endeavours it is of a Minister of the Gospell of Christ, in one of the Parishes within your Liberty: the desire of all whose welfare, as you have indifferent Authority in all the places with∣in your Liberty, do I next tender to those o mine own Parish. Who though not all my equall charge yet my carefull endeavour, that should principally redoundo those of my own charge, I do not bound, but shall be glad if it may goe out into a blessing to the good also of others, and next to those of my owne Parish, to all others within this ancient Corporation. When this worke though meane in shew (for I studyed therin both brevi∣ty & plainesse) is but the grounds & epitome of many years exercises
 among you: when what by sermons I have somtimes preached to your ears, I now present to your eyes, & wish may be imprinted in your hearts: that being intended for the education of children & servants by instruction of Parents & Ma∣sters may happily teach both, and so abandon that hateful ignorance that for want of such like instru∣ctions by Catechisme hath too much crept in among us Besides that after so many years living a∣mong you (considering the uncer∣tainty both o life and living) my desire is that this small peece thus framed for your use, may re∣main with you as a testimony of my good-will, and well wishes to your souls good. And so commending you to God, I rest
