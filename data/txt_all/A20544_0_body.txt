SIr, your louing acceptance of our former treatise, together with the good entertainement which it hath found with many christian readers, hath much encouraged vs to dedicate this also to your fauourable patronage. Wee are now more willing to make some work for the presse, because we haue no imployment in the pulpit. And who knoweth but that others (whom God hath gra∣ced with far greater sufficiencie) may bee stirred vp heereby, to publish some of their godly meditations: that as their faithfull labours were formerly like pure fountaines, which did onely refresh their particular congregations: so now, by meanes of printing, they may bee made like great and comfortable riuers, to water the whole land.
And whereas we and our families haue plentiful∣ly tasted of your goodnesse and mercie, we thought it our bounden duties to manifest our vnfained thankefulnesse for the same: that other Patrons may
 be moued by your example, to shew the like com∣passion to their distressed Ministers, that you haue done to vs and ours, if our successe fall out accor∣ding to our hope, we purpose (by Gods assistance) to proceed further in this booke of the Prouerbs, in the same methode which is heere already begun, if other∣wise: yet this is our comfort, that it hath beene, and is our continuall care, and hearts desire, to keepe a good conscience, and to recompence our present si∣lence with the best seruice that we are able to per∣forme vnto the Church. The God of all mercie and comfort, multiplie his gracious blessings vpon you more and more, and graunt all peace and prosperitie to all those that faithfully loue and seeke, the peace of the Church, and the prosperitie of the Gospell.
