GENTLEMEN,
THIS being the first Essay of our in this kind, and being parâˆ£ticularly
obliged to you for your Assistance herein, (in perusing
several of the Songs of this Book before they went to the Press,
whose Authors we could not so well apply our selves to, and adding
Thorow-Basses to such as wanted them) we presume farther
on your Generosity, and beg the favour of you to patronize
these our Endeavours; and also to give us leave to acknowledge our selves,
(as in Gratitude bound)
