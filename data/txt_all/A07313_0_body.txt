THrise hopefull CHARLES, gracefull ELIZABETH
Great Britaines Hearts-ioy, Europs brightest beames
Lo what my Muse, though mournfull, mused hath
In laud of our late Lilly of Saint IAMES:
All Europes obiect, and the flowre of Knights,
Mirrour of man-hood, wonderment of wights.


The Life of him whom euery heart did loue,
The Death of him whome each heart doth condole
These lines doe limme, while Christ him crownes aboue;
And that his fame far flee's twixt Pole and Pole:
This duties Birth I trust ye will it take
In the best worth, for worthy HENRIES sake.
