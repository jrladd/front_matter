My very good Lord,
BEing informed of a Book which passed the decreto∣rial sentence against our Church, and that it was written by an Author grave and sober, whose reason was very keen and sharp, one who was the Coryphaeus of the Roman Party, and therefore from whom I might expect all that the mat∣ter could well bear; one lastly who was once a professed son of the Church of Eng∣land, and therefore would not be so ungrate∣ful to his Mother as to pass so heavy a doom upon her without the greatest evidence, and conviction; I first set upon perusing it, big with expectations, but finding my self mi∣serably
disappointed, I was put into such a passion, as vented it self into this Reply, which humbly lies prostrate at your Lord∣ships feet, begging the favour and honour of your acceptance, and that you would be pleased to take it into your protection. And indeed what can be more proper then to commit a discourse of this nature to the pro∣tection of such a Father of the Church, whose zeal for the Churches good is as ardent, as her enemies rage and fury violent? What there∣fore my former promises of tendering my first fruits unto your Lordship, and the influ∣ence of your instructions and encouragement have made your own, flies to the shelter of your goodness, where leaving it, I secure∣ly rest,
