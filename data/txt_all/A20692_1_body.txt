G. Eastland. To I. Dowlands Lute.

LVte arise and charme the aire,
Vntill a thousand formes shee beare,
Coniure them all that they repaire,
Into the circles of hir eare,
Euer to dwell in concord there,


By this thy tunes may haue accesse,
Euen to hir spirit whose flowring treasure,
Doth sweetest Harmonie expresse,
Filling all eares and hearts with pleasure
On earth, obseruing heauenly measure,
Right well can shee Judge and defend them,
Doubt not of that for shee can mend them.
