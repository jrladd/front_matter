I Haue presumed (which I haue lōg purposed) to offer vnto your Honor: some poore token of that dutie, which bindeth mee vnto your
Lordship, while life la∣steth: hauing gotten some fit occasiō to expresse my loue, I thought not to pre∣termit the same; but ther∣in to shew my minde and poore abilitie, wherein I may doe your Honor any seruice. Therefore after I had yeelded to publish this Sermon, I remembred the blessed & holie Euan∣gelist Saint Luke, penning and publishing the hea∣uenly storie and blessed Gospel of Iesus Christ, did dedicate the same to one Theophilus, a noble man of
singular credit and autho∣ritie; which moued me to make choice of your Ho¦nour, to become a Patron & refuge vnto my poore and simple meditations, in a Sermon preached at Paules Crosse (as the title sheweth): and is a Treatise tending to sanctification: which, according to the time, I haue, amongst o∣thers, brought my present; and (as I hope) contrarie to Mithridates sword, is more pretious and richer within, then it is without: and which, with the New
yeere, as a New-yeeres gift, I humbly present vn∣to your Lordship, that vnder the shadow of your Honorable acceptance, it may finde some rest and reliefe. To whom being diligently read, and often meditated vpon, I doubt not, but it will be fruitfull to inflame a zeale of Gods glorie, and furtherance of his religion.
Wherefore my humble desire is, your Honour would vouchsafe the pa∣tronage hereof, & then (I doubt not but) more lear∣ned
then my selfe will ac∣cept my good will; and good men will helpe mee with their prayers to God, for the encrease of his grace, to the further inlo∣ging of the kingdome of his holy sonne Iesus.
Now the very God of peace sanctifie your Ho∣nour throughout, and in the perusing hereof, to measure the commenda∣tion, to the glorie of God, by the liking and feeling of your own heart: so shal I haue what I desire, and my paines shall bee more
then sufficientlie recom∣pēced. Praying vnto God that you may liue long, to the benefit of your Coun∣trie, the aduancement of your Honour, the com∣fort of learning; and a∣boue all, that your whole spirit, and soule and bodie may bee kept blamelesse, vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, to his glorie, who shall glorifie you in the Heauens.
Amen.
