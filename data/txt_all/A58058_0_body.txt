IT is the unavoidable Desti∣ny
of some to be highly ob∣lig'd
by those, to whom
their good Fortune has made
them any thing particularly
known. Not that those Fa∣vours
are to be attributed to
ought of more than ordinary
Merit on their side, by whom
they were received; but purely
to that Munificence and Tran∣scendency
of Generosity, which

is so predominant in certain per∣sons,
that they cannot forbear
endeavouring to render the Con∣ditions
of those, whom they once
take notice of, more comfortable
then they found them.
That these have been my very
Circumstances, I have had occa∣sion
heretofore to acknowledge
to others; and I am now to
make the same Acknowledg∣ment
to your self, from whom,
in my most pressing Exigencies,
I have receiv'd such seasonable
Reliefs, as give me just cause to
celebrate the Liberalities of so
great a Benefactor.
As to the small Piece which
this humble Address ushers to

your hands, I find it without any
Author's Name prefix'd thereto.
Of which Concealment of him∣self,
as also of his Design in the
ensuing INSTRUCTIONS,
since he has given an Account in
a particular Preface, I thought fit
to give the English Reader the sa∣tisfaction
of that too, that they
who shall henceforth concern
themselves in the publishing of
any thing by way of History, may
take their Measures from this lit∣tle
Treatise, and before they go
any further, compute the Sacred∣ness
and Extent of their Under∣taking.
I have onely to add the retri∣butory
Devotions of such as are
highly sensible how highly they

are oblig'd, and to pray for the
Continuation of a Life and
Health, which has been so bene∣ficial
to several Persons, and par∣ticularly
to,
Honoured Sir,
Your most Humble, and
much obliged Servant,
