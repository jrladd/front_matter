MOst Noble, and Right worthie Senate; Moses telleth us, that when God had commanded him to make the Tabernacle and all the in∣struments thereof; accor∣ding to the patterne which he had shewed him in the Mount, he bad him withall, to speake unto the children of Israel, to bring for the buil∣ding thereof, gold, silver, brasse, silke, purple, scarlet, fine linnen, goates haire, rammes skinnes, &c. Of all whichthings, every one

whose harts moved them willingly, brought presently a free offering to the Lord: All which materialls were delivered by Moses, to the workemen called by God, and by him appointed to doe the worke. Who were Betsalcel, Aholiab, and all other wise-hearted men, in whom God had put wisedome, to make all that hee had commanded him. This Tabernacle; and like∣wise the Temple by Salomon were but types of the new Jerusalem, which commeth downe out of Heaven from God. About the building whereof, you, Worthies of the Lord, beeing now employed, by the like calling and appointment, And having to the very same end, printed of late and published, an order for all peoples, nations, and tongues living under the Dominions of our Sove∣raigne; by which you gave them to understand, that you earnestly desired, and expected that all ingenious persons in every Countrey of the Kingdome should be very active to im∣prove the present opportunitie, by giving a true information of the state and condition of all the Parishes in their severall Counties, concerning preaching Ministers, &c. In o∣bedience to which I made all speede possible to bring a small free-will offering, which as I suppose may somewhat conduce and serve for the furthe∣rance

and effecting of the said building. It is a parcell of Gold, which though it be but in ore, yet is already judged, by the touch of it, to the true stone of triall, the Scripture; to be purer then that anciently so much renowned, of Ophir; or that overmuch now prised, of that new discovered world. It was found of late, digging (under hard Taske-masters and detainers of hire) with a com∣pany of hard labouring yoke-fellowes: who for the space of these five and twenty yeares past, have night and day digged, at that goldenpit of the Re∣velation of Saint John, to discover the most rich and glorious mysteries hidden therein. A veine whereof, having but lately opened, it gave present∣ly great hope and assurance of most rich treasures, lying yet further and deeper, which may now with some more labour be attained unto, (if the worke be continued, and necessarie tooles, with convenient furniture be supplied and furnished for the same) for the furthering of the said spirituall building, the perfect model whereof is therein most excel∣lently set out and described. I thought therfore that I was in most humble dutie bound, this day being a day of good tidings, to hold no longer my peace in concealing of the same, but that I was to acquaint first of all your honours, as being they to whom it concernes now most, in presenting here∣with

a proofe therof: the which though it be wrap∣ped up in a very course, yea borrowed cloath, yet contemne it not therefore, no more then Christ did the two mites of the poore widow, it procee∣ding also from a sincere heart. Your acceptance therof will sett many more at work about the same pit, which will furnish worke enough for all and the best, with a bundance of most rich spiritualltrea sure, necessarie for the perfecting of the foresaid building. It will very much encourage my fore∣mentioned  to follow hard the said worke, when they shall see me returning to them furni∣shed with an authenticall approbation and autho∣rising of their said labour in the said worke of the Lord, being with all furnished, by your most equi∣table justice, and Parliamentarie authority with a lawfull power and necessarie implements to work with them in my former station in the said taske, without any more feare or danger of interruption by any Sanballats or Tobiahs. The which favour of yours shall oblige for ever
