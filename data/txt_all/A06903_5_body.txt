THere is not any pleasure (Gentlemē) in the iudgement of my sence, which I can allow to be held equall with hunting, both for the full satisfaction it giues to the minde and bodie, and also for the noble figures and imitations it carries in the exercise of the delight, as long as it is accompained with his true mem∣bers, which is a readie sent; perfit Dogs, and aboue all a pure winded horse: for if he be wanting, the other not ob∣seruing the leasure of your foote-steps, wil flie so fast from you, that there will be left nothing but imagination to con∣tent you; which to preuent, and that you may enioy your delight without impeachment, I haue publisht this work; which being purposely framde for a general good, and not a priuat vse (as my first little treatise was) wil (I doubt not) giue you all that reasonable satisfaction, which is requisite to be desired eyther in this or any thing belonging to this part of horsemanship, wherein as you shall reape profit, so let me bee repaid with thankes, that when you haue what you wish, I may not want what I desire: and so farwell.
