THe greatest and most excellent name which the famous Poet Virgil could finde out where∣with to adorne the most renown'd King Picus, was to call him a horseman: & that the Pega∣sian horse was not onelie fayned to be begotten by the son of Neptune, but also to be the first founder of the learned Wel and the arte of memorie: then I doubt not but this famous Arte of horse manship, which with my best inde∣uours I haue carefully collected, wil in your graces moste noble thoughts finde both defence and acceptance; and rather sith it is an Arte wherin I holde your grace as excellent as any prince in Christendome; & is such on ornament of state, that there is no actiue greatnes vnblemished which pleadeth absolute ig∣norance in so royal a professiō. Now albe this part of horsemā, ship, which I consecrate to your noble name, be not contained within the rules or principles of the Iralian or french riders (who albe they can ride wel, yet are ignorant how to make a horse ride long) yet your grace whose daylye experience and knowledge both of the worth and vse of these hunting horses can best iudge the profit of the art as wel in pleasure, as in vr∣gent occasiōs wil I hope neither esteeme my labour vaine, nor fruitlesse, for the cuntrie wherin I liue: & strengthning that hope with the noble fauours which you extend to your admi∣rers, I liue to be commaunded by you.
