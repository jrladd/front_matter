Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull,
THis Sermon being preach't by your joynt-motion (and Printed by more then a single one) hath em∣bolden'd me to make this joynt Dedication. These words were not spoken in a corner, neither be∣ing spoken doe they seeke corners, unlesse it be the cor∣ners of mens hearts, any other (Verits non quaerit) Truth seeks not. While I put this, but into your hands, t' other is the lodging I desire for it. In these Endow∣ments of a King, see what your selves (in your spheare) aught to have: In the Duty of a King here presented, reade what your selves (in your spheare) aught to doe.
 Every Magistrate is a King in a small Letter. You Act (on the Stage of this Ancient City) the part of a Great King; Therefore you need the Parts of a King. And though now (while you act for King and Parlia∣ment) a Cloud of misconstruction dwels upon some of your Loyallties: yet trust God (God who gathers the wind in his fists, and sends it out when he plea∣seth) trust him for the scattering of that Cloud; and the causing of your Innocency to breake forth as the light, and your just dealing as the Noone-day. Sow to your selves, Governe others in righteousnesse: And feare not, but your City shall bring forth Peace to the people, Good-will to your selves, or (which is farre better, then both, though alone) Glory to God on High. To the care of this High God I commit this City, your Per∣sons, and your Imployments, and am
SIRS
