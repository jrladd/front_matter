Gentlemen,
THe Preaching of this Sermon was undertaken at the request of the High Sheriff, an Honest, True-hearted and Loyal Gentleman, an Ancient and Faithful Servant to His Majesty: But the Printing of it was extorted by Your importunity; You have thrust me into the World perfectly against my humour and inclination; and You have thereby expos'd me to the exceptions and censures of this captious Age, of peevish, ill-natur'd, and ill-affected Persons: To You therefore I flee for shelter; Your Protection I claim, on Your judgements I have relyed: You are bound in Honour and Justice to excuse the Faults of this Discourse; to vindicate the Truths, to justifie the Doctrine, and to abhor the Perjuries herein mention'd.
I have some encouragement to hope, that the Sermon will please the honest, the Faithful and the Loyal, be∣cause
it pleases you, who are eminently such; that it may be in some degree useful and seasonable for these Times, because You think so: And if it chance to be carp't and cavell'd at by the Factious and the Seditious; by false Witnesses, and corrupt Jurors, by the Old Cove∣nanters, or New Associators, as being peculiarly levell'd against their Designs and Practises; Yet however we need not fear, we have this advantage upon them, that whoever rail, or even mutter against us, do thereby confess their own guilt; and so their Credit is crack't, and their Testimony becomes invalid; Their Tongues are no Slander, their ill-words are no Disparagement; no more, than their good ones can be a Commendation.
My Design in Preaching, and Yours in Publishing this Discourse, I dare confidently say, were both the same; To Convince the Guilty, and make them truly sensible of their Sin and Danger, in order to their Re∣pentance: And to fix and 'stablish the slippery and wa∣vering Tempers of those, who are apt to be drawn in by great Examples, or specious Pretences, or the Pros∣pect of temporal Advantages.
That our joynt Endeavours may prove, by God's blessing, useful and instrumental to these great and good Ends, shall be the hearty Prayer of,
Gentlemen,
