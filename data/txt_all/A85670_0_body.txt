My Lord,
I Am bold, by vertue of your Patronage, to ex∣pose this small Tract to the publique View and Censure of the World. It's Refuge is the sanctuary of your Name; the Result amounting to no more then a persuasive hope of Se∣curity from the contagious emissions of that universal Basilisk, Detraction: and, by the indulgence of your favour and acceptation, will triumph over self-martyring envy. I presume not to present it to your judicious aspect, as

that your Honour should learn any thing by the act of one in the April of years & literature, as I am; but hoping that if at any your recreatory houres, you shall grace it with the view of your discerning eye, you may observe some∣thing in it that may conduce to publick utility. I might well fear my rudeness should offend your Honorable survey; but that it is your nobleness rather to smile at the errors committed by young heads, then censure them. However I humbly crave your Lordships par∣don for presenting things so unworthy your view, and to accept of them as an incourager of my meane endeavours, who shall ever continue
