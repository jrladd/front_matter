IT is a thing of ve∣rie great conside∣ration (Right Ho∣norable) to behold The Woonderfull worke of almightie God, in strengthe∣ning and preser∣uinge those that continuallie fight for the defence of the true & sincere Religion of Christ Iesus: as hath beene seene within this Island, which in com∣parison to the worlde, is but as a handfull: yet is the same so defended (by the prouidence of almightie God) from spoiling & subuerting, that neither forrain practises abroad, nor ciuil discord, or priuy pretended treasons at home, or the inuasiō of the mightiest enemie can once preuaile against it: as hath of

late yeares bene manifested, to the great amazement, ouer∣throwe, and confusion of the chiefest complotters of such bad actions. And this (right Honorable) is not seene onely in this Island, but generallie euen in all Nations, Cities, or Townes, where Gods truth is aduanced, preached, & preferred before Idolatrie and superstition: as appeareth by that famous City of Geneua, where God is rightlie honoured, and his worde sincerelie preached. Of which Cittie, (right Honourable) this discourse ensuing trulie describeth, and aswell laieth open their troubles, sustained by the inuasion of the Duke of Sauoy and his forces, for the time of these three years, as also the bat∣tels and vnlooked for victories which almightie God hath giuen the Cittizens of Geneua, against the Sauoyans theyr deadlie enemies: Thus presenting the saide discourse vnto your Honours, beeing trulie published in the English tongue, according to the French Co∣pie, I humblie take my leaue.
