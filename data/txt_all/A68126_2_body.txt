MADAME, J know your Christian ingenuitie such, that you will not grudge others the com∣munication of this your priuate right: which yet J durst not haue presumed to aduenture, if I feared that either the benefit of it would be lesse, or the acceptation. Now it shall be no lesse yours: onely it shall be more knowne to be yours. Ʋouchsafe therefore to take part with your worthy Husband, of these my sim∣ple Meditations. And if your long and gracious experience haue written you a larger volume of wholesome lawes, and better infor∣med you by precepts fetcht from your owne feeling, than J can hope for, by my bare speculation: yet where these my not vnlikely rules shall accord with yours, let your redoubled assent allow them, and they confirme it. J made them not for the eie, but for the heart: neither doe J commend them to your reading, but your practice: wherein also it shall not be enough that you are a meere and ordina∣ry agent, but that you be a patterne propounded vnto others imi∣tation. So shall your vertuous and holy progresse, besides your owne peace and happpinesse, be my Crowne and reioycing, in the Day of our common appearance. Halsted. Decemb. 4.
