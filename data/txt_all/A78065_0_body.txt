TO all Emperours, Kings, Princes, Rulers, Iudges, Magistrates, and Powers throughout the earth, after what name or Title soever mentioned, with all Ministers and people, high, low, rich, poore, noble, and ignoble, and thou Israel amongst the rest, throughâˆ£out the whole inhabitable parts of the world, do I send greeting, with a word (Behold the King of Kings is coming now with Clouds to visit you) and by and by with light.
