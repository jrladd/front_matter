Comptus honos, honor est Comptono, & Compton honore.

THou, that rock'st comely honour in thine armes,
Thou patr to the child-house of my vayne,
Thou hiue vnto the Museshony swarmes,
And Godfather to th'issue of my braine,
To thee, Baptizer of mine infant lines,
With golden water in a siluer Font:
Thy bountie, goldâ–ª thy finger siluer twines,
Siluering my papers inke, as they were wont.
To thee (the bloudy Christall of a Ghost,
Wrapt in a fierie web) I spin to thee.
To thee, (the thawer of Dianaes frost:
Tarquin the hotte in Lucrece Tragedie.)
To thee I consecrate these ashie fires,
She quencht in bloud, he burnt in his desires.
