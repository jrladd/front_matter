Most Equal Sisters,
NEver did any Volume raise it selfe to that heighth of reputation, at once to purchase every Reader for a friend or favourite: it is a known truth, and not to be denied that our Language hath in these later Ages been advanced to the admiration, if not the emu∣lation, of other Nations, and whatsoever un∣natural reproaches have been stuck upon her beauties by the petulancy of Criticks, hath strangely, but chiefly, proceeded from the unworthy attempts of those that have obtruded on this Age their transcriptions of Indexes, rather then Dictionaries, as if our Language were narrower then the rest of the Worlds, or to be confined to their short-hand Epitomes: A high mis∣carriage through which the learned and unlearned have most unhappily suffered; certainly the Regalia of our Language could not have been worse injured then by being vitiated and corrupted by such spurious and imperfect Editions: for

if the Grandeur of such an undertaking be rightly considered, no ordinary industry will be required, next the consulting with the Monuments of ancient Records and Manuscripts de∣rived to us from reverend Authours, there will be occasion to peruse the Works of our ancient Poets, as Geffry Chaucer the greatest in his time, for the honour of our Nation; as also some of our more Modern Poets, as Spencer Sidny, Drai∣ton, Daniel, with our Reformers of the Scene, Johnson, Shake∣sphear, Beaumont, and Fletcher, and among the renowned An∣tiquaries, Cambden, Lambard, Spelman, Selden, and divers others▪ There will also be exacted from him that undertakes a task of this nature, a necessary knowledge of the Languages in which he is certain to incounter with a multitude of Criticisms, nor must he be wanting in his strictest search of most Dictionaries, that he may be able to distinguish the terms, several derivations, differences, definitions, interpretations, proper significations of the words of our Tongue, how borrowed, how mixed with others, how with its own. Lastly, forraign Authours are to be made use of, and amongst them, the Germans are reputed most expert in the Mechanical Arts.
Thus, ever Honoured Sisters, you are not unacquainted what Siftings, Anvelings, Traversings, there ought to be of Au∣thours▪ so that he that undertakes this Enterprize should first seriously perpend what difficulties he is to passe through, how dangerous it is for him to faile in such a Design, what a weight of disparagement he is likely to sink under: a Volume of this nature being of no lesse concernment, then not onely to informe young men in their deficiencies of the right knowledge of words, either for writing or dis∣course, but also to establish those of riper years in their pru∣dentials as an universally through-pac't Dictionary, and may serve for an Interpreter or Arbiter of their Studies and hu∣mane Transactions; so that a work thus rightly constituted may be said in some kind, to approach near to a Divine Skill, and that the rather as it doth in it selfe contain all those Idea's that concern the Speech or Pen, such as are use∣full to drive on and inforce with full vigour and strength, the affaires of mankind.
Illustrious Sisters, if we look upon the exemplary incourage∣ments

of some of our Laureate Worthies, whose noble spirits have not suffered the ashes of Antiquity to be raked out of her sacred Urnes, as at this time the admired Workes of Mr. Dodsworth and of Mr. Dugdale have informed the World. Some of these Heroick Persons out of a farther zeal to pre∣serve our Language from the barbarismes and ruinous defor∣mities of the times, to present her in her native glories, from their own more pracical and experienc't insights in some of the Arts and Sciences, have contributed in what they were more particularly excellent, to the building up of this Volume▪ Their names I have affixed to their own learned indeavours, not onely as I my self acknowledge their opportune and incompa∣rable assistances, but that the Bookseller so much obliged to them for so unusual a curtesie, might expresse his humblest tenders of gratitude; as also that you, most Noble Sisters, would be pleased to take notice of this your learned Retinue▪ and that there are Benefactours still surviving to celebrate your flourish∣ing felicities.
I am not ignorant, that though I am thus fortified with the pregnant aid of those exquisite Persons, to which my own in∣feriour, though studious indeavours are joyned, that I shall ne∣verthelesse fall short of answering the curiosities of some critical expectations. Mr. Minshaw that spent his life and estate in scrutinizing into Languages, still remaines obnoxious to the misconstructions of many. But let such invading cen∣surers well consider the infinity of mechanical words, how e∣very Art hath its peculiar Terms, and then if they are in their right wits, it will seem almost impossible to them, for one man though a healthful person that hath spent the best part of the lea∣sure of his life, to erect such a Pyramid▪ more especially if those difficulties are rightly pondered that are to be waded through▪ the conduct of costs in that continued converse that must be had with Artists, besides the great labour, with which the most generous For∣rainers that have gone about to manage such happy designs, have been wasted and tired out; these considerations being ingeniously weighed by the wiser sort of men, I hope the learned & charitable Critick will intertain a favourable approbation of these labours, as he cannot find me wanting, at least of a more than ordinary in∣dustry to compleat this Work, both in examining and right di∣gestion

of my own papers, as also for that tender care that hath been had of those happy contributions I received from others. Most Reverenced Sisters, my greatest ambition is your affecti∣onate esteem, which having but obtained, I shall ever strive to imploy the best strength of my life and studies in your service; in the mean space I question not but I have already done my Country so much good service as to have stript away those ob∣solete termes that have defaced our language, not degrading too much from its primitive integrity, nor declining what with judge- I might insert.
To conclude, I have illustrated and refined it, instated it in its proper majesty, rendred it admirably useful for all persons on all occasions, worthy of the greatest masteries of Rhetoricians and the tongues of our Vernaculous Oratours: with a no lesse honour∣able submission have I prostrated these my Indeavours at your Learned Feet.
