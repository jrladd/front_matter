TEnder Reader, knowing how much youth∣full yearts delight in eating early fruit, (though green and so unwholsome) I therefore here present thee with a dish of early fruit, (yet mature and ripe, and therefore no whit dan∣gerous to thy greedy stomack,) therefore accept it willingly and (with safety) fall to with courage.
And much good may it do thee.
Onely let me request thee to use civill behaviour in thy so doing: be sober, be serious, read under∣standingly, apply diligently, and practise consciona∣bly the precepts here given thee.
For thy good profit and incouragement, I have vouchsafed to expresse my self unto thee; what thou hast heard of me, by me, in me, and from me, do therefore and take all in Love from him, that seeks most heartily (and with the strength of his Soul) thy eternal wellfare and Gods glory in thee.
Ely July. 1656.
