Sheweth.
THat no Government is more just in the Constitution, then that of Parliaments, having its foundation in the free choice of the People, and as the end of all govern∣ment is the safety and freedme of the governed, even so the people of this Nation in all times have manife∣sted most hearty affections unto Parliaments, as the most proper remedies of their grievances, yet such hath been the wicked pollicy of those who from time to time have indeavoured to bring this Nation in∣to bondage, that they have an all times either by the dsuse or abuse of Par∣liaments, deprived the people of their hopes; for testimony whereof, the late times foregoing this Parliament will sadly witnesse, when 'twas not only made a crime to mention a Parliament, but either the pretended Ne∣gative voice (the most destructive to freedome) or a speedy dissolution blasted the fruit and benefit thereof, whilest the whole Land was over∣spread with all kind of oppression and tyranny, extending both to soule and body, and that in so rooted and setled a way, that the complaint of the people in generall witnessd, that they would have given any thing in the world for one six moneths freedome of Parliament which hath been si evi∣denced in their instant and constant readinesse of assistance to this present Parliament, exceeding the Records of all former ages, and wherein God hath blessed them with their first desire, making this Parliament most free and absolute of any Parliament that ever was, and inabling it with
 power sufficient to deliver the whole Nation from all kind of oppression and grievance, though of never so long continuance and to make it the most ab∣solute and free nation in the world.
And it is most thankefully acknowledged, that you have in order to the freedome of the people, suppressed the High-Commission, Star-Chamber, and Councell Table, called home the banished, delivered such as were imprisoned for matters of conscience, and brought some Delinquents to deserved punishment; that you have suppressed the Bishops and popish Lords, abolished Episcopacy, and that kind of prelatick and persecuting government, that you have taken away Ship-money, and all new illegall Patents whereby the hearts of all the well-affected were inlarged, and fil∣led with a confident hope, that they should have seen long ere this a com∣pleat removall of all grievances, and the whole people delivered from all oppression over soule or body. But such is our misery, that after the ex∣pence of so much precious time, blood, and treasure, and the ruine of so ma∣ny thousands of honest Families, in recovering our liberty. Wee still find the Nation oppressed with grievances of the same destructive nature as for∣merly though under other notions, and which are so much the more grie∣vous unto us, because they are inflicted in the very time of this present Par∣liament under God) the hope of the oppressed; For as then all the men and women in England, were made liable to the Summons, Attachments, Sentences, and imprisonments of the Lords of the Councell boord, so wee find by wofull experience, and the suffering of many particular persons, that the present Lords doe assume and exercise the same power, then which no∣thing can be more repugnant and destructive to the Commons just liberty. As then the unjust power of the Starchamber was exercised in compelling men and women to answer to interrogatories tending to accuse themselves and others, so is the same now frequently practised upon divers persons, even your cordiall friends, that have been, and still are punished for re∣fusing to answer questions against themselves, and neerest relations. As then the great oppression of the High-Commission, was most evident in molesting of godly peaceable people for non-conformity, or different opinion, or practice in religion, in judging all who were contrary-minded to them∣selves, to bee Hereticks, Sectaries, Schismatiques, seditious, factious, enemies to the State, and the like; and under great penalties, forbidding all persons not licensed by them to preach or publish the Gospell; even so now at this day, the very same, if not greater molestations are set on foot, and
 violently prosecuted by the instigation of a Clergy, no more infallible then the former, to the extreme discouragement & affliction of many thousands of your faithfull adherents, who are not satisfied that controversies in religion can be trusted to the compulsive regulation of any, & after the Bishops were suppressed, did hope never to have seen such a power assumed by any in this Nation any more. And although all new illegall Patents are by you abo∣lished, yet the oppressive Monopoly of Merchant adventurers, and others do still remain, to the great abridgement of the liberty of the people, and to the extreame prejudice of all such industrious people, as doe depend on Clothing, or woollen manufacture, it being the staple commodity of this Kingdom and Nation, and to the great discouragement and disadvantage of all sorts of Trades-men, Seafaring-men, and hinderance of Shipping, and Navigation. Also the old tedious and chargeable way of deciding Con∣troversies, or suits in law is continued to this day, to the extreme vexation, and utter undoing of multitudes of Families (a grievance as great and pal∣pable as any in the world) that old and most unequall punishment of male∣factors, is still continued, whereby mens lives and liberties are as liable to the lawes corporall paines as much inflicted for small, as for great offences, and that most, most unjustly upon the testimony of one Witnesse, contrary both to the law of God and common equity, a grievance very great) but lit∣tle regarded; And also Tithes and other inforced maintenance are still continued, though there be no ground for either under the Gospel, and though the same have occasioned multitudes of suits, quarrells and debates both in former and latter times. In like manner multitudes of people, poore distres∣sed prisoners for debt, lye still unregarded, in a most miserable and wofull condition throughout the Land, to the great reproach of this Nation; Like∣wise Prison-keepers or Jaylors are as presumptuous as ever they were both in receiving and detaining of prisoners, illegally committed, as cruell and inhumane to all, especially to such as are well-affected, as oppressive and ex∣torting in their Fees, and are attended with under Officers of such vile and unchristian demeanour, as is most abominable; Also thousands of men and women are permitted to live in beggery and wickednesse all their life long, and to breed their children to the same idle and vitious course of life, and no effectuall meanes used to reclaime either, or to reduce them to any vertue or industry.
And last as those who found themselves agrieved formerly at the bur∣dens and oppressions of those times, that did not conforme to the Church
 government then established, refused to pay Ship-mony, or yeild obedience to unjust Patents, were reviled and reproached with Nick-names of Pu∣ritans, Hereticks, Schismaticks, Sectaries, or were termed factions or seditious, men of turbulent spirits, despisers of government, and disturbers of the publike peace; even so it is at this day, in all respects with those, that shew any sensibility of the fore-recited grievances, or move in any manner or measure, for remedy thereof, all the reproaches, evills, and mischiefs that can be devised, are thought too few, or too little to be layd upon them, as Round-heads, Sectaries, Independants, Hereticks, Schismaticks, facti∣ous, seditious, Rebellious, disturbers of the publike peace: destroyers of all civill relations, and subordinations, yea, and beyond what was former∣ly, non-conformity is now judged a sufficient cause to disable any person (though of known fidelity) from bearing any offices of trust in the Com∣mon-wealth, whiles Neuters, malignant and disaffected, are admitted and countenanced; and though it be not now made a crime to mention a Par∣liament, yet it is little lesse to mention the supreme power of this Honou∣rable House, so that in all these respects this Nation remaines, in a very sad and disconsolate condition, and the more, because it is that with us af∣ter so long a Session of so powerfull, and so free a Parliament, and hath been so made and maintained by the abundant love, and liberall effusion of the blood of the people, and therefore knowing no danger nor thraldome, like unto our being left in this so sad a condition by the Parliament, and observing that you are now drawing the great and weighty affaires of this Nation to some conclusion, and fearing that ere long you may be obstru∣cted, by something equally evill to a Negative votes, and that you may be induced to lay by your strength, which under God hath hitherto made you powerfull to all good workes, whilest we have yet time to hope, and you power to helpe, and lest by our silence we might be guilty of that ruine and slavery, which without your speedy help, is like to fall upon us, your selves and the whole Nation, we have presumed to spread our cause thus plainly, and largely before you, and doe most earnestly intreat that you will stir up your affections to a zealous love, and tender regard of the people, who have chosen and trusted you, that you will seriously consider that the end of your trust was freedome, and deliverance from all kind of grievances and op∣pressions.
1 And that therefore in the first place you will be exceeding care∣full to preserve your just Authority from all prejudices of a Negative
 voice in any person or persons whatsoever, which may disable you, from making that happy returne unto the people which they justly ex∣pect, and that you will not be indced to lay by your strength till you have satisfied your understandings in the undoubted security of your selves, and of those who have voluntarily, and faithfully adhered to you in all your extremities, and untill you have secured and setled the Common-wealth in setled peace, and true freedome, which is the end of the primitive institution of all government.
2 Secondly, that you will take off all sentences, fines, and imprison∣ments imposed on Commoners by any whomsoever, without due course of Law, or judgement of their equalls, and to give due reparati∣ons to all those who have been so injuriously dealt withall, and for pre∣venting the like for the time to come, that you will enact all such arbi∣trary proceedings, to be Capitall crimes.
3 Thirdly, that you permit no authority whatsoever to compell any person or persons, to answer to any questions against themselves or neerest relations, except in cases of private interest between party and party in a legall way, and to release such as suffer by imprisonment, or otherwise, for refusing to answer to such interrogatories.
4 Fourthly, that all Statutes, Oathes, and Covenants may be repea∣led so farre as they tend, or may be construed to the molestation and insnaring of religious peaceable and well affected people, for non-conformity or difference of opinion, or practice in religion.
5 Fifthly, that no man for preaching or publishing his opinion in Religion, in a peaceable way, may be punished or persecuted as here∣ticall, by Judges that are not infallible, but may be mistaken as well as other men in their judgements, lest upon pretence of suppressing er∣rors, Sects, or Schismes, the most necessary truths, and sincere professi∣ons thereof may be supprssed, as upon the like pretence it hath been in all ages.
6 Sixthly that you will for the incouragement of industrious peo∣ple, dissolve that oppressive company of Merchant-Adventurers, and the like, and prevent all such others by great penalties for ever.
7 Seventhly, that you will settle a just, speedy, plain, and unbur∣densom way for deciding of Controversies, and suits in Law, and re∣duce all lawes, to the neerest agreement with Christianity, and publish them in the English tongue, and that all processe and proceedings
 therein, may be true, and also in English, and in the most usuall Cha∣racter of writing, without any abreviation, that each one who can read, may the better understand their owne affaires, and that the duties of all Judges, Officers, and practisers in the Law, and of all Magistrates and Officers in the Common-wealth, may be prescribed, their fees li∣mited under strict penalties, and published in Print, to the knowledge and view of all men, by which just and equitable meanes, this Nation shall be for-ever freed of an oppression, more burdensome and trouble∣some then all the oppressions hitherto by this Parliament removed.
8 Eighthly, that the life of no person may be taken away under the testimony of two witnesses at least, of honest conversation, and that in an equitable way you will proportion punishment to offences, so that no mans life be taken away, his body punished, nor his estate forfeited, but upon such weighty and considerable causes, as justly deserve such punishment, and that all prisoners may have a speedy tryall, that they be neither starved, nor their Families ruined by long and lingring im∣prisonment, and that imprisonment may be used only for safe custody untill time of tryall, and not as a punishment for offences.
9 Ninthly, that tythes, and all other inforced maintenances, may be for ever abolished, and nothing in place thereof imposed, but that all Ministers may be payd only by those who voluntarily choose them, and contract with them for their labours.
10 Tenthly, that you will take some speedy and effectuall course, to relieve all such prisoners for debt as are altogether unable to pay, that they may not perish in prison through the hard-heartednesse of their Creditors, and that all such who have any estates, may be inforced to make payment accordingly, and not shelter themselves in prison to de∣fraud their Creditors.
11 Eleventhly, that none may be Prison-keepers, but such as are of approved honesty, and that they be prohibited under great penal∣ties, to receive or detaine any person or persons without lawfull war∣rant, that their usage of Prisoners may be with gentlenesse and civility, their fees moderate and certaine, and that they may give security for the good behaviour of their under officers.
12 Twelfthly, that you will provide some powerfull meanes to keepe men, women, and children from begging and wickednesse,
 that this Nation may be no longer a shame to Christianity therein.
13 Thirteenthly, that you will restraine and discountenance the malice, and impudency of impious persons in their reviling, and re∣proaching the well-affected with the ignominious titles of Round-heads, factious, seditious, and the like, whereby your reall friends have been a longtime, and still are exceedingly wronged, discouraged, and made obnoxious to rude and prophane people, and that you will not exclude any of approved fidelity, from bearing offices of trust in the Common-wealth for Non-conformity, but rather Neuters, and such as manifest disaffection or opposition to common freedome, the ad∣mission and continuation of such, being the chiefe cause of all our grie∣vances. These Remedies, or what other shall seeme more effectuall in your grave wisdomes, we humbly pray may be speedily applied, and that in doing thereof you will be confident of the assistance of your Petitioners, and of all considerate well-minded people, to the utmost of their best abilities against all opposition whatsoever, looking upon our selves, as more concerned now at last to make a good end, then at the first to have made a good beginning, for what shall it profit us, or what remedy can we expect, if now after so great troubles and mise∣ries this Nation should be left by this Parliament, in so great a thral∣dome both of body, mind, and estate; Wee beseech you therefore, that withall your might, whilest you have time, freedome and power, so effectually to fulfill the true ends of Parliaments in delivering this Na∣tion, from these, and all other grievances, that none may presume or dare to introduce the like for ever; And we trust the God of your good successe, will manifest the sincerity of our intentions herein, and that our humble desires are such, as tend not only to our owne particular, but to the generall good of the Common-wealth, and proper for this honourable house to grant, without which this Nation cannot be safe or happy; And that he will blesse you with true Christian fortitude, suitable to the trust and greatnesse of the worke you have undertaken, and make the memory of this Parliament blessed to all succeeding generations.
