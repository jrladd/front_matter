MY LORD,
THE Occasion of the following Tract happening in your Country, your Na∣tive Country, between your Country∣men discoursing of Religion, and particularly the one defending that Religion wherein your Lord∣ship
is most eminently Principl'd; and of your exemplary Piety and Devotion therein, the eyes of your Country have been often witnesses, hath encouraged my presumption to this Dedica∣tion: Nor will your Lordship deem the Patro∣nage of these few Leaves a diminution to your Glory, seeing you have made it the Glory of your Honourable Person and the Admiration and Joy of all Protestant Professors in the Church of England, that amidst and after so many Tryals and Temptations in foreign parts (where you have resided) you should still remain unshaken in your Faith, that no self or private Conveniences, no politick respects to Times or Places could al∣lure you from the publick profession of the Reli∣gion of the Church of England; of that pure Re∣ligion confirmed to be the truest on Earth by the most signal proof under Heaven, even by the crim∣son Stream of the dear blood of Gods Vicegerent, who for the Church suffered many and bitter A∣gonies of Life, as if the Thorns which once sur∣rounded the Temples of our Saviour, had been platted anew on the Brows of this holy Martyr.
We often read of an innocent Lamb without spot offered in Sacrifice, but here a spotless Shep∣herd
more innocent than his Sheep, became an Ob∣lation for his Flock; a Royal Shepherd too, whose Holiness entitled him to an Alliance with the Ma∣jesty of Heaven, and made him truly a God on Earth, and Son of the Most High. It cannot be deny'd, but in his sufferings for the Church, this great Patron of Religion came neer to those of the Eternal Saviour of Mankind, whom the Jews put to Death for planting Religion in the World; and a People, worse than Jews, slaugh∣ter'd this good King for defending the same Re∣ligion & Church which was nailed to the Cross in Mount Calvary; his own people too imitated the Jews in perpetrating the horrid Villany, that here is a Testimony and Reputation to the Protestant Profession transcending all the Testimonies of former Ages, and the greatest that ever Age or Na∣tion could boast of. In all the Romish Kalendar of Canonized Saints, in their whole Roll of pre∣tended Martyrs, where is there one, since the A∣postles time, worthy to have been a Torch bear∣er or born a Flambeaux at his Grave? Had Rome, for their Faith, such a glorious Name to boast of, what Pilgrimages from their utmost Con∣fines, what Processions from all parts of their
Territories would be made to his Shrine? Even Divine Adoration would be given at his Tomb; (and indeed such Devotion would come neerer to true Worship there, than at all the prophane Al∣tars they have before bowed.) And as in the Infant Plantation of Christs Church, the holy Shepherd (the Lord of Life) was smitten, and the Sheep were scatter'd, hid, and concealed for a space; so likewise as if true Religion had not only been de∣posed, but Crucified too with this Martyr on the Scaffold, the true Church was forced to walk in∣visible (as to the knowledg of her Enemies) in this Land, and not to be found but in Cells and silent places; for then were Instructions to right Faith and good Life chain'd up, and temptations to Atheism Irreligion, and Prophaneness let loose upon men: Then holy Guides and Pillars of the Church suf∣fered, some Death, some a barbarous Captivity; Persecution raged on all her Children; then Trea∣son triumphed, Rebellion was rampant, and with Faction and Sedition became the Epidemical Tu∣tors of the times; then nothing was dangerous for men to practise but Loyalty and Vertue, or to profess but the old Protestant Religion: Thence followed the fatal Necessity forevery true Prote∣stant
to be his own Priest, and to fortifie himself by consulting the Divine Oracles and Writings, which the Saints (of old) & Fathers of the Church had left to Posterity, for our strengthning against the Assaults of Schism. And then it was that I ap∣plyed my self to a sedulous examination of those Principles in Religion which Education had in∣still'd, and to search the bottom on which my pro∣fession of Faith was founded; and it was then that I found the best direction for my task and purpose from that most excellent Advice (which I appre∣hended might well serve every Subject as the Son of a King) of that glorified Saint (and holy Mar∣tyr for the same Faith) left to his Son, then Prince of Wales, which is able to rivet the most waver∣ing Spirit on the rock of Assurance Indeed, who can remember his holy Life in that Faith, and his submission to Death for the same, or read his Di∣vine Writings, and be faithless? And who can be so merciless to himself as not to contemplate the former and read the latter for his Confirmation in Religion, in the Religion of his King, the best of Kings, in the Religion proved, by undeniable Au∣thority, to be the best in the world.
The King of Kings preserve his Sacred Majesty
our Soveraign, and the Royal Progeny, and their Posterity, in the perseverance of the same profes∣sion of Religion, to the perpetual honour of their Names and Crowns, the safety and glory of the Church and Kingdoms. And the same Divine Providence bless your Lordship with long and happy days, to be still a Light in your Sphere by your Zeal and Constancy in the Protestant Pro∣fession, to the still Confusion of Face of those ene∣mies of Gods Church, whose malitious Impudence continually asperse the Devotion of great and (cast a suspicion on the Religion of) good men; and as you have fervently imitated our grand Master (of adored and blessed memory) in his transcendent unimitable Constancy in the true Faith, which set him (not as his Enemies machinated, in a Cloud) a Sun in full glory, ever shining after death, so your Lordship (after Life on Earth finished) may be a Star of the next Magnitude with him in the Firmament of Glory, is the fervent Prayer of,
My Lord,
