MADAM,
WEre it in the power of Musick to abate-those strong Impressions of Grief which have continued upon me ever since the Loss of my dear lamented Husband, there are few (I believe) who are furnished with larger or better supplies of Com∣fort from this Science, than he has left me in his own Compositions, and in the Satisfaction I find, that they are not more valued by me (who must own my self fond to a Partiality of all that was his) than by those who are no less Judges than Patrons of his Performances. I find, Madam, I have already said enough to justifie the Presumption of this Application to Your Ladiship, who have added both these Characters to the many ex∣cellent Qualities, which make You the Admiration of all that know You. Your Ladiship's extraordinary skill in Musick, beyond most of either Sex, and Your great Goodness to that dear Person, whom You have some∣times been pleased to honour with the Title of Your Master, makes it hard for me to judge whether he con∣tributed more to the vast Improvements You have made in that Science, or Your Ladiship to the Reputa∣tion he gain'd in the Profession of it: For I have often heard him say, That as several of his best Compositions were originally design'd for Your Ladiship's Entertain∣ment, so the Pains he bestowed in fitting them for Your Ear, were abundantly rewarded by the Satisfaction he has received from Your Approbation, and admirable Performance of them, which has best recommended both them and their Author to all that have had the happiness of hearing them from Your Ladiship.

Thus, Madam, Your Ladiship has every way the justest Title to the Patronage of this Book, the Publi∣cation of which, under the auspicious Influence of Your Name, is the best (I had almost said the only) means I have left of Testifying to the World, my desire to pay the last Honours to its dear Author, Your Lady∣ship having generously prevented my intended Perfor∣mance of the Duty I owe to his Ashes, by erecting a fair Monument over them, and gracing it with an Inscripti∣on which may perpetuate both the Marble and his Me∣mory. Your Generosity, which was too large to be confin'd either to his Life or his Person, has also extend∣ed it self to his Posterity, on whom Your Ladiship has been pleas'd to entail Your Favours, which must, with all Gratitude, be acknowledg'd as the most valua∣ble part of their Inheritance, both by them, and
