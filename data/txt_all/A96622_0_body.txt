SIR,
DEdications are in Our Times so frequent, that it's now accounted ei∣ther Presumption, or Singurity to appear in Print without it: Your Name is here prefixed, not only that Custom necessitates me thereto, but because an Op∣portunity is given me to tell the Present, and Future Ages, how much I Love and Ho∣nour your Piety and Prudence; And how
much I am, my self your Debtor for the Constancy of your Favour, and the many respectful Acknowledgements I have re∣ceived from you, in an Age, when Love waxeth cold, even to neer Relations, who are extreamly undervalued, or held Contemp∣tible, if Inferior to them.
The designe of this present Work is to signifie my Love and Gratitude by the best return which I can make; Which is by an Address of the ensuing Discourse to your Consideration. Had you all the Accom∣plishments this Life is capable of, yet whilst in the World, you cannot be past the need of helps, whatever they may be. This I com∣mit to your judgment, promising it a Cover∣ing large enough for the Deficiency of the Author; And my self a good Acceptance from him, who was pleased to encourage it in the Pulpit, with a Christian Respect and Attention. Sir, This Sermon is your s by many Engagements, and my Prayers, at the Throne of Grace, cease not, that these Di∣rections may be Yours in the practical and
real Enjoyments of them; That the Nature, Marks, and Acts, of a Broken and Con∣trite Heart, may be exemplified in the Con∣versations of you and yours; And that the many publique Exhibitions of Grace and Vertue wherewith you have been eminently Honoured, may by the Finger of Gods Spirit be Engraven on the fleshly Tables of your Hearts: That the Lord have made you in some measure happy herein, I am extreamly confirmed, from the Observation of your Zeal for God, his Church, and the Ministers of his Word; and your Humble, Temperate, and Friendly Deportment towards all: to which I might add, The Blessings enjoyed by your Religious & Beloved Consort, in the Comforts of a Well-Govern'd Family. And now dearest Sir, Because Idespair of oppor∣tunity suitable to mine own Wishes, and your Merit, I have made hold to close with this slender Advantage, of testifying to the World my deep sense I have of your personal Worth, which with your other Obligations, hath me∣rited abundantly more from me to your
praise, than either your Wisdom or Modesty will acknowledge; or for the nearness of my Relation to you, may be held convenient for me to enlarge. That which was Preach'd with you formerly, and now published for the use of all, may be especially useful to you and yours: And that the Father of Mercies will returne all your Kindness with a Rich recom∣pence of Reward both of Grace here, and Glory hereafter, in the World to come, is the unfained desire of,
Sir,

From may Study, the 12th, of Sept. 1670.
