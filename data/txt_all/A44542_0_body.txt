My Lord,
AFter your Lordship had desired me to Print this Sermon, I met with a Discourse upon the very same Subject, and upon an occasion of the same nature, by an abler Hand,Mr. Y. in the year 1685. which made me look upon the printing of mine as need∣less, and had almost prevailed with me to lay aside all thoughts of Publishing what I deliver'd in your Lordship's presence; but considering, that Obedience would be bet∣ter resented than Excuses, and a man had better see himself out-shined by persons of greater parts and abilities, which is a com∣fort to an humble mind, than be guilty of disrespect to those whom we look upon both as our Friends and Superiors (Not to men∣tion

that our matter and method are diffe∣rent) I was resolved to venture; And tho these courser Meditations may not give that satisfaction that more elaborate Orations do, yet since there must be Vnder-workmen, as well as Master-builders, and both may be useful in their several stations, I was willing to appear before your Lordship with this Present, in which I must beseech you to re∣gard the heart with which it is offer'd, more than the gift it self; which if you do, you will not only let the World see, how great your Charity is in over-looking De∣fects and Blemishes, but increase the Ob∣ligations you have already laid on,
My Lord,
