SWeetenesse and Beauty, two chiefe Quaâˆ£lities
Of Gardens, shine forth in such radiant
wise
In you sweete Mrs Douse, faire Margaret
Prime Flowers of the House of Carteret,
That 'twere Ingratitude, nay Injury
For me in silence here to passe You by,
And not inscribe this PARADISE to You,
To whom it is in all respects most Due.
Deigne then to owne this little Testimonie
Of Thankes, for all your Love and Courtesie
To me an Exil'd Prisner, in Jersy,
Who shall endeavour to be till I dye,
