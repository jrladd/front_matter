SIR,
IAm embol∣dened by the singular Ver∣tues and o∣ther worthy Endow∣ments I have been an Admirer of in You, to make choice of Your∣self to be the Patron of the following Discourse.

And the Law of Grati∣tude commands me like∣wise, to take this occasi∣sion of making a thank∣ful Acknowledgment of the many Favours, which, as unworthy as I have been of them, I have received from you.
As to this Treatise and its Authour, Silence best becomes me in regard of the near Re∣lation I bear to him.

Onely this I would sug∣gest, That since he had not prepared it for the Press, that Accuracy and Exactness ought not to be lookt for in it, which otherwise might be expected: But I doubt not, 'twill have the Approbation of all good men, as a Dis∣course well adapted to the Promoting and Fur∣therance of true Piety.

And that it may be suc∣cessful to this best of Ends, is the Hearty Prayer of,
SIR,
