SIR,
YOu being so much concern'd in the subsequent Catalogue of those Baronets, who were invested with that Dignity and Title by the Royal Munifi∣cence of our late Monarchs, I did believe that there was an Obligation incumbent upon me to offer up this Register to your Patronage; and that inforc'd from these two Reasons.
First, The Antiquity and Noblenesse of your Ex∣traction did invite it.
Secondly, You being the premier Baronet that leads up the Van of those worthy persons that have been for∣merly dignified with that honorary Title, did appeare almost to exact this Dedication, which I hope will by you be as benignly received, as it is really consecrated to your Name,
By
Sir,
