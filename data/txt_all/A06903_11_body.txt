I Haue not found any particular sporte or masterie whatsoeuer, of more antiquitie or honorable estimation, then the vse of running horses; so that if in our actions we are to take imitation from the Aunti∣ents, then without question there is no man able to stand vp against this pleasure, being both most old, and moste royallie defended by the authoritie of many Emperors. But least my supposition, should draw on a question vn∣created, I will forbeare to defende what none will im∣pugne, and onely say, if I haue to the Art giuen as good rules as all men will giue allowance to the sporte, there is no doubt but I shall reape thankes in greate measure. Wel what I haue done, let experience iudge, and where I haue made any escape after a due tryall let mee receiue the rigor of a humaine charitie; so though I smart, yet I shal not be confounded, but liue either to recant or make satisfaction. Farwell.
