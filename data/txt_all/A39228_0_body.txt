Gentlemen,
AS I have sometime said unto you, so I now write, That there be none on Earth that have so great and eminent a Calling from man to take care of the Indians, that they be instructed in the wayes of life by Christ Iesus, as your selves have. For, besides the Right Honourable Corporation in London, His Majesty our Soveraign hath ordered a Trust to be committed to such as shall be in your Order, namely, Commissioners of the United Co∣lonies in New-England, to take care of this matter. I finde few English Students willing to engage in∣to so dim a Work as this is. God hath in mercy raised up sundry among themselves to a competent ability to teach their Countrymen. Many have been sent forth by the Church this Winter to divers places, and not without good success, through the grace of Christ: of which I shall (if God will, and that I live) give you an account at your next

Sitting. I finde it necessary for me to instruct them (as in Principles of Art, so) in the way of communicating the good knowledge of God, which I conceive is most familiarly done by way of Dia∣logues; an Essay whereunto I do here present unto you: purposing, if the Lord will, and that I live, to do more of the like kinde hereafter. My earnest Request unto your selves, is, That in all your re∣spective Colonies you would take care that due Ac∣commodation of Lands and Waters may be allowed them, whereon Townships and Churches may be (in after-Ages) able to subsist; and suffer not the English to strip them of all their Lands, in places fit for the Sustenance of the life of man. Thus commending you to the Lord, I rest,
