SIR, this vnfortunate child, who
in eight daies (as lately I haue
learned) was begot and borne
soone after, was by his parents
(perhaps because hee was so vn∣like
his brethren) exposed to the
wide world, who for want of
iudgement, or not vnderstanding
the priuy marke of Ironie about
it (which shewed it was no of-spring of any vulgar
braine) vtterly reiected it: so that for want of accep∣tance
it was euen ready to giue vp the Ghost, and was in
danger to haue bene smothered in perpetuall obliuion, if
you (out of your direct antipathy to ingratitude) had not
bene moued both to relieue and cherish it: wherein I must
needs commend both your iudgement, vnderstan∣ding,
and singular loue to good wits; you afterwards sent
it to mee, yet being an infant and somewhat ragged, I
haue fostred it priuately in my bosome these two yeares,

and now to shew, my loue returne it to you, clad in good
lasting cloaths, which scarce memory will weare out, and
able to speake for it selfe; and withall, as it telleth mee,
desirous to try his fortune in the world, where if yet it be
welcome, both father and foster-father, nurse and child,
haue their desired end. If it bee slighted or traduced, it
hopes his father will beget him a yonger brother, who
shall reuenge his quarrell, and challenge the world ei∣ther
of fond and meerely literall interpretation, or illite∣rate
misprision. Perhaps it will be thought to bee of the
race of Don Quixote: we both may confidently sweare,
it is his elder aboue a yeare; and therefore may (by ver∣tue
of his birth-right) challenge the wall of him. I doubt
not but they will meet in their aduentures, and I hope the
breaking of one staffe will make them friends; and per∣haps
they will conbine themselues, and trauell through
the world to seeke their aduentures. So I commit him to
his good fortune, and my selfe to your loue.
