THE Author of this Treatise, having some Years since Publish∣ed a large Volumn of Chyromancy and Metaposcopy, a Work very acceptable with the Learned; hath now thought it convenient after some years Study, and further Labour in this Science, to Pub∣lish in a Pocket Volumne, his more Secret Experiences, and
Private Animadversions, in a narrow compasse, to comprise (in a manner) the whole Art of Palmistry, producing New and Experienced Aphorismes, not formerly published, the better to facillitate those, who are de∣sirous to spend time in these so pleasing Studies; In a Word, He hath vindicated the Art from Superstition, and judici∣ously by the portracture of a few hands discovered Chyro∣mancy, in it's intire, natural and Pristine verity, more faithfully and more easy to be apprehend∣ed, then either Taisner, or any other Author.
As for his Book of Elections, he hath therein followed the Tract of the Antients, clearing many doubts and Ambiguities in their Writings, making all things more plain and easy, then they did, for which the Ingeni∣ous,
are obliged unto him, and will doubtlesse own his indu∣stry for such his discovery, and explaining those Knotty pieces he met with in their Labours.
I do Heartily approve of both his Labours, and as the mean∣est in the Number of Astrolo∣gers, give him my Suffrage, and thanks for his paines, and am his Assured Friend
