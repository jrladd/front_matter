Dear Sister,
HOwever it was my great mis∣fortune, by those who had a power to command me, and did, to be taken from you, and from Two Parishes upon the matter, wherein I am confident I wanted not the love of any, and I think none will complain either of my want of care or love to them, yet I have ever since my forced de∣parture from you, had you in my thoughts, and a desire to leave some Memorial amongst you,
 whereby you may bear me in your memories, when I am dead, and gone out of this World, which is so bad, that I want an Epithite to speak what it is; I know you were always lovers of the Common-Prayer-Book, and if you loved me because I loved it too, ye are the worthier to participate of some of these my poor endeavours up∣on it; To you I present them first, and chiefly, and if they meet with your acceptance, I question not but they will be accepted by ma∣ny others of the Gentry about you, to whom You may, if you please to command me, present them by Your own fair Hand, with my Prayers to God for You, and all Yous,
