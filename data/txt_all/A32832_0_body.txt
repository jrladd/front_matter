My LORD,
IT was a Transport of exceeding Joy, and com∣fortable Omen of our future Happiness, (af∣ter that afflictive Sadness which fill'd all Loyal Hearts, upon the surprizing News of the Death of our most Gracious Sovereign of Bl. Memo∣ry) to see and observe with what unanimous and chearful Acclamations, and bravery of Resoluti∣on, Your Honour, and others of the Nobili∣ty, Gentry, and Clergy of this County, with the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Lei∣cester, attended the High-Sheriff in Proclaim∣ing the Succession of the High and Mighty King JAMES the Second, as the Undoubted and only Lineal Heir of the Imperial Crown.
And, so soon as I had retired from that pub∣lick Solemnity, my Thoughts resolved themselves into These ensuing Meditations, which I here make bold to present Your Lordship with; by that means to recommend them farther to a more common acceptance and benefit: As containing in them a seasonable Mite or Two of that Religious Loyalty which the Church of Eng∣land traineth up all her Members to, and is in a peculiar manner agreeable to Your Ho∣nour's constant Sentiments and Inclinations: In hopes, that Your Lordship will not only pardon the presumption, but admit of this small Present for an additional Testimony of the most humble Duty of,
My LORD,
