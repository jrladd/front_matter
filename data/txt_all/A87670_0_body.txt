May it please your Majesty,
WHen the King of Kings had fasted forty dayes and forty nights,
hee was afterward an hungered: (although as∣sisted by the deitie) and
then for any within knowledge of it to neglect admi∣nistring to him a
morsell had really con∣cluded them guilty of the highest ingra∣titude and
inhumanity. Man lives not by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth ofGod▪ Which your long abstinence from,
in relation to publique administration; hath put mee upon this bold attempt,
in tender compassion to your better part; as to present you with a branch
the fruit whereof will, if savoured sensibly, pro∣cure an appetite, to
those delicates, which by more excellent hands are ready at your call to be
served in unto you: which de∣gree of recovery will disrobe thousands of
Gods people, and your faithfull Sub∣jects of their sad and sable thoughts,
and serve up their hearts to the highest de∣gree of prayse that hath, in
relation to his glory, and your good, so far heard their prayers.
Thus, thus Sir, if your Majesty please to forsake
your nets that intangle you; deny your selfe, and your self-rea∣soning
audience that assault You, andfollow Jesus Christ in his
ordinances the Prince of peace, whose name is Coun∣cellor to
advise you. You may yet create all good men your cordiall friends; and admit
none to repine at your returne, but the Gospells and Religions enimies.
Great Sir, If this plainnesse bee an error it is my
affection to your Majesties soule makes mee to erre, and the pros∣perity
of one fault, hath made mee con∣fident to commit a second; for I professe
I long after it, and make it one part of my designe, at the throne of grace,
that God would so sanctifie all your experien∣ces for the time past; that
you may be a gratious Instrument for the advancing of his glorious will for
the time to come: And now the Lord grant you usefull pro∣fit, in perusing
my poore indeavours so as shall best sort both for the
accomplish∣mentof your owne eternall good, and the Kingdomes
just desires, yea the Lord grant that as this sermon received grace from
you in hearing it with reverent attention; so it may increase grace in you
by your serious intention. And the Lord of peace peaceably salute you by
it: and grace you with all spirituall blessings till he bring you to injoy
his, and your peoples firme love; your Parliaments councell; and Heavens Glory:
which is and shall be the daily prayer of
