KIng Solomon began to build his tem∣ple in the moneth April or Zif,Vatablus, and the Chaldee Paraphrase. when flowres open; and finished it in the moneth Bul, when hearbes beginne to close vp and wither, answerable to our December: This Sermon was preached among you in the beginning of Winter, and since hath been shut vp yet now vpon the importunity of some friends commeth to life againe, with the beginning of the Spring, My warning for it was short, and being then in the Country with you to ten∣der my labours among you according to my promise, vp∣pon your free grant of a worthy fauour vnto mee; I was constrained to vse onely the helpe of my deare and Reue∣rend Fathers Library: Your former acceptance of my
paines assure me, that I shall not be misconstrued in this labour, which I vndertooke out of that loue I owe vnto you all and yours. Many things in themselues of no mo∣ment,Plinie. haue beene highly prized, because they haue beene dedicated to Temples. This sudden Sermon I hope shal finde acceptance, because it was dedicated at the Con∣secration of your little Temple. Your Schoole foun∣ded by gracious King Edward, a Prince of blessed memo∣rie; and confirmed by Q. Elizabeth, a Princesse wor∣thy neuer to be forgotten, for loue to the Gospel, still flou∣risheth, and long may it: yet neuer was consecrated till now. Continue your care of it: your loue to the church, and respect of those who are instruments to instruct you in the way to Heauen; So shall you continue those many blessings, which already you enioy; and multiplie them for your posterity, which I shall pray for; and en∣deauour by all Christian respects, which I may performe vnto you.
From my Study in London: April. 5. 1617.
