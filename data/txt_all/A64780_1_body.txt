Sir
IF like a Pythonist I from my Witts
May chance to start, vent Oracles by fitts,
And so be Poet dub'd, know I am one
Not born but made by inspiration,
For from Your influence my Muse begun,
My lines the Paralelies of Your Sun.
And since from the Pindarique Mountain You
Descend, to lend Your hand to us below:
Loe our Inferiour Orbs begin to move,
And act by the Intelligence of Your Love,
And though you can't expect from Pigmey braines
Witt's Garagantuas, Gigantique strains,
How 'ere my Muse (though stretch'd upon the Last
Of an Hyperbole,'s but a Neurospast
Mou'd by Your Candours Mysterious wire)
Inspired, though not with a Delphique fire,
But a pure Vestall flame, contends to raise
Her note, unto the Elah of Your praise,
If you accept these tender spriggs, know she.
Will give You better at Maturity.
