POndering with my selfe (beloued) to whome I should dedicate this labour, I found none that had greater right or claime to it then your selues: at the re∣quest of some of you it first began to be, & came to be sounded viva voce in the eares of you and many other. At the earnest request of the some it now commeth forth to a further view, which I thought should neuer haue seene the Sunne any more. Further, the matter of it in some part concer∣neth you onely, and was perticularly dressed and serued for your instruction; though there be many dishes com∣mon to you and others to feed vpon, for these respects me thinks I should wrong you, if I should dedicate it to a∣ny other: My desire in penning it, is the same it was in preaching it, that you may be edified and taught to liue soberly, righteously, and holily, in this present world, &

I haue peace of conscience both in the one and the other: I affected plainenes in speaking, so I haue in writing, and therein kept my selfe as neare as I can, with the helpe of my briefe notes, to the method phrase and matter, I obser∣ued in the deliuery of it. Accept it according to the worth of the matter, looke vpon that, not vpon my rude∣nes in handling it: the meat is good, though happily an other Cooke might haue dressed and serued it in more skilfully. Thus I leaue it to your charitable and christian acceptation; and you all, to the blessing of him who is blessed for euer: To whome I will pray (that as in pub∣lishing this labour, I haue satisfied some of you) you all may according to the desires of my heart, receaue pro∣fit and instruction by it.
