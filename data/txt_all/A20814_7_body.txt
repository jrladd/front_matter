SIR, this Poeme of mine, which I imparted to you, at my beeing with you at your lodging at London in May last, brought at length to perfection, (emboldened by your wonted fauours) I aduenture to make you Patron of. Thus Sir you see I haue aduentred to the worlde, with what like or dislike, I know nor, if it please (which I much doubt of) I pray you then be pertaker, of that which I shall esteeme not my least good: if dislike, it shall lessen some part of my griefe, if it please you to alow but of my loue: howsoe∣uer, I pray you accept it as kindly as I offer it, which though without many , yet (I assure you) with much desire of your honour. Thus vntill such time as I may in some more larger measure make knowne my loue to the hap∣py & generous family of the Gooderes, (to which I confesse my selfe to be beholding to, for the most part of my educati∣on) I wish you all happines.
