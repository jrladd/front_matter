My Lords,
YOUR Lordships having been plea∣sed to appoint me One of the Physicians of the Fleet, I thought my self obliged, to use my utmost endeavours for discharging the

Trust you committed to me: and therefore I, not only, kept a Journal of the Mens Names, and a History of their Sickness; but of the Medicins I gave them, with the Success they had. And when I had considered the way of their living, and other circum∣stances, there appeared to me a very reasona∣ble View of the Dis∣eases at Sea, which I first committed to Pa∣per

for my own As∣sistance in the Service; but am now perswa∣ded to submit those Thoughts to the Cen∣sure of the World. Yet, in This I shall run no great Risque, under your Lordships Pro∣tection, which, I hope, you will not deny me; since 'tis your Lord∣ships gave Them, first, Life, and They have grown up under your Favour to what They are: so that if They

obtain the End, I de∣sign'd Them for, the publick Good; 'Tis the Publick must thank you for Them. I am, with great Re∣spect,
My Lords,
