GREAT SIR,
HAving, under the Happy Influence of Your Ma∣jesty's Gracious Government, had the leisure to write the History of the Life of One of the most Glorious of Your Royal Predeces∣sors, King EDWARD the Third, to whom should I dedicate the same, but to Your Majesty; who are the Inheritor of those Realms which He governed; the Soveraign of that most Noble ORDER which he Founded; and the lively Resem∣blance of all those Vertues which He so eminently possessed. Whose Immense Goodness to all Your Subjects in general, whose Heroick
Inclinations to Military Honour, and whose Princely Love and Respect to Learning, do render You as Gracious at Home, and as Terrible abroad, as King EDWARD was in his Days.
It is Your Majesty's Delight and Glory Graciously to accept of the well-intended Endeavours of the meanest of Your Subjects, par∣ticularly of those, which are employed in Recollecting the Glori∣ous Memoires of Your Renowned Ancestors, Monarchs of this Isle. And no doubt succeeding Generations will rise up to the Memory of that Prince, by whose Favour and Liberality the Remembrance of former Ages hath been brought to Light.
Wherefore heartily wishing unto Your Sacred Majesty a Fruit∣full Consort, a Flourishing Family, a Long Life, a Quiet and Secure Government, Victorious Armies, Obedient Subjects, and Wise and Loyal Parliaments, besides Eternal Felicities, I humbly Dedicate this Work to Your Great Name, as being
GREAT SIR,
