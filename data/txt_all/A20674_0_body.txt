SIR,
I Haue done that here,
which intruth I never
thought to haue done;
Namely put my selfe
vpon the publique cen∣sure
for a Sermon: For I
knowe, and well consider
the superabundancy of this kinde of writing,
wherewith the world may seeme not more instru∣cted,

then opprest. But the maine reason that
draue me on this determination, was a fitnesse here
of the argument with the times; in which case a∣lone
(to speake my minde) I haue ever thought such
discourses, at leastwise excusable, if divulged;
Especially when as too the argument thus taken in
hand happens a little besides the vsuall roade: not
trauers'd and debated in every treatise. Vpon this
ground, or howsoever I was perswaded, hauing
perchance resolu'd of a publication. I knewe not to
whom I could more iustly entitle this Schedule,
then to your selfe. First for the particular respect
I owe you, and then by reason of my collegiate du∣ty
in which I stand bound. Please you then Sir,
but to accept of these my first fruits: It may bee
hereafter I shall bee able to vndertake some one
thing or other, which may better deserue your
name and patronage. Meane while I remaine,
as ever,
