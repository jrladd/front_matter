My Lord,
I Must neither question your Lordship's judg∣ment, nor dispute your commands; and that's the onely apology I can make for pub∣lishing this Discourse: but how far it may

avail me, depends purely upon the good na∣ture of my Readers, who may, I confess, ea∣sily return that blame upon my self, which I here endeavour to transfer upon your Lord∣ship. For the pretended Modesty of Good Writers has so anticipated all pleas which can be offer'd by the Bad, to palliate their im∣perfections, that we have not so much as a Fig-leaf left to cover our real shame, but what they, by unnecessary and frequent using, have render'd transparent and ineffectual. And therefore this Sermon, rude and mis∣shapen as it is, had been sent out naked into the World, without any other Covert but your Lordship's Order, did not the respect I bear to your Court oblige me, in this Dedi∣cation, to beg your pardon for the slight∣ness of the performance, instead of making an insignificant excuse for the publication of it. I confess my Presumption in giving so plain, though hearty an entertainment, to so

solemn and judicious an Assembly, was a fault, which I hope my obedience now may partly expiate; whereby I have given a publick te∣stimony, how intirely I submit my own judg∣ment and reputation too to your Lordship's commands, and have, though with regret, made this dangerous essay to shew my self,
My Lord,
