Right Worshipfull,
THe cheife Magistrats next vnto the Lord Maior▪ are the two sheriffes, the name Sherife implyeth as much as the Reeue and Gouernour of a Sheare, for Ree: is Graue Count or Earle (for so saith Master Verstigan:) and these, were of like autho∣rity with the Censors, who were reputed in the prime and best ranke amongst the Magistrates of Rome? They were so cal'd a Cessendo, of ceasing, for they set a rate vpon euery mans estate: registring their names, and placing them in a fit century: A second part of their Office consisted in the refor∣ming of maners, as hauing power to inquire into euery mans life and carriage. The Embleame of which Authority was their Tirgula▪ censoria borne before them: they are (by others) resembled to the Tribunes of the people, and these are cal'd Sacro Sancti, whose persons might not be , nor their names any way scandaliz'd▪ for whosoever was proued to be a de∣linquent in either, was held to be Homo sacer▪ an excommu∣nicated person, and hee that slew him was not liable vnto any iudgement: their Houses stand open continually, not onely for Hospitality, but for a Sanctuary to all such as were distst: neither was it lawfull for them to be absent from the Colledge one whole day together, during their Yeare. Thus you see

how neere the Dignities of this Citty, come neere to these in Rome, when it was most slourishing. The first Sheriffes that bore the name and office in this Citty, were Peter Duke, and Thomas Neale, Anno 1209. The nouissimi, now in present Samuell Cranmer and Henry Pratt. Anno 1631. To whom I direct this short Remembrance.
Your Worships euer Attendant,
Thomas Heywood.
