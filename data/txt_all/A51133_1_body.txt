THE Respect which I have ever had for you
since our first Acquaintance, and which on all
Occasions I have expressed in private, I have
now an Opportunity of declaring to the Publick: And
that too so very apposite, that it would be unpardonable
in me to omit it at this time; by presenting the follow∣ing
Sheets to you, Dedicating them to your Name, and
Devoting them and their Author to your Vse and Ser∣vice.
You may well remember the frequent Discourses we
have had on several Subjects treated of in the following
Chapters, and on account whereof I first set on this
Dioptrical Work: And particularly, I think, our Dis∣quisitions

concerning the Iustness of Telescopick Sights
adapted to Astronomical Instruments, and our Conside∣rations
of the Micrometer, were the first Occasion of my
Thoughts turning this Way; And therefore the
ensuing Discourses belong to you of Right. But
if to this I add, the Advantage I have received
by your Acquaintance, and the repeated Satisfaction
I have had in your agreable Conversation; I am
bound by indispensible Tyes to make this Acknow∣ledgment.
I cannot but admire your prudent Choice of a
private, retired Life; notwithstanding your great
Advantages both of Nature and Fortune, that
render you capable of the most publick and weighty
Imploy. By this Course, you have an Opportunity
of enjoying your self, and improving your Philoso∣phical
Thoughts beyond the common pitch: You can
look on unconcern'd, and securely observe the froathy
Sea of Business, wherein Men fluctuate; and some
are shipwreckt, sink, and perish.
And because you seem careless of propagating
your Name the common ways; suffer me to erect
this slight Monument to it: Though I am certain
at the same time, that, if you pleased, you may
raise a lasting Mausolaeum to your Memory;
but you seem above these Desires; yet you'll per∣mit

your Friend to Honour it as far as he can;
and if the Materials or Workmanship do not seem
to promise a long Duration to Posterity, this only
reflects on my Abilities, (which I shall never
vindicate) but cannot lessen the sincere Intention
of
