May it please Your Grace.
VVHen dejected Spirits lye groaning under the heavy pressure of Affliction, they address their Vows unto a Su∣preme Being; likewise in every small Reverse of Fortune, Self-pre∣servation has instructed man to flye unto those Powers on Earth, as are endowed by the Celestial Influences with requisite Qualities for the pro∣tection of the afflicted.
Your Grace having been ordain∣ed and fitted by Heaven for that Employ on Earth, in so vast a mea∣sure as has spread your Fame over the whole Universe; it is no won∣der, Madam, If Camille ha been diligent in attaining to such a pro∣portion of the English Idiom, as

would fit him to appear in your Princely Presence, with more Re∣verence, and to shroud himself with greater Respect, under the Wings of Your Graces generous Protection.
This Roman Gentleman, Ma∣dam, though concealed under the formal Weeds of a Modern Knight-Errants seeming Sanctity, is a Li∣bertine by Profession, and of the very first rank in Licentiousness, who approaches full of confidence, that the bare reflection of Your Graces Perfections is more than sufficient to work a thorough refor¦mation in him.
The whole World is of Opinion that it is with the greatest force of reason imaginable, that this gallant Pilgrim builds on this bottom. For what greater motives to Virtue can there be derived from Humane Na∣ture, Madam, than that exampla∣ry life which Your Grace does steer with such exactness through the

tempestuous Seas of this World, without touching on the two dan∣gerous Rocks of Superstition, or of Religious Contempt.
Here, Madam, I should attempt to numerate Your Graces Virtues, If I would have this Dedication a-la-mode, but besides that I know they are not to be comprehended within the inconsiderate limits of an Epistle; I cannot be guilty of such an Errour, Madam, so long as I know with what disgust Your Grace receives vulgar Applause while with Justice you expect your Reward from above, where Angels only celebrate your Praises, and write your Fame on the vast Tables of Eternity. I shall rest contented in giving Your Grace an hours Di∣vertisement in the lively portrait of a Spanish-Jacobin Fryar, and Father Confessor, of a considerable stand∣ing; persons whose Principal Em∣ployes are so worldly, that their Religious Habit and Profession, are

but the specious pretences, under which those Ghostly Fathers, with singular industry, and admirable Ex∣perience do exercise a most gainful Traffick in Humane Flesh.
If I am ever so happy, Madam, as to have given Your Grace some moments of Recreation, I have my ends. In those hopes I take the bold∣ness to subscribe my self,
