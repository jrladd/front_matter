MADAME, ACCORDING to your request I haue pru∣sed your studious labour of trāslatiō profitably imploied in a right cōmendable work. Whereof for that it liked you to make me a Iudge, and for that the thinge it selfe hath singularly pleased my iudgement, and de∣lighted my mind in reading it, I haue right heartely to thanke your Ladiship, both for youre owne well thinking of me, and for the comforte that it hathe wrought me. But far aboue these priuate respectes, I am by grea∣ter causes enforced, not onely to shewe my reioyse of this your doinge, but also to testi∣fy the same by this my writing prefixed be∣fore the work, to the commoditie of others, and good incouragement of your selfe. You haue vsed your accustomed modestie in sub∣mittinge it to iudgement, but therin is your

prayse doubled, sith it hath passed iudgemēt without reproche. And whereas bothe the chiefe author of the Latine worke and I, se∣uerallye perusinge and conferringe youre whole translation, haue without alteration allowed of it, I must bothe desire youre La∣diship, and aduertise the readers, to thinke that wee haue not therein giuen any thinge to any dissemblinge affection towards you, as beinge contented to winke at faultes to please you, or to make you without cause to please your selfe: for there be sundry respe∣ctes to drawe vs from so doinge, althoughe we were so euil minded, as there is no cause why we should be so thought of. Your own iudgement in discerning flatterie, your mo∣destie in mislikinge it, the layenge open of oure opinion to the world, the truth of our friendship towardes you, the vnwillingnesse of vs bothe (in respecte of our vocations) to haue this publike worke not truely and wel translated, are good causes to perswade, that our allowance is of sincere truth and vnder∣standing: By which your trauail (Madame) you haue expressed an acceptable dutye to the glorye of GOD, deserued well of this

Churche of Christe, honourablie defended the good fame and estimation of your owne natiue tongue, shewing it so able to contend with a worke originally written in the most praised speache: and besides the honour ye haue done to the kinde of women and to the degree of Ladies, ye haue done pleasure to the Author of the Latine boke, in deliue∣ringe him by your cleare translation from the perrils of ambiguous and doubtful con∣structions: and in makinge his good woorke more publikely beneficiall: wherby ye haue raysed vp great comforte to your friendes, and haue furnished your owne conscience ioyfully with the fruit of your labour, in so occupienge your time: whiche must needes redounde to the encoragemente of noble youth in their good educatiō, and to spend their time and knowledge in godly exercise, hauinge deliuered them by you so singular a president. Whiche youre doinge good Madame, as God (I am sure) doth accept and will blesse with increase, so youre and ours moste vertuous and learned soueraigne La∣die and Mastres shal see good cause to com∣mende: and all noble gentlewomen shall

(I trust) hereby be alured from vain delights to doinges of more perfect glory. And I for my part (as occasion may serue) shal exhort other to take profit by your worke, and fol∣lowe your example: whose successe I beseche our heauenly father to blesse and prospere. And now to thende bothe to acknowledge my good approbatiō, and to spread the be∣nefit more largely, where you Ladishippe hathe sent me your boke writen, I haue with most hearty thankes returned it to you (as you see) printed: knowing that I haue ther∣in done the beste, and in this poynte vsed a reasonable pollicye: that is, to preuent suche excuses as your modestic woulde haue made in staye of publishinge it. And thus at this time I leaue furder to trouble youre good Ladishippe.
