YOVR rarest vertues, (honourable Mistres LVCIE,) haue made me, a∣mongst many other competent Iudges of your worth, both to loue and admire you: but the exceeding kinde affection (which I knowe) the House of POWLES-WORTH doe beare you, (a Family where-vnto I must confesse, I am both in loue and dutie more deuote then to any o∣ther) hath mooued mee, for a more parti∣culer proofe of that honor which both they and I are willing to doe you, to dedicate my Poeme to your protection.
Vouchsafe therefore noble Mistres LVCIE, your selfe beeing in full measure, adorned with the like excellent gifts, both of bodie and minde: graciously to patronize MATILDA. A mirror of so rare chastitie, as neither the fayre speeches, nor rich rewards of a King, nor death in selfe, could euer remoue from her owne chast thoughts: or from that due regard which shee had of her neuer-stained honor. Your gra∣cious and curteous acceptance of these my labours, may encourage mee heereafter, to publish some worke of greater worth, vnder your Name and protection, to whom I wish all happinesse.
