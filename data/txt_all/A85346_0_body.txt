Sir,
WERE Presents of this Nature, what they pretend to; and did not rather Engage, then Grati∣fie the Receivers; intitling Them to what Errors soever shall be there com∣mitted: yet notwithstanding could not This of Mine expect to find any such Entertainment, at Your hands. For, I bring not here a Gift; but, pay a Debt; and, but Restore unto you, what was your Owne before: Since this Dedica∣tion is but an Account of some of those houres, which ought wholly to have been Otherwise employed, in your Service.
Neither have you a Single Title to it
only, as Comming from Me: But, so Great is your Affection to Learning; and so Active, in Incouraging all, that make the least Pretence to It; as that, were I a Stranger to you, I should ac∣count my self Obliged to make my Ad∣dresses to You; and should thinke, all my Endeavors were justly due to Him, that deserves so Well of Learning in Ge∣nerall. Be pleased therefore, Sr., to ac∣cept of this Meane Present, as a Testi∣monie, not so much of my Gratitude, as of your own Merit from Learning: & suffer me to make my Hearty, though Weake Attempts of Deserving, in some smal measure, those many Favours, wherewith You have not ceased to Ob∣lige
