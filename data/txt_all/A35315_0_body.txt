SIR,
IT pleased a Noble friend to say of the Lord du Praissac's Discourses (by mee lately Englished) as Aristotle said of his owne writings, Se scripsisse & non scripsisse. For that he con∣ceived a man must be a good Souldier, be∣fore he shall be able well to understand him; he is so full and compendious: And therfore wished that as our Geographers first shew the whole world in one sheet of paper, but then give large descriptions and particular Maps of every Province, so there might be a Comment upon some
Chapters to make them intelligible, and profitable to all.
Of the first Chapter (the Exercise of Armes and Military Motions, &c.) many bookes are obvious; and therefore I have thought fittest to begin at the second, which is of Castrametation or Encamping; wherein I have desired to be the more large, because our Nation is not beholden to any (to my knowledge) that hath laboured therein; and the deputy Lieutenants of this Coun∣ty, finde a want of men fit to be Quarter-masters. I have desired your Patronage, both in respect of my many obligations; as also for that I know you able to correct what is amisse, and courteous to pardon it. And as this small Essay shall find ac∣ceptance, I shall direct my selfe (as leisure and my poore stocke of knowledge shall serve) in the undertaking of the whole worke. Meane time I kisse your hands, and rest
