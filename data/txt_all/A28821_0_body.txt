Madam,
I Do here present to your Ladyship a lively and true Portraiture of your deceased Lady Mother, or rather your own genuine Picture: Though it wants those lively Colours which might be required to set forth it's luster. However, it being drawn after her Death (and so not to the Life) I doubt not but your Ladyship will admit it into your

favourable acceptance, and draw it over again (as you have begun) by your great charity to the poor & piety towards God, in your Christian Life and Conversation.
Your Ladyships Patronage of this work I cannot in prudence beg; for there is no fence against contradicting envy, and malice, which is far from those Noble Persons, and others in this place, where the Illustrious Dutchess breath d, and expired.
Yet I presume to say, that some, who shall peruse the ensuing Treatise, will imagine, if not say, (when they have view∣ed her matchless deeds recorded in the same) that, what they have Read is in∣credible; which censure they will disown, after they have considered, that She was a Miracle of Grace, and a glorious Pro∣digy of Munificence.
Let such persons, misguided in their

Judgments, and misled in their decei∣ving Phansies, know that to commend the dead for their unquestionable merits is a work of that spotless Innocence, that the Authour cannot be attach'd of Flattery in doing it, as the Person commended is out of danger of being injur'd by it, in that she cannot be elevated in her mind, nor tempted to Pride, so said the Learned Maximus Taurinensis in one of his Homilies.
I shall close these few impolite Dedi∣catory lines with my Prayers to the Al∣mighty Lord the God of Grace, that he would be pleased to encrease his Graces (which are great and many) in you, and continue his Mercies to you; that, having with a large Revenue a larger heart, and an open hand, you may tread in the same path of charitable beneficence, in which your Deceased Renowned Mother

walked, and with Her be hereafter glo∣rified in Heaven wearing the Crown of Charity, and Perseverance. This is the hearty Vote of him, who is
Madam,
