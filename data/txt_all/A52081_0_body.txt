THIS Treatise giving an Account of the Certain Signs of the Times, and the near approach of the coming of the Lord, is humbly present∣ed, That they may know what God is going about to do, so as to prepare for the coming of Christ. 'Tis therefore most humbly hoped our most Gracious King, with the Great Council of the Nation, who have so wonderfully appeared for the Defence of the Protestant Religion, may be further instrumental to the Glo∣ry of God, in encouraging the know∣ledge of the Truths hereto contained. God make His Majesty and Great Council to be a Blessing to the Nations.
