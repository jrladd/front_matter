Madam,
AFTER having a great while wisht to write
something that might be worthy to lay
at your Highnesses Feet, and finding it
impossible: Since the World has been so kind to
me to Judge of this Poem to my advantage, as the
most pardonable fault which I have made in its
kind; I had sinn'd against my self, if I had not
chosen this Opportunity to implore (what my Am∣bition
is most fond of) your Favour and Pro∣tection.
For though Fortune would not so far
bless my endeavours, as to encourage them with
your Royal Highnesses presence, when this came
into the World: Yet, I cannot but declare it
was my design and hopes it might have been
your Divertisement in that happy season, when
you return'd again to chear all those eyes that had
before wept for your Departure, and enliven all
hearts that had droopt for your Absence: When

Wit ought to have pay'd it's Choicest Tributes in,
and Joy have known no Limits, then I hop'd my
little Mite would not have been rejected; though
my ill Fortune was too hard for me, and I lost a
greater Honour, by your Royal Highnesses Ab∣sence,
than all the Applauses of the World besides
can make me Reparation for.
Nevertheless, I thought my self not quite un∣happy,
so long as I had hopes this way yet to
recompence my disappointment past: When I
consider'd also that Poetry might claim right to a
little share in your Favour: For Tasso, and Ari∣osto,
some of the best, have made their Names E∣ternal,
by transmitting to after-Ages the Glory of
your Ancestors: And under the spreading of that
shade, where two of the best have plant∣ed
their Lawrels, how Honoured should I
be, who am the worst, if but a branch might
grow for me.
I dare not think of offering at any thing in this
Address, that might look like a Panegyrick, for
fear lest when I have done my best, the World
should Condemn me, for saying too little, and
you your self check me, for medling with a Task
unfit for my Talent.
For the description of Vertues, and Perfecti∣ons
so rare as yours are, ought to be done by as
deliberate, as skillful a Hand; the Features
must be drawn very fine, to be like, hasty dawb∣ing
would but spoil the Picture, and make it so
unnatural, as must want false lights to set it off:

And your Vertue can receive no more Lustre from
Praises, than your Beauty can be improv'd by
Art; which as it Charms the bravest Prince that
ever amaz'd the World with his Virtue: So let
but all other Hearts enquire into themselves, and
then Judge how it ought to be prais'd.
Your Love too, as none but that great Heroe
who has it could deserve it, and therefore, by a
particular Lot from Heav'n, was destin'd to so ex∣traordinary
a blessing, so matchless for itself, and so
wondrous for it's Constancy, shall be remembred
to your Immortal Honour, when all other Trans∣actions
of the Age you live in shall be forgotten.
But I forget that I am to ask Pardon for the
fault I have been all this while Committing:
wherefore I beg your Highness to forgive me this
presumption, and that you will be pleas'd to think
well of one who cannot help resolving with all
the Actions of Life, to endeavour to deserve it:
Nay more, I would beg, and hope it may be
granted, that I may through yours never want an
Advocate in his Favour, whose Heart, and Mind,
you have so entire a share in; it is my only Porti∣on
and my Fortune; I cannot but be happy, so long
as I have but hopes I may enjoy it, and I must be
Miserable, should it ever be my ill Fate to lose it.
This, with Eternal wishes for your Royal High∣nesses
Content, Happiness, and Prosperity, in all
Humility is presented by
