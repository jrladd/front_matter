AMong all manuall Arts vsed in this Land, none is more famous for de∣sert, or more beneficiall to the Common-wealth than is the most necessa∣rie Art of Clothing. And therefore as the benefite thereof is great, so are the professors of the same to be both loued and maintained. Ma∣ny wise men therefore, hauing deepely con∣sidered the same, most bountifully haue be∣stowed their gifts for vpholding of so excel∣lent a commoditie, which hath been, and yet is, the nourishing of many thousands of poor people. Wherefore to you, most worthy Clothiers, do I dedicate this my rude worke, which hath raised out of the dust of Forget∣fulnesse

a most famous and worthie man, whose name was Iohn Winchcombe, alias Iacke of Newberie, of whose life and loue I haue briefly written, and in a plaine and humble manner, that it may be the better vnderstood of those for whose sake I took pains to com∣pile it, that is, for the well minded Clothiers; that heerein they may behold the great wor∣ship and credit which men of this trade haue in former time come vnto. If therefore it bee of you kindly accepted, I haue the end of my desire, and thinke my paines well recompen∣ced: and finding your gentlenesse answering my hope, it shall moue mee shortly to set to your sight the long hidden History of Thomas of Redding, George of Glocester, Richard of Worcester, and William of Salisbury, with diuers others; who were all most notable members in the Common-wealth of this Land, and men of great fame and dignity. In the meane space, I commend you all to the most high God; who euer increase, in all perfection and prosperous estate, the long ho∣noured trade of English-Clothiers.
