My Lord,
YOur Lordship's favourable Rece∣ption,
some Years since, of my
Character of an Honest Man,
whether call'd Whigg or Tory, and Vin∣dication
of the Succession; then presented
by my particular order into Your Hands
by the Bookseller, hath now emboldned me to
affix Your Lordship's Name to this Serious,
and (I hope) Seasonable Discourse: The
Design whereof, being the promoting of the
Honour of the Supreme Majesty of Hea∣ven
and Earth, of True Religion and Ver∣tue,
of Loyalty and Love to our Graci∣ous

Sovereign, of Truth and Justice, Ʋ∣nity
and Peace among us at Home, yea,
throughout Christendom. Which therefore
(although but a small and mean Pamphlet)
may humbly crave Your Lordship's Patro∣nage:
Be pleased, however, to vouchsafe
Your Lordship's Pardon to him, who can∣not
but still persist in the Detestation of all
Knavery and Dishonesty, whether Civil or
Religious; and endeavour to approve him∣self
Faithful to GOD, affectionately Loy∣al
to his Prince, a True Son of the Church
of England, in its present Establishment;
And therefore, as such, he takes the Bold∣ness
to subscribe himself,
My Lord,
Your Lordship's most Humble
and Devoted Servant,
