NOBLE Knights: When I had read ouer this Discourse, and waighed the sincerity of the Author, and how iustly in taxing his owne Country, he hath laid open the errours of Ours; and not onely searched the bottome of our corruptions, but prescribed a dyet and a remedy, both to preuent and cure their contagions. And seeing how cu∣stome and euill example hath misled all sorts, euen of the most peaceable natures, to such im∣patience,

good husbands of your Honours, Liues, and Soules: which I thought my selfe obliged to ad∣uertise you of, as a testimony of the seruiceable and sincere good wishes of
