THe directi giuen to Salomons young man,


as an Orient starre to guide you to Heauen, as the Commet in the
East was to the wise men, as it were a hande to leade them to
Bechlehem,Matth. 2. 9. the place where Christ was. I wish (if it e the will
of God) that you liue yet many yeres, to the glorie of God, and the
comfort of your godly friends: and that you may long goe with a
staffe for verie age: yet it will not be amisse in the meane time,
to giue you summons of death. For this cause I tender you this
Doomes-day discourse, wishing you to feed vpon it in your soule,
as vpon a Restoratiue, and to eate it vp, as the Prophet did the
Rowle that God gaue him, You shall not die the sooner: but hapâˆ£pily
to the world the sooner. Though I doubt not but you haue
hitherto so liued, as you may bolly say vpon your dying bed,
I am not ashamed to liue, and I am not oath
to die. The grce of our Lord Iesus
Christ bee with you,
Amen.
