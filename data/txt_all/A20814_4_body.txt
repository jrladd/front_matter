LEarned and noble Lord, custome and con∣tinuance haue sealed this priuiledge to Po∣etry, that (sometime) the light subiect of a laboured Poem, is graced with the title of a learned and iudiciall censor: your Lord∣ship sufficiently knoweth what I but put you in remem∣brance off, your wisedome and experience know what hath beene most vsuall in the course of times: your iudgement makes me doubtfull, being what I am: your honor giues me some comfort, beeing what you are: Counsell is not euer con∣uersant with seueritie, and I know true vertue loueth, what is neuer so little like herselfe, howe vnseasoned so euer my rymes seeme to the worlde: I am pleased if you peruse them with patience. Thus wishing my lines may bee as acceptable as I desire, I leaue them to your learned censor.
