Heroïck Sir!
LOng and earnest have been the de∣sires, and praiers of many thousands of faithfull hearts for your safe and happie return
into England, which God for his own glorie, your honor, and our comforts, hath now opportunely brought to pass with such testi∣monies of his blessings upon your actions, ma∣nifested by your succes∣ses in his battails, as may beejustly terrible to all his, and your Ene∣mies; and truly joyfull to all his servants, and your friends; of whom it is to be feared, that as
God hath but few firm in his election, so you have but few faithful in your assistance. Be plea∣sed therefore that it may bee inquired in the As∣sembly, vvhose promises to your self, and your de∣pendants, vvhose Votes in publick, and Vovves in private have most vvilfully failed you and yours: I shall not pre∣sume to inquire vvhat breaches have bin made of performances in mat∣ters
most nearly concer∣ning you, and your Ar∣mie best knovvn to your self: but vvhat hath been performed of those promises made to you, and your Armie for the relieving of your dai∣ly Orators, Prisoners for Debt, vvrongfully re∣streined, contrary to Magna Charta, and all the true Lavvs of the Land, vvhich men sitting in Parliament publickly profess, and have often
svvorn to maintein: what ridiculous Acts even those men have made to delude you and your Orators, their own and all Gods people, to cross those Laws more then before, and to sup∣port their extortions, & mercenarie practices in all the waies of Inju∣stice, in an higher mea∣sure than their Predeces∣sors: what Justice can be expected from such Justicers? what merci
can bee exspected from God to continue upon that Land that shall suf∣fer such Mountibanck-mock-lawes to live, much more to sit, and bee Legis-lators amongst them? oh! let such buy∣ers & sellers of Law & Justice bee thrown out of the Temple, and the Hous of the Lord bee purged of such abomi∣nations. The valiant and Religious Patriot Colonel Pride (in your
absence) indeavoured to work som proportion of grace into those men, to foresee and prevent their own confusion; but the Adders would not hear: O make them (Sir!) make these subtile Serpents innocent a∣gainst their wills; un∣sting them, unskin them; for their Cases are far more precious then their Carkases. I have here following demon∣strated their uselessness
in this Common∣wealth? which may it pleas your honor to peruse at your leisure, protect in your favor, correct in your wis∣dom, and Act in your Justice; so God shall fur∣ther prosper you & your posteritie, the Commonwealth honor you and them, and with the rest of your Orators, and theirs, I shall bee ever yours to Command du∣ring life,
