IT may seem strange vnto you (truely honourable Lorde) that a stranger should dedi∣cate a Booke vnto you: but, wonder not. For, though I

be not knowen to your Ho∣nour, yet your Honor is wel knowen vnto me: and (in∣deed) to whom not? I haue no small time (be it spoken without blasphemie) euen worshipt your Worth; and therefore now offer vp vnto it, all the reuenewes of my reuerence. I was the rather induced to dedicate it to your Honour, by reason that my father was a neigh∣bour to your Father, being much obliged vnto him; and my whole Family vnto your selfe. And next of all, to giue you thankes in the be∣halfe of all Gentrie; which is daylie bettered by your

Lordships directions, and furtherances in all honest courses. Desert was fled in∣to the Desert, before your Lordship called her home from exile, & clad hir wea∣ther-beaten limmes. And (which draweth neere vnto a miracle) your Lordship doth not imitate the greatest part of the hodiernall No∣bilitie, Qui beneficia in ca∣lendario seribunt. But whe∣ther goe I? knowing that your monosyllables, as also short speeches, are pleasing to GOD sometimes, and to Great-men at all times. Accept then this Leafe rather then Booke, toge∣ther

with my vowed and owed seruice: which though I offer serò, tamen seriò, my e∣uer honoured Lord.
