YOƲ see here, my highly-esteemed Friend, part of a certain Excellent Writing, digested
into brief Aphorisms, as a Compendium of all those things which Phylosophers are
wont to observe, about the great Work of their Stone: Not that all things are here expounded
which belong to the Compleat Description of the Physical Tincture; for there are more things
yet behind, with which the Author intends to adorn it; inasmuch as he hath determined to fortifie
these Aphorisms which he hath here emitted, from the Au∣thority of the Principal
Phylosophers: in which Work he will accurately explain the Similitudes, Figures, and other
ob∣scure and confused manners of speaking, which every where occur in the Writings of
Phylosophers. That so at length those things which hitherto have been de∣livered
too intricately, and confusedly by most Writers, may appear in some Me∣thodical
Order. Nevertheless, the principal scope of this Author, is not so much to expose or set
forth his own In∣ventions, as to reduce the valuable Say∣ings of others into order; which he
wil∣lingly submitteth to the Judgment and Examination of those, who have made a greater
Progress in the Art than him∣self.
But although I know this to be the pur∣pose of the Learned Author, nevertheless I chuse
rather to transmit this little work to you, imperfect as it is, that you may weigh it, and
cause it to be printed, then that the Sons of Art should any longer want this small help;
that it may give a light to those who err and go astray in the midst of darkness.
And that the Author may judge from the event of this his labour, whether it will be worth his
Pains to emit the whole Work to the World. Farewel my good Friend, and let me continue to have a
place in your Favour.
Dated at Vienna,
the 2d. of Septemb. 1687.
