THE often desires of many my good friends, Right honora∣ble, and the consideration of many vntrue incorrected cop∣pies of diuers my songs spred abroade, haue beene the two causes, chiefly mouing my consent at length to put in Print the fruits of my small skill and labors in Musicke. Then the dutie, honor, and seruice due from mee vnto your Lordship, together with the remembrance of your iudgement and loue of that Art, did moue & imbolden mee to present this first printed worke of mine in English, to passe vnder your L. fauour & protection: vnworthie I confesse, the view or Patronage of so worthie a Personage. Yet remembring that small things sometime do great seruice, & that repose is best tasted by bodies foreweari∣ed: I hoped that (by this occasion) these poore songs of mine might happely yeeld some sweetnesse, repose, and recreation vnto your Lordships mind, after your dayly paines & cares taken in the high affaires of the Cōmon VVealth. Most humbly beseeching your Lordship, that if my boldnesse heerein bee faultie, my dutifull good will, and good meaning may excuse it: which if I may so fortunately perceiue, it shall incourage mee to suffer some other things of more depth and skill to follow these, which beeing not yet finished, are of diuers expected and desired. Incessantly beseeching our Lord to make your yeeres happie, and end blessed, I wish there were any thing in mee worthie of your Lordship to be commanded.
