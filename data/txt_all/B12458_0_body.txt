GOod Mistresse WALTER, the plentifull fruites of your Christian loue towards vs, and many others, doe not onely binde vs to offer vp our Prayers and prayses to God for you in priuate, but also to giue some more ap∣parant testimonie of our vn∣fained thankefulnesse vnto your selfe, as being a speciall instrument of our good and comfort.
Here therefore we present vnto you this small Treatise, not doubting of your fauourable acceptance thereof, when our former VVritings did onely passe by you, you alwayes called them in, and gaue them kind entertainement, not onely in your House, but in your heart; and therefore these now that come vnder your owne Name, and cast them∣selues vpon your fauour, cannot bee vnwelcome. If your successe in Reading, bee answerable to our desire and pur∣pose
 in writing, you shall not loose your labour. And thus with all thankefull remembrance of our duetie, wee here commit you to the gracious protection of Almightie God, beseeching him to make perfect that good worke which hee hath in great mercie begunne in you, and aboundantly to recompence all your kindnesse and goodnesse to his Seruants, in multi∣plying his comfort and blessings vpon you and yours for euer.
