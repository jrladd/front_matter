Right Honourable,
WOrshipfull, and louing Country-men, I haue named
my Booke and Voyage, The Worst, or the Best,
which Ieuer vndertooke & finished, and it lyes in your
pleasures, to make it which you please; I am sure for
toyle, trauaile, and danger, as yet I neuer bad a worse,
or a more difficult passage, which the ensuing Dis∣course
will truly testifie; yet all those perils past, I shall account as plea∣sures,
if my infallible Reasons may moue or perswade you to clere your
Riuer, and make it Nauigable from the Sea to your Citie; I haue in
part touched what the profit and Commodities of it will be vnto you, and I
haue briefly shewed the Inconueniences which you haue through the want
of it: I haue also declared, that the maine intent or scope of my comming
vnto you with a Wherry, was, to see what lets or Impediments were the
binderances vnto so good and beneficiall a worke. All which I haue
(according to my simple Suruey, and weake Capacity) set downe, which
with the merrinesse of my most Hazardous Sea-progresse, I humbly De∣dicate
to your Noble, Worshipfull, and worthy Acceptances, euer ac∣knowledging
my selfe and my Labour in your seruices to be commanded
in all dutie,
