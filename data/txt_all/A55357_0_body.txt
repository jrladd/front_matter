I Shall not need to derive any confidence from the long acquaintance and friendship hath passed between us, to presse you to the Patronage of this work, when there are so many other Considerations that in a manner force it on you, as ha∣ving a certain right in it; it is the account of many a years Stewardship, the product of many a mid∣night thought, during my relation to you and those young Gentlemen committed by you to my charge and oversight, in a word, it had the first and last hand put to it, that is, ows both its originall and perfection to your house at HAD∣LEY. There are indeed abroad in the world many books conducing to the improvement of youth in good Letters, whereof it may be said of some, they are superfluous, of others they are burthensome, and by multiplicity of instruction di∣stract

the Learner. And this proceeds partly from an itch of reputation, which even those of that laborious, (nay, by many sleighted) pro∣fession are not free from, partly from the diffi∣culties that attend the education of youth, and partly from that generall humour, in most men of discovering their invention in furnishing the world with something that is new, or their wit in reforming and advancing what had been done by others. But for this of mine, you are not ignorant of the difficulty of the attempt, what a strange multitude of Authors I have been forced, as it were to anatomise, and that I may say, without any great losse of Modesty, that there never came yet abroad so methodicall an Insti∣tution of ENGLISH POESIE. For you, who look on education through other prospe∣ctive glasses than those of necessity or advantage, know, that it requires a person of generous incli∣nations, that as an exrprest Architect, layes the solid foundations of humane life, and un∣dertakes a businesse that hath the greatest influ∣ence on Policy, Morality, and Religion.
This once granted, no pains, no care, no vigi∣lancy can be too great that is spent upon the cul∣tivation of these noble plants, were there only this inducement that we should transmit them such to posterity as that they may in them per∣ceive our care and tendernesse. Upon these

grounds did I enter into the present relation to you, which being, as I said, a stewardship, it is but just I should bring something to testifie my faith∣fulnesse. You know how beneficial this work hath been where it was brought forth, and exer∣cised, and I leave it to you, either to communi∣cate it, or conceale it. If ever it come abroad into the world, I desire it may be under the con∣duct of your name, that, for your particular, it may be satisfied how much you have contributed to the the Commonwealth of Learning, and, for mine be convinced, how conscientious I have been in the discharge of my duty, what great re∣spects I have for you, and how passionately desi∣rous I am to expresse my self,
Sir,
