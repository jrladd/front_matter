SIR,
I Hope you'll Pardon my Pre∣sumption, if I trouble you to read this Book, in your leisure hours (if you have any from doing Good) which I partly Translated, and partly Compos'd in Mine. I must humbly Re∣quest another Favour from you, and that is your Protection (if it is not an Encroachment) be∣cause you are qualifi'd to Judge of the Performance, and (if you approve of it) to defend me a∣gainst
the unmannerly Censures of ill-natur'd Men. I take this Opportunity likewise, publickly to acknowledge my great Obli∣gations both to you, and your good Lady, whose exten∣sive Charity, and exemplary De∣votion, prevent my just Com∣mendations of her to the World. The fulsome Flatteries which u∣sually fill the Dedications of indi∣gent, cringing Authors, oblige me not to display your Vertues, and Accomplishments, which have been conspicuous, both in our own, and Neighbouring Coun∣tries. It was the Opinion of the most Learned Rabbins, (as Menas∣seh Ben-Israel informs us in this Treatise) That a Man's Life might be prolong'd by medi∣tating
on God's Law, and keep∣ing his Commandments; now since this seems highly probable, I have good Reason to believe, you may religiously expect as long, and as Happy a Course of years, as some of your pious Fa∣mily have arriv'd to. I may without the imputation of Flat∣tery, confidently affirm the same of your sincerely vertuous La∣dy.
That you may both enjoy, (till a good old Age gently leads you to decay) the same Health, and the same Comforts you do now, is the hearty Wish of,
