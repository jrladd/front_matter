SIR,
AMongst many, to whom my poore labours owe much for their acceptation, J know none that can challenge so deepe a debt as your selfe. If others haue tasted of my well-meant papers, you haue fed heartily on them; and so made them your owne, that your memory may compare with others eyes, and your practice with the speculation of others: Neither haue your hand or tongue beene niggardly dissemblers of your spi∣rituall gaine. Vnto you therefore (to whose name I had long since in my desires deuoted my next) doe J send this meane present: A Ser∣mon importunately desired of many: That which the present Au∣ditors found vsefull, the Presse shall communicate to posteritie; The gaine of either, or both, is no lesse mine: I doubt not, but you haue already so acted that part of this discourse which concerneth you, that the direction I giue to others, is but an historie of what you haue done. And goe on happily (worthy Sir) in those your holy courses which shal leade you to immortalitie; and so vse your riches, that they may be made vp into a Crowne for your head in a better world: My hearty well-wishes shall not be wanting to you and your vertuous Ladie, as whom you haue obliged to be iustly
Worcester, April 14.
