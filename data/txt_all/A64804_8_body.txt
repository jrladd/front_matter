MY LORDS,
IF this little Treatise which I humbly present to your Lordships, may be favoura∣bly accepted as a pledge of my grateful Acknowledge∣ments, and may beget in your Lordships a firm belief that my real intentions are to employ my best endeavours in the discharge of that Trust your Lordships have reposed in me, I have obtained the utmost of my desires; beseeching your Lordships to consider more the matter therein contained (which the greatest and wisest of men in all ages have esteemed as one of the most no∣ble Sciences, and the most necessary for the set∣tlement and preservation of a flourishing Com∣monwealth) then the rough and unpolished stile of the Writer, remembring that Souldiers and persons of my profession (as your Lord∣ships very well know) ought much rather to ponder their Actions, then to study the need∣less ornament of Words; as likewise to rest as∣sured, that the continuation of your Lordships
 affection towards me, will not onely encourage me to a stedfast and unwearied perseverance in my zeal for your Service, but likewise to proceed to some other undertakings of the like nature, for the good and benefit of your City, and of the whole Commonwealth. And so I remain,
My Honourable, &c.
