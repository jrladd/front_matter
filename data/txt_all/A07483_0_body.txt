SIR, in kindnes to requite some part of your curtesies, who haue tyed me vnto you as in the debt of friendship: I haue chosen your selfe as the fittest Patron, vnder whose protectiō I might put forth these vnpolished lines of the Authors: which though of themselues they deserue not so general an applause, as popular affection haue linked vnto other mens la∣bours: yet let the worth of the subiect somewhat strengthen the weakenes of the outward semblance, and so feeding a yong muse with the shew of a friend∣ly smile, as accepting his good will, though your ex∣pectation be not fully satisfied in his worke, you shall

imbolden him in a better vaine to performe some more perfect labour, that may deserue more fauour. VVhich if it happen into my hands, I will make your selfe a partaker of that, for your forward acceptance of this. Fare you well.
