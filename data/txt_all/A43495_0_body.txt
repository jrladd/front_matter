My Lord,
MAn had at the first, and so have all souls before their entrance in∣to the body, an explicite
 methodicall knowledge, but they are no sooner vessel'd, but that liberty is lost, and nothing re∣mains but a vast confused notion of the creature; thus had I only a Capacity without power, and a will to do that, which was farr enough above me; in this perplexity I studied se∣verall Arts; for my own sullen fate hath forced me to severall courses of life, but I finde not one hither
 to which ends not in Sur∣fets, or satiety, and all the Fortunes of this life are follyes: thus I rameld over all those inventions which the ignorance of men call Sciences; but these endeavours sorting not to my purpose, I Studied then the Semi∣nall forms of things; The Soul of Man, the diffe∣rence betwixt the Soul of an Angell and an hu∣mane Soul, the Nature
 of God, the Order of Spirits; how they give splendor to the Stars and Planets, how Sensation, Immagination, Reason and Memory are made, and how the bodyes of Ghosts have as much of solid corporeall substance in them as the bodyes of men, what kinde of pu∣nishments the Aerial Of∣ficers inflict upon their Malefactours; and how the spirit of nature is pre∣sent
 every where, and snatcheth into consent the immagination of the mo∣ther, which forcibly re∣teyns the note, and will be sure to seale it on the body of the Infant, for what rude inchoation the soul of the World has be∣gun in the matter of the Faetus, this signature is comprehended in the whole designe, and after∣wards compleated by the presence and operation of
 the particular soul of the Infant. After I knew what the soul was before it came into the body: I found presently what it was in the flesh; then all I de∣sired was but to keep my body in health, and this being obteyned: I went yet further, To see what would become of the Genii, when the firing of the World has done due execution upon that unfor∣tunate crue, and tedious
 and direfull torture has wearied their afflicted Ghosts that are earthly, in∣to an utter recesse from all matter, and thereby into a profound sleep or death; that after a long series of years, when not only the fury of the fire is utterly slaked, but that vast Atmos∣phere of Smoke & Vapours, which was sent up during the time of the Earths con∣flagration, has returned back in Copious Showers
 of Raine which will again make Seas and Rivers, will bind and consolidate the ground; and falling excee∣ding plentifully all over, make the soyle pleasant and fruitfull and the Aire coole and wholsome, that Na∣ture recovering thus to her advantage, and becomming youthfull again, and full of genital Salt & moisture, the souls of all living creatures belonging to these lower Regions of the Earth and
 Aire, will awaken orderly in their proper places, the Seas and Rivers will be a∣gain replenished with fish; the Earth will send forth all manner of fowles, foure foo∣ted beasts, creeping things; & the Souls of men also shall then catch life from the more pure and Balsa∣mick parts of the Earth, and be cloathed again in terre∣striall bodies; and lastly the Aeriall Genii, that Ele∣ment becoming again whol∣some
 and vitall, shall in due order and time, awaken and revive in the cool rorid Aire, which expergefaction into life is accompanied say they, with propensions answera∣ble to those resolutions they made with themselves in those fiery torments, & with which they fell into their long sleep, this is the prima∣tive truth of the Creation, the Antient, real Phyloso∣phy of the Hebrews and E∣gyptians, But new Philo∣sophy
 to our common Scribers, and I propose it not for your instruction, Nature hath already in∣riched you with Learning, judgment and Candor, and I would make you my Patron not my Pupill; if therefore amongst your serious and more deare re∣tirements, you can allow this Edilis but some few Minutes, and think them not lost, you will per∣fect
 my Ambition, that is to present my self,
My Lord
