The Dialogue is not tedious, nor the matter so serious, but it may passe the musters of a merry humor: wherein the Taker shall find

My hope is you will take all in good part, and smile at them that are so mistaken in their wits, that they know not well, what to take well. But lest I take too long a time, in troubling you with a longer preface, then either the matter requireth, or your patience will admit: with many thankes for your many vndeserued kind passages (of which, I haue taken such remembrance, as I hope shal one day be better considered) lea∣uing my booke to your kind patro∣nage, and my loue to your like employment; I rest al∣wayes
