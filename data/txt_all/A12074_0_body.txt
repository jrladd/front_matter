SIR, I must needs discharge two Epistles vpō you the one
the Readers, that should be like haile shot▪ that scatters
and strikes a multitude, the other dedicatory, like a bul∣let,
that aimes onely at your selfe: if either doe strike you,
it shal bee at your choice, whether I shall hit you in
the head, to let you vnderstand my meaning, or in the heart,
to make you conceiue my loue: yet I must confesse, I had ra∣ther
expresse my loue out of the flint, then my meaning in a∣ny
part of the shot. I aime at you rather then the Reader, be∣cause
since our trauailes I haue bene pregnant with desire to
bring foorth something whereunto you may be witnesse, and
now being brought a bed if you please to bee Godfather, I
doubt not bt this childe shal be wel maintained, seeing hee
cannot liue aboue an houre with you, and therefore shall in∣treat
you, when he is dead, he may be buried deepe enough in
your good opinion, and he shall deserue this Epitaph:
Heere lies the Childe, who was borne in mirth,
against the strict rules of all Childe-birth:
and to be quit, I gaue him to my friend,
Who laught him to death, and that was his end.
