My Lord, and Gentlemen,
IF this Paper shall presume with too much Con∣fidence, to Crowd in it Self amidst the weigh∣tyest of Your Affairs; and the Discourse therein be found too Weak, to make good those Publick Advantages promised in the Title: Be pleased, in Favour of the Good Intention of the Designer, to Receive it as a Well-meant New-Year's-Gift, Offered to the Common Good of the City.
The Design it brings with it, Is chiefly for the Improve∣ment of the City-Buildings; by proposing a Way for the Raising such a Joint-Stock, as may Assure the Re-build∣ing of their Casualties happening by Fire.
The Undertaking seems so Great and Hazardous, that a Million of Pounds Sterling, may be expected with it, to make it Practicable, to the Satisfaction of the several Inter∣essed.
This pretends not to be Accompanyed with such a Bank; and yet in Prospect, it may equally Answer the Expectation of those that may be Concerned; and the Purchase thereof may be
at a much Easier Rate, than can Rationally be Contracted for, with any Bank in the World.
It cannot better be Compared, than to that in Practice a∣mongst the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Life-Guard; who, at this Day, by a Mutual Agreement, Contribute towards the Buying of Horses for their Fellow-Soldiers, which either Dye, or become Ʋnserviceable; whereby the Rider is again speedily Mounted at the Common Charge; to which, per∣haps, his Peculiar Stock could not easily Arrive.
It is now designed, that the Houses which shall he Burnt down, may proportionably with as much Ease to the Pro∣prietors, be Rebuilt amongst themselves, as those Horses are Bought at the small Charge of the Riders.
Should Your Lordship, with the Right Worshipful the Aldermen and Common-Council, upon the Perusal, approve the Design to be for a Publick Good; I shall not doubt of Your Zeal, in Promoting it that it may be made to appear the same in Practice, as it is Presented in the Proposals: Only, let me beg, That if it falls short of the End that it promises, That You would be pleased to Pardon the Presumption of Him, who out of a Tender Affection to his Country, and the Place of his Nativity, with all humble Submission, Dedicates this Offering to the Greater Wisdom of Your Lordship: And with all Reverence and Respect, Subscribes himself,
