My Lord,
THe honour I have had (for some years past) of being of your Lord∣ships acquaintance hath given me assurance of troubling your Great∣ness, at present, with a Dedication. But when your Lordship shall un∣derstand

to whose sacred protecti∣on your illustrious name is called upon; and that no less than the dead Ashes of your noble Ance∣stors, humbly lay themselves  your Honours feet (branch'd  their several Stems, and mix'd with those of the Bloud-Royal o England:) I am confident my in∣vitation will want wings, and come too late, compared to your Lord∣ships fervent wishes and willing desires to embrace them: For that innate piety wherewith your ex∣cellent Progenitors have in all ages signalized themselves is more par∣ticularly eminent in you, as imme∣diately deriving it from so great a stream of virtue as your renown∣ed

Father, the present Duke of Norfolk.
Our Chronicles, our Histories, our Records are all full of the glo∣rious Actions, and puissant Name of the Howards. The lofty Stru∣ctures and Princely Fabricks disper∣sed here and there in this our Island of Great Britain silently speak the Magnificence of their Founders your Predecessors: And those who have had the opportunity of being abroad, and have passed through France, Flanders, Brabant, Germany, even to Rome it self, can want no occasion of beholding the pious footsteps of your Religioce∣ors, by those many marks o un∣ and liberality they have left be∣hind

them. And as if Europe alone were too little to have so great a name confined within its bor∣ders, you have made a descent into Asia, from thence into Affrick, and planted your fame in no less than three parts of the habitable World. To whom then,
My Lord, could I more properly offer these my endeavours but to your self, if for no other reason than that you in∣herit as well the virtues as the ho∣nours of such renowned Ancestors. But when I shall declare, That it was always my intentition to pre∣sent your Lordship with the first fruits of these my poor labours ever since I had the honour of knowing

your Lordship, by reason of that affable disposition and generous temper I constantly beheld in your great mind, I hope your Lordship will pardon my intrusion, and give me leave upon your own account to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
