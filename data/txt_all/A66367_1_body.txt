Noble and Worthy Gentlemen,
WHose true faithfulness to your King, and great Valour in the Wars under∣taken to defend the best King on Earth,And to say the truth, I blame not all the Souldiers, and Commissioned Officers, when I found very many of them very honest, & very religious men; and some of them have told me, they would not me∣dle and wish∣ed that the rest of the Soul∣diers would not meddle, with the lands or houses of the Church. and to preserve his undubitable Right unsnatched from him, by wicked Rebels; doth undoubtedly merit, in the judgement of all wise and honest men, no small Reward, far more than the reach of my under∣standing can express. Yet, ye must give me leave to tell you, That I should be heartily sorry, that any man could justly say, That your great Deserts were any wayes stained with the tincture of Sacriledge; which, I assure my self, you would never permit, if you conceived any thing that you do, to have the least affinity with that ugly Bastard-Brat.
Therefore I have undertaken, in the sincerity of my Conscience, and according to the best and uttermost of my knowledge, without the least ill thought of any of you all, or the least covetous desire, to take any thing from you, that is inoffensively your due: but to discharge the du∣ty,
 that I owe to God, and his Church, to compose this subse∣quent Treatise, concerning Sacriledge, and to shew, how hor∣rible & how odious a sin it is in the sight of God; how dero∣gatory and prejudicial it is to the Honour and Service of Jesus Christ; and how dangerous, and how it damnifieth those that commit it; the same being a Canker, that will eat, and consume, all that they have, before many Generations pass away; a sword, that will cut down their posterity from off the earth, and a sin that obligeth them to eternal damnation; without the great mercy of God to accept their great and unfeigned repentance for the same. And what you imagin I do herein against you, I do assure you, if you will believe me, it is not so much to get either lands or hou∣ses from you, as to hinder you, as I conceive, so deeply to wound your own selves: For, Better is a little that is duly gotten, without blame, and brings a blessing with it; than a great deal, that is unjustly obtained, with a curse at the heels of it. But you will say, That you do nothing but what you justly may do by the Laws of our Land, and what others do, and have done before you. And truly I do think so too: But I have fully answered this Allegation, and, as I suppose, whatsoever else can be said, in this Treatise; And I ask of you, Whether you conceive, that Humane Laws, and Acts of Parliament, made by powerful Com∣mands, and either through fear or errour; can make that which is against the Will, and contrary to the Law of God, to be no sin? or free the sinner from God's wrath? Or, do you think, that I stand against so many well-deserving Gentlemen, of such means and friends, and power, as you are, only for covetousness, to gain the Rent of a few hou∣ses; and no longer, than the remainder of a poor old man's life? Surely, not any one, that had but the least inch of worldly wisdom, would do so: For, besides my pains and labour, I have spent already, and shall spend yet, before the Church shall lose them, perhaps ten times more than my span-long life shall gain by them: And what of that? I have done my best, when I have lost them, Et liberavi animam meam, and shall leave to God Causam suam, Let
 him arise and defend his own Cause; but let men take heed, how they strive against God, or seek to obstruct his Service, and cause the diminution of his Worship: which, I hope, your Piety will never suffer any one of you to do. And I shall pray for you all, and assuredly remain,
