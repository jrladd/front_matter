YOur Circles, Sir, would make my folly ghess,
You were a Conjurer, though you wo'n't confess.
And Gauging is the rugged dev'lish Name
Of some Hobgobling Imp, the very same
That brought in Custome; but what e're he be,
He's a rare Fellow at the Rule of Three:
He doth just square the Circle; nay so true,
That the King's Right is given to a Cue.
There's none else such Impossibles can do:
You give the King's, I give this Right to you.
