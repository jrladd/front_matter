AS the Condition of KINGS and Princes puts them in a Station more obvious to the View and Observation of the World, than that of other Men, of whom (as Cicero observes) neither any Word or Action can be Ob∣scure; so are those Kings, during whose Appearance upon the Stage of this World it pleaseth the Great KING of KINGS singularly to make known unto Men the Wonderful Steps of his Ʋn∣searchable Providence, more signally Observed, and their Lives and Actions more diligently Remarked and Inquired into by Posterity: especially, if those things be such, as not only relate to the Outward Transactions of this World; but also are signalized by the Manifestation or Revelation of the Knowledge of God in Matters Spiritual and Reli∣gious. These are the things, that rendred the Lives of Cyrus, Au∣gustus Caesar and Constantine the Great in former times, and of Charles the Fifth, and some other Modern Princes in these last Ages so Con∣siderable.
But among all these Transactions, which it hath pleased God to per∣mit for the Glory of his Power, and the Manifestation of his Wisdom and Providence, no Age furnisheth us with things so Strange and Marvel∣lous, whether with respect to Matters Civil or Religious, as these, that

have fall'n out within the Compass of Thy Time; who, though thou be not yet arrived at the Fiftieth Year of Thy Age, hast yet been a Witness of stranger things, than many Ages before produced. So that, whether we respect those Various Troubles, wherein thou found'st thy self engaged, while scarce got out of thy Infancy; the many Different Afflictions, wherewith Men of thy Circumstances are often unacquain∣ted; the strange and unparallel'd Fortune, that befel thy Father; Thy own narrow Escape, and Banishment following thereupon; with the great Improbability of Thy ever Returning (at least without very much Pains and tedious Combatings;) or finally, the Incapacity thou wert under to accomplish such a Design, considering the Strength of those, that had possessed themselves of Thy Throne, and the Terror they had inflicted upon Forrein States: and yet that after all this Thou shouldst be Restored without Stroke of Sword, the Help or Assistance of Forrein States, or the Contrivance and Work of Human Policy; All these do sufficiently declare, that it is the Lord's Doing: which, as it is marvellous in our Eyes, so it will justly be a matter of Wonder and Astonishment to Generations to come; and may sufficiently serve, if rightly Observed, to Confute and Confound that Atheism, wherewith this Age doth so much Abound.
As the Vindication of the Liberty of Conscience, which thy Father by giving way to the Importunate Clamors of the Clergy (the answering and fulfilling of whose Ʋnrighteous Wills has often proved hurtful and pernicious to Princes) sought in some part to Restrain, was a great Occasion of these Troubles and Revolutions; so the Pretence of Consci∣ence was that, which carried it on, and brought it to that pitch, it came to. And though (no doubt) some that were Engaged in that work, designed good things, at least in the beginning, (albeit always wrong in the manner they took to Accomplish it, viz. by Carnal Wea∣pons) yet so soon as they had tasted of the Sweet of the Possessions of them they had turned out, they quickly began to do those things them∣selves, for which they had accused others. For their hands were found full of Oppression, and they hated the Reproofs of Instruction, which is the way of Life: And they evilly entreated the Messengers of the Lord, and caused to Beat and Imprison his Prophets, and persecuted his People, whom he had Called end Gathered out from among them; whom he had made to Beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, and not to learn Carnal War any more. But he Raised them up, and Armed them with Spiritual Weapons, even with his own Spirit and Power; whereby they Testified in the Streets and High-ways, and publick Markets and Synagogues against the Pride, Vanity, Lusts and Hypocrisy of that Generation, who were Righteous in their own Eyes; though often Cruelly Entreated therefore: and they faithfully prophesied and foretold them of their Judgment and Downfal; which came upon them: as by several Warnings and Epistles delivered to Oliver and Richard Cromwel, the Parliament and other then Powers yet upon Record, doth appear.
And after it pleased God to Restore Thee, what Oppressions, what Ba∣nishments and Evil Entreatings they have met with, by Men pretend∣ing Thy Authority, and Cloaking their Mischief with thy Name; is known to most Men in this Island; especially in England, where there is scarce

a prison, that hath not been filled with them; not a Judge, before whom they have not been haled: Though they could never yet be found Guilty of any thing, that might deserve that Usage. Therefore the Sense of their Innocency did no doubt greatly Contribute to Move Thee Three Years ago to cause some Hundreds of them to be set at Liberty: for indeed, their Sufferings are singular, and obviously distinguisha∣ble from all the Rest of such as live under Thee, in these Two Re∣spects.
First, In that among all Plots Contrived by others against Thee since thy Return into Britain, there was never any, owned of that Peo∣ple, found or known to be Guilty (though many of them have been taken and Imprisoned upon such kind of Jealousies) but were always found Innocent and Harmless, as became the followers of Christ, not Coveting after, nor Contending for the Kingdoms of this World; but subject to every Ordinance of Man for Conscience sake.
Secondly, In that in the hottest Times of Prsecution and the most violent Prosecution of those Laws made against Meetings (being cloathed with Innocency) they have boldly stood to their Testimony to God, without Creeping into Holes or Corners, or once Hiding themselves, as all other Dissenters have done; but daily Met according to their Cu∣stom, in the Publick Places Appointed for that End: so that none of thy Officers can say of them, That they have surprized them in a Cor∣ner; overtaken them in a Private Conventicle; or Catched them lurk∣ing in their Secret Chambers: nor needed they to send out Spies to get them, whom they were sure daily to find in their Open Assemblies Te∣stifying for God and his Truth. By which those, that have an Eye to see, may observe their Christian Patience and Courage, Constancy and Suffering joined in one, more than in any other people, that Differ from them, or Oppose them. And yet in the midst of those Troubles Thou canst bear Witness, that as on the one part they never sought to Detract from Thee, or to render Thee and thy Government Odious to the People by Nameless and Scandalous Pamphlets and Libels; so on the other hand they have not spared to Admonish, Exhort and Reprove Thee, and have faithfully Discharged their Consciences towards thee without flattering words: as ever the True Prophets in antient times u∣sed to do to those Kings and Princes, under whose Power Violence and Oppression was acted.
And albeit it be Evident by Experience to be most agreeable both to Divine Truth and Human Policy, To allow every one to serve God accor∣ding to their Consciences; nevertheless those other Sects, who for the most part durst not peep out in the times of Persecution, while these Innocent People stood bold and faithful, do now Combine in a Joint-Confederacy (notwithstanding all the former Janglings and Contention among themselves) to render us Odious; seeking unjustly to Wrest our Doctrine and Words, as if they were Inconsistent both with Christiani∣ty and Civil Society: so that to Effectuate this their Work of Malice against us, they have not been ashamed to take the Help and Commend the Labors of some Invidious Socinians against us. So do Herod and Pontius Pilate agree to Crucify Christ.
But our Practice known to thee by good Experience, to be more Consistent with Christianity and Civil Society, and the Peace and Wel∣fare

of this Island, than that of those, that thus Accuse us, doth suf∣ficiently guard us against this Calumny; that we may indeed Appeal to the Testimony of thy Conscience, as a Witness for us in the face of the Nation.
These things Moved me to present the World with a Brief, but True Account of this Peoples Principles in some short Theological Pro∣positions, which according to the will of God proving Successful beyond my Expectation, to the Satisfaction of several, and to the Moving in many a Desire of being further Informed concerning us (as being every-where Evil spoken of) and likewise meeting with Pub∣lick Opposition by some (as such will always do, so long as the Devil rules in the Children of Disobedience) I was thereby further engaged, in the Liberty of the Lord to present to the World this APOLOGY of the Truth held by those People; which, because of thy Inter∣est in them, and theirs in thee, as having first Appeared and most∣ly Increased in these Nations under thy Rule, I make bold to present unto Thee.
Thou know'st and hast Experienced their Faithfulness towards their God, their patience in suffering, their peaceableness towards the King, their honesty, plainness and integrity in their faithful Warnings and Testimonies to Thee: and if thou wilt allow thy self so much time as to Read this, thou may'st find, how Consonant their Principles are both to Scripture, Truth, and right Reason. The Simplicity of their Behaviour, the generality of their Condition (as being poor men and Illiterate) the manner of their procedures being without the Wisdom and Policy of this World, hath made many Conclude them Fools and Mad-Men, and neglect them, as not being Capable of Reason: But though it be to them as their Crown, thus to be Esteemed of the Wise, and Great and Learned of this World; and though they Rejoice to be accounted Fools for Christ's sake; yet of late some, even such, who in the World's Account are esteemed both Wise and Learned, begin to Judge otherwise of them; and find, that they hold forth things very Agreeable both to Scripture, Reason, and true Learning.
As it is Inconsistent with the Truth I bear, so it is far from me to use this Epistle, as an Engine to flatter thee (the usual Design of such Works) and therefore I can neither Dedicate it to thee, nor Crave thy Patronage, as if thereby I might have more Confidence to present it to the World, or be more hopeful of its Success: To God alone I owe what I have, and that more Immediately in matters Spiritual; and therefore to Him alone, and to the Service of his Truth I Dedicate, whatever Work he brings forth in me: to whom onely the praise and honour apper∣tains, whose Truth needs not the Patronage of Worldly Princes; his Arm and Power being that alone, by which it is propagated, established and confirmed. But I found it upon my Spirit to take occasion to pre∣sent this Book unto Thee: that as thou hast been often Warned by several of that people, who are Inhabitants of England; so thou may'st not want a Seasonable Advertisement from a Member of thy Ancient Kingdom of Scotland: and that thou may'st know (which, I hope, thou shalt have no Reason to be troubled at) that God is Raising up and Increasing that people in that Nation. And the Nations shall also hereby know, that the Truth we profess, is not a Work of Darkness, nor propagated by Stealth, & that we

are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, because we know it to be the Power of God unto Salvation: and that we are no ways so Inconsistent with Government, nor such Disturbers of the Peace, as our Enemies by Traducing us have sought to make the World believe, we are: for which to Thee I dare Appeal as a Witness of our peaceableness, and Christian patience.
Generations to come shall not more Admire that singular Step of Di∣vine Providence in Restoring thee to thy Throne without outward Blood∣shed; than they shall admire the Increase and Progress of this Truth without all outward Help, and against so Great Opposition; which shall be-none of the least things rendring thy Memory Remarkable. God hath done great things for thee; he hath sufficiently shewn thee, that it is By Him Princes Rule, and that He can pull down and set up at his pleasure. He hath often faithfully Warned thee by his Servants, since he Restored thee to thy Royal Dignity, that thy Heart might not wax Wanton against him to forget his Mercies and Providence to∣wards thee; whereby he might permit Thee to be soothed up and lul∣led asleep in thy Sins by the flattering of Court-Parasites, who by their fawning are the Ruin of many Princes.
There is no King in the World, who can so Experimentally testify of God's Providence and Goodness, neither is there any, who Rules so many Free People, so many True Christians: which thing renders thy Government more Honourable, and Thy self more Considerable, than the Accession of many Nations filled with slavish and superstitious Souls.
Thou hast Tasted of Prosperity and Adversity; thou know'st, what it is to be Banished thy Native Country; to be Over-ruled, as well as to Rule and Sit upon the Throne; and being Oppressed, thou hast reason to know, how hateful the Oppressor is both to God and Man: If after all these Warnings and Advertisements thou dost not Turn unto the Lord with all thy heart, but forget him, who remembred thee in thy Distress, and give up thy self to follow Lust and Vanity; surely, Great will be thy Condemnation.
Against which Snare, as well as the Temptation of those, that may or do feed thee, and prompt thee to Evil, the most Excellent and Pre∣valent Remedy will be, to Apply thy self to that Light of Christ, which shineth in thy Conscience, which neither can, nor will flatter thee, nor suffer thee to be at Ease in thy Sins; but doth and will deal plainly and faithfully with thee, as those, that are Followers thereof, have also done.
GOD Almighty who hath so signally hitherto visited Thee with his love, so Touch and Reach thy heart, e're the Day of thy Visitation be Expired, that thou may'st effectually Turn to him, so as to Improve thy Place and Station for his Name. So wisheth, so prayeth
From Ury, the place of my Pilgrimage, in my Native Country of Scotland,
the 25th of the Month, called No∣vember, in the Year 1675.
