Honoured Sir!
I Must confesse, a bet∣ter Artist should have scanned the Ja∣cobs-Ladder of your favours, a more famous Archimedes have taught his star-gazeing eyes to
feed on the Sunshine of your Courtesies, for the meer folly of Presumption, degraded the Cream of the Creation from Commencing Nobles in that Coelestiall Athens; And the high Element of perfection, where your Highnesse sits En∣shrined, DEITY is a Pitch a∣bove the sorage of my scarce-Penfeathered Muse, to fly with∣out the strong ambition of Eagles wings, whose Quick∣sighted eye, no Comet-Ray can force to obliquity. Yet I fear not, Gemms never were
Sullied for want of Cabinets, and Rosy-flowers, find alwaies som engrafture Caesar by chance came an Executor to Virgills Poëms, and if you deny, a cour∣teous entertainment, a Grave∣buriall may be had by any Sax∣on, Maecenas Patronized one from death, in the Living Mo∣nument of his breast, who him∣self said —Non tumulum quaero, sepelit Natura Relictos— I do Congratulate that from the Chaste debts, I owed to your goodnesse, an Incompar∣able, and new Phaenix is Pro∣duced
to cancell the Bonds of obligations, who (while she in∣tends no further a Progresse, then to live and die, in the Per∣fumed Indy of your breast) can never be aboriive, I do Con∣gratulate, that this new Star doth appear in our Horizon to adaequate your Superintendent merits; before I wanted a Ma∣thematick staffe, to take the Pole and high Elevation of them. SIR, as she's the Paragon of all Ladies, be you the Patron of all Patrons, would you be a resolved Paris; well, she is a re∣solute
Hellen: Are you a chaste Platonick, then she is a chaster Vestall, frowns or smiles disray from the Caelestiall Orb of your brows. She is in your Pro∣tection. While I rest Hers, and your Adorer.
