I Present vnto your Lordships view, the Modell of a Sermon, vnworthy I confesse, either of their publike life, or of so transcen∣dent a protection; modestly framed for the Pulpit, not curiously adorned for the Presse: wherein your Lordship may behold Pagan and Papal Rome, so mutually intertexed and folded vp into one Masse or Chaos, that you may safely pronounce the Hea∣then City to liue in this they call Christian: Yea, such is the dependancy, that if this Iezabel were stripped out of those Robes of Paganisme, she would well-nigh goe naked.
Many nations were conuerted to Christ by the preaching of S. Paul. Yet wee finde not such an honorable attribute gi∣uen to any of his Auditors, as to those who are said, To haue

receiued the Word with readinesse, and to haue searched the Scriptures dayly, to see whether the things preached by S. Paul were so or not: For they are stiled by the best Record Noble men. And nothing (Sir) hath added, or can adde more true noblenesse to all your other great Titles of Ho∣nour, then the like Zealous affections and actions in you to the Word of God, deliuered by his Ministers.
The dayly enlargement whereof in your Lordship, being Zealously coueted by my selfe: who although I am the weakest Labourer in Gods Vineyard, yet I haue presumed humbly to offer to your Lordship this little cluster of Grapes gathered from thence, and which I did lately in a Sermon deliuer vnto the Auditory then present: which if your Lordship will vouchsafe to take into your hands, to bruise it a little more, and to see and taste whether it sprung from the true Vine or not: I shall haue good hope that yet a little iuyce may thereby flow from thence to refresh some weake ones in the Church of God.
Which being the onely businesse that God hath set mee a∣bout, by any meanes to saue some; And all I haue to say to your Lordship at this time: With my humble acknowledge∣ment of your Lordships great fauours, and my hearty prayers to God to encrease dayly your Zeale to his true worship: I rest
