Right Reverend, and my much Honoured Lord,
WHen I waited on your Lordship, the last Summer, at the time of your publique-Ordination, I communicated to your Lordship the Papers, that now are printed in this small Booke.
Your Lordship was pleased to give
me incouragement to publish them, and withall to advise me to forbear any future reciprocation of this Saw, which some count their delight to draw, and retort. I should not have presumed to communicate these endeavours of mine in a con∣test so long managed by our learn∣ed Prelates, and other worthy Men of our English Church, but that I perceive, that our ordinary sort of people have not the opportunity to procure, nor leisure to peruse Books of larger Volumne; and Re∣verend Bishop Jewel's Apology (that might instruct them in the severall Questions in debate between the true, and pretended Catholiques, that is, betwixt the Protestants and the Romanists,) is rarely perused by the people of this Age, though it may possibly be found in some Churches.

What the Person is that sent me the Quaeries (extant I perceive in the booke called Fiat Lux) and who made the Reply to my Answer, I know not; but I perceived, that the people might easily be amazed by them, and disposed to judge the Church of Rome not at all chang∣ed from her primitive integrity, and thereupon the better inclined to desert our Communion.
In the Parish where I live, I perceive the Papists (and there are severall Families there of the Ro∣mish-perswasion) generally believe, that we have set up a new Religi∣on, that we have no Priests a∣mongst us, and consequently no Sa∣crament except (perhaps what their women in some cases by allowance do administer) Baptisme.

What effect such opinions do pro∣duce, is visible enough, in the spread∣ing of this error in this place, with∣in a few years by-past.
That we should do our best endea∣vours to acquaint the people that Rome is not such as sometimes she was; that England is not a Church bearing date since Henry the eight's Reigne; that our Divines are Priests duely ordained, that we have no defects in our Discipline, destructive to the being of a sound Church; and that salvation, may be obtained better amongst us, than in any Church in the world, is the common duty of all intrusted with the charge of souls.
What I am able to contribute to so good a work, I adventure to shew by this ensuing Discourse; and how
Zealous both myselfe, and all others, ought to be to have it done, the dan∣ger of such, as are misled from our Assemblies, doth abundantly demon∣strate.
That by Gods blessing this Skir∣mish, may confirme some that stand, establish some that stagger, and raise up some, that are fallen amongst us; I hope the rather, for that I have been encouraged thereunto by your Lordship; who, being so well skilled in the excellent structure of our settle∣ment, [which, were our Discipline advanced to the purity that our Church in the commination profes∣seth, is to be wished for, would fall but little short of the Primitive-constitution] hath alway been ready to maintain, that the pretensions of Rome (so far as she condemns, and dissents from us in the substantiall
parts of Religion,) are destitute of a solid foundation.
Your Lordships ability to defend and resolution to suffer for the Cause of our Church (both at home, and abroad) are so well known, that to speak anything of either of them is superfluous.
I crave your Lordships candid acceptance of this small work; and withall I humbly returne my thanks, for your Lordships patience in per∣using these Papers, and readiness to impart your Lordships direction and advice in severall particulars, and with my prayers that your Lord∣ship may enjoy that measure of health and length of life in your Diocesse that may enable you to settle it ac∣cording to the pious, and grave de∣signe of your Articles of Visitation,
and compleat your Reparations of those Ruines, that sacrilegious hands have made upon the Fabriques belonging to your Bishoprick (in ac∣complishing which good Enterprize I have been an eye-witnesse, that your Lordship forgetting your private concernes, spareth neither for cost nor paines) I rest
My Lord,
