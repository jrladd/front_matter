SIR, a weaker creature then man in Adam, the world affords not: a stron∣ger then a Christian, a man in Christ the earth beares not. The strong men of David2. Sam. 23.8. are in scriptures renow∣ned: yet what were their conquests, but over Gyants or fell beasts? Wee fight not against flesh and bloud: wee encounter and conquer, yeaRom. 8 37. overconquer the2. Cor. 4 4. God of this world. Principalities and powers, our head-strong selues, we rule, yea overrule, thorough Christ that raigneth in vs. The mightest amōg naturalists, if abasures haue not deiected, yet honors haue puffed vp: if penury hath not distracted, yet plen∣ty hath bewitched. ButPhil 4.12. we know how to abound, and how to bee abased: how to be full, and how to suffer neede. We can doe all things in Christ that strengthneth vs. It is said of some of Davids worthies,2. Sam. 23.19 they reached not to the first three. Nor we (we must confesse) to the Apostles measure: but yet we haue all received of the2. Tim. 1.7. spirit of pow∣er, every one his measure, according to the measure of the do∣nation
of Christ. It shall behooue vs to know our strength ei∣ther actuall or possible to all dueties necessary to salvation, that the idle pretense of absolute infirmity make vs not se∣curely presumptuous. And it nearely concernes vs, to ac∣knowledge the fountaine thereof, the mighty God in our weakenes perfitting his power: least selfeconceit make vs over confident in adventures; or vnthankfulnes, carelesse to referre our abilities to his glory. That comfort also would bee meditated, that the supply of strength is certaine when it is humbly sought, where & how it ought: that no sluggish feare of the Adversary dismay vs in the encounter. To this summe amounts this whole sermon.1. Pet. 5.10, 11. Now the God of all grace that hath called you to this eternall glory by Christ Iesus make you perfect, confirme, strengthen, and stablish you. To him be glo∣rie and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
