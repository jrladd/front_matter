Christian Reader,
THe Curse of God and his people (which is the subject of this following Pious and Elabourate discourse) never  more lp from Heaven, nor more servant prayers from earth, to be put up to the God of heaven, for then aaming of it, t  this time. For some there are (and not a sin) that are so engaged to their own in∣terests, that le the cause of God and his people, sink or swim, they care not, so their own nds be compassed, and their own designe & projects may find sure foong: and these are your self-loving worldly politicins, that are of this world, as Christ speaks and savour nothing but the things of the world, and seek , and not , that seek their own and not the things of Jesus Christ. Others there are so dissolute and prophane, & are risen up to such as height of impiety, that they do no more regard this Cause, than the air under then et, they are so arou∣nd in drink & other sensual delihts his, and are so heightned in their Oaths & blasphe and other abominations, tha God and his peoples cse are not in their thoughts:  if at any time this cse come into them  as, it is only to cast the foulest pers they can upon it, and to be spatter  with the bast obliquies and  speeches that the Devil & their own cursed hearts can invent, and to persecute it wi tongue &  and heart & hand to the highest degree of persecution, even unto bloud and slughter: though when they have done all that ever they , they shall not be able to  the cause nor the faithfull servants of Christ that ck ; but as the Primitive believers said of persecuting Nero, Nero may kill us, but he cannot hurt us; so may we say now. Others there are that seem to own this cause and adventure much this way, and may not only be willing to lose their liberty & estates, & the favour of great freinds, but go further also, yet afterward turn away & draw back, and these are hypocrites, which are either taken with the eye-lids of the aluring harlot the world, in the profits, plea∣sures & honours of it, or else are afraid of her frownes & discouragements, after all their former sufferings: they have ventured so far, but dare go no further, and so lise all they have wrought, and suffer in vain, these are not true to the case of God and his people, and by their puting away a good conscience, and wan of self-denial, make shipwrack of the faith and cause we speak of. Only there is a very few sincere ones that hold their own, and in the worst times deale pently, and discern both time and judgment, and are valiant for this cse. All which duty weighed and seriously considered, no wonder that this holy man of God being guided by his Spirit, made choise of this subject to preach upon, in that great Assembly at the Court

of Election, now in these dayes wherin so many turne their backs of God, and set themselves so desparately against H, & his peoples cause. I was to star us all up to besiege & beleag the re of Grace now in thse last and peilus dayes and times, to awake & stand to maintaine this cause, & to shew forth his Almighty power in crushing all the designes, and out-plotting all the plots of Sathan & his instruments that undermine this cause, and the Lord help us all to attend what God by his Spirit speaks to us, and now if ever, to pray & give God no rest, ll this cause be maintained against the faces & forces of all its enemies. The Sermon when preached was ac∣ceptable to all, and found general approbation among all the wise-hearted and godly, so far as we have heard.
Reader thou hast i to peruse, read it, understand thy time according to it, let the cause of God and his people lie neerer to thine heart then ever, and let thy sol awake more to be a Prince with God to prevaile, that this cause may be main aed & upheld against all the powers of darkness, and all the conspiracies of men on earth, and devills in hell, that it may be victorious, & ride in triumph till Christ come, who will own is before the whole world, and them that have stood for it, though it have cost them dear from those that have been the dspisers of it. We have no more to say, but to desire from our hearts that the blessing of heaven may go along with the labour of his Servant in this work, and that be & we, and whosoever read it, may find this fruit that we may tread in this wise Kings steps, who prayed so fervently, that God would maintain his cause & his peoples alwayes, as the matter shall require; Prayer of Faith opens all dores, prevailes for all blessings, hath such power with God that it never comes away empty, but as that renowned Emperour said, that he never sent any suer d w from his presence, so we may be sure that the Lord will do to them that sue to him, giving them all that they seek to him for (espe∣cially in maintaining his own and his peoples cause, which he cannot se forsaken) and will not send his suiters and suppliants sad away from him, they are bidden to come with boldnesse to he Throne of Grace. One word more & we have done, Jesus Christ that great Favourite by whom both our persons and prayers are accepted, and this cause comes to be maintained for the much Incense that he offers up with the prayers of all Saints, prevailes ever for us, & this cause when it and we the honour of both are laid most in the dust. To this Lord Jesus, with the blessed Father and Eternal Spirit, be Glory and Power everlasting. Amen.
