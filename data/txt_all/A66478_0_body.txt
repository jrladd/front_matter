SIR,
I Am not Insensible, how great a Presumption I
Commit, in casting my self and the ensuing Trea∣tise
at your Feet: Nor without a great Measure
of Confidence, (which your repeated Favours have often
Emboldned) should I ever have Attempted the same:
For which, as in the first place, I am Obliged to En∣treat
your Pardon, so in the next, your Acceptance.
As Inducements whereunto, I have no Gilded Com∣mendations
to Adorn the Present, no Flowers of Rhe∣torick
or Eloquence to Embellish the same; All that I
can say in its Behalf, being no more than what
the Loyalty of my Intentions was, in Writing it;
I did it for a good End, to Expose the Nations Worst
Enemies, and Unriddle their Plots and Conspi∣racies.
And tho hereby I'm Assured of Contracting the Ill-Will
and Censure of too many, who are, and (in
spight of Heaven it self,) will continue Incorrigi∣ble,
I shall Despise their Malice, and under the Um∣brage
of your Patronage Rest secure.
Nor indeed, could I ever have made Choice of a
better Security to defend my well designed, tho mean,

Performances, then Prefixing your Name thereunto;
All Good and Loyal Men Revere it, and the
Worst have an Awe and Regard for't; so strong are
the Charms of Vertue, that where she cannot Abso∣lutely
Conquer Inbred and Establisht Vice, yet the
most Vicious Esteem the Victor, and in their Hearts
acknowledg her Powers.
Your Early Loyalty Triumphed in the Worst of
Times, when Goodness was out of Fashion, you Wore
it; The prevailing Faction could neither Shame nor
Fright you, and your Practice made good your own
Maxim, That steady Loyalty is the surest
Foundation of the Kingdoms Felicity.
But Pardon me, (Dear Sir,) if I break off in
a Theme I could never say Enough, and all that could
be said, were much too little, and give me leave to
Conclude with my Wishes, for your Temporal and
Eternal Happiness, who am
