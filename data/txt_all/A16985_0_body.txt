I Present vnto your HIGHNES, an Exposition of the L.
Prayer, recorded in S. Mat. 6. euen as I spake it for summe
of matter. Many were desirous to haue it printed. And for
that I thought your MAIESTIE the fittest judge, for the com∣moditie
of your people. For a Rabbin who wrote from Constan∣tinople
seuen yeere agoe, to be taught from England, I would
print it in Ebrew, if your MAIESTIE will giue me leaue to goe
to Germanie, where my Librarie yet is; and some works which
our Printers can not set forth for want of skil & letters. And
I most humbly craue leaue to goe thither, & to print for truth
of Religion, all that my occasions suffer, for English, Ebrew, &
Greeke.
