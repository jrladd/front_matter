YEe that spared no time nor trauell, in the
setting forth, ordering, & furnishing of
this Masque, being the first fruits of ho∣nor
in this kinde, which these two socie∣ties
haue offered to his Maiestie: VVill not thinke
much now to looke backe vpon the effects of your
owne care and worke: for that whereof the successe
was then doubtfull, is now happily performed and
gratiously accepted. And that which you were then
to thinke of in straites of time, you may now peruse
at leysure: And you Sir Francis Bacon especially,
as you did then by your countenance, and louing
affection aduance it, so let your good word grace it,
and defend it, which is able to adde value to the
greatest, and least matters.
