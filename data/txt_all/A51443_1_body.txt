MADAM,
I Acknowledge it mine ambition, that I seek your Honor's Patron∣age; but dare adventure upon this guilt, in confidence of a Favora∣ble Pardon, as well as an Honora∣ble Protection, to your Suppliant. I know no vice in Morals unpar∣donable, like that of Ingratitude; and therefore to a∣void the sin and censure of this Apostacy, I declare it (Madam) your Reward of Goodness, exceeding the Merit of a former Present, which hath obliged the duty of this Dedication: What are the charitable sup∣plies of your Eleemosynary bounties (notwithstand∣ing, Modesty is at once the Vail and Ornament of your Vertues) there is a Trumpet of Honorable Fame that proclaims it; That I have my self received, an encou¦ragement of my Studies by your Nobleness, I willingly embrace this opportunity, thankfully to acknowledge and record. Besides (Madam) it were improper, to intitle the SOUL'S CONFERENCE, to any other,

then an experienced Piety; whose Spiritual Conflicts sustained, can give testimony to the Comforts admini∣stred; which not Greatness but Goodness, can best approve and Patronize.
Here then (Madam) to your Goodness, as great in Honor; and to your Honor, as great in Goodness; is humbly presented this Freewill-offering, the Work and the Author; and no Votary can do more, then make his whole Possession one Oblation, as ambitious to bear the name and attribute of being
NOBLE MADAM
