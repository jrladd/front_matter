TO thee (the same to me as first I meant)
Friend to the Muses, and the well-inclinde,
Louing, and lov'd of euery vertuous minde:
To thee the same, I the same Song present
(Our mutuall loue's eternall Monument)
Wherein, our Nephewes shall heer-after finde
Our constant Friendship how it was combinde
With linkes of kindnes and acknowledgement.
Accept again this Present in good part,
This simple pledge of my sincere affection
To Tangley, Thee, and thy Soon-calm-in-hart
(Perfect good-will supplies all imperfection).
Chameleons change their colour: Guile her game:
But (in both Fortunes) Vertue's still the same.
