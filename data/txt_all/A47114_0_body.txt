REVEREND SIR,
THIS small Treatise be∣ing the Product of some leasure hours, I happily enjoy in a College that is under the kind influence of your Govern∣ment, thinks it self obliged to

wait upon you, before it dares venture one step further into the world. Its dress I freely own is mean; Nevertheless since the designe of it is no other than to shew, that true Phi∣losophy doth not contradict the Scriptures, I am inclined to hope it will find a favoura∣ble acceptance among such as have any Concern or Zeal for the advancement of the one, or the security of the other.
The Principles on which I have grounded my Arguments in the following discourse be∣ing Mathematical, it doth more peculiarly belong to You, whose prudence in so Industri∣ously

promoting the Mathe∣matical Sciences, both by your Direction and Encouragement I cannot sufficiently Commend, when I consider what vast im∣provements have been made, and how many Errors of for∣mer Philosophers have been detected by applying Geometry to Natural Philosophy.
I am sensible Sir, how un∣pleasing it would be if I should Address my self to You in the usual stile of Dedications. A prudent Zeal for the Autho∣rity of Scriptures, an Hearty Concern for the Rights of the Church, a Tender Care and Unwearied Industry in Pro∣moting

the Discipline, Learn∣ing, and Interest of an Anti∣ent Society, are Virtues which oblige the World to pay You those Praises, which your Modesty will not suffer you to receive. We who live under the Advantages of these Ex∣cellent Qualifications in a Go∣vernour, cannot but be sensi∣ble of the Obligations we have to be thankful for them; and indeed the desire of Expressing my Gratitude, for these Com∣mon and many other Particu∣lar Favours You have been pleased to bestow on me, was the great motive of my pre∣suming to Inscribe this Dis∣course

to your Name; which I desire may be accepted as the result of Duty and Grati∣tude from,
WORTHY SIR,
