My Lord!
WHEN first I attended your Lordship, about preparing of an Act, against the Tran∣sporting of Gold, your Lord∣ship was pleased to take no∣tice of mee; and that you had heard of my Imprisonment in the Tower, you comman∣ded mee to use my uttermost endeavors, to serv the Common-wealth, that so I might give a clear testimonie both to your Lordship and the State, of my good affection to the pre∣sent Government; and by that means, the State might bee induced to consider my con∣dition, and that my business might bee exami∣ned in Parlament, and I have Justice, by re∣storing mee to my Estate again.

In humble pursuance of your Honor's com∣mands, I did print several Placarts and Ordi∣nances of France, Holland, and Flanders, con∣cerning the regulating of their Monie, Bullion, and Mints, and breviated the Laws and Pro∣clamations heretofore made in England against Transporting of Treasure. And made several arguments upon the whole matter, how high∣ly it did concern this Common-wealth, speedi∣ly to give a stop to the Transporters of Gold and Silver, and several other abuses practised upon the Coin and Bullion of this Common∣wealth. And I did humbly present one of the Books to your Honor, and had your Honor's approbation for the speedie passing of the Act, which your Honor, and the Right Honorable the Council of State, had recommended to the Parlament; but as yet, through the industrie of som guiltie men, this Law, which so highly concern's the safetie, and welfare of the Nati∣on, is not passed the Parlament. And if it were dispatched, it would restore your Mint, to it's flourishing condition, by removing all obstructions in the Mint. And then the settling the valua∣tion of all Coins in Christendom, and the Parr of the Exchange, between us and them, in a∣ny part of Christendom, I would see should bee finished, and the mysteries of Exchange opened, to the high advantage of the Mer∣chants
 of this Nation, who are now generally ignorant of this mysterie, and are as far to seek of these Sciences, as two hundred year ago, the passage to the West-Indies, was to Christen∣dom. The reason is, in England wee have none but our own Monie run's in currant paiment, & our Merchants are generally ignorant of the true value and fineness of Forrain Coins, and what proportion all Forrain Coins hold be∣tween us and them, and the just weights and fineness all Forrain Coins ought to hold, and beeing all weightie according to their just stan∣derd, what they will make the Merchant to coin them into our Monie within the Tower of London; and this is the Parr I humbly intend, and petition your Honor for the speedie dis∣patch. These things are no secrets to the Dutch Merchants, and other Merchant-Strangers here, and that make's them so out-wit the Mer∣chants of our Nation, upon the Exchanges of Monie to any part of Christendom.
My Lord! I humbly again address my self to your Lordship, with som prime Observati∣ons for Trade, which may highly concern the Common-wealth; and it hath been no small comfort to mee, that both your Honor, and many other Honorable Gentlemen of the Coun∣cil of State, upon the reading of them in Ma∣nuscript, do approv of what I have don in this particular, and that you will speedily put
 it in practice for the good of this Nation.
My Lord! I have obeyed your commands for the putting in an Index to what I have said, that so you may contract what is by mee humbly desired. The whole drift of what is de∣sired, is the equal inriching of the Nation in gene∣ral, the repairing and inhabiting all our Sea-Port-Towns, and Harbors, the bringing in a Nurserie of rich Merchants into our Land, the increas of Manufacturie, the increas of Shipping, the set∣ting of all our poor awork, the making England the Mistress and Empross of the Sea, in beeing a Bul∣wark and Protection to her Friends, by spreading out her arms to give shelter in all weathers, both for Merchant-men, and Men of War, in all her Havens and Harbors, both to shelter them from storms, and to furnish them with all man∣ner of Ammunition, Victuals and Merchan∣dize, for all parts of the world, and to bee the Magazin for the world, for all wealth and Trade. For as the World is Ring, so Eng∣land is the Diamond of that Ring; and the wealth, strength, and valor of this Nation, was never so well known to all our neighbors, as under the government of a Common-wealth, as it is now settled, and a few years will shew to the world. This I say to bee true, so visibly, that the poorest Commoner in this Nation, will finde there is as much difference between the situation of England and Holland to bring
 and contract the Trade of the world, as there is in proportion, difference between an ounce Troie, and a pound weight Troie; for they in Holland, have not six points of the Compass, to have winde to go in and out, and all dange∣rous Seas, and in som of them, as at the Tex∣el, fortie sail of ships are cast away in a year. But behold, England hang's in the Sea, like an O∣riental Pearl at a fair Ladie's ear, no winde can blow at any point of the Compass, but ships may both go in and com out of her Harbors. And I believ, a Free Trade will treble the Importation, and Exportation of goods into all the Sea-Ports of this Nation, besides the emploiment of the shipping of the Nation. And as wee are a shield and protection to our friends, by putting in exe∣cution these Observations, you will reduce the rebellious Sea-men of our own Nation, have an accompt of their wives and children, in what service they are, and where against the State; and by this means, if not out of obe∣dience and love to the present Government, yet out of an affection to their wives and children, and to save their estates, you shall have them return to their obedience; for when their wives are sequestred in England, it will bee a grea∣ter Load-stone, then your Men of War you send out, to reduce them, and this business re∣quire's a diligent and able man, to give the State an Accompt from time to time, and if it
 bee effectually followed, will bring home most of our Sea-men to their obedience, a business of the highest consequence both to reduce them, with the least change of bloud and monie.
Then the examination of the carriage of se∣veral Companies, for the private enriching of a few, is humbly presented to the Council of State, and the Council for Trade, that so the abuses for the times past, may bee found out and punished, and such Rules and Regulati∣ons for the future, may bee made as shall bee most conducing to the benefit of the Com∣mon-wealth in general, without any private regard to private persons. My Lord! this ar∣gument which I have undertaken, concern's the corrupt interest of many men, who will storm to see these things laid open to the world, and I shall bee sure to bee stung with the venom of som of their tongues; Therefore I am an hum∣ble suitor to your Honor and the Council of State, for your Honor's protection and coun∣tenance of these my weak endevors for the service of this Nation, which noble favor shall for ever oblige mee to praie for your Honor's happiness and prosperitie. God continue your Honor in all prosperitie in this world, and in the world to com; and this shall bee the praier of
