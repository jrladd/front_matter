RIght Honorable; If it ap∣peare presumption in me to shew my love, my du∣tie betraies me to it. The advantage I have gleaned from idle houres, in ex∣changing this Indian Hi∣story from Spanish to En∣glish, is commended to your Honors Patronage, whose first father Ioseph Acosta, hath with great observation made worthie the over-looking. A greater motive then that you are your selfe, needed not to excite me to this dedication. I beseech you my good Lord, take it into shelter, and receive that which is not, for that which I would it were. Let my insufficiencie be measured by my good will. So shall my poore abilities thrive vnder your in∣couragement, and happily leade me on to some stron∣ger vndertaking; wherein I shall bee bound to thanke you for mine owne paines, and for ever remaine
