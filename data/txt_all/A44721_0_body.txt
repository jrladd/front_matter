MY LORD,
MY brain was a good while in labor be∣fore it could produce a Resolution, to whom of those Noble Personages I have the honor to wait upon som∣times I shold most properly addresse this Piece in point of Dedication: At last, my thoughts reflecting upon your Lordship, did there acquiesce and settle. Nor, I beleeve, will any knowing Soul question my judgment in this Election, considering how excellently your Lordship is versd in the Customes, Conditions and Languages of divers Nations, which is the scope and subject of these Criticall Orations, though running in a new untrodden way.
Moreover, the Orators here being Princes, and No∣blemen, wherof those of Germany are esteemd to be of the

ancientst Extraction and purest Allaye of any in Eu∣rope, being those who yet retain their first integrity as Machiavill confesseth, I say, the Orators here being all Peers, I thought it not incongruous to present their Con∣ceptions to a Personage of their own rank, that Patronus might be par Operi.
Lastly, the main design of this application to your Lordship was to divulge my gratitude for the frequent noble respects I receave within your walls, that not only the present times may bear witnes, but future Ages may find it allso upon Record (in this small Monument) how much I am (and was)
