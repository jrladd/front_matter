May it please your Lordship,
MY vast Obligations to your Lordship's Good∣ness

exceeding all possibility of Retaliation, and a private Ac∣knowledgment being too faint a Testimony of the Gratitude of my Mind, I have presum'd on this Method to make my Thankfulness extend beyond the Limits of my Life, and acquaint the World that His Majesty's Bounty, and your Lordship's Favours, have not been thrown away upon an Ungrateful Person, but be∣stow'd upon a Dutiful Subject, who hath hitherto, and as long as God affords him Life, will express his Duty to your Lord∣ship, in the Sincerity of his Ser∣vice to His Majesty's Govern∣ment; and that I know will be more acceptable to your Lordship, than tedious Ha∣rangues, or elegant Expres∣sions; where the greatest I can

make, is the least that I ac∣knowledge to be due to your Lordship from me.
The following Discourse, my Lord, shews the Lawful∣ness of our late happy Revolu∣tion, and might justly com∣mand my Obliging the World with an Account of your Lord∣ship's extraordinary Merits, in that, and all other Occasions, for England's Safety; But when I consider your Lordship is better pleas'd in deserving, than hearing an excellent Character, and that your Lordship being one of those Pillars that under His Sacred Majesty support the Weight of Publick Transacti∣ons, I cannot hope the Great Affairs of your Eminent Sta∣tion should afford you Time to Read a longer Dedication, and therefore dare not give my

self the Liberty of writing so much as a short Elogy upon a Subject that is able to ju∣stifie the largest Panegyrick. Now,
That your Lordship may enjoy a long and happy Life, exalted in your Prince's Fa∣vour, and prosperous in all your Negotiations, to the En∣couragement of true Piety, Loyalty, and Vertue, shall be the Incessant Prayers of,
My Lord,
