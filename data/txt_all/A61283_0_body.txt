MADAM,
I Know not what excuse to make for offering so poor a Present to your Ladiship, and (under your Name) to the World. My performance must needs make it mean, though the Design is Great; it being a familiar Introduction to the understanding of the New Testament. But when I consider what a Misfortune in your Education did cast you
into a Religion, that can never hope to support it self but by Ignorance of the Scriptures, from which your Ladiship is now so happily deli∣vered, through the assistance of that Eminent and Worthy Dean of Canterbury, to the Great Joy of your most Illustrious Brother the ever Renowned DUKE of Monmouth, his Grace; and to the Infinite satisfaction of your Hus∣band, who never thought him∣self completely Happy in you, till Religion had united your Souls, as well as Wedlock had done your Persons. When I reflect on these things, I hope that (without accusing you) I may fear that (till of late) you have been too much a Stranger to those Holy Writings, or rather, they have been to you as a Sealed Book. And at the same time I may assure
my self, that being brought into that Church which hath no other Rule or Standard of Faith but the Holy Scriptures, you will now Redeem the time of your Former Ignorance, by a stricter Applica∣tion to that blessed Study, and therefore will not despise the meanest help which can be offered to you. I now present your Ladiship with my Endeavours about the New Testament, and hope shortly to give you an account of what I have already finished concerning the Old. I have so perfect an assurance of your Ladiships Goodness, that I am confident you will easily par∣don this Presumption, and accept of my Faithful Zeal, and Hearty Prayers to God, to bestow upon you all those Blessings, which either your High Blood, or more
excellent Qualities may render you Capable of: and that you will permit me to assume the Honour, with the hearty wish of this, and many prosperous New Years, to own my self,
MADAM,
Jan. 1. 1679/80.
