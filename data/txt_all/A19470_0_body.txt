AS the most noble Mae∣cenas of all good Arts, & the most worthy Pa¦tron of all such as can any way merit of their Countrey: I haue elected you (Right Honourable Lord) to whom I haue presumed (encouraged by your known grace and Clemency) to Dedicate these

my tedious and dangerous Trauels. In which, your Honour shall finde vn∣doubtedly all truth, and some nouelty. If after your more weighty and serious Considerations, you will daine the perusall of this my rude and vnpolisht discourse. For being shipwrackt in Cambaya, the farthest part of the East Indies, and not dispairing in the power of the Almighty, of my safe re∣turne to my Countrey. Leauing the rest, to the number of 75. that would not hazard so desperate and vnex∣pected an vndertaking. I aduentured to passe thorow many vnknown King∣domes and Cities ouer Land: of all which, I haue (to my plain vnderstan∣ding) made a particular and aithfull discouery: Protesting to your Ho∣nor that in all my trauels and (almost

incredible dangers) I haue heere ex∣prest no more then I haue directly seen, and to my great sufferance and diffi∣cultie prooued. Pardon, I intreat your Lordship, this my presumption, in se∣lecting you the noble and worthy Pa∣tron, to so rude a discourse, whose sim∣plenesse is onely excused in the Truth. That granted, I shall thinke my selfe most comforted after al my precedent Hazards, that your Honor will but daine to accept of this report.
