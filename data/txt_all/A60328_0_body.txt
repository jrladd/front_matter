RIGHT HONORABLE,
I being a person who (without vanity) may say,

that Heaven hath blessed with so much of a Publick Spirit, that I feel in my heart an inclination that would do good unto all men; but since my ability quadrats not with my desires, (that being GODS peculiar Priviledge, whose Om∣nipotencie can onely equall his Will,) I must rest satisfied with the extent of my Cordiall Good Wishes for the Wellfare of all: from which Principle, (though I am not in a capacity to act,) I could not forbear to express some∣things in these Memorialls, where∣by I humbly conceive, the Good and Wellfare of the Burrows of this Kingdom may in some measure be advanced, if acceptably im∣proven.
It would be from a defect of Cha∣rity,

if any apprehend I have wrot these out of conceit of my own abi∣litie, for I am not so fond of any Ta∣lent I have acquyred, that if my ear∣nestness to cast in my Mite into the Treasurie for the Publick Good, had not overballanced the mean thoughts I have of any thing I can do of this nature, I should never have dared to present you with them. But now here they be, and such as they are I presume to lay before You, who are the Represen∣tatives of the Chiefest City of this Nation. It is your Discretion, your Zeall for the Publick-Good, your Christian Wisdom and Beha∣viour, your Righteousness and Pie∣ty, that influences not only the rest of the Burrows, but also most of the Subjects of this Kingdom. I am

not ignorant how much I expose my self to the Critick Censures of many, in permitting the Publish∣ing of this Tractat, considering the Politness and Learning of this Age, and my own Imperfections in undertaking such a Task: Yet if ye shall be pleased favourably to accept hereof, Charitably con∣structing my Zeal, and covering my Defects and Over-reachings, I need care the less what thoughts others have of me or it. And be∣cause it is frequent with many, to measure their Esteem of Books by the respect or disrespect that is had to the Author, I have therefore suppressed my Name, that it may neither be undervalued, or pos∣sibly by some overvalued upon my account: but that all may be left

to consider what is said, then to enquyre who said so. And how ever it be, it shall be the cry of my heart, that ye may acquit Your selves in all Your Places and Ad∣ministrations like Men and Chris∣tians, and that with Jehoshaphat Ye may prepare Your Hearts to seek the LORD. To whose Wis∣dom, Counsell and Direction, I commend You all, as becomes
Right Honorable
