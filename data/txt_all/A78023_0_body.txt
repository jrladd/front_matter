SIRS,
THat I, of so small acquaintance with you, yet to you all not altogether unknown, should present you with any such service as this, though it may seem to some too much pre∣sumption, yet not to any (I hope) either ar∣rogancy, or importunate impertinency at this time, as being not unseasonable for Truth, at least to the wise, no not in this so idolized adulatory Age, which as, a mel dew hath so much blasted both our blossoms with blacknesse, and our fruit with barrennesse.

And for the truth of what is here brought unto you, and how far, or how neer, or how truely it concern∣eth you all in the application, I leave to your maturest and most Christian wisdom to judge.

Ezek. 3.17. to 21. freed mine own soul. Nor durst I forbear this duty at this time in a matter of so high importance, if well weighed, as wherein the weal or we of this Body, in refe∣rence to the righteous Judge of all, is so much concerned.
Consider what is said, and the Lord give you understanding in all things: Which is the humble and earnest Prayer of
