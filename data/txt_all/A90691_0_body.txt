IF I know my own heart, there were two Reasons prevailed with me for sending forth this Treatise into the light; First, to witnesse what the Lord (to the praise of his abundant grace) hath done for my own poor soul. Secondly, As drawn forth by tender affections and yern∣ing bowels, I desire more and more to put on for your immortall souls, which my hearts desire is should be as dear and pretious to me as my own, yea, that my heart might be en∣flamed with that zeal of holy Paul, Rom. 11.14. If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are of my flesh, and might save some of them. In this brief Treatise (though chiefly pointing at the comforting a disquieted spirit) yet there is laid down in the former part of it what
may suit with your severall conditions, and so to set up a rest lesse enquiry in your spirits after the Lord Jesus, till he shall fill your souls with this blessed calm of his own pre∣sence here shadowed forth unto you: If it should be objected by any other, that I might have directed you to other Books before ex∣tant (of which blessed be God there's abun∣dant choice;) I answer, and I verily be∣leeve will you with me, that the room I have in your affections will render something from my self (though far short of the excellencies of other Pieces) more gratefull to you, and that you will be the more inclined to reade it; Ʋpon which account I send it to you, with my breathings to heaven for the bles∣sing of the Spirit of grace to be with it; and all others to whose hands it shall come, cra∣ving a candid interpretation with them: I Rest,

Bourton on the Water, Sept. 21. 1652.
