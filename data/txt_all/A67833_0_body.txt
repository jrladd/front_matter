Dear Nephew,
THE Obligation was so natural for me to be Your Preacher, that my declining the Office would have look'd like want of Affection; and this was the Reason why I did not decline it, as otherwise I should have done, in re∣gard of that great Indisposition of Body which has of late afflicted me. It is the Wisdom of those that are Well, but the Necessity of the Sick, to think upon Awful things; And at the time when You came to bespeak me for Your Service, a Thought of that sort was lying upon my mind, which I found apposite to determine my Subject: That Thought I pursued into the Sermon which I now Publish; and the more willingly, because part of its Matter seems to me to come too little into pub∣lick Consideration; although there are not many Things we can consider, that are of greater mo∣ment to Christian Living. Let me deal familiarly with You, and desire You to make Your self Judge

in the case; Peruse this Sermon sometimes at a retired hour, and contemplate the naked Argu∣ment, which is purely Scriptural (for I would not be interpreted to recommend any thing in it that is Mine,) and tell me whether You do not find it well conducing to the great End You aim at; which is (I know) to be a Good Man, and to finish those Commendable Respects which You bear to Your King, Church, and Country, with a just and proper Sense of God: To whose Blessing I heartily recommend You, and rest
Your Affectionate and Humble Servant
