TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE VVILLIAM, Lord CAVENDISH, Baron of Hardwicke, All grace and Happinesse.
RIght Noble Lord, your fa∣vourable ap∣probation of my School-in∣deavouvs, to∣gether with your honora∣ble bounty, for the incouraging of me, to the accomplishment of my promise for my Grammaticall




translations, have imboldned me to dedicate this little labour unto your Lordship. And so much the rather, for that I hope, it being u∣sed aright, according to the dire∣ctions given in my booke called Ludus Literarius, or the Grammar-schoole, shall give a full demon∣stration of whatsoever I have writ∣ten therein, concerning the com∣modity of such like translations (so farre as the matter hereof doth extend it selfe) to make the way to the Latine tongue, most easie and full of all pleasant allurement, when once the common grounds of the Accedence are gotten, with a perfect readines in the examples of the Nounes and Verbes, which may soone be effected, by the help in the Posing of the Accedence and Grammar. So as the benefit of these may not only redound un∣to our common Country-schools,




but happily (and as I unfainedly wish) unto many in all places, who either having had but some little smattering in Latin, or having lost that which they had therein, are desirous to repaire the same. And more specially to our debauched youth, to helpe to retire some of them, to the sweete and pleasant delights, which are to be found in good studies, & the best autors, from their disordered courses, wherein they so generally and wholly runne themselves out of all; mispending their talents, both time and patrimony, to their utter perdition, in all kinde of strange riot, and outragious excesse; with∣out any further consideration, ei∣ther of the end why they were borne, or wherefore those prei∣ous talents of time, wit, and good ability, were cōmitted unto them: or so much as of that dreadfull ac∣count,




which they must every one give up for the same: never be∣thinking thēselves, that the Lord hath not put this price into their hands, to be so consumed in spen∣ding dayes, nights, and yeares, yea their whole lives, in drinking, ga∣ming, swearing, revelling, and all manner of outrage, worse then e∣ver did the Heathen; but to be o∣therwise imployed, even to buy wisedome,Pro. 16.17. as Salomon doth tell them; to the advancing and per∣petuall upholding of his true Re∣ligion and service, every one for his ability, by himselfe and all o∣thers; to have wherewith not one∣ly to maintaine, but also to better their estate, with all those who do depend vpon them. And so gene∣rally to the performance of every holy duty, which hee requires at all our hands; yea to live in such imployment, as may most ted to




the adorning of our holy professi∣on of the glorious Gospell of Ie∣sus Christ, and the comfort of our owne soules, with the good of all others. Thus undoubtedly must our accounts bee made: and to whom more hath beene commit∣ted, must more bee looked for at their hands. Wherefore proceed (most worthy Lord) in this your noble care, to further for your part all those good meanes by which the Church of God may ever pro∣sper, and all good learning and vertue (the chiefe pillars and or∣naments both of Church and Common-wealth) may flourish more and more. That your selfe, with your noble progeny, may be blessed in the earth, and you (ever ready to give up a happy account of your stuardship) to be taken up into everlasting habitation, to live in blisse eternally: Whereunto I




shall ever strive for you, and to ac∣complish my service thus entred into for the common good of the present and all succeeding gene∣rations. And so in all humble thankfulnesse taking my leave, I commend your Lo▪ with your most vertuous Lady, and all your Noble familie, to his heavenly Grace, to perfect that good work, which he hath begunne, and rest
