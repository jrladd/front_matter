AFter some ad∣uising with my selfe, in whose name I should publish this litle worke, your Maiestie (my most dread So∣ueraigne) aboue all others came first into my mind, for that you may iustly challenge as your owne right, the first fruites of my labours, of what kinde soeuer they be. Hauing then heretofore consecrated the first fruites of

the first kind of my writings vnto your Highnes: I thought it meete also, that this second kinde of meditations (in the com∣mon places of diuinitie) should be pre∣sented to the same your Maiestie. From this purpose although many things feared me, among which your princely Maiestie (to speak as the truth is) adorned with rare knowledge of diuine things, did most oc∣cupie my minde: your Maiestie, I say the greatnes whereof, my owne meannes, and the slendernes of this work, were not able to endure. Yet when I recounted with my selfe how great your curtesie and gentle∣nes was alwaies accustomed to bee to∣wards all men, but especially towards my selfe; I determined rather to incurre some suspition of ouermuch boldnes, then not to giue testimonie of my dutie, and of my most humble deuotion towards your Ma∣iestie, euen by the dedication of this small worke of mine how meane soeuer it be. Respect therefore (most noble King) not so much this smal worke, as the testimonie of a mind most dutifully affected towards your Maiestie in the Lord, and as my dutie

requireth, most readie according to my small abilitie, with all lowlines to do your Maiestie most humble seruice in any thing that I can during life. But what is there wherein I can do your Maiestie better ser∣uice then in striuing with my God, with continuall & earnest prayers, that through his grace and singular goodnes you may for euer maintaine, continue, and make good that excellent opinion which you haue (not vndeseruedly) alreadie gotten, in forraine nations amongst such men, as are most eminent in this our age, both for learning and godlines: that so you may haue a happie raigne in this present life, and in that other life may be a fellow heire of that heauenly kingdome: in compari∣son of the glorie of which kingdome) that I may speake this by the way) I my selfe a good while since, haue heard you despise al these earthly kingdoms, at such time as amongst other matters, in a certain fami∣liar conference, where there were but a fewe present, you discoursed of many things learnedly (I speake the truth to the glorie of God, without any flatterie) and

godlily, and delightfully, concerning Christ, and of praying to him onely, and not to Angels, or Saints departed out of this life) you may, I say, be a fellow heire together with your head, euen that most high King, Lord, and heire of all things Iesus Christ, whose grace, mercie and po∣wer defend and protect you both in bodie and soule, from all your e∣nemies, bodily and ghostly for euermore.
