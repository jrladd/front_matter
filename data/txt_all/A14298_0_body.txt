MADAME, it hath euer beene
a customary fashion among
Students, to chuse out some
noble Personage, eminent for
vertue, vnder the glory of whose name,
their Bookes might walke vp and downe
on the worlds Theater, secured from that
spitefull Spirit of Detraction, whose



blustering blasts of Blasphemie, I lately en∣deuoured
to coniure and conuict. After the
like manner, to be somwhat in the fashion,
loe here I submit before your eyes of Grace
this saplesse Worke of mine, that the starry
influence of your auncient loue may reflect
vpon the darkest parts therof, where per∣haps
the distance of Climate with-holds
your directest beames. I know your Lady∣ship
is stored with far more precious pre∣sents:
onely Dutie herein seemes to free
me from Presumption, in dedicating the
blossomes of my youthfull Studies to One,
who is as wise as I am mindfull, as fa∣uourable
as I am faithfull, and euer will
continue
