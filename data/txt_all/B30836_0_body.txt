MY LORD,
IT having pleased his Serene Majesty, our most Gracious Soveraign in all places to manifest his Royal care of his happy Subjects; even the most remote in the West Indies, living on the daily refreshings thereof: Distances separating nothing from
his extensive goodness, but rather evidencing the bounty of the over∣flowing Source; through the sig∣nal eminency of the Noble Convey∣ance his Majesty was pleased to make of himself to the Island of Jamaica, in your Lordships most happy Government thereof: It cannot but deeply impress the high∣est obligations of grateful Loyalty on all, who savour so great a good∣ness, among whom my education and business, but more especially my favourable accesses to your Ex∣cellency, hath made me one, though the least, yet such who necessarily must testifie my sence of the Pub∣lick
Weal, by offering my small Mite thereto. Having the great encouragement of your Lordships Patronage, to assist the weakness of my Endeavours; the which since they are in my own way, at least as an observer and well wish∣er to health and life; it may seem not improper for me, to remark in a new Colony, as Jamaica is, the Conducers thereto, and to transfer such to a further cultivation; that the English or others may not miss of their ends in transporting them∣selves thither, nor his Majesty of his Subjects by too immature deaths. My Lord, the sincerity
of my ends my Conscience must ju∣stifie, not by blind Zeal and empty Words, but matter of Fact in desi∣red successes, of which your Lord∣ship being the most competent Judge, I presume to lay my follow∣ing discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica at your Lordships Feet, humbly begging pardon for my weakness therein, and the Honour of being owned as, My Lord,

At Port-Royal in Jamaica.
