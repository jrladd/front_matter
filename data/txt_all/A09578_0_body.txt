RIGHT REVEREND,
AFter much paines taken in the study and art of Musicke, for these many yeares last past, to compose Canons of two & three parts in one upon the Plain-song; have now at length laid downe this burden of my minde, the hopefull issue of my tyred braine. To the visiting of which Infant, many of my good friends resorting, and those skilfull in my profession, perswa∣ded me to expose it to the world, and let try for it selfe; which I refused to doe, untill I called to minde, that it might tend to the praise and glory of Almighty God, and to the benefit of my native country: Yet finding, that such exposed Infants might easily perish without the protection of some worthy and powerfull Patron, resolved to keepe it at home, untill I remembred your good Lordship to be a lover and favourer of Musick, and unto whom I have beene much bound for many favours, for all which, being not able to returne wor∣thy compensation, but rather to trench more and more

daily upon your benignity, doe bequeath this my In∣fant unto your Lordships Patronage, whom I know for authority, wisedome, and learning to be able, and for piety and charity will bee willing, to protect the same; which if you vouchsafe, you have and alwayes shall have devoted
To your Lordships service,
