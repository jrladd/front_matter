SIR,
THo' a Present of Fables to Your Excellency the immitable Author of the Country-Mouse, and City-Mouse, may at this time seem improper: Yet a Present of Loyalty to the same Go∣vernment, which You have been so studi∣ous and successful in the Preservation of, can∣not but carry its Acceptance with it. That Liberty which Your Excellency gave the World so sweet a taste of in Your most incom∣parable Fable, and which afterwards You was so instrumental in continuing to us, is
 in part the Subject of these. And as Ae∣sop at Tunbridge, by feign'd and surrepti∣tious Fables, seems to bewail the change of the late Government, so Aesop at Epsom with real and genuine resoyceth at the Es∣tablishment of this. Sir, Your Execellency's great Example has such a prevailing in∣fluence, as to make the meanest Subject soli∣citous for the Publick Good, and to see that Revolution become the subject of Satyr, which has giv'n such opportunities for Hene∣gyrick, (and whose Royal Author has had such immortal Commendations from Your Excellency's the best of Pens) could not but add very much to my Resentments in the following Papers. But, Sir, to give no further interruption to a Gentleman whose very Leisure is employ'd for the pub∣lick Safety, I shall not encroach upon Your time any further than to beg Your Acceptance of this poor Entertainment, which, shall make me add to my Endeavours of appoving my self in a more substantial way,
Sir,
