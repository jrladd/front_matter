Most Gracious Soveraign,
ALthough I know how little leisure Great Kings have to read large Books, or indeed any, save onely Gods, (the study, belief and obedience of which, is precisely com∣manded, even to Kings, Deut. 17.18,19. And from which, whatever wholly diverts them, will hazard to damn them; there being no affairs of so great importance, as their serving God, and saving their own Souls; nor any Precepts so wise, just, holy, and safe, as those of the Divine Oracles; nor any Em∣pire so glorious, as that by which Kings being subject to Gods Law, have dominion over themselves, and so best deserve and exercise it over their Subjects.)
Yet having lived to see the wonderful and happy Restau∣ration of Your Majesty to Your Rightful Kingdoms, and of this Reformed Church to its just Rights, Primitive Order, and Pristine Constitution, by Your Majesties prudent care, and imparallel'd bounty, I know not what to present more wor∣thy of Your Majesties acceptance, and my duty, then these Elaborate and Seasonable Works of the Famous and Pru∣dent Mr. Richard Hooker, now augmented, and I hope compleated with the Three last Books, so much desired, and so long concealed.
The publishing of which Volume so intire, and thus pre∣senting it to Your Majesty, seems to be a blessing and honor reserved by Gods Providence, to add a further lusture to

Your Majesties glorious Name, and happy Reign, whose transcendent favor, justice, merit, and munificence to the long afflicted Church of England, is a subject no less worthy of admirasion then gratitude to all Posterity. And of all things (next Gods grace) not to be abused or turned into wantonness by any of Your Majesties Clergy, who are highly obliged be∣yond all other Subjects to Piety, Loyalty, and Industry.
I shall need nothing more to ingratiate this incomparable Piece to Your Majesties acceptance, and all the English Worlds, then those high commendations it hath ever had, as from all prudent, peaceable, and impartial Readers, so espe∣cially from Your Majesties Royal Father, who a few days be∣fore he was Crowned with Martyrdom, commended to His dearest Children, the diligent Reading of Mr. Hookers Ecclesiastical Polity, even next the Bible; as an excellent means to settle them in the Truth of Religion, and in the Peace of this Church, as much Christian, and as well Re∣formed as any under Heaven: As if God had reserved this signal Honor to be done by the best of Kings, and greatest Sufferers for this Church, to Him who was one of the best Writers, and ablest Defenders of it.
To this Compleated Edition, is added such particular ac∣counts as could be got of the Authors Person, Education, Temper, Manners, Fortunes, Life, and Death, which is now done with much exactness and proportion: That hereby Your Majesty, and all the World, may see what sort of Men are fittest for Church-work (which like the Build∣ing of Solomons Temple, is best carried on with most evenness of Iudgement, and least noise of Passion.) Also what manner of Man he was, to whom we all ow this Noble Work, and durable Defence.
Which is indeed at once (as the Tongues of Eloquent Prin∣ces are to themselves, and their Subjects) both a Treasury and an Armory, to inrich their friends, and defend them against the Enemies of the Church of England: Arare composition of unpassionate Reason, and unpartial Religion; the mature product of a Indicious Scholar, a Loyal Subject, an Humble

Preacher, and a most Eloquent Writer: The very abstract and quintessence of Laws Humane and Divine; a Summary of the Grounds, Rules, and Proportions of true Polity in Church and State: Vpon which clear, solid and safe Foun∣dations, the good Order, Peace, and Government of this Church was anciently setled, and on which, while it stands firm, it will be flourishing. All other popular and specious pretensions being found by late sad experiences, to be as novel and unfit, so factious and fallacious, yea, dangerous and de∣structive to the Peace and Prosperity of this Church and Kingdom, whose inseparable happiness and interests are bound up in Monarchy and Episcopacy.
The Politick and Visible managing of both which, God hath now graciously restored and committed to Your Majesties Soveraign Wisdom and Authority, after the many and long Tragedies suffered from those Club Masters and Tub-Ministers, who sought not fairly to obtain Reformation of what might seem amiss, but violently and wholly to overthrow the ancient and goodly Fabrick of this Church and Kingdom. For finding themselves not able in many years to Answer this one Book, long ago written in defence of the Truth, Order, Government, Authority, and Liberty (in things indifferent) of this Reformed Church, agreeable to Right Reason, and True Religion (which makes this well tempered Peice, a File capable to break the Teeth of any that venture to bite it;) they conspired at last to betake themselves to Arms, to kindle those horrid fires of Civil Wars, which this wise Author foresaw, and foretold in his admirable Preface, would follow those sparks, and that smoak which he saw rise in his days: So that from impertinent Disputes (seconded with scurrilous Pamphlets) they fled to Tumults, Sedition, Rebellion, Sacriledge, Parri∣cide, yea, Regicide; Counsels Weapons, and Practices, certainly, no way becoming the hearts and hands of Christian Subjects, nor ever sanctified by Christ for his Service, or his Churches good.
What now remains, but Your Majesties perfecting and preserving that (in this Church) which you have with much

prudence and tenderness, so happily begun and prosecuted, with more zeal then the establishment of Your own Throne. The still crazy Church of England, together with this Book (its great and impregnable Shield) do further need, and humbly implore Your Majesties Royal Protection under God: Nor can Your Majesty by any generous instance and perseverance (most worthy of a Christian King) more express that pious and grateful sense which God and all good Men expect from Your Majesty, as some retribution for his many miraculous mercies to Your Self, then in a wise, speedy, and happy setling of our Religious peace, with the least grievance, and most satisfacti∣on to all Your good Subjects; Sacred Order and Uniformi∣ty being the centre and circumference of our Civil Tran∣quillity: Sedition naturally rising out of Schism, and Rebel∣lion out of Faction; The onely cure and antidote against both, are good Laws and Canons, first wisely made, with all Chri∣stian Moderation, and Seasonable Charity; next, duly exe∣cuted with Iustice and Impartiality; which sober Severity, is indeed the greatest Charity to the Publique. Whose Verity, Vnity, Sanctity and Solemnity in Religious Concernments, be∣ing once duly established, must not be shaken or sacrificed to any private varieties and extravagancies. Where the inter∣nals of Doctrines, Morality, Mysteries, and Evangelical Du∣ties, being (as they are in the Church of England) sound and sacred, the externals of decent Forms, Circumstances, Rites and Ceremonies, being subordinate and servient to the main, cannot be either evil or unsafe, neither offensive to God nor good Christians.
For the attaining of which blessed ends of Piety and Peace, that the sacred Sun and Shield of the Divine Grace and Power directing and protecting, may ever shine upon Your Majesties Person and Family, Counsels and Power, is the humble Prayer of
