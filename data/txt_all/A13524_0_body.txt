GEntlemen and Yeomen, mar∣uell
not that I writ this Pamphlet
in Prose now, hauing before times
set forth so many Bookes in verse;
The First Reason that mooued me to write
thus, was because I was Lame, and durst
not write Verses for feare they should be in∣fected
with my Griefe, & be lame too. The
Second Reason is, because that I finde no
good rime for a Coach but Broach, Roach
Encroach, or such like: And you knowe
that the Coach hath ouer-throwne the good

vse of the Broach & Broch-turner, turning
the one to Rackes and the other to Iackes,
quite through the Kingdome: The Roach
is a drie Fish, much like the vnprofitable
profit of a Coach: It will cost more the dres∣sing
and Appurtnances then 'tis worth: For
the word Encroach I thinke that best befits
it, for I think neuer such an impudent, prowd
sawcie Intruder or Encroacher came into
the world as a Coach is: for it hath driuen
many honest Families out of their Houses,
many Knights to Beggers, Corporations to
pouerty, Almes deedes to all misdeedes, Hos∣pitality
to extortion, Plenty to famine, Hu∣mility
to pride, Compassion to oppression, and
all Earthly goodnes almost to an vtter con∣fusion.
These haue beene the causes why I writ
this Booke in Prose, and Dedicated it to all
your good Companies, knowing that you
haue borne a heauy share in the Calamitie
which these hyred Hackney hell-Carts haue

put this Common-wealth vnto: For in all
my whole Discourse, I doe not enueigh a∣gainst
any Coaches that belong to Persons
of worth or qualitie, but onely against the
Catterpiller swarme of hyrelings; they haue
vndone my poore Trade, whereof I am a
Member, and though I looke for no reforma∣tion,
yet I expect the benefit of an old Pro∣uerbe
(Giue the loosers leaue to speake:)
I haue Imbroadered it with mirth, Quilted
it with materiall stuffe, Lac'd it with simi∣litudes;
Sowed it with comparisons, and in
a word, so playd the Taylor with it, that I
thinke it will fitte the wearing of any honest
mans Reading, Attention, and Liking: But
howsoeuer, I leaue both it and my selfe to
remayne
