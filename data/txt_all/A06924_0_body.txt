HOwsoeuer (Right Honourable and most vertuous Ladie) this Booke may come to your Noble Goodnesse clo∣thed in an old Name or Garment, yet doubtlesse (excellent Madam) it is full of many new vertues which will euer admire & serue you; and though it can adde nothing to your owne rare and vnaparalleld knowledge, yet may it to those Noble good ones (which will endeauour any small sparke of your imita∣tion) bring such a light, as may make them shine with a great deale of charity. I doe not assume to my selfe (though I am not altogether ignorant in abilitie to iudge of these things) the full inuention and scope of this whole worke: for it is true (great Ladie) that much of it was a Manuscript which many yeeres agon belonged to an Honourable Countesse, one of the greatest Glo∣ries of our Kingdome, and were the opinions of the

greatest Physitions which then liued; which being now approued by one not inferiour to any of that Profession I was the rather imboldned to send it to your blessed, hand, knowing you to be a Mistresse so full of honorable piety and goodnes, that although this imperfit offer may come vnto you weake and disable, yet your Noble ver∣tue will support it, and make it so strong in the world, that I doubt not but it shall doe seruice to all those which will serue you, whilest my selfe and my poore prayers shall to my last gaspe labour to attend you.
