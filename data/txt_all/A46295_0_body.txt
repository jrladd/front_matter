Honorable Sir,
THIS rare and remarkable Piece of History, as it was Dedicated be∣fore to the City of London in generall, because of the quality of the Subject; Treating of the ruine of one of the most famous Cities upon Earth: So upon this Review, and new Edition, I take the boldness of Dedicating it to You alone; who are one of the Eminent Members,

and Ornament thereof; as also being Governor of that Place, wherein lies her chiefest security.
It was formerly Dedicated to this Ci∣ty, in the highest brunt of the late civill Confusions. And the Noble Author of the following Epistle thought it very seasonable to do so, out of an express design to awaken, and warn Her of her desperate condition at that Time; And it produced so happy effects, that it made such impressions upon the spirits of ma∣ny of the best Citizens, that they began to recollect themselves, and see their Error; The said Author representing unto them, that the same Crimes, and Crying sins, which raigned in Jerusalem before her last and utter destruction, were very rife then in London; which were, the spirit of Sedition, instable and stubborn Rebellious hearts, their mur∣murings at Government, and an itch after Innovations. As also the defiling

of their Temple, the Irreverence and comtempt of the Priests, the violation of the Tombs of the dead, with other acts of Prophaness and Sacriledge; But principally the Crucifying of the Lord of Life.
The City of London was guilty at that time, of all these ugly and enor∣mous Crimes, and may be said to be lead all along by a true Jewish spirit; And concerning the last, viz. the Cru∣cifixion of our Saviour, though no Com∣parison may be made without a high prophaness, yet the manner of murthering CHARLES the first, may be hum∣bly said to bear a kind of analogy, and resemblance with it; Nay the Jews (whereof there are swarms now in this City) will not stick to say, that it was a Murther beyond theirs; for, what they did, they did it out of blindness and ignorance: for they neither knew nor acknowledged Him to be King of

the Jew: But the English did accuse, and arraign, they did condemn, and murther King CHARLES by the name of their own King, the King of England.
God Almighty avert those further judgments which hang over us, as pray∣eth,
Honorable Sir,
