My LORD,
THE last Favours which I receiv'd from you, embolden me to affix on your Lordship this Dedication, and commit these my first Fruits to your Honourable Pro∣tection: For which Presumption I humbly beg your Lordship's Pardon. The Stile I confess is plain and rustick, and anteth that elegancy of Language which a more learned Pen might have dressed it up with.
But the Subject (tho ill clad) is wholly new and sublime, being a Subject never before treated on in this Nature, viz. the Demonstration of Astrology, founded upon the Copernican Hypo∣thesis: And tho but an Embrio, I hope it will live in spite of all its Opposers, especially if it may receive the auspicious Favour of your Lordship's Countenance; then shall I not doubt its Pre∣ferment, and therein the Advancement of the Celestial Scien∣ces, and chiefly this most useful and innocent Part, the Know∣ledg of the Weather.
Wherein I through my diligent Study and Observations, have gained more select Arcana's than ever were known to the late (tho Learned) Dr. Goad, who wrote K. James the Second's Weather.
I confess it unworthiness to stamp the Impression of your Honour's Titles upon such an abortive Embryo; yet could I ima∣gine it would in the future become the least disparagement to the Dignity of the Godfather, I would even now crush it in the Bud, and stop its production, and not suffer it to appear in this wild World, where the Zoilian Sharks stand ready, with their duplicated Teeth, to devour it, if not sheltered under the Shadow of your Honour's Wings, to whose Tuition I only commit it for Protection; humbly imploring your Lordship's favourable Construction of this my Boldness, and it will be an Incouragement to the future Endeavours of,
My LORD,
