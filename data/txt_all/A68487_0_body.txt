IN respecte of the manifolde good turnes, and fa∣uourable deedes of freendship, that not onely I, but others, to whom I am somewhat behol∣ding, haue receiued at your worshippes handes, albeit my dishabilitie will not permit me to make aunswerable requitall, yet such is the estimation I make of my duetie, that fayling in that I would, I will remaine ready in any thing I may: not that your wor∣shippe hath any neede of mee or mine, but for I would bee lothe that ingratitude should so much insult vppon me, as neither deedes nor dueties shoulde remaine to him, who hath so well deserued. I will therefore containe the mind that poore Irus did, who comming into the Temple of the Goddesse Pallas, and seeing her to holde a Booke in the one hand, & a Launce in the other, made as great ac∣count of her secrete vertues, as her outward valliauncie:
 and therefore sayd, Despitefull Pouertie, thou shalt not keepe me from honouring Pallas, though thou with-holdest me from giuing her Presents. Euen so worshipfull Syr, though the world so frowne vpon me, that I cannot as I woulde: yet that poore Talent which God hath lent me (if it were suffycient for so many courtesies) shall at all times expresse, that I am loth to be vnthank∣full. I therefore desire your worshyppe to accept of thys slender gift, which measured in your wonted freendlie iudgment, I doubt not but shall speede according to my expectation, and the rather, for that there is nothing heerein contayned that may eyther offend the vertuous, or giue any encouragement to the vicious: for if there were any such matters, they shoulde neuer come in your wor∣shippes view.
Not doubting therefore, but to find your worshyppe as I alwayes haue doone, I committee you to the continuall protection of the Almightie, who defende you from all your enemies, and blesse you in remembring the labours of them that haue well deserued.
