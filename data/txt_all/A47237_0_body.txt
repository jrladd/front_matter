My LORD,
THough I am unwilling, to decline any Service, which Your Lordship expects from me, yet when You enjoyn'd me, the Printing of this Sermon, I could not obey Your Command, without disputing it. For I consider'd, that in such an Age as this, where an Exemplary Holiness, is very rare, I shall be thought guilty, of most gross Flattery, in the Cha∣racter I have given, of Your Incomparable Lady, now in Heaven.

But knowing I have so many, unexceptionable Witnesses, to attest every Line I have said, espe∣cially Your Self, who best understood her value, and are most sensible of her loss; and being Conscious to my self, that I have spoken no other throughout, than the words of Truth, I soon broke through, all the discouragements I had, either from the just Censures the World would fix, on the meaness of the Discourse, or from the unjust ones it might pass, on my Insincerity; and resolv'd, to doe all that little Honour I could, to her Memory, and to give God, the glory of her Example: And I humbly beseech the Divine Goodness, that what I now offer to the Publick, may not be wholly unprofitable, to those who reade it; However, I am sure, it will not be unacceptable to Your Lordship, or to those, who were so happy to know her, which will be satisfaction enough, to
My Good LORD,
