My Lord,
THIS Treatise be∣ing by me design'd, for the Vindication of Reveal'd Religion, against those Deistical and Sceptical Notions which are too fre∣quent in this Age, had there been no singular obligations to induce me, yet cou'd I not
 have found a more proper Pa∣tron than your Lordship; whom all must acknowledge to be a Favourer and Prote∣ctor of Religion, Virtue, and whatsoever is Praise-worthy a∣mongst men. I am very sensi∣ble, that my small Station in the Church, might very well have excus'd me, from engag∣ing in an argument which may justly require a Person of more Dignity, Learning, and Lei∣sure, but I am at the same time very well satisfy'd, that your Lordship and all good men will not expect much, where but little is given; and therefore in the same plainness
 and sincerity wherein I at first wrote it, I presume to dedicate it to your Lordship, as a small token, how much, I am,
