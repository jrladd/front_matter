MOst religious and renowned Prince, if the Heathen, reaching no farther than the light of Nature could leade them, sawe those Common-weales would soone flourish, whose Gouernors were giuen to the study of Philosophy; how much rather must Christians ascribe that to heauenlie Wisdome, which they did to earthly, and confesse those Realms to be blessed indeed, where the chiefe Rulers are carefull to seeke first the Kingdome of God, & to prefer the loue of true pietie before all respect of humane policie? For since Gods purpose and promise is to honour them1. Sam. 2. that honour him; and no good thing can be wanting to those that rightly worship him according to his will; how liberall benedictions & mercifull protections may those Princes hope for at Gods hands, who set their hearts wholly to seeke him, and make all their wayes straight in his sight? This fauour from heauen, to be guided by good and godly Princes, the Realme of England hath tasted a long time, to their no small comfort; whiles for these 45 yeeres by the Christian care of a most milde and gratious Queene, (now with God) they haue beene directed to the trueth of the Gospell of Christ; and de∣fended in peace from the violence of all impeachers and im∣pugners of either. And after her decease, though our vnthank∣fulnesse had prouoked the wrath of God, and our vnfruitful∣nesse well deserued, the Kingdome of God should be taken

from vs; yet he that is rich in mercie towards all that call on him, respecting more the glory of his name, lest his enemies should blaspheme, than any worthinesse of ours, not onely continued, but increased his accustomed goodnesse to vs; and gaue your Maiestie, being the lineall and rightfull heire to the Crowne of this Realme, a present and peaceable entrance with the greatest applause of all states, sorts, and sides, that hath beene seene these many ages; and specially of the godlie, who saw the happinesse of the former gouernment would be doubled by the manifolde gifts and graces of your Christian and Princely integrity, clemency, bounty, wisdome, and piety. And surely their hope hath not deceiued them: for who so hath rightly discerned, and duely considered your beignesse of nature, your ripenesse of iudgement, your deepnesse of wis∣dome, your vprightnesse of iustice, your readinesse to mercie, your bounteousnesse to the best, your euennesse to all, your desire of peace, your care of your people, your fauour to your Cleargie, and respect to your Church; your promptnesse in professing, and stedfastnesse in establishing the true seruice of God amongst vs, which your Highnesse hath constantly shew∣ed since you came to the Crowne, can not but acknowledge that to be iustly applied to your Maiestie, which was first sayd of Salomon: Blessed be the Lord your God, which loued you to set you on the Throne (of all Britaine) because the Lord loued this land, & made you King to doe equitie and iustice: happie are those your seruants, which stand euer before you, and heare your wisdome. Whereof, because it pleased God and your Maiestie, I should attend you aswell at your Table in your first Progresse into these Countries of Sur∣rey and Hampshire, as at your conference for matters of Reli∣gion, and assemblie of States for the welfare of this Realme, I can beare certaine and assured witnesse; as likewise can the rest of your Nobles and Bishops then present; who all, with no lesse admiration than contentation, heard, with what sharp∣nesse of vnderstanding, maturenesse of knowledge, soundnesse of reason, firmnesse of memorie, and aptnesse of speech, your Highnesse entred, debated and resolued the greatest and har∣dest points of diuine and humane wisdome; shewing in euery of them such dexteritie, perspicuitie, and sufficiencie, as I pro∣fesse

before God without flattery, I haue not obserued the like in any man liuing. As therefore I iudge the whole Realme blessed and beloued of God for giuing them a Prince of such rare prudence, intelligence, and experience; so doe I after the example of the Apostle thinke my selfe happy, that I shall this dayActs 26. bring these matters in question before so learned, religious, and iudicious a King, no lesse skilfull in the sacred Scriptures, than carefull to continue the true Christian faith thorowout his Dominions, without dissenting from the will of God re∣uealed in his Word, or departing from the primitiue Church of Christ in her best and purest times.
May it then please your excellent Maiestie to be enformed, that vpon some mens too much forwardnesse to innouate as well the doctrine as the discipline of the Church of England, (they thinking those deuices alwayes best, which are newest) it was rife in Pulpits, and vsuall in Catechismes, that the death of Christ Iesus on the Crosse, and his bloudshed for the remis∣sion of our sinnes, were the least cause and meane of our re∣demption; but he did, and must suffer the death of the soule, and the very same paines which the damned doe in hell, before we could be ransomed from the wrath of God; and this was that descent of Christ to hell, which we are taught by the Creed to beleeue. This opinion began to preuaile so fast, that children were trai∣ned to it, and the people led to controle the Scriptures, as not rightly deliuering the true cause of our redemption by Christ, in that they mention no meane to ransome vs from death and hell, but the bloud of his crosse, and death admitted in the bodie of his flesh; and therefore in all such places we must (as they say) by a kinde of Synecdoche conceiue the death of the damned to haue beene suffered for a season in the soule of Christ, and that to be the full and perfect price of our redemp∣tion. I was much grieued, I confesse to your sacred Maiestie, to finde this so often in Catechismes, and frequent in Pulpits, and without iust ground in the Word of God to be so confi∣dently blazed, whiles the doctrine of this Realme, proposed by publike authoritie to the people in the Booke of Homilies, was neglected and loathed: And vpon conference with the most reuerend Father the late Archbishop (now with God)

was aduised in open audience to deliuer, what the Scriptures teach touching our redemption by the death and bloudshed∣ding of Iesus Christ the Sonne of God. Which accordingly I did, declaring by occasion of the Apostles words, Be it far from me to reioyce, but in the Crosse of Christ, first the Contents, and then the Effects of Christes crosse. In the Contents of Christes crosse IThe sermons shewed what Christ suffered by the witnes of holy Scripture, and what he suffered not; and there ioyned this issue; That no Scripture doth teach the death of Christs soule, or the paines of the damned, to be requisite in the person of Christ, before he could be the Ransomer of our sinnes, and Sauiour of the world. And because the proofs, pretended for this point, might be three; Praedictions, that Christ should suffer those paines; Causes, why he must suffer them; and Signes, that he did suffer them: I likewise insisted on all three, and shewed there were no such Praedictions, Causes, nor Signes of the true paines of hell to be suffered in the soule of Christ, before he could saue vs. Where∣in, his Agonie in the Garden, and Complaint on the Crosse were examined, as well by the rules of holy Scripture, as by the maine consent of all the Fathers. And lest the death of Christ suffered in the bodie of his flesh on the altar of the Crosse, as it is described in the Scriptures, and the shedding of his precious bloud should be disabled or distrusted of any, as no sufficient meanes or price of our redemption; in the Effects of Christs crosse, I prooued the merits of Christes suffering to be infinite in respect of his person, who was God, and of the perfection of his obedience vnto the death of the Crosse; the maner of his offering to be bloudie foreshewed by the Sacrifices of the Law, and sealed by the Sacraments of the Gospell; the power of his death to be mightie as able to conquer Sinne, Hell, and Satan; the comfort of his Crosse to be necessarie to which we must all be conformed to suffer with him, before we can raigne with him; the victorie thereof to be heauenly, in that he rose the third day into a celestiall and eternall life, hauing all his enemies vnder his feet. Yet for peace sake I yeelded, the name of hell-paines might in some sort be tolerated in the suf∣ferings of Christ, if we meant thereby great and intolerable paines, as the word is sometimes metaphorically taken in the

Scriptures, at the least by our vulgar translation: for the word indeed was Sheôl, which is vsed aswell for the graue, as for hell; and so those speeches of Dauid, That the paines of Sheol found him out or compassed him, might import the paines of death, which brought men to their graues.
And concerning that Article of our Faith, Christ descended to Hell; I taught, it might not by the course of the Creed be re∣ferred to Christ liuing, but to Christ dead, and safely note the conquest which Christs manhood after death had ouer all the powers of darkenesse, declared by his resurrection, when he rose Lord ouer all his enemies in his owne person; Death, Hell, and Satan not excepted; and had the Keyes (that is, all power) of death and hell deliuered him by God, that those in hea∣uen, earth, and hell should stoope vnto him, and be subiect to the strength and glorie of his Kingdome. These things were first vttered by speech, and after committed to writing, that aswell the parts as proofes of euery point might more plainly ap∣peare to all that would examine them. My care was in either of these to ioyne with the doctrine prescribed by the booke of Homilies to be taught in the Church of God to the people; That there is none other thing, that can be named vnder heauen, toThe first and second Ser∣mon of the Passion. saue our soules, but this only worke of Christes precious offering his bodie vpon the Altar of the Crosse. For so great was Gods wrath and displea∣sure towards sinne, that he could be pacified by no other meanes, but only by the sweet and precious bloud of his deere Sonne. And so pleasant was this sacrifice and oblation of his Sonnes death, which he so obediently and inno∣cently suffered, that God would take it for the onely and full amends for all the sinnes of the world. As for Christs descent to hell, I deliuered the same ends and intents, which the booke of Homilies doth, where it saith; Christes death destroyed death, and ouercame the Diuell.The Sermon of the Resur∣rection. His death destroyed hell with all the damnation thereof. Christ passed thorow death and hell, to the intent to put vs in good hope, that by his strength we shall do the same. He destroyed the Diuell, and all his tyran∣nie, and openly triumphed ouer him, and tooke away from him all his Cap∣tiues (meaning all the Elect) and hath raised, and set them with him∣selfe amongst the heauenly Citizens aboue.
These things thus preached and printed by me, it may please your excellent Maiestie to vnderstand, were first im∣pugned

by an hastie and humorous Treatise, whiles my Ser∣mons were yet vnder the Presse; and after by a larger and wa∣rier Defence, which is this that I now refute. The Treatiser sli∣dingThe Trea∣ise. from the things proposed by me, (wherein he could not open his mouth but with as many vntrueths as words) did beare men in hand the question was, Whether Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God, or no; whereas I mooued no such doubt, but rather acknowledged, That all which Christ suffe∣red in soule or in bodie, was the wrath of God against our sinnes; if we speake as the Scriptures doe of punishments pro∣uided or this life, where Christ did suffer, and not of the wrath to come, which is the vengeance prepared for the Diuell and the damned in another world. And because in this Trea∣tise I found moe distempered pangs of erroneous follie, than aduised steppes of learning or religion, I refelled the chiefe reasons thereof in a Conclusion added to my Sermons, as theyThe Conclu∣sion of the Sermons. were in printing; not thinking it worth my time or paines to make any longer resutation of him, that remembred so little of that I had vttered, and reasoned so loosely for that which he would establish.
No sooner were those Sermons and that Conclusion pub∣lished, but the curious Brethren, seeing their kingdome of conceits impugned, made their obseruations on both, and sent their collections and reasons to the Treatiser, that he might make a fresh Defence; correcting in many things hisThe De∣fence. former rashnesse, and now leading him rather cunningly to cauill with the Fathers speeches, than so proudly to disdaine their testimonies: which maketh him not only to change his minde in many matters from that he sayd before, but often to crosse himsele in the selfe same leafe, whiles he doth not marke what he sayth out of his owne heart, and what he brin∣geth out of other mens supplies and papers. In this Defence (for so they call it) they labour more to impeach my proofes, than to iustifie his former reasons; and as it were slipping their owne necks out of the coller, they inuade my Sermons with their whole might, making the world beleeue, I haue not only proued nothing, but vttered such strange positions, as no Di∣uinitie will endure. Howbeit in their hoatest onsets I might

soone perceiue, they still wrested my words from their right sense, as they did both Scriptures and Fathers; and shrouded themselues vnder certaine generall and ambiguous phrases, as, That Christ suffered the proper wrath and meere iustice of God, and full punishment of sinne, in substance, though not in circumstance; with which they seeke to blinde the Reader and intangle the Op∣ponent, that he should neuer finde their exact and particular Assertion, but they would alwayes be sure to haue a refuge to their large and vnknowen couerts; from which they step not an inch, and without which they say nothing, for feare to be taken tardie with heresie or open impietie.
To waste time, and enter brabbles about words, my mani∣folde businesses and publike seruices did not suffer me; and had not my late Soueraigne (now with God) at her last being at the Castle of Farnham taken knowledge of the things que∣stioned betwixt me and them, and directly commanded mee neither to desert the doctrine, nor to let the calling, which I beare in the Church of God, to be trampled vnder foot by such vnquiet Refusers of trueth and authoritie, I confesse to your excellent Maiestie, I had made farre shorter worke with them, and not spent a quarter of the paper which now is be∣stowed on the cause. Vpon her appointment, which was sa∣cred to me (notwithstanding my sicknesse, which detained me two yeeres from studie, whiles I was forced to seeke the reco∣uerie of my health, and many other affaires and attendances, which continually called me away) I beganne to reuiew the whole; and since there was neither order nor method in their writing, to trace them in their confusion, which hath beene most tedious; and in the end to let them see, That neither for themselues, nor against me, in that whole Defence they haue vttered one true sentence; though the waightiest and most of their matters, besides their darke and deceitfull generalities, be proposed with as it were, in a sense, it seemeth, after a sort, and such like wauering and perplexed speech. I haue opend to your most sacred Maiestie, most prudent Prince, the cause and course of this large Suruey, which it hath pleased God to re∣serue to your Princely view, my late Soueraigne being taken out of this life the beginning of that Summer, wherein I meant

to commit it to the Presse; and so had I done the first yeere of your Maiesties entring into this Realme, had not the infection of your principall citie, and my attendance on your Maiestie (as my duetie bound me) here in this countrey stayed me.
The points handled in the former Sermons, and iustified in this later Suruey, are many, and those very materiall; the chiefe heads whereof, though they appeare aswell in the Titles ouer ch Page, as in the Table prepared of purpose to helpe the confusion of their Defence, yet I will summarily contract and annex to these presents, that your Princely wisdome may with more ease perceiue in euery of these things controuersed, what I defend; and censure the same, when it hath pleased your Highnesse at your leasure to view the particular parts and proofs, as it seemeth best to your learned and religious iudge∣ment. My only desire, and humble petition to your most sa∣cred Maiestic, as becommeth a Christian Bishop, is, That in the foundations of our faith, I meane the worke and meane of our Redemption and Reconciliation to God by Iesus Christ, men be not suffered, vnder your godly gouernment, to preach or publish their vnwritten fansies, and by their continuall Sy∣necdoches, which are manifest additions to the Word of God, to alter and inuert the Trueth, so plainly, fully, and frequently deliuered by the Apostles of Christ in the sacred Scriptures: lest if they get this liberty, with vnnecessary figures where they list to interlace the Word of God in these maine points of Sal∣uation, they leaue neither doctrine nor discipline sound in the end.
And as in the first question they adde to Christes sufferings the death of the soule and of the damned, though there be no such thing warranted or witnessed in the Scriptures; so in the second they outface Christes Descent to Hell with phrases and figures, when it is plainly professed in the Creed, (where not phrases of speech, but Articles of faith are deliuered) and ex∣pressed in the Scriptures, That Christes soule was not left (or for∣saken) in hell; and that very place alleaged by Peter, as properly pertaining to Christ, and no way common to him with Da∣uid, who being a Prophet, knew that God had sworne with an oath to raise vp Christ, to set him vpon his Throne, & to make him Lord (of all)

and Christ, that is, the anointed Sauiour of his people from Sinne, Death, and Hell. And though all the Fathers Greeke and Latine from the Apostles times, haue receiued, beleeued, and deliuered that to be the sense of Peters words; as likewise of Pauls: That Christ, who ascended on high, descended first to the lower parts of the earth; yet they sticke neither at Scriptures, Creeds, nor Fathers, but wrench and wrangle with them all, subiecting euery thing to their sleights and shifts, that they may raigne as they will in the Word of God. Where like∣wise they shame not to condemne all the Fathers Greeke and Latine, as conspiring against the Trueth, and peruerting the Scriptures, by altering the authentike vse of words; for which they appeale to Plato and prophane Poets. This the Treati∣ser blusheth not to write: This Iaffirme; It is only the Fathers abu∣siueTreat. pag. 95. speaking, and altering the ancient sense of Hades, that hath bred this rrour of Christes descending into Hell; their vnapt and perilous transla∣ting it into Latine, Inferi; and our naughtie and corrupt translating in English, Hell, hath confirmed the same. And note heere this first; It is a thing too rife with the Fathers, yea with some of the ancientest of them, to alter and change the authentike vse of words, whereby consequently it is easie for errours and grosse mistakings to creepe in. This lowd and lewd Proclamation he maketh against all Christian Writers, Greeke, Latine, and English, since the first foundation of the Church, and yet therein erreth most absurdly and shamefully. For the Greeke Fathers vse the word Hades, as the Apostles and Euangelists did; for the place where torments after this life are prepared for the wicked; and the prophane Graecians (one conceit of Socrates excepted) did alwayes take it for a place of darkenesse vnder the earth, whither they thought good and bad descended; the wicked to punishment, the better sort to such delights, as carnall men dreampt of after death in their Elysian fields. In both these questions I haue not spared (most religious Prince) aswell to examine the Scrip∣tures with all diligence, as to shew the confession and resoluti∣on of Christs Church long before our times, that all the world may see, I maintaine none other grounds of Faith, nor sense of Scripture, than haue beene anciently, constantly and continu∣ally professed, and beleeued in the Church of Christ for these

fifteene hundred yeeres, till this our present Age; and the same allowed and ratified by the publike lawes of this Realme, which your Maiestie in your most Princely wisdome and cou∣rage professe to vpholde and continue.
God for his holy Names sake blesse your most sacred Ma∣iestie, and prosper all your vertuous and Christian cares, that as in learning and wisdome, in clemencie and pietie, he hath made you the Mirrour of this Age; so in peace and prosperi∣tie, in concord and vnitie, in all happinesse and felicitie, he may exalt you aboue all your neighbour Princes; and ha∣uing vnited the two Realmes of England and Scotland in one subiection vnder your Princely right and regiment, he will knit the hearts and hands of both to honour and serue you, loue and obey you, and your royall issue after you, to the worlds end.
