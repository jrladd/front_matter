MADAM,
HAving the Original of my Lord Viscount MORDAUNT'S Trial by me, I believ'd it a Duty to my Country, to publish so Signal, so great and Generous an Action: that in case Our Nation be traduc'd by Strangers, for so low and mean a Compliance under that horrid USURPER and TYRANT, CROM∣WELL; we may be able to produce upon record as Noble a list of Martyrs and Heroick Spirits, as ever (the number of years considered) suffered for any unfortunate Prince in Europe.
And, Madam, although my Lord Your Son appears not in this Calender in Bloudy Letters, yet, to Your fuller satisfaction, he will ever be Registred in Golden ones; the declension of Cromwell's Fortune and Family taking

its Visible beginning from my Lord Mordaunt's Escape, who was mark'd out a Victim for the Nobility, as Dr Hewet and Sr Henry Slingsby were for the Gentry and Cler∣gie: and his Deliverance had this of singular in it, that having set up his rest on his Defence, he was clear'd by that bloudy pretended High Court of Justice, and re∣mains Recorded the first Precedent of that Nature.
To whom then can I dedicate this Memorial so properly as to Your Ladyship, the Noble Stock from whom this Branch proceeds? And indeed this Remarkable Action was an Honour to Your Family (though ne're so fertile for high Atchievments) as well as to his own, and none can say which of Your Houses has more right to the Glory of it, the Howard, or Mordaunt.
To be particular in the Relation of this were needless, there being thousands of Witnesses, and Westminster-Hall scarce ever so throng'd: Yet I cannot omit to ob∣serve it was manifest to all present, he knew to speak, as well as how to attempt or die.
'Tis now, Madam, visible that God preserv'd Your Son for greater Actions, which to Your lasting comfort You will alwaies remember: How after his unexpected and al∣most Miraculous Escape from the Axe, he calmly undertook a second worthy attempt; the uniting of two long-jarring

Parties, at the time when the Consternation was so univer∣sal upon mens spirits, that few (though otherwise honest) would hear what he design'd (so great a regard had men in those daies to what they desir'd should be thought Prudence.) Ʋpon which Conjunction he founded the certainty of a Noble Warre, or a healing Peace.
The considerable Rising of Sr George Booth satisfies he was not mistaken in the first; and the happy composure of all Our Differences by his Maties Restauration, evinces his foresight Prophetick as to the other.
I protest, Madam, I cannot without some amazement reflect upon the Providences attended him, by Sea, by Land, in all his Concealments and Negotiations: and after he had been so often and publickly proclaim'd Traitor, and the Coasts watch'd to take him, he never in the least declin'd any Risque or Hazzard whatsoever, though he knew Death attended him every Minute if he came to be discover'd; but with a quiet Resignation prosecuted what his heart was set upon, his Maties Restauration, and his Country's Liberty.
How great and Eminent an Instrument he has been to∣wards His Maties Restauration, what Employments and Transactions have been committed to his Prudence and Re∣solution, and how fortunately he has acquitted himself of those great Trusts, and what faithful Services he has ren∣dred

the Crown, is doubtless known to all who pretend to busi∣ness; else I could not but wish all good Fortune and Success to that Merit and Courage which first broke the Ice, and gave Reputation to the Counsels and Party of our long∣banish'd SOVERAIGN.
But, Madam, Your Family will finde greater Re∣wards from His Maty then I dare express: In confidence of which I have no other wish, then bumbly to beseech Your Ladyship to look on me as
Madam,
