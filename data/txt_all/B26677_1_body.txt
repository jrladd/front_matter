My Lord,
The Religious Proclamations of our Gracious Sovereign, the publick Countenance of a National Reformation given by many of the Spiritual and Temporal Lords; the particular Encouragement hereof
 by your Lordship, and most of the Judges; with the warm Zeal of many Justices of the Peace, for the checking the Immoralities of Profligate Sinners, seem to be an happy Token of the length∣ning out of the Nation's Tran∣quillity; and is a plain Demon∣stration, that (notwithstanding our Daring Provocations) the Great God has not yet judici∣ally hidden from our Eyes, the Things of our Peace.
