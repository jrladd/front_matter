Gentlemen,
THE Kindness with which you at first received me, and have all along expressed towards me since my be∣ing placed amongst you, hath been so great and obliging, that I ought not in Reason to deny you any thing, tho' never so much against

my own Inclinations, that you are pleased to request of me: Yet yive me leave to say, that upon my own deliberate perusal of the follow∣ing Discourse, I cannot find any thing in it at all answerable to your Earnestness for its being Printed.
It was the Occasion, the Subject, and the Temper, which, the Consideration of the Won∣derful Deliverance of our Most Gracious King, and these Kingdoms, did on that Solemn Day of Thanksgiving put you into, that made this plain Sermon pleasing to you in the hearing of it, all which Advantages it will want in the Reading.
But however, I had rather fail in any thing, than let slip so fair an Opportunity of shewing my self duly sensible of your Great Respects to me; For which I am, and always will be thank∣ful; And I know no better way of being so to

purpose, than by endeavouring to do amongst you all the good I possibly can.
Which I am assur'd I cannot more effectu∣ally do, than, after your immediate Duty to God, by encouraging and promoting an Hear∣ty Obedience to the King and Church, and a sincere Love and Friendship amongst your selves. To effect which shall be the constant study and labour of,
Gentlemen,
