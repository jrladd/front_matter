Right Honourable,
I Have no ambition to appear in Print,
but where His Majesties Service, the
Good of the Honourable Corporation, and
the Improvement of the whole Level, and
Counties adjacent, are effectually the Que∣stion.
I shall without much difficulty
subject this following Discourse to the
view of the Publique; and I take a Con∣fidence
to beg of Your Lordship, that it

may come abroad under Your Patronage.
I hope it will not be needful for me to pro∣claim
my Integrity in this Affair, having
had the Honour to spend a great deal of
Time, and Money, in prompting it; and
being at last dismissed for Causes, which in
modesty I shall conceal. As to my Abilities
of making good what I undertake, I shall
readily submit my Reasons and Proposals
to the strictest Examination; and if I fail
in the Main, I shall patiently abide the
Reproach: But if my Design shall be
found in the end practicable, and not onely
that, but incomparably less Expensive, then
any way hitherto practised, or propounded,
I perswade my self, that Your Lordship
will not repent the owning me in what I
now say, or in what I shall hereafter do, as
Right Honourable,
