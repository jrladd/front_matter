Right Honourable,
I Thinke my selfe happy as Saint Paul said to King Agrippa, that I have occa∣sion given mee to plead before one, who is red in all Customes and que∣stions, that so those which speake evill of the Sermon may bee ashamed by your justification of it, to whom I make bold to dedicate it. Not that by your greatnesse it should be defended, if it give just offence, but by your worthinesse pro∣tected from unjust calumnies of suspition, of which the world is now so full that Jealousie hath given faith her pasport and she is gon. Be∣ing
therefore fallen into these dregges of time wherein wee can hardly draw off cleare Wine without racking some new opinions, which are so toothsome. I thought good to try if I could but helpe to settle those muddie Lees by expounding some Texts of love, peace and obedience. But my good meaning hath been so much mistaken, and my words wrested, yea threatned, yet not by either wisedome or greatnesse that I am for∣ced to present this Sermon to your L rdships cen∣sure First, and next to the view of the world. To the world for my vindication to your Honour for expression of my duty in which I shall ever rest
