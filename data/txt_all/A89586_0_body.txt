Honorable, and Beloved,
THe holy King and Prophet David, required that the prayses of God should be sung upon well tuned Instruments; and some Psalmes which himself composed to that pur∣pose, he styled Michtam, golden Psalms; as being full of precious and choise treasure. Such could I have wished might the Instrument have been, and such the Song of Praise and Thanksgiving, to have celebrated the goodnesse of God, for this late wonderfull preservati∣on of your Honorable Assembly, and the famous, and worthy City; both whose ruine was plotted and designed by wicked and unreasonable men. But you were pleased, not onely to designe to this service, a weak and untuned Instrument, (though not Crackt, as Malice, and Slander hath bruted it abroad) but also

to injoyn the publishing of this song of Thanksgiving, which is full of weak and imperfect Notes. And to this latter task, I was (I confesse) farre more unwil∣ling then to the former; as being conscious unto my self, how few conceptions could be brought by me to any such maturity, as might render them meet to become the standing Monument of so great a Mercy, and so happy a Day, which is worthy to be ingraven on Mar∣ble, rather then to be written on Paper, and with let∣ters of gold, rather then with ink: But in the pur∣suance of your Commands I have done it, and added some few things, which time nor strength would permit Some few instances, clearing the main Doctrin, and some in largement of the first Use. me to deliver in publike; Being resolved to deny my self, and to do nothing that may hinder me from being what I am, and shall always desire to remain,
