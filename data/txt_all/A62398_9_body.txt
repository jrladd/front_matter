THe Guns proclaim'd aloud on every Hill,
The joyful acclamations of the Scots People;
The which did Thunder with so high a strain,
As if Great Mars they mean't to entertain:
True Mirth and Gladness was to every Face,
And Healths run bravely round in every place;
That sure I think the seventh day of Iuly,
At the Reid-swair should ne're forgotten be;
That was a day to his everlasting Fame,
The valiant Laird Wat brought in the worthy Name,
That day should ever be dedicat to Mirth,
As if it had been a Soveraign's Birth:
VVhen valiant VVat that worthy Man,
Brought in the Name of Scot, well to be seen;
It was nothing ye'll say to bring them in,
But to th'effusion of his Blood,
He brought them back again,
The Executors and Tutors, that hath been in our time,
The Honour of the Scots did ne're so much proclaim:
The old Verse I must give in,
Though men should say I'm drunken,
How VVat thy Guid-sir, that worthy Man,
To the Red-swair brought his Troup,
The seventh day of Iuly, the sooth to say,
At the Red-swair the tryst was set;
Our Wardens they did fix a day,
As they appointed, so they met.
The Lord Buckcleugh he was but young,

Carmichael was Warden in his place,
The Laird Wat, that worthy Man,
Commanded the Sirname with great Grace:
Thy Pedegree is soon discribed,
I think I may do it well enough.
Thy Father Charles was Laird VVats Son,
VVho was natural Son to Scot of Buckcleugh,
Their Generations is formerly described,
I need them not describe again,
Both Walters and Williams and Sir Arthur;
Unto the ninth Generation;
From whence such men may gather their relief,
That though a Ram-head may be cause of grief,
Yet nature hath a remedy found out,
They should have Lyons hearts to bear it out;
Though I call'd thee Shepherds Swain,
Yet I deserve no blame;
I hope that Iasons Golden-fleece
VVith thee still shall remain.
