RIGHT WORSHIPFULL,
IT is said that the silly Wren, the least of all Birds, takes her chiefest shelter under the Eagles wings, and that the Princely Vnicorne

delighting in Musick would stand stil to heare (after the sweet singing Phi∣lomela had sounded out her melodious and silver sounding tunes) the poore Thrush to warble out her chat, and so sometimes, that great Augustus (who made the VVorld to tremble) would vouchsafe to hear and read, the home∣ly work of a rustick Shepherd, aswell as the learned and lofty Verse of Vir∣gill: All which imboldneth me (poor Vassall) to dedicate this poore Pam∣phlet, being the tragicall discourse of my lives Catastrophe to your noble selfe, Verse I dare not call, neither prose; it is but a poor, plain, brief and true rehersall of my disasters in that little service and poore travell that I have undergone, being the space of forty yeares: Beseeching your noble

selfe, to be the Eagle, to shelter this my poore Wren-like worke, under the shadow of your loving wings; and to heare the Rurall tune of a poore Ru∣sticke Souldier clattering in an Iron coat, aswell as Orpheus with his dain∣ty Musick, clad in a Peacock coloured sute, singing out his delighting Sirens songs more then Philomela like, and as Augustus to daigne to looke down so low, as to take the view of tragicall discourse of a poor souldiers unfortu∣nate passages, as the thrice noble verse of learned Spenser, Draiton, and their fellows: happy shall I think my selfe, if you will not be displeased at my pre∣sumption, but much more happy shal I bee, if your Worship will but give my poor widows mite your kind and favourable acceptance: I hope the

better, in regard I found your favour once in Bohemia, being utterly un∣known, being then (as I am still) very poore, it was not then, nor is not now for any gift I sought or seek more then your noble and loving countenance, and respect. Thus will I rest, leaving your noble self to the Lords protecti∣on, and my self and my poore Cata∣strophe to the VVorlds view, and sharpe censure of many viporous and malignant tongues.
