MY good Lord, as Gods grace and high
calling made you great, and in speciall
fauour with the Rulers of this Land,
and in that while, called your Lordship
to be well liked of the late Archbishop
of Canterbury, (for some your good
vertues:) so I, in boldnesse of those good parts, dedicate
to your Lordship, the life and death (in verse) of the
matchlesse Archbishop of Canterbury, lately deceased.
