Sir, Madam,
I Do here present you with this following Relation, the matter of which did first chiefly derive from you, thro the im∣portunity of some, who having been witnesses to several re∣markable
 passages of this Young Lady, your Daughters exem∣plary Life, desired a further ac∣count of it for their private be∣nefit, and afterwards procured your leave to publish it for the good of others. I acknowledge the manner of the Relation is very unworthy of so great a Subject; and (you know) the matter is but little to what might have been written of her: but yet sufficient (I hope) to convince the World (of what was a main end of its publication) that the Reli∣gion of our Saviour Jesus Christ is really practicable in far higher degrees than we ordinarily ob∣serve
 it, even in good Christi∣ans. Altho one would think, that to take a true delight in the use of Gods Creatures, and yet to value them as nothing to the favour of God and the knowledge of Jesus Christ; to perform Holy Duties with a na∣tural Readiness and most intire Affection; to be conversant with any company or outward concerns (as occasion might re∣quire) and yet preserve inno∣cence inviolate, and abate no∣thing of an ardent desire after God and Glory; is peculiar to such, who (with this Young Lady) began a Reformation of their Hearts before there
 needed any in their Lives; and therefore are not solicited (as o∣thers) with the remembrance of past Follies, to abate their Comforts, retard their Progress, or interrupt their Pursuit of E∣ternal happiness. She was (you know) a rare Example of all Christian Vertues; and there∣fore I know not whether I ought more to condole your loss in her departure, or con∣gratulate your happiness that you once had her. It is doubt∣less a great honour to nurse up Children (as you have done this and many others) to the Kingdom of Heaven. And there may be also great satisfaction
 in the probability of winning others to the same by her Ex∣ample. You can (with much comfort I hope) remember how this excellent Person walked with God, and from a sense of his favour, expected with an holy impatience, till she should be with him. So that it was no wonder a short sickness should release her Soul from its pri∣son, which did daily (in her best health of body) half expire in most earnest longings after Heaven and Glory. And now she enjoyeth this, the great ob∣ject of her Desires, the reward of her Faith, Patience, and ho∣ly Conversation. And that the
 God of Mercy would daily fit you both more and more for the same unspeakable Happiness, is the Prayer of
