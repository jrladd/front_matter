MY LORD,
THE Design of this Treatise being only to inspire the English Nation with a greater Love of their LIBERTIES, by repre∣senting (in its true Colours) the miserable Slavery to which France is reduced, it could not properly be address'd to any other then to a publick Assertor of the publick Liberty. But amongst the several Com∣petitors for that glorious Title, I think, I may with ju∣stice say, no Person has so good a claim to it, as your Lordship: Your being committed to the TOWER, and a
 SCAFFOLD erected for your Tryal, are Demonstrations that they who then conspired the Ruin of England, look'd upon your Lordship as a principal Bulwark that obstruct∣ed their Designs; and theresore did their utmost to remove you, in order to their farther Progress. Your Lordship's SUFFERINGS for the Nation's safety entitled you to the General Thanks of the Kingdom; though I must not say, your Lordship was the only Nobleman that was struck at by the Persecution (not to say Tyranny) of those Times.
But whosoever recalls to mind the Transactions of 1688, must withal remember the important Services wherewith you signalized your self for the RESCUE of this Nati∣on. You, my Lord, amongst the illustrious Undertakers, durst shew a good Example by appearing the FIRST in Arms, and displaying in open Field the Colours of Li∣berty, thereby giving Life to that famous, but languishing, Association, when it had been almost cast away in a Storm at Sea.
This is a glorious Circumstance, and (must be allowed) pe∣culiar to your Lordship.
There are some Persons in the World, who appear very zealous for their Country, and for their Princes; and yet have been so unhappy, as not to escape the Prejudices of ha∣ving their Zeal been thought to have chiefly centred on their private Interests: What your Lordship has done, leaves no room for any such Suspicion: for nothing can be found more disinteressed.

You have vigorously asserted the Right of your Country, and as vigorously express'd your Zeal to their MA∣JESTIES, in contributing so much to the placing the Crown on their Heads, and afterwards, your Fidelity, in that great Share which it is well known your Lordship had in its farther Settlement by the Recognition-Bill,
You have done all to an Eminent Degree, and all this too at your own Expence: For hitherto your Great and No∣ble Services have only been their own Reward.
What I have as yet mentioned concerning your Lord∣ship, has been only with relation to publick Affairs, and the Service of their present Majesties; but what could I not say of those shining Qualities and Vertues which are conspicuous in your Lordship, and render you eminently va∣luable to all those who have the Honour of being personally acquainted with you.
These are Particulars I could easily enlarge upon, with∣out fearing any other Censure than that of your own Mode∣sty, which I am unwilling to offend; but Justice obliges me (at least) to say, that what your Lordship has per∣formed for the Publick deserveth the Gratitude that di∣stinguish'd the first Age of the Roman Commonwealth; and will be admired so long as People retain any Sense of, and Love for Liberty.
These, my Lord, must needs be the Sentiments of all true English Men; since even Natives of other Countries
 are charmed with so extraordinary a Merit, for which I cannot but express the greatest Veneration, though I was born and bred up in a Country wholly infected with Servi∣tude. Wherefore upon so just an occasion, I thought it my Duty, as it is my Ambition, to profess my self with all imaginable Respect and Sincerity,
My LORD,
