My Lord,
WHen I Petitioned your Lordship to appoint the Easter Sessions, at Dorking, I little expected the Honour the Gentlemen on the Bench were pleased to do me in chusing me for their Chair∣man; but when I was forc'd to submit to their Commands, in accepting an Office for which I was so ill qualified, I was ex∣tremely surprized at the unusual Compliment the Grand Jury first, and then the Court, made me, in desiring me to Pub∣lish the Charge I gave them. All the importunities I could use, proved insufficient to excuse me from appearing thus in Publick; and I was forc'd out of deference to their Judgments, and obedience to their Orders, though with the greatest Re∣luctance, to execute on my self a Sentence so Severe. For though there is nothing in these Papers that an honest Man need be ashamed of; yet the World will be apt to judge of them, not according to the sincerity of the Author, but the ex∣actness of the performance And there ought to be Wit, and Eloquence, Sense, and Judgement, as well as a good intention in those that appear in Print. I am sensible, My Lord, how deficient I am in the first mentioned Qualifications, and there∣fore I thought it necessary to beg your Lordship's Protection for this Discourse. And indeed, whether I consider your Lord∣ship

as a zealous Patron of Religion and Vertae, or as a true Friend to the Interests of your Country, and, by consequence, entirely devoted to their Majesties Service; or whether I con∣sider the High Office your Lordship so deservedly enjoys in this County, and the Obligations I owe your Lordship for ho∣nouring me with your Friendship; in all these respects, my Lord, there can be no Person so fit as your Lordship, to defend the following Sheets from the Censures of Atheistical Liber∣tines, and Seditious Male-contents. If we were to judge of the Strength of these two Parties by their Clamour, and their positiveness in what they assert, then Religion, Vertue, and Loyalty might justly be apprehensive of them as dangerous and formidable Enemies. But those Arguments had need be irre∣fragable that can perswade a Man of Sense, either that Wick∣edness and Goodness are of the same intrinseck Value, and e∣qually eligible; or that a Despotick Monarchy is preferable to the excellent Model of our English Government. And though they were Masters of as much Wit and Art as the Epicurean Poet, or the Malmsbury Philosopher, (whose Dictates they for the most part Copy after) yet Principles that are in them∣selves false, and, besides that, undermine the Publick Securi∣ty, and destroy the private Happiness of Mankind must never hope to be generally entertained, unless they have better re∣commendations than superficial Sophistry, and smooth Lan∣guage. But, my Lord, 'tis the proper Business of a Dedication to be on the Defensive: and therefore I shall not engage my self any farther in this Quarrel.—I have only this to say in be∣half of my self, that whoever thinks I have prostituted my Pen either to Revenge, Covetousness, or Ambition, is very much mistaken; for as I never received any personal Affront or In∣jury from the last Government, so neither do I expect or hope for any profitable Employments, or great Places under the pre∣sent: But am as free on the one hand from Malice, as I am on

the other from Flattery. By this the World may see I have no private Aims, but have sincerely and freely declared the Genuine and Ʋnbyast dictates of my Reason. And these I pre∣sume to shelter under your Lordship's Patronage; and since I have been, as it were, forc'd to Print these Papers, it is no small comfort to me that I have thereby an Opportunity pub∣lickly to own your Lordship's kindness in appointing, at my re∣quest, the last Sessions at Dorking, and in giving me reason to hope that that place shall now and then, by your Lordships grant, share an advantage from which it hath for some time been excluded, and which, I assure my self, they will for the future deserve better by prevailing with the Justices to fill the Chair with a person fitter for that Employment, then,
My Lord, 
Betchworth Apr. 12. 1692.
