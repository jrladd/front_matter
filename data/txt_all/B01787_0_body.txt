May it please Your Honours,
THE last Sessions of Parliaments, I presented You with Proposals for setting up a National Land-Bank, and in order thereunto a Bill was brought in, by order of the Honourable the House of Com∣mons, and was referred to a Committee, who made a considerable Progress therein: But the Bill not passing through the House, for want of Time, I did not intend to put my Proposals in practice until the next Sessions of Parliament, fearing it might be look'd upon as a Disrespect to Your Honours (wherein I have al∣ways been very cautious of offending) to begin a Business of so great Importance, before I had an Authority from Your Honours for my so doing: But some Gentlemen who pretended they could not understand my Scheme, while the Bill was depending before the House of Commons, have formed the Model of a Bank out of the Book I presented to Your Honours; only, to make it look like a Novelty, have spoil'd my Design by some Alterations of their own.
It is doubtless a Duty incumbent upon all the Subjects (as I mentioned in my Treatise, Intituled A Discourse on the late Funds, which I presented to both Houses of Parliament) to propose to Your Honours whatsoever may occur to any of them for the Service of the Publick, and whosoever spends his Time and Estate in so doing presumes he is safe, and under Your Honours Protection: if not, it will certainly be a Bar to all future Ingenuity, and will for ever discourage Persons from offering any thing to Your Honours that may tend to the Good of the Nation. But I am well satisfied Your Honours will not countenance any, who shall go about to deprive me of the Fruit of my Industry; and therefore tho I have been often told, that the Persons who are engaged in setting up a Bank in opposition to me, will certainly bear me down by an Interest too powerful for me to withstand, yet I think my self secure in Your Honours Justice and Impartiality, and in assurance thereof I shall (God willing) proceed upon what I have undertaken, not doubting but with Your Honours Assistance to surmount all those Difficulties, which the Igno∣rance of some, and Envy of others, may lay in my way. I beg leave to subscribe my Self,
