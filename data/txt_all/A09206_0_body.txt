Right Noble and Worthy Gentle-men:
I Have presumed, the first, to bewaile in publike, the
death of the much honoured, but more lamented
Lady, the Countesse of WARWICK your de∣ceased
Ant, so reowmed, and beloved for her Pi∣tie
and Goodnesse, that shee needeth no Memoriall
at all, and in truth, Fame profiteth not the dead, as a Poet
saith.Nil juv it fa∣ma sepultos. But in regard she hath beene so faire a President for Posteri∣tie
to imitate, and that my selfe have beene much bounden unto hee,
for her Honourable respect ever towards mee, I could not mourne to
my selfe, beside moved to the contrarie by a particular occasion. Some
few yeares agoe, her Honour sent unto me, and requested mine ad∣vice,
far the erecting of a Monument in SNARFORD Church
for her selfe, according to the convenience of the place: I drew the

Modell of one, and presented her Honour with the same, adding (as
was her desire) a plaine, but short and proper Inscription, leaving
underneath a space for an Epitaph, there to be inserted after her death,
that might containe some dozen lines or more, which (if I should
out-live her) it pleased her Honour to impose upon me to performe:
I promised her I would, though out of the naturall goodnesse, and
sweet humilitie of her minde, she never affected praise, or applause,
either in life, or after her death, for any good de that ever shee did.
So that since herein I could not forme my promise, her Honours
minde, for the disposing of her corps at the time of her death (for
some reasons perhaps knowne unto her ) being altered, I tooke
mine owne time, and entured (as drawing the Crtaine from an
excellent Picture) to shew her to the beholder at the full, and in a
faire light.
Wherefore, at my little leasure would serve, it spare houres, shortly
after her death (being employed in a toilsome calling) I composed
this small Poem, which under the protection of your names (who
are so much beloved and honoured in Lincolnshire; moreover, Bre∣thren,
her Nephewes, and Exequtors to her last Will and Testa∣ment)
I consecrate to her eternall Memorie, and offering (for her
sake) the same in all dutifull affection unto your Patronage, I take
leave.
