THat waightie
charge of Sa∣lomon
(Right
worshipfull) to
euery sonn of
wisdome, for
thePro. 4. 23. keeping of his heart aboue
all watch and ward, may well
perswade vs, that some mat∣ters
of great importance de∣pend
thereon: Among many
(because my gates may not
be great before so small a ci∣tie)
I will touch one. There is
a strange desire, not of earthly
but of spirituall powers: after
the possession of mans heart:

God saith,Pro. 23. 26., my sonne giue me
thy heart; and to him indeed
the right belongs: Yet tho∣rough
mans transgressiō Sa∣tan
hath got such hold ther∣of,
that vnlesse it be by diuine
power hee will not be kept
out; & though we heare not
Satans voice, yet hisSee Acts. 5. . Luk. 22 3. dealing
bewraies his meaning, that
aboue all things in man he
desires the heart. Once hee
stroue about a dead mans body,Moses body, Iude 9.
but doubtles his purpose
therein was to haue set vp
an Idoll for himselfe in the
hearts of the liuing. But what
is mans heart that it should
be so desired? Surely in sub∣stance
little, but for imploy∣ment
almost infinite: It is a
TreasureMat. 12. 35. whereout man
bringeth all his actions good,
or evill: It is a temple wherin is



either the Arke of God,Hinc fons bo∣ni, & peccan∣di origo. Hie∣ron. ad deme∣triad. or Da∣gon
for the Deuill: Yea, it is
aAugust. in p. 148. pallace wherein dwelleth,
and a throne whereon sitteth
either Christ, or Satan, thePsal. 24. 7.
king of glory, or theEphes. 6. 2▪ prince of
darknes: andQui, posse di ipse imperabit ibid. Aug. he that keeps pos∣session
will there excercise domi∣nion.
Neither may we thinke
that one heart wilsuffer both
these;Mat. 6. 24. no man can serue two
masters; God will haue all or
none;Quia it ibi prs aliqua Diabolo dis∣cedit Dens iratus; & pos∣sidet tou diabolus. Au∣gust in Ioh. if any part be shared
from him, in high dispeasure he
leaues the rest, and so the whole
falls to the deuil. Now sith the
case standeth thus with mans
heart, doth it not neerly cō∣cerne
euery one to know his
owne estate in this behalfe:
to wit; what kind of treasury,
whose Temple; whose pallace
and throne his heart is, that if
all be wel he may reioyce, &



so keepe it for the Lord; if o∣therwise,
then seeke redresse
betime.
To this purpose serues this
present treatise: wherein as
in a glasse may first be seene,
the fearfull state of mans natu∣rall
heart,The summe of this Trea∣tise. full frought with e∣uill
thoughts, void of good
consideration and so most fit
for Satan: Then after doe
those blessed meanes appeare,
whereby mans naturall heart
may be reformed, to become
the temple of God, the seat of
grace, and aCant. 6. 1. bed of spices for
the welbe loued to feed vpō. And
these are points of that im∣portance,
that whosoeuer
neglecteth them, may say
farewell grace; & bid adue to
god himselfe: for in the hart,
if at all in man, ust these be
seated.


Now the publishing here∣of
being cōmitted vnto me,
I present the same vnto your
worships, and vnder your pro∣tection
desire to commend it
to the church of God. It
would too much enlarge my
gates to annex the manifold
reasons which mooue me to
this choise on your behalfe;
onely this I pray; (that seeing
it is the first fruits of my la∣bours
in this kind wherein I
had full power of free choise
in my dedicatiō) it may inti∣mate
to you both, mine vn∣fained
hearts desire of that
ever-lasting good I wish vn∣to
your soules; and also testi∣fie
in part my thankful mind
for your manifold fauours to
me, and mine who depend
vpon you.
Now God Almighty blesse



your worships with your chil∣dren
and familie, according
to your seuerall necessities
of his mercie and goodnes,
for soule and body, in this
life and for euer. Cambridge.
