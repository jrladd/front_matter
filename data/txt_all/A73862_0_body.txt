ALthough our sundry (yet our sacred) flames,
Worke diuers and as contrarie effects:
Yet then your owne, we seeke not other names,
Nor stranger arches our free Muse erects.
Though limmitlesse be (naturally) our loue,
We can her powers officiouslie confine:
Who can instruct her orderly to moue,
And keepe the compasse wisely we assigne.
To take our faire leaue (till that ampler times
Some glorious obiect strongly may beget)
We make you tender of these hallowed rimes
The vertuous payment of a worthier debt.
Till to our names that monument we reare,
That steele and marble vnto dust shall weare.
