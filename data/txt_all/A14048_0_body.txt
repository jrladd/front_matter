IT is not vnknowen un¦to your Princely Maiestie that of late iasked yow leue to hūt a certeyn romishe fox / withe in the boūdes of your dominiones / whi¦che had bene hyd more thē seuen yeares / among the Bishopes of Englande / after that your hyghe¦nes had commanded them to dryue hym clerely out of all places where as ye / haue any poure ot or dominacion. And now am i crediblely infor∣med / that ye haue sene the cours that i had at thys forsayde fox yowre fo / withe many of your nobles & learned men / whiche i suppose will not denys but that i haue founde oute the fox / withe my hoū¦des / in the self places where as i rekened before my huntyng to fynde hym / that is in the chirche

a monge the bisshoppes & prestes whome ye cō∣manded straytly to dryue hym awaye / But as soun as my houndes had founde out the fox and held hym at a bay / that he kould nether go back nor furthe / redy to be taken if any mā / wold haue layde handes upō hym / a certayn sworn aduocate of thys beste / a doctor of the popis doctrine / dro∣ue mi houndes from the beste / and rescued hym and saued hys lyfe bearyng me in hande that the beaste was no fox / but on of your rede dear / euen as i prophecied before that the foxy generation wold call theyr father the fox when soeuer that he shuld cum in any ieperdy of takynge. Thys forsayd proctour of the beste calleth hym / not al∣on your rede dere / but also good ordre / good poly∣tike lawes / where withe good hathe en closed all youre subiectes vnder your autorite alone / the pa¦le of the Englishe chirche / withe diuers suche o∣ther goodly names. How beit at lengthe / he grā¦tethe hym self / that the beste whiche i hunt is the romishe fox in dede / but that it was nether youre mynde nether any wyse mannis mynde / to dryue out the hole fox / but that it was thought sufficiēt if hys eares were only cut of harde by the rootes all rhe reste of hys body and especially hys gorgi∣ous and fayre tale / remanyng vntouched / And where as i dispraysed the beste withe diuers o∣ther / he as it becummeth an aduocate / prayseth hym hyghly / sayng that thoghe in one thyng he ha¦the don amis / that is where as he preferred hym self aboue the lyon whiche is kynge of all bestes / 

yit that in all other thynges he is good good good and commendable / & that if he were dryuen a∣way with all hys ordinances / that all semelynes / all relygious & deuout behauore & all godlynes shuld bedryuen a wey also / what is thys ellis but to make agod of the fox? Thys forsayde patron of the fox was one of them whome i accused in my former course / for a couerer and a manteyner of the romishe fox & hys whelpes / But now (by what meanes it is cum to pass i can not tell) he is cummed from a defendent and a persone accu∣sede to be an accuser / an examiner & a iudge / o∣uer the mater whiche is in controuersy betwene him & me. I lay vnto his charge that he is the mā¦tener of the fox / whiche i proue bothe withe scri¦pture & natural reson / & he beyng accused hym self / examineth my witnesses / and refuseth them all together at hys pleasure / & callethe me hereti∣ke & iudgely pronuncieth that i am an heretike / but with out any witnes or reson at all. I besech your learned hyghenes to consydre whether thys mater be in differently handlede or no / that on man openly accused of a greate offence / shallbe bothe defendent examiner iudge & accuser all ate one tyme. Is it any meruel if the thefe escape hā¦gynge whiche is suffered to be hys own examiner & iudge (If that lucifer the greate deuel might haue suche liberti / to do what he lyst to accuse whon he wolde / & then to be bothe hys own wit¦nes & iudge / wo shuld cum to all goodmen & he shuld neuer be condemned hys self whiche were

great pytie. Where fore i beseche your hyghnes / as thys mater that is betwen us / is no small ma∣ter / to appoynte sum indifferent learned men / sum of the Clergie / & other sum of the laite / to ex∣amin frely with out ieperdy of theyr lyues / thys mater whiche is betwene use / and not to suffer my aduersary bothe to be my accuser and exami∣ner / and his iudge and myne bothe together all at one tyme. Thys ones brought to pass and li∣cence once granted agayn to hunt the rauenyng fox / which i dowt not but that ye will grant me for the loue that ye haue to the libertie of your lo∣uing subiectes / i trust that we shall not nede he∣re af ter to hunt the fox any more / hys ayders & manteyners and he shall be so manifestly and o∣penly knowen / who and where they be. Thys that i go about shall not ouly minish the murder of the cruel fox / and purches spirituall liberti unto ma∣ny agood man / but also shall turn to the great ho∣nor and good name of all the hole realme / whi∣che in many cuntrees is sore sflandered for to be au upholder of the beste that we pretēded to ban∣niss he away / They that sit ot home and haue not bene in far cuntrees / cannot tell what reporte goethe abrode in other landes of our nacion / But they whiche ar and haue bene in strange landes / ar comppelled sumtymes to heare it that they wold not heare uery gladly / of our cuntre for hol∣dyng of suche doctrine and ordinances as all the worlde knowethe to be of the bisshop of romes makyng cand contrary to the holy worde of God.

Who grante yow helth of bothe body and soule / uictori ouer your enemies and grace to do in thys our mater of religion as shall be most to the / glori of God and the profit of the comun welthe / 
Amen.
