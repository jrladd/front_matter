SIR,
THE desire I always had to
serve You, encouraged me
to prefix Your Name to this fol∣lowing
Treatise.

Which being Collected from
the best of our English Historians,
whose Writings You have frequent∣ly
conversed with, I presum'd that
what was here so compendiously
Digested, would revive in Your
Mind some remarkable Observati∣ons,
not unworthy Your remem∣brance.
You have here, SIR, a short
view both of the ancient and pre∣sent
state of England; as also an
account of the most memorable
Battels, annex'd to the places near
which they were Fought. I have
spar'd for no Pains and Industry
to make it Perfect, I being ear∣nestly
desirous that it might in
some manner Merit Your Favour
and Esteem; which being once
gain'd, would be a great means in
engaging others (who are ambi∣tious

of emulating Your Exam∣ple)
to receive it kindly.
How happy I have been in this
Performance, the Reader can best
determine; this I am sure of, That
if Learning and Sense, Wit and
Humour, join'd with an Address
that is every way becoming and
agreable, are accomplishments fit
to recommend a Gentleman, All
those who know You, and those
who are to know You, will ap∣plaud
my Judgment in chusing
You for my Patron.
Be pleased then, SIR, to af∣ford
a kind Reception to these my
first Offerings; let the fulness of
my Joy for Your safe return
amongst us, plead in my behalf,
and make an atonement for the
Faults You will here meet with.
Give me leave to hope that this

short Description of Your own
Country, which cannot but be
very dear unto You, may find
some place among those excellent
Remarks which You have so late∣ly
made Abroad.
SIR, since the greatness of
Your Quality forbids me to come
near You as a Friend, Permit me
to Subscribe my self with all ima∣ginable
sincerity,
SIR,
