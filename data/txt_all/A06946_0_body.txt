Worthy Sir:
KNowledge which is the diuine mother of certaine Goodnesse, neuer came vnwelcome to a knowing Iudgement; no more I hope Shall this my La∣bour to your worthy Selfe, since doubtlesse you shall finde in it many things New, somethings necessary, and nothing which th not in it some particular touch of profit: It is a worke your former incouragements to my other labours did create in me; and the wants you worthi∣ly found, I hope shall bring you supplies both wholesome and becomming. The experience I assuer your Goodnesse, was the expence of a bitter and tedious Winter, but the contentme (in gaining my wish) made it more pleasant then all the three other Seasons. What euer it be, it comes to you full of loue, full of seruice: And since I know Vertue measureth all things by its owne goodnesse; it is enoughto me, that I know you are that Vertue. In you is power to iudge; in you is Authoritie to exercise Mercy, lth them both flye from your Goodnesse, with that mildnesse, that in them my hopes may be Crowned, and my Selfe rest euer at your serice.
GERVASE MARKHAM.
