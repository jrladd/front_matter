SIRS,
THe dedication of Bookes, to the names of men worthy, and of e∣steem
in their generation, takes sanctuary in so Catholick and Anti∣ent
prescription, that to use any defensative about my walking in
the same path, cannot but forfeit the loss of somewhat more, then
the paines that would be spent therein. Now although in addresses
of this kind, men usually prevaile themselves of the occasion, to de∣liver
their thoughts as to particulars, in great variety according
as their concernments may be; yet the Reasons which are general∣ly
pleaded as directions for the choise of them, to whom with their
labours, and writings they so address themselves, are for the most
part uniforme; and in their various course, transgress not the Rules of certaine heads,
from whence they flow. To express a gratitude for respects and favours received, by retur∣ning
things in their kind eternal, for those which are but temporal: to obtaine Counte∣nance
and Approbation unto their endeavours in their breaking forth into the world, from
names of more esteem, or at least more knowne, then their own: to advance in repute by a
Correspondency in Judgment, with men of such esteem, intimated thereby; are the more in∣genuous
aimes of men in the dedications of their writings. Though these, and sundry other
pretences of the same kind, might justly be drawn into my plea, for this address unto you; yet
your peculiar designation and Appointment, through the good hand of the providence of
God, to the defence of the Gospel; and your eminent Furnishment with Abilities from the
same hand, for the performance of that glorious duty, is that alone, upon the account where∣of
I have satisfied my selfe, and hope that I may not dissatisfie others, as to this present Appli∣cation.
What there is of my own peculiar concernment, wherein I am like to obtaine a more
favourable Condescention in Judgment, as to my present undertaking from you, then
from other men, will in the close of my address, crave leave to have mention made there∣of.
Brethren! the outward obligations that are upon you from the God of truth, with the
Advantages which he hath intrusted you withal, for the defence of his Truth, above the most
of men in the world, are evident, even to them that walke by the way, and turne little aside to
the consideration of things of this nature, importance, and Condition. And it is to me an
evidence of no small incouragement, that God will yet graciously imploy you in the work and
labour of his Gospel, by his constant giving a miscarrying wombe to all them, who have attem∣pted
to defraud the Nation, and the Churches of God therein, of those helpes and furtheran∣ces
of Piety and Literature, with whose management, for their sevlice, you are at present in∣trusted.
Of the Jewels of Silver and Gold, whereof by the Lord's appointment, the Children
of Israël coming out from amongst them, spoiled the Egyptians, did they dedicate to the Ta∣bernacle
in the wilderness; when, the Lord planted the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the
Earth; and said to Sion Thou art my people. Though some outward provisions, and furnitures
of Literature, now, through the good hand of God, made serviceable to you in your Atten∣dance
upon the great Worke, and imployment committed to you, were first deposited, when
thick darkness was over the land: Yet that they may be made eminently subservient to the will
of God, in raising up againe the Tabernacle of David, that was falne down, the Experience of a
few yeares, I no way doubt, will abundantly reveale and manifest. That in the vicissitude of
all things, given them by the mysterious and dreadful wheeles of providence, your good
things also, (as every thing else that is pleasant and desirable, or given of God unto
the Sons of men hath done) have fallen into the possession and disposal of men, some
enemies, others utterly useless, and unfruitful to the Lord in their generations, cannot
be denyed: But what is there in his waies, or worship, in his workes, or word, that God hath
not, at some season or other, delivered into the power of the men of the world, though they
have abused and perverted them to their own destruction? Neither is there any other use of
this Consideration, but only to informe them of the Obligations they lye under, to a due and
zealous improvement of them, to whose Trust and Cate the Lord committe any of his mer∣cyes,
when he rescues them from the Captivity, under which they have been detained, by un∣godly
men. This is now your lot, and condition, in reference to many who for sundry generati∣ons,
possessed those places, and advantages of eminent service for the house of our God, which

you now enjoy. What may justly be the Expectation of God from you, under this signal dis∣pensation
of his goodness, what is the hope prayer, & expectation of very many that feare him,
concerning you, in this nation; what are the designes, desires, aimes, and endeavours of all sorts
of them, who beare ill will at whatsoever is comely, or praise worthy amongst us, you are
not ignorant. Whatever consideration at any time or season, may seem to have had an ef∣ficacy
upon the minds and wills of men, under the like Sacrament, and designement to the ser∣vice
of truth with your selves, to incite and provoke them to a singularly industrious and
faithful discharge of their duty, is eminently pressing upon you also; and you are made a spec∣tacle
to men and Angells, as to the acquitment of your selves. The whole of your imploy∣ment,
I confess, both in the General intendment of it, for the promoting and diffusing of
light knowledge, and Truth in every kind whatever, and in the more special designe thereof,
for the defence, furtherance, and propagation of the Antient, inviolable, unchangeable truth
of the Gospel of God, is in the dayes wherein we live, exposed to a Contention with as much
opposition, contempt, scorne, hatred, and reproach, as ever any such undertaking was, in any
place in the world wherein men pretended to love light, more then darkness.
It is an hellish darkness, which the light of the Sun cannot expel. There is no ignorance
so full of Pride, folly and stubborness, as that which maintaines it selfe, in the midst of plenti∣ful
meanes of light and knowledge. He that is in the darke, when the light of the Sun is as
seven dayes, hath darkness in his eye, and how great is that darkness? Such is the Ignorance you
have to contend withal; stubborne, affected, prejudicate beyond expression; maintaining it's
darkness at noon-day, expresly refusing to attend to the Reason of things, as being that alone,
in the thoughts of those men, (if they may be so called) who are possessed with it, where∣with
the world is disturbed. From those who being under the power of this enthralment do
seem to repine at God; that they are not beasts, and clamorously traduce the more noble part
of that kind & offspring, whereof themselves are, which attempts do heighten, & improve the
difference between Creatures of an intellectual Race, and them, to whom their perishing
Composition gives the utmost Advancement; whose eternal seeds, and principles, are laid
by the hand of God in their respective beings, you will not I am sure think it much if you
meet with Oppositions. Those who are in any measure acquainted with the secret, trium∣phing
exaltations of wisdome and knowledge, against folly and ignorance; with the princi∣ples
and conditions, wherewith they advance themselves in their gloryings, even then, when
the precedency of (that which is bestial in this world) force and violence outwardly beares
them down with insultation and contempt, will rather envie, then pity you in any contest
that on this foot of account, you can be engaged in. You are not the first, that have fought
with men, after the manner of Beasts; nor will be the last, who shall need to pray to be delivered
from absurd and unreasonable man, seeing all men have not faith.
Men of prophane & Atheistical spirits, who are ready to say, who is the Lord, what is the Al∣mighty
that we should feare him or his truth that we should regard it? whose Generation is of late
multiplied on the face of the earth, crying a Confederacy with them, who professing better
things, are yet fied with grievous indignations at the sacrifice that hath been made of their
Abominations before their eyes, by that Reformation of this place, wherein you have been
instrumental, are a continual goad on the other side, and would quickly be a sword in your
very bowels, were not He, that is higher then the highest, your dwelling place, and refuge in
your Generation. These are they upon whom God having poured contempt, and stain'd their
glory, who instead of accepting of his dispensations, are filled with wrath, and labour to make
then drink of the cup, which hath been offered to themselves. With their reproaches, sleigh∣tings,
undervaluations, slanders, do your worth, diligence, integrity, labours, contend, from
one end: of this earth to the other. He that hath delivered, doth deliver, and in him we trust, that
he will deliver.
What other oppositions you do meet, or in your progress, may meet withal, I shall not
mention: but waite with patience on him, who gives men Repentance, and chang of Heart
to the Acknowledgment of the things, that are of him. This in the midst of all, hath hi∣therto
been a cause of great rejoyoing, that God hath graciously kept off ravenous wolves,
from entring into your flocks, where are so many tender lambes, and hath not suffered men to
arise from amongst your selves speaking perverse things, & drawing away disciples after them;
but as he hath given you, ac obey from your heart that forme of doctrine, which hath been delivered
unto you, so He hath preserv'd th faith amongst you, which was once delivered to the Saints.
Your peculiar designation to the service of the Gospel, and defence of the Truth thereof,
your Abilities for that works, your abiding in it, notwithstanding the opposition you meet
 in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, are as I sayd before, my Incourage∣ments

in this address unto you; wherein I shall crave leave a little further to communicate
my thoughts unto you as to the matter in hand. Next to the Son of his love who is the Truth,
the greatest and most eminent gift, that God hath bestowed on the Sons of men, and com∣municated
to them, is his Truth revealed in his word. The knowledge of him, his mind and
will, according to the discovery which he hath made of himselfe, from his own bosome, ha∣ving
magnified his word, above all his name. The importance hereof, as to the eternal Concern∣ments
of the Sons of men, either in ignorance refusing and resisting, or accepting and embra∣cing
of it, is that which is owned, and lyes as the bottome and foundation of all, that we any
way engage our selves into, in this world: wherein we differ from them, whose hope perisheth
with them. Unto an enquiry after, and entertainment of this divine and sacred depositum,
hath God designed the fruit and labour of that, wherein we retaine the resemblance of him;
which whilest we have our being, nothing can abolish. The mind of man, and divine truth,
are the two most eminent Excellencies, wherewith the Lord hath adorned this lower part of
his Creation: which when they correspond, and are brought into conformity with each other,
the mind being changed into the Image of Truth, there is glory added to glory, and the whole
rendred exceeding glorious. By what sutableness and proportion in the things themselves,
(that is between Truth and the mind of man,) as we are men, by what Almighty secret and
irresistible power, as we are corrupted men, our minds being full of darkness and folly, this is
wrought, is not my business now to discuss. This is on all hands confessed: that setting aside
the consideration of the eternal issues of things, every mistake of divine Truth, every opposi∣tion
to it, or rejection of it, or any part of it, is so farre, a chaining up of the mind, under
the power of darkness, from a progress towards that perfection which it is capable of. It is
Truth alone that Capacitates any soule to give glory to God, or to be truly useful to them
who are partakers of flesh and blood with him: without being some way serviceable to which
end, there is nothing short of the fulness of wrath, that can be judged so miserable as the
Life of a man. Easily so much might be delivered on this account, as to evince the dread
of that judgment, whereto some men in the infallibly wise counsel of God are doomed, even
to the laying out of the labour and travel of their minds, to spend their dayes and strength in
sore labour, in making opposition to this Truth of God. Especially is the sadness of this Con∣sideration
encreased, in reference to them, who upon any account what ever, do beare forth
themselves, and are looked upon by others, as Guides of the blind, as Lights to them that sit
in darkness, as the Instuctours of the foolish, & teachers of Babes. For a man to set himselfe, or
to be set by others, in a way wherein are many turnings & cross pathes, some of them leading
and tending to places of innumerabe troubles, and perhaps death and slaughter, undertaking
to be a guide to direct them that travel towards the place of their intendments, where they
would be, and where they shall meet with rest, for such an one I say, to take hold of every one
that passeth by, and pretending himselfe to be exceeding skilful, in all the windings and tur∣nings
of those wayes, and pathes, and to stand there on purpose to give direction, if He shall,
withal his skill and Rhetorick, divert them out of the path wherein they have perhaps safly
set out, and to guide them into those by wayes, which will certainly lead them into snares, and
troubles, if not to death it selfe, can he spend his time, labour and strength, in an imployment
more to be abhorred? or can he designe any thing more desperately mischievous to them,
whose good and welfare he is bound and promiseth to seek and promote! Is any man's con∣dition
under heaven more to be lamented, or is any man's imployment more perilous then
such an ones, who being not only endowed with a mind and understanding, capable of the
Truth, and receiving impressions of the will of God, but also with distinguishing Abilities
and Enlargements for the receiving of greater measures of Truth, then others, and the more
effectual improvment of what he doth so receive, shall labour night and day, dispending the
richest treasure and furnishment of his bule, for the rooting out, defacing, and destruction of
the Truth, for the turning men out of the way, and pathes that lead to rest and peace? I ne∣ver
think of the uncomfortable drudgery, which men give up themselves unto, in laying the
hay and stubble of their vaine and false Conceptions, upon the foundation, and heaping up the
fruit of their soules, to make the fire that consumes them, the more fierce and severe, but it
forces compassionate thoughts of that sad Condition, whereto man-kind hath cast it selfe, by
it's Aposacy from God. And yet there is not any thing in the world, that men more willingly,
with more delight and greediness, consecrate the flowre of their Strength and Abilities unto,
then this, of promoting the delsions of their own minds, in opposition to The truth, & waies
of God. It is a thing of obvious observation and dayly experience, that if by any meanes
what ever, any one closeth with some new, and by opinion, off from the faith delivered to, and
received by the generality of the Saints, that be it a thing of never so small concernment in

our walking with God, in Gospel obedience, and in love without dissimulation one towards
another, yet) instantly more weight is layd upon it, more paines laid out about it, and zeale
dispended for it's supportment, and propagation, then about all other most necessary points
of Christian Religion. Have we not a deplorable cloud of Examples, of men contending
about some Circumstance or other, in the Administration of an ordinance, biting and devou∣ing
all that stand in their way, roving up and down to gaine Proselytes, unto their perswa∣sion,
and in the meane time, utterly ignorant or negligent of the great doctrines and com∣mands
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which are as in him, the head & Life of Soules? How many
a man seemes to have no manner of Religion at all, but some one errour. That is his God, his
Christ, his worship; that he preaches, that he discourseth of, that he labours to propagate: un∣til
by the righteous judgment of God it comes to pass that such men in all other things wi∣ther,
& dye away; all the sap and vigour of their spirits, feeding that one monstrous excrescen∣cy,
which they grow up dayly into. Desire of emerging and being notable in the world, e∣steem
and respect in the hearts and mouthes of them, whom peculiarly they draw after
them, with the like unworthy aimes of selfe advancement, may without evill surmizing (when
such attempts are, (as in too many,) accompanied with irregularity in Conversation) be suppo∣sed
to be Advantages given into the hands of the envious man, to make use of them for the sow∣ing
of his tares, in the field of the poor seduced world.
That this procedure is also furthered by the burdensomeness of sound doctrine unto the
generality of men, who having itching eares, as farre as they care for these things, do spend
their time in Religion, in nothing else, but either to tell, or to heare some new thing, cannot be
denyed. Besides to defend, improve, give and adde new light, unto old truths (a worke which
hath so abundantly and excellently been labour'd in, by so many worthies of Christ, especially
since the Reformation) in any eminent manner, so as to bring praise and repute unto the un∣dertakers
(which whether men will confess or no, it is evident that too many are enslaved un∣to)
is no easy taske: and for the most part of what is done that way, you may say, Quis leget
haec? The world (sayes every one) is burden'd with discourses of this nature. How many have
we in our dayes, who might have gone to the grave in silence among the residue of their bre∣thren,
and their names have remained for a season in the voisinage, where they might have
done God the service required of them in their generation, would they have kept themselves
in the forme of wholsome words and sound doctrine; that have now delivered their names into
the mouthes of all men, by engageing into some singular opinions, though perhaps raked out
of the ashes of Popery, Socinianisme, or some such fruitful heap of errour, and false notions of
the things of God?
I desire not to judge before the time; the day will manifest all things: and the hidden secrets
of the hearts of men, shall by it be layed open: when all the wais, causes, and occasions of
their deceiving, and being deceived, shall be brought to light, and every man according to his
work shall have praise of God. Only I say as to the present state of things, this is evident
(not to speake of those locusts from the bottomless pit, that professedly oppose their
strength, to all that is of God, his name, word, worship or truth, will, and commands, rasing the
foundation of all hopes of eternity; nor of Him, and His Associates, who exalteth himselfe above
 but is called God, being full of names of blasphemy, sealed up to destruction) very many
ongst our selves, of whom we hoped better things, do, some in greater, some in lesser mat∣ters
give up themselves to that unhappy labour we before mentioned, of opposing the truths
of God, and exalting their own darkness, in the roome of his glorious light.
Vtjugulent homines surgunt de nocte latrones;
Vt teipsum serves non expergisceris-
Reverend Brethren! if other men can rise early, go to bd late, and eate the bread of care∣fulness,
spend their lives and strength to do their own work, and propagate their own
conceptions, under a pretence of doing the work of God: if the envious man watcheth
all night and waites all advantages to sow his tares, how will you be able to lift up your
hands with joy, and behold your Masters face with boldness at his coming, if having
received such eminent Abilities, endowments, and furnishments from him, for his ser∣vice,
and the service of his sheep and lambs, as you have done, you gird not up the loines
of your minds, and lay not out your strength to the uttermost, for the weeding out of the field
and vineyard of the Lord every plant which our heavenly Father hath not planted, and for feed∣ing
the flock of Christ with sincere milk, and strong meat according as they are able to beare▪
what you have received, more then others, is of free grace, which is God's way of dealing
with them, on whom he layes the most unconquerable, and indespensable obligation unto
service. Flesh and blood hath not revealed unto you the truth of God, which you do profess

but our Father which is in heaven; you do not upon any endeavour of your own, differ from
them who are given up to the sore Judgment and ever to be bewailed condition before mentio∣ned.
It hath not been from your own endeavours or watchfulness, that you have been hi∣therto
preserved under the hour of temptation; which is come to try the men that live upon the face
of the earth. It is not of your selves, that you are not industriously disturbing your own soules
and others, with this, or that entrenchment upon the doctrine of the Gospel, and the free
Grace of God in Jesus Christ, which not a few pride themselves in, with the contempt of all
otherwise minded. And doth not the present state of things, require the full disbursing of
all, that you have freely received for the glory of him, from whom you have received it? You
are persons who not only as Doctours & Teachers in an Vniversity, have a large, distinct, disci∣plinary
knowledge of Divinity; but also such as to whom the Son of God is come, and hath given
an understanding to know him that is true: into whose hearts God hath shined to give the light of
the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ; & therefore may say, what shall we render to
the Lord? how shall we serve him in any way answerable to the grace we have received? I
speak not (this the Lord knowes it, before whom I stand) with Reflection on any, as though I
judged them neglecters of the duty incumbent on them. Every one of us, must give an ac∣count
of himselfe to the Lord. The dayly paines, labour and travaile of many of you, in the
work of the Gospel, the dilegence and codeavours of others in promoting other useful litera∣ture,
is known unto all. Only the considerations of my own present undertaking, joyn'd
with a sense of mine own insufficiency for this, or any other labour of this kind, and of your
larger furnishments with abilities of all sorts, press me to this stirring up of your remembrance,
to contend for the faith so much opposed and perverted: Not that I would press, for the need∣less
multiplying of bookes, (whose plenty is the general customary complaint of all men ver∣sed
in them) unless necessity call thereto; Scribimus indocti, docti{que}—But that serious thoughts
may be continually dwelling in you, to lay out your selves to obviate the spreading of any
errour what ever, or the destruction of any already propagated; by such waies and meanes,
as the providence of God, and the circumstances of the matter it selfe shall call you out unto,
is in the desire of my soule.
Something you will find in this kind attempted, by the weakest of your number, in this
ensuing Treatise. The matter of it, I know will have your Approbation, and that because it
hath his, whom you serve. For the manner of handling it, it is humbly given up to his grace
and mercy, and freely left to your Christian Judgments: The general concernments of this
business are so known to all, that I shall by no meanes burden you with a repetition of them.
The attempt made by Mr Goodwin against the truth here asserted, was by all men judged so
considerable (especially the truth opposed, having a more practical influence into the walking
of the Saints with God, then any Other by him assaulted, and the defending of it, giving more
advantage into an inquiry after the mind of God, as delivered in innumerable places of Scri∣pture,
then any of the rest opposed) as that a removal of his Exceptions to our Arguments,
and an Answer to his Objections, was judged necessary by all. Other reasons manifesting this
endeavour to be in order and in season, I have further communicated in the entrance of the
Treatise it selfe. In my addresses to the work, I could by no meanes content my selfe, with
a mere discussing of what was produced by my Adversary. For he having kept himselfe
for the most part, within the compass of the Synodal writings of the Remonstrts, which are
already most clearly and solidly answered, (by one especially, renowned ) to have
tyed my selfe unto a contest with him, had been merely actum agere, without promoting the
cause I had undertaken in the least. As I account it by no meanes an ingenuous proceeding,
for men to beare up their own names, by standing upon the shoulders of others, to deport
themselves Authours, when indeed they are  Collectours, and Translatours; So I am very
remote from being so far in love with this way of handling controversies in Divinity, as to
think it necessary to multiply books of the same matter, without some considerable addition
of Light, and strength to the Cause, whose protection and promotion is undertaken. On this
consideration, besides incident discourses, which I hope through the Grace of him, that sup∣plyed
seed to the sower, may be of use and have an encrease amongst the Saints of God; I have
made it my aime (and what therein I have attained, is with all submission of mind and judg∣ment
cast before the thoughts of men, whose senses are exercised to discerne good and evill) to
place each Argument insisted on, upon it's own proper basis and foundation: to Resolve every
Reason and Medium whereby I have proceeded, into it's own principles: discovering the
fountaine and well-head of all the streames that run in the field of this contest, as also to give
some clearings and evidence, to our Conclusions from the several Texts of Scripture discussed,
by discovering the Reason of them, and intent of God in them. Some Arguments there

are, and sundry Texts of Scripture, that are usually produced, and urged in the defence of the
cause under consideration, that I have not insisted on: nor vindicated from the exceptions of
the Adversaries. Not that I judge them indefensible against their most cunning, or most fu∣rious
assaults, and so slighted what I could not hold, for indeed I know not any one Text of scri∣pture,
commonly used for this end, nor any Argument by any sober man framed to the same
purpose, that is not capable of an easy and faire vindication: but meerly because they fell not
in regularly, in the method I had proposed to my selfe, nor would so do, unless I had gone
forth to the issue of my first intendment, and had handled the abode of Believers with God
at large, from it's principles and causes, as I had done, that part of our doctrine which con∣cernes
the Continuance of the love of God with, and unto them; which the growth of the
Treatise under my hand, would not give me leave to do. What hath been, or may yet fur∣ther
be done, by others who have made, or shall make it their business, to draw the saw of this
Controversy, to and fro which Mr. Goodwin, I hope will give satisfaction, as in other things,
so in the particulars by me omitted. As to what I have to speak, or at least think it convenient
to speak, concerning him, with whom in this discourse I have much to do, and the manner
of my dealing with him, being a thing of personal Concernment, not having any influencing
Aspect on the merit of the cause, I shall, in not many words, absolve you of your trouble in
the Consideration thereof. My Adversary is a person, whom his worth, paines, diligence, and
opinions, and the contests, wherein on their account he hath publikely engaged, have delive∣red
from being the object of any ordinary thoughts, or expressions. Nothing not great, not
considerable, not some way eminent, is by any spoken of him, either consencing with him, or
dissenting from him. To interpose my Judgment in the crowd, on the one side or the other,
I know neither warrant, or suffcient cause: We all stand, or fall to our own masters; And
the fire will try all our workes. This only I shall crave Liberty to say; that whether from his
own genius, and acrimony of Spirit, or from the provocations of others, with whom he hath
had to do, many of his Polemical Treatises have been sprinkled with Satyrical Sarcasmes, and
contemptuous rebukes of the persons with whom he hath had to do. So that were I not re∣lieved
in my thoughts, by the consideration of those Exacerbations and exasperations of spi∣rit,
which upon other accounts, besides bare difference of opinion in religious things, have
fallen out in the dayes and seasons which have passed over us, all of them labouring to exert
something of themselves, in every undertaking of the persons brought under their power, I
should have been terly discouraged from any contests of this nature. Much indeed of his
irregularity in this kind, I cannot but ascribe to that prompt facility he hath, in putting abroad
every passion of his mind, and all his conceptions, not only decently clothed, with language
of a full and choice significancy, but also trim'd and adorn'd with all manner of signal im∣provements,
that may render it keen or pleasant according to his intendment or desire, What
the Latine Lyrick said of the Grecian Poet may be applyed to him.
Monte decurrens velt amnis, imbres
Quem super notas aluêre rìpas,
Fervet, immensus{que} ruit profundo
Pindarus ore.
And he is thereby plainly possessed of not a few advantages. It is true that when the proof
of his opinion by Argument, and the orderly pursuit of it is incumbent on him, (a course of
all other wherein  soonest faileth,) the medium he useth, and insisteth on, receiveth not the
least contribution of real strength from any dress of words, and Expressions wherewith it is
adorned and accompanied: yet it cannot be denyed, but that his Allegorical amplifications,
illustrations and exaggerations of the things he would insinuate, take great impressions upon
the minds of them, who are in any measure intangled with the seeming probabilities, which
are painted over his Arguments, by their sophistry, and pretence of Truh. The Apostle giving
that Caution to the Collossians that they should take heed, ,
manifesteth the prevalencie of false reasonings when in Conjunction with Rhetorical per∣swasions.
The great store also of words and expressions, which for all occasions he hath lying
by him, are of no little use to him, when being pressed with any Arguments, or testimonies of
Scripture, and being not able to evade, he is forc't to raise a cloud of them, wherewith after
he hath a while darkned the wisdome and Councel of that, wherewith he hath to do, he in∣sensibly
slipps out of the cord, wherewith he appeared to have been detained, and triumphes
as in a perfect Conquest, when only an unarticulate sound hath been given by his trumpet,
but the charge of his Adversaries not once received or repelled. But not any where, doth
he more industriously hoist up, and spread the sailes of his luxurient Eloquence, then when he
aimes to render the opinion of his adversaries to be, monstrum orendum, informe ingens, cui

lumen ademptum, a dark, dismal, uncomfortable, fruitless, death-procuring doctrine; such as it is marvei∣lous,
that ever any poor soul should embrace or choose for a Companion or guide, in it's pilgrimage
towards heaven. Rolling through this feild, his expressions swell over all bounds and limits; meta∣phors,
similitudes, parables, all help on the current: though the streames of it being shallow and wide, a
little opposition easily turnes it for the most part aside; a noise it makes indeed, with a goodly shew
and appearance.
Herculeâ non mole minor—Agylleus
Sed non ille rigor, patrium{que} in corpore robur.
Luxuriant artus, effusa{que} sanguins laxo
Membra natant—
This, (as I said,) prompts (I feare) the learned person of whom we speak, to deale so harshly with
some of them with whom he hath to do. And it is still feared, that
—parata tollit cornua;
Qualis Lycambae spretus infido Gener,
Aut acer hostis Bupalo.
It might indeed be the more excusable, if evident provocation were alwaies ready at hand to be
charged with the blame of this procedure, if he said only
An si quis aro dente me petiverit
Multus ut slebo puer?
But for a man to warme himselfe, by casting about his own pen, until it be so filled with indigna∣tion
and scorne, as to blur every page and almost every line, is a course that will never promote the
praise, nor adorne the Truth of God. For what remaines concerning him; do illi ingenium, do eloquen∣tiam,
& industriam; fidem, & veritatem utinam colnisset.
The Course & Condition of my procedure with him, whether it be such as becometh Christian mo∣desty,
and sobriety, with an allowance of those ingredients of zeal, in contending for the trut, hwhich
in such cases the Holy Ghost gives a command for, is referred to the Judgment of all, who are con∣cerned,
and account themselves so, in the things of God. As to any bitterness of expression, personal
reflections by application of Satyrical invectives, I know nothing by my selfe, and yet I dare not ac∣count,
that I am hereby justified. The calme and indifferent Reader, not sensible of those commotions,
which the discovery of Sophistical evasions, pressing of inconsequent consequences, bold Assertions &c:
will sometimes raise in the most candid and ingenuous mind, may (and especially if he be an observer
of failings in that kind) espie once and againe, some signes and appearances of such exasperations as
ought to have been allayed with a spirit of meekness, before the thoughts that stirred them up, had
been turned out of doores, in the expressions observed. Although I am not conscious of the delivery of
my selfe in any termes, intimating a Captivitie under the power of such a snare for a moment, yet what
shall to the Christian Reader occurre of such a seeming tendency, I humbly refer it to his judgment,
being content to suffer loss in any hay or stubble what ever, that I may have layd upon the foundation
of truth, which I am sure is firmly fixed by God himselfe, in the business in hand.
For what further concernes my manner of dealing in this Argument, I have only a few things to
mention, (Reverend Brethren) and you will be discharged of the trouble of this prefatory address un∣to
you. The matter in hand I hope you will find attended and pursued, without either Iocular or histo∣rical
diversions, which are judged meet by some to retaine the spirits, and intice the minds of the Rea∣ders,
which are apt to faint and grow weary, if alwaies bent to the consideration of things weighty
and serious. With you, who are continually exercised with severer thoughts and studies, then the
most of men can immix themselves withal, such a condescention to the vanity of men minds,
and lightness of their spirits, I am sure can find no approbation. And as for them who make it their bu∣siness,
to run through books of a Polemical nature, in what subject soever, in pursuit of what is personal,
ridiculous, invective, beating every Chapter, and Section, to find only what ought not to be there, and
recoyling in their spirits, upon the appearance of that which is serious, and pressing to the cause in hand,
I suppose you judge them not worthy to be attended to, with such an imposition upon the time and
diligence of those who sincrely seek the Truth in love, as the satisfying of their vaine humour would
require. It is indeed of sad consideration to see, how some learned men (forgetting the loss of preci∣ous
houres, wherewith they punish their Readers thereby) in discourses of this naturedo, offend against
their professed intendments, by perpetual diversions in long personal Hranges, delighting some
for a moment, instructing none, in the mattter inquired into. Some parts of this Treatise you may
perhaps judge not so closely, & scholastically argumentative, as the regular lawes of an accurate dispu∣tation
would require. In the same judgment with you, is the Authour: where yet he supposes himselfe
not without just Apologie, and that such, as renders his way of procedure not blame worthy: where∣as
otherwise he should not think any excuse sufficient to expate such an errour. He is worthily blam∣med,
who had not rather chuse to want a fault, then an excuse. The truth is, neither would the matter

treated of, nor the persons, for whose sakes cheifly this labour was undertaken, admit of an accurate
scholastical procedure in all parts of the Treatise. The doctrine asserted, and the errour opposed, are
the concernments of the common people of Christianity. Arminianisme is crept into the bodies of
sundry congregations, and the weaker men are, who entertaine it, the more gross and carnal are their
notions, and Conceptions in, and about it. Pelagius himselfe was never so injurious to the grace of
God, as some amongst us. Now the souls of men, whose good is sought in this work, are no less pre∣cious
in the sight of God, though they are unacquainted with Philosophical termes, and wayes of ar∣guing,
than the soules of the most learned. Besides, that which we account our wisedome, and lear∣ning
may, if too rigoously attended, be our folly: when we think to sharpen the reason of the Scripture,
we may straighten the Efficacy of the spirit of it. It is oftentimes more effectual in it's own liberty, then
when restrained to our methods of arguing. And the weapons of it keener in their own soft breathings,
then when sharpned in the forge of Aristotle. There is a way of perswasion and conviction in the Scri∣ptures,
that is more divine & sublime, then to be reduced to any Rules of Art that men can reach unto.
God in his word, instructs men to make them wise unto salvation. Syllogismes are not (doubtless)
the only way of making men wise with humane wisedome, much less divine: Some Testimonies, on
this account, are left at their own liberty, improved only by Explanation, that they might lose nothing
of their owne strength, seeing no other can be added to them: Where the corrupt Philosophy, or sophi∣stical
arguings, or indeed regular syllotical proceedings of the Adversaries, have rendred a more
close Logical way of proceeding necessary, I hope your favourable judgments, will not find cause to
complaine of the want thereof. Whatever is amiss, what ever is defective, what ever upon any account,
cometh short of desire or expectation, as I know none in the world more able to discerne, and find out,
then your selves, so there are none from whom I can expect, and justly promise my selfe, a more easy &
candid Censure, a more free and general pardon, a more favourable Acceptation of this endeavour for
the service of the Truth, then from you. Besides that personal Amity, and respect, which God by his
providence hath given me (one altogether unworthy of such an allay of common perplexities in
his pilgrimage) with you, and amongst you, besides that readiness and ingenuous promptness of mind,
unto condescention, and candid reception of labours in this kind, which your own great worth, and
abilities furnish you withal, exempting you, and lifting you above that Pedantick severity, and humour
of censure, which posseth Sciolists, & men corrupted with a desire of emerging in the repute of others.
You know full well, in what streights, under what diversions, imployments, business of sundry natures
incumbent on me, from the Relations wherein I stand, in the University, and on sundry other accounts,
this work hath been carried on. The truth is, no small portion of it, owes it's rise to Journeyes, and such
like avocations from my ordinary course of studies, and imployments, with some spare houres, for the
most part in time of absence, from all books and asisstances of that nature whatever. Not longer to
be burthensome unto you, with things of no greater concernment, then what may have respect to one every way so unworthy as my selfe, what is of the seed which God hath graciously supplyed, I am sure
will find acceptance with you; and what is of it's worthless Author, or that I have added, I am fully
content may be consumed by the fire, that tryes our workes of what sort they are.
My dayly prayer (Honoured Brethren) shall be on your behalfe, that in the dayes, wherein we see
so many fall from the truth, & oppose it, on the one hand; a great indifferency as to the things of God,
leading Captive so many on the other, so few remaining, made useful to God in their generations, by
a conjunction of zeale for the truth, and ability unto it's defence, and those for the most part so closely
engaged in, and their hands so filled, with the work of publique beseeching Men to be reconciled to God in
Christ, and building up of them, who are called in their most holy faith; You may receive helpe from a∣bove,
and encouragement to engage you by all meanes possible, to spread abroad a savour of the Gos∣pel
of Jesus Christ, & to labour continually that the truths of God, (for whose defence you are parti∣cularly
appointed) may not be cast down, nor trampled on under the feet of men of corrupt minds, ly∣ing
in wait to deceive, alluring & beguiling unstable soules, with enticing words of humane wisedome,
or any glorious shew and pretence whatever, turning them from the simplicity of the Gospel, and the
truth as it is in Jesus: that you may not faint, nor waxe weary, notwithstanding all the opposition, con∣tempt,
scorne, you do, or may meet withal; nor ever be turned aside to corrupt Dalliances with errour,
and falshood, as is the manner of some, who yet would be accounted sound in the faith; but keeping
close to the forme of wholesome words, & answering the mould of Gospel doctrin, whereinto you have
been cast, may shine as Lights, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; knowing, that it is but
yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come, & will not tarry; yea come Lord Jesus, come &c.
So prayes
