SIR,
HAving when I was at
Paris last Spring, met
with a little Book of Letters,
call'd L' Intregue de Philan∣der
& Silvia, I had a par∣ticular
fancy, besides my
inclinations to translate 'em
into English, which I have
done as faithfully as I cou'd,
only where he speaks of the
ingratitude of Caesario to the
King, I have added a word
or two to his Character that
might render it a little more
parallel to that of a modern

Prince in our Age; for the
rest I have kept close to the
French.
The Letters art soft and
amorous, and besides my
esteem and obligation to
you, I think it no where so
proper to address so much
ender passion, as to a man
whom Heaven and Nature
has so well form'd both for
dispencing and receiving of
Love as your self, you ha∣ving
all in your person that
is acceptable to women and
desir'd by men, and when
you please can make your
self as absolutely the joy
of the one as the envy of

the other; to this is join'd
a Vertue, such as I believe
the World has rarely pro∣duc'd
in a Man of your
Youth, Fortune and Ad∣vantages;
you have all the
power of the ebauchery
of the Age, without the
will, you early saw the
Follies of the Town, and
the greatness of your mind
disdaining that common
Road of living, shun'd the
foppish practice; your well-judging
pride chose rather
to be singular, and sullen∣ly
retire, than heard with
that noisie Crowd, that e∣ternally
fit out business e∣nough

to stock the Town
with Wit and Lampoons,
and the Stage with Fops,
Fools and Cowards: if I
might give my real judg∣ment,
you are above flat∣tery,
and one can almost
say no good or generous
thing that one cannot justi∣fie
in you, no Vertue you
cannot lay a claim to; ma∣ny
your modesty hides
from the World, and ma∣ny
more you have which
envy will not confess; for
that just value you set up∣on
your self by shunning
the publick haunts, Cabals
and Conversations of the

Town, in spight of all your
Wit and Goodness gives oc∣casion
for malice to revenge
it self on you a thousand
little ways; witness a late
mistaken story of an Amour
of yours, so often urg'd
with heat, and told so much
to your disadvantage, by
those who have not the happiness
of knowing your true
principles of honour, your
real good nature, your com∣mon
justice, or sense of Hu∣manity,
to be such, as not
to be capable of so base, sil∣ly
and unmanly a practice,
and so needless and poor a
design: For my part, Sir, I

am vain and proud of the
belief that I have the capaci∣ty
and honour to know and
understand your Soul, (did
I not too well the story also)
and am well assur'd it has
not a grain, not a thought
of so foolish a principle, so
unnecessary and dishonest:
and I dare affirm that since
the imposition of the late Po∣pish▪
Plot upon the Town,
there has not so ridiculous
and nonsensical a History past
for authentick with unthin∣king
man; but you shou'd
give 'em leave to rail, since
you have so vast advantages
above 'em.

Sir, I wou'd fain think
that in the Character of Phi∣lander
there is a great re∣semblance of your self as to
his Person, and that part of
his Soul that was possest with
Love: he was a French Whigg,
'tis true, and a most appa∣rent
Traytor, and there, 
confess, the comparison fails
extremely; for sure no man
was ever so incorrigible so
hardned in Torism as your
self, so fearless, so bold, so
resolute, and confirm'd in
Loyalty; in the height of
all dangers and threatnings,
in the blessed Age of swea∣ring,
and the hopeful Reign

of evidences, you undaun∣ed
held forth for the royal
cause, with such force of rea∣son
and undeniable sense as
those that were not conver∣ted,
at least were startled;
and I shall never forget the
happy things I have heard
you say on that glorious
subject, with a zeal so fer∣vent,
yet so modest and gen∣tle
your argument, so solid,
just, so generous and so ve∣ry
hearty, as has begot you
applauses and blessing round
the board: a thousand in∣stances,
a History I cou'd
wrie of your discourses and
acts of Loyalty; but that

even your Enemies allow,
and I will spare it here, and
only say you are an honour
and a credit to the Cause
that's proud to own you.
In this you are far distan
to my amorous Hero; but at
least for my own satisfaction,
and that I may believe Sil∣via
truly happy, give me
leave to fansie him such a
person as your self, and then
I cannot fail of fansying him
too, speaking at the fee: of
Silvia, pleading his right of
love with the same softness
in his eyes and voice, as you
can do when you design
to conquer; whene'er you

spread your nets for Game,
you need but look abroad,
fix and resolve, though you,
unlike the forward youth of
this Age, so nicely pursue
the quarry; it is not all, or
any Game you fly at, not e∣very
Bird that comes to net
can please your delicate appe∣tite;
though you are young
as new desire, as beautiful
as light, as amorous as a
God, and wanton as a Cu∣pid,
that smiles, and shoots,
and plays, and mischiefs all
his fond hours away: Pray
Heaven you be not reserv'd
like our Hero for some Si∣ster,
'tis an ill sign when so

much beauty passes daily un∣regarded,
that your love is
reserved to an end as mali∣cious
as that of our Philan∣der's.
Perhaps you'll be out of
hmour, and cry, why the
Devil did'st thou dedicate the
Letters of a Whigg to me
 but to make you amends▪
Sir, pray take notice Silvia
is true Tory in every part,
if but to love a Whigg be not
crime enough in your opini∣on
to pall your appetite, and
for which even her youth
and beauty cannot make an
attonement; commodity,
which rarely fails in the

Trade of love, though ne∣ver
was so low a Market for
beauty of both Sexes, yet
he that's fortified and stor'd
like happy you, need never
fear to find his price; for
wit and good humour bear
still a rate, and have an in∣trinsick
value, while the o∣ther
is rated by opinion and
is at best but a curious pict∣ure,
where one and the
same dull silent Charms
make up the day, while the
other is always new, and
(to use your own expression)
is a Book where one turns o∣ver
a new leaf every minute,
and finds something diver∣ting,

in eternal new discove∣ries;
it elevates ones Spirits,
charms the Soul, and im∣proves
ones stock; for eve∣ry
one has a longer date of
hearing than seeing, and the
eyes are sooner satiated than
the ear; therefore do not
depend too much on beauty,
'tis but a half conquest
you will make when you
shew the Man only, you
must prove him too; give
the soft Sex a sight of your
fine Mind as well as your
fine Person; but you are a
lazy Lover, and ly fallow
for want of industry, you
rust your stock of hoaded

love, while you gaze only
and return a single sigher;
believe me, Friend, if you
continue to fight at that sin∣gle
weapon, there will be no
great store of wounds given
or taken on either side; you
must speak and write if you
wou'd be happy, since you
can do it so infinitely to
purpose; who can be hap∣py
without Love? for me,
I never numbred those dull
days amongst those of my
life, in which I had not my
Soul fill'd with that soft pas∣sion;
to Love! why 'tis the
only secret in nature that
restores Life, to all the feli∣cities

and charms of living;
and to me there seems no
thing so strange, as to see
people walk about, laugh,
do the acts of Life, and
impertinently trouble the
world without knowing a∣ny
thing of that soft, that
noble passion, or without
so much as having an intreague,
or an amusement,
(as the French call it) with
any dear she, no real Love
or Cocettre; perhaps these
Letters may have the good
fortune to rouse and make
you look into your heart,
turn o're your store and la∣vish
out a little to divert the

toils of life; you us'd to say
that even the fatigues of love
had a vast pleasure in 'em;
Philander was of your mind,
and I (who advise you like
that friend you have ho∣nour'd
me with the title of)
have even preserv'd all the
torments of love, before
dully living without it; live
then and love, thou gay,
thou glorious young-man,
whom Heav'n has blest with
all the sweets of life besides;
live then and love; and
what's an equal blessing,
ive and be belov'd, by
some dear Maid, as nobly
born as Silvia, as witty

and as gay and soft as she,
(to you, who know no o∣ther
want, no other bles∣sing)
this is the most ad∣vantageous
one he can wish
you who is,
Sir,
