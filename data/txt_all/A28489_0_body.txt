Madam,
THough You have, and I am sure may claim, a Maternal intrest in several hopefull, in∣dustrious and obedient Sons, the Delight, the Prop and Ho∣nour of your Age; Yet none of them hath been more experi∣mentally sensible of the adverse stroke of Fortune, (and thereby more apprehensive of the vari∣ous Miseries which attend man∣kinde, upon the stage of this World) then my self; If I should have penned mine own tragick story, it would have appeared sad enough; but cast∣ing
 mine Eye upon several works, worthy esteem, I found none more agreeable to most mens, especially mine own con∣dition, or any more fit for pub∣lick contemplation, in these lat∣ter ages then this, which is apt∣ly stiled (as I have found the world to be) a meer Theatre, where every man acts his part: And indeed I could find no way more fit to Vindicate my life from suspitions of Idleness, and the Aspersions of uncharitable Tongues, then to produce this Translation, as a witnesse of my reall desires and intentions to pass those too many spare hours, days, nay years (which God hath been pleased to inflict as a tryal) not in a vitious mispending,
 but rather in a modest, humble, and virtuous, contemplating, en∣joying and improving of time, which I conceive ought to be employed, first to Gods glory, secondly for the good of man∣kinde in general, and thirdly for purchasing present, private, good, and future blisse.
As for the subject, it is in o∣ther languages very learnedly set forth, and fear I have rather, ignorantly, abused then volun∣tarily misused it, having been bred a negotiating Merchant; And not an Industrious or judi∣cious Scholler, which am confi∣dent to your self, with all that know me (and I hope to those that know me not) will cause a favourable construction, for
 what errours may therein be committed.
Dear Madam though to your many extraordinary and more then common blessings and fa∣vours, I am not able to return any thing, but (what otherways Low) love, duty and obedience; yet let me request an acceptance of this small mite of my endea∣vours, upon which, It you are pleased but to cast a smile, I shal be joyful, and withal perswaded that having your judicious Ap∣probation, there will be no mo∣derate, or charitable person, but will accept the discourse, though they may not applaud the stile, of him, who now a ever he hath done, subscribes himself,
