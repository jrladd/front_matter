SIR,
MAy it please you, Your singular love to Lear∣ning, and vnparallel'd studious collecting, and preserving of venerable Antiquities in generall, and particularly of the An∣tique Coines and Medals of this (whilome) flourishing (now) forlorn Kingdom of England, idque magnis sumptibus, and my poor and vnworthy self being lately made known vnto your worthy Self, have induced and emboldned me to inscribe or dedicate this Book vn∣to you: It being a work that hath heretofore passed the Presse, more than once; but never so compleat, as now it is, it having my deceased learned Father Dr. Holland his many emendations and additions.

And albeit it is in a subject of Physick, De sanitate tuenda, and so out of your studious Element: Yet the ori∣ginall Verses are as pleasant as profitable to read, for all degrees of men; and no less, but more (for such as have not bin in Latio) in English than in Latin.
The Stock-fathers of this work in Verse, were The School or University of Salern; Inscribing, writing, and sending it to one of our famous English Kings, And in those very Verses (as I have heard my said venerable Father eft-soons say is couched the whole Body of Physick, Ad valetudinem conservandam, And the Comment vpon the same, in Verses, very profitable for the beter vnderstan∣ting of the Verses, was the work in Latine of the famous Physician Arnaldus de Villa nova, a man well known by his writing to all of th'Apollonian Art in Europe.
Vnto which Work, there is an Addition of Fishes, the more to illustrate the Work, not vnprofitable to read, and take notice of; as also some observations of a Noble Per∣sonage.
Now, Noble Sir, Pardon, I beseech you, of your innate goodnesse, my boldnesse herein; and vouchsafe or deigne the Patronage of it, which a victorious King (of famous memory) hath done to its Originall: In an assured (pre∣sumed) hope whereof most humbly taketh his leave, and subscribeth
