SIR,
IF Poetry be truly conceived
to carry some Divinity with
it; and Poets, on what Sub∣jects
soever their Fancies
have discoursed, have bin intitaled Divine,
as the Divine Mr. Spencer, the Divine Ron∣sard,
the Divine Ariosto; how much more
properly may they be esteemed to be Di∣vine,
who have made chast Love their
Argument, which is a fire descended frō
Heaven, and (habituall in its Action) is
alwayes ascending and aspiring to it:
This is that Love which Xenophon doth
distinguish from the sensuall, and doth
call it The heavenly Venus, and with this our
Poet being powerfully inspired hath brea∣thed

forth these happy raptures, to declare,
That Love and the Muses are so near of
kinne, that the greatest Poets are the grea∣test
Lovers.
And Sir, although there is no man a
more absolute master of his passions than
your self, and therefore you cannot be said
to be subjected unto Love, yet it shall be
no dishonor to you to acknowledge your
self to be a lover of the Muses. In this con∣fidence
I have made bold to tender unto
you these Poems, the work of a young
Gentleman of 19 years of Age, who had
he lived, might have been as well the
Wonder as the Delight of the Arts, and
been advanced by them amongst the
highest in the Temple of Fame. The
Myrtle and the Cypresse Groves, which
he made more innocent by his Love, shall
remember, and the musick of the Birds
shall teach every tree to repeat to one a∣nother
his chast complaint, and the flou∣rish
of the trees shall endeavour to raise
unto Heaven his name, which they shall

wear ingraved on their leaves. These are
onely his first flights, his first fruits, the
early flowers of his youth; flowers they
are, but so sweetly violent, that as their
Beauties doe arrest our eyes, so (I hope)
their perfume will continue through ma∣ny
Ages to testifie the Influence of your
protection, and the most gracefull re∣sentments
of him who is
Sir,
