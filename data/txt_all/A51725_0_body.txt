Most Honoured Lord,
I Should not have the boldnesse to present this booke unto your Lordship, if (besides the great service I owe you) the Argument of the Booke did not in∣vite me to it: for con∣sisting of Politique Discourses and consi∣derations of State; it is most fit to be pre∣sented to Counsellours of State; amongst which I knew not whom better to pre∣sent it to, then to your Lordship: and no

lesse then the Argument of the Booke, the Authour thereof invites me to it; for being a learned Lord of Jtaly, none more fit to entertaine him then some learned Lord of England; of which number this Kingdome affordeth none more eminent then your Lordship: I must not speake so much as I think, for offending the mode∣sty of your eare; but I may boldly speake so much as all the world sees; that nature and Art have joyned together, to make you perfect in your place, which is to be a faithfull Counsellour to the King, and a loving Patriot to your Countrey: for both which, if I should not my selfe acknowledge an obligation to you, I might worthily be thought, unworthy to be accounted, which I specially desire to be,
Your Lordships humble and devoted servant,
RICHARD WHITAKER.
