Dread SIR,
'TIS not a flattering Muse, appears before your Sovereign Throne; for she pays her devotion to Your Ma∣jesties Royal Person, rather than to Your Fortune. Her Theam is Your Princely MIND, exceeding the Pythagorean World-supporting Intelligence; by the Conduct of which Pilot Your Triumphant Argo, did at last overcome all dangerous Gulphs and Creeks, smoothly gliding into the harbour of a Fleece, far Richer than that of Colches. In a word, 'tis not the Hand-maid, but the Mi∣stress I adore, even Your Majesties All-conquering Genius, which by its Regular stedfastness, is able not only to Triumph over Fortune, but also to make it.

True it is, my Vein is shallow, not being embody'd in the more luxuriant Channel of Your British Parnassus; yet, since it breaths Devotion, I am apt (upon that score) to think, it shall not prove unwel∣com; because it will, though proceeding from the sandy and barren Pile, help (in some measure) to bear up, the Sovereign Ark of Your Majesties, unquestioned Grandeur. Perhaps. she cannot promise to this Divine Fabrick (for a support) a gold-streaming Hydaspes; yet she shall appear to flow as Loyally, as the Palm full of Water, pre∣sented unto mighty Cyrus, by you famous Persian Peasant; being poured out at the brink of Your twice-surrounding Ocean, by
Dread Sovereign,
