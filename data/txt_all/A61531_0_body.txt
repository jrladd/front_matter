Gentlemen,
IT is at Your Request, that I Publish this
Sermon, which You were Pleased to
think might be Usefull to others, as well as
to those who heard it. And I could not deny
the First Request that was made to me by the
Gentlemen of this Country, in which I have
found so much Civility and Kindness. I
thank God, I came hither with no other In∣tention
but to do as much Good as I could;
and I hope I shall always pursue that Design
with a sincere and vigorous Mind, as far
as I have Health and Opportunity. I thought
I could not do my Duty at this time, without
Representing the Evil and Mischief of some
very unseasonable Heats and Animosities,

among those who pretend to the same Com∣mon
Interest, as to Religion and Laws,
which are the most certain Standard of our
Publick Good; and none, but such as
are Enemies to it, can understand it other∣wise.
May God Almighty Bless this Country
and the Whole Nation, with a hearty Zeal
and Concernment for it.

Worcester,
Sept. 23▪
1690.
