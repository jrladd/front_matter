Worthy Sir,
COnsulting with my self about this Libellulus, to whom I should De∣dicate it, (I concluded) to make Choice of such a Person as might e of Spotlesse Innocency; so that in his captious Age, none should dare to harge him with the least Offence, in ord, or Deed: For, justly fearing too y Faults might be found in the Work  self, I desired to make some amends,  Dedicating it to one free from Excep∣on, (and the rather to your self, Sir) be∣cause







I have received more Encourage∣ment from you alone, than all men living besides. And were I not confident, that you would somewhat bear with my Faults, I durst not have Entituled you to this my Worthlesse Labour. I flourish, as if I would say something, whereas I am in∣deed meerly Ignorant, and acknowledge all Faults to be my own Weaknesse, in undertaking so high, and pithy a Busi∣nesse: Yet would I endeavour to shew forth what God, out of his own Free Grace, hath bestowed upon,
Sir,
