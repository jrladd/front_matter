IT pleased you (RIGHT worthy LADY) hereto∣fore, to affoord this little Treatise kinde allowance, to enter vnder your Roofe, and to accept it, as a friendlesse Pilgrime, committed to your shelter & pro∣tection: and such hath beene the opinion of your selfe, the Patro∣nes, touching the same, that many

others in imitation of your kinde acceptance of it, haue likewise fa∣uourably censured it, and friendly receiued it, not for his sake that sent it, to seeke friends, but for yours, I assure me, that shewed it and me friendship. And now the Booke (simple as it is) being dis∣persed into the hands of many, with the poore Title of A poore Mansrest, becomes to be more and more richly regarded: And there∣fore, I could doe no lesse, after this seauenth Impression, but reuiew it, and augment it, and recommed it again vnto your fauourable tui∣tion, nothing doubting, but the longer it passeth abroad in the worlds view, the more it shall in∣crease in your high commendati∣on, that will vouchsafe to coun∣tenance so poore a Guest.
