TWo thinges (most Gratious Soueraigne) among the rest of chifest regard, in terrene and humane affaires, were euer apprised at the highest value: Life, the present being: Fame and Reputation, the beautie and splendor theereof: The first giuing esse, aftr non esse, to the greatest earthlie Creature, the other maintaining in some sorte, a perptuall life, and glorious liuing, when we be dead.
Therefore, by how much the possessors of those dignities, be more popular, publique, and greater in number, State, or pre∣eminence: y so many degrees, vnworthily and trecherouslie to be depriued of them, is more iniurious, guilie of wickednesse, and obnoxious to Restitution.
Concerning the former; The late intended Conspiracy against the life of your Royall Maiestie, (the Life, Vnion, Rule, and Direction to these vnited Kingdomes) so many Nobles, and Per∣sons of esteeme, was so heinous impiety, that nothing which is holy can make it Legitimate; no pretence of Religion can be al∣leadged, to excuse it: God and heauen condemne it, Men and earth detest it: Innocents bewaile it, the Nocent and vnhappie Delinquents themselues, perceiuing how their Religion reproueth it, in repentance haue lamented it: Protestants exclaime against it, and your dutifull, Religious, and learned Catholikes, Priests, and others, which haue endured most for their profession, hold it in greatest horror, and make it a subiect of their grieuous sor∣row, that any of their profession should attempt so barbarous and vnnaturall cruelty, or practise any disobedience at all to your Highnesse.

 And will sweare, protest, promise, and performe to your Ma∣iesty, whatsoeuer Loyaltie, Obedience, and dutie is due from a subiect to his Temporall Prince, by the word of God, lawe of Nature, or hath bene vsed by the subiects of this Kingdome, to a∣ny your Pogenitos Christian, from the first to the last: acknow∣ledge and rendr to your honorable Counsaile, and all Magi∣strats in ciuil causes, so much Honor, Reuerence and Submis∣sion, and to all other Protestant subiects, like amitie and neigh∣bourlie affection, as if they were of the same Religion, which we prfesse.
Concerning the second, of publike reproache, and defamati∣on, (most worthy Prince) if it only concerned the Catholikes of this Nation, although it be no easie question to proue, that men in such matters, and at such times, are masters of their fame: yet they could be content to burie it in their graue of obliuion with so many miseris which they haue long susteined, for their holy faith; and to say with the Apostle, Maledicimur et benedicimus, persecu∣tionem patimur et sustinemu, blasphemamur et obsecramus: but when the Purgamenta huius mundi, and omnium peripsema, must be made the badge of all maintainers of that worshippe, and all be stiled sditious and traiterous Persons, quite contrarie to your High∣nesse often Assertions, and publique Proclamations; That all Catholike subiects to all forraigne Princes, your Confederates, must weare that Liuerie, and their Soueraignes be attended with such seruants; All Catholike schooles termed Seminaries of rebel∣lions: and so directly not only the reputations of all those Vni∣ersities, Princes, and Prelates of the Church of God, but God himselfe (whose howse it is, and whose honor can neither be giuen nor taken away) is thus condemned: as is set forth in a late pam∣phlett intituled, An exact Discouerie of Romish doctrine in case of Conspiracie: Silence would be too suspicious, of neglect in many greatest duties, to God in heauen, his Church on earth, to your Maiestie, and the whole Catholike world.
Therefore I poe wretch and sinner an vnworthy member of that sacred bodie of Christ, and one of your Highnesse obedient subiects, in all submission craue pardon, not only to make de∣monstrance of Catholikes due and expected Loyaltie, to your Soueraigne Authoritie, and refute the friuoulous obiections of
 that Author: But with Dauid against Goliah in the behalfe of King Saul, and the people of God, to strike with his owne sword, and returne all and euery of his deadlie reasons, vppon himselfe, and his owne Profession.
Which▪ as I may lawfully obserue, by common consent of all, entreating of the law of conscience, in this case, being onely to vse our owne right of iust defence, and not to offend or defame Accu∣sers, (which charitable exposition, I desire of all Protestant Rea∣ders:) So, if I had trauelled no farther into that doctrine, then to the last printed booke by your Maiesties Printer, of the late inten∣ded conspiracy, I might as easily performe it: for that Protestant author giueth it out as a general Rule & vndoubted Maxime, to all professors of worship, to take armes, if their religion be in hazard: and that no priuate man could thinke his life more happily be∣stowed, than to fight pro Aris: which is greater liberty, than any opinion which our aduersarie can finde among Catholike Wri∣ters, so by him attached of treason and rebellion. But he shall re∣ceiue a more plaine and plentifull recitall, both of publike po∣sitions and practises, from all his neighbouring Allies in religion, to proue his owne profession, to be both Seminary and Granary of such prouision.
Which I am more inforced vnto, because this discouerer, by so many, not vsuall Catholike Authors, alleaged in his booke, disclo∣seth his inueterate malice against vs, that he was now in his desired oppotunitie, deliuered with ioy of that, wherewith hee had tra∣uailed so long in paine: or to renew in subtile mnner, his old good affection to your Maiestie, doth marshall you euen now, (other∣wise all his resons be too childish) in the number of cuell Ty∣rants, Excommunicates, Apostates, and the infamous of all ages, not only Princes, but base persons. So that eyther for disloyalty to your Highnesse, or inured inflamed hatred vnto vs, or both, hee can sinde no centr of his slaunders, except your Maiestie bee mde the man and marke, where at the penll canons and consti∣tutions of holy Church, did point and leuell hundreds of yeares, befre you were borne, r his religon receiued life.
This is the miserable & distressed state, of many thousands your most loyall and louing subiects, (dread Liege) for their faithfull dutie to God, and a religion taught in this kingdome, and imbra∣ced
 by all your progenitors, and our ancestors, so many hundred yeares, from their first conuersion: that euery aduersary may preach, and print against vs, and make their challenges; as though eyther for ignorance we could not, or for distrust of our cause, we were vnwilling to make them answer, or come to triall: when quite contrary, wee haue, often, earnestly, and by all meanes wee could, desired to haue it graunted, with equall conditions, a∣gainst the most selected and best learned Doctors of that reli∣gion.
And at this present, when your cheefest Protestant Cleargie, (Bishops, and others) is assembled, wee most humbly intreat, this so reasonable a Placet; that although they will not (as we feare) ea∣sily consent to an indifferent choyce, opposition, and defence in questions; yet, at the least, (to auoide the wonder of the world) they will be content, that we may haue publike audience, for those articles, opinions▪ and practise, for which we are so much condem∣ned, and persecuted. If wee shall not be able to defend or proue, any position generally maintained in our doctrine, to be confor∣mable to those rules in diuinity, which your Maiesty, and the pro∣testant lawes of England (we can offer no more) haue confirmed for holy, the canonicall Scriptures, the first generall Councells, the daies of Constantine, and the Primatiue Church; let the penalties be imposed and executed against vs. If we performe it, or this pe∣tition may not be admitted, we trust, that both our office to God, and duty to Prince, is discharged in this point.
Your royall Person, and that honorable consistory now assem∣bled, or holdn in your doctrine, to be the supreame sentencer, e∣uen in spirituall businesse in this kingdome: wee therefore hope you will not (in a Court from whence no appeale is allowed, and in matters of such consequence) proceede to iudgement, or deter∣mine of execution, before the arraigned is sommoned to answer, hath receiued, or refused triall, is, or can be proued guilty: for it is a Sages sentence: Iudicem & Aram esse idem; euen in ordinary. 3. Rhetor. Iudges: because people iniured or distressed flie to them both for refuge. And we humbly craue licence to say vnto you, as Liberius, Pope of Rome, answered Constantius the Emperour, perswadingTheodor. dialog. hist. trip, l, 5. c. 17 him to subscribe to the banishement of saint Athanasius, the great Gretian Patriarke, O Imperator, Iudicia ecclesiastica decet tam max∣ima
 proferri iustitia. If we be condemned, & our cause be iust, and religion true, it is God, and not man, against whom you proceede in sentence: if our profession be erroneous, and yet for consent with so many Nations, and so long continuance, it is left vnpuni∣shed; you onely pardon the frailty and ignorance of earthly men, and fight not with the heauenly.
Deny not that to vs, your euer true and obedient subiects, in a religion so antient, which your colleged Princes, the King of Spaine, and Arch-duke, doe offer to the so many yeares disobedi∣ent Netherlanders, vpon their temporall submittance, in so late an imbraced doctrine. That which the Arrian Emperors of the East, permitted to the Catholikes, (Bishops, Priests, Churches, tolleration:) what the barbarian Vandalls often offered, and some∣times truly performed in Africke; what the Turkish Emperor in Greece, and Protestant Princes in Germany, and other places allow to them of our religion, can be no singular offence, to grant vnto vs once in so many yeares, though our religion were vntrue. It would be acceptable to all Catholike Princes, conformable to the examples of protestant Rulers, not vnaunswerable to your owne princelie pietie, pittie and promise, no disgust to any equally minded Protestant, or Puritane at home, a Iubily to vs distressed; and (to answer all the discouerers quarrells in one sen∣tence) a warrant of security to your Maiesty, in all opinions a∣gainst those terrors and dangers which he conceiteth: from which, and all others, of what kinde soeuer, we most humbly beseech the infinite Maiesty of God, to preserue your Highnesse, and send you, your Queene, and posteritie, all happinesse and felicity in heauen and earth.
Amen.
