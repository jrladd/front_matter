Dread Soveraign,
YOur Majesties innate Propensity to Compassion being im∣proved
by all Christian and Princely Experience hath gi∣ven
me hopes that this Address humbly laid at Your
Sacred Feet▪ will be esteemed (if not in it self, yet
by it's Necessity) a Pardonable Presumption. As men under
Pressures are required by devout Prostration of their Souls and Bo∣dies
before his Throne to implore the merciful Help and Direction
of the King of Kings; so in the use of the means prescribed by
Divine Counsel, Subjects have no more assured way to relief than
by a submissive and dutiful Petitioning the Assistance of the Al∣mighties
Great and Wise Vicegerent. Not that trifling Complaints
should be permitted to disturb the Course of the Serenest Debates,
or any leap into Iordan without a Prophetick Confirmation of
mind that other Waters were insufficient for effecting the Cure.
As the Son of a Clergyman, a noted Confessor in the Late Parlia∣mentary
Persecutions, and as my self suffering under Scoffs, Re∣proaches,
often and tedious Imprisonments and Bonds for the same
Cause since Your Majesties blessed Restauration, I acquiesce and re∣joyce
in the Toleration. Nevertheless while Obedient Innocence
supports my Contentment, at the same time it commandeth me to
endeavour settlement in a Peaceable Estate, and that especially be∣cause
successful Pride groweth daily more insolent by silence, and
by degrees attempting upon my Neighbours also doth infringe the
Royal Prerogative and interrupt the Churches Tranquility. The
Considerations whereof with all Humility I offer to your Princely
Wisdom, Praying sollicitously and sincerely for Your Majesties
long and happy Life, that the dangers of this beleaguered Church
may be removed before your Translation to a more incomparable
Crown; In which will be compleated the felicity of
