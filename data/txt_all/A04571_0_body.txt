IN the height of admiration (which
my thoughts conceiued of the de∣serued
worth of this late deceased
nobleman) I imagined many deser∣uedly
boūd to offer to his name, signes of loue
and duty in a high measure, which I now find
contrary: Schollers I see (in these euill dayes)
giue no luster to Nobillity, but neclegently
suffer their renownes to consume with
their bodies, the pens of long lasting poesie,
writes not in times fore-head, vertues records
to posterity, but carelesly giues way to enuy
(that canker-worme to greatnesse) to eate out
all remembrance of mortallitie: some (I

know) will controulingly censure, and giue
sentence of this my ouer-bold presumption,
a taske more befitting a most excellent Ar∣tist,
but the reason of this my bold aduen∣ture
is, because I see the Muses lippes lockt
vp, and all loath to enter into the discription
of his honorable liues pilgrimage: be as it bee
will, I stand patiently armed against the biting
scoffes of selfe-conceited wits, with this rea∣sonable
excuse, I confesse ignorance, and with
all giue them thus to vnderstand, I neuer ta∣sted
one drop of Parnassus fountaine, but yet
care added to industrious trauells is able to
performe matters of importance, your high
worth may Iudge of my meaning, my loue to
the deceased begot this boldnesse, therefore
for his sake (whom you honored in life time)
daine to affoord one cheerefull countenance
to my humble affection, for I stand like poore
blind Irus before the worlds lottery, casting in
my lots either of good or euill fortune, where
if I chance to light but vpon any reasonable
prize of good liking, I haue my desire, but if

all happen blankes, I depart ouer-loaden with
burthens of discontent to my rustick cell, and
their pining lye consum'd away in penance
for this my presumption: so in duty I kisse
my hand, and humbly take my leaue.
