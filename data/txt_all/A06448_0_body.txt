THere bee three thinges
(Right worshipful) great∣lie
desired in this lyfe,
Health, VVealth, & Fame:
& it is a question which of these
is cheefe; the sicke sayth Health,
the couetous commendeth
VVealth, and both these place
good name last of all. But they be
both partiall Iudges, because
Health & VVealth, though they
be neuer so good, and so great,
end with the body, and are sub∣iect
to time. But honour, fame,
renowne, and good report, doe

tryumph ouer death, and make
men liue for euer:
Nunquā stigias fertur ad vmbras
Inclyta virtus.
Immensum calcar gloria habet;
there is not a greater inticement
vnto vertue, then Fame & true
glory:
Spes famae solet ad virtutem
impellere multos.
This made Alexander in honor
of armes to emulate Achilles,
Scipio Africanus to imitate Xe∣nophons
Cyrus, Caesar to pat∣terne
himselfe by Alexander, Se∣limus
Prince of Turkes to trace
the steps of Caesar, and Carolus
Quintus to fire his thoughts at
Philip Cominaeus his Lodoui∣cus
xi. King of Fraunce. Pro∣ceede
(noble and heroyick Spi∣rite)
with young Troylus to
ayme at Hectors glory. And as
the pregnancie of your Hopes

promiseth to be an Huniades to
the Turkes, a Talbot to the
French, and a Drake to the Spa∣nyard;
so also bee an Artaxerxes
to Hippocrates, an Alexander to
Pindarus and Aristotle, a Scipio
to Ennius, an Augustus to Vir∣gil,
a Traian to Plutarch, and a
Mecaenas to all Schollers. And
then as the sworde dooth defend
the penne of the Scholler, so the
penne shal grace the sword of the
Souldiour; & shall tunablie son∣net
that paracleticall verse out of
Horace:
Dignum laude virum Musa
vetat mori.
Learning indeede vvould bee
soone put to silence, without the
ayde & support of noble, boun∣tifull,
and generous spirits. In
hope of which ayde and suppor∣tation,
I present these diuine and
celestiall meditations vnto your
VVorship, which, vnder the title
of your protection, may doe as

much good in England, as they
haue done in Spayne, Portugall,
Italy, Fraunce, and Germanie.
Lodouicus Granatensis the Au∣thour
of these heauenly and spy∣rituall
Meditations, hath so cun∣ningly
portrayed in this Trea∣tise
the myseries and calamities
of this lyfe, and with such diuine
eloquence depainted the future
blessednes of the other, that for
stile hee seemes to mee another
Cicero, and for sounde and em∣phaticall
perswasion, a second
Paule. VVhose diuine spirit, &
heauenly writing, as it hath mo∣ued
the Italians Camillus Camilli,
Georgius Angelierus, Timotheus
Bagnus, & Iohannes Baptista Por∣cacchius
to translate his works in∣to
theyr language, and Michael
of Isselt, to conuert thē into La∣tine,
& Philippus Doberniner in∣to
the Germaine tongue, so also
hath it mooued me, to digest thē
into English; that nowe at the

length our Country might en∣ioy
that rare Iewel, vvhich those
famous Countries doe so highly
prize. For further commenda∣tion
of the Authour and thys
Booke, I referre your VVorship
to the present discourse, which I
assure my selfe will worke those
motions in you, that it shal ney∣ther
yrke you of your paines, nor
mee of my labour. Thus boldlie
presuming on your curteous ac∣ceptation,
I commit you to hys
sacred protection, who graceth
heere vpon the earth the memo∣ries
of the valiant and vertuous
by the pennes of Schollers, and
glorifieth them in heauen, with
his chosen men of vvarre, who
with Iosua haue fought his bat∣tailes,
and with Dauid haue vn∣sheathed
their swords to auenge
his quarrell. London the 24. of
Nouember. 1598.
