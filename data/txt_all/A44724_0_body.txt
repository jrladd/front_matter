SIR,
Wales had one Glorious Prince of haire and hue
(Which colour sticks unto Him still) like You:
He travell'd far, He won His spurs in France,
And tooke the King, the KING, Ã´ monstrous chance
Then His victorious troupes afresh He getherss
And with the gray Goose-wing his shaftsnew fethers,
He beats a march up the Pyrene Hils,
And the Cantabrian clime with terrofils,
To re-inthrone Don Pedro Castile's King,
Of which heroique Act all Stories ring.
Your Royall Sire travell'd so far, and Thay
Of all our Princes only made that way.

Who knowes, Great Sir, but by just destiny,
Your bunch of (Youthfull) Plumes may further fly?
But Faulcon-like, You may with full summ'd wing
The Eagle cuff, and from his tallons wring
ThePalatinat. Prey, or in exchange seize on his Ore,
And fixe Your Standard on the Indian shore.
'Twas byCarolus Magnus.  Charles, France once the Empire got,
'Twas by aCarol Quintus. Charles the Spaniard due that los,
Why may not Brittaine challenge the next call,
And by a CHARLES be made Imperiall?
