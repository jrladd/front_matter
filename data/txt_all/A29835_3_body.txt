My Lord,
SInce our Minds do natu∣rally hunt after know∣ledge of Novelties, and scarce rest satisfied with the present state of things, (such being the boundless limits of our Conceptions): Man is generally seen to measure the length of his Age by the

fathom of his Knowledge: Judgment being as the Pre∣sident over all his Actions, whil'st Sense and Motion be∣comes the two Interpreters of his will and pleasure. As Hi∣story therefore is ever allow'd the most proper direction for the Life of Man, and Learn∣ing accounted the only Trea∣sure which can enrich his Mind: The one better teach∣ing by example than Pre∣cept; the other making ful∣ler Discoveries of Mens Lives and Actions. If the actions therefore of Princes may be granted the subjects of History, sure this of Heal∣ing

ought to take place, where it is not only to be recorded as History barely, but deserves registring amongst the most Divine Gifts, and Eminent Qualifications of their Ma∣jestick Vertues.
Amongst the best and great∣est of which Worthies, I shall presume to present this Heal∣ing Vertue of our Dread So∣veraigns, in which action he appears as the Soul to the Body; and is seen to main∣tain his three Nations in Health as well as Peace: as Nature does rule in her hu∣mane Empire with three Fa∣culties, for as her Animal, Vi∣tal,

and Natural Faculties are kept up and preserved by their Nerves, Arteries and Veins, by which Mankind shews both his Motion, Sense and Life: So whosoever con∣siders the daily Blessings our three Kingdoms do receive from his Sacred Majesty, must necessarily be convinced, That as the animal Faculties lodge in his Royal Head, which gives that sense to every af∣fair we prosecute, so his Sa∣cred Hands are sweetned with that sacred Salutiferous gift of Healing, which both sup∣ports the Body Politick, and keeps up the Denizens and

Subjects thereof in vigor and courage.
And if we can give Faith to the vertues of inanimate Elements and Vegetables, as Stones, Herbs, Plants, and the like, what shall we allow the Living Stones of the Church, our Kings and Queens, its Nursing Fa∣thers and Mothers, where we shall find both their hands most admirably qualified? In whose right Hands are the Nerves and Sinews of the Church and State, which gives them that decent Form, or∣derly Motion, and admirable Discipline we see them enjoy.

In their Left, we see the life and spirit of the three Na∣tions supported and preserved by their miraculous Gifts of Healing: and as the first e∣stablish'd them the Defenders of the Faith, the second con∣firm'd them the Preservers of their People: The one dis∣playing the Royal Emblems of their sacred Piety and Ju∣stice: The other engraving the Remarks of their sove∣raign Clemency and Charity. The former, making the whole World pay Veneration and Reverence to our English Kings, and their Royal Names: The later, illu∣strating

with wonder the sa∣cred Riches of their Divine Natures: Their Royal pow∣er manifesting their Majesty, and this soveraign Gift of Healing, their higher Rays of Divinity. And as one does ad∣minister Order and Peace, which gives life and being to Devotion; so the other brings health and ease, which keeps up Society, and makes Com∣munication flourish in a Na∣tion.
As Nature therefore, the Mistress of Society, does e∣vermore prefer publick before private Good, and Man was born for conversation sake;

so by the stream of Duty, I have presumed to Elect your Lordship as the best Patron of this Treatise, Entituled, The Royal Gift of Healing. Where if Congruity makes De∣dication bear correspondence with Design, I'm sure I am very happy in my choice, if Your Lordship will grant me the freedom of my Election; Where although I begin the shew of my Devotion with a mean Sacrifice, wrought up by an unskilful hand, yet I hope your Honor will not mea∣sure my good-will by the value of the Present, but by the brightness of your own Good∣ness,

who are a great Master of Excellent Learning, Re∣ligious Life, and Pious Con∣versation. My Lord, The eminent and well-deserved place your Honor enjoys in the Kings presence, as well as in his Princely and Royal Pa∣lace, being Clerk to the Clo∣set of his Sacred Majesty, do's not only place you near your Soveraign, but puts you at his Right hand, by whose clean hands the Royal Gold which is used at our daily Healings, is presented to our Sacred Majesty. And this makes you as great a Judge as Observer of these his wonder∣ful

and miraculous Cures so frequently made good by his Sacred Hands: the which as they have been infinite in num∣ber, so ought they to be ac∣counted miraculous in their Nature. Your Lordship hath been a sufficient witness here∣of, and can justifie the Effects and Events of the same to all the World. But lest I may seem tedious to your Honor, well knowing the minutes of Great Men are Sacred, and not to be invaded by every little Address, I commit the ensuing Discourse it self (whereof I claim nothing to my self but the Faults) to

Your Honorable Patronage, Begging pardon for my pre∣sumption and lapses, humbly presuming to write my self,
My Lord,
