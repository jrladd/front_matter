Right Honourable,
I Know you cannot be Ignorant of the (at present) Deplo∣rable Estate of England, whose former Plenty, and Freedome, of Commerce, hath sounded as Ecchoes of Tryumph to all Nations round about her: and in despite of envy or their Emulating her happiness, made her Trade the Worlds Exchange: untill of late years (for such is her un∣happiness) her Millions of plenty are grown to complaints, and such her Commerce into a Languishing consumption: so universally dispersed that even the greatest of her Gentry complain for want of Mony, whilst their Tenants groan under the burthen of Contribution and Taxes; The Mar∣chant and Mariner, too late sorrowing for their loss of no less then 1300 Sail of Ships since the Warr with Spain, whereof many richly laden; to the ruine of their Owners and Proprietors; when others yet Trading, and paying Excise, with other great Duties, complain more for the Intollerable burthen by the manner of Collecting it, then the duty it self: the laws of Excise being in truth contrived (as if purposely) to mantain a numerous rabble of Excise-men, the most use∣less and unprofitable members in a Common-wealth: who making themselves gainers by the ruine of Trade, go away with the greatest share of the revennue, whilst the private Souldier for want of pay is brought to a kind of beggarry; being driven to take upon trust, (where they can have it,)

the very meat they eat; and considering their penni-worths to pay dear for the Interest. All which together with the com∣plaints of many, Thousands poor Families distressed throughout the Nation, for want of Trade, being considered, I hope will so work upon your spirits, (now the Lord hath a∣gain, I presume beyond your own Expectations brought you together) that you will not rest till you have Improved this opportunity once more put into your hands of doing good for your Country, to which end you are called; wherein the Lord will undoubtedly own you, and those yet unborn be Obliged to Honour your remembrance.
And apprehending that amongst other waighty affaires that of raising Monies for time to come, for supply of the Army, and Navy of the Common-wealth, by the most equi∣table and properest waies, not burthensome to the Nation, with the increase of Trade, Mony, and Shiping, (all so much wanting in England) are not the least of Importance: and having had the perusal of the several reports, and pro∣posals made this Parliament and Committee of Inspection, with all others that have written in reference thereunto; I have upon serious consideration substracted the most sutable and (as I apprehend) properest collections from the whole, and have taken liberty to publish it, with some additions of my own observations in England, and Experience in For∣rain parts: which, when receiving the Honour of your debate, will I hope merrit the favour of your good likeing, and the Authour have his expected reward, by being an Instrument of promoting the good and welfare of his Country.
