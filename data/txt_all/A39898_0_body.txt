MY LORD!
HErodotus Reports that the Aegyp∣tians
by Wrapping their Dead in
Glasse, presents them lively to all
Posterity; But your Lordship will
do more, by the Vivifying beames
of your Acceptation, Revive he∣parents
of this Orphan Poem, and make them live
to Eternity. While the Stage florisht, the POEM
liv'd by the breath of Generall Applauses, and the
Virtuall Fervor of the Court; But since hath lan

guisht for want of heate, and now neere sbrunk up
with Cold, creepes (with a shivering feare) to
Extend it selse at the Flames of your Bengnity. My
Lord, though it seems Rough and Forlorn, It is the
jssu of Worthy parents, and we doubt not, but you
will find it accomplisht with their Vertue. Be pleased
then (my Lord) to give it entertainment, the more
Destitute and neea it is, the Greater Reward may
be challenged by your Charity; and so being shelt r'd
under your Wings, and Comsorted by the Sun-shine
of your Favoure, it will become Proofe against the
Injustice of Time, and like one of Dmetrius statues
appeare fresher and fresher to all Ages. My Lord,
were we not Confident of the Excellence of the Peece,
wee should not dare to Assume an impudence to pre∣ferr
it to a Person of your HONOR, and KNOWN
JUDGMENT; whose HEARTS are ready
SACRIFICES, to your NAME and HO∣NOR,
Being my Lord
