Worthy Sir,
I Well know how unworthy this slender Discourse was of those judicious eares which vouchsafed it the hearing; and surely cannot but much more judge it un∣deserving a publique view: So that if (besides friends importunity perswading) the fear of an abortive birth to have been brought forth by some unskilfull Notary, had not enforced me, it should have been buried in privacy.
Being thus necessitated, and thereupon advised by you and others to this unwelcome task, I knew not any fitter then your self to whom I should present this Dedication.
How cordial a welwisher, and forward an incourager you have alwaies been of the Orthodox Clergy, all that know you will assert, and in particular, what an ardent affection lodged in your bosome and flamed forth in your expressions towards your Reverend Minister was abun∣dantly testified both in his life and at his death, whilest in his life you were one of the first in providing for his com∣fortable subsistence, and at his death you took care for his decent buriall, desiring that your house might receive him when dead (which had so often entertained him alive) from

whence he was honourably attended to his grave.
I doubt not but there were many other worthy Gentlemen of your Parish, to whom this deceased servant of Christ was much engaged; but I hope my ignorance of their per∣sons will be a sufficient Apologie for my silence. With you (Esteemed Sir) I have had by his means the ho∣nour to be acquainted, of whom therefore I am bold (espe∣cially for his sake) to desire the Patronage of this Sermon.
What hath suspended the Publication since I last saw you, I am confident you have already heard; a disease not much unlike that which snatched away our dear friend, but from which God was graciously pleased to deliver me: Thus is his wisdom sometimes pleased to let the barren Fig∣tree stand, whilest he plucketh up the fruitfull Vine.
His race is now run, and he is gone to Rest; his work is finished, and he hath in part received his Wages; Weep not for him who is already entred into joy, rather rejoyce, that though he be gone, God hath sent you another, one eminent both for Piety and Learning, in whose converse I doubt not but you will finde much content, and by whose labours I hope you will reap much profit.
And now Sir, I commend you to God, earnestly im∣ploring the continuance and increase of all externall and internall blessings upon you, in your own person, your dear Consort, aged Father, hopefull children, till at last he crown you all with eternall happiness. I take my leave and subscribe my self,
