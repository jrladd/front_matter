MADAM,
WEre not my obedience to your Ladyships Com∣mands, much greater than any ambition of being in Print, I should not have troubled your Ladyship, or the

world, with so mean an Offering and performance; for which I should, ac∣cording to Custom, have made some solemn Apology, but that your Lady∣ships Name and Patronage will be its best Vindication: a Favour, which as it transcends all that my merit or abilities in this kind can pretend to, so I cannot but be the more sensible of it, for ha∣ving given me the honour (though un∣expected) of paying my poor little loyal humble Mite to the never dying memory of the Best of KINGS; and thereby of publickly acknowledg∣ing likewise those Obligations, and par∣ticularly the happiness of attending his Excellency and your Ladyship, since my coming to this place, which sub∣scribes me in all gratitude and zeal
