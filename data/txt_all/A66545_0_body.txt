My LORD,
THE Kind Reception I have upon all Occasions met with from your Lordship, Emboldens me to lay the follow∣ing Papers at your Feet; not
that I pretend to offer any thing worth your Lordships Favour, your thorough Experience into, and Exquisite Skill in whatever relates to Chymistry, makes me too Conscious to my self how lit∣tle this deserves your Patronage and Protection.
But since I have no other way left me of acknowledging the ma∣ny Obligations I lye under to your Lordship, I rather choose to run the hazard of my Repu∣tation on this account, then pass off the Stage with the Guilt of Ingratitude upon me, who must ever attribute all I now enjoy at Home to the Care and Goodness of your Lordship.
Accept then my Lord, I be∣seech you, the Sincere, though
weak Endeavours of my Declin∣ing Years, and judge not my Respect and Duty by the mean∣ness of the Performance. The Honour of your Lordships Ap∣probation will Fortifie me against Censure; And however defective I may seem to have been, yet I have still the hopes that I may by this means Incite others to greater and nobler Attempts of this kind, and put them upon a deeper Search into the more close Recesses of this so Ʋseful, but Mysterious Art.
And here, my Lord, I can∣not omit, with humble Submis∣sion, Suggesting to your Lord∣ship, how happy wou'd the pre∣sent Age be, as well as Posterity, if so great a Genius as your Lordship wou'd please to borrow
some few Minutes, from your other more weighty Affairs, to Collect the Curious Observations you have made in Cymistry, and Communicate them to the World; What might we not ex∣pect from such Indefatigable In∣dustry, and so great a Capacity! Even the Admirable Mr. Boyle, where he alive, might with plea∣sure see himself out-done, in what was his Chiefest Darling and Mistris.
But I shall wave the Enlarg∣ing on this Subject, lest by at∣tempting to give your just Praises I should lessen that Character, which all who have the Honour to know your Lordship, must confess you truly deserve.

May your Lordship enjoy a full Measure of Health and Ho∣nour; and may After-Ages with Admiration behold your Lord∣ships Excellent Vertues still shi∣ning forth, in a Generous and Noble Posterity, is the Earnest Prayer of
