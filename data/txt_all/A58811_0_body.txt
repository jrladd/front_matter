Right Honourable,
THough I esteem my self as
much as I deserve, and perhaps
a little more, yet I thank God
I was never yet so partial to my self, or
fond of my own Conceptions, as to
think the Publication of them an Act
of Charity, either to the world, or to
the Bookseller; and as for this Dis∣course,
I assure you, had not you had a

better opinion of it then I; I should
have been so charitabl as to have kept
it within doors, and not to have ex∣posed
it to the open Air, in which I
have known many wiser discourses to
have gotten their bane; but I shall not
be so unmannerly as to controul your
opinion, wch yet I doubt had not been
so favourable to me, had not your
Judgments been bribed by your Zeal
to the Protestant Religion, against the
Adversary whereof this discourse was
designed, perhaps the Protestant Rea∣der,
who is unacquainted with the
transactions of the last 600 years, may
think I have been too severe upon the
Roman Religion, charging it with
such bloudy Principles, and Practises:
to which I shall say no more then this;
that if I have falsified its Character, or
represented it fouler than it is: let me

indure the shame, and punishment of
a common Calumniator; but if I have
drawn it according to its own natural
Features, and Complexions; it is not
my fault that it appears deformed, and
if it be as bad as 'tis represented, it
makes invectives enough against it
self, and carries its Satyrs in its own
bosom: But what I have said of it is
all matter of Fact, which I have prov∣ed
by the testimony of their own Au∣thors,
who cannot be supposed to be
false witnesses against themselves, and
if, after this, any one should be so ob∣stinate
as to suspect me of forgery;
let him peruse the Martyrologies
of the six last Centuries, and com∣pare
them with the bloodiest of all the
ten Pesecutions: and I doubt not but
he will be of my opinion, viz. that
Domitian and Dioclesian were but pu∣ny

Persecutors, and Bunglers in cru∣elty
compared with the infallible Cut-throats
of the Apostolical Chair.
Having thus accounted for the ho∣nesty
of this discourse; I have no more
to say for it, but only this; that howe∣ver
it may succeed, it was well intend∣ed;
and if it prove any way instrumen∣tal
to alay the un-Christian heats, and
Animosities among us, to promote
the peace of the Church, and the in∣terest
of the Protestant Religion, I
have my design: and though I should
be defeated in this, it will be some sa∣tisfaction
to me, that I have honour'd
my self before the world by this ad∣dress,
and testified by my ready com∣pliance
with your commands how
really I am,
