NOthing hath been more severely charged upon the Church of Rome, and the Proselytes thereof, since the Reformation, than their aversness and disaffe∣ction to Government; the belief whereof hath caused many heavy Laws, a continued jealousie, much slaugh∣ter and devastation among them. And the like hath no less severely been charged back by them upon the Refor∣mation; It is manifest (saith the Author of the Prote∣stants Babel) that in all places at home, as well as abroad, this spirit of Resormation hath ever been, and is seditiously pragmatical and dangerous unto Princes and States; in∣somuch that within the space of sixty Years, more Princes have been deposed and persecuted by Protestants upon the quarrel and difference of Religion, than had been by the Popes excommunication, or by the attempts and practices of any subjects Catholick in six hundred years before (and
 yet our late Martyred Sovereign had not then been brought unto the block;) Wherefore I thought it worth my while and my pains to find out the Criminals; for if Christianity in general be faulty, Princes may well be shie; or if there be not a Religion more Orthodox and Loyal than other, they may alike be favourable to all, but affected with none; This I say) made me to single out the present Malefactors of the Age, the Jesuite (with his Faction) for the Roman; and the Puritan (with his) for the English Church: who though harmless and innocent by their own account (for all the late applications to our af∣ter murdered Sovereign, were ushered in with, We your Majesties most loyal and dutiful Subjects; and the Restauration of our present King no less congratulated with, We your best and experienced Friends) yet if I have fixed wrong, or charged either of them unjustly (provided their own Writings may be the Judges in the case) I am content to undergo their burden; and when the next Rebellion or Commotion happens, for want of one of them in it (that justly deserves execution,) to be the man: And if this be proved, I hope, I shall no longer be blamed, either on the one hand or the other, for having, or still continuing to call them, Brethren in Iniquity; or for telling you and others where our danger lies, that Authority may know at whose Door to Knock, and by their severity and care prevent all future and growing mischiefs. Sure I am, there is a sort of Evil Doers a∣mong
 us, and if the Sword that should be a terror to such (the Sword they delight in so much) be born in vain, we shall all be made a Babel indeed. My prayer therefore shall be, That at such time, and in such streights, the King may never want Champions like you to defend him; nor such Champions a reward, whilst Loyalty is to be accounted a Virtue, and Valour deserves its Trophee.

Long Melford, Suff. Nov. 5. 1682.
