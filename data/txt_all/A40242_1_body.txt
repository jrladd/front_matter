Poor Hearts,
IS this a time to chide, & be angry, and pick quarrels? and (if you must needs do so) can you find no o∣ther objects of your indignation, but the Lords Disciples: but peaceable, holy, humble, self-denying men; Is not the work of the Ministry to preach the Gospel: Is not the Sword of the Ma∣gistrate appointed to the punishment of evil doers, and to the praise of them that do well. Are you incumbent in your duties: Are you laying out your Talents to the end they were given you, or are you mistaken in the thing. When did you proclaim war against Drunkards, Swearers, common blas∣phemers, enemies to the Lord and his people: Have you none of those a∣mongst you? or are your high-flown contending Spirits gone beyond such slender wrastlings, that you scorn to encounter

with any below the degree of a Saint: The Lord open your eyes, and let you see, and give you hearts to consider your several duties. But tell me, ye sons of Levi (as ye call your selves) ye that pretend a Ius Di∣vinum to persecution; What will ye say, when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, and shall sit upon the Throne of his glory, and all Nations shall be gathered before him: Mind ye what will be the great work of that great day; your Petition will surely then be heard. I beseech you read the Paper of Causes set down to be first heard at that Tribunal, in Mat. 25. 31. to the end of the Chapter: And the Lord let it dwell upon your hearts for ever.
