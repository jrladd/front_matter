ALL that Iob lost in
his Affliction, he
found double in
his Readvance∣ment:
His chil∣dren
were not doubled, there∣fore
were not lost. This I speake
not to spoyle the Complement
of common comforters: I know


roone descants upon these Marriages, I
will neither recite nor avouch, but wil con∣clude
as Charoone does in many things,
nothing: Onely my drift is, to make
knowne, that this last Marriage was con∣summated
betwixt your incomparable bro∣ther
(whose funeralls I here celebrate)
and me; betwixt whom there was rather
an Identity, then a brotherhood; Frater,
ferè alter, Amicus, verè alter. The Ele∣gie
which David wrote upon his Iona∣than,
2 Sam. 1. 19. warrants mee to doe
the like upon mine; whose loves were both
alike, both passing the love of women:
What I have done, is the Ensigne of my
true Affection, whose supporters are,
an Honorable Lady, and her noble Sonne:
Accept it from his hands who is,
