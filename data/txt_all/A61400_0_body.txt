My Lord,
THere is hardly a kind of Persecution more Irresistible than that of Dedications.—No Monarch can defend himself from it, since the Invention of Printing. By this kind of Visit, a Plebean (whether he Adorns or Disgraces the Press, 'tis no matter) can Vault into the view of the Most Exalted Wits, and Most Renowned of Men.
If Custom be any Excuse for such fashionable Presump∣tions, I hope your Lordship will pardon the Boldness I have taken, to shelter this Product of some Retired hours, under the Prote∣ction of your Honourable Name.
Some Sheets of the same nature were not long since presented to your Lordship in Prose, which Allarm'd a Silent Specta∣tors Muse, to Revive that Ingenious Paraphrase in the Mo∣dern
 Attire of Measure and Cadency; which though un∣adorn'd with those Affected Flights of Fancy, those Heaven-daring Metaphors, that (by an Antiphrasis) becautifie the Raptures of the PERPETUAL STATE-POET [the Achitophel-maker;] yet (my Lord) you will find it plain and honest, and expressive of the Sympathy which some of a Lower Orb, bear to the Contriv'd Sufferings of so Illustrious an Innocent as DA∣NIEL was.
But who can Fall when Heaven is the Protector? Or what Machinations can prosper, when countermin'd by the Di∣vinity? If Men of Meer Wit will needs wantonly Allegorize SACRED HISTORY, and by Misapplied Parallels, throw Affronts upon our Great and Loyal States-Men, then (whether They will, or no,) Men of Loyalty will borrow Scrip∣ture Artillery, and Allegorize it in a sober Attaque, to Batter down the Babels of such Daniel-Catchers.
That your Lordship may Live Long and Happy, to serve your King and Country, in spight of all your Enemies, is the Hearty Prayer of
My Lord,
