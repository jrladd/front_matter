My much honoured Lord and Lady:
AS that speciall duty which I my selfe owe to you both; so that purpose which my dear husband had (while he lived) of dedica∣ting to you this Commentary of his upon S. Peters Epistle, bindeth mee (who am left his sole Executrix, to see his VVill e∣very way performed) to set out this first of his workes, published since his death, under your Honourable Names. It pleased you to take into your Family a childe of his body: be fur∣ther pleased (I pray you) to take into your Patronage this childe of his soule; which, as an Orphane, yea, as a Posthumus, in all humility is presented unto you. You manifested more then ordinary kindnesse to my husband while he lived; wee and ours have oft tasted of the sweetnesse of your bounty: so that I should deserve to be accounted most ingratefull, if I

should burie so many favours in oblivion, or neglect to provoke others to love and good workes, by proposall of your example. Ac∣cept, I beseech you, this poore acknowledge∣ment of thanks; which is most due, first, to that primary Fountain of all goodnesse, Almighty God, for keeping your Lordship safe in your late imployment in the Palatinate, and for freeing your Ladiship from those fears where∣unto you could not but be subject, by reason of his long absence; and for giving you both, a mutuall and comfortable fruition one of ano∣ther: And next, to your selves, for all those kindnesses, which, while my husband lived, you did to him and his, and since his death you continue to doe to such as he hath left behinde him. Now, the good God continue his bles∣sed protection over you both, and take all that belong unto you, under the wings of his father∣ly Providence. And so I rest, with the renew∣all of my sute, that you would cast your eyes upon this VVork of him who much honoured you in his life time; and is, after his decease, of∣fred to you by
