Christian Reader.
THese two ensuing Sermons,
being taken by the careful
hand of a ready Writer, and
a very good friend of the
Reverend Authors, to pre∣vent
abuse by imperfect Co∣pies
(which we hear are coming forth) they
are exposed to publick view; and if we
may estimate them by the worth of the Au∣thor,
and seasonableness of the subject, we
cannot imagine but that they will be much
valued when they come abroad; seeing they
are not only his last words, but in that they
present to all men such a pattern of peace, as

the God of peace, and the necessity of fol∣lowing
peace with all men, in a way of
holiness, without which no man shall see
God. We need not mention the vast diffe∣rence
betwixt hearing and reading, or the
lustre lost in Printing, which words had in de∣livering
neither how neatly they might have
been cloathed if sent abroad by the Author;
all that we shall say, is, thou hast them in such
adress as they were clad with in their first
delivery: and be they read with as good af∣fection,
as they were preached, and heard,
through the Spirits assistance will not prove
as a dead letter.
Farewell.
