IT was the saying of our Blessed Saviour That a Pro∣phet could not be without honour save in his own Country. Although I count my self no Prophet, yet by the Rules of Astrology I have predicted such things which (to our sorrow) have come to pass as may appear in my Almanack for the year 1665. and others formerly writ∣ten: I presume, I have both Friends, and Enemies a∣mongsty u; its well known unto many, that I have done very great cures both in the Town, and places adjacent, although I have not mentioned their names in this Book, yet I find that many being unsatisfied concerning the legality of my way of Cure, have refused to come or send unto me for help to cure their infirmities: and many of  wh did come, cme for the most part privately, fear∣ing either loss of reputation or reproaches from their Neighbours, and other unsatisfied people; and also fear∣ then what I did, was either Diablical, or by unlaw∣ful means. I question not but when you have read over this Book, although some things may seem mistical at the first, especially unto such who never before read any books of this nature, yet by oft perusied and well heed∣ing what I have written, I am confident it may, and will give satisfaction unto any of reasonable capacity: and for the benefit of those who deire Knowledge in the Astrological and Chymical way of Physick (which is the

most assured way extant) I have both briefly and plainly instructed the learner herein, so that those who can but read and will take pains may assuredly attain unto it, and be inabled thereby to do the like Cures as I have done: and as concerning the resolution of questions by Figures, a thing much questioned by some, I have in this book given sufficient reasons thereof according unto Art, thereby inabling others (if they please to take the pains) to do the like. What I have formerly done herein, was more to satisfie the earnest importunity of others, than for any gain or profit which came unto me, for I alwayes (al∣though some reward was given me for my pains therein) accounted my self a loser thereby, in regard of my Practice in Physick; and let the Artist be never so careful to give content, yet what will the most men say, (especially such who are ignorant of the Art) if we discover the thing sought after, surely he doth it by the Devil, otherwise, how could he do it, but if we chance to fail, as sometimes we may by taking a wrong Ascendant, then they will as∣suredly say, they are cheated of their money: I speak se∣riously I take no pleasure in such questions, for the rea∣sons aforesaid, having denied many which came unto me therefore. Kind Country men and Women, my thoughts are better of you then wholly to blame you, for I dare say it was either false reports, or ignorance of the way I pro∣fess, which caused many of you to be enemical unto me; wherefore, I have the rather published this Treatise that so fr time to come, you may not only be setled in your opinion, but also be fully satisfied, that what I have al∣ready done, or shall for time to come do in the Astrologi∣cal or Chymical way of Physick, which is the way of my Practice, is both honest, just, and lawful; and is no more then what every industrious Physician ought to know, and without knowledge therein, its impssible to

be an expert Physitian, as in this book will appear: Concerning the Legality of this Art of Astrology, if any are unsatisfied they may read y Epistles of those Almanacks Dated, 1658. and 1659. besides there are many Authentick Authors who have written both learn∣edly and largely thereupon, for I intend not at this time t trouble my self or reader much farther herein, only thus much at present, I say, next unto Divinity it is the most to be admired and most excellent study in the World, and worthy our knowledge; for there is so much seen of the wonderful Work of God in it, that it must needs convince the most unbelieving persons whatsoever, and cause them to know that a mighty and powerful hand hath wrought those wonders which we visibly see, is the Heavens, Sun, Moon; Stars and Planets, with their Motions and pow∣erful Operations over all sublunary Creatures; and hath given unto man so much Knowledge thereby (Next unto the Angels) that he is able to reveale and make known in a great measure his Heavenly Will thereby unto his People, that so they may be forewarned of his wrath to come. If I find this Book hath acceptance with you, I shall be incouraged to labour in my study and profession to do you and the Country farther service, and shall ever remain, your assured loving Country man and Servant.
