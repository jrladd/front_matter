Honoured Sir,
THE Apostle Paul, being Accused by the Malicious Jews, and many grievous Complaints laid against him, saying, he was a Pestilent Fellow, a Mover of Sedition [or Contention] And that before Felix, the Governour, and Agrippa the King; yet in this the Apo∣stle comforted himself, and thought himself happy in, that those Noble Persons gave him leave to speak for him∣self, and to make his Christian Defence. And in like man∣ner do I think my self happy, (Honoured Sir) in that I have the Benefit of my Pen, and the Press, to make my de∣fence against the loud out-crys, and heavy Clamours of this People; who have in Print exposed me under as odi∣ous Names, as their Tongue can invent: And altho' my de∣fence against their causless Accusations may not hold paral∣lel with what that great Apostle made for himself, and his Christian Profession, which the Jews accounted Here∣sie: Yet have I adventured to spend some leisurable hours, to set forth to the World some reasons, why it is no Apo∣stasie from the Christian Faith, to separate from the Quakers.
Be pleased therefore, That under your Name and Patro∣nage they may appear, as a Covert to vail their Imperfe∣ctions, for Defective they must needs be in many respects: First, For that I am not endued with that Spirit the Apo∣stles had: Secondly, I am not Accomplish'd with Parts and Learning, sufficient to graple with such Schollars as are some of the Chieftains of the Quakers: Thirdly, My
 Trade and other Business, which I have upon me, are great Impediments, and Hindrances from that study, which is requisite to such a work. And Fourthly, My distance from the Press occasions many Omitions and Mistakes. Yet forasmuch as when I first appear'd publick against their Errors in Anno 1682. I presum'd to Dedicate the same to your self, in hopes of your favourable sensure; and meeting then with no reproof, gives me ground to presume this once more, to present you with what followeth, in hopes still to obtain your favourable Construction; of whose Goodness, Moderation, and Impartial Justice; I have had more than Twenty Years experience, as well as your bearing with, and forbearing me, in some scru∣ples I have had; whether by reason of my long time of Education among that People, or other Infirmity, I can∣not tell; God knoweth; yet, such has been your Christi∣an Condiscention to me therein, as well as to others; that should I enlarge upon it, it might rather diminish than add to you: In the Eyes of some who are not that way inclined: and therefore it doth sufficiently suffice that I have reaped the benefit of it; which as it ever did, so it ever will Oblige me to your Service, with all Respect, and Grateful Acknowledgments of your Especial Favours.
I am, Sir,

Milden-Hall,
Septem∣ber the 3d. 1692.
