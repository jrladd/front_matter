IN this small Treatise the Reader
may not reasonably expect to
have his Fancy much delighted,
(Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta
doceri)
but only to have his Understanding
informed; and therefore the Author
hath industriously avoided all curious
Flowers of Rhetorick, and made it his
whole business to feed his Reader with
abundant variety of Excellent Fruits.
Here are interspersed some Obser∣vations,
which though already known
to many English men, yet may be un∣known
to most Strangers and Forreign∣ers,
for the information of whom

this Book is secondarily intended; and
for that end will shortly be translated
into the French Tongue; whereby
may be extinguisht in some measure
the Thirst which Forreigners general∣ly
have to know the Present State of
this Considerable Monarchy.
Although the main aim is to inform
all men of the Present State of this
Kingdom, yet divers Reflections are
made upon the past State thereof,
that so by comparing that with the
present, some men may thereby not
only be moved to endeavour the Re∣stauration
of what was heretofore
better, and the abolition of what is
now worse; but also in some measure
may fore-see without consulting our
Astrologers and Apocalytick men, what
will be the future state of this Na∣tion:
according to that Excellent Say∣ing,
Qui respicit praeterita & inspicit
praesentia, prospicit etiam & futura.

A good Historian by running back to
Ages past, and by standing still and
viewing the present times, and com∣paring
the one with the other, may then
run forward, and give a Verdict of the
State almost Prophetick.
In the many Reflections upon the
Antient State of England, frequent
use is made of divers grave Authors,
as of Horn in his Mirror of Justice,
of Glanvile, Bracton, Britton, For∣tescue,
Linwood, Stamford, Smith,
Cosens, Camden, Cook, Spelman,
Selden, &c. And for the present
State, Consultation was had with
several eminently learned Persona∣ges
yet living, to the end that the
Reader might receive at least some
satisfaction in every particular, with∣out
the trouble and charges of a
great Library. And as the Author
doth sometimes use both the Words
of the Living and the Writings▪ of the

Dead, without quoting any, to a∣void
Ostentation; so he hopes that
this ingenuous Confession being
made at first, no man will be offend∣ed
though he give no notice when the
Observation is theirs, and when it is
his own; having taken special care
that both in theirs and in his own,
there should be nothing but the
truth: so that although the Reader
not perceiving every where by what
Authority divers things are averred,
may be apt to suspect that some things
are gratis dicta, yet if it shall please him
to make search, he will find that ge∣nerally
they are vere & cum authorita∣te
dicta.
However in a Subject so multiform
as this, where so many Marks are
aimed at, no wonder if in some the
Author hath not hit the White; but
wheresoever it was missed, it is not
perhaps much wide there-from; and

if in any thing by mis-information or
mis-observation there be any palpa∣ble
mistake (as humanum est errare)
it shall in the next Impression be du∣ly
corrected, if any Reader will be so
couteous as to advertise either the
Author, the Printer, or Publisher, by
Letter or otherwise.
Brevity and a Laconique Stile is
aimed at all along, that so there
might be Magnum in Parvo, that it
might be mole minimus, though Re
magnus; that the whole State of
England might be seen at once,
, or as in a Map; that
as it will be a necessary Book for all
Englishmen at all times: so every one
might without trouble alwayes carry
it about with him as a Companion to
consult upon all occasions.
