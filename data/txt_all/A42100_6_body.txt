SIR,
AFTER I had inished the foregoing
Books, In which, I conceive, as far as
Glasses will yet lead us, I have clearly De∣scrib'd
and Delineated the Structure of a
Plant; and have endeavour'd, in some
part, to Vnfold the Reason and Scope of Nature there∣in:
I was willing to sit down, and leave what remained,
to the Improvements of the Present and Succeeding
Ages.
But in Discourse upon this Subject, You have been pleased
frequently to insist, That I should by no means omit, to give
likewise, some Examples of the Mechanisme of Nature in
all the other Parts. The Performance whereof therefore,
next to the Obedience I owe to the Royal Society, is to
be looked upon, as a Due to the Authority which Your Judg∣ment
hath over me.
This I have said, that, if what is herein done, shall prove
acceptable unto Learned Men; they may know, To whom they
are oncemore to give their Thanks: After they have so often
done it, upon (a better score) the Publishing of Your own Ex∣cellent
Works. In which, there seems to be a Question, Whe∣ther
Your Continual Endeavours, to enlarge the Bounds of
Natural Knowledge, or Your Successes therein, have been
the Greater. So that, whereas Nobility in some, doth

only serve to lift them, like Jupiter's Satellits, out of
sight: You, by giving a greater Light, have drawn all
Mens Eyes upon You. And whilest there are many, in
all Ages, fond of Preheminency in the Conduct of Popular
Affairs; who yet rarely hit the Mark they aim at; or
aim at That they pretend: You have though fit, rather
to separate Your Self, to that more Innocent, and more
Noble Sort of Wisdom, which lieth, not in the Arts of
Conceiling, but in Discovering, the Truth of Things.
That we may have many to imitate You herein, can∣not
but be heartily wish'd by all, who regard the Honour
of their own Country; as it is, with much Zeal, by
Sir,
