RIght Honourable, allured by your Wisdome, and animated by your authority, the one ex∣pressed by your generall and matchlesse knowledge in the purer toungs, and the perfit vse and felicitie of your rea∣dings; the other in your execution in af∣fairs; policie, in counsaile; place in iudg∣ment; and credit with her most Roiall Maiestie: I haue (more audacious then wise) presumed to submit this weak labor of mine, to your iudgement to determin on, and authoritie to countenance: for what your iudgement shall winke at, the world

will applaud, and what your authority shall countenance, ignorant detraction dare not misconster; so then shadowed vn∣der the strong shield of your fauor, I net∣ther suspect my cause, nor feare mine ene∣mies; wax afraid of the curious, or aba∣shed at the enuious: accept therfore most Noble Lord this poore wreck of my wit, that hath no hope of eternitie but by your grace, nor defence from misreports but your name; neither any more felicitie then your allowance, and thinke of the writer as of him that giueth, what his rich will can for those fauours which his weake power may neuer requite. Thus wishing your honour that place in heauen which your charitie and pietie to all the lear∣ned iustly deserueth on earth, I humbly take my leaue, this fif∣teenth of April. 1596.
