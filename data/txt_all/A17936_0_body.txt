SIR,
THose that1 Sam. 2. 30. ho∣nour
God, God
will honor, and
so will godly
men: God will;
for he useth not to be behind
with any, neither will hee
with you: You have done
God much honour in setting
up such Lights in our Coun∣trey;
Ministers who both

Mat. 5. 19. Prius acti∣onem posu∣it mox Do∣ctrinam. Chrysost. Hem. 72. ad Pop. Antioch. Doe and Teach: They (as
Christ hath it) shall be called
great in the Kingdome of hea∣ven;
and so shall you. And
so will godly men honour
you, both Ministers and O∣thers:
Ministers, because
you have built us of our coat
some Synagogues: Others
(who had it not beene for
you, might have sate in the
Luke 1. 79.Shadow of Darknesse and
Death) for that they now
see best by their present mer∣cie,
what was their former,
and what would have beene
their future Misery. To save
one soule fom death is no∣ted
in the1 Tim. 31. Iam. 5. 20. Word to be an
honourable piece of service:
How great is your Honour
and comfort then? to whom
God hath given an Heart

and meanes to set up sundrie
Mat. 5. 14.Lights of it for the Saving
of many soules, in many
Parishes. Now as God and
GODS People will ho∣nour
you for providing that
which isIsa. 55. 2. BreadIohn 6. 55. indeed: So
you must conceive that Sa∣tan
will notLuke 10. 18▪ fall downe
from Heaven like lightning
thus without some stirre;
You doe plucke downe his
Kingdom, and he will pluck
at you, and you must, and
(I hope) doe provide for his
assaults. As for your Safety,
yourLuke 10▪ 20. Name being written
in Heaven (out of Satans
Iob 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8.walke) you stand2 Tim. 2. 19. sure;
TheIob. 10. 29. Father holds, and the
vers. 28.Sonne holds, and none shall
plucke you out of their
hands: But as touching your

inward Quiet, by GODS
Luke. 22. 31.Leave, Satan will take his
time to winnow you (not as
Chaffe) but as Wheat: Ex∣pect
it, he will doe what he
can (and he can doe some∣thing)
to interrupt your
Peace: He hathIam. 2. 19. no Peace
himselfe, and so he cannot
abide (as farre as he can doe
withall) that any should
have any: He durst and did
set upon, and vex the Lord
himselfe with the smoake of
anMatth. 4. 9. heavie Tentation: And
will he not, Dare he not,
let drive at us? Verily, when
we come to have thoseLuke 16. 11. true
Riches about us, and to be
in some spirituall strength,
(which usually is in our la∣ter
and moreHeb. 5. 14. experienced
age) it is usuall that GOD

should, and he often doth
suffer Satan; What? to beat
us? No! But yet to2 Cor. 12. 7. buf∣fet
us, as he did Saint Paul.
Wherefore, after some great
things done to GODS ho∣nour,
and Satans undoing,
we are then chiefest of all,
to looke for the houre of
Tentation, and to take the
best care we can, both for
our Safetie and Peace: This
is to fight, not so much
Ephes. 6. 12.with men, nor with1 Cor▪ 15▪ 32. beasts,
after the manner of men,
as withEphes. 6. 12. Principalities and
Powers: His Arrowes are
Ephes. . 10.firy, and have sorrow
enough in them, to make the
Heart of a Christian man to
Prov. 1. 25.stoupe: We are therefore,
all of us, by all meanes to
furnish our selves with such

2 Cor. 10. 5.Armes as may fit us in our
several occasions. And now
to helpe the weaker sort
of Christians, I have here
done somewhat that way,
which (what ever it be) I
doe here make bold to pub∣lish
it under your Name and
Countenance: To whom I
wish, as Saint Iohn did to
Gaius (theRom. 16. 23. Hoste of the
Church in his Time:)3 Ioh. 2. That
above all things you may
prosper, and be in health,
even as your soule prospe∣reth,
