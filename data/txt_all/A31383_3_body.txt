RIGHT HONOURABLE,
THe eminent and well deserved place your Honor holds in the Court of her Majesty, to whose gracious favour the first part of my Work was heretofore humbly con∣secrated, emboldens me in the adventure of this present address to your Honour; nor shall there, I hope, any notable dispro∣portion appear to the eyes of the judicious, that I thus purpose∣ly select your Honour to wait on her HIGHNES in a printed De∣dication, who at Court in so near a degree daily attend on her Sacred person.
The great and general applause with which France hath en∣tertained the whole Work in the original, gave encouragement to my pen to continue that first labour in the translation of this Second piece. Here may be seen the Court of a great and glo∣rious Prince, standing conspicuous to all eyes, like a goodly fa∣brick raised on four fundamental columns; two of which, the Souldier and the Sates-man, may not improperly seem to re∣flect on your Honour.
The first, when in the fair occasions of his Majesties fit em∣ployments, his just reason shall at any time call you forth into action: The second, in the present and frequent use he hath of your well matured counsels: Both which, by masculine courage and sober wisdom, aptly personated in CONSANTINE and BOE∣TIUS, are here presented to the life, as strong patterns for imita¦tion. It is your Honours patronage that thus brings them with the rest into the fruition of English air, and me by this op∣portunity into the grateful acknowledgement of many favours received from your Honour, which since I cannot make known by more real demonstrations, I offer this poor endeavour to supply the plentifull desires of him, who resolves to persist,
