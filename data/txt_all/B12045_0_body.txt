Posse & nolle, nobile.
HOnorable Sir, hauing ac∣cording to the directions of some of my best▪ min∣ded friends, finished my long expected labour; knowing this ripe iudging world to be full of enuie, euery one (as sound reason requireth) thinking his owne child to be fairest although an Aethiopian, I am emboldened to put my infant wit to the eye of the world vnder your protectiō,
 knowing that if Absurditie like a Theefe haue crept into any part of these Roems, your well-graced name will ouer-shadow these defaults, and the knowne Caracter of your vertues, cause the common back-bi∣ting enemies of good spirits, to be silent. To the VVorld I put my Child to nurse, at the expence of your fauour, whose glorie will stop the mouthes of the vulgar, and I hope cause the learned to rocke it asleepe (for your sake) in the bosome of good wil. Thus wishing you all the blessings of heauen and earth; lend.
