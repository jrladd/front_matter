SIR,

TO wait on YOU, the Persian MIRZA'S come
From the fair shades of his Elzum:
If all the wrongs that's Innocence opprest
Obtain one sgh from YOUR heroick Breast,
H'l think them , having preferr'd Him to
OUR Royall Knowedge; and perhaps done so
More then his Birth-right bad; for he hopes now
Not onely to delght, but profit YOU,
n warning to eschew what spoild his Right,
The Flatterer, and too powerfull Favourite.


In old Time, sacred was the Pots Pen,
And usefull to eternize worthy men:
To Rescue Vertue from the Furies spight,
d lift her Palm the hgher for the weight.
And I could wish it the next Ages Song,
Had MIRZA not die'd, He'd not liv'd so long:
His (written) Ghost looks brighter in his Ba
Then He had in the Crown of Persia.
So shall it be: Gain from His Losse shall flow,
And Life from Death, if YOU, Great SIR, say so.
