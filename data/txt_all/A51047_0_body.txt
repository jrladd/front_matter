Madam!
ALthough you might wonder, that such an one as I should presume to pre∣sent so small and mean a piece to your hands, and under your name to the
world, who have so many rare and excellent Workes of emi∣nent men, of your own alrea∣dy; yet be pleased to pass by my boldness, and to accept my Reasons that moved me so to doe, though slender. I had sometimes the honour to wait on, and preach to the Right ho∣nourable Lord, John Earle of Bridge-water, Baron of Brackly and Elsemere, &c. your Father, and then Lord President of the Marches of Wales, under King Charles the first, long since deceased; and had (I may truly say without ostentation) respect and favour above my expecta∣tion and deserts, and promi∣ses of preferment. I also well knew the Lady Catherine Courten your Sister deceased, very worthy to be remem∣bred and honoured, who was
pleased to accept of a small piece from my hand; also your great candor, piety and good∣ness, which God of his free grace hath inriched you with, for which I cannot but much honour you: and if your Lady∣ship shall be pleased to favour a poor Minister of Christ so far, as to let this mean piece come to your hand, and pass abroad under your Name, though mean and homely; I trust it may be of some use to others, and possibly to your self, seeing the truths of God are the same, though in a mean dress; and great souls must be nourished with the same sin∣cere milk of the word, go to Heaven in the same plain way of truth and holiness. Though this be but as Goats hair was, to make an outward covering to save the rich Furniture and
Curtains of the Tabernacle, and make other rich pieces ap∣pear with more lustre and beauty; this plain homely dish of spiritual food, may give you occasion to relish, value and desire others the more, and to feed more savourly on them. And so your Lady ship will oblige me to be most rea∣dy
MADAM,
