Most Reuerend,
THe argument of this discourse being religion, to whom could it be more fitlie presented then to your Grace, hauing (vnder his most Excellent Maiestie) worthi∣ly

the chiefe care hereof. Besides, the Author of this worke, whilest he liued, so much honoured your sincere and religious courses in managing the publique affaires of your eminent place, that had he thought of the publishing there∣of, no doubt but he would haue presumed to gaine some luster vn∣to it from your gracious Patro∣nage. Succeeding him in his tem∣porall blessings, I doe endeuour to succeede him in his virtues, duti∣full affection towards your grace, and prayers to the almightie, for the good of his Church, to in∣crease daily your honours, and happinesse.
