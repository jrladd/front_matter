MADAME,
IN the age of sacrifices, the truth of religion was not in the greatnesse, & fat of the offrings, but in the deuotion, and zeale of the sacrificers: Else, what could a handfull of gummes haue done in the sight of a hecatombe? or, how might I appeare at this altar, except with those af∣fections, that no lesse loue the light and witnesse, then they haue the conscience of your vertue? If what I of∣fer beare an acceptable odour, & hold the first strength, it is your value of it, which remembers, where, when, and to whom it was kindled. Otherwise, as the times are, there comes rarely forth that thing, so full of au∣thoritie, or example, but by assiduitie and custome, growes lesse, and looses. This, yet, safe in your iudgement (which is a SIDNEYS) is forbidden to speake more; lest it talke, or looke like one of the ambi∣tious Faces of the time: who, the more they paint, are the lesse themselues.
