YOƲR Lordship being so Illustrious an Ex∣ample of Heroick Love and Renowned Va∣lour; 'Tis but fit that at your Feet our Adventurous Lover and most Valiant

Hero should fall: and that Good-natur'd Pity, and Sweet Compassion that moved you to Espouse the Justest Cause of an injured Stranger, will encline you also to Patronise The Hi∣story of his wrongs and In∣juries; and your Lordship can∣not be an Enemy to the Au∣thor, if you are but a Friend and favourer of ARMADORUS.
