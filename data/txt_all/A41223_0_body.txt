CHronology, the Dis∣play of Ages past, is here presented to You; and Time, the wisest of all things, claims in its Transactions the wisest of
 Mens Judgments: To You therefore, Honoured SIR, do I make this Ad∣dress, it being of that ex∣cellency, that where Hi∣story is left imperfect, by this it is render'd compleat; so that not only the what, and where, but the when those Actions were per∣form'd, are particulariz'd; whereas in History, they are only glanc'd at in the Gross. Hence it was that Venerable Antiquity pay'd that Respect to Chrono∣logers of their Time: And I dare aver, that there is no Station where a Gentle∣man's
 Education has been concern'd, whether in Di∣vinity, Law, or Physick, but this part of Knowledge may be highly useful: And, as a Gentleman designing Court Preferment, especi∣ally in Affairs of State, it will imbellish him to that degree, to equallize, if not outvie most of his Contem∣poraries. As a Jewel there∣fore do I Recommend this Piece to You, worthy of Your Patronage, and Pro∣tection: And tho', SIR, I have not the Honour to be known to You, yet Fame has so transmitted to me, as
 to make the Choice in Your Person. The Merit of this Subject has sway'd my Bal∣lance, wholly to submit it to Your Censure, which I question not but according to the Calculation of the In∣genuous, it will find a safe Harbour, and favourable Reception; which will lay an eternal Obligation on,
SIR,
