SIR,
THIS Proiect
which I offer
to your Sacred

Maiesty, how euer (for
mine owne Vnworthi∣nesse
and Insufficiency,
or the almost last Re∣membrance
of the wea∣pon,
which I striue to
aduance) it may seeme
vnworthy of your Gra∣cious
view or Conside∣ration;
yet I am confi∣dent,
if you please to
lay your sacred eyes
vpon it, you will allow
it: For first, it will be

honourable to your
Kingdomes, through
the Multiplicitie of
good Souldiers; Terrible
to your opposers, when
they heare of such disci∣lin'd
Multitudes, and
not troublesome to your
Subiects; because it ney∣ther
puts them to one
penny of extraordinary
Expencee, takes from
them one day of theyr
necessary Affaires, nor

loades them with any
trouble or Vexation, ei∣ther
of Minde or Body;
Onely it tyes them to
the exercise and perfor∣mance
of that duty, to
which they are bound
both by the Lawes of
God, Nature, and the
wholesome Statutes of
this Kingdomes, as the
Treatise (I hope) will
witnesse, when your
Maiestie (or any by

your Maiestie appoin∣ted)
shall reade it;
In humble confidence
whereof, I rest
