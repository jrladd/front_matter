MADAM,
YOur Ladiship heard this Call of the Shulamite with a pious sympathy, and compassion; and since it took so well with you in the hearing, the first view of it is in gratitude returned to Your Ladiship's hand, and eye, that you may trie whether it be not the same that it was. And because this Call did not sound alike to every ear, but was judged of, as every head was more clear, or full of pre-possession: and could not reach to others, to whom it was more especially intended, but by the Eccho's of a sinister report: I must con∣fess I was not hard to be induced upon some per∣swasion,

to let it go unto the Press, that I might have a few Copies to distribute among some of these (in hope that their apprehensions might be some wayes rectified, or reduced by them) with∣out any further trouble to my self. So praying to Your Ladiship an encrease of all the blessings of this life; and at last, that full of years, and good works (which are your only studies) You may sweetly drop into a better; being that, that You do infinitely more desire. I humbly beg Your Ladi∣ship's pardon, and protection too,
MADAM,
