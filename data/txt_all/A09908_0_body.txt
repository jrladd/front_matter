LEt golden artists practice quaint imposture,
And study to a semblance of perfection,
Let Leopers sweate to shew the world their moisture,
We study not to Patrones for direction:
Unlesse the Honor that my lines shall owe
Can both protect vs, and approoue them too.


And such is thine, whose beames of Patronage
Doe heate alike in Iudgement, and in blood
Both, with pure fires deriu'd from parentage,
Preserued in the Arke of Fortunes flood,
When Neptune, and the sea gods did abette,
With Cynthia in her fullest veines aspect.


Thou wholesome Honour, Chaste Nobilitie,
Be in protection mine, as Generous,
Without distent through all thy auncestrie:
It was thy wont, Thou canst not erre in vs:
And for the Test sufficeth me to know:
Thy Iudgement best deserues my lines to owe.
