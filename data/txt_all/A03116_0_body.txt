AS diuers causes (Right Honourable, Right Wor∣shipfull, & my most worthy Patrones) do pro∣duce diuers effects: so diuers motiues do necessa∣rily incite & stimulate all men to diuers actions & inten∣tions. Now therfore there be 3. especiall motiues which do at this time induce, nay compell mee to dedicate these my poore Labours rather to your Honour and Worships, then to any others, to whom indeed the History it selfe might seeme more peculiarly to appertaine. First, because as this deluge of destruction intended by the barbarous butchers of Rome, had beene (indeed Catholike and) vniuersall to the whole kingdom: So your Honor and Worships being the high-topt Cedars of Lebanon, chiefe Magi∣strates of this famous City of London, especially beeing pious professors of Christs verity, should also haue had no small part, yea too too great and insupportable a portion

and ponderous burthen of sorrow and lamentation in this vnparaleld proiect of the Pouder-treason. The second Motiue is that since I amongest many hundred poore Or∣phanes fostered in that blessed house of Piety, Pitty, and Charity, that Sanctuary of your Cities safeguard, yea that Blocke-house of defence (as so I may terme it) against Heauens iustly deserued iudgements, which but for the due and daily prayers elsewhere, and thence forcibly and (no doubt) effectually ascending, we might expect to fall vpon vs: I meane Christs Hospitall whereof your Ho∣nour and Worships are principall Patrones, and most godly Gouernours, Et ô faelicia saecula, quae vos tales genuere Parentes. I, I say (as to Gods glory, your endles credit, and my no lesse comfort, I doe most thankefully ac∣knowledge, and ingenuously confesse) hauing suckt from the brests of your Charity, etiam ab origine prima, euen from mine infancy, the sweet milke of comfortable educa∣tion and pious institution, must thereby iustly also confesse that whatsoeuer is mine, is most properly yours, as being deriued from the ouer-flowing streames and radiant Sun∣beames of your bounty and benignity to mee exhibited. Therefore as acceptam refero is the Moones motto: so Quod recepi retribui, must with no lesse reciprocall due be mine: At, at, ô si, dignas persoluere grates opis es∣set meae, but alas, it is not (ô would to God it were) in my power condignely to remunerate your deserued merites. The third and last motiue or motion to this my dedication is, that since this translated Poeme is my first Essay and assay of what my weak faculty could effect, being indeed better meant then made, and finished with much defect & feeblenesse, defect I say of Rhetoricall flourishes, and fee∣blenes, in regard I haue beene but a meane proficient, if not a meere Trewant in the Schoole of the Muses, hauing e're cropt few or none of those odoriferous fragrant flow∣ers

which grow vpon, and most gorgeously doe garnish the pleasant banks of Parnassus, nor scarcely euer sipt of the aurifluous and mellifluous streames of Vrania's learned fountaine, hauing beene (oh too too soone) wained from the brests of my sacred Mother the most famous Vniuersity of Oxford, and therefore like a weakling so feebly walking, as scarce able to goe alone without your Honourable and Worshipfull protection, yet in regard it is the Primitiae of that meane Talent which the Lord by you his most blessed instruments hath lent vnto mee, which (whatsoe∣uer it is, as indeede it is but small) rather then I would hide it in the ground of ingratitude, I haue beene bould, embouldned by these considerations, but especially by the experimentall proofe of your Lordships and Worships wonted fauours, and most courteous dispositions in all hu∣mility to offer the same to your Honours and Worships pious Patronage and pervse, most submissely intrea∣ting you (Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, and my most worthy Mecaenaces) that as, ex paruis magna, ex vngue Leonem, & ex pede Herculem: A man may see day light through a small creuice: so you would bee pleased fauourably to accept this small present as a pledge of mine obliged duty, and as a Symbole of my seruice, which is, and euer shall be wholly at your Lordships and Worships command. Which your courteous acceptation I desire, not so much for mine owne sake, as for the Hi∣story it selfe, and that not so much for the manner as the matter, et res ipsa loquatur, let the matter it selfe speake for it selfe, num ruminari & recordari cordibus piorū omniū per vniuersam Britannie regionem, Whether all true hearted English protestants haue not iust cause to ru∣minate & record to all succeeding ages, the memory of this matchles Machination, & plotted Pouder-treason, wher∣of if I should heere enter into a copious discourse, it would

administer such an Ocean of ouerflowing turbulent waues of destruction, such a world of wonder and admi∣red accidents, and such a map of misery and mischiefe, yea such an endlesse boundlesse extent of greeuous aggra∣uations, that I might with the sorrowfull Troian Prince, Infandos renouare dolores, & totos vos in lachrymas resoluere, Tell you such a wofull tale as might with the Prophet Ieremy turne your heads into fountaines of teares: for Quis talia fando (nisi Papista crudelis) tem∣peret a lachrymis, none doubtlesse but the Pharaonicall hard-hearted Papist could choose but be exceedingly sor∣rowfull thereat; yea and heereby I might rather write a large Volume, than a short Epistle, for my part I cannot but horrescere referens, euen tremble at the relation thereof. But not to wrong your Lordships and Worships patience with too much prolixity in this Epistle, lest there∣by I seem to set a great paire of Gates to a little City, I will conclude of it, as a certaine graue Senator did of a former ancient Treason, farre inferiour to this, Repertum esse facinus, quod nec Poetae fingere, nec Histrio sonare, nec mimus imitari poterit, that by Heauens prouidence such a trecherous villany is discouered, as neuer any Poet could faine the like, no Stage-player euer Act the like, nor Mimus euer imitate the like, which since it is so dif∣ficult to describe, I will heerein imitate, though my selfe most vnskilfull, the skilfull Painter Timanthes of whom it is recorded, that being to describe and paint out the wofull Tragedy of Iphigema sacrificed to Diana, that when he was to portray & set out her Father Agamem∣nons most compassionate passion, and wofull countenance for her, that he confessing his Art insufficient to set him out deseruedly in his liuely lamentation, was faine to paint a vaile couering Agamemnons face, that so hee might leaue the extremity of his sorrow to the iudgement and

consideration of the behoulders: So I, vnskilfull I, con∣fessing my selfe (vnles I had the faculty of Maro or Meo∣nides) altogether vnable with hart or hand, with voice or vers to discouer the atrocrity & ineffable horror of this Romish barbarity, yea more than Scythian, Thracian in∣humanity; will couer the description therof with the vaile of Silence, and leaue it to the consideration of all that e∣uer knew or heard of the endlesse extent thereof: Most humbly desiring your Lordship and Worships with wonted protecting paternall fauour and courteous disposi∣tion, to vouchsafe your gentle acceptance of this plaine Poeme, the poore mite which my thankefull heart and dutifull hand, doe with all obliged gratitude offer vnto you, most submissiuely commending and committing the same to your worthy name & Patronage, your examples of Piety and charity, to the memory and imitation of po∣sterity, and your selues and soules to Gods all-sauing Grace, and all-sufficient Tuition in this life, neuer ceasing to pray for the blessing of Zaccheus on you and yours, euen eternall saluation in the life to come; which he grant that hath with the high price of his most precious bloud redee∣med vs, Christ Iesus the righteous, Amen.
