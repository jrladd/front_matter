Ladies,
I Present you here (as most resembling them) the Sports and Recreations of these great Ladies, who have so sublimed them by a Divine quality they have to con∣vert all into Vertue, as Midas did all he touched to Gold; whence their very Sports are as vertuous as others devotions: Those melancholly Spirits then enemies of all chearfulness, who call such Sports as these, but idle things, seem wholly ignorant of their first institution, and very signification of their names. For wherefore were they called Relaxations, Divertisements, and Re∣creations, but for relaxing our over bend∣ed thoughts, diverting our minds from cares and troubles of this life, and recreating our Spirits when tired and spent with World∣ly businesses. Whence to conclude, who∣ever in this mortal life can live without

them, must either be a God, or else a Beast, above, or else below Humanity.
And so much for their Sports; as for the Ladies themselves, I suppose they are so well known to all, as I need, in this Epistle, to say no more of them; but that they had always a high esteem for our English Ladies; and therefore, I doubt not, but you will have the like of them. Be pleased then Ladies, for their sakes, to accept a Dedi∣cation of this short Treatise, from him who is naturally an enemy of all that is long and tedious, a friend to these Sports and Recreations, an honorer and admirer of all your Nobler Sex, especially of all Fair and Vertuous Ladies like your selves.
