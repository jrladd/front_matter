Gentlemen,
THO' I was ever averse to the Printing of my Sermons, and in the very composure of them designed them only for the Pulpit, not the Press; to be heard, not read, and have therefore withstood all Im∣portunities of this nature; yet since you are now resol∣ved not to be denyed, and have agreed in your Verdict
 against me, I must submit, you must be obeyed. And indeed your steddy Loyalty in the most difficult Times, your indefatigable Zeal for the Church of England, your affectionate Union and Agreement amongst your selves; and lastly, your particular Respects and Friend∣ship towards my self, make it impossible you should be deny'd. A Church you reverence which doth not affect Novelties and Change, whose Doctrine is peaceable and uniform, and whose very Rites and Ceremonies are solemn and ancient. A Church, which sealed with the Blood of Martyrs, hath out-lived all the Plots of Hell and Rome, and is still the envy of her Enemies. A Church which hath dash'd the hopes and designs of all that hate her, and plainly shew'd that no Weapon form'd against her shall ever prosper. And may you long live to maintain and vindicate the Honour of our Church, to preserve our County in Peace and Union, and suppress Vice and Faction. And if the Publi∣cation of this Sermon may conduce any thing to the re∣moving of the Evils we either feel or fear; if it may help to make the Age better, or the Nation happier; if it may make but any one Person either a better Christi∣an, a better Subject, or a better Neighbour, I shall ne∣ver repent of the Commands that you have laid upon,
Gentlemen,
