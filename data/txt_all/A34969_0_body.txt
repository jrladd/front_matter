Sir,
IN this happy retrayt of a volun∣tary
banishment from the world,
(which by Gods goodnesse I have
made choice of) one principall de∣signe
of my thoughts is not to think
of the world; yet this cannot justifie
nor excuse me, if I should endea∣vour
or be willing to forget such a
Person, as you, and one to whom I
have so great obligations. Indeed
I should not comply with this my Vo∣cation,
if I did not oftentimes re∣member
you. To think of you, to
write to you, or converse with you,
are not worldly businesses: they may
become, and cannot but be advanta∣gious,
even in matter of spirit, to
the most abstracted persons: for

what will such an object represent
to them, but a true esteem of heaven,
gracefully set off by an heroicall con∣tempt
of earth; and this exemplifi∣ed
to the best advantage by one, who
in the middest of the greatest afflu∣ence
of all worldly contentments, in
the strength of his age, and vigor of
capacity, when he was most disposed
and inabled to tast whatever was
gustfull in them, yet had the succes∣full
courage to despise and renounce
them: And which is more admira∣ble,
one that still maintains a fearles∣nesse
of their skill to recall his liking
of them; since out of pure charity
to God, and his distressed servants,
he dares yet live in sight of them, a
stranger to them; one that (with
himself) consecrates all his own
riches to God, and onely interesses
himself in the wealth of others, to
the end that he may procure supplies
for those that want, and to inrich
those, who by supplying such wants,

can be perswaded to purchase eter∣nall treasures?
To you, SIR, therfore I addresse my
self, willing to take any, even this
poor occasion, by a very mean Present
to testifie to the world my cordial af∣fectionate
esteem of you & my thank∣full
acknowledgment of your great
goodnesse and charity towards me,
expressed by a considerable pension,
without any intercession of friends,
voluntarily offered, and out of your
own prison and straitnesse freely
sent me immediately after my Con∣version,
though a meer stranger to
you, yet sufficiently recommended by
relinquishing of Friends, Estate, and
Country, for that Religion's sake,
which before had made the same con∣quest
over you: And since expres∣sed
by many testimonies of your
friendly benignity and confidence.
I take leave therefore to present
unto you this Book, as it is now a
second time published. The subject

of it is the story of my uncertainties
and wandrings; and in conclusion,
my fix'd establishment in the same
solid foundation of Truth with you,
which gained e first the happinesse
of your affection. And I pretend in
this second publication to a further
entrance into the same affection,
not for any worth of the Treatise,
but onely for the testimony that I, of
mine own accord, give publikely of
my declining, to consider mine own
fame or esteem with men, in a mat∣ter
that respects, though only the cir∣cumstances
of divine Truth; Since
the ground why I renew the impres∣sion
is to signifie, that I detest to
maintain, with a perverse constancy,
even the smallest phrases or words,
which I could suspect might be ob∣noxious
to offence or misconstruction.
I cannot call it a Book of Contro∣versies,
though the essentiall points
of Catholike Religion be asserted
in it: or if of Controversies, it is

principally against those that unne∣cessarily
multiply them.
Whatsoever it is, a poor Present it
is, God knowes; and yet even in that
respect lesse unacceptable to you, who
despise riches; and more becoming
me, whose profession is poverty. I
pretend to no reward, or if any, I
am content that your pardon should
be my reward: Yet I must recall my
words; I do indeed humbly expect
and beg a great reward, no lesse then
the richest kind of Almes, Prayers:
and the best of that best sort of
Almes, your prayers; mine for you
have been alwayes due, since I knew
you; and, God willing, shall be most
faithfully paid at Gods holy Altar;
for I am, in truth of heart,
Paris, 21.
