SIR,
THis Second Edition of SYLƲA, after more than a Thousand Co∣pies had been Bought up, and dis∣pers'd of the First Impression, in much lesse time than two Years space (which Book-sellers assure us is a very ex∣traordinary thing in Volumes of this bulk) comes now again to pay its Homage to your Se∣rene Majesty, to whose Auspices alone it owes the favourable Acceptance which it has recei∣ved in the World. But it is not That alone, which it presumes to tell your Majesty, but to ac∣quaint You, that it has been the sole Occasion of furnishing your almost exhausted Dominions, with more (I dare say) than two Millions of Timber-Trees; besides infinite Others, which

have been Propagated within the three Nations, at the Instigation, and by the Direction of this Work; and that the Author of it is able (if need require) to make it out, by a competent Vo∣lume of Letters, and acknowledgments, which are come to his hands from several Persons of the most eminent Quality; many of them Illustrious, and divers of them unknown to him, in justifica∣tion of what he asserts, which he the rather pre∣serves with the more care; because they are Te∣stimonials from so many honourable Persons, of the Benefit they have receiv'd from the Endea∣vours of the Royal Society, which, now adayes, passes through so many Censures; but, she has yet your Majesty for her Founder and Patron, and is therefore the less concern'd; since no man of worth can likely speak ill of an Assembly, which your Majesty has thought fit to dignifie, by so signal a Relation to it.
It is now about five years past, that your Maje∣sty was pleas'd to declare your favourable Accep∣tance of a Treatise of Architecture which I then presented to you, with many gracious expressions, and that it was a most useful Piece. Sir, That Encouragement (together with the success both of the Book it self, and of the first Edition of this) has animated me to make a second Oblation to you of these Improvements: Nor was it cer∣tainly, without some Provident Conduct, that we have been thus solicitous to begin as it were, with Materials for Building, and Directions

to Builders; if due Reflections be made on that deplorable Calamity, the Conflagration of your Imperial City; which neverthelesse by the Bles∣sing of GOD, and your Majesties gracious Influence, we despair not of seeing Rise again, a New, and much more Glorious PHOE∣NIX.
This TRIBUTE, I now once more lay at the Feet of our ROYAL FOƲNDER: May your Majesty be pleas'd, to be Invok'd by that no Inglorious TITLE in the profound∣est Submissions of
Gracious Sir, 
Says-Court Aug. 24 1669.
