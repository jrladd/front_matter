SIR,
I Beleeve you
to bee such
Patron of Ver∣tue,
that if this Treatise
had the least probabi∣lity

of cherishing Vice,
my Conscience durst
not admit a thought of
this Dedication to
your Majesty.
But my own Reason
(seconded by better
approbations) assures
mee these Disquisitions
and Prayers are like to
beget grace in those
where it was not, and
confirm it where it was.
And being so usefull,
I dare not doubt your
Patronage of this child,

which survives a Father
whose utmost abilities
were (till death darke∣ned
that great light in
his soule) sacrificed to
your service.
But, if I could questi∣on
your willing prote∣ction
of it, I might
strengthen my Petition
for it, by an unquestio∣nable
commendation
of the Authors pub∣lisht
Meditations, in
most of which (even
those of Poetry begun

in his youth) there are
such tinctures of Piety,
and Pictures of devout
Passions, as gain'd him
much love, and many
Noble Friends.
One of that number
(which is not to bee
numbred) was the
Religious, Learned,
Peaceable, Humble Bi∣shop
of Armagh; whom I
beseech God to blesse,
and make your Maje∣sty
and him, in these
bad, sad times, instru∣ments

of Good to this
distracted, distemper'd
Church and State.
This is my unfained
Prayer; and I doubt
not but all that wish
well to Sion, will seale
it with their Amen.
