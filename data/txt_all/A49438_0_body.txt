SIR,
THE great Worth of the Deceas'd, who
is the Lamented Subject of the follow∣ing
Poems, and the great value You had for
His iestimable Composures, will, We hope,
render the Present which is made to You of
'em, more acceptable. You have too great
a knowledge of His Merit, to want any thing
to be said here in it's behalf, and are so un∣willing
to hear any Panegyric on Your own,
that We shall omit the Common way of De∣dications.
And, since it is no News to those
who have the Honour of Your Acquain∣tance,
to be told, You are the Delight of
the Country You live in; that Your Tem∣per
is without Affectation, Your Behaviour
Courteous; Your Generosity bounded with
Discretion; and that You have all the Po∣liteness
of the City in an Island so remote
from it. We shall only beg the favour of Your
Patronage for what is Consecrated to the
Memory of a Gentleman, who when Living,
deserv'd more than one Mecaenas, and beg
leave to Subscribe,
SIR,
