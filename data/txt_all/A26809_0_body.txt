SIR,
I Have complied with
your desire in publish∣ing
the following Ser∣mon
upon the Death of
your Dear Brother. The
Soveraign Disposer of all
things has been pleased
to take away in a few
Years several Persons
very near to you in the
Consanguinity of Nature,

and younger than your
Self: a solemn Call to
remember you, that the
last Day of your pre∣sent
Life is approaching
that will be attended with
its Night, and to excite
you to prepare for your
great Change from Time
to Eternity. You have
indeed peculiar Obliga∣tions
and Encouragement
to be Religious in a de∣gree
of Eminence; whose
Father was so bright a
Light, and Guide to all

his Relations in the E∣verlasting
Way, by his
Holy Counsels and Hea∣venly
Conversation. Of
him I could speak many
excellent Things, were
not his Goodness so uni∣versally
known, that De∣traction
it self could ne∣ver
fasten an unworthy
Imputation upon him.
It shall suffice to give
this short Character of
him sincerely: He was
adorn'd with all Di∣vine

Graces, and by
their conspicuous Exercise
was singularly eminent
among the Saints. He
made so particular an
Application of that ge∣neral
Precept, Thou
shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy Heart,
and with all thy Soul,
with all thy Strength,
and with all thy Mind,
as if it had been solely
given to himself: the
Love of God inflam'd his
Heart, and shin'd in his

Life. This made him
one day in a week (be∣sides
that which is Sacred
by Divine Appointment)
to withdraw himself from
the Business of the World,
that he might more free∣ly
enjoy Communion with
the blessed Object of his
Spiritual Desires. His
Piety was in Conjuncti∣on
with all those Ver∣tues
that are requisite to
accomplish a Christian:
Temperance and Purity
of Manners, Justice and

Equity in his Commerce
with others, and those
Vertues that cast a more
lively Lustre, and have
an attractive force upon
Men. A rare Humility, an
amiable Meekness, conde∣scending
Affability and
Sweetness, compassionate
Charity and Beneficence
to the Souls and Bodies
of Men, were really ex∣hibited
in his Deport∣ment
and Actions. He
was so lovely in his Con∣versation,
so loving to

all, that he was beloved
of all. The uniform and
regular Tenor of his Life
obtain'd this Testimony,
that was given to our
Blessed Master, he did all
things well. A constant
Serenity reigned in his
Countenance, the visible
sign of the Divine Calm
in his Breast, the Peace of
God that passes Under∣standing.
And for an
entire Conformity to our
Saviour, that the Image
of his meek suffering

Evil, as well as his zea∣lous
doing Good, might
radiantly appear in this
chosen Saint, the Divine
Providence call'd him
forth to a very sharp
Tryal; for being under
the afflicting Severities
of the Stone, and by
the Advice of his dear
Friends perswaded to sub∣mit
to the dangerous Re∣medy
of Cutting, with
what resigned Submissi∣on
did he yield himself
to the Will of God?

With what Tranquil∣lity
did he expect the
issue either of surviving or
dying? You remember
his words before that ter∣rible
Operation, When I
walk through the Valley
of the shadow of Death,
I will fear no Evil:
When so great a Wound
was made in his Flesh as
an open passage for Death
to enter, and such cruel
pains followed as struck
the Spectators with trem∣bling,
he endur'd them with

an inspired Patience and
Constancy. Thus God
was pleased to perfect
dear his Servant by Suf∣ferings.
Your descent from such
a Father should be a
powerful Incentive to you
to imitate his admirable
Example: you should con∣sider
whose Name you
bear: to be a faint Copy of
so bright an Original, as
it is below your Duty,
so I am perswaded will

not satisfy your Affections.
Methinks a sacred Ambi∣tion
should inflame you to
excel in all Holiness and
Godliness, that the living
Image of your Father's
Graces may be clearly
visible in your Person
and Conversation. Pro∣ceed,
dear Sir, in the
everlasting way, where∣in
you are so happily ad∣vanced;
be always aspi∣ring,
and with Zeal en∣deavouring
to obtain the
Coelestial Prize. I un∣feignedly

recommend your
self, your Excellent Lady,
and your Family to the
Divine Blessing. I am
with great Respect,
Sir,
Your affectionate and
faithful Servant,
