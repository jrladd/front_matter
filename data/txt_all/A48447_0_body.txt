Honour'd Sir,
THE first and last time you gave
me the favour to kisse your
hands, since my return from
the Southern and Western
parts of the World, you were
pleased to make some enquiries of me,
concerning the Iland of Barbados, a
place you much desired to be satisfied
in: But, by reason my stay was but short,
I could give You but a sleight and
scant relation, of the many particulars
you were desirous to be informed in;
so that for the present, I rather poynted
at, then gave a home-satisfaction, to
what was most fit to be known, of the
Beauties and Riches of that place. Where∣upon
you were pleased to impose on me
a task, (very unfit for me to undertake,
being one altogether unlettered) to de∣liver

in writing, the sum of all I knew,
concerning that Iland. Though I were
sufficiently conscious of mine own ina∣bilities;
yet, my obedience to your com∣mands,
led me on, to give you a private
satisfaction, in a thing you so earnestly
desired, which was all I aimed at: But,
upon perusall of it, you were pleased to
give me a far greater encouragement, then
I expected, with your allowance for the
publishing of it, for the common benefit
of those, who intend to spend their times,
and venture their fortunes upon such un∣dertakings▪
so that I wanted but means or
friends, for the putting it forth; but, those
two being absent, it has layne in the dark
this two years. You were then likewise
pleased, to cast your eyes upon some pieces
of Limning, which I had done since my
return, (by my memory only) of the
Trees, Plants, and Fruits, which I had seen
growing upon that place; things in them∣selves
of infinite beauty, but losing much
of their life and lustre, by my ill handling;
yet, you were pleased to afford them an
approbation, beyond their value, which
gave me an ambition, to do somewhat in
that kinde, more like a Master; and to that
purpose, was designing a piece of Land∣scape,
and one of Story, wherein I meant
to expresse the postures of the Negres, in
their severall kinds of Sports and Labours;

and with it, the beauties of the Vegeta∣bles,
that do adorn that place, in the high∣est
perfection I could: But presently after,
being cast into Prison, I was deprived both
of light and lonelinesse, two main helpers
in that Art; and so being disabled to dis∣cern
or judge of Colours, I was compelled
to expresse my designes in Black and
White: So that now you will finde expo∣sed
to your view, a piece of wild Grotesco,
or loose extravagant Drolorie, rather than
a Regular piece of Story or Landscape.
Rough drawn, and unproportionably
stell'd, though it be, I here present it; which,
though it be but as a Drop to the Ocean,
or a Mite to the treasury of your Know∣ledge;
yet, in obedience to your commands,
which have a powerfull operation on me, I
could do no lesse then give you an account
of what I had done, howweak and unperfect
soever. And so begging pardon for the
faults committed, both in the Language,
and ill contrivance of my Discourse, I
humbly take my leave, and rest.
Honoured Sir,

Upper Bench Prison,
July 12th 1653.
