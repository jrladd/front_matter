SVndry times weying with
my selfe (Right honora∣ble)
what small account is
made of poore Schollers at
this day, and howe fruit∣lesse
their greatest labours
bee: I resolued with my
selfe, neuer to publish any
thing in print hereafter. Yet notwithstanding after
manie stormes, all mixed with vnnaturall showres,
descending from the idle braine of sundrie fruit∣lesse
wittes: I seeing manie stinging Nettles a∣mongst
the sweete Roses, erecting their heades higher
then all the holesome hearbes in the Garden: And
that a ridiculous generation newly come ashore into

the world, are not ashamed to affirme, that these stink∣ing
weeds, are those sweete lillies named by our Saui∣our
Christ: that they will digge vp the garden a new:
that they will reforme the supperstitious braunches,
of the sweete auncient welblowne Rose of England.
That they will pull downe the winepresse, and leuell
the ground a new, by a new line: that they will build
a new wine presse, of a new fashion, yelding new wine
neuer seene or tasted by anie Christian heretofore. Af∣ter
these great puffes of this fruitles wind, had etonce
resounded in mine eares, beating it selfe with such out
ragious blastes against the walles of the Church that
it maketh the strongest pillers thereof to quake and
tremble: Though I be the meanest of manie thousands
 this cause concerneth, yet knowing that it di∣rectly
belongeth to the maintaining of true religion,
and the holie worship of Almightie God, I could not
with bold my pen anie longer, from refuting so dan∣gerous
and damnable an opinion. It is a greeuous
thing by sinnes of infirmitie to offend Almightie God:
but openly and obstinately to affirme, that palpable
darkenes is cleare light: that euill is good, and good is
euill: that sacrilegious deadly sinne, is godly zeale, &
that openly before the face of his aeternall Maiestie: Is
the true inheritance of that treble woe oft denounced
in the Scriptures. This mooued me (Right honoura∣ble)

in regard of mine humble dutie to your Honour,
and the publike commoditie of manie Christian soules
(which once tasting this sweete baite, might easilie be
entised to eat vp sinne as it were bread) to forewarne
all those, which shall read this plaine simple treatise,
that they wash their secrete thoughts, from this most
heinous sinne: which who so practiseth, with bloudie
heart he offereth violent hands euen vnto the bosome
of the sacred spouse of Iesu Christ. Amongest all the
creatures of this world, God hath giuen man onely an
vnder standing soule adorned with sundrie heauenly
vertues, of which there is none greater, none more ex∣cellent
and diuine, more acceptable to God, more ho∣norable
in the sight of men, than is his holy worshippe,
religiously celebrated in his holy Temple. Ouer the
which place, his care hath beene alwaies such, his eie
so vigilant, his prouidence so continuall: that neither
the sweet intising cups of worldly pleasure could at a∣nie
time bewitch it, nor the deuouring sword of firie
persecution consume it. But as the little ship, whilom
welneere perished with the outragious tempest, at the
voice of our Sauior, was presently safe in quiet calme;
euen so when subtle worldlings seeke either by force or
pollicie to ouerthrow the little Church of Christ: Thē
the Lord stirreth vp some valiant Gedeon, some migh∣tie
Constantine, some true Christian knight, whose

Name and Nature do yeeld a sweet consent to support
his sauiour & therewith to withstand the furie of his
enimies. Who daily seeke by new deuises, thrise fined
in the fire of subtle pollicie, so to darken the cleare son
of true Christianity, that the house of God may nomore
bee seene, and that all the fountaines belonging to the
same, in one day may be cleane dryed vp.
Sith then the glistering cloud of sacrilegious zeale
hath spred it selfe so larglie ouer our horizon, and so
eclipsed the true radiant sunne, that in steade of the
daie spring, which from an high hath visited vs with
true light vnto saluation: the wiser sort doe plainlie
perceiue that the houre of darkenes now hangeth ouer
our heades, and that the daie of iniquitie hath alrea∣die
dawned, in which Sathan by the secrete misterie
of iniquitie, beginneth to worke those ruthfull strata∣gemes
against the Church of Christ, which he hath bin
manie yeares in deuising: I cannot but write truely,
that which the Clergie with the whole realme confesse
plainely: That we render immortall thankes vnto
Almightie God, for preseruing her most Roiall Ma∣iestie
so miraculouslie vnto this daie, giuing her a
most religious heart (the mirror of all Christian prin∣ces)
once and euer wholy consecrated to the maintai∣ning
of his diuine worship in his holy Temple.
From this cleare Christall fountaine of heauenlie

vertue, manie siluer streames deriue there sunárie
passages so happelie into the vineyarde of the Lord,
that neither the flaming fury of outward enimies, nor
the scorching sacrilegious zeale of domesticall dissi∣mulation,
can drie vp anie one roote planted in the
same, since the peaceable reigne of her most Roial Ma∣iestie.
Of these cleare Christall currents, I haue vewed
the most, and doubt not but that I haue tasted of one
of the best, sith in the greatest heat in sommer, it is ne∣uer
drie, in the hardest winter, not once congeled, in
the greatest tempest, alwaies calme, in the greatest di∣stresse,
it yeeldeth iuice of sweetest comfort. Herewith
oftentimes being well refreshed: when I looke backe,
and in my selfe beholde the great comfort which both
our vniuersities dailie receiue from your honour: I
account it one of the most speciall blessings of the Lord,
that in his great wisedome he hath reserued your Ho∣nor
vnto these daies, wherein Sathan streacheth al the
strings of his wit, reuiueth all his pollicies, practiseth
all his treacheries, against the poore distressed Church
of Iesus Christ. He vseth force by forraine enimies a∣brode,
and secrete vndermining, by smoth dissemblers
at home. Herewith hee hath displaied his banner be∣fore
the gates, & giuen a special sūmons to the temple
it self.  malis, Sed contrà audentior
ito. Let the Lords knights now arme themselues, with

true Christian courage. Let them gird there sword v∣pon
their thigh, let thē awake with the worthie Sam∣son,
and aduenture the battaile with Iulius Caesar,
who where the greatest danger was, there in person he
would giue the first charge: Non est nisi in summis
victoria, In greatest dangers, true vertue atchie∣ueth
the greatest victorie. And surely if we behold the
poore innocent Church all naked in the midst of hir ar∣med
enimies, daily woūded by some, betraed by others,
cōtemned of the most. If we looke into the world & see
the smal comfort which poore schollers haue common∣ly
when they come abrode, the counterfeit curtesie, the
seeming friendship, the smiling looks, the double words
the single deedes, the smoth promises, the doubtfull de∣nials:
We cannot but confesse, that hee which in this
vncertainty continueth a certaine & asure Patron,
Arduam virtutis calcauit viam, sed tamen glo∣riosam:
He hath entred the hard way of perfect ver∣tue,
but yet that which leadeth, vnto true honor. He
which with the light of heauenly wisedome, and the
true integrite of a right noble heart, hath entred this
way, at no time diuerting out of the same ether by flat∣terie
of fauning friends, or feare of priuie nipping eni∣mies,
or by double danger proceeding from thē both:
He it is whom God loueth, whome the better sort doe
striue to imitate, whose memorie the posteritie shal ce∣lebrate,

for whom we dailie pray, and whom I honor
with my hart. In this perfect resolution, I haue pres∣umed
to dedicate this my Dissuasiue vnto your Ho∣nour,
at this day a most assured friend to the church of
Christ, a special benefactor to our Vniuersitie, and my
most honorable & singuler good Patron, whō I desire
to gratifie in the best manner I can deuise. Which I
haue done the rather, to shew my duetie to the com∣mon
vveale, and the sincere affection vvich I beare
to your most rare vertue: assuring my selfe, that you
will take it in good part, as from him which with∣out
all flatterie and with intire affection, doth
beseech your creator to bestow that v∣pon
you, vvhich your most honoura∣ble
heart doth desire.
