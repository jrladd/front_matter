Sir,
THough a Sranger to your Person, I am no Stranger in my thanke∣full Heart (to the All-glorious Majesty of Heaven) for such as you: You whose knowne worth, & inward Candor, nor frownes, nor Flatterie, could ever force from its true Good∣nesse for the generall good. Monster Ingratitude cannot say I flatter; Witnesse this Cities approba∣tion, unanimous consent, free choice of you that are, (the All-guiding hand of Heaven be praised) free
from the aspersion, Spots and staines of this Worlds Vicious and Ambitious Greatnesse. Let it not then seeme strange, that I (incouraged by your Noble Vertues) have here made bold, (out of an honest heart) Right worthy Sir, unto your selfe to Dedicate this Booke. It is a knowne Maxime to approved Iudgements, that Illicita non pro∣hibere consensus erroris est, which being the full scope of this my endeavour, intended only for the ex∣altation of Vertue, detestation of Vice, and like the Sea-mans Compasse to direct soules from the dangerous Passage indirect. The Scylla and Cha∣rybdes Shelfes and Rocks of this uncleane and most uncertaine Ocean of the World. This being my intent, (as caveats against sinne not to be cavilled against, but by guilty Persons.) Accept then (ver∣tuous Sir) this my good will, take it from him, who (leaving you and yours, all your faire Actions and occasions present to the All-pure God which never leaves his) remaines
