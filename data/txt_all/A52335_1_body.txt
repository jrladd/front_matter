MY LORD,
THE first Part of this
Work having taken
Shelter under the Pa∣tronage
of our Me∣tropolitan,
this naturally flies to
your Lordship: From whom I
have good Encouragement to
hope for as kind a Protection. I
have great Reason to be fond of
any Opportunity of making my
grateful Resentments of your Lord∣ship's
Favours known to the
World; and I heartily wish this
little Book may be look'd upon
as any part of a suitable Return.
I can honestly boast of your Lord∣ship's

Approbation of what I have
already publish'd, and of your
Encouragement to proceed: Tho'
(give me leave, My Lord, here
to repeat it) those are Words
which sometimes appears in De∣dications
without any thing of the
caress'd Patrons Knowledge or
Allowance. I dare not presume
to enlarge upon your Bounty and
Goodness to the Author; since
most of the Instances I should give
of 'em are so many Testimonies
of your Lordship's Desire to fol∣low
the Directions of your Great
Master, in bestowing your Bene∣fits
in Secret. May God be gra∣ciously
pleas'd to reward openly
what you have thus done for this
Church and Diocese, as well as for,
MY LORD,
