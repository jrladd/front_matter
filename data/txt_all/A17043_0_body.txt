BE pleas'd (great Lord) wheÌ„ vnderneath the shades
Of your delightfull Brams-hill, (where the spring
Her flowers for gentle blasts with Zephire trades)
Once more to heare a filly Shepheard sing.
Yours be the pleasure, mine the Sonneting;
Eu'n that hath his delight; nor shall I need
To seeke applause amongst the common store
t is enough if this mine-oaten Reed
Please but the eare it should; I aske no more.
Nor shall those rurall notes which heretofore
Your true attention grac'd and wing'd for fame
mperfect lye; Obliuion shall not gaine
Ought on your worth, but sung shall be your name
o long as England yeelds or song or Swaine.
Free are my lines, though drest in lowly state,
And scorne to flatter but the men I hate.
