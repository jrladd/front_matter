AFter that I had
turned into Englishe, this
godlie, learned, and comfor∣table
Treatise of Maister
 Beza, of God his eternal Electiō and Pre∣ination:
there came to my handes another
e of the same, Englished by that learned
 godlie Father, Maister VVhytting∣
and printed at Geneua in the daies of
ne Marie. Herevppon I determined
 my selfe to haue staied the setting foorth
is my Translation, as a thing both neede∣
and also not without suspition of great
, and ouerwell lyking of my selfe, to vn∣ke
the translation of that worke, which
lreadie so learnedlie translated, by so
 and learned a Father. But as on the
e vnto mee, which (as God knoweth) ne∣uer

saw it, it was as it had not at all been trā∣slated:
So since the first Englishing of it, by
Maister VVh it hath beene enlarged by the
Authour: and also deuided into abetter order
of Chapters: euerie one of them consisting of
briefe sentences, and as it were articles: wher∣of
euerie seuerall member, is prooued with
plaine and plentifull testimonies of the worde
of God set downe directlie after the ende of e∣uerie
sentence: the benefite that I am perswa∣ded
maie come vnto the Godlie Reader by my
trauaile, hath caused mee to suffer this my
translation also to come abroade, and that the
rather, because it hath passed the censure aud
iudgement of the godlie and learned, who haue
thought that the publishing of it maie be much
profitable and comfortable vnto God his chil∣dren.
This my simple labour, such as it is I of∣fer
vnto you (right VVorshipfull) as a small
token of a thankefull minde towards your VV
for your manifolde friendship and curtesies,
sundrie waies declared towards mee: desiring
you to accept it as a gifte that proceedeth from
such a one, who hartelie wisheth you well, and
would also if abilitie serued, presēt you with 
better. Thus crauing both pardon for my bold∣nesse,

and also requesting your fauourable ac∣epting
of my simple trauaile: I cease from fur∣her
troubling your VV. with my rudenesse.
aying God to enriche you with the plentifull
crease of the giftes of his spirite, and to con∣inue
you in health and welfare, both of soule
nd bodie, to his honour and glorie, to your
owne ioye and comfort, and to the benefite
and commoditie of your natiue Coun∣treie
for Christes sake.
From Tunbridge this last of Iune 1576.
