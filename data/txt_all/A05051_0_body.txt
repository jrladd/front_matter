RIght worshipfull, this small trea∣tie (written in Dutch,
shewing a late voyage performed by certain Hollanders to the
Islandes of Iaua, part of the East Indies) falling into
my handes, and in my iudgement deseruing no lesse commendati∣on then
those of our Countrey men, (as Captaine Raimond in the
Penelope, Maister Foxcroft in the Marchant Royall,
and M. Iames Lanca∣ster in the Edward Bonauenture, vnto the
said East Indies, by the Cape de Bona Sperance, in
Anno 1591. as also M. Iohn Newbery, and Raphael
Fich ouer land through Siria from Aleppo vnto
Ormus and Goa, and by the said Rapha∣el Fich
himselfe to Bengala, Malacca, Pegu, and other places in Anno
1583. as at large appeareth in a booke written by M. Richard
Haclute a Gentleman very studi∣ous therein, & entituled the
English voyages) I thought it not vnconuenient to translate the same into
our mo∣ther tongue, thereby to procure more light and encou∣ragement to such
as are desirous to trauell those Coun∣tries, for the common wealth and
commoditie of this Realme and themselues. And knowing that all men are 
 not like affected, I was so bold to shrowd it vnder your
worships protection, as being assured of your good di∣sposition to
the fauouring of trauell and trauellers, (and whereby it hath pleased God to
aduance you to that honourable title, which at this present you beare) and
so not fitter for the protection of any then your selfe: and as a poore
friend wishing all happines and prospe∣rity in all your valiant actions.
Which if it please your worshippe to like and accept, it may procure the
pro∣ceeding in a more large and ample discourse of an East
Indian voyage, lately performed and set forth by one Iohn
Hughen of Linschoten, to your further delight. Wherewith
crauing your fauor, & beseeching God to blesse your worship, with
my good Ladie your wife, I most humbly take my leaue:
This 16. of Ianuarie.
1597.
