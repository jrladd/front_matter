May it please Your Majesties,
HAVING already presumed to offer to Your Majesties Sacred Hands, a mean Present, (in a small Treatise,) Entitled, NOSCE TEIPSƲM, wherein I have endeavoured to give some account, how I have spent my Holy Days, since I have been Clerk of the Company of GROCERS; with the Reasons and Arguments inducing me to join in the Communion of our National Church, when I had examined and tryed all other different Persuasions.
Your Majesties Gracious Acceptance of that, together with You my Dread Sove∣reign's

vouchsafing to become our Supreme Master, have embolden'd me to offer at Your Majesties Sacred Feet the following Sheets, as the Product of my Working Days in the same Service.
I may not hope Your Majesties should spare time to look farther; but I most humbly be∣seech Your Majesties to cast Your Gracious Eyes on the few following Lines, which I have recorded in our Register, immediately before the entry of such Your Majesties Gracious Condescention: Whereby I humbly Hope it will plainly appear, no other Company in London, might so justly presume, to beg the Honour of Adoption by a Crowned Head.
That Your Majesties Sacred Names may be Illustrious, from this little Orb, through∣out all Your Majesties Dominions, to the ends of the Earth, shall be the daily, and hearty Prayers of,
