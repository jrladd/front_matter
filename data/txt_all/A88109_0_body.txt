SIR,
HAving offered A Sacrifice of praise to God, for that great deli∣verance which was wrought for the Ministry, in preventing the subtile designes of such, as would have subjected the Gospell to the Law: In the next place I waited for an occasion, whereby I might shew my selfe gratefull to the Instruments that procured this liberty for us, and broke the snares from off our feet, while we were almost sinking under the burthen of legall triall.
