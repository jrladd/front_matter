MY most honorable good Lords for as much as it hath pleased God, not only to bestow vp∣on your Lordships, the excellent gifts of natures bene∣fite, but hath also beutified the same with such speciall ornamentes of perfecti∣on: As that thereby the mindes and attentiue industrie of all, haue no small regard vnto your honorable proceedings. And so much the rather, because to the great content of all her maiesties most louing subiectes, it hath pleased her high∣nes in her stately regard of gouernment, to make choise of your honours as speciall members in the regall disposition of the mightinesse of her imperiall commaund: Emboldeneth me among the rest to humble my selfe at your honorable feete, in presenting vnto the fauour of your ex∣cellent Iudgementes, this short treatise of the worldes Hydrographicall bands. And knowing that not onely your renowned places, but also the singularitie of your education, by the prudent

care of your noble progeniters, hath and still doth indce and drawe you to fauour and imbrace, Whatsoeuer beareth but a seeming of the Com∣mon weales good: Much more then, that which in substantiall truth shalbe most beneficiall to the same. I am therefore the more encouraged not to slacke this my enterprise, because that through your honorable assistance when in the ballance of your wisdomes this discouery shall haue indif∣ferent consideration, I knowe it will be ordered by you to bee a matter of no small moment to the good of our Countrie. For thereby wee shall not onely haue a copious and rich vent for al our na∣turall and artificiall comodities of England, in short time by safe passage, and without offence of any, but also shall by the first imployment re∣tourne into our Countrey by spedie passage, all Indian commodities in the ripenes of their per∣fection, whereby her Maiesties Dominions should bee the storehouse of Europe, the nurse of the world, and the glory of nations, in yelding all forrayne naturall benefites, by an easie rate: In communicating vnto all, whatsoeuer God hath vnto any one asigned: And by the increase of all nations, through the mightinesse of trade. Then should the merchant, tradesman, and poore ar∣tificer, haue imployment equall to their power and expedition, whereby what notable benefites would growe to her Maiestie, the state, and co∣munaltie, I refer to your perfect iudgementes. And for that I am desirous to auoyde the con∣tradiction

of vulgar conceipts, I haue thought it my best course, before I make profe of the cer∣taintie of this discouerie, to lay downe whatsoe∣uer may against the same be obiected, and in the ouerthrowe of those conceipted hinderances the safenes of the passage shall most manifestly ap∣peare, which when your wisdomes shall with your patience peruse, I doe in no sort distruct your fa∣uorable acceptance and honorable asistance of the same. And although for diuers considerati∣ons I doe not in this treatis discouer my ful know∣ledge for the place and altitude of this passage, yet whensoeuer it shall so please your honours to commaund, I will in few wordes make the full certainty thereof knowne vnto your honours be∣ing alwaies redie with my person and poore ha∣bilitie to prosecute this action as your honours shall direct, beseeching God so to support you with all happines of this life, fauour of her maie∣stie loue of her highnes subiectes and increase of honour as may be to your best content. I most humbly take my leaue from Sandrudg by Dartmouth this 27. of May 1595.
