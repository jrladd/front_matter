We appeal to you, the Honourable Go∣ernour and Worshipful Mayor, as to Disin∣erested Persons, and most proper Judges of he Truth and Impartiality of our Account; hich is, what was taken by the Pens of the cribes, without any material alteration. We hankfully acknowledge your Condescending

Goodness, in Honouring us with your pre∣sence and preventing disorders, during the time of disputation.
May you still continue maintainers of Ju∣stice and discipline in your respective Posts: May your Names be transmitted to Posterity, as Glorious Reformers of a corrupt and dege∣nerate Age, in conformity to the Injunctions and Example of our Gracious King: May o∣thers be excited and influenc'd by your Exam∣ple: May these hopeful beginnings be car∣ry'd on, that there may be no prophane Swearers or Debauchees in your Streets, and Vice and Wickedness may be put out of Coun∣tenance and not able to shew its Head: This is, and shall be the constant Prayer of,
