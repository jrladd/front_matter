ALthough a History,There is great differen∣cy and diuer∣sity, tending to the manner of describing Stories: First, there is Chro∣nology, Chro∣nicles, Ephe∣meride, Epi∣tomies, Rhop∣sodies, Abridg∣ment, History, and ANNALS. Chronology hath two con∣ditions, both particular and necessary: called by the Greekes, Ala∣thea, and Apa∣thia, which is the truth of things set forth without any passion. The Chro∣nicle aymes at the origi∣nall of mat∣ters, and to seeke the im∣memoriall Time, from the first anti∣quity and foundation of peoples and Nations, as Herodole for Greece, Titus Liuius for the Latine, Le¦maire in the illustrations of the Gauls, Mr. Speed for England, and others.
The Epheme∣rides describes that which hath been said or done be∣twixt two per∣sons.

 (Right Noble & Il∣lustrious) bee most dangerous, and no lesse troublesome to write, yet there is no∣thing more commodious, beneficial and

salutiferous to men, sith it is the Testi∣mony of Time, the light of Truth, and the preseruer of Life; suffering scarce no mens Names to dye, nor their re∣nownes to be buried in obliuion: for by the recordation of the deedes which they haue inacted in Times past, they are committed to future Times, eterni∣zed to the perpetuall honour of immor∣tall fame, and neuer-dying glory: Nay more, they seeme as Alexander, Scipio, Pompey, Iulius Caesar, Charles the Great, and diuers other whose memory is fresh and euer-liuing: nothing else, but the eternall monuments of Annalls deli∣uered Hercules, and freed other worthy men (who liued well and singularly profitable to their Countrey) from fa∣ding and perishing, though dead and forgotten: It was this therefore which caused Princes, and other great men to desire nothing more, then that their

worthy deedes and noble acts iudici∣ously performed in time of Peace,Rhapsodis and Epittonnes are short obserua∣tions of Hi∣story.
Annalls and History is dif∣ferent from all those, for they describe all the memora∣ble deedes and particular actions that hapned yeere∣ly, and from time to time: such as Xeno∣phon was in Greece, Sa∣lust among the Latins, Froissard in France, and Mr. William Cambden in England, and so diuers others.
The seuerall and yeerely acts must be described without any passion or affections.

 as well as generously in Warre, should be carefully written, and so propagated to all posterities by some learned Historio∣grapher: as appeareth by Alexander the Great, who when a messenger came to him, exulting with ioy, and running with a chearefull countenance fully to relate the prosperous successe of his for∣tunate affaires, made him this answere, What greater and better newes can you participate and vnfold vnto mee, vnlesse by certifying mee that Homer is liuing? Intimating thereby, that all the glory of his Heroicke actions, were like to wi∣ther and be forgotten, except some such a one as Homer was, should reuiue, to sing worthily his Encomiums, & sound his Praises and Victories with the shrill sounding Trumpet of Fame.
Neuerthelesse, confessing my selfe

vnable (though much desirous to doe you that seruice, I haue vndertooke the translation of the Heroick Annals of that euer blessed Queene Elizabeth of most happy memory, by which I aime at the preseruation of her glory, Such courte∣sie from your Honours will ingraue your worth in the Temple of Eternity, ma∣king your names thereby immortall, sith it is onely this or such like seruice, that can make you liue againe in your graue, keepe your noble fame fresh, and your happy memo∣ry from fa∣ding, sith it wil cause your ashes to bring forth Laurell, and Palme flourish and spring out of your Tombes, when the base ignorant con∣temners of learning, (which doe a∣bound in this iron age) will wither and fade: they seeme now only to liue on earth, but to warre against Vertues; much like vnto wormes in Li∣braries, to de∣stroy and de∣uour learning, which they should cherish.

 and to the perpetuall honor of your names, vnder whose honorable banner, I haue sought to shelter these my poore labours: To shew aswel the dutiful seruice of a poore Stranger to these Kingdomes in gene∣rall, as his humble and sincere affection to all your Honours in particular. The worthines of the Subiect, makes me not doubt of your noble acceptance, & in∣uites mee to bring my Oblation to the Temple of your Vertues; where, after vnfeigned Prayers for your Honours perpetuall happinesse, as well spirituall as temporall, I, with the lowest step of dutie, take my leaue; vowing euer to remaine
