SIR,
SInce it was my good fortune first by the occasion of our mutual Friend, Dr. Robert Child, (whose memory being a man most learned and ingenuous, I honour,) to kiss your Honours hand, your love to me hath ever continued so real and constant, that if I should not take such notice of it, as to my povver to acknovvledge it, I should vvorthily de∣serve the black note of infamy; but yet if I should assign this love of yours as the cause of this present Dedication, I should be very injurious both to you and to the Truths. To you, since your deser∣vings are so great, as to your ovvn personal accom∣plishments, that vvere you to me a meer stranger, yet your ovvn vvorth may above any other that I knovv in England challenge this Dedication, as one
to vvhom the God of Nature hath been so signally propitious, as to discover many of Natures most secret operations, in their causes and vvork∣ings unkovvn to many learned men. To You I therefore present these my Pyrotechnical lucubrations as a mean Painter may present a draught to the Censure of Apelles, herein acknovvledging Your Worth, and also taking off the suspition of impo∣sture from the things I vvrite, vvhich being throvvn humbly at the feet of so able a judge of their veri∣ty, desire Your acceptance onely according to their worth and reality. Take in good part then I en∣treat You these Lines, (not such as I wish them,) but such as the rudeness of my understanding could prompt me; assuring you, that though meanly a∣dorned in words, yet they contain such real expe∣riments, which will be very acceptable both to You, and to as many as have delight in the search after the mysteries of Nature, and am confident that these operations in future ages will praise their School, in which I have been a painful, though an unworthy Scholar.
As for my self I need not make any Apologie to your honour, as being known sufficiently to You: and Your Candor and Ingenuity being very ready to excus for me what failings You may discover in me, Now that to such a friend, I affect rather plainness and truth, then the garnish of words, to You, I doubt not, but it will be the rather acce∣ptable; let others judge of my rudeness as they please. I would not be so bold as to prefixe this dedication before the first part of this Treatise, which is Apologetical, and somewhat tart, against the abuses of the Galenists, because I would not ingage your honour with me in any quarrel, that
part therefore I leave to it self to sink or swim ac∣cording to the weight or lightness of its Reasons and Arguments; the Moving Cause to which smartness, was the uncivility of the Galenical party, in reproching and reviling this noble Art in gene∣ral, and Helmont in particular (to both Your ho∣nour and My self a deserved favourite,) whom I formerly made My Chimical Evangelist, but do now believe, not convinced by his Arguments and Rea∣sons, but by experimental Confirmation, and practical ocular demonstration.
My self indeed, have from the common Ene∣mie of the worthie Art and Artists of Chymistry and Pyrotechny. received many uncivil abuses upon that very score; on which grounds I may be thought to have written so sharply in revenge: but although it is very true that Parit indignatio versum, yet I can truly affirm, that it was not upon the score of private grudge that I was invited to take up the buckler, but because I saw truth it self affronted, and contemned in the persons of its most deserving Champions, such as were Helmont and Paracelsus; Now fearing lest if such reproches should passe without Animadversion, the Common people who cannot read either Helmont or Paracelsus; the exo∣tickness of the language in which they wrote keep∣ing them lockt from most of our English Nation, yet whose lives are neerly concerned in what they treat of, for this Cause I put pen to paper, who otherwise had rather chosen to lie hid, and did un∣dertake the Apologie of those, whose books other∣wise I confess my self unworthy to commend. Yet if God, who is only wise, have chosen the mean and foolish things of the world to confound the loftie and wise, I hope no man of understanding will
contend with him, nor will any of discretion under∣value a treasure, because in a poor earthen pot hid∣den: These things I write not to Your honour, as fearing or suspecting Yourself inclinable to such a spirit of prejudice, but as sensible of mine own undeservingness, I cannot but excuse it to o∣thers, who perhaps know me little or not at all, be∣ing before hand satisfied, that Your honour would be more willing to cover my imperfections, then I (without impudence) could desire, or with reason expect. And not to detain You longer in the en∣trance, be pleased to view the House it self; to every Room whereof I shall account it my Happi∣ness to be your Guide, who before, and in all other things am, and must subscribe my self;
Sir,
