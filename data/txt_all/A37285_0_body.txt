Worthy Sir,
I May be thought bold, if not impu∣dent,
(upon so little acquaintance)
to make this sawcy trespasse upon
your patience; But fame, whose of∣fice,
(like the Nomenclators at Rome) is to
to take notice and proclaime the Name and
vertues of every Noble Personage, has given
you out for so Ingenuous a professor of the
Arts, & so bountiful a patron of poor schollars
it has imboldned me, to present my Hive of
Bees to your favourable protection; and when
I remember how Lewis the eleventh (of that
Name) King of France tooke notice, & boun∣tifully
rewarded a decay'd Gardiner, who pre∣sēted
him with a bunch of Carrets, I doubt not
of their kinde and generous entertainment;
upon which assurance I rest ever.
