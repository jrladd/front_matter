HAuing a long time consi∣dred
the contentious dif∣ference,
betweene the
true eternal light, and the
foule horrid darknesse of
Beliall:Psal. 19. by grace and assi∣stance
of him,Math. 25. that giueth
wisedome to the simplest,
I boldly vndertooke sum∣marily
to gather, a Chri∣stian
warlike encounter,
with the proud Romane Praelate, that so audaciously lifts
vp himselfe against Iesus Christ. Which when I had ac∣complished,
after I had imparted the same, to diuers of
good knowledge and learning, to whom I am vnworthy
to be tearmed a Scholler: their aduise ouer-ruled me, not
to hide or burie this poore tallent in the earth. Vpon fur∣ther
consideration, to decorate and adorne the labour,
with some honorable title and fauour: I dedicated and
presented it to three most illustrious Personages, very
great and excellent vessels of honour, and endeared ser∣uants
to our Lord Iesus. Now, because I am not ignorant,
that you are to them all a most auncient, loyall & firme
friend: my humble supplication to you, is, to receiue like∣wise

this poore penny into your protection, to note with
what coyne it is stamped on both sides, and to try which
of them is false or counterfeit, and whether of them is
pure mettall,1. Thes. 6. and acceptable in the sight of God. On
whose part I pray you may long continue as his Champi∣on,Matth. 24.
and I to remaine in your fauour and good regard:Ephe. 6.
according as the Apostle requireth in good seruants
toward their masters.Tit. 1. From Egypt, neere
to the red Sea,Apoc. 13. expecting the yeere
666. against Babylon.
