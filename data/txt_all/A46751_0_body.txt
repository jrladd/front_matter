Right Honourable,
AS your Lordship is known to have been a Signal Instrument for the Re-Establishing his Majestie on the Throne of his Kingdoms, so your Zeal for the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, and of His Majestie's Person and Govern∣ment, thus restored (in great part) by the Wisdom and Activity of your Honour's Counsel, may Justifie my Election, in Entitling your Lordship (before any other) to the Patronage of this Small Tract; Little indeed for Bulk, but, if I mistake not, considerable in its Ʋse, in regard it strengthens the former Disco∣veries of Others, at such a Juncture of time, when some foyl and damp was endeavoured to be cast upon Them by the subtle Contrivances of the adverse Party. I have observed all along in the Progress of this matter, That when the Evidence for the King hath seemed to be at a Bay, as discouraged by the Power or Policy of Malevolent Persons, Then, by Divine Providence, another Witness hath started up to retreive and confirm, what before seemed to be at a Loss: Thus after the aspersions and prejudices cast on Mr. Oates, Mr. Bedlowe, and Mr. Dug∣dale came in to assert and carry on the Truth of his Testimony (endeavoured to be shaken) by the addi∣tion of their own: And when the matter seemed not fully to bear and to be made out, as to the Murther of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, then God raised up
Mr. Praunce to make a plain Discovery of that Horrrid and Bloody Fact. Moreover, when at, and since the Tryal of Sir George Wakeman and the Rest (wherein I also appeared) some Discourage∣ments, not yet fully enquired into, were cast upon the Witnesses for his Majestie, yet I was so far from being deterred by that (otherwise) disheartning Cir∣cumstance, that I am rather animated thereby to pro∣secute my Evidence with greater Vigour, as concei∣ving it a Crisis, wherein Truth stands in need thereof; Neither do I doubt, but Others also may succeed me, with their seasonable Reliefs of this Kind, in case Falshood should make any further Attempt to over-ballance and weigh down the Truth; Which hope of Mine is in part verified already, by the ad∣ditional Testimony of Mr. Smith, hereafter mentioned; And I am persuaded, that both His and Mine, will receive future Confirmation by the Astipulations of Others (at present not publickly known) if need shall require; That so it may be said of our Opposers, Though they will not see, yet they shall see, and be ashamed. I know your Lordship will allow me to use that Scriptural Expression, because the band of God (to those who seriously consider it) is more than ordinarily seen in these matters. That none of these Providences of the Almighty, may be Lost upon this Nation, but be mutually Improved, both by Prince and People, to an Humble Acknowledgment, and a Thankful Obedience, is the Prayer of
My Lord,
