Right Worshipfull Sir,
BOokes without Patrons, are like Babes without Parents, (for except the one be pleasing and plausible to humour, the va∣rious dispositions of men, and the other left with warme portions or legacies in the tuition of faithfull Executors or Guardians) both Bookes and Babes are happy if they die in their birth, that the first minute of their miserie may be the first moment of their felicities: these considerations haue humbly emboldened me to lay this poore Infant of my laborious Braine, at the doore or gate of your patro∣nage & protection, not doubting but your innated chari∣ty, good disposition, and vnfaigned affectation of al Law∣dable endeuours, will giue it both free and hospitable
entertainment. The function I treate of being venerable and honourable, as of Shepheards, the profit commenda∣ble, lawfull, necessarie, ample, and vniuersall, as of Sheepe. The writing or method of it historicall, mysticall, tropi∣call, typicall, literall, and Satyricall; which hath encou∣raged me to dedicate my poore Shepheardly inuention, and their harmlesse flockes to your Worships good ac∣ceptance, whose reuerend function is truly Pastorall; ac∣knowledging that my many imperfections in writing, and vnworthinesse in handling so worthy a subiect, hath made me doubtfull to vse the protection of your Name; yet on the other side, considering your good inclination, and mine owne humble innocencie, both my selfe and my best endeauours I here consecrate to be employed euer in your Worships seruice.
