WOrld, I do not call thee good or bad; thou art a mixture of both as I my self, and all men else, that live in thee: I here present thee with a Miscellaneous Collection of mine own Thoughts and Observations of dvers years. They are too various for me, to bring into method; as they came into my minde, I set them down, that they might not be buried in mine own Bo∣som; thou hast them delivered in the same order. I commit them to thee, but not commend them. I am neither so self-confident, as to think, that none of them can be dsliked of, nor yet so self-dubious, but that I believe, that
 some of them possibly may be allowed ▪ I put them forth, not to please, nor to displease; onely to declare mine own opinion. Such as they are, in thee, the World, I did conceive them; such as they are, to thee, the World, I therefore leave them.


Rich Grounds brings forth rich Fruits, and taller Trees:
Mine but poor Grass, and such low shrubs, as these.
