Sir,
I Have been earnestly entreated, to importune you to the printing of those Sermons, which in your prea∣ching of them, were so greatly appro∣ved of, and so signally successefull. The Text was, Ezra. 10.2. You have since your coming amongst us, prea∣ched upon severall necessary and sea∣sonable Subjects amongst them, though many of the others might have cost you as much paines, and have been very profitable and usefull, yet these by some of your best and most judicious Auditors, are desired to be the first fruits to a future harvest: I should not ingage you to this work
(knowing the burthens that lye upon you, not only in your publick ministry, which is very great, but the multitude of private concernments, wherein you are pressed above strength, & if not wisely moderated will shorten your daies) but that my own judg∣ment concurs with others for the pub∣lishing of them;Prov 13.1. Hope deferred ma∣keth the heart sick. Alexander the great he had all; when he had nothing, because he had Hope. The Poets feign that in Pandora's box, which was stuffed with all the woes and miseries that might be, the Gods placed Hope in the bottome, the Prophet calls the people of God Prisoners of Hope.zach. 9.12 It was this that made the Rebell come in, when a thousand pound was pro∣claim'd to be given to whomesoever could bring his Head: the Hue and
crie will make the Traitor run, when Hopes of pardon will bring him back. I shall adde no more but that my Hopes are, you will answer our Hopes, and my pray∣ers shall be for Gods blessing on them.
