Sir,
I Haue read (said Cosmus a
Duke of Florence) that wee
should forgiue our Enemies,
but no where that wee should
forgiue our Friends: It
seemes by this Dukes doctrine, that the
transgression of an engaged obseruer is no
veniall sinne. Indeede the discontinuance
of my seruice cries so loude, that had I not
much faith in your goodnesse, I should
not hope an attonement; But your noble
nature hath bespoke my confidence. The

figure of that deuotion long since set in my
brest I heere delineate in this Dedication,
begging the noble charity of your con∣struction,
that you would rather conceiue
well of the patterne, then too nearely ex∣amine
the portraiture. A diffidence wher∣of
were an vnpardonable trespasse to your
generous selfe, to whom my study shall
make good, what your merits expect from
the faith of his obseruance, in whose
Logicke to bee and to bee
yours is conuertible.
