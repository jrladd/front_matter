RIGHT HONORABLE,
I Haue vndertaken a great taske, to teach men how to bee happy in this life: J haue vndertaken and performed it: wherein J haue followed Seneca, and gone beyond him; followed him as a Philo∣sopher, gone beyond him as a Christian, as a Di∣uine. Finding it a true censure of the best Moralists, that they were like to goodly Ships, graced with great titles, the Sauegard, the Triumph, the Good-speed, and such like, when yet they haue beene both extremely Sea-beaten, and at last wracked. The volume is little, perhaps the vse more; J haue euer thought accor∣ding to the Greeke Prouerbe, . What it is, euen iustice challengeth it to him, to whom the Author hath deuoted himselfe: The children of the bondman are the goods of the pa∣rents Master. J humbly betake it to your Honours protection, and your Honour to the protection of the Highest.
