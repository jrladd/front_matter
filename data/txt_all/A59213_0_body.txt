Most Honoured Sir,
I Have profan'd your name so far, as to prefix it to this trifle, not because I think it worthy of your sight or acceptance, but because it may be subservient to my design; and my design in this Paper is to give some check to the Luxury of this Age, and to retrieve the Antient Discipline of the Church concerning Maceration of the Body, and to effect that, to recommend the exam∣ple of great St. Paul the Apostle, and other Apostolick men who were followers of St. Paul, even as he was of Christ. It was a celebrious Sermon of Seneca, though a Heathen man, non ideo natus sum ut mancipium fiam corporis, I was not therefore born that I might become a slave of the Body; which you have somwhere illustrated by a Divine Poem, but made more illustrious by your Divine Life; for though you and your Ancestors have been renown'd for your Hospitality and Noble House-keeping, yet I dare avouch it, there is no Asce∣tick living uses more moderation and abstinence, in eating and drinking than your self. The Ascetick is in a man∣ner
forc'd to it by the Rules of his Order, but you do it out of pure choice. What Minucius Foelix saith of the first Christians, they did vivere grandia, live great things; I may say of you; you do vivere grandia, you live above the rate of the vulgar, you live above the rate of persons of your own Rank and Quality; you live above the rate of us Ecclesiasticks. There is no Ecclesi∣astick of us all spends more time in Holy Reading, and takes more pains in searching into the deep things of Theo∣logy than your self. There are more great things of your life I could mention, as your great Loyalty to your Prince, your immense Charity to all Dissenters from you, your profound humility; but I am afraid I shall trespass up∣on your Modesty, as St. Ignatius the holy Martyr in one of his genuine Epistles says, , they which commend me scourge me. I shall add no more but only this petition, which is, that you would par∣don my presumption in using your name, and give me leave to subscribe my self what I really am,
Most Honoured Sir,
