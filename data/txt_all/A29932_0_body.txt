Right Honourable, and my good Lord and Lady.
MAny and great are the obli∣gations that lye upon me to your Honours, as upon many other, so upon the account of my yongest Son Noah, many Years since Mini∣ster in Stafford; since, for the space of more than Seven Years your

Chaplain; whom, while he lived in your Noble and Religious Family, you loved dearly and prized highly, and whose Death you take heavily. So that all that my self and my two surviving Sons can do in way of thankfulness, should we live Methusalem's Days, will come short of what You have deserved of us. And therefore we must and shall make it our Daily Prayer, while we are in the Land of the living, to Him who is All-sufficient, to give to your Honours a full reward. Mean time these poor low Medita∣tions of mine upon the richest and highest subject I most humbly pre∣sent to your Honours, as a token of my gratitude, beseeching your ac∣ceptance of it, (as that great Prince did of the poor Man's handful of Water, who had no better thing at hand to offer) beseeching God to bless it to You, and to all into whose Hands it shall come for the furtherance of your and their spi∣ritual and eternal good; and that

he will grant you according to the Riches of his Glory, that as you have been, and still are very great Props and Encouragements to the profession and practice of Piety, Loyalty, and Charity in that King∣dom where you now live, and were so in this, while you lived here, so you may live long and long to pro∣mote both in both, till you be tran∣slated into his everlasting rest.
