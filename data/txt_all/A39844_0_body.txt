Sir,
YOUR great Skill and Judgment in the Practice of Physick, is so well known to all Your Coun∣trey, as well as to many of the Learned'st of Our Faculty, that I can need no

Apology for the Dedica∣tion of a Physical Treatise to You.
If I Reflect on those Favours I have received from Your Honoured Family, they may justly claim this Expression of my Gratitude for Them: But I think my self most particularly Obliged to make this Publick Ac∣knowledgement of those great Advantages I have had by Your Learned Conversation.
Your Chymical Experi∣ments have given me clear

Notions of the Principles of many particular Bodies, and their Sensible Qualities, by Anatomical Dissections. You have procured for me some Animal Humours to Taste and Examine; and by Your Microscopes, I have observed more of the Con∣sistence of Fluids than I could otherways have known.
These Notions which I here present You, were the Subject of our fre∣quent Conferences; and I never liked any of them so well as those Your Judg∣ment approved of.

When Your Kindness to Your Neighbours, or Cha∣rity to the Poor, Obliged You to prescribe Physick, (which frequently You do) I have observed, when I was called to any Consultation with You, Your exact Judgment in distinguishing the nicest Cases, Your Rational Pre∣scriptions, grounded on the true Indications, taken from the History of the particular Case, and di∣rected against the Cause of the Disease; and also, Your great Value for

Simple Medicines, prescribed in their due Quantity; and I can most truly affirm, That a great Success al∣ways attended this ratio∣nal Practice.
Sir, Your exact Judg∣ment in Physick deserves the highest Expressions of Esteem from the most In∣genious Writers in our Art; but I must depend on that great Candor and Civility You constantly express to Our whole Faculty, for Your Ac∣cepting of the Patronage of these Papers which are

Presented by Him who has a real Value both for Your Vertue and Learning; and who am,
SIR,

Lichfield, July 26 1695.
