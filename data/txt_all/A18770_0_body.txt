BY the Authors im∣mutable decree, being his last, this booke was desti∣nate to you, and vpō your allowance, to passe for authorised. What he willed, I haue performed. Agreeing in this with the Authors opinion, That the clerest sighted can best iudge of colours. What your experiēce is in this diuine hearbe, al men do

know; and acknowledge you to bee The Souereigne of Tabacco, and for such they do honor you. If I doe not otherwise vse those tearms of skill, & phrases in your commendation, which are com∣monly accustomed to bee set foorth, to the worthie patrons of mens works, which the Author no doubt would haue done if he had liued: it is for want of know∣ledge both of art to do it, and of your perfections, which doe me∣rit more than I can giue sufficient testimonie of; only by the report that runneth of your fame, I doe auouch in one word that you are Most-worthie. And for such I do recommend this rare worke of a

most pretious hearbe vnto you. What may either be said for it, or surmised against it, you know right well; and therefore I doe leaue all men to receaue your in∣struction, and you to Gods mercifull prote∣ction.
