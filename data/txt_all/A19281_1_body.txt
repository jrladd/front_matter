RIGHT HONOVRABLE: seeing the Lord hath ioyned you both in the benefit of this great deliuerance: therefore haue I beene emboldened to ioyne your Honours also in this remembrance thereof. Though I doe not say with the Iewes, concerning the Centurion, that you are worthy of this blessing: yet I may safely say what Peter did of the other Centurion: that herein hath the Lord remembred your loue vnto the Gospell, and care vnto his Saints. My hearts desire is, that this deliue∣rance may encrease these blessings vnto you, that so you may grow vp from grace to grace, 'till you attaine vnto the full measure of the age of Iesus Christ: to whose bles∣sed protection I commend your Honours, and your Princely Charge. And so I humblie take my leaue.
