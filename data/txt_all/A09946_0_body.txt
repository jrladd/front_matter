HAVING CON∣sidered, and called to memorie (most gra∣cious Soueraigne) the manifolde blessings and bene∣fites, giuen by the incomparable mercie of God to vs your sub∣iects, by your ministerie, and the execution of your Kingly office, and vnder your Maiesties pro∣tection, and most peaceable go∣uernement:
 wherein we doe not onely enioye, and quietly possesse the fruite of our labours, and all other our temporal commodities, but (that which is many thousād times more worth) euen the li∣bertie of conscience, the prea∣ching and hearing of Gods most sacred trueth, the fruition and vse of the most holy Sacraments of our Lord Iesus Christ, which are seales vnto vs of the assu∣rance of our inheritance in the kingdome of GOD. And on the otherside, hauing throughly weighed our contempt and in∣gratitude to Almightie God, to his sonne Iesus Christ, and to
 your Maiestie: by whom, as the onely meane from God, we reape all these good things, and are de∣fended and mainteined in this our happie state: I cannot inough wonder, nor sufficiently lament, to see for the most part how litle we regarde, and how seldome we come to the hearing of Gods most holy worde, and to the cele∣bration of these his most holy mysteries: and when we do come, howe rudely, vnaduisedly, and vnreuerently it is, cannot be but most feareful, and most pitifull to beholde. Wherefore most graci∣ous Queene, and dread Soue∣raigne, the zeale and duetie I
 owe to the glory of GOD, and to the honour of your Maiestie, (who cannot, but be greatly dis∣honoured in this our negligence) hath enforced me to procure the ayde of an excellent learned and godly man, to compile three short instructions, or admonitions vp∣on the three first titles, or con∣tents in the seconde page of this litle manuel (whereunto are ad∣ded certaine most needefull prai∣ers and thankesgiuing, all which may properly be entituled, A pre∣paration to the holy Commu∣nion of the body and blood of our Lorde) to the ende wee may be moued with better considera∣tion
 of the benefits we receiue in these sacred mysteries, and also with the greatnesse of the danger for the abuse and contempt of the same: Most humbly besee∣ching your Maiestie, according to your accustomed goodnesse, to accepte in good parte this my simple and vnskilfull seruice, that by your good acceptation hereof, many of your Maiesties most honorable housholde, and others also, may be drawen and procured to the exercise of the same, to their further instructi∣on, comfort, and consolation, by the working of Gods holy Spirit: to whom with the Father & the
 Sonne, be all glory for euer, and to your Maiestie, a most honora∣ble, long and prosperous raigne ouer vs, with all other his merci∣full blessings in this life, and in the life to come, ioy, felicitie, and continuall dwelling with all the blessed Angels and Saints in the kingdome of God, world without ende, AMEN.
