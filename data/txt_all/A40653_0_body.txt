Madam,
BY the Judicial Law of the Jewes, if a servant hadExod. 21. 4. children by a wife which was given him by his Master, though he him∣selfe

went forth free in the seventh yeere, yet his children did remain with his Master, as the proper goods of his possession. I ever have been, and shall be a servant to that no∣ble Family, whence your Honour is extracted. And of late in that house I have been wedded to the pleasant embraces of a private life, the fittest wife, and meetest Hel∣per that can be provided for a Student in trouble∣some

times: And the same hath been bestowed upon me by the bounty of your Noble Brother, EDW: Lord MONTAGUE: Wherefore what issue so∣ever shall result from my mind, by his meanes most happily marryed to a re∣tired life, must of due re∣dound to his Honour, as the sole Proprietarie of my paines during my present condition. Now this Booke is my eldest Off-spring, which had it





beene a Sonne, (I mean, had it been a Worke of Masculine beauty and bignesse) it should have waited as a Page in De∣dication to his Honour. But finding it to be of the weaker sexe, little in strength, and low in sta∣ture, may it be admitted (Madam) to attend on your Ladiship, his Ho∣nours Sister.
I need not mind your Ladiship how God hath measured outward hap∣pinesse

unto you by the Cubit of the Sanctua∣rie, of the largest size, so that one would be posed to wish more then what your Ladiship doth en∣joy. My prayer to God shall be, that shining as a Pearle of Grace here, you may shine as a Starre in Glory hereafter. So resteth
 Boughton, Ian. 25. 1646.
