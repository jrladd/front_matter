SIR,
THe various fortune generally be∣falling Papers that have taken
 leave of their Authors, hath brought one of yours into my hands, (which I found
 to be a designe might (if once known) happily prove of singular benefit and
 advantage to our King and all his People, by proposing one self same way,
 and that easie, and certain for the gene∣rall happiness of both: though our
 modern Politicians (who have not yet the milk of their beloved Nurce Rebellion
 squeesed out of their Noses) with unparalleld arrogance 
 endeavour to make the world believe
 the wel∣fare of our King and his Subjects altogether incompatible) I could no
 more avoyd pub∣lishing this excellent Subject, than I now know how to
 excuse my self for doing it: but like a Girle that marries without her
 Friends consent (which she was sure never to obtain) I thought 'twas
 less sinne to do it without your knowledge, than against your will, and
 so more pardonable in

Sir
