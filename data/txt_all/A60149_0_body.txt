Sir,
IF the following Sermon upon the Death of your Brother, may be of any Ʋse and Advantage unto others, the Obligation will be very much owing to you, with whose Desire I complied in the Preaching of it, and now in the making of it Publick: The chief of my Design therein being the Instruction of the Younger sort, I could not so fitly prefix any other Name as yours. I hope your tender Affection to your Brother will make you read this Memorial of of him with great Seriousness; and assist your good Improvement of those Coun∣sels, which are so needful for Persons of your Age to consider, and obey.

I shall only add my Hearty Prayer to God for the Early Impressions of his Grace, to Sanctifie you betimes, and make you to know and love the Holy Scriptures, and so preserve you from the Snares of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and particularly from Youthful Lusts.
If this Sermon may any way con∣tribute to such a desirable effect on you, and others of your Age, I shall bless God.
London,
Feb. 25. 1691/2.
