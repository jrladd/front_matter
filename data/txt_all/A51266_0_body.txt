SIR,
YOur request is a command. I have transcribed these notes, and as near as I could to a very syllable as they
were delivered in the Pul∣pit. Not that I judge them worthy your further view, but because I judge you wor∣thy to command any thing which is called mine. And it is an honour to me that you do accept of this poor mite. If in the least a furtherance to the joy of Faith, it will more then recompense. That you take heed to the better part, searching the Scri∣ptures whether these things be so, bespeaks you a Be∣rean,
and of more noble spi∣rit. But second thoughts I presume will correct your motion for the Presse. We live in a bold age indeed, Scribimus indocti docti{que}: And Jeremie's Figs have their applause, both those that are extremely good, and those that are extremely bad: but this you'l finde in neither basket. The Subject I confesse is worthy to be seen abroad; and now per∣haps more necessary, then
at other times. We see how the Jesuit hath exchang'd his poyson: and the genera∣tion of vipers multiply. Oh how they rend the bowels of their Mother! And the Church of England, once the most glorious Church in the Christian world, now fled into the Wildernesse. Yet Eliah hath some Thou∣sands, and a John in Pat∣mos, companions in tribu∣lation, and in the King∣dome, and patience of Jesus
Christ. The Lord put it in∣to the hands and hearts of our Nehemiahs to reedifie Jerusalem. The chief stone in the foundation is here laid. But I could wish a Be∣zaleel in the work, a more skilful builder, Mihi cur∣ta supellex. It holds good with me in more senses then in one. Besides, you know my constant task; and it fals out with me, as with the man that hath many chil∣dren, the younger still robs
the elder: nor have I done the double service of one day, but another is stil calling on me. Both shoulders have their burden. Yet such as it is, both my self and it lie prostrate at your Honours feet. I am
Sir,
