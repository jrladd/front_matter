THE new Ʋse I have disco∣vered of the Bark, to cure infallibly all sorts of Fevers, with∣out taking any thing by
the Mouth, has been ap∣proved of by your Ma∣jesty, with a Goodness so obliging, when I had the Honour to present it, that I should have all the reason in the world to believe, the Publick would give it a no less favour∣able Reception, if I offer it my self. But, Sir, after what man∣ner will it not be re∣ceived by all your Sub∣jects,
when they know 'tis Your Majesty, that has been graciously pleas∣ed to impart this Disco∣very, thro the Paternal Care which Your Royal Goodness is pleased to take of their Health? Yes, Sir, 'tis this ex∣treme Goodness, that after having made Your Majesty condescend to enquire into the particu∣lar Wants of the Sick,
which are some of those that have the Happi∣ness to serve in Your Houshold, and: which Your Majesty has done me the Honour to recom∣mend to my Care, oblig'd Your Majesty thereupon to command me to pub∣lish my Remedy; to the intent, that no person in Your Kingdom might be deprived of the Advan∣tage of making use of it.
I obey, Sir, not only with the most humble Respect, and the most profound Submission, which I owe to the Commands of my King, but also with a particular. Satisfaction and Joy, that I have been able to enrich, and bring the Art of Physick to perfection for the good of France, which your Heroick Vertues have
advanced so far above the rest of the Nations of the World; and which is my true Country, since it has pleased Your Ma∣jesty in Naturalizing me, to honour me with the quality of one of Your Majesties Subjects. But at the same time, Sir, I take the Liberty which Your Majesty has given me, to put under the Pro∣tection
of Your August Name, this which I have published to the World; it being Justice, that after the singular Grace Your Majesty did me, (when I had the Honor to present my Specifick against the Dysenter) in granting me the pow∣er to have Laboratories throughout the whole Kingdom all the Fruits
of my future Labours should be devoted, as of Right belonging to Your Majesty, and should serve me as a means to testify a lively and hear∣ty Acknowledgment of Your Majestys Favours, and my ardent Zeal to sacrifice to Your Service during my whole Life, with an entire Devotion, all that my mean Ca∣pacity
and weak Endea∣vours are capable of.
