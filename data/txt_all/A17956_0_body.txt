WHen cheerfull Phoebus his full course hath run,
His sisters fainter beams our harts doth cheere:
So your faire Brother is to mee the Sunne,
And you his Sister as my Moone appeere.


You are my next belou'd, my second Friend,
For when my Phoebus absence makes it Night,
Whilst to th'Antipodes his beames do bend,
From you my Phoebe, shines my second Light.


Hee like to SOL, cleare-sighted, constant, free,
You LVNA-like, vnspotted, chast, diuine:
Hee shone on Sicily, you destin'd bee,
T'illumine the now obscurde Palestine.
My first was consecrated to Apollo,
My second to DIANA now shall follow.
