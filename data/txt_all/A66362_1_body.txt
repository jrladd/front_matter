Elect Lady,
YOur dayly Orator, that formerly hath written Books and Epistles to mighty Kings and most ho∣nourable
 Princes, doth now beg leave to dedicate these en∣suing Sermons unto your Gra∣ces view. I know many Scho∣lers expecting their preferment, will not be wanting to express the noble Acts, unparaleld Fi∣delity, and most justly deserved Honours and Praises of the thrice honourable your dear Hus∣band, the Duke of Ormond's Grace; but my age bids me ex∣pect my dissolution, and not worldly promotion: and there∣fore onely challengeth that pre∣sumption
 to dedicate these few Sermons unto your Graces view, not as some others use to do, to beg for any patronage or de∣fence, for any thing that I have said therein; (for what is good will justifie it self, and what is amiss, let it be justly blamed, I will never protect it) but to shew unto the world how high∣ly I do honour your Grace, and would needs finde out, by what wayes I should propa∣gate and perpetuate your Graces Worth, Piety, and Vertue to
 the indelible view and remem∣brance of all your Off-spring, for their glory and the glory of all their Posterities, for their exam∣ple throughout all the remain∣der of these last Ages of the World: for I believe that I may truly say it, without errour, that neither Gorgonia, nor Trasilla, nor any other of those glorious Stars, that in their times shined in the Firmament of the Church, and which are registred to Posterities for their everlasting praise by Saint
 Nazianzen, Saint Jerome, and other Fathers of the Church were comparably so blessed in the choicest of the blessings of this life,Id est, in their Hus∣bands and Children. nor were they so pa∣tient in their afflictions, so pi∣ous in their conversation, so humble and so meeke in their demeanour towards the worthi∣est of Gods Ministers, as your Grace hath alwayes shewed your self to be unto all even the meanest of Gods servants, and espe∣cially to me, when in a very mean condition, I came to wait
 upon your Grace in Donmore, before the King came into the Kingdome; and I must passe o∣ver your wise, discreet, and most prudent carriage of great affairs, and in such des∣perate times, to the benefit and preservation of many good men and faithful Subjects to his Majesty, in the midst of a fro∣ward, subtle, and perverse Ge∣neration, without which they had been utterly destroyed: And I pass over these things and ma∣ny other most eminent vertues
 and endowments of your Lady∣ship; because I am not suffici∣ently able to characterize and de∣lineate the same, so sweetly and so commendably as your Grace hath shewed, to the full measure of your deservings: but though mine ability reacheth not to express your worth, yet this my devotion shall ne∣ver be wanting to shew my de∣sires with the best of my pray∣ers, and all the faculties of my soul, to be your Orator unto God, and to make your name and
 memorial in the World, like the remembrance of Josias, fair as the Lilly, and sweet as the pretious oyntment that is made by the art of the Apothe∣cary: So I rest,
Most honourable Lady
