SIR, I pray you consider with mee an especial point of Gods word carefullie to be waied: it is this.Mat. 25. 1 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. Luk. 13. 24. A caueat to all Pro∣testants of what e∣state or cō∣dition so∣euer. Manie professors of Christ, in the day of grace, perswade them selues that they are in the estate of grace; and

so the true Church esteemeth of thē too: yet when the day of grace is past, they contrariwise shall find themselues to bee in the estate of damnation remedilesse. A dolefull case, yet a most resolute trueth, and the reason is playne. Men that liue in the Church are greatly annoyed with a fearefull securitie and deadnes of hart, by which it comes to passe that they thinke it inough to make a common pro∣testatiō of the faith; not once in al their life times, examining themselues whe∣ther they be in the estate of grace before the eternall God or not. 2. Cor. 13. 5. Psa. 119. 59 And indeed it is a grace peculiar to the man Electe to trie himselfe whether he be in the estate of grace or not.
The further opening of the trueth of this point as also the danger of it, I haue enterprised in this treatise: which I am willing to bestowe on you; both for the

profession of the faith, which you make as also for that Christian friendship, you haue shewed to me. Accept of it I pray you & vse it for your edification. Act. 20. 32. Thus I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, that is able to build you vp further and giue you an inheritance a∣mong them which are sanctified. From Cambridge this 24. of No∣uember. 1589.
