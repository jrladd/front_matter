My Lord,
YOUR Lordship's favourable ac∣ceptance of my Discourse of the Sacraments in General, with the desire I have, if it may be, to put an end to the whole, hath prompted me to make the more hast to pre∣sent your Lordship, and the World with this of Baptism in particular.
Two things there are in it, which I thought my self most concern'd to clear, and which therefore I have employ'd all requisite diligence on, the Doctrine of Original Sin, and Infant-Baptism:
The former being in my opinion the foundation of Christianity, the latter of our interest in it. For if there be no such thing as Original Sin, I do not see but some per∣sons heretofore might, and may here after live with such exactness, as not at all to stand in need of a Saviour. And I see as little, if In∣fant-Baptism be null, what interest any of us can have in him, according to the ordinary dispensation of the Gospel, who have for the most part been baptized in our Infancy, or at least have been baptized by those that were.
Throughout the whole Treatise I have en∣deavour'd to retrive the antient notion of Bap∣tism, to shew what advantages are annexed to it; and what duties it either involves, or obligeth to. To either of which if I have given any light, or strength, I shall hope I have done some small service to the Church, and which your Lordship in particular will take in good part from

Wellwyne, Aug. 23. 1686.
