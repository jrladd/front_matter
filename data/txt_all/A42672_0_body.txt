DAyly experience proves that of Seneca too true: None is so happy in gi∣ving, but that sometimes hee is deceived, For the greatest part of men are thus affected, saith the Comick, humble they are, and promise much whilst they are suitors for favours, but assoon as they have obtained them, of all men they are the worst and most deceitfull: men even make hast to forget good turn's, as God himself com∣plaines by the Psalmist of his Israel; a vice of vices, Ingratum si dixeris, Omnia dixeris: Non digni dandis, quia ingrati datis; unworthy of any fa∣vour,
because unthankfull for the least. Invitat ad magna qui gratanter acci∣pit modica, & spem de futuris recipit, qui transacta beneficia recognoscit. Many are the favours I have received of your hands, Honourable & Worship∣full of which I may truly say as Seneca of Furmius to Augustus;Lib. 22. de benif. c. 25. Hanc unam Caesar habeo injuriam tuam, effecisti ut viverem & morerer ingratus. I well hoped before this time to have freed my self in some sort by a small testimony of my thankfull heart, but the multitude of impediments and second thoughts made mee to lay it aside for a while. And now at length I humbly present this as a meā & innocent monument of my grati∣tude. In magnis voluisse sat est. It may proclaim and publish my obligation to you. And assure your selves that besides these few lines to the common and vul∣gar people, I shall alwayes contend and strive by my dayly prayers to my good God for you, to bee privately thankfull: I humbly take my leave, and unfained∣ly remain.
