MADAM,
IT was a considera∣ble Time before I could resolve up∣on a Dedication; but,
 knowing that few Books, (and especially Novels,) are wanting in this Point, I then presently fix'd my Resolution; trod in the steps of those that went before; and submitted to the Ty∣rant Custom. I was not long in resolving to whom I ought to dedicate it: Your Honour became in∣stantly the Object of a Thought lofty, and
 aspiring, which hur∣ried me to this Bold∣ness. Yes, Madam, you will think it is a new way of being grateful for past Fa∣vours, to ask new ones: And yet this very Absurdity do I now commit; but I am sensible of your generous Temper, and relying upon that alone, I beg this one Favour more, your Patronage, and
 Acceptance of this Virgin Essay, the Pro∣duct of my leisure Hours.
This piece in all its Designs, aims at what is great and generous, and is founded partly upon Truth; many of the material Cir∣cumstances having been really acted at Genoa but few years a∣go: It insists chiefly upon two Subjects;
 the effects of an un∣parallel'd Friendship; and the Force, and Reward of Constant Love. It appear'd first of all in French; and tho now naturaliz'd into our good-na∣tur'd Climat, and be∣come English, yet it has lost nothing of its French Vanity, and Presumption, but da∣ringly hopes to crow'd into your Ho∣nour's Closet, there
 expecting the hap∣py Time when, Ma∣dam, you will be pleas'd to throw a∣way some spare mo∣ments.
Those Readers who have not yet been bless'd with your Ho∣nour's Acquaintance, may perhaps say, This is not like a Dedicati∣on, and their Reason for it will be, because it is not stuff'd with ful∣some
 Flattery, and because I have not describ'd to 'em either your Person, or Ver∣tues; but I must tell them (whosoever they may be) that I am a very ill Encomiast, and a worse Flatterer: However, rather than Men should go away discontented, if in few words a plain un∣deniable Truth will satisfy 'em, they shall have it; that your
 Birth, Nature, and E∣ducation have con∣spir'd together to make you every way truly agreeable, which, tho it has procur'd you the strongest Envy of our Sex, it has attract∣ed no less the high∣est Admiration of theirs.
One Favour more I importunely crave, that for some Rea∣sons
 (which by you, Madam, shall be com∣manded from me at any time,) I may be permitted to refrain the publishing my Name in Print; tho really nothing is so sensible a Grief to me, as that I am forc'd to stifle my greatest Ambition, which is, to declare to the World, the Name of her, who, among all the Crowd of
 your Admirers, is the most zealously,
Madam,
