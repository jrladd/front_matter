IT is not my fortune to be so infortunately read, as to begin (after the common stampe of dedication) with a grai-headed Apophthegme, or some straied sentence out of Tully, but in such proper and plaine language, as a most humble and affectionate due∣tie can speake, I do heere offer vp on the altar of my hart, the first fruits of my long-growing ende∣uors; which (with much constancie and confi∣dence) I haue cherisht, onely waiting this happie opportunitie to make them manifest to your Lord∣ship: where nowe if (in respect of the knowne distance, betwixt the height of your Honorable spirit, and the flatnesse of my poore abilities) they turne into smoake and vanish ere they can reach a degree of your merite, vouchsafe yet most (excellent Earle) to remember it was a fire that kindled them, and gaue them life at least, if not lasting. Your Honors patronage is the onely obiect I aime at; and were the worthinesse of this Historie I present, such as might war∣rant me an election out of a worlde of Nobilitie; I woulde still pursue the hap∣pines of my first choise; which hath since beene confirmed to me by my re∣spected friend the translator, a Gentleman most sincerely deuoted to your Ho∣nor: For the subiect it selfe I dare say nothing; since it is out of my element to iudge. But I haue heard others report it (and some of them also iudicious) to be a thing first and excellently written in Italian; then translated into French, and generally receiued in both those toongs through all christendome for a faithfull, elegant, sinewie, and well digested historie: what the beauties of it are now in this English habite, I make your Honorable Lordship the first and most competent Censor; wishing that before you begin to read farther, you could but reade my silence.
