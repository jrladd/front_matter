WHen I had employed
sometime in transla∣ting
Ouids Metamorphoss,
and had achyued my
purpose in parte ther∣of,
intendyng to haue
trauayled further: I vnderstoode
that another had preuented me. And
so, after that I had receyued copyes
therof from the Prynter, I was re∣solued
to stay my laboure, & to reserue
that to the vse and behofe of my pry∣uat
frend: whych I intēded to haue
made comen to euery man. How be it
because I knowe my selfe on dyuers
causes aleged to your worship, being
no lesse lerned your selfe, then affecti∣oned
to euery cōmendable faculty, ha∣uyng
nothyng more fyt at this tyme:
I thoughte it good to gratefye you
wyth some part therof, and that not

altogether vnder the note and figure
according to the text. Aplyenge also
a morall to the Fable. And because it
hath pleased you vppon youre good
wyll, rather then for the worthynes
hereof, to accept & cōmend my Copye
in wrytyng: I am now therfore bold
to publysh it in prynte vnder the pa∣tronage
of your name. The rather to
amēd the volume of thys other histo∣ry.
And thus neither my first labours
shall altogether syncke: nor I shall
seeme to abuse the wryter, or reader
of those foure bookes of Metamorphosis,
whych be so learnedly translated all
redye. Thus yours for his small
powre assured. Wisheth you Galenes
health, ye good fortūe which Policrates
enioyed for the most parte of hys life,
and Nesters yeares.
