Honoured SIR,
THo' some may accuse me of Presumption, in of∣fering this Collection of Letters to your Patronage, without ha∣ving the Honour of your Ac∣quaintance; yet, considering the Merits of the Noble Au∣thors concern'd in it, and your own, all Impartial Judges will acquit me, and applaud my Choice. Since not to know the Interest you, Sir, have in the Republick of Letters, and what our Country has ow'd to the happy Counsels of your Great

Ancestors, is to be equally un∣acquainted with our History, and with all those whom you Honour with any Intimacy. In the first we shall find, what a considerable Figure Sir Ralph Sadler, your Noble Progenitor, once made in the Publick Af∣fairs of this Nation. Among the latter, we shall meet with no Man more Celebrated for the Politer Studies, and that true Generosity, which compose a Fine Gentleman: and in you, Sir, give us an agreeable Proof of the present Care Providence takes of Eminent Merit.
The Reputation of the Viva∣city and Wit of my Lord Ro∣chester, is so establish'd, that it is not in the Power of those Ill∣natur'd Criticks, describ'd by Himself, that

Are dully vain of being hard
to please,
to lessen his Esteem. The great Success of the First Volume, has made this evident; of which this Second (I hope) will be a farther Proof.
The late Duke of Buckingham, Mr. Savile, Sir George Etheridge, bring their own Credentials: And as for the rest that make up this Book, I shall leave them to their own Desert, be∣ing convinc'd that no Apology will ever prepossess a Reader to the Advantage of whatever wants Force enough to recom∣mend it self; and all that a Man can say, is taken (like Court Recommendations) for Words of Course; tho' I might here be allow'd to be Impartial,

where I have nothing of my own to bribe my Opinion. But, Sir, as I offer the Diverting Part to Your Pleasure, so I must that, which may prove other∣wise to Your Generous Prote∣ction, with him, who begs leave to subscribe my self,
SIR,
