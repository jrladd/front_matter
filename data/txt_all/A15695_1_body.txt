MADAM,
I Know you are troubled about many things; nor can it bee otherwise, such is the trouble of entertainement. I shall call off your minde but a very lit∣tle, and to very good purpose; though yet I shall not minde you of that you so well know; that but one thing a∣mongst many is necessary: nor yet will I be your Monitor, sith you are so well instructed that way, remembring you to make sure of that one thing
 necessary, because it is the better part, beyond com∣parison the better.
This only, I will tell you; Herein, though it be specially intended for a Childes use, yet you may read your selfe first, and that is a very great lesson; then your graces, and wants too (all have them, even the best of all) your duty also. And towards the end you may read mighty words (they are not mine) which will minde Martha of Maries part, and, which is the Crowne of all, minde her to make choicetherof in season, and that is the only meanes to make our end joyfull. I have no more to say, when I have told you, I am your friend; This is true, but I am not so familiar, ra∣ther, for so low I am.
