Right Honorable,
THough the Government of a Cōmon-wealth be not a Head or quarter of the Municipal Law of Law, and so the pra∣ctical Lawyer, little needing to study or know that point; yet most Students are from their ingenuous Education something seene in universall
 learning, and from that not ignorant of Po∣liticks; That providence which ordained you (my Lords) to so high trusts, gave you souls large, and of capacity for the places. You must know, both from your reading and experience, how to supply whatever might be defective in the most accurate settlement of a Common-wealth and how to governe according to eve∣ry establishment; and know what is to be done, to proportionate the whole in every part, should necessity enforce any alteration. You are not unworthy men, whose ambition have made them catch at worthy places, and satisfie their consciences with a deliberative Vote, though they know no rule of Law; you are not onely knowers, but lovers of Wis∣dome (and Justice is a right witnesse, other∣wise a foole might, going according to his light, a childe, or woman, give as good a judgement as the ablest Philosopher.) Judge∣ment is a deep fountaine, whose bottome each Bucket cannot arrive at; It's given to them that seeke after it, (that is, by due search, and enquire into each particular action, and qua∣lification of himselfe and others; for he must read himselfe well, who will know others aright): You are Sages, men, quick,
 and ready, from long experience to determine, not onely in the deeper questions and reso∣lutions of the Law, but also in the nice quaint subtilties of wit and practice. I just∣ly apprehend my inability to bring forth ought worthy your view, but I seeke not applause nor acceptance to or for my per∣son; but my aime, desire, intention and prayers are for the publike, for the good of the Common-wealth, that each person in his place, and each place to the person might be so setled, constituted, and fitted, that the establishing of part, might but make the whole more glorious and lasting; It is an age of Interest, great, never greater; your places are high, and your patterne will be exemplary. If ought here convince you that any thing may be done for the better∣ing of the Common-wealth; be active in it, delay not, it's a season of Judgement as well as Interests; and its truly noted, neither have Mercies allured, nor Judgements terrified hitherto. You know, not onely the secrets of Government, but of Judgement: you may thence conclude how much more wise∣ly, God deales in his both governing and
 judging the world: Its a truth in Politicks to the State, as in reason to the person; Laws must be as well fitted to the times and of∣fences, as cloathes or shooes to the body or feet. Was it not a Tyranny to cut the stran∣ger shorter that lay in the Tyrants bed, to the dimension of that, as well as to stretch him that was too short to the length? There must be a jealousie lest the Lawes be alter∣ed, and the principles of property and pri∣viledges lost by degrees: but let it be so, that we lose not more by the contest, then we can gaine by having them; You are to declare the Law, but Evidence that Law sa∣lutary to the people, or you ruine us. You say, better an ill Law then none: And I say, better Judges to execute necessary pow∣er, though it be a question whether legally they have that power, so it were fit they should have it, then to let people do inju∣stices for want of a Law, or power to en∣force that Law. I leave the thing with you: the Lord set it home to your hearts, that what is just may be done justly, and the cry of the oppressed may cease: In prosecu∣tion of which, I shall ever begge the assistance
 of heaven upon you and your endeavours, and labour to approve my selfe a friend to En∣glands Law, my birth-right, and
Right Honourable,
