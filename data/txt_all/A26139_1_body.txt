May it please your Honours,
I Have ever better understood mine own Disabilities, then to desire to appear in Print, where the Author stands as a Butt to be shot at, by the sharp Arrows of every busie Critick, and runs a most certain ha∣zard, and most uncertain Benefit: But having been above twenty three years in Chancery, and other Courts of Justice; and spent more

then One Thousand Pounds, in vindicating the Kings Grant of Printing the Common Laws of England, and His Lawful Power to grant the same, and kept His Title alive even in the worst of Times (when 'twas re∣puted unlawful, because the Kings▪) I cannot refrain from defending it, now the King is, or ought to be, restored to His Rights again; especially since all Persons are invited by Order to speak their Minds freely con∣cerning this Subject: So that there is a Necessity upon me to speak now, or for ever hereafter to hold my Peace; this being probably the last time of Asking.
'Tis not unknown to every Member of each House, how little Benefit hath accrued to the Kingdom, by the late Act of Parliament for two years, Entituled, An ACT for preventing the frequent Abuses in Print∣ing Seditious, Treasonable, and Unlicensed Books and Pamphlets, &c. Which Act determines June next: Nor can it be thought, but that there is cause enough for another Act to take place, when this is ex∣pired. The Reason why this present Act hath operated so little is most apparent; because the Executive Power is plac'd in the Company of Sta∣tioners, who onely can offend, and whose Interest it is to do so: They are both Parties and Judges, and 'twere a high Point of Self-denial for Men to punish themselves: But they will wipe their Mouthes with Solomon's Harlot, and take it very unkindly, if the same, or a greater Power be not continued to them in the next Act to be made: They will promise as fair as the Long Parliament did to the late King (to make Him a Glori∣ous King) and perform it as certainly as they did too.
Jugglers seldome shew the same Trick twice together; and the Italian Proverb is, If a man deceive me once, 'tis his fault; if twice, it is mine own: That the Great Councel of this Nation, should further trust those that have deceived them already, and believe fair Pretences, contra∣ry to Reason and Practice, would be a sad Fate upon Us all; when wofull Experience tells Us, That if the King be taken from being Head of the Law, there will not want a Law to take off His Head in a short time.
There were a sort of People in King David's time, which imagined Mischief as a Law; as in the late King's time, that practised Mischief by a Law: Which might incline the Parliament to frame a strict Law against this kind of Mischief. But I hope the King's Mercy in forgivin such, (by which He imitates His Maker) will find so hearty a Conversion, that Ingratitude shall never joyn with Rebellion, to provoke a Tyrannical Go∣vernment

over this Kingdom: such Men (if I may so call them) are worse then the Gentiles, of whom St. Paul saith, That having not the Law, and doing by Nature the things contained in the Law, are a Law unto themselves, which shew the Law written in their Hearts; nay, worse then Beasts, who by Nature observe a Law amongst themselves.
Shall Sense and Reason alone teach Creatures willingly to confine them∣selves to certain Rules for the Common Good, and shall Professors of Chri∣stianity break them? Shall the Law of Nature command Men to be free from offending; and shall the Law of God be thought to command them to be free to offend? Let not our too-near Neighbours the Turks have that Advantage against Us. But whilest I declaim against others for break∣ing their Bounds, I may be thought guilty of committing the same Errour myself; I shall therefore most humbly beg your Honours Pardon, and rest,
