To the worthy (and by me much Honoured) Master IAMES METTAM Esquire, &c.
SIR,
BY that generous and noble Chara∣cter, which long since I have heard confer'd upon you, my sole ambition was to attend so happy an opportuni∣nity as to be any way knowne unto you: But when time so farre seconded my wishes, that upon an unexpected meeting I was made so for∣tunate, not onely to be admitted into your company, but accepted into your knowledge, (for which I stand much ingaged to your kinse∣man and friend Mr. T. B.) I instantly ap∣prehended that report came much short of your worth and merit, which (I ingenuously con∣fesse transcended my expectation;) for be∣sides your generous affability and courtesie, (the most gracefull garnish, and best decore∣ments that become and adorn a true-bred Gentleman) finding you not onely gene∣rally

addicted to the incouragement of all good Arts, and Sciences, but especially to the professours of Literature and Learning, and when upon further discourse I understood, that you more particularly had not only took view of some of my weake Labors, but crow∣ned them with your Verdict: These induce∣ments so farre emboldned mee, as to offer these my unpolisht papers to your perusall and patronage, which if you shall be pleased to coun∣tenance; I shall remayne confident against all malicious prejudice: desiring rather to stand to the judicious censure of one truly rationall, then to the ignorant Nonsence of a numerous rabble. Worthy Sir: complement is a thing I have ever studied to avoid, and (I presume) you were never pleased to affect: then in a word, wishing you the accomplishment of all your noble desires, alternatly corresponding to your worthy deserts, I commend you (my gene∣rous Patron) to the Almighties gracious pro∣tection, ever remayning,
