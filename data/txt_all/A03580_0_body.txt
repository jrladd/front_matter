WHen I presented this little booke in writing vnto you (right Honouraâˆ£ble) I did little thinke that it should haue come vnto the Printers hand: but the Staffe being shewed vnto diuerse men that were desirous to know the vse thereof, I thought the labour would be too long to teach euerie one, and to write it out continually, the pains would haue bin much more. Therefore to saue both my paines in writing, and my labour in teaching, I could finde no better meanes, then to commit it vnto the presse. Considering then that it must abrode, I beseech your Honour, that it may appeare vnder your name, that as it pleased you at the first to giue it a friendly entertainment, so now you would also be Patron vnto the same, that your authority protecting, and your wisdome allowing it, you may stay the vnaduised censure of some rash conceipted men. Wherby I shalbe both encoraged to a further study, and bound to pray for your Honours increase in all good things.
