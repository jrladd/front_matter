SIR,
You having heard a Sermon publickly delive∣red on the 24 of May, 1660, a day set a∣part (as we heard) for thanksgiving to God for the happy recal of his Majesty King CHARLES to his Kingdomes and people, were pleased to request a copy thereof, which I not knowing how to deny to a Gentleman so well deserving, and so much of him who hath no greater ambition then to be responsal to that goodness which in this age is grown so rare a dainty; In obsequious∣ness to your demand I have here made that a Present to your Eye, which you formerly tasted by the Eare, not ex∣pecting that the Pen should express the lively Energy of the Voice; yet as Pictures sometimes please where the lively Motions are not found: so my hope is you will fa∣vourably accept in writing what you approved when vo∣cally delivered. The danger of fawning we are not igno∣rant of, the breath of palpon's is infectious, a taint to the receiver, treasonable in the speaker. Yet may we not refuse to give just praise, thereby to avoid the suspicion of Parasitisme. Your religious minde is manifest in your actions, in your publick attendances, and private duties, exemplar in both, to your neighbors abroad, to your family
at home. Your love to distressed Ministers in the late stormy times, though you had not a Cave to hide them in, yet you wanted not an House to entertain them, nor a munificent hand to relieve their necessities, which how∣soever they be resented by some, will be no less then Aro∣mates in heaven. Your cordial and constant loyalty to his MAjESTY hath been sufficiently known to those that know you, and as much may be said of your sincere affe∣ction to the Church of England, which speak for you to all not misled in a distracted and confused generation. What these might do with others I know not, they are strong motives to me to prize your worth, and prosecute your person with respect. May it please you to accept what I have done, and what my desire is to do to serve you, that shall more oblige him who is, and resolves to be,
Sir,
