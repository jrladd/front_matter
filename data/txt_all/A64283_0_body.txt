Dearely beloved,
THe true Israelite (you know) is a stranger in the world, marvel not therefore that he cometh unto you in a mean dresse: yet being glorious within and bearing the live∣ly image of God upon him, he doubt∣eth not to find acceptance with you his brethren, and with all true Chri∣stians. As for any other, he needs not care, what they either think or say. I begin with you the inhabitants of the city of Dublin in Ireland: Ex∣cuse
 me for not nominating any, since your number is so great as by your voluntary subscriptions for my em∣ployment and maintenance amongst you, in a booke yet kept by me, may appeare; that if I should name some, and should pretermit others, and misplace any, not knowing after so long absence and at so great distance, what alterations time hath wrought among you, I might give some of∣fence, I believe I shall never forget your great and constant affection to∣wards me, since my first coming a∣mong you, how cordially you embraced my person, how readily and gladly you received the Gospel wherof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God gien unto me for your sakes, while I was with you; how freely and plentifully you contribu∣ted towards my maintenance; and, since my removal from you by the clandestine practices of some, (who then seemed to stand for the English interest, but since have beene dis∣covered
 to be worse enemies within than any without could be) how mind∣ful you have been of me, and still are, as all that come hither from you do certify. I cannot, and hope you will not, forget how many dayes of humiliation, even once a weeke for two yeares space, we kept together in publike, during the time of our sad distresses, when our onely weapons were prayers and teares, when your city was environed round by hostile forces, and in no lesse danger by rea∣son of intestine foes, when our ene∣mies were furnished with dayly sup∣plies of choise Commanders and Armes, from forrein parts by popish adherents; and in the meane time, all help (except from Heaven only, which was thereby rendred more sig∣nal) was denied us by the obstruction of long continued contrary winds, out of England; and by implacable dissentions (which in that juncture of time was far worse) falling out in the bowels of our native country,
 from whence under God we could only expect reliefe; what flockings were there then dayly by all sorts to the Courts of Gods house, as of doves to their windowes, in such abundance that diverse knowing men have been heard to say, that they hardly ever saw so great a concourse, the number and quality of the persons consider∣ed, in all their lives in any other parts of the world? And how often have we seen God in the mount, a present help in the time of trouble? What blessed returns did the Lord continually make to our humble sup∣plications even to admiration? what great successe did the Lord then graciously give to the word of his grace, in converting some, in strengthening others, and in comfort∣ing all? How great violence did the kingdom of Heaven suffer among you? so that God heard your voice, and you hea Gods voice, and in the end he admistred to us many causes of publike thanksgivings, turning
 all our prayers into praises for his audience, and our wonderfull deli∣verances. We have seene five to chase an hundred, and an hundred to put thousands to flight. It would seeme incredible to many, if one should re∣late to them but one half of that which the Lord hath done for us, which we have seene, and know to be most true; we can subscribe a pro∣batum est to the soveraigne vertue of fasting & prayer, whereby Israel-like we had power with God and with men, and prevailed, Genes. 32.28.
But now Satan envying at our prosperity, and having great wrath, because he knew his time was but short, found out new stratagems ad∣vantagious for his destructive ends. First now was a new court of delega∣tes erected by arbitrary power among you, in the room of the high Com∣mission formerly by authority deject∣ed, but this was the same with the former (and far worse) the name on∣ly,
 being altered, and rightly was it termed by some, a spanish inquisi¦tion, by others the Abomination of desolation. The men authorized to be Judges in this delicate Court were such as professed themselves to stand for the interest of the Irish rebells, one of them boldly affirming in the pulpit in your hearing and mine (as by diverse sufficient witnesses can be proved) that These Warrs are for us Bishops, which Maxime had beene formerly divulged among the people, but more secretly. Whereupon Dr Beadle, Bish. of Kilmore a most worthy and learned man in a vehe∣ment indignation against the same when he first heard thereof, burst out into this expression, If we Bps be the cause of this horrible tempest, let them take us, and, with Jonah, cast us all over board. Another of the inquisi∣tors, being an Irish man by birth, in the same pulpit excused the discon∣tented gentlemen, meaning the rebels his countrimen, disswading
 the Soldiers from vigorous prosecu∣tion of them, and the Judges from condemning such of them as had beene taken prisoners in open hosti∣lity, unless two or three witnesses should first depose, that to their know∣ledge the said prisoners had before in cold blood committed things wor∣thy of death, whereas we all know that those bloody Canibals murther∣ed man woman & child, except here one, and there another, escaped by Gods extraordinary preservation, as one of Jobs servants escaped from the Caldeans, and another from the sword of the Sabaeans, onely to bring the sad tydings to their Master of what had been done to the rest of his servants, and to his cattell. At the same time did this merciful Ora∣tor, directing his words to me who then sate before him, with his fore∣finger pointing at me, condemne all bloody preaching and praying a∣gainst them who he said were Christi∣ans, and admonished me and all o∣thers
 from using the like for future time: whereas our Preaching was to animate the soldiers Couragiously to prosecute so just a warre against such unparalleld murtherers; and our Prayers were, that the righteous God would teach their hands to war and their fingers to fight, what other lan∣guage he used, I have in writing, attested by the hands of good wit∣nesses.
A third man, was a civilian, who had been unhappily intercepted from going beyond sea to be bred a Jesuite, yet retained his Jesuitical principles. These with some others ejusdem fur∣furis with their revived oath ex-officio, imprisoned some, and banish∣ed or drove to flight others, to the number of fourteen in one week, some whereof might be truely called, The Horsmen and Chariots of your Israel, who stood day and night in the gap for you, being able, peace∣able and diligent ministers of the Gospel, besides many others who were
 driven away by this tempest.
After this, a new project, of far more dangerous Consequence, was promoted by a faction in the army siding with the Irish party: to wit a cursed Cessation was hatched to be made with the Irish rebels, when we were masters in the field, and our ar∣my was maintained mostly by the spoiles which they dayly recovered from the enemy, who had formerly made a prey of all the estates of the English throughout the land, ex∣cepting some few cityes and castles which stood out upon their owne de∣fence, and could onely preserve such goods as they had within the walls in most places.
The very mention of this designe was odious to all the remnant of our English nation, who utterly abhor∣red the thought of ever shaking hands with such a barbarous gene∣ration of men, or rather incarnate devils, who had robbed them of all, burnt their dwellings, murthered
 their wives, children, and kinsfolk, after they had exercised upon them all imaginable cruelties, as full well you know. And all that had but half an eye foresaw what the issue of this would be, as afterwards the event manifested, even a deadly snare to our side: now were our brave soldiers left to starve in their garrisons, many of them punished with death by their owne disaffected officers upon the least complaint of any of their inhumane perfidious enemies; whilest they were free to kill, rob and spoile at pleasure without controule, and hereby had they opportunityes of recruiting themselves with fresh men and am∣munition for a new war, when the cessation should be expired: now were foure of our best friends privy coun∣sellors clapt up in the Castle of Du∣blin for opposing the Cessation; when all the rebels who had been commit∣ted, having beene taken prisoners by our army in the open field, were re∣leased, and some of them dubbed
 (forsooth) for their good service; and more of our Ministers were driven to follow their brethren to shift for their lives and safety by flight: some for preaching and praying against the Treaty, as in duty and conscience they thought themselves bound to doe: o∣thers for feare lest they should be de∣stroyed, if it tooke effect. Thus were we (like Levi) divided in Jacob, and scattered in Israel.
But since my departing from you, I have beene exceedingly desirous to returne to you, insomuch as I once ad∣vanced as for as Nesson towards you, and thence was turned back; how ever I am still mindfull of you, in my Prayers on all occasions, sympa∣thizing with you; in your straits and dangers have I condoled with you, and joyfull have I been and still am at your deliverances and enjoyments of mercies, as at the present to heare of your welfare, that the Lord hath placed over you a prudent, well principled and religious governour
 in chiefe, and others subordinate magistrates men of Courage, fearing God, hating covetuousness; that the Lord hath stored you with able, con∣scionable, orthodox divines. And in testimony of my thankfulness I send unto you (since I may not come over to you my self) this small tract have∣ing thoughts of preparing a larger treatise for you upon a subject which I made entrance upon, while I was among you, entitled The way of salvation, which may therefore more properly be layed claime unto, by you; as this present Treatise more pecu∣liarly belongeth to my now pari∣shioners of East Greenwich, a∣mong whom most of the contents hereof have been published in di∣verse sermons in the pulpit; though here much contracted, and in other particulars enlarged.
And now to you do they come from the Presse (my loving Christian friends and neighbours of East Greenwich, and no lesse beloved) for
 the helpe of your memories, and for a permanent testimony of my thank∣fulness for all your loving kindness from the first day of my coming a∣mong you till his present time, which I shall never be forgetful of. viz. how unanimously you made choice of me between six and seven yeares a∣goe, to be your Minister, three Lords dayes together meeting for the con∣firmation of your choice, and for con∣triving the best way for my better encouragement and subsistence a∣mong you, and continuing your reall affection for the far greatest part of you till this day towards me: and I trust that your love is of the right kind which will not decrease, but encrease more and more, till death put a period to our lives. I shall not deteine you long in this praeludium, as I have done my remote friends, be∣cause you have me dayly with you upon all occasions to speak unto you viva voce. Onely thus much I can∣not but signify to you in as publike a
 manner, as I could devise, that I am yours, and most unfainedly do I desire, and accordingly (by the Lords assistance) I shall endeavour the spiritual and eternal welfare both of you and yours in striving to remove all the hinderances thereof, and in faithfully revealing to you all the whole counsell of God, that I may be kept cleare from the blood of pre∣cious souls, and so save my self, and them that heare me; for, for none o∣ther end do I desire to live among you, and for this I humbly and ear∣nestly implore your dayly Prayers to God for me. To whom I commit you, and to the word of his grace, which is able to save your soules. In whom I remaine.
