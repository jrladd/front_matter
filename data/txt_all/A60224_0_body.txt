SIR,
I Had no sooner dress'd this German Heroine, in an English Habit, and taught her our Dialect, but that my high Obligations to you, brought you fresh into my Memory, with all the re∣quisite Accomplishments, for the Prote∣ction of so brave a Stranger, against the most severe Insults, that Malice, and Envy, could produce; in which choice, Sir, I have been further encou∣raged by that singular Affability and Bounty, which renders you the Delights (of the most ingenious) of both Sexes. And tho I was somewhat ashamed to pre∣fix

your Name to so mean a Subject, as these Results of some hours of my lei∣sure; yet, I thought it much better, to take this opportunity, to write your Pa∣negyrick, having so large a Field, as your Merits to exercise in, then to ap∣pear wholly insensible of your generous Favours, till something more sutable to your noble Genius should offer it self. But then, reflecting on your Avertion, to all Encomiums (tho never so justly due) obliges me to lay aside all other thoughts, than of craving your favoura∣ble Acceptance of this trifle, and of subscribing my self,
Sir,
