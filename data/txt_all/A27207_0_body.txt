SIR,
WELL knowing that among that Variety of Learning, in which your Genius has always exercised itself, you have been particularly delighted in considering this Terrestrial Globe we inhabit; I have been free to inscribe these few Considerations, thereunto relating, to your Name; being lately written by me on a Book, entituled, The Theory of the Earth, offer'd to the Publick by a Learned Person. This Un∣dertaking was very casual to me; for you know, a few years since I was upon another Design, first recommend∣ed to me by your self, which would have taken up my thoughts for some Years; but I had no sooner printed a draught of it, when an ill juncture of times hapning, it caus'd me to lay it by. To such Providencial disap∣pointments all Men must submit, nor has it been any way uneasie to me to have been baulkt in writing The Natural History of a County, the Considerations here in hand be∣ing as far more Noble than that other, as they are of a more general Extent; and I would I had been as able to per∣form

well in them, as I am conscious to my self, how in∣competent the narrowness of my thoughts may be for sol∣ving the Great Aenigma of the World, as to the rise, tendency, and periods of it, Points consider'd in this Work. Indeed, when first initiated in Religion, we have a Do∣ctrine deliver'd us concerning them, which by faith we re∣ceive, and in which (as in duty bound) we acquiesce. And nevertheless, as we grow in Years, the mind of Man, urg'd on by strong and Luxuriant Instincts, falls natu∣rally a considering how far they may be resolvable by hu∣mane Reason. And though, perhaps, how great soever a Mans Instincts may be, we may not arrive at a full satisfaction in these matters, but by an Enlighten'd and Prophetick Spirit, which God vouchsafes not to all Men; yet, at least, as far as Reason will bear, Men may be aiding to each other by an Intercommunication of Thoughts, while we stand waiting at the gates of Truth, till God is pleas'd to open to us; And, as for what I have offer'd in this kind, I freely submit it to your Censure, being,
Sir,
