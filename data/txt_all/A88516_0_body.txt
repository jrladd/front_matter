My Lord,
SInce I have overcome my nature to so much impudence as to throw this little thing at your Lord∣ships feet (though it be with the same devotion as the old superstition inscribed the names of their greatest Dei∣ties upon their meanest Do∣naries) I conceive my self

oblig'd in justice to give you an account of what I have done, and for what causes I was ambitious it should live under your shadow, that so I may be in a greater possi∣bility of pardon, in case your Lordship descend to take no∣tice of it, by diverting, so far as to a perusall, from your high Judiciall Trust, and those noble endeavours which employ you in the Best and Justest cause that ever mankind can engage in.
To make therefore the best thrift I can with the time which possibly your Lord∣ship may waste in running over these miserable sheets, I doubt not in the first place to professe, that this addresse is such, that upon the best consideration I could make, I could not avoid it, as not finding a better protectour for such a discourse then your Lordship, who as you are in∣trusted with the greatest ci∣vil employment that this Nation can make use of,

and to civil persons Lon∣ginus (who I dare say writes up to his own rules) tells us he intended it, so you will find it a short draught, or to speak rashly, a kind of prophecy of your own most excellent elocution.
In the 2d I consider'd that as Greece had the greatest Ascendant over Eloquence of any nation whereof we have memory or acquain∣tance, and so deriv'd it to Rome, and thereby for any thing I know) to all the West,

so know I not whether this great Critick (for even so his own age acknowledg d him, insomuch that Euna∣pius whose profession this was, and who hath put up∣on the file the Eminent of his Time, mentions him no otherwise then , and from thence Athens her self not onely employed him to put an Asterisme or spit upon Spu∣rious things of the Ancients, but the glorious and unfor∣tunate

Zenobia gave him occasion of bravely dying for her in being her Secre∣tary) may not now though hoary and dismembred (for time hath wasted him to what you see) find accept∣ance with a person that in the Hurricans of these great Transactions, is se∣renely pleased to throw off the publick person, and a∣dopt into his tendernesse and protection all that, un∣to which worth and letters may make a claim.
'Tis an easie objection, my Lord, that from the difference of Tongue, and Time (which ever change the conceptions of men) this piece must be look'd on as obsolete, and to this age not at all pertinent, as that which expects men to learn their Eloquence from their own Genius, rather then the Schools, which manacle it with these old maximes; but yet if we will remember that though the old Tacticks and Strata∣gems

are, by the invention of Gunpowder made in ef∣fect uselesse in this age, yet the greatest Captains have made considerable use of them, and from Histories of different Climes and Gouernments, Politicians draw no small advantage; so in this very point of Ora∣tory, if we remember how those wrastled with the dis∣advantage of single nature, and at last threw it into Rule, reign'd over the minds of men, and did many

strange things, we may con∣sider that these old precepts may very well conduct the greatest wits, and the sharp∣est observatours, through those obstacles which other∣wise they might not so easily overcome, as we see Logick files and keens the Reason of many men, who otherwise had been blunt and in the wedge, and in Tongues, (which is the onely distin∣ction of man from Beast) 'Tis a rare happinesse per∣fectly to overcome any

one without Grammer.
Though I am to yield thus much, that the Crisis of eloquence is not a little altered; In Senates and Harangues to the people length was necessary, for the same men acted both parts, (and that in a single Citie) & that which was necessary to gain the people, degenera∣ted in time to be in fashion in counsel, so that this was play'd for a prize, and was held so far unnecessary, that as if the best Masters had

not been enough, it was the care of parents themselves to instruct their children, who seeing it the readiest way of advancement, were not like to be wanting in e∣mulation and indeavour, whereas now the Scene is changed, and (in Civil mat∣ters) we are to speak to the few and not the many: For as the corruption of time hath diseas'd most Go∣vernments into Monar∣chies, so the least of these few populacies now in being,

is too great to be included in the same walls, or brought to the hearing of one voice (long studied Orations be∣ing become uselesse) and therefore as men now en∣deavour to summe up their Notions, and draw them into a sharp angle, expecting reason should overcome, so in the management and con∣ueiance of that reason, there must be needfull so many ar∣tifices, charms, masteries, and such subtle conducts, that without them a man cannot

so well obtain his end, and a man of skill that brings not so much force of reason may easily avoid them.
By this time it must be necessary (since I have talk'd so boldly) that I ex∣plain my conception of E∣loquence, which though I think 'tis such a thing as we may rather Ideate and wish then describe, yet when once a man is of opinion (and I think there are few dissentors) that the end of Oratory is to per∣swade

or Gain, I think he wants not a description, which if I may language is this, A way of speech prevailing over those whom we designe it prevail. This is if we will take it in the short or Laconick way, a distilling our Notions into a Quin∣tescence, or forming all our thoughts in a Cone, and smiting with the point; if the more spacious or Asia∣tick 'tis hard to describe, but in its own manner, 'Tis

what Tully sayes of the , Resultance and to be gathered not express'd, the Galileans Via lactea a conflux of lesser starres clear yet undistinguish'd, the Chymist's Elixar con∣teining all Qualities in it, yet not one perceivable; 'Tis Empire wholly command∣ing, yet never to be com∣manded.
But this my Lord is a thing so unattainable, and Nature hath seem'd to have placed it so farre above

the reach of man, that not∣withstanding all the ad∣dresse and advantage it gives to publick persons, all the means and establish∣ment of future fame, the number of Oratours truly great, is scarce equall to those precedent ages where∣in letters have thriven: The encouragement of Greece and Rome brought it up in their severall times to an admirable height, but this was so fatall and so verti∣call, that it could in neither

countrey stay an age in its Meridian, but it declined immediately; And in that Age it was but one or two who by sovereignty of Geni∣us and strange indulgence of their starres could become consummate, and triumph in a true perfection, though ma∣ny others offered at it, ra∣ther to the commendation of their excellent endeavours, or their happinesse in some particular kind, then in at∣taining the whole Tour en∣tregent, and sway thereof.
It must therefore have somewhat I cannot tell how divine in it, for it depends not of the single amassing or embrodery of words, there must be in it, excellent knowledge of Man, deep and studied acquaintance with the passions, a man must not onely know very perfectly the agitations of his own mind, but be seen and conversant in those of others, he must know all what the Sciences & Pru∣dence teach, what history

hath remembred, he must know the instinct, and regu∣lar motions of nature that all may proportionably re∣semble her that she may ne∣ver be overdone, or too near the life. And yet all this without somewhat which I cannot expresse, is but the smallest part that goes to the building up of such a prodi∣gy, there must be somewhat Ethereall, somewhat above man, much of a soul sepa∣rate, that must animate all this, and breath into it a fire

to make it both warm and shine.
I conceive therefore my Lord, that this being a bu∣sinesse wherein man can onely, and that so hardly, be excellent, and withall a thing of so tender a nature and easie to be offended in, that the observations of re∣gular and vast minds ought not to be neglected in it, e∣specially considering how ea∣sie and willing we are to ad∣venture and transgresse, in things which nature seems

of herself to teach us, and therefore was I the readier to make this publication in acknowledgement of what my self had profited by this curious monument, and ha∣ving no better Present, I was encouraged by your Lordships generall indul∣gence and affection to all learning, to make this choise not without deep acknow∣ledgement of your Lord∣ships favours to my self, which besides the shape and apprehension of your great

worth, fully seated and ru∣ling in my soul, will tyme in all the thoughts and actions of my life, zealously to aim at the Honour of Being
My most honoured Lord,
