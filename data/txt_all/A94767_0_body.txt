Most dreadly lov'd Sovereign,
I Am still upon the part of a Divine Adventurer, when I thought I should have been secur'd at the In∣suring Office by the Advantage of Leisure: In this I have only told the Subjects of their Dutie, and had not Time to inform them of the successe and Blessednesse of that Loyaltie, which would have brib'd them into an obedience to your Sacred Ma∣jesty, and a thankefulnesse (at least a pardon) for these Allegiant Instructions. I have there∣fore onely told them of the former, because in the pursuit of Businesse, and flight of Time, I was so suddenly engag'd upon the Vocal delivery of this, immediately after the forming of it by a Night-pen, that nothing but the zealous Vocal∣nesse could have held my eyes waking; Ingag'd upon it by the irresistible Importunity of a Second Hammond,
Mr. T. Pierce. so I call him for his Early and emi∣nently-Learned Love and Truth to God's King
and Church; for both of which, and for one Reason more, he is the Desire of our eyes, because His Ripenesse having, long since, anticipated His Years, He, in some measure, resembles that King, whom, during all His Exile, he hath so Industri∣ously honoured, (so wisely and beneficially to the King's Liege People, to the very making of them Liege People to the King) as if present amongst us; since that Heathen Complement,
Caesaribus virtus contigit ante Diem, hath been a Christian sober Character more of your Royal Father, and of his Royal Son, than of all the Princes in Europe before you.
Most Royal Sir, Though most of your Pulpit-Subjects are abler, yet, every one of them (my very Fathers too) must pardon me, that I am not able to yield to any, in a zeal and Duty to my King, to the very laying downe of my life at His Feet, and for His Service; no, not to those to whom, under my King, I vehemently desire to swear a Canonical Obedience; because then I must take two Oaths more, those of Allegiance and Supremacy.
Adeo & tenuis Animas ferit aemula Virtus.
