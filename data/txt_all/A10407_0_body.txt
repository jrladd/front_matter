Right Worshipfull,
I Have observed in private families, that the carefull father disposing of his chil∣dren to several imployments, sends some to school, some to his plough, some to his flocks, while perchance the young∣est, as uncapable of greater businesse, has the libertie to play in his hall. So is it in our Society (which joy∣fully acknowledges you our carefull and indulgent parent) those of stronger abilities, more reading, and longer experience, are busied some in one, some in ano∣ther of the graver and more serious studies: while I, the last of that learned Body, am task'd to these light∣er exercises. Accept, Sir, a thing born at your com∣mand, and preserved by your patronage. Not but that I vow the fruits of my more precious houres to your service: for when I consider the magnificence of our buildings, the riches of our endowments, the great ex∣amples of those before me, and all these bless'd in your auspicious government; I finde a fire kindled in my breast, whose flame aims higher, and tells me, so glorious a hive the royall Founders meant not to shelter drones. So wishing our whole Body long hap∣py in so provident a Governour, I rest, what my oath and peculiar ingagements have bound me to be,
