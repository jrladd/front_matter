My Honour'd Friends,
DEath is too common a Theam, and too obvi∣ous to our Sense to be thought strange, any more than that we live. But that the Course of our Life, as to the Rise, Pro∣gress, and Period of it, is at the dispose of one common Lord of all, because it belongs to a Sphere above Sense, is little considered by the most. To you, I doubt

not, its far from being a new or unfamiliar Thought. And thereupon, that the Precious Life you have lately seen Fi∣nished, was measured by Him who could not therein be unkind to him who is gone; or to you who stay behind.
We do, indeed, Tempt our selves, if we expect from his kindness, unreasonable Things. As that he should, to Gratify us, alter the Course of Nature, or recal the Vniversal Commission of Death, or only let it stand in force with an Exception, as to our selves, our Relatives, and Friends, or that he should tear his own most inviolable

Constitutions; by which the pre∣sent State is to be but Tran∣sitory, and the future the only fixed State, which were to subvert the whole frame of Re∣ligion, to nullify the design of Redemption, to take down his Tribunal, to abolish and lay aside all thoughts of a Judgment to come, and finally to make the Kingdom of His dear Son to terminate in a Dunghil. While no such wish hath place with you, your Reconciliation is easie to the Providence that hath for the present bereaved you of so delectable a Relation. And the Love of God, which prevailing in you, will prompt

you to compliance with his will, must be the evidence of your ti∣tle to the best Blessings of both Worlds. For both the things in the other State the Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, &c. And the Concurrent Operation of all things for good in this present State, do all belong to Persons of the same Character, The Lovers of God, 1 Cor. 2.9. Rom. 8.28. Which that you may constantly and fully experience to the end, and in the end, is the serious Prayer, for you, of
