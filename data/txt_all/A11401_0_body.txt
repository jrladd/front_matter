YOur long experience, both of the French estate, & language (Right worshipfull:) the report of your wisdome blossomed in youth, and ripened in yeeres, increased by learning at home, and confirmed by trauaile abroad, haue drawne me, a poore nameles countriman of yours, to make choyce of your woorthie title to countenance the forefront of this frame: and your iudgement to censure the priuie con∣ueiances thereof. The peece of worke which I offer to your patronage and iudgement, was vndertaken in the nonage of my studies, before I was professed, and per∣haps had beene smothered from the world as an abor∣tiue, had not some my deere friends weaned it from my hands, and fostered it in their affectionate bosoms, pro∣mising it life and light, if not with me, without me: yet not in respect, either of the matter which is heauenly, nor the Author which is excellent, desired I to silence my in∣fantlike pen from proceeding heerin: but bicause this most Christian Poet, and noble Frenchman Lord of Bartas, might haue been naturalized amongst vs, either by a ge∣nerall act of a Poeticall Parliament: or haue obtained a kingly translator for his weeke (as he did for his Furies:The king of Scots translated his Furies.) or rather a diuine Sidney, a stately Spencer, or a sweet Da∣niell for an interpreter thereof. For so was I put in a false hope by some, that the liuing Pen of that worthie decea∣sed knight, had amongst other his charitable legacies bequeathed a rich suit, after our best English fashion, vn∣to
this honorable Poet: and therefore suppressed my ragged weeds, till I perceiued their promise shrunke, & my expectation still naked. And yet if any of the fore∣named Heroicall Spirits haue vndertaken the perfor∣mance of that act, I would not haue my seelie daies worke to preiudice their Weeke, nor my moat to flutter in the presence of their bright beames: wherefore though my rash quill hath tooke a further flight into this translation: yet haue I pinioned vp the rest of hir fethers, and suffered onely the first daies worke to passe abroad: till I may vnderstand whether any of those sweete recording Swans haue waded in the deriuation of these streames or no: which if it be true (as I rather wish it, then enuie at it) I am content that my homely translation be cancelled: onely this forefront would I haue preserued, as an old ruinous wall, not for the work∣manship, but for the monument of some famous inscrip∣tion therein contained; so may it stand as an heape of stones, not onely rebounding a short eccho of Dubartas his stately voice; but also lifting vp the accent in the sounding praises of Master Anthonie Bacon: and subscribing to the mani∣fold prayers for his health and happinesse, with Amen.
