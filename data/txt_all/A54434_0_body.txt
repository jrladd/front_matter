YE the Born of God of the Incorruptible and Immortal-Seed of the Covenant, which is AMEN for ever and ever. In the substance which ministreth you Dayly-Bread, and the fresh and new wine of the kingdom, mine endless Love reacheth you, and with the sweet Armes of the Grace and Peace of my Heavenly Father I Embrace you; I Greet, Salute, and kiss you, one by one, yea, all as one (in the one only, in whom is no Variation or Changing) with the undefiled lips of Sincerity, which never uttered Uncleanness, Lewdness, Deceit, or a Lye; Feel and know mee as near you as the Flesh which cleaveth to your Bones, as purely and perfectly in you as the bloud of Life in your hearts.
Ah Sion! if thee I forget, let my Bowels burst in my body, and let my Carcase quickly become meat for hungry Eagles, and let the Vul∣tures also tear my flesh from my bones.
I cease not Night nor Day in every Watch to present you as a li∣ving Sacrifice upon the Altar in the Holiest of Holiests: And I full well know that when fire is kindled in your proper habitations (which is the Seat of God's Rest) I am as a writt of Remembrance before you.
God Almighty Augment your portion as faithfull Stewards, and continually of his fulness give you all fulness: Though I am as the Least, and as a Door keeper in the house of God, yet of a truth the Vertue of the Lord God is with mee.
The which I have to say, that you all in my behalf be full of the praise of my Heavenly Father in your hearts, and that your Thanks∣giving in Spirit may abound before him, Amen.
The God of peace possess your soules to the utmost in his everlasting peace, And the most Dreadfull Lord of Holiness preserve you to pass the time of your Pilgrimage in Feare and Trembling. Againe I say unto you Feare, Dread, and Tremble yee before the ever living God.
