SIR,
IT is no part
of my de∣signe
in this
Dedication,
by the reflexion of
smooth language, to
shew you yourselfe in

your glory, or to take
the worke of admi∣ring
your worth, out
of the hands of all
the world, who are
now very intent, and
busie at it. If honour
and approbation will
pay debts, the Nation
(I conceive) is not
much behinde with
you, for all the service
you have done it: for
(as farre as I under∣stand)
you have scarce
enemies enough, to
deliver you out of the
hand of that curse of

our Saviour, Wo be to
you when all men speake
well of you, Luk. 6. 26.
I have no authority to
question the single∣nesse,
and upright∣nesse
of your heart, in
those notable and
noble engagements,
that are upon you:
yet if you will plead
your selfe to doe it,
the security attending
thereon, will beare
the charges. When
credit and conscience
are yoked, and draw
the Chariot together,

Conscience (oft∣times)
proves dull,
and heavie in the
worke, and if not
sometimes remem∣bred
with the goade,
and put on, will suffer
credit to draw all on
the one side, and so
lay her fellow on the
wheele. It argues an
high, and excellent
frame of spirit where
a man can follow
with intensnesse of
minde, things that be
of good report, and
yet not be over-acted

with the goodnesse
of the report; but
fetch the strength of
that inspiration, by
which hee is carried
on in his motion,
from the goodnesse
of him that hath com∣manded
it. The more
God is interessed in
our intentions, the
more he is like to in∣terest
himselfe in our
executions. If wee
make him a stranger
in the proposition of
our ends, hee takes no
pleasure to make him∣selfe

knowne unto us
in our prosecutions,
except it be by way
of opposition, and
rising up against us.
The royall method in
great actions, to
breake all difficulties,
and barre off discou∣ragements
in sunder,
as with a rod of iron,
is to digge out of our
selves as much of our
earth, that is, as much
of our selves as wee
can come at, and fill
up the pit, or empty
place, with God and

zeale for his glorie.
The consecration of
an enterprise is sove∣raigne
against abor∣tion,
whereas to
worke for a mans
selfe alone, is little
lesse, being inter∣preted,
than to betray
his action, and to
give security to his e∣nemies,
that God
shall not build with
him, nor prosper him
in his way: and con∣sequently,
that his la∣bour
in building shall
be in vaine.

The least offensive
(I am sure) and yet
withall, (with serious
and inside men) as
weightie a testimony
(as I conceive) as can
be given to your wis∣dome,
is to speake
thus in the plaine dia∣lect
of the ancient
simplicity unto you,
and not to spare
you, as farre as the
truth may doe you
good. Neither doe I
conceive, wherein a∣ny
mans worth or
wisdome can do him

better service, than by
strengthening others
to lay on himselfe to
beare greater weights
of this treasure, than
men of an under-suf∣ficiencie
are able to
stand under.
The Disciples them∣selves,
were great
loosers (for the time)
by their weaknesse,
in this kinde; they
wanted the sweete
company, and con∣verse
of many high
and important ap∣prehensions,
which

(doubtlesse) had bin
equall too (if not
much better then) the
society of so many
Angels, because in re∣spect
of the present
infirmity of their spi∣rits,
they were as un∣able
to beare the
strength of their in∣fluence
and working,
as the frailty of the
flesh and blood is, to
abide the glory and
presence of those Em∣bassadours
of heaven.
Their gratious, and
great Lord and Ma∣ster

himselfe, plaine∣ly
professed this unto
them: I have many
things (saith he) to say
unto you, but you cannot
beare them now, Joh. 16.
12. And had they
not out growne this
weakenesse after∣wards,
by meanes of
that golden showre
from heaven, where∣in
they were rained
upon with the Holy
Ghost, and with po∣wer,
they had beene
kept fasting from the
feast of those fat

things (whatsoever
they were), all the
dayes of their lives.
The reason why
the world (so gene∣rally)
drinkes old
wine (in our Savi∣ours
Metaphor)
which is of a lower
and flatter taste, is, be∣cause
their vessels are
not new, and strong:
and therefore not fit
to have new wine
(which is of a stron∣ger,
and more lively,
of a more stirring,
working, and pro∣voking

spirit) put
into them for feare of
breaking. Wee have
but the light of the
Moone instead of the
light of the Sunne, or
at most, but the light
of the Sun, instead
of the sevenfold light
of seven dayes, pro∣mised
Esa. 30. 26.
shining to us, because
wee are tender eyed,
and inconsiderate∣ly
afrayd, lest an ex∣cellency
of know∣ledge
should undoe
us.

Not to wrong (in
the least measure)
the rights of Heaven
in point of thankful∣nesse,
due from us,
nor to quench the
least sparke of the joy
of our congratulati∣ons:
for the blessing
of knowledge pow∣red
out unto us so a∣bundantly,
above the
line and measure of
former ages, certaine
it is, that truthes of
highest importance,
and which should
joyne Heaven and

Earth neerer toge∣ther,
and heale a great
part of that deplora∣ble
distance, which
yet lyeth betweene
men and Angels, and
so advance and quic∣ken
the spirituall en∣tercourse,
and com∣merce
betweene the
two worlds, are little
stirring in the world.
One maine reason
whereof is, because,
as the Disciples of
Christ, when they
saw their dearest
Lord & Master com∣ming

towards them
upon the water, were
sore afraid, and cryed
out, supposing he had
beene a spirit, that
had appeared as an
executioner of pre∣sent
death upon
them, who yet was
the glory and crowne
of their security: so
many in the world
(no worse affected
neither, to the truth,
in generall, than
they were to Christ)
crie out, as men out
of measure troubled,

at the first glimme∣ring,
and appearing
of some truthes unto
them, as if they were
the spirits of Devills
comming upon the
world, for the spoile
and ruine of the pre∣tious
soules of men;
whereas, were they
capable of their in∣spiration,
and either
did, or were but in∣wardly
willing to
know of what spirit
they were, they could
not but acknowledge
and confesse, that

they were of the dea∣rest,
and deepest, and
sweetest confederacie
with Heaven. It was
Austines complaint
long since: Nonnulli
intelligentes citius vo∣lunt
exagitare, quod non
intelligunt, quam quaere∣re,
ut intelligant, & non
fiunt humiles inquisito∣res,
sed superbi calumnia∣tores,
Aug. de Temp.
Serm. 72. I forbeare
to make English of
this Latine: because
the party chiefly in∣teressed,
are (for the

most part) men of the
language.
But Sir, I consider
the weight and im∣portunitie
of your
present imployments,
I know you are (with
your worthy Assi∣stants)
about a great
and laborious cure,
(the Lord prosper it
under your hands)
and farre be it from
mee to desire, that this
should suffer in the
least, through any oc∣casion
of mine. I had
not presumed thus

farre, but that this
little piece had stucke
in the birth some
yeares together, and
was well neere sti∣fled,
found now a
way into the world,
by the providence of
God, and by the be∣nigne
aspect, and in∣fluence
of that happy
constellation, where∣in
your selfe shine as
a starre, in much glo∣ry.
And the subject
of it being of that
neere affinity and sym∣pathy
with the sove∣raigne

piece of that
great worke you have
in hand, the rescue,
and advancement of
the Gospell, I should
(I conceive) have
turn'd my backe up∣on
that providence
which look't mee in
the face, if I should
not have presented it
to some of those
Worthies, whom
God hath anointed
with wisdome, grace,
and power, as for the
bringing of many
greater, and weighti∣er

things to passe, so
(the event bearing
witnesse) for the hel∣ping
forth of it also
into the world.
In which great and
honourable assembly,
I knew not one,
whom rather to cast
mine eye for this de∣dication,
than on
your selfe, who, as
you are knowne to
the whole Nation, by
your worth and zeale,
for the things both of
God and Men, so
have you beene

knowne to my selfe,
heretofore, by some
more particular ac∣quaintance:
the dis∣continuance
and de∣crease
whereof, I im∣pute
onely to mine
owne unworthinesse,
and negligence in ad∣dressing
my selfe un∣to
you.
I doe not in these
meditations put you
upon any thing (in
the maine) but where∣in
you have preven∣ted
my motion, and
are already home-en∣gaged:

I know you
are in for the Gospell,
with all your heart,
and with all your
soule, and if with all
these, with all whatso∣ever
besides. So that
you might (in that
respect) expostulate
with mee the imper∣tinencie
of this my
addresse unto you, in
those, or such like
termes, .
What neede you
quicken him that maketh
haste? Yet make I no
question, but that of

your selfe you know,
how fairly to salve
the seasonablenesse,
and usefulnesse here of
notwithstanding: In
which regard, an a∣pologie
would prove
the impertinency, not
the Dedication. I ve∣rilly
beleeve, that P
never met with Chri∣stians
so abundant in
the worke of the
Lord, but still hee ex∣horted
them to a
bound yee more.
Besides, though I
cannot say with the

confidence of an in∣tuitive
knowledge,
that you meete with
any secret feares, dis∣couragements,
con∣flicts
of doubtfull
thoughts, and reaso∣nings
with your selfe
in the way of that
contention for the
truth, which now you
sustaine: yet can I
hardly beleeve, but
that sometimes you
feele the activenesse
of the powers of
darkenesse against
you, and finde some

insinuations, and
grudgings, (if not
stronger, and sharper
fits) of feares tou∣ching
the successe, and
issue of your great
undertakings. In
which respect, I con∣ceive,
it should not
be unseasonable alto∣gether,
to administer
unto you, of those
excellent comfortati∣ons
and strengthen∣ings
of heaven, which
the Holy Ghost hath
treasured up in the
Scriptures, for such

times, and occasions
(especially) as these.
The Lord Iesus Christ
himselfe, being in
deepe conflict, was re∣freshed
by the pre∣sence
of an Angell
from Heaven com∣forting
him, Luk. 23.
43. The consolations
of the spirit in the
Word of God, admi∣nistred
by a hand
consecrated thereun∣to,
have sometimes
beene little inferiour
in the glory of their
effects, to those of

Angelicall dispensa∣tion.
I dare not under∣take
for any sapienti∣all
advantage you are
like to gaine for the
Faith, by the perusall
of these few pages:
I know if there bee
any to be gotten, you
will not overlooke it.
Yet give mee leave to
say this: that the
best and wisest mens
thoughts, apprehen∣sions,
purposes, ends,
intentions in their
best actions, will ne∣ver

lye right, and
straight in their bo∣wels,
nor with that
ease and intimate sa∣tisfaction
to their
owne spirits, except
they be marshalled,
ranged, and com∣posed
by the hand of
the spirit of God,
stretched out from the
Scriptures.
The God of grace
and glory, who
in your selfe, toge∣ther
with that wor∣thy
Senate of joynt
consultations with

you, hath opened a
doore of hope to a
Land and People,
brought very low,
and hath begun by
your mouthes to
breath upon the dry
bones, so that there
is some noyse and
shaking heard alrea∣dy,
bring them to∣gether,
bone to his
bone, and flesh up∣on
them also, in due
time, and cover them
with a skin, and put
a spirit of life into
them, that they may

live: and recom∣pence
abundantly
into their bosome,
the labours and tra∣vells,
and faithful∣nesse
of those, whose
hearts, and hands
have beene, and still
are lifted up to
the worke, that ta∣sting
the presence,
and mightie hand
of God with them,
they may rejoyce as
strong men to runne
the remainder of
their race, and not
faint or waxe wea∣rie;

till the great
breach bee repaired,
till the throne, and
kingdome of Iesus
Christ bee lifted up
on high, above the
rage, power, and
contradictions of
those, that seeke to
lay the glory of it
in the dust; till
judgement runne
downe like water,
and righteousnesse
as a mightie streame,
to wash; and carry
away all the filth;
and noysomenesse

of the Land, till
the hearts, and
mouthes of all those
who love the peace,
and prosperitie of
the Nation, bee fil∣led
with joy, and
gladnesse, and the
faces of all that are
enemies unto it,
with shame, and
confusion. And for
your selfe, your
personall honour,
peace, and safety,
you have an inter∣rest
in your selfe
(which sleepeth

not) in the pray∣ers
of
Coleman-streete
Decemb.
