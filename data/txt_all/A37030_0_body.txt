SIR,
IN the view of these bleeding times I am bold to pre∣sent unto you A Contemplation of Mans Morta∣itie. a subject indeed really intended upon the death of your most valiant and undaunted Kinsman Major William Pchard (the worlds valour) who (of all men) chose me for his Minister at his execution, and I in lew of his approbation, presume to present this unto you, and the rest of his friends and kindred.
And as Hannah when she had presented her young Son Samuel unto the Lord, did make him a little coat. So have I put this my little childe into a new coat, and am bold to present it to your Noble Favour for protection. Vouchsafe therefore to take it by the hand, and I doubt not but the Ephramite shall be heard here to speake as plain at the smooth-tongued Canaanite: and so I pray God to blesse your person and affaires here that you may be kept blamelesse unto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. And this shall ever be the prayer of him, that is


Ovid Nec Leges metuunt — Maestaque victrici Iura sub ense acent.
