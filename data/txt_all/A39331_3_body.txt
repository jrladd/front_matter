Most Eminent and Illustrious SIR. May it please Your Excellency,
THe Glory of all Arts is Action, the Honour of all Action is Vertue; the Crown of all Vertues is Perfection: the Excel∣lency whereof, (according to the perfection of Humanity) is so essentiall in your Excellency, that you are become, at once, the Wonder, and the Honour of Europe, neither can that immortall Fame of Yours be conceal'd from the rest of the habitable World) who shall from age to age record, and from Antiqui∣ty to Infantry relate those matchles Victories, and unimitable Atchievments, which the Bounty and Blessing of Hea∣ven hath enrich'd your Hand, and beautified your Name withall. In all whose Honourable and succesfull Under∣takings, I had an aime at no greater happinesse, then to have been the least Part in so noble an Imployment under your Excellency, towards the per∣fecting of the welfare and Happinesse of this Kingdom, and Common-wealth, had not the Military Affairs of this Honorable Metropolis unavoid∣ably engaged and obliged me to attend the Service of their own Militia. And therein my Lo: I have spared neither diligence, nor Study, that might conduce to the great work of Arms, then in Embrio, now in perfection, ex∣cepting only ppposition and Envie, which the greatest Honours never yet were free from: A part of which perfection hath always flowed from the industry of the Officers, and practice of the Students of that Warlike Univer∣sity wherein, although I have not (as a Member thereof) with such dexteri∣ty
 as Cad∣mus sent out well experienc'd Souldiers in a Day, yet have I not layn so idle, as Lepidus, and wish to be warm'd more from the Sun than my own labours; of which the effects are now upon the publick Test, but more formidably under your Excellencies censure: to whose Patronage and Protection I have presumed to devote this eldest Son and First-born of all my forepast Studies, Practise and Employment in the gradation of Military Affairs. All the fol∣lowing sheets, which relate to that Heroick Subject, such as they are, and in such a dresse, as now they have put on, sub∣missively and primarily present themselves, with all their worth and beauty, (if any be discernable within them) unto Your Excellency, as to their tutelar Angell, and most Ortho∣dox Warriour, that either Pole can boast of. In confidence, there∣fore, of your Excellencies native Candor towards all Ingenuity, (and more especially that, wherein your own transcendent, and un∣parallel'd Honours are more perspicuously and really delineated, than all the vain and empty Glory of the Dull and Phlegmatick Pretenders to Chivalry can be Map'd, or Landskip'd by the effeminate hand of Flattery) this late abortive, in full shape, due proportion, and, (if Truth deceive me not) in just maturity, hath broken from the wombe of my seven yeers endevours to see the Light both of the censorious and judicious World, and in that Light it cannot but live; if your Evcellencies goodnesse shall vouchsafe to foster it, and must not die, except your displeasure please to wound it. And whether this shall live or die: I shall not further aspire at any loftier pitch of Honour, than to have Commission, to subscribe my self
