Noble General,
SEriously considering with my self, what great pains the Parliament of England hath for these many yeers taken in their Diurnal and Nocturnal lucubrations, and constant sitting in the Parliament-House in West∣minster, now for the space of these full 11 yeers last past; to the great neglect of their Country-occasions, their wives and families, and much impoverishing divers worthy members in that honorable Assembly, and all under pretence of a perfect Re∣formation, both in Church and Commonwealth, if an honest man may believe them; and it may be divers of them, in the infancy of this Parliament and Commonwealth, had cordially intended the same; but how the devil hath cast his club over their procee∣dings, according to the old English Proverb, and the great Je∣hovah blasted all the spiritual hopes of so great a blessing, of their good intents, and his kindness and mercy, to and upon this Nation and Commonwealth, let the world judge, by the evils past, and daily still threatned; therefore certainly it is to be feared that there are some Achans in the Camp, (which caused Joshua to turn his back of the men of Ai) which must be sought out;
 for they be troublers of Israel, and of a truth have taken the silver, and wedge of gold, and the rich Babylonish garment, ex∣pressed in the 7 of Joshua, and the 21 verse; which hath so dis∣pleased the Lord, that he turneth his back of his own people, in this good work of reformation. And therefore, my Lord, not impertinently, but very properly and prophetically was it spoken of that gentleman in the house of Commons, much about the time when the plenipotentiary Commission was given unto the late General the Lord Fairefax, then Sir Thomas Fairefax, about the time of the new modellizing of the Armies now under the Command of your Excellency; who (openly speaking of the late tyrant and murderer, justly destroyed by a providential hand of supernatural power) said, that there was a Jonas in the ship of this Commonwealth and English Nation, that resisted the im∣mediate commands of the Lord of Hosts, and King Jesus his Son, your Lordships and Armies, and this present Common∣wealths great Captain General, and he that hath given your Lordship all your recent victories against the enemies of this present Commonwealth. And so long as Jonas was in the ship uncast overboard, in vaine was it for the Mariners to labor or velificate against the seas, windes, and stormes which the liv∣ing God had raised against the ship wherein Jonas was; (as ap∣pears by the first Chapter of Jonahs prophesie, unto the 15 vers.) untill Jonas was cast overboard, and then the storme ceased. But, my Lord I am affraid there be abundance of Jonases in the ship of this present Commonwealth, that if they do not very speedily repent them, and that within few dayes after they shall have notice of this Metaphorical ship, which is to be built by your Lordship, and the Armies, and Commonwealth, with all speed, if you intend to assist King Jesus in deposing of all the kings of the earth, and think your self fit to be a weddinger at the marriage of the Lamb of righteousness, which is very live∣ly and plainly laid down and expressed, in the 19 of the Revel. of Saint John, of which the penman hereof is confident your Lordship is very well versed in.
And, my Lord, I let your Lordship further know, that if your Lordship will be a means to save all the blood which will be shed
 upon mankind by the ensuing plague (which if this ship be not built and sent to sea) will inevitably follow this Summer up∣on the males of the English Nation, foreshowen by the great So∣lar Eclipse, happening to be upon the 29 day of March ensuing; when of a truth parcel of mother Shiptons prophesie will come to pass) and save your honors life into the bargain, that you forth∣with call a Council of the most faithful and most Christian Of∣ficers, friends, and ministers of Jesus Christ, to consult with your Excellency about the meaning of this Metaphorical and Hieroglyphical forme of a ship platformed unto your Lordships hand; and out of them to Elect you a person so qualified, as is in the same described, for the speedy velification thereof, for the purposes in her remonstrances expressed, in such manner and form, and with such velocity as is therein described, to be cer∣tain that she return before the 14 of May next; for in case she do not, wo be to the man-kind in England: and as I am a mem∣ber of Jesus Christ, and of this present Commonwealth, I as∣sure your Lordship, foreseeing these great evils to come, out of my duty to the Commonwealth, and the love to my own coun∣trymen, and honor to your Lordship, and soldiery, who hath with Gods blessing freed me from the tyranny of a temporal Prince, by often adventuring of your blood in the field, for the good of the lambs of this present Commonwealth, like as my blessed Saviour by shedding of his innocent blood, for the redemption of my soul from my scarlet sins committed in my youth, and therein hath not only made me free in spirit from the curse of his hea∣venly Father, due to such miserable sinners as I do confess my self to be; but also hath freed me from the bondage of Satan: therefore about the 16 of Novem. last, I did seriously resolve to abstaine from bread or food for six whole months, to make me to humble my self to the living God, the Father of all spirits; hum∣bly and constantly beseeching of him, for the Lord Jesus Christ his sake, to avert his heavy judgements hovering and pendent over the head of this Nation, pointed at shrewdly by the Astro∣logers this yeer; being in that confidence that King David was in (expressed in the second book of Samuel, at the 21 vers. of the 7 Chap.) who fasted all the while the child was alive, pre∣suming
 of the goodness of God; for, said he (at the 21 verse▪ the said Chapter) Who can tell whether God will be gratious un∣to me, that the childe may live? And without doubt, if David had humbled himself sooner, before the living God had pronounced the letter of Mort against the infant by the prophet Nathan, I am confident God would have been gracious unto him, and the childe had lived: and so I am confident also that if the pen∣mans directions be timely observed about the ship herewith first dedicated unto your Excellency and your Armies, and then to the Commonwealth, the judgement determined, shall be sus∣spended, as in Ahabs case, recorded in the 21 Chap. and last ver. in the first book of Kings, upon Ahabs half-way-humiliation. But what should I trouble your Lordship with examples, when your Lordship may very well be my School-master! But, my Lord, it is possible your Lordship may shew these presents unto some scoffing Ishmaels, or Davids fools; but they be well described in the 53 Psalm, vers. 1. Take heed you do not believe them; for their ways be corrupt, and will do what they can to ensnare your just soul, which I am confident stands as yet right in the presence of my King, your Generalissimo, and for ever will be confirmed, if your heart stands right with the wayes of the Lord, and continues but as perfect in Garison, as it is in Field against your enemies; and so, my Lord, I rest;
Given from my quarters neer the Black-dogg at Newgate, this 7. of March 1651. being four moneths of my voluntary fast of the six months e∣lapsed.
