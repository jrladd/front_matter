WHat it pleased your Honour to desire, may it please you also to accept (a poore mans Sermon.) J have no other plea, nor other hopes nor meanes to finde Grace in your eyes (seeing J am a stranger,) but onely for that Grace's sake, which is the Theame and subject, the pith and marrow of my text. Jn a word therefore, As Iacob prayed heartily for his sonnes, when they went to present themselves before Ioseph.

Gen. 43. 14. God Almighty give you mercy in the sight of the man: such i my hearty prayer to Almighty God; God Alâˆ£mighty give mee mercy in your sight, and you in his sight. Oratum est.
