MY LORD,
THe Reason, why I de∣dicate this Treatise to your Lordship, is not any opinion I have of the Merit of the Book; but my remembrance of your former Fa∣vours. I am sensible, how much I am obliged to you, and though I have often professed so much in pri∣vate, yet I look'd upon the Duty, as imperfect, without I made some publick Acknowledgement; and though the Book may not be wor∣thy

of your Patronage, because it comes not attended with new No∣tions, yet I thought it safer to run the hazard of being judged un∣learned, than that of being count∣ed ungrateful.
My Lord, you were the Person, who first took notice of me in the University, and by your Sun-shine, warm'd and cherish'd my Endea∣vours, and gave Encouragement to those Studies, I am now engaged in, and as under your Shadow, I then advanced, and prosper'd; So now, that the Fruit, though of a courser sort, is come to some ma∣turity, it was but reason, you should have a taste of it. I know not, how pleasant it may be to your curious, and delicate Pallate, but your Piety is such, that you can disrelish nothing that tends to the Exercise of Real Godliness.

A Subject indeed, on which Millions of Books are already writ∣ten; yet such is the Richness of it, that every day it affords new mat∣ter for Contemplation; and though what we write is nothing, but a different Dress of the same Good Angel, yet even those different Garbs, and Habits may help to∣wards the Enlargement of its Splendor and Glory. To Plant Goodness in Men is without doubt the indeleble Character of our Of∣fice, and to make Souls fall in love with Heaven, the import of that Duty, whereby we hold our Char∣ter; and we have the greater rea∣son to attempt it in an Age, where∣in Religion, like the Poets Eccho, is become an empty sound, and try how far we may bring that Faith into fashion again, which former∣ly, when times were better, dis∣covered

it self in suitable Works and Actions.
St. Paul's fight with Beasts, one would think, is still entailed upon our Function, and the difference between his, and ours, seems on∣ly this, that his was at Ephesus, and ours in the places where we do Officiate; for the Brutal Lusts of Men are now as strong, as ever, and it's hard to say, whether our Task be not the more difficult of the two, since, besides his Preach∣ing, he had the Mantle of Elijah, the Power of doing Miracles; and we only the ordinary Assistances of Gods Spirit. It's true, the World is Christian now, whereas it was Heathen in his time; but I cannot tell whether Christianism, mingled with Paganism in Carriage and Conversation, be not a fiercer Devil to drive out, than meer

Heathenism, and Black Infidelity without any White to checker it.
However we have reason to re∣lie upon his Help, who hath pro∣mised to be with us to the Worlds end; and we find by happy Expe∣rience, that our Labours are not altogether unsuccessful, where we aim at Gods Glory more than our own Interest.
We are happy in this Church, that we have so many Prelates who are bent upon reviving the strictness of the Primitive Church, excellent Patterns for us the in∣feriour Clergy to imitate, and be∣ing thus encouraged by our Gene∣rals, we must be inexcusable, if having such Monitors, we prove careless of our Duty. To reduce Christianity in Men to its Primitive

Rule, is the drift of this discourse; and as your Lordships Zeal for such harmless Enterprizes cannot be un∣known to any, that have had the Honour to converse with you; so whatever defects may occur in the Book itself, the Scope and Intent being great, I flatter my self, that though I fall short of the Mark I aim at, yet for the Designs sake, your Lordship will generously par∣don all the Faults, and Mistakes of,
MY LORD,
