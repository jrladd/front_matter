My Lord,
HAving obteined, by
meanes of Your most
noble Lady, a view of this
choise piece, which,
through Your hands, pre∣sents
in our idiome Saint
Pauls Life, in whom wee
Gentiles are so highly
concerned. My Reverence
to the blessed Apostle, and

my Duty to my Countrey,
emboldened me to publish
this elaborate transposition
of Your Lordships out of
French into English, to a
common perusal of all our
Countrey-men, who, with S.
Chrysostom, ought to de∣light
more in him, and in
his simple, yet grave stile,
then all the swelling Criti∣cismes,
or vaine Philoso∣phy
of posteriour Wri∣ters.
That I acquainted
not Your Lordship with
the publishing, I finde ex∣amples
of great Saints to

have paralleld my adven∣ture,
as, of Saint Amand
to S. Paulin, who, having
published his Epistles, sent
him a fardle of them,
which he would have for∣gotten
to have been his
own, if the veracity and
authority of the Publisher
had not forced his ac∣knowledgment.
That Your
Illustrious Consort gave
me your Book to read, and,
if upon dicussion, I should
esteem it able to bear the
rubbs of rigid Censurers,
to print it, was her com∣mendable

tenderness in or∣der
to Your Lordship, and
Christian providence in
order to the Publique;
warranted by Great Saint
Augustine in his 7th E∣pistle
to Marcelline, who
desires severe Judges as
Over-visours of his learn∣ed
Workes; and S. Am∣brose
to S. Sabinus, Epist.
63. gives the reason, Be∣cause
a mans own writings
deceive him, errours easily
escape him, &, as Children,
though deformed, delight
their Parents, so, ill digest∣ed

conceits flatter the Con∣triver.
This Work, for
the subject, commandeth
Devotion and Reverence
in the Reader, for the ac∣curate
delineation of his
Life, and learned inter∣mixtion
of other contempo∣rary
Occurrences, deserve
so ingenuous and pious a
Translator, as Your Lord∣ship.
In lieu of Transla∣tor,
I might beg leave to
say Interpreter; for, You
have not onely given us in
English the things signifi∣ed
in the French, which is

the duty of a Translator,
but you have rendered the
very mentall Conception of
the Author, which, in Ari∣stotles
stile, is the office of
an Interpreter; and, in
this, much obliged all, espe∣cially
him, who had the
priviledge to suck the first
morning sap; which, by all
duteous expressions I must
confess, who am
