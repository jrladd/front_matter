SIR,
I Having obtained a Book (of yours) Intituled to me, although (as I sup∣pose) never intended me (as by you) I thought good to peruse it, and also to give an answer to it, although I might have better improved time, and ink, and paper, than to have answered such a running kind of discourse, the which hath out run both Scripture and sound reason; but however truth hath overtaken it, and given it its deaths wound: and farther, this discourse of yours hath engaged me to speak more largely of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, and to shew how Gods Decree in E∣lection depends upon Christ (viz.) to chuse none to salvation and glory, but such as are of Christs family either actively or passively; when I say actively, I mean such as are in Christ through faith; and when I say passively, I mean all Infants that have not for∣feited
their happiness by personal transgression, for the Redemption is (a free gift, and is) as large as the transgression; so that as the first Adam lost the lives and blessing of all men, so the second Adam (the LORD JESUS) purchased it again, so that none are damned (viz. taste the second death) but such as deny the Lord that bought them, but all men must dye (the first death) or be changed, which is as death, for the first Adams transgression, and the very same all men are,
Rom. 5.18, 19 by Christ, made alive again; that is, e∣ven so many as were made sinners by the first Adam, even so many are made righteous by the second A∣dam, and so Gods mercy is over all his works: I have also answered all your Arguments and Objecti∣ons that I found to have but so much as a colour of reason in it. I have also shewed that the Jews shall return to their own Land, and that Christ shall be their King sitting upon the Throne of David in Je∣rusalem, according to the letter of the Scriptures (the truth whereof is) witnessed by the mouth of all the holy Prophets, and Evangelists, and Apostles; I have not given any interpretation upon the Prophets, E∣vangelists, or Apostles for these two reasons; First, because no person might have any colour to wave what is written (as to that subject) seeing it is the pure minde and will of God, without the least mix∣ture of mans meaning and interpretation: And se∣condly, because my occasion also would not admit of enlarging my self upon it. And as touching your Ordination to the Ministery, I have examined and shewn that your Presbyter (by which you were Or∣dained) was not a lawfull one, nor you fitly qualified and also that no man may be appointed a Minister o∣ver
any flock, without the approbation and election of the same people, and he receive his Ordination and charge amongst them in their sight, which is the ancient practice of Gods people by his command) both in the Old and New Testament: And as touch∣ing your grounds for Infant-Baptism, I find also ve∣ry weak, and that the word Baptizo is taken for sprinkling, as you say, I cannot finde any where; but I finde its taken for washing, as in the ninth Chapter to the Hebrews, and elsewhere; but never find that it will bear such a signification as to sprinkle, accor∣ding to that little knowledge that I have attained (tho∣row mine own industry with Gods blessing) in the Greek, which is indeed very small; but who may despise the day of small things, if truth be found there∣in, the which I shall leave to the examination and tryal of such as know it better than my self, without over much confidence as to the infalibillity thereof, al∣though to my best understanding it is the truth, and pertinent to the purpose that I have cited it for; and as touching your discourse of me to your bountifull friends (cited in
Your dis∣course is thus read, In lip∣sius si vera dico agnoscite si falsa ignoscite, to which you adde this phrase, ; because I speak against Ox∣ford & Cam∣bridge, as you say: Sir, is this the way to convince me, that Oxford & Cambridge is of God? I must see more sollid matter come from thence first. I shall omit citing Cyprians words. Latine and Greek) is little to your honour, knowing that evil communication corrupts good manners, for he that made me an Asse (if I be one) is the same that made you a wise man (if you be one) and also I think that he that is blinde or seeth but little, may see you to be imposterous, and so Cyprians words fitly applyed to you; and whereas you tell them that I much speak against Oxford and Cambridge learning, I might say that your eye sight was not very clear, or your understanding awake when you read my book, for I never spake against it considered as simply in it self, as a hand-maid (as I
may say) to a Minister, but I ever spake against it so as to deny it to be the efficient or suparlative cause of a Minister, and do say, that Christ ascending up on high and leading captivity captive, and giving gifts to men, is that which makes a Minister, although learning may not be denyed to be a useful hand-maid, neither may such be denyed to be Ministers, whom Christ hath gifted to preach the Gospel to edificati∣on, exhortation and comfort, although they be al∣together ignorant of that humane edification of Ox∣ford and Cambridge; and let me tell you (without offence) that I know none more ignorant in the my∣steries of the Gospel, than those of your stamp (for the greatest part of them) but I suppose the reason is, because they ascribe preheminence to that which should be subordinate. Finally, Sir, this is my advice (to you, and despise it not) be more frequent in reading the Scriptures and compare them toge∣ther, trust not too much to this or the other mans o∣pinion, for if they were zealous, yet they lived but (as it were) in the twilight; and know that near the time of the end,
1. 12.14. * men are to run to and fro, and knowledge to encrease. Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindnesse of the Lord, and that you may partake of the benefit of an understanding heart, search after it as for hidden treasure, and then shall ye finde it, and have the closet of your heart fil∣led with all precious and pleasant riches, the which is the desire of him that desireth the welfare of your soul, and all mens; who am your (and their) ser∣vant for Christs sake,
.
