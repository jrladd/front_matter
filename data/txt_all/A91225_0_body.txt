Reader,
PEruse the ensuing Votes, and then
subscribe the new intended Repre∣sentative,
or Agreement of the People,
without perjury and breach of Cove∣nant,
if thou canst; being thrice by
the House of Commons, and once by
both Houses adjudged and declared to be destru∣ctive
to the being of Parliaments, and to the fundamentall
Government of the Kingdom, which thou both by the
Protestation, and Solemn League and Covenant art obli∣ged
inviolably to maintain: and no lesse then
High Treason, as was adjudged this very Parliament
by both Houses, in the Cases of Strafford and Can∣terbury,
who lost both their Heads for endeavouring
to subvert the Liberties and Freedom of Parliaments, and
the fundamentall Government of the Kingdom: of whose
Treasons these must certainly be more deeply
guilty, who shall promote and set up this Agree∣ment,
after these Votes of both Houses against
it.
