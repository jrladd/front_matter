AS the vnskillfull caruer that
wanteth both Arte and iudge∣ment,
cunninglie to contriue
the worke he taketh in hande,
& yet able to iudge of his owne
imperfection, findeth meanes,
(for the better aduauncement
thereof) to erecte the same on
the toppe of some high piller,
or such like place, where the faulte cannot easilie be
perceiued by the curious beholders: Euen so (Right
worshipfull) hauing perfected this my Youthes witte, Or
witte of Greene Youth, (a fitte name for so simple a Sub∣iect)
I was moued, partlie of mine own accord, (know∣ing
your worthinesse, which well appeareth to the
worlde) and partely at my frendes requeste (that per∣swaded
me you would courteouslie accept it) to make
my speciall choise of your worshippe, to supporte, and
sustain by your vertue & worthines, this simple worke,
vnworthy such a Patrone. For though it be sufficiently
fraught with a few prettie conceites, yet can I not my
selfe in priuie conceite, so much loue or like it (as the
Crow that thinketh her own birde fayrest) to suppose,
it may well swimme through the sensural seas of such
as haue either high Forheads, and sharpe wittes, or
wante of iudgement, with euil tōgues, vnles it be guy∣ded
by such a Pilate, as can safelie conducte it.

May it therefore please your worshippe (of youre
courtesie) to allow my good wil, and hereafter to like
of the worke, I shall haue what I especially wish for in
this behalfe, and care the lesse for the sharpe censure
of such as disfauoure my doinges. For I know that
Apollo for all his skill, refused not to heare the harishe
Pipe of Pan, though but a rurall God. And Pallas,
though in Arte she farre surpassed Arachne, yet vouch∣safed
she to handle the thridde of her spinninge, and
to say that her webbe was wel wrought, and cunning∣lie
contriued. And Xerxes, a mightie Prince, thought
no lesse well of the poore man that presēted him with
a handfull of water, then he did of the greatest giftes
that euer anie bestowed vpon him. And truth it is,
that such men as are either guyded by the rule of rea∣son,
or indued with the courteous giftes of gratitude,
doe more regarde the minde of the geuer, then the
worthe of the presente. Therefore to conclude, I hū∣blie
beseech your worshippe, with the force of youre
vertue, to defende my YOVTHES WIT from
the malitious reportes of those that mislike, and seeke
to disgrace it: And in so doing, your worshippe shall
geue me incouragemente, hereafter to attempte a
better worke then this is: For the smallest tree, (if it
be well proyned) will prosper, and verie light laboure
not mislyked, is likely to grow so farre onwarde, as to
become Industrie it selfe. And thus abruptlie fini∣shing
these rude lynes, I committe you to the
tuition of the Almightie, Resting
alwayes
