Madam,
HEre you see, what dili∣gence I have used to involve my self into a Lab'rinth, out of which, my judgement is not clew sufficient to conduct me. I blush when I remember, how I have betrayed mine own weaknesse to the publike view; and like Cae∣crops Daughter, tempted my MI∣NERVA



to mine owne ruine, for daring to discover an Infant with such deformed feet. I have reason to feare, 'that those knowing spi∣rits, the right heires to all those sacred fountaines within the Di∣ocesse of the Myter'd Hill; those profest Champions of Poesie, who are so jealous of the Muses Honour, will be strict in their examinations, severe in their cen∣sures, and where they find an in∣truder, whose follies are stript thus naked as are mine, liberally use that lash which was justly put into their hands. But when they shal know, I am not so wedded to self-love, but that (were I per∣mitted to cast my bean into the Urne) I should bee as ready to



condemne my self, as expect my sentence from another; Perhaps, so ingenious a confession might in noble minds quite pluck out the sting of Anger, and make their reprehensions rather arise from pitty, or a Fatherly affection, then Revenge: but then I tremble to thinke how I stand engaged a∣mongst all that ignorant and cen∣sorious Rabble, who because Na∣ture (foreseeing how lavish they would be of that little which they had) durst not trust them with a∣ny considerable stock of wit, be∣leeve they are priviledg'd to cry it down in others; Men, that, con∣scious of their owne basenesse, obstinately arme against truth and knowledge, and by custome of



Malice are grown so barbarous, as they will vindicate a Prostitute, or set a spurious birth upon the highest point of Honour; but endeavour to stab their forked tongues into the bosome of the most chast and noble Virgin; my meaning is, that they will cherish common and shallow fancies; Births so infamous, that they can onely speak their Parents shame, when a Legitime Poem often falls a sacrifice to the many-head∣ed and no brained Multitude. From the rage of these, I fly o you for Protection, as confident (how desperately soever other∣wise bent,) they dare not violate so holy a Sanctuary. Nor doe I doubt, but you will guard



me from so treacherous and un∣just an Enemy, as pretends to re∣prove my Faults; but indeed acts his own Malice, and would have persecuted me worse, had this been better. Neither am I so im∣pudent, as to desire you should, against the equity of your own Conscience, defend a trifle, and approve to others what you your self mislike: No (Madame) I re∣quest you to be my Judge as well as Patron; as well to punish where you finde me faulty, as to protect me Innocent; and if af∣ter due examination had, my whole Book shall appeare guilty of cheating my Readers out of so much time for nothing, sentence it to the fire; and beleeve me, I



would not bewaile mine owne sufferings, if condemned by so Legall a Process. But if you shall be pleased to receive it into any de∣gree of Favour, I shall be secure, that it is not altogether to be de∣spised, and in that confidence, dare, both vindicate my self unto the world, and make my owne revenge of such as shall provoke me. Your wisdome, Justice, and singular affection to the MUSES, (to wrong whom, I beleeve you esteem, as well as I, a sinne next Sacriledge) may sufficiently war∣rant all men, that your Judgment will be unbias'd. Therefore as that shall determine of me, I will either quietly submit my selfe to all censures, or rise up in defence



of my Innocence. In the meane time, I will not speake one word in mine own behalfe; onely if this shall faile your expectation, and prove unworthy this Honour it is advanced to; I beseech you ex∣ercise both your Justice and Mer∣cy, burne it, but forgive him, who will ever esteeme it his greatest happinesse to be reckn'd amongst the number of
