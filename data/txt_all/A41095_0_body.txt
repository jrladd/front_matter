Right Honourable,
THE Controversial has so prevail'd over the Practi∣cal Divinity, that the ge∣nerality of Men are more studious to defend an Opinion, than to live well;
 and please themselves more in the bare Notion of Religion, than the Practice of it. So that now serious Exhortati∣ons to Piety, and to a Religious Life, are become highly necessary.
Of this Nature is the following Dis∣course; The Design whereof is, only to perswade, that Men would endea∣vour, by an holy Conversation, to a∣dorn the Christian Faith, which in words they dispute up, and pretend so much Zeal for; and that they would manifest the Reality of their Belief of another World, by their Victory over this.

That God would be pleased, not only to protect Ye from the Adversity of this World, but also to enable Ye to despise and live above its Prosperi∣ty; as 'tis the Subject of the Sermon, so 'tis of the Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
