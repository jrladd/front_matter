SIR,
THE vast and univer∣sal Influence which the Vertues of Prin∣ces have upon the Rest of
 Mankind, makes it the con∣cern of this whole Nation, that Your Highness be throughly Instructed in the Principles of our most Holy Religion, whose whole Ten∣dency is to make both Prin∣ces, and their People Happy. And when we consider that Hopeful Genius, which does already appear in Your Highness; and the very sur∣prising Account You can give of Your Faith, at so tender an Age, we may thence promise our selves, by the Blessing of God, a
 Happy Change in the Ge∣neration of Youth, now growing up; to Retrieve whom to more sober Prin∣ciples than have been found in their Predecessors, all pos∣sible Application must be us'd, or the Nation will be Undone; and to Influence to which, nothing will more Contribute, than Your High∣nesses Pious Example.
Now, that little Piece which does here presume to wait upon Your High∣ness, is an Explication of
 Your Baptismal Vow and Covenant; and this design'd to prepare You for that so∣lemn Recognition of it, which e're long we hope to see You make at Your CONFIRMATION. And as that Sacred, and Aposto∣lick Ordinance is singularly Useful and Necessary, espe∣cially where Persons have been Baptiz'd in their In∣fancy; so there is no part of Christian Institution so immediately fitted to pre∣pare you for it, as that which gives you to under∣stand
 the general Nature, Terms, and Conditions of the same Covenant, as shews you what Obligations lye upon You to be faithful in it, and teaches You how to form Your Resolutions to perform your part of it. And that Almighty God may make Your Highness a Resolute Christian Hero, an utter Enemy to Pro∣phaneness, Vice, and Wick∣edness; and may always enable You to Repel the strong Efforts of Your Spi∣ritual Enemies, which will
 do all that's possible to shake Your Constancy, shall be the most hearty Prayers of,
SIR,
