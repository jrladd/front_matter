May it please your Honour
I Am no Relative to those who court universal Favours and a flying Fame, with Ostentation of their own Abili∣ties (though I now appear on a publick Stage) I dare not presume to contend with any, but content my self in my own Sphaer, with my own Language and my own Method, lest I should seem to aspire higher than I can pretend, or falling too low be loaded with arising
Wave, and my aspiring Phantasie bu∣ry'd in a watery Grave. My Ambiti∣on is only to tell the World that I will tread in the Foot-steps of my former Loyal Ancestors; (some whereof have ventured both Lives and Fortunes in the lage Rebellion) and that I as well as they, have the same abhorrency of Rebels against my Prince. I am now under the severe Censure of the Impar∣tial Critick, yet I will not distrust the over-ruling Providence of Heaven, but that some will excuse me in what. I have done; and gather Fire from my Coal, to kindle the Noble Flames of Love of Loyalty and Religion. For as it was with the Psalmist so it is with me, to abstain from Good Words is Pain and Grief; but if the excellency of all Presents should always equal the gran∣deur
of those to whom they come, I might justly shame or blush at my bold Oblation.
But being I am not unacquainted with some part of your Virtues where∣by I am able to give the World a tast more easie to be had in admiration than imitation, I presume upon your Lord∣ship's Goodness. Your Religion and Loyalty, your Prudence and Learning, and whatsoever else is Praise Worthy, hath render'd you Eminent in one of the Noblest Employs of State wherein you Act with a General applause of the whole Realm. But that which gives a Fragrancy to all your Bed of Flowers, is that humility, which like the Violet (though the lowest yet is the sweetest.) This makes me prostrate my forlorne Papers at your Lordships Feet, beseech∣ing
your Goodness to condescend to the acceptance of these poor expressions of my respects, and to give them your Patronage and Protection, which will shield them from all Enemies, and that your happiness may extend above the reach of all, that you either can desire or deserve, is the hearty Prayer of
