SYR,
Since I had the Ioy to see you last, I haue looked a little into the next Life, as despay∣ringthat in this, I should be able to find any thing which might be worthy to fill vp that place, which is made empty by your ABSENCE. And now by chance, or ra∣ther by Gods good Prouiden∣ce, I haue met with a Prospe∣ctiue-Glasse, which giues me a view of Heauen, and Hell, in a very expresse & cleare man∣ner, though the Countreyes thēselues be far off. I should neuer haue beene able to fit the Instrument towardes any eye; but finding now, that all was ready made (and that, so excellently) to my hand, I haue aduentured to frame acase for it, after the English fashion. The thing in it self, you will not chuse but like, for it is excellent; and I am but too sure, that you wil loue the part that I haue therein; because the same Loue hath ceeled vp the eyes of your iudgement concerning me. But if (abstracting from that) you chance to like it, I shall stand in little feare of the cen∣sure of others, who must giue me leaue to belieue, that ther liues not amōgst them all (for ought I know) a man that can outstrippe you in Translating. Heerein I haue seene pretious things of your doing; both inProse, and Verse, and in seue∣rall Languages. And I neuer misliked any Translation of yours, but that one, when you trāslated your Presence, from the eyes of my body, by whose Absēce, I am in part depriued of being able to
translate some of your vertues into my soule. The least that I can do against Absence & Distance, for so great a wrong, is to send them a Defi∣ance; and to bid them be sure, that if they mean to make me loue you one haires breadth the lesse, they shal loose their labour. Nay they kindle me rather, to make this expressi∣on of my selfe; and to acknow∣ledge(as I may say)
this Statute of my hart, before the World. For I am fixt in giuing you all power ouer me, and I glory in being subiect to such a Friend.
