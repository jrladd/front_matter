My Lords,
IN Obedience to Your Commands, I pre∣sent to Your Lordships the Discourse I made before the University on our Commemo∣ration-day, which I justly fear may fall much short of that Favourable Character Your Lordships received of it from some very partial
 Auditors; I am sensible, (my Lords) that its style may appear too exalted and declamatory, and many Expressions more fanciful then may be thought by some agreeable to the Gravity of my Place, or my usual way of Preaching; but that liber∣ty I hope will be excused, in consideration of the extraordinary Occasion and Solemnity, and the numerous mixt Audience to whom it was ad∣dressed.
If it may any way contribute to Encourage the Study and Improvement of Learning, or Raise up any New Friends and Benefactors to our College, I shall think its Publication seasonable: at least, my Lords, let not any Mistakes or Weakness in it pre∣judice Your Lordships against our Society, which You have hitherto so generously and kindly Protected. The Arts and Muses are proud to call You their own, they glory in having formed Your Minds to that rare pitch of Wisdom and Knowledge which is admired by all; and therefore 'tis from Your Lordships they chiefly expect Patronage and Advance∣ment, from Your Lordships, I say, whose more liberal Education, innate greatness of Mind, and ex∣alted Station in the World, give you a privilege to Reason above the common rate of Mankind, and to Protect all such as endeavour to do so, by Your Authority and Example.

 That Your Lordships zealous Endeavours for the Good and Prosperity of this Kingdom may ever pro∣sper, and Your Government long continue a blessing to us that live under its happy influence, shall be the constant Prayer of
My Lords,
