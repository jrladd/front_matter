Religious, Renowned, and most Gracious King,
THis Small Work that chiefly concerns Kings, and perswadeth to Obe∣dience unto them, with all Humility and Submission, I, one of your meanest Subjects, present unto your Sacred Majesty, in whom
Courtesie and Clemency with Au∣thority, are transcendently Eminent; of whom, O King of Peace, I cannot but (with the many ten-thousands of your Loyal and Royal hearted Subjects) give in my Test, that Your Sacred Majesty is not onely as Da∣vid, but as Solomon, yea, the Solo∣mon of the world, who having Re∣conciled Three Kingdoms to Your self at Home, and most Nations of the World Abroad, have also tied Peace to Your Sacred Person: These Transcendent, All-concluding, and All-commanding Virtues fill Your Loyal and Royal Subjects hearts with confidence that our Eyes shall see in Your Peaceable days God's House finished, and the Temples built again that have been destroyed: And the rather have we this confidence, sith that Your Royal Majesty hath broken down the Partition Wall
of Rites and Ceremonies in the Church of England, and in the Church of Scotland, and now of Two made One: And as it hath been usual to Unite Nations, and common to call United Nations by one Name, and in them to Esta∣blish but one Form of Government Ecclesiastical and Civil, even so hath Your Sacred Majesty done, whereby the Black Monarchy of the Prince of Darkness is now cast down for ever.
Most Serene and Powerful Prince, the attractive Beauty of Your Go∣vernment draws the very Hearts and Souls of Your Loyal and Royal hearted Subjects, not onely to pay unto You what is due, but also by a Practicable Example to go before others in Obedience, for want of which many years past by and gone, through unduely untempered Zeal,
multitudes of Your Subjects denied the Magistrates of their duty, and Your Sacred Majesty the Head of all Government: By means whereof, for some small Differences, a few Error-searching Singulars out-face∣ing and opposing Ever-famous Plu∣rals, uncharitably first set the House of God on fire, and afterwards caused a General Conflagration throughout all Your Majesty's Domi∣nions, which without Art-exceeding Deploration cannot be remembred. Therefore there is great reason why Your Sacred Majesty should beware of yielding hasty belief to the Robes of Sanctimony: By their works you shall know them.
Most Dread Soveraign, By this dimme Light of a small Candle I am come at Noon-day to give what Light I am able unto the dark corners, where the Sun, nor the
Moon, nor the Stars as yet appear, notwithstanding the Eye-dazling lustre of them in the Firmament of our Church and State, the Light of the least of them being able to guide the Wayless Traveller in the darkest night.
Great and Mighty King, the Great God that hath made You thus Great, and set You up the Oracle of Kings, the Miracle of Ages, and made You to Your Enemies as a Rock invincible, against which they have, and for ever shall dash themselves in pieces, the same Great God give You the Conquest of all our Hearts and Wills, that there may be an Har∣mony and Agreement of Soul and Spirit amongst all Your Subjects from Dan to Beersheba, and that this entire Realm of Great Britain, English, Scottish, and Welch, now being framed into one happy So∣veraignty,
it is the humble Prayer prostrate upon the knees of my heart, that the Almighty Three in One, would bring us to be perfectly One.
