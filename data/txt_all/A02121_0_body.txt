WERE I as able as I am willing (Right Worshipfull) to shewe my selfe thankful for your manie kindnesses extended vnto me, some more ac∣complisht Dedication then this, should haue offred it selfe to your iudiciall view at this instant.It was one of the last workes of a wel known Au∣thor, therefore I hope it will be more acceptable. Manie haue published repentaunces vnder his name, but none more vnfeigned then this, being euerie word of his owne: his own phrase, his own method. The experience of many vices brought forth this last vision of vertue. I recommend it in∣tirely to your worships euen ballancing censure. None haue more insight then you into matters of wit. All men of Art acknowledge you to bee

an especiall Mecenas, and supporter of learning in these her despised latter daies. I am one that haue no interest in knowledge, but the inseperate loue that I beare to them that professe it: That atten∣dant loue on good letters, striues to honor you in whome Art is honoured. I thinke not this pam∣phlet any way proportionable in woorth with your worshippes patronage: but it is my desire to yeelde some encrease to your fame in anie thing that I shall imprint. Thus wishing to your worshippe that felicitie and contentment, which your owne best gouerned thoughtes doe aime at, I most humblie take my leaue.
