MY LORD,
THE most Generous Ingenious Persons do never think themselves more affronted, than when most flatter'd; because Imperfections commonly are the Objects of such Varnish, but good Complexions defie Painting: I shall therefore avoid all florulent Expressions, and make my Addresses to your deserving Person, with such Encomiums, as are only delivered to me by the Dictates of Verity, which are these:
By Divine Manuduction, Ability, Opportunity, Legal Election, and Regal Authority, you are invested and confir∣med a Vicegerent over the most Celebrious City of all Europe, LONDON; yet at such a Season, when the Trouble of the Times will prove the Trial of the Magistrate; in which, an even Carriage may render you a good Governour, of great Circumspection, and an Example for Succession, betwixt this and the Period of Time. In order thereunto, your Com∣pany have dignified your Day with much Cost, disburs'd in delightful Devices of Triumphant Scenes, and Significant Representations, to illustrate your Lordships Inauguration, and conduct you with splendour to your Center of Honour, the Chair of Government: Which, that it may prove a Seat of Safety to your self, and Security to the City, shall be the daily devout Wishes of,
My Lord,
