REmembring how many kind fa∣uours, I haue from time to time receiued at your handes (louing friend & father) yet on my part no moitie of answereable courte∣sie returned, whereby you might either finde re∣gard of your gentlenesse, or note my thankefull mind: Now at last, as neerely touched with con∣sideration of mine owne slothfulnesse, I presume to dedicate this small Treatise to you, therein to require fauour for all former wants, and in your woonted affable nature, to bury all defects on my behalfe. For the excellencie of the worke, I dare commit it to your iudgement, after reading, be∣cause I knowe you can both reade and censure: And for my selfe, I likewise with the booke, stand readie at your seruice, and to bee commaunded to the vttermost power while I liue.
