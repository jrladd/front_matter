RIGHT Honourable: I
durst appeale to the iudg∣ment
of a carnall Reader
(let him not bee preiudi∣cate)
that there is no history so pleasant
as the sacred; set aside the maiestie of
the inditer; none can compare with it,
for the Magnificence and Antiquity of
the matter, the sweetnesse of compiling,

the strange variety of memorable oc∣currences:
And if the delight bee such,
what shal the profit be esteemed of that
which was written by God for the salua∣tion
of men: I confesse no thoughts did
euer more sweetly steale me and time a∣way,
then those which I haue employed
in this subiect, and I hope none can e∣qually
benefit others, for if the meere re∣lation
of these holy things bee profitable,
how much more when it is reduced to
vse: This second part of the world re∣paired,
I dedicate to your Lordship,
wherein you shall see Noah as weake
in his Tent, as strong in the Arke, an
vngratious son reserued from the De∣luge
to his Fathers curse: modest piety
rewarded with blessings, the building of
Babell, begun in pride, ending in confu∣sion.
Abrahams faith, feare, obedi∣ence,
Isaac bound vpon the Altar vn∣der

the hand of a Father that hath for∣gotten
both nature, and all his hopes;
Sodom burning with a double fire,
from hell, and from heauen: Lot rescu∣ed
from that impure Citie, yet after fin∣ding
Sodom in his caue: Euery one of
these passages is not more full of won∣der,
then of edification. That spirit
which hath penned all these things for
our learning, teach vs their right vse:
and sanctifye these my vnworthy me∣ditations
to the good of his Church. To
whose abundant grace I humbly com∣mend
your Lordship.
