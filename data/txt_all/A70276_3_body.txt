SIR,
I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me, called the Popish Royal Favorite; and ac∣cording to your advice (which I value in a high degree) I did put pen to paper, and somthing you may see I have done (though in a poor pamphleting way) to clear my self of those aspersions that seem to be cast upon His Majesty; But truly Sir, I was never so unfit for such a task; all my Papers, Manuscripts, and Notes having bin long since seized upon and kept from me: Adde hereunto, that besides this long pres∣sure and languishment of close restraint (the sense wherof I find hath much stupified my spi∣rits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dan∣gerous fit of sickness, a high burning fever, with the new disease, wherof my Body as well as my Mind is yet somwhat crazie: so that (take all

afflictions together) I may truly say, I have pas∣sed the Ordeal, the fiery Tryal. But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see better daies I hope; for out of this fatal black Cloud, which now ore-sets this poor Island, I hope ther will break a glorious Sun-shine of peace and firm happinesse: To effect which, had I a Jury, a grand-Jury of lives, I wold sacrifice them all, and triumph in the oblation.
So I most affectionately kiss your hands, and rest
