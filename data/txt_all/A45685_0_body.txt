MADAM;
THO I readily comply'd with Your desire in preaching the follow∣ing Sermon, I could not with∣out some reluctancy consent to the printing of it: But my great Obligations both to Your deceas'd Husband, and Your self, gave Your Request the force of a Command. I ra∣ther chose to have my Pru∣dence censur'd than my Gra∣titude.

I am sensible that I studied it under a great dis∣advantage, both by reason of my bodily Indisposition, and those necessary Affairs that lay upon my hands; which made me the more unwilling to publish it. But if God, who is a Soveraign Agent, shall be pleas'd to make it use∣ful to any that read it, I shall find no reason to repent its being brought upon the pub∣lic Stage.
I hope, Madam, when you seriously consider how sutable those VVords wch I preach'd upon are to the Character of your departed Relative, it may

be a means to support You un∣der that severe Stroke which separated Him from You. He was a good and a faithful Ser∣vant, and I question not but he is now enter'd into the Joy of his Lord. His Conversa∣tion upon Earth gives You solid ground to hope that he is advanc'd to Heaven, where he is possest of a compleat Fe∣licity: And that sweet Savour he has left behind him per∣fumes his Family, now his Bo∣dy is cloth'd with Corrupti∣on. 'Tis an honour to You that You had such a Hus∣band; to Your Children, that they had such a Father.
That the Lord would supply this Loss by the more eminent Vouchsafement of his Graci∣ous Presence to You; that he would adopt Your Fatherless Children into his own Fa∣mily; that the choicest of his Blessings may constantly de∣scend upon You and Yours, is the unfeigned desire of,
Madam,

April 15th, 1700.
