Worthy Gentlemen,
WHen by your own Indulgence more than my
Desert, I was preferr'd to the Honour of
this Imployment, you were frequently pleased
to Admonish me, that I should be careful in my Studies,
and rally up all my Abillities, in the performance of this
Duty, from a consideration, that the great and good object
of my Addresses, would deservedly require my choicest
Thoughts, and accutest Contemplations; which since (upon
deliberate disquisition) I have found so true, that in my
very first attempt, I was discouraged; for the Lustre of
the Subject, began to dim the Eyes of my Fantasie, and
wrought in me a fear, That to render Him his merited
Commendation, would prove beyond the reach of all my
Rhetorick, and that I should but vainly endeavour to
discover the Sun in his Meridian, by the bashful Beams
of a Wax Candle. But my Lord is so mercyful as to
make my Errors venial: And (by his gracious Example)
I hope you will be pleased to pass by the Oversights and
Errors of
Gentlemen,
