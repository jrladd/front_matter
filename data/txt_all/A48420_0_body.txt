Madam,
AS the Memory of so dear a Royal Mi∣striss, Your own more particular, and the Worlds no less Universal Loss, is that most sacred Amulet that You wear nearest

your heart; so every Pour∣trait of that divine Ori∣ginal, tho' never so faint an Essay, carries some pretension to your Lady∣ships favourable Accep∣tance.
I confess, indeed the weakness and unworthi∣ness of my own attempting Hand in so bold an Un∣dertaking: And to excuse my Blushes, could only wish that the World would as easily pardon the Intru∣sion of so poor a Pen, in∣to

the hallow'd Memoirs of that Most Excellent Princess's LIFE; as her Funeral State will do the poorest melting Eye and bending Knee that shall approach there: 'Tis but the same Attractions that must inspire all Pens to be her Historians, as it makes all Knees her Ho∣magers.
But not to make my own want of Deserts a bar to your Ladiships good Graces, towards this

duteous Offering I make You, I must only remind You, That Medals are stampt in Copper as well as Gold, whilst the Royal Effigies both values and illustrates, at once, the meaness of the Lineaments that draw it, and the Courseness of the Mettal that bears it: And there∣fore 'tis from that Merit alone that I presume to make your Ladiship this Presentation; whilst my endeavours however short

of performance, in deli∣neating the unexampled Virtues of that more than Royal that Heavenly Life, the great Theme before me, may in some measure be a venial Fault, for all Hands must be am∣bitious to strow Flowers upon that Grave.
But whilst so large a portion of those Royal Smiles, that have so kind∣ly and so warmly shined on her most Darling Fa∣vourite, the Countess of

DARBY, have so justly entituled You to this De∣dication, I need not look back either to your Illu∣strious Descent or Alli∣ance, those great Names of Ormond and Darby, to blazon the Worth of so truly Honourable a Pa∣troness: Your Ladiship has those later Records, the fair Plumes to enrich your Coronet: For 'tis sufficient the World is too sensible, That it must be some extraordinary Me∣rit

only coud lodge You so near that Royal Bosom, a Hand that ever weigh'd where she chose; whilst nothing less than a very near Affinity to her own Exalted Virtues, coud re∣commend or Qualify for her Favourite.
And Madam, your La∣diship thus cherisht, and thus advanced to no less an Honour than that of the dearest Cabinet Con∣fident of the fair Maje∣sty of Britain, a Renown

that must give your La∣diship so lasting a Name, as shall live with Hers: This single Glory of it self alone, is not only a Pane∣gyrick to your Fame, but likewise entitles it to a Chronicle.
But Madam, as glori∣ous a Record as so fair a Theme must furnish You; however 'tis but a very melancholly One: For in recounting those envied Blessings You possest in so many Royal Smiles and

Embraces, I am the un∣happy Remembrancer of those You have lost: A Loss so irreparable, and withal so heavy, as cannot receive even that com∣mon Consolation of Sorrow, viz. That to have Com∣panions in Misery, is some Ease to the Pain of it. On the contrary, not all the Thousand Sha∣rers with You can lessen this infinite Affliction. Thus whilst I endeavour to twine your Laurels, I

wreath your Cypress too; for in telling You, That You once was the Dearest of Minions, I only pub∣lish You the deepest of Mourners.
I shall therefore quit this melancholy Subject, being
Madam,
