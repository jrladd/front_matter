MINE HOSTS,
I Hope I am not much mistaken in calling you Gentlemen, or kind Friends; if you be either, it is as much as I looke for, or can deserve; you onely are the men that do truly merit the name and title of Mine Hosts, for alas, our Citie Tavernes have no other entertainment, but Welcome Gentle∣men, a Crust, and What Wine will you drinke? But you, Brave minded, and most Ioviall Sar∣danapalitans, have power & prerogative (Cum Privilegio) to receive, lodge, feast, and fe both man and beast; you have the happiness

to Boile, Roast, Broile and Bake Fish, Flesh, and Foole, whilst wee in London have scarse the command of a Gull, a Widgeon, or a Wood∣ock; and for your further, and more high Re∣putation, the most part of your Customers come riding to your houses, where almost all our guests are footmen; with you it is com∣mon for the Master to drinke pintes or quarts ut of Pots, whilst his horse is eating of Bottles. Besides, our Citie Tavernes are not troublesome to their Clients with many vari∣ous Items, and Reckonings; but briefly, so much for Sack, Clarret, or White; whilst you have the predominance to assault a man with  Bill, and call him to a strait and strict ccount, not onely for himselfe, but for the oings of his horse; the Iury is divided or ven into five parts, in the manner of Lin∣y Woolsey; namely, the Hostes, the Drawer, e Chamberlaine, the Tapster, and the Hostler. Who having view'd the Bill of Inditement, They) being themselves, Accusers, Evi∣dence, Plaintiffe, Iury, and Iudges; the finall Sentence is pronounced at their owne Bar of ustice, where the Delinquents conscience

knowing all to bee justly laid to his charge, with patience and Fortitude, suffers the irrevokeable doome to passe upon him, paies the Reckoning, puts the Bill out of all Force and Vertue, paying his Fees, hee is discharged with a Heartily Welcome. Of all, or the most part of such Accounts, Actions, Debts, or Demands, our Citie Ta∣vernes have a long time pleaded not Guil∣ty. They cannot ee tax'd with the deadly Sin of Gluttony, nor are they troubled with the harsh musick of Trencher-Scraping, so that if I were to be transform'd, or metamor∣phos'd into a Hogg, I would bee loath to dwell in one of our Tavernes, because I should have such plenty of Wash, and such scarcity of Graines.
But Gentlemen, though I am bold (a lit∣tle) to play the (—) with you, yet I as∣sure you, I love you well; but for some more speciall love and favour that I beare to my selfe. I have written this my second Booke of Tavernes, I have not written Epigrams here, as I did upon the former, because in

City and Country the signes and the Wines are all alike.
Yet (to give all the respectfull content that I can to my Honorable, Worshipfull, and ors of my good Friends, that are to pay me money, upon the receiving, or this my shing this small Booke.) I have re∣corded in stead of Epigrams, some Monu∣ents of Antquity, which my hope is, will ee more profitable and delightfull; And Gentlemen (I meane you that are ingaged nto mee) in your just payment to mee, you may woke a piece of a wonder, (which is, o make a Rich Poet;) but alas! that stile is as much too high for mee, as I am too low for , (That's a Bull) so much the better; for al∣most all men are turn'd Grasiers, and speake ls familiarly, and those are the Mounsier Vomusses, who have sold their Wise Akers efore they have sowed their Wilde Oates; And these will censure harshly, any thing hey understand hardly, whose knowledge is as much in the validitie and measure of a Verse, as the Asse had that judg'd the Cuc∣koo's

song to bee sweeter than the Nightin∣gales.
I have laid the Foundation of this Project my selfe, it is a Vineyard of mine own Plan∣ting, the Grapes of mine owne Pressing, the Wine of mine owne Vintage (or Vantage) the Tavernes of mine owne finding, and the Vintoners my own friends, in lieu of which, I am not mine own man, but theirs, or yours, or his, or hers, that wiseth mee well, as far as my Intentions and Actions are Iust, Lawfull, o Laudable,
