I Had not suffered (right Honorable) these worth∣lesse labours of mine to haue passed to the presse, but that the importunity of many my friends haue pressed me vnto it. Quod exemplo fit, iure fieri puta∣mus, saith the famous Romane Orator. The communitie of the act, may pleade an immunitie for this mine action. As the one of them was not long since vtte∣red in your Honorable presence and au∣dience;
 so now it presenteth it selfe vnto your view and perusall. The other, which I haue added vnto it, prouided vpon the same occasion to haue bene vttered here∣tofore, preached in the same place, at the hearing of two honorable and graue Iud∣ges now deceassed, being then by other necessary businesse intercepted, reioyceth that it hath so fit oportunity now at lēgth to open it selfe to the view of the world. Though neither of them haue ought else to commend them, yet Salomon him∣selfe will affoord them commendations in this, that they are words vttered in due season, Pro. 25. 11. If God season thē Pro. 25. 11. with his grace (though men do not grace them with their fauours) it is as much as they expect, or I desire. And thus com∣mending your Lordship to the protection of the Lord of Lords, I humbly take my leaue.
