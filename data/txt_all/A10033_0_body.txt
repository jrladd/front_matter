Right Worshipfull,
THe world may well woonder what winde hath driuen these Papers of mine to the Presse, or what should presse me to send these vnpollished me∣ditations

 the Censure of the world, which ere conceiued and brought forth in fewer dayes then a weeke affords, but (be∣ing sent abroad) why I should bequeath them to your protections, none need to wonder; conside∣ring the many encourage∣ments and continuall kindnesses I receiued frō your worthy father, whose Funerals these are, and vnto whose fauour, next vnder God, I ascribe, the

greatest part of my world∣ly wel-being. I am ot to rbbe vp and open  ound of griefe, which or contrey receid; but you most of all by the death of the Right Wor∣shipfull, your deare fa∣ther.

these papers to your hands, wherein you may find something which may helpe forward your happy course towards heauen, it hath pleased God to set some of you in places of Authority, to serue  Coun∣trey, others he hath sent to serue his Prince at the Court, and you haue need both of good heads and good hearts too, that you may hold out in these high
places. If these poore me∣ditatiōs of mine may serue as Phillips boy, to put yo in mind of your mortality, which it my make you di the happier, but neuer whit the sooner; I shoul thinke my smal labor ful ly recompenced, and m maine end, which is God: glory▪ somwhat furthered, To your honorable accep∣tance therfore, I commē these short meditations, and both you and them t Gods blessing.
