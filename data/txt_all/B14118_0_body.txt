THough manie yeers since, be∣ing in Oxford but a young Student, I tooke some pri∣uate paines in the compo∣sing of Dauids Sling; and
since that time haue had small leisure to attende a∣ny further trauell in such respect: yet to shewe my thankefull minde of your Honourable fauoures to∣wardes me, I haue striuen by stealth of houres to draw this shorte prayer booke, beseeching your accepta∣tion thereof.
I haue therein deliue∣red that matter, which I trust is sound and necessa∣rie for particular person, and case: And pray God, it maie redounde to the profit of the Reader, as oc∣casion
serueth. Thus ho∣ping of your Honors coun∣tenance, I offer it as some pledge of my bounden re∣membrance, and so com∣mit you and all your cares to the Almighty. The sixt of Aprill, Anno 1601.
