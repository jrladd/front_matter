RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
AFter some vnpleasing intermissions, Ireturne to that taske of Contemplation, wherin onely my soule findeth rest. Jf in other imployments I haue indeuoured to serue God and his Church, yet in none (I must confesse) with equall con∣tentment. Me thinkes Controuersie is not right in my way to Heauen; how euer the importunitie of an Aduer∣sary may force me to fetch it in: If Truth oppressed by an erroneous Teacher cry (like a rauisht Ʋirgin) for my aid, J betray it, if J releeue it not; when J haue done, J returne gladly to these paths of Peace. The fauour which my late Polemicall labour hath
 found (beyond merit) from the Learned, cannot diuert my loue to those wrangling Studies. How earnestly doth my heart rather wish an vniuersall cessation of these Armes; that all the Profes∣sors of the deare Name of Christ might bee taken vp with no∣thing but holy and peaceable thoughts of Deuotion; the sweet∣nesse whereof hath so farre affected mee, that (if I might doe it without danger of mis-construction) I could beg euen of an Ene∣mie this leaue to bee happy. I haue already giuen account to the World, of some expences of my houres this way, and heere I bring more; which if some Reader may censure as poore, none can cen∣sure as vnprofitable. J am bold to write them vnder your Honora∣ble Name, whereto I am deeply obliged; that I may leaue behinde me this meane, but faithfull Testimony, of mine humble thankful∣nesse to your Lordship, and your most honoured and vertuous Ladie. The noble respects J haue had from you both, deserue my Prayers, and best seruices, which shall neuer be wanting to you and yours,
