Noble and Princely La∣dies,
haue made You a
Stranger to Wales for the
greatest part of your life;
yet your Marriage since,
vvith a chiefe Gentleman
of that Country, and many
Children borne there (li∣uing
partes of your selfe,
as that great Prince of Phi∣losophers
calleth them)
may vvorthily make me
repute you S. Wenefrides
Countrey-vvoman.
Your singular Deuo∣tion

besides, to that re∣novvned
Saint, and great
Patronesse of WALES▪
vvhich lately caused you
(as I haue heard) to mea∣sure,
vvith no fevv At∣tendants
of friends and
seruants about you, the
vvhole length of that
Countrey, to visit the de∣uout
& memorable Plac
of her Martyrdome, ad¦ded
to that former Res∣pect,
and a constant desire
vvithall in my selfe, to

honour, in vvhat I may,
& serue you; haue povver∣fully
preuayled, & moued
 to present this transla∣ed
Life of that glorious
VIRGIN, ABBESSE
and MARTYR, espe∣cially
vnto you.
ƲƲho as a bright mor∣ning-star
ceaseth not euen
novv, to shyne, in her
ovvne knovvne Graces,
and daily Honours done
by deuout people vnto her;
vvhen as other Stars, in

this late darkenes, ouer∣vvhelming
our Countrey,
are quite vanished out of
liuing mēs sights: I meane,
innumerable Men, and
VVomen of Wales, very
conspicuous in tymes past,
for their admired Sancti∣ty,
and honoured in Chur∣ches
dedicated particular∣ly
vnto them, are novv
vtterly forgotten, and ne∣uer
againe, as knovvne
Saints, to be honoured by
vs, vntil in glory vve shall


ly Light hath scarsly euer
beene obscured, in your
ovvne, or your Husbands
ancient Families.
A rare Happines in
these tymes, and to fevv
Houses of Noble note, so
graciously affoarded by the
Authour of all Graces,
vvhereby, their earthly
Worth, hath vvith hea∣uenly
Graces ben happily
matched; and are so emi∣nently
novv graced, by
Your ovvne particular

Vertues, as S. Wen fride
vvill gladly accepe such
a Patronesse of hert Life
printed, vvho so holily imi∣tateth
the same, as it vvas
acted by her. VVherin her
Blessed Intercession hath
already, and vvill I doubt
not, perseuerantly assiste
you, by obteyning of her
Diuine Spouse, Tempo∣rall
Blessings, and Eter∣nall
Graces, for you and
yours; vvhich I daily
vvish, and hartily pray

for, as your euer deuoted
friend, and seruant,
