Madam;
ALL the World will agree with
me, when I tell You that 'tis not
because You have any occasion
of a Discourse of this kind that I
lay these Reflections at Your Ladyship's
feet; but because You are a perfect Exam∣ple
how little need there is of an unsoci∣able
Majesty on the one hand, or a vile
Submission on the other, where Virtue and
Goodness, Noble and Generous Souls, Ten∣der
and Sublime Affections are mutually
contemplated and enjoy'd, and do for ever
banish every Thought that might begin
the least uneasiness. For if the Beauties of
Your Mind, and the perfect Agreeableness

of Your Humor, and the mighty Charms
of Your Conversation are enough to melt
the Heart of the most barbarous Man, and
soften him into a Generous Tenderness;
how great is the Happiness of You both,
when the noble Partner of Your Joys
seems made for You, and has those Great
and Endearing Qualities which do suffi∣ciently
justify the exalted Passion You have
for Him, and the Opinion every one hath
of Your Choice!
Madam,
May You thus go on, Live, Love and
be Happy, till by just degrees You pass
through all the Joys of this Life to those
Above.
