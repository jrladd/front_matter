I Do not (good Mistres
Roberts) present these
papers vnto you as either
worthy of your viewe and
grauitie, or any way an∣swerable
to the least part of your
great courtesies, but being many waies
highlie bounden, I haue sought by such
meanes (as vnable students are wonte)
to performe to you as to my good Pa∣tronesse,
some shewe of gratitude by my
pen, which I am not able to expresse in

any other meete furniture of fortune.
Accept therefore I praie you, not so
much the value which is of no worth, as
the mind of him who carieth you in all
due & reuerent estimatiō. And so besee∣ching
God to yeeld you all the effect of
your vertuous desire, I humblie take
my leaue.
