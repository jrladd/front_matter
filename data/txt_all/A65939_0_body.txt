SIR,
THE Liberty you gave me this last Summer to Angle in your great Pond at Winckhurst, emboldens me in grati∣tude to present you with this little treatise on the pleasure of Angling; the observati∣ons are my own, and some of the Pleasure I received in your good Company when An∣gling at Heaver, and since in the Company of Capt. Comer, and an other Gentleman at Winckhurst; where in one Day we caught about twenty brace of extraordinary large Carps with very sweet Eeles and Tench; I be∣lieve I shall hardly forget the Pearch of eigh∣teen Inches long, caught by Capt. Comer, nor the Old Gentlemans resolution, while we were drinking a Dram of the Bottle, a Fish
run away with his Rod, which he being un∣willing to loose, stript off his Cloaths and leapt in, and in swimming proved too nimble for the Fish, for I assure you, he brought them both out with much content to regain his Rod.
Sir, the Capt. assures me, there be larger Peareh in the Pond tho I never saw a braver, should I commend the Fish some may think I flatter, but of all the Ponds I ever Angled in, I never received so much delight in so little time, nor ever eat of sweeter or lar∣ger Carps, for all we caught that did not ex∣ceed sixteen or eighteen Inches, we turn'd into the water again, thinking it pity to kill them before they came to their full growth, which commonly exceeds twenty.
Sir, I know your Love to Fish and Angling, and how to your great cost, you have caused to be dig'd a large square Pond in your great Yard before your dwelling place at Sundridg, and storing it with brave Carps and other Fish, which Pond contains in length three hundred Foot, and two hundred and ten foot in breadth, all dug out of the side of a Hill to the depth of fourteen Foot, and wharsing it ninety foot against the Highway side, with Extraordinary good Plancks of Oak, the Trees being fell'd in your own ground that made them, and then in the mid∣dle
of the Pond a most delightful Summer House to go to by Boat, twelve foot long and ten foot broad, with a Fountain in the middle, where the water plays in sundry Figures; besides the Rails and Ballisters that compass it round, there's a Platform of lead on the top, with Rails and Ballisters to walk and Angle upon.
But that which gives the greater grace, in my Opinion, is the Summer House standing upon a Fish House, which beside the Fish there kept, is stored all round with Nests for Ducks, where they breed in abundance, and under the Eves of the uppermost Platform, there is an Ingenious contrivance for Coves, wherein the Pidgeons encrease extraordina∣ry; It's no easy matter for a Simon Suck-egg to Rob either of their Nests, unless he'll ad∣venture at one time both Drowning and Hanging: 'Tis very pleasant walking round the Pond, where a Man hath six or seven foot of Earth over his head on the one side for a shelter, while the other side defends him from the water by a shade of Osiers.
I have also seen your round Fountain in your delightful best Garden, and the stock of Fish therein kept to be always at hand to pleasure your Friends, which is continually stored with Trouts and Carps of the largest size; I remember also the Oval Fountain in
the Kitchen Garden, which is a good Nurse∣ry for the younger fry, but above all, I ad∣mire at your Ingenuity in contriving that Square Pond on the top of your House, which contains good Carps and other Fish, and is an excellent divertisement when you are pleased to disport your self and friends with your fine Water Works, I admired once how the water ascended to that Height, to be always full of sweet and fresh water, till you were pleased to shew me how you perform'd it by the help of an Engine.
If there be delights any where, I think you have them all at home, for a Man to see Fish swimming on the top of your House and the Fowls of Heaven to live and breed under the water, will be strange to those whose faith is too weak to believe, or capacity to understand your Ingenuity, how you have made Coves for Pidgeons under the Pond where they breed, that a Man may justly say, that only Lead keeps the two Elements a∣sunder.
Sir, you know that what I write is truth, I would not have People think I equivocate when I tell them without Romancing, how that Pond on the Houses top serves not only to keep Fish, but also to play your fine Water Works, both in your Celler and in the round Fountain in your best Garden, but also
in the Ovall Fountain in the fore Court, where the water rises twenty foot Perpen∣dicular; neither must I forget the same wa∣ter runing through several Meanders, Plays also in the Summer House that stands in the great Pond.
Sir, as you have to my thinking all the pleasure the Water and the Air can afford you at home, so I know you can have abun∣dance more when you are pleased to di∣vert your self at Bore-place, and injoy the Pleasure of the great Pond at Winckhurst, either in the Summer time with your An∣gle, or in the Winter with your Gun in your Boat, when the wild Ducks and other Fowl resort thither in great Num∣bers, few Ponds being of that extent as to cover twenty Acres, which it is most commonly in the VVinter; beside your other Pond call'd Baillies, which general∣ly covers twelve Acres of ground, as also the lower Pond that contains six Acres and feeds two Mills to grind Corn, these Ponds being extreamly well stored with Fish and Wild Fowl in Winter, renders your Injoyments beyond expecta∣tion.
I could sum up more delights attend you, as your Pretty Warren for Coneys closed in with a substantial strong stone Wall,
did I think, I could escape the censure of flattery of which I was never Guilty, and since I have been partaker of most of them in your Company, and hope still with your Permision to injoy them, I do with true thankfulness subscribe my self,
SIR,
