THings deferred, and long in expectation, afford the more ioy in the fruition. You haue (I acknowledge
 most deare and louing Mother) hi∣therto reaped nothing at all, for all that you haue so largely and long since sowne: but haue with the wise Hus∣bandman, still patiently waited for the fruitfull time of Haruest.
Now therefore, in some measure to comfort you, (though at the last) as our Sauiour willeth his Disciples, so doe I you, To lift vp your eyes, for now the Regions are already Albae white, euen to the Haruest. Ioh. 4. 35. And although they bee not all Siccae, dry, and throughly ripe at once▪ yet let our small beginning bee acceptable, and encourage you with hope of the rest in due time. All Graines are not ripe together, but euery kinde hath it owne proper, and
 fit season. Heere first we beginne with Faith, and purpose (God blessing vs) to goe on with Hope, and end with Loue, which threefold Cable shall neuer bee broken. I could finde none in right (amongst the ma∣ny more fit then your selfe, to whose care and protection I might commit this shiftlesse and helplesse Orphan: it beeing originally, and properly your own Issue. If there∣fore you shall bee pleased with these my first fruites, and fauourably in∣terpret these my first endeauours: you shall thereby encourage mee to tender to your view, workes of grea∣ter importance heereafter. And in the interim (as duty bindeth mee) I will not cease to solicite God by
 prayer for your continuall prosperity; and that when hee shall please to take you from this earthly mansion, you may ascend into the euerlasting habitation of glorie. And thus in all filiall obsequy I humbly take my leaue this third of Ian. 1617.
