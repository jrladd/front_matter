THe good turne and great labour good Madam, your Honorable husband be∣stowed in my behalf bindes me so far, as I must not be ingrat, to him nor non of his, & chiefelie to remember your Ladishippe, with some matter accep∣table, I than thinking of the great griefe that manie Sol∣diours found by the absence of the Queenes Maiestie in time of the plague, when she laie last at Hampton court, drew out some sadde verses of the sorrowe among Sol∣diers conceiued, and presuming you will accept them, I became so bolde as to present them to your handes, had I anie worthier worke to offer I would bring better, but hoping these fewe lines shall duetifullie show my good will, I am to craue your fauour, in presenting these ver∣ses vnto you, desiring God to multiplie his benefites and blessinges in your good Ladishippe.
