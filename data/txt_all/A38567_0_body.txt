AS I was coming, a while since, out of Italy, for England, that I might not waste all that time I was to sit on Horsback, in foolish and illiterate Fables, I chose ra∣ther, one while to revolve with my self, something of our common Studies, and other while, to enjoy the remembrance of my Friends, of whom, I left here, some no lesse learned, than pleasant; Amongst these, you, my More, came first in my mind, whose memory, though absent your self, gives me such de∣light in my absence, as when present with you, I ever found in your company; than which, let me
perish, if in all my life, I ever met with any thing more delectable: And therefore, being satisfy'd that something was to be done, and that, that time was no wise proper for any serious matter, I resolv'd to make some sport with The Praise of Folly: But who the Devil put that in thy head? you'l say; The first thing, was your sirname, of More, which comes so near the word Moriae (Folly) as you are far from the thing; And that you are so, all the world will clear you: In the next place, I conceiv'd this exercise of wit, would not be least approv'd by you, inasmuch as you are wont to be delighted with such kind of mirth, that is to say, neither unlearn∣ed, if I am not mistaken, nor altogether insipid, and in the whole course of your life, have play'd the part of a Democritus: And though, such is the excellence of your Judgement, that 'twas ever con∣trary to that of the peoples, yet such is your incredi∣ble affability, and sweetness of temper, that you both can, and delight to carry your self to all men, a man of all hours: Wherefore, you will not only, with good will accept this small Declamation, but take upon you the defence of 't, forasmuch, as being de∣dicated to you, it is now no longer mine, but yours: But perhaps, there will not be wanting some wran∣glers, that may cavil, and charge me, partly, that these toyes are lighter than may became a Divine, and partly, more biting, than may beseem the mode∣sty of a Christian, and consequently exclaim, that
I resemble the Ancient Comedy, or another Lucian, and snarle at every thing: But I would have them, whom the lightness, or foolery of the Argument may offend, to consider, that mine is not the first of this kind, but the same thing, that has been often pra∣ctis'd even by great Authors; when Homer, so ma∣ny Ages since, did the like with the battel of Frogs and Mice; Virgil, with the Gnat, and Puddings; Ovid, with the Nut; When Polycrates, and his Corrector Isocrates, extor'd Tyranny; Glauco, Injustice; Favorinus, Deformity, and the quar∣tan Ague; Synescius, Baldness; Lucian, the Fly, and Flattery: When Seneca made such sport with Claudius's Canonizations; Plutarch, with his Dialogue between Ulysses and Gryllus; Lucian and Apuleius, with the Asse; and some other, I know not who, with the Hog that made his lost Will and Testament, of which also, even S. Jerome makes mention: And therefore if they please, let 'em sup∣pose I play'd at Tables for my diversion, or if they had rather have it so, that I red on a Hobby-horse: for what injustice is it, that when we allow every course of life its Recreation, that Study only, should have none especially, when such toyes, are not with∣out their serious matter, and foolery is so handled, that the Reader that is not altogether thick-skull'd, may reap more benefit from 't, than from some mens crabbish, and specious Arguments? As when one, with long study, and great pains, patches many pieces
together, on the praise of Rhetorick, or Philosophy; another, makes a Panegyrick to a Prince; another, encourages him to a War against the Turks; ano∣ther, tells you what will become of the world, after himself is dead; and another, finds out some new device for the better ordering of Goats-wooll: for as nothing is more trifling than to treat of serious matters triflingly; so nothing carries a better grace, than so to discourse of trifles, as a man may seem to have intended them least: For my own part, Let other men judge of what I have written; though yet, unlesse an overweening opinion of my self, may have made me blind in my own cause, I have prais'd Folly, but not altogether foolishly: And now, to say somewhat, to that other cavil, of biting; this liberty was ever permitted to all mens wits, to make their smart witty reflections on the common errors of mankind, and that too, without offence, as long as this liberty does not run into licentiousness; which makes me the more admire the tender ears, of the men of this age, that can away with solemn Titles, Nay, you'l meet with some, so preposterously religi∣ous, that they will sooner endure the broadest scoffs, even against Christ himself, than hear the Pope or a Prince be toucht in the least, especially, if it be any thing that concerns their profit; whereas he that so taxes the lives of men, without naming any one in particular, whither I pray, may he be said to bite, or rather to teach, and admonish? or other∣wise,
I beseech ye, under how many notions do I tax my self? Besides, he that spares no sort of men, cannot be said to be angry, with any one in particu∣lar, but the vices of all; And therefore, if there shall happen to be any one, that shall say he is hit, he will but discover, either his guilt or fear: Saint Jerome sported in this kind with more freedome, and greater sharpnesse, not sparing sometimes, mens very name. But I, besides that I have wholly a∣voided it, I have so moderated my stile, that the un∣derstanding Reader, will easily perceive, my endea∣vours herein, were rather to make mirth, than bite: Nor have I, after the Example of Juvenal, raked up that forgotten sink of filth and ribaldry, but laid before you, things, rather ridiculous, than dis∣honest: And now, if there be any one, that is yet dis∣satisfied, let him at least remember, that it is no dis∣honour, to be discommended by Folly; and having brought her in, speaking, it was but fit, that I kept up the character of the person. But why do I run over these things to you, a person so excellent an Advocate, that no man better defends his Client, though the cause many times, be none of the best? Farewell, my lest disputant More, and stoutly de∣fend your Moriae.
From the Country, the 5th. of the Ides of June.
