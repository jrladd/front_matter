SIr, having finished this treatise, I consi∣dered what entertainment it might find in the world; and fearing that it would be envied, for the good that it offereth unto this Kingdome, as I the Author have been for my practice, I bethought my selfe that it might safely hover under your wings, whereupon I am bold to thrust it into your protection, that it may the better be defended from the calumnies of these times. The Subject of it is, that which I have practised and proved by Experience, so that if there bee occasion, I believe I shall bee able to render sufficient reasons to prove it, from the most Authentique rules in Physick. And if there

be any errors escaped in it, I shall rather desire that they may be corrected by the discretiō of you or any of the Colledg of Physicians, then disputed upon by new beginners in the practice of Physick, who have but small experience. As for those Medicines published at the latter end of this booke, I shall not desire your protection for them, because I never made you, nor any man acquainted with them, For I intended that they should be Protectors for themselves: but however I hope that my endeavours in this small treatise will not be unpleasant, but acceptable to you, for the good which I believe it will do in the World; and so for this time I rest in some measure of assurance of your worships favour.
