MY LORD,
YOUR Lordship's Deportment, during the whole time of Your Administration, has so fully illustrated my Argument, that the affixing Your Name to the Discourse is no more than the joining a most eminent Example to the Apostles Rule; and I am apt to think that a just Character of Your Lord∣ship (durst I have attempted the forming it with any hopes of coming up to it) would have afforded a far clearer Description of the Virtue enjoined in my Text, than the best Notion and Idea of it which I have been able to conceive and describe. That Steadiness of
Temper, which is so conspicuous in Your Lordship, seems to argue You to have been made on purpose for such a Stormy Year, as this has been, in which You have sate at the Helm; and the Moderation which You have with so good effect exercised in a most difficult and Critical Juncture, and amidst the highest Insolencis and Provocations of a Daring and Intemperate Faction, has not only gain'd You the Hearty Affection and Esteem of all Wise and Good Men at present, but a vast Fund of Honour and Renown reserv'd for History, which remotest Posterity will not be able to exhaust. That Al∣mighty God would plentifully reward Your Lordship, and grant that Your Successors may be equally suc∣cessful in their Endeavourss for the Peace and Wel∣fare of this City, is the Prayer of,
MY LORD,
