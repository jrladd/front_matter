May it please your Excellency,
IF the Lord were as forgetfull of our Obligations as we are, or if he did remember our sins no bet∣ter than we do remember duties: or if our un∣sensiblenesse of our iniquities were the cure of our maladies; or if there were any security to our souls in our security, in our transgressions; I might expect with some justice to be censured, as troublesome and impertinent, in going about to revive these Oathes, that have lain so long for dead in these Na∣tions; and have been for so many years buried in the grave of Oblivion; or to amaze or disquiet the Nation with the noise and the clamour of them: but when I have considered how dangerous it is for peo∣ple to sleep by the Devils Opium, and how much better it is, that a people should be troubled, than that they should be destroyed; and that they should be desturbed out of their most pleasant slumbers and dreams, than that they should enjoy their quiet with the dreadfull flames of Gods wrath and indignation, menaced against a perjured People about their ears,
ready to seize upon them, both to their temporal and eternal destruction. I cannot but conclude it to be much safer for them, and much more tolerable unto them, to be awaked to Repentance, by the voice of these Oathes, and by the discovery of the Obliga∣tion, that thereby lyes upon this Nation; and of the grievous sins that have been committed, and are still too much justified against them, than that they should be awaked by the surprizal of that dreadfull judgment of God, which hangs over them for such high transgressions. The law of Oathes, is one of the most awfull, and most inviolable precepts that God hath given to the world, and may seem to have as much of the fire of Mount Sinah in it, as any com∣mandement of either Table. The second Comman∣dement hath indeed a dreadfull stream and floud of flaming wrath running down upon the transgressors of it, from generation to generation; but it is allay∣ed as it were, with a flood of mercy, unto those that love the Lord, and shew their love in obedience thereunto.
The fifth Commandment, which is the Command of obedience unto those powers, that God hath set over us in the world, which is the importance of these Oathes, is the first Commandment, with pro∣mise, and sweetned with the assurance of Gods bles∣sing, upon those that shall perform their duties there∣unto. But the third Commandement is fortified with a wall of fire; wherein God threatneth not to hold them guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine. The offence whereof, is most grievously committed in the dreadfull and hainous sins of perjury, which is
the mark of that flying rowle and curse, that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth, to consume those that offend therein, Zech. 5.2, 3, 4. in so much (that as Wonarinus observeth, out of the Book of the Jews, concerning the regative Precept) they were wont to terrifie those that were to take an Oath with these expressions, Scito totum orbem horruisse in illâ horâ in quâ Deus dixit non assumes nomen Dei in vanum, &c. Know thou that the whol world trembled at the hour wherein God said, Thou shalt not take the Name of God in vain: and all the sins which are written in the law, God punisheth according to the merit: But for this sin of perjury, he punisheth posterity; the punishments of others sins are somtimes suspended, but this is spee∣dily punished. Perjury consumeth and destroyeth even those things which fire cannot consume: Since therefore there is so much danger in the sins com∣mitted against these Oathes; exposing not onely to the judgement of the second Commandment, as they are the most horrid sort of sins against that, and to the forfeiture of the blessing of the fifth Commandment, as they are sinnes of disobedience against that Com∣mandment; it can be no way safe for the people of this land, to be suffered to sleep in such grievous sins: I hope therefore, there needs no further Apology to secure me from the just displeasure of any, for that I have endeavoured to rouse up the people of this Land, by the publishing of these Oathes, to a deep sense of the great and hainous sins that they lye un∣der, by the violation of these Oathes, and to a return unto those duties that they require of them: What I have done in the Explication of them, and in the
Observations upon them, is in order to the discove∣ring of the meaning and force of them; wherein I intend not to impose upon the judgement of any, but desire they may be received according to the evidence wherewith they are offered; which I hope will appear to be sufficient, to engage unto Repen∣tance for these evill practises, that have been acted in these Nations, and are yet still on foot against these sacred Obligations, and to better performances to the future; and to excite your Excellency, whom God hath raised up to be an instrument of his glory, and of mercy unto these Nations; to give your countenance to this my loyall and religious endea∣vour, and your assistance to the desired effect there∣of: Which will be a means not onely to encrease your Honour amongst men; but to bring more and more blessings from God, upon you and your Poste∣rity; by the gracious work that you shall do by de∣livering this Nation from so great a Sin, and from so great a Wrath that hangs over them for it: which is the earnest desire of him, who desires to approve himself,
