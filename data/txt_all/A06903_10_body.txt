AS oft a I beholde that poore house from whence I am descended, so oft I beholde vndying monu∣ments of the noble and gracious fauours which by your famous Grandfather and most renow∣ned Father, were plentiously powred vpon our familie, so that whilst the glew of Lime and Simant shal knit stones together, so long in our house wil be held their memo∣ries. from these motiues (most excellent Lord) and from the loue I see you beare to this Arte which I professe, I am im∣boldned to offer to your noble handes, the view of these my la∣bours, in which, how soeuer my Arte may be controlled, yet it shall vnder the deffence of your countenance iustifie it selfe both by the groundes of experience and reason, and though my obscuritie liue vnaccompained with popular opinion, yet yet when I shall be tride, I hope I shall proue vnsopbisticat, and the rather sith my nature hath euer loathed to bee adorned with false fiers; yet that I am the meanest of many I know, & my selfe am vnto my selfe a testimonie, and that I desire no greater height mine Inambiton hath proued, onely your honors good opinion shall be the ayme of my longings, and that gained, I shall die your honors humbly deuoted.
