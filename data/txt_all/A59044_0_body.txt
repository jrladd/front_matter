YOur offence and anger, begot this Treatise: And therefore it is yours; in∣tended for you: Not only to remove the of∣fence, but to instruct you, into a way of peace and love: Your anger was the Father of it; but love conceived it, and is its Mother: It be∣ing begotten of anger and love, you may well expect both natures in it: And must receive them both together,
for they cannot be separated. Severity and kindness, are one in their Original and End: They meet, in the present Providence of God upon you: They are bound up together in this little vo∣lume: If your minds be as large as it, or in any measure, suitable to your present condition, you will easily com∣prehend and digest both: If you can∣not agree with some sharpness; you will neither agree with your selves, nor with God: For you have been, and are so, to others; and God is now so to you.
I write both against and for all: Against and for my self: Against and for you: And against and for your ad∣versaries: Because there is some good, and evil in all: My quarrel is only at malice, which makes all the quarrels in the earth: And at that, because it de∣stroyes: If I meet with any, in that way of enmity and destruction, I do not forbear them: You will, I hope, find in the reading of it, that the root
and spring of it is love; the design of it, in all the parts of it, is to unite di∣vided Parties; and the conclusion is peace.
I would gladly that you should have the honour, of being the first movers in, and seekers of peace: Your Pro∣fession of the Gospel and Kingdom of peace, should incline you to it: You have proved war, and it at last fails you: Your present sufferings press you, to meekness and patience: It is to me evident, and in this Book, I think de∣monstrated; that those good things you expected by war, you can obtain and inherit, only by love and peace, and in the good spirit of Jesus: And there∣fore I have endeavoured to search the roots of your state and standing in en∣mity, as deeply as I can: that they be∣ing slain, you may be free, to go forth from your present captivity, into largeness: and so into peace and deli∣verance.
There are two things which I suspect
may deny you the benefit of what I have written.
First, I doubt the things here writ∣ten, may not, at least not in all parts, be fully and clearly understood: Be∣cause my mind having long travelled, in the pursuit of the reason and principles of things, lies at some distance, from mens ordinary apprehensions of things; and therefore may not be so readily conceived: I am sensible also, that by reason of my long retirement, there is a cloud upon my spirit, that I cannot yet come forth, with that evidence, that I would, and I believe shall: I know likewise, that mens understand∣ings, live much abroad, in outward things, and are little conversant with the inward reason and spirit of things: And that at this time, your minds are like troubled waters, disturbed and not clear.
To remedy these defects, both in your selves and me, let me prevail with you, to read this small Treatise, with a
little more then ordinary diligence and consideration.
I am sensible of the obscurity of the former Book, which made it so liable to mistakes: And have endeavoured all plainness here, even to coursness, and have taken liberty, rather to write the same things again, then to be too short: Yet I doubt some parts of it may be vail'd to thee: If thou meet with any places that are so; Possibly the greatest treasure of truth may lie hid there: True wisdom yet lies deep, and is hardly found, hardly expressed, and hardly understood: If thou wilt dig for her, by a little study, she will reward thy pains: If therefore there be a curtain drawn, before any part, do but rouse up thy reason, and press in upon it, you may have admittance, by a little consideration and labour.
My second doubt is, lest you meet∣ing with something, that may cross your opinion of your selves and way; you should turn away from the justice
and truth of reproof: But consider, if you will hear nothing against you, you can never come to know your faults: If you will receive nothing, but what agrees with your present ap∣prehensions, you must resolve never to be wiser: If thou meetest with a strange, different, or opposite notion to thine own, consider; it is either true, or false: If it be true, then it is a danger∣ous thing for thy soul, to refuse a truth, and embrace a lie: For no man can be happy but in truth: If it be false, do but throughly examine it, and thou wilt find the falshood of it; and then it will be a great confirmation and en∣largement to truth in thy mind: Therefore turn not from it, nor reject it; but rather search it and subdue it: For no lie can long stand out, against a true mind: If an errour have gotten some shew of reason, or truth, to cover it; if it be, by a just mind searched and tried; that reason and truth, will come over, to that just mind, and leave
the lie naked and destitute; such con∣quests are very much to the advantage of truth: The experience I have of this thing, makes me love the exercise of opposition; and to delight to read, above all things, those that are con∣trary to my judgement: For I con∣stantly find, that things said and done against the truth, do as our Lord pro∣mised his Disciples: It shall turn unto you for a testimony.
I know and feel that sore travel is upon you; pangs have taken hold of you: It is, that you may be born again, into a new state and life, more holy, large, merciful, and heavenly, then that wherein you have lived and acted: It is that, I labour with you for, in this Treatise: If you could once come to understand this design of God, in his present afflicting of you: That it is not to upbraid, much less to destroy, the Party or your persons, for your or others personal sins; no, he pitties and forgives: But it is that carnal and cor∣rupt state, of war, enmity, and de∣stroying,
that is accursed of God: If you could but discern this; and turn▪ away from that fleshly, corrupted, and now perished state; you would quick∣ly find ease, rest and safety for your souls; and escape much of the guilt and curse that yet sorely afflicts you: It is the intent of this Treatise, to bring you off from that; and to shew you a more excellent way. Your former ministry is finished, that state is perish∣ed; you must have a new one: Read diligently, and you will find, here is an entrance into that, which will not fail.
I know the prejudices you have a∣gainst me; I know that there is weak∣ness in what I write; both may disad∣vantage my work: I leave it to the Lord of all hearts and spirits: The things I have written, are I think just; and it is just I should publish them▪ The Law of love and truth, in my mind, led me to it, and upheld me in it; and there∣fore I am satisfied in my self: And in the righteousness truth, and faithful∣ness of God, in whom I live and rest,
