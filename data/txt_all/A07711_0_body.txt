SIR,
 Have found you so Noble in the first De∣dication, that I should much derogate from your true Worth, and wrong my selfe to make choise of a new Pa∣tron

for the second (exactly done with applause) wherein though I presume, yet persume, t'will bee no sinne to multiply my ob∣ligation. Your name, and nature, claimes, and deserves it, 'tis your due and my duty, and were I able to expresse more MOORE should have it, for I must al∣wayes acknowledge your good∣nesse in whatsoever quality for tune shall bestow me. SIR, I know you are wise. In a word I am, really what I am.
