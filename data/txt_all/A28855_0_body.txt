My Lord,
THESE Notes were taken in your Lord∣ships Garison, and threatned to be brought before you, in case I would not promise they
should be forth-coming, and en∣gage for their appearance. I did so, and I here humbly present them for their trial. If upon their ex∣amination your Lordship shall find them guilty of any thing like He∣terodox, or Disloyal: let them be committed to Ʋulcan, who allows papers no Bail; But if their inte∣grity shall appear, I humbly beg your Lordships pass, that they may go abroad under your hono∣rable name. For now every one is talking of their preferments, I would gladly the world should know mine, which is to be,
My Lord,
