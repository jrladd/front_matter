THese following Vowes and Acclamations wherewith Your Father (the best of Kings) was received at his Return from Scotland) I dedicate not unadvisedly to Your Highness: that when you shall be seasoned with Erudition (now your Ornament from many Ancestors) you may draw from this (whatever) small memorial, a Treasure more glorious then a triple Diaâˆ£dem, namely, AN HEREDITARY IMAGE OF VERTUE.
