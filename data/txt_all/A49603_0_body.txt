SIR,
WHEN on the one hand I con∣sider the incessant diligence used by WITS, pretended or real, in glutting our Nation with the froth and vanity of outlandish Novels, Roman∣ces, and other impertinences, tending rather to deprave the Natives, than to implant in them the Seeds of Virtue and true Gallantry; and on the other hand, how few there are who employ themselves in seeking out the lit∣tle Gold which lies hid under their great heaps of Dross and Rubbidge: I thought my self indispensably obliged to adhere to the
Council of the famous Moralist, who said, Stultissimum credo ad imitandum non op∣tima quaeque proponere.
Therefore passing by the polite and dis∣guised Writings of an Arnaud, a Friar Mimbourg, a Symon, and the like Ambo∣dexters of the times, who in vain rack their Invention to please two Masters at once, halt∣ing betwixt God and Baal, their Duty and Obedience unto their King, and Allegiance to the Bishop of Rome, following the steps of a S. Becket, they may in time receive his Re∣ward: I say, not medling with such conta∣gious Works and Writings, I have essayed to communicate to the Publick, something which may tend as well to the Profit as the Pleasure of the Reader. Also remembring how ac∣ceptable the Labours of the admirable Du Bartas were in this Climate, both at Court, and also in the City and Country; and looking round the many Writers of the Age, I have singled out his Neighbour and Countryman, the venerable Monsieur L'ARROQUE, of whom it may be said, in the words of our Saviour, (if Metaphysical Dissertations are
preferrable before Natural) That a greater than Du Bartas is here: For he sang but the Works of the Six Days Creation, which shall be destroyed and burnt up; but our Author takes a higher flight, and as well from the Records of Heaven, as from the Registers of the soundest Antiquity, displays unto us the excellency of that august Sacrament, instituted by our Lord himself, and which is to be com∣memorated in the Church, unto the end of time, that thereby we may be translated into the new Jerusalem, there to be everlastingly fed and refreshed with the Fruit of the Tree of Life. As an Angel was set at the En∣trance into the Garden of Eden, with a fla∣ming Sword; so here Entrance is denied un∣to the prophane Rout, but free Admission pro∣claimed unto all that are sincere, and endea∣vour to be so, even from the frozen Lapland∣er unto the scorched Ethiopian, and from the Christians of Malabar, unto those of Mexico.
I cannot omit informing your Honour, that not many years past, with my eyes I beheld the venerable Author of the following Treatise,
weeping and praying in his Church at Vitry, for its preservation, then in danger of being suppressed and demolished by restless Enemies, who effected their wicked design soon after; and 'tis supposed, with the greater facility, by reason of the Coldness and Apostasy of the Lord Proprietor of the place, whose Honour and Glory was, about the same time, laid in the Dust with the Ruines of that stately Edi∣fice. I say, I beheld the Author, much I sup∣pose after the same posture Alexander and Paulinus, Bishops of Constantinople and Tyre, were in, when the violent persecutions of the cruel Donatists so far prevailed, as to destroy those sumptuous Fabricks, set apart in those Cities for God's true Worship and Ser∣vice; and which was doubtless, in effect, the same doleful condition which our pious Bishops and Martyrs, the Famous Cranmer, Lati∣mer, Ridley, &c. were involved in, when the Flood-Gates of Romish Persecution had overflowed the Land.
I have observed, That Divines (the more to affect us with the greatness of God's Mercy, in continuing the purity of his Word and Sa∣craments
amongst us) many times look back upon the sometime flourishing estate of those happy Souls, who lived under the conduct of their Godly Pastors, in the famous Churches of Ephesus, Smyrna, Sardis, &c. wherein, with pure and undaunted zeal, they sang the Praises of their Glorified Saviour; until, by degrees, the rage of Heathen Enemies, either demolished their Churches and Temples, or, which is worse, introduced Idolatrous and Su∣perstitious Worship into them. We need not now travel so far as Asia nor Greece for In∣stances to inhaunse our due resentments of God's Benefits, on the one hand; nor to work in us a detestation of the Rage and Cruelty of the E∣nemies of his Church and People, on the other: our neighbour Nation affords us too fresh and lively a Scene of the sad Catastrophe which happened unto the Primitive Churches, that I had much rather cover with a Vail, than go about to expose unto publick view, did not the present occasion invite me to say something re∣lating thereunto.
All the World knows with what great Ad∣vice and Solemnity the Edict of Nantes was
agreed upon and confirmed by the great King Henry the Fourth, for setling and assuring the Peace and Safety of the Protestant Churches and Subjects of France. The same Edict was renew'd and confirm'd by his Son Lewis the Thirteenth, and all the great Officers of his Kingdom, but how well kept, the forcing Rochel, &c. may testifie.
At the Coronation of the present King Lewis the Fourteenth, it was again amply confirm'd by him, as it had been before by his Father and Grandfather, and as solemnly sworn unto as the Pyrenaean Treaty, so that e∣very body concluded the Protestants of France would not have been molested nor injur'd in his Reign; and yet it is in his time found by sad experience, that they have been most of all oppressed and persecuted, and that without a∣ny pretence of taxing them of ingaging in the Projects of a Queen-mother, or Prince of Conde: but all Civil Dissentions being past over and pacified, within the compass of these last twenty years, wherein they desired only to live peaceably, under the protection of the Laws and publick Faith, contrary thereunto,
the insatiable rage of wicked Men hath de∣prived them of their Commands, Offices, and Employments, and the liberty of executing them, in Civil as well as Military Affairs; whereby many thousands had starved, had they not found support and sanctuary under the Wings of our great Defender of the true Faith. And whereas, by the Laws of the Land, there was no difference to be made be∣twixt Protestant and Popish Subjects, for en∣joying and executing all manner of Trades, and places of trust, the quite contrary hath been practis'd: the Courts of Judicature, wherein was an equal number of Counsellors and Judges of both Religions, for hearing and determining differences, have been suppress'd and quite alter'd; Attorneys, Apothecaries, Chirurgeons, and generally all other mecha∣nick and handycraft Trades, not permittedto gain or eat their bread in quiet. But which is most doleful of all to consider, the Ministers of the Gospel are forbidden to preach the word of God, many of them slain, imprisoned, and banished, their Churches pull'd down to the ground, and their flock dispers'd over the face
of the Earth, into England, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Germany, &c. as Sheep having no Shepherd, just as it happened unto their Pre∣decessors, the Albigenses and Waldenses, for the same cause, above Five hundred Years ago; and the few that remain in the Land of their Nativity, waiting for the time that their King and Sovereign, like an other Cy∣rus, or Charlemain, his Royal and Religious Ancestor, will give and proclaim deliverance unto the dispersed Tribes, from their cruel Bondage, and from so great a Famine of the Word: for at present they many times see their young Infants yield up their innocent Souls, in carrying them unto places far distant, to receive the Seal of the Covenant of Bap∣tism; others yielding up their Spirits with∣out the Benefit or Help of their Spiritual Guide's consolation at the hour of Death; be∣sides many other great Miseries which they daily suffer in Body, Soul, and Estate: So that the Parisian Maacssre was a kindness, being compared with the present usage which the Protestants of France do receive by the dili∣gence of Romish Emissaries, and from their
own unkind Countrymen; for that gave them a speedy deliverance from all miseries, where∣as they are now, as it were, held on the Rack, and made suffer a thousand Deaths, before they are freed from the Burden of one mise∣rable Life.
When our Neighbours and Brethrens Houses are burning, and all in a Flame, for the same common Faith and Reformation, all Christians that have any sense of Religion and Piety, have great reason to unite their Prayers unto the God of Heaven, That he would be pleased to avert his just Judg∣ments from falling upon us for our great Impieties, and preserve our Church and Nation from the sad calamities which have ruined so many Christian Families in France, &c. and which threaten the like usage unto the rest of the Reformed World.
I own, it is the singular Blessing of God, and by the Liberality of the great Encoura∣ger of Virtue and Learning, his Grace the Lord Primate and Chancellor of Ireland, that I am happy this day in addressing my
self unto you, almost in the Words of S. Paul unto Felix, the Roman Governour, in adven∣turing to speak the more freely in this mat∣ter, because you have been for many years a Righteous Judge unto this Nation, living so that Envy it self dares not whisper the least Corruption or sign of fear or favour to Friends or Enemies, and are perfectly sensible of the verity of these things, which I have only hint∣ed at, to avoid Prolixity, lest I may be thought to write a Book of Martyrs, rather than an Epistle Dedicatory.
Our Gentry and Gallants formerly were wont, in great numbers, to flock and resort un∣to Montpellier, Montauban, Bergerac, &c. where they freely exchanged their English Gold for the Nourishment and Recreations they there found, both for Body and Soul. But now it may too truly be said of those places in particular, and of other whole Pro∣vinces in general, That the Ark of God, their Glory, is departed from them: and they, as the Asiatick Churches, are over-spread with thick and dark Clouds of Profaneness, Atheism, Ignorance, and Superstition; so that
those who travel that way, may justly fear it will be to their damage both in Body and Soul. What was the pleasant and beau∣tiful Jerusalem, when the Christians were sent out of it unto Pella, and other places? And what is France, but an Aceldama, now that the Protestants are expell'd, con∣trary to the proceedings of the wise and va∣liant Dealings of Lewis the Twelfth, who before he would ruine his Subjects for Re∣ligion, sent Commissaries, and not Dragoons, into the several parts of his Dominions, to be justly informed of the truth of matters, who, upon the Report made unto him by his Commissaries, swore a great Oath in pre∣sence of his Officers and Counsellors of State, That the Protestants were the best Subjects he had in his Kingdom, and thenceforward commanded that they should not be molested in Body or Estate. And it is well known that the present King has much better know∣ledge and experience of his Protestant Sub∣jects Loyalty, than that great Prince had occasion to know: so that it is hoped the sinister Councils of a Plotting Jesuitical Fa∣ction
will not always prevail, to the Ru∣ine of so many faithful good Subjects, and of so flourishing a Kingdom.
I have presumed here to present unto you an Epitome of the chiefest revolutions which have occurred upon this tremendous Arti∣cle of Christian Religion, in the Eastern and Western Churches, from the Apostles days unto the last Age, wherein the truth of the chiefest matters negotiated by Em∣perors, Kings, Councils, Popes, Prelates, and the eminentest Doctors of the Church, in the several Centuries, are retrieved, and recited with as great integrity and mo∣deration aspossible can be.
I have endeavoured to accommodate my self unto the Author's sense and terms, as near as I could; and if any passage seems to vary from the Doctrine of the Church of England, (which I do not observe through the whole Book) I hope to find a favoura∣ble Censure, being only a Translator and not the Author. If the Work be duely weigh∣ed, it will not stand in need of much recom∣mendation for the buying and reading of it:
such generous WINE needs no Bush; all is Loyal and Orthodox here; it recom∣mends it self unto all sorts of Persons that desire to see the weightiest matters of Re∣ligion interwoven with the pleasant light and truth of the purest History of all Ages, whereby Faith, as well as Mens Reason, is improved and confirmed, to the eternal silencing of that common question of the Gentlemen of the Roman Persuasion unto Protestants, in asking, Where their Reli∣gion was before Luther and Calvin? Here are Depths where Elephants may swim, the learned and curious may find sweetness and satisfaction; also the weakest Lamb, the pious and devout Soul, may wade with∣out fear, and go away plung'd and pleas'd in pleasure and delight. And how could I better expose this Sacred Treasure of Ec∣clesiastical Antiquity, unto publick view, than by recommending my weak endeavours herein unto your favourable acceptance and Patronage, having received the first design of coming to light near the famous Mansion of your worthy Progenitors, where for seve∣ral
years I spent some of the pleasantest days of all my life; wherein I freely confess, as God's Glory and the good of his Church was chiefly designed by me in the main, so also I thought fit to express my Gratitude unto the great Family of the Windhams in particu∣lar, a Family known to be truly Noble and Great in the number of its flourishing Branch∣es, as well as in Riches, Honour, and appro∣ved Loyalty unto their King and Country; the true happiness and lasting prosperity where∣of, shall ever be sincerely wished and desired by,
Honoured Sir,
