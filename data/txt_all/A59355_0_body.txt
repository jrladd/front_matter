My Lord,
BEfore I congratulate Your Lordship's happy In∣auguration
to the Pretorial Dignity, I must
first pay my duteous Veneration to the Merit
that advanced You thither. Your Lordship had that
Remarkable Triumph in Your Election, that when
You stood Candidate for the Chair, You brought so
fair a Mass of Virtues to intitule You to that Pretenti∣on,
that instead of Doubts and Scrutinyes, the tedious
Disputes and Jars of Voices and Parties, too common
in too many Elections, 'twas enough for such Merit
as Sir Thomas Lane's only to enter the Lifts and carry
the Conquest. Divided Favours were utterly Stran∣gers
there. Your Lordship was that universal Darling
that less than an hour began and concluded the
Choice; insomuch that there wanted no more to fix
Your Lordship's Wreath of Honour, then only to pre∣sent
the Brow that wears it.

And as Magistracy, especially in so high a Station,
as Your Lordship's, is no less then the immediate
Lievtenancy of Majesty, the Deputy and Represen∣tative
of Soveraign Power, Your Lordship makes
Your Entry to that Honorable Post of Trust with
all those eminent Advantages, as must fully answer
the Expectation of the World. For You bring with
You, that Vivacity and Sprightlyness of a fair and
Active Youth to undertake it, a Genius and a Soul,
and all the warmth of a Publick Spirit to execute it; and
to both these, that unshaken Fidelity to Crown the
Hand that holds it. Nay not to want even the least
Ornament or Decoration of Dignity, You bring a
Person too even to grace the Honour You wear.
Thus as a Vigilant and Faithful Magistrate is a true
Crown Jewel, Your Prince and Your Country, those
two great Ascendants, being Your Lordships whole
Influencing Powers, You challenge all the Qualificati∣ons
for the Highest and clearest Lustre that that tru∣ly
Royal Jem can bear.
Nay Your Accession to Magistracy gives us this
particular Observation, that Your Lordship enters
the Seat, left You so warm with the Merit that fill'd
it before You, to whose worth and Virtues Your
Lordship brings not only a Succession, but an Allyance
too. Thus as the Encouragement of Religion, and
the Suppression of Vice have been so Exemplar a La∣bour
and Endeavour before You, Your Lordship

Approaches enricht with those Principles and that
Zeale, for the effectual keeping up those Sacred Fa∣sces
of Authority so descended and lodged in Your
Hand; that all Good Men live in hopes that such
Leading Originals may stand as lasting Patterns e∣ven
to latest Generations And thus in this great Work
so well begun and so continued, though Your Lord∣ship's
Dignity is that Honour which You hold
but one short Year, nevertheless, You will lay those
Foundations of that Glory as will last to Ages; in
which true Propheticks, give me leave to Write my
self,
My Lord,
