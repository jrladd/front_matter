Hopefull Gentlemen, and Apprentices,
THis Dedication may seem strange, but the nature of this business is such, that I know not where more fitly to desire shelter, than from your selves, you gene∣rally abov all others having learning and ingenuity to apprehend, leasure to peruse, and occasion to use all these present pieces, as the best remedy yet extant to perfect the Orthography of our English Tongue, with Iudgement, Art, and Experience. Your universal and unanimous complaints of your wants herein, and the view of your Shop-books, Receits, Bils, and Let∣ters to your best and dearest Friends, and not only a∣mgst you, but indeed usually amongst most of men, there being few able rationally and artificially to write
 our Mother tongue, hath prevailed with me to make an offer of my earnest desire of your favour to patronize and protect these rules of Syllabication, and directi∣ons for the use of these two Tracts, contrived and com∣posed for the speedy profit, and perfecting of all first Learners to spell, read, and write our English Tongue; An Art, the Mystery whereof you may well find out, with that Trade you are set apart to learn to live by: which being don, I know you may thereby, not only un∣speakably profit, and benefit your selvs, but also vent the Mystery thereof, as far, or farther than your Wares, which to all well disposed youth will be a glory, a delight, and a profit; but knowing that long ago you have learned what this means, Verbum sapienti, relying upon your Candor, and Ingenuity herein, I am,
March, 1654.
