SEynge and vnderstandynge mooste honourable lady your great mynde and depe affection bothe to∣warde al maner of lernyng / and spe∣cially towarde that / whiche either exciteth or tea¦cheth vertue & goodnes / and concerneth the way of our saluacion / I haue translated out of Latin in to englishe a sermon of Erasmus of the mercy of god: the whiche trāslated for you / and dedicate vnto your ladyshyp, I thought it shuld be a good dede / if for your ladisshyps pleasure it were prin∣ted & spred abrode: And where as afore lerned mē only dyd get out both pleasure and great frute in redyng of this boke / nowe euery mā as wel rude as lerned may haue this sermon of the mercy of god as cōmon vnto him as ye mercy of god it selfe is. And as touchyng ye cōmēdacion either of the autor or of ye warke, I knowe the tēdernes of my wyt moche more slēder thā that I can be able to beare the weyght of suche an enterprise, & I rekē to be moche better to holde my tōge vtterly frō y• preysyng / thā of them to speke to littel, & for faute of wyt to minishe their excellēce. Yet nethelesse it semeth expediēt vnto me, yt by your ladishyp bref∣ly other folke may knowe how noble is the autor of this warke / & how moche we be boūde to hym for it. The autor of the boke is Erasmus Rotero∣damus / 

whom my preyses can no more ennoble / thā the son with a candel may be made clerer. He is the man / to whom in lernynge no lyuyng man may hym selfe cōpare: and nat only passeth them that be alyue / but also from the most part of olde autors hath beraft ye price / and nat onely paynēs and gentyls but also Chrsten doctors. He is ye mā that whan in his fyrst dayes trouth was far hyd in the depe veines of the grounde / and more ouer it was prohibited as a thyng being worthy deth yt no man shulde for her enquere, he dyd nat suffre the worlde to be cōfounded with suche a maruey∣lous darknes, and either he hath dygged vp ma∣ny ȳmes of trouth / or at the lest he hath restored vs free libertie to serche her. He is the mā that to Isaac may be compared / the whiche dygged vp the goodly spryngyng welles / that the Philistēs distroied and with dyrte & donge ouerfylled. The clere springes of the holy scripture / that ye Phili∣stiēs had so troubled / so marred / and so defiled / yt no man coude drynke or haue the true taste of the water / they be nowe by his labour and diligence to their olde purenes and clerenes so restored yt no spotte nor erthly fylthe in them remayneth. And though ye Philistiēs dyd al that they coude to di∣sturbe hym from his holy purpose / and yt amōge the people by the reason of them / he was greatly hated and enuied / yet at the last as it chanceth al∣way vnto them that with a bold stomake in their good dedes do contynue / excellent vertue hath o∣uercome enuy / whan frō this mā there can come

out nothing but both it is excedyng {pro}fitable and on euery side all perfect / me thynketh yt this litell treatise being in euery poynt as perfect as any o∣ther be in profit / nat only giueth no place but also greatly passeth: for where afore the warkes that he made were {pro}fitable but specially to one kynde of men / his Prouerbes / his Newe Testament / and many other treatyses onely to lerned men / of the boke of ye Instruction of princis ye moste pro∣fit redūdeth to princes. This boke only with the boke called ye knife or wepō of a Christē owdiour hath so far spredde abrode his fruteful branches, that ther is no mā but great frute gether he may out of it / except he that thynketh that it maketh no matter whether he be dampned or saued. And as for the knyfe of a Christē sowdiour whiche he nameth Enchiridion, it bryngeth a man out of the way of vicis / and leadeth hym in the way of ver∣tue and the path of saluation. This littel treatise of the mercy of god teacheth a man to ascribe no∣thyng to hym selfe / but all to gether to the mercy of god / seing that the fre wyl it selfe that we be in¦dewed with all / is the fre gyfte of almighty god / and except it were by him made clerer / it shuld be so darke with the rust of the original synne, that ye image of vertue in it shulde neuer be fast printed. And who so euer beyng entred in to ye kyngdome of god by bapyme doth ascribe any thyng to his owne wysedome / to his merites, and to his deser∣uynges / and nat aknowlegeth euery where his owne feblenes / trusting vpon ye fre grace & mercy

of almyghty god / it is to be drade / leest for mercy that is euery where redy for hym that calleth / he proue the sore and rigorous iustice of god. Nowe let vs se whither it be more expediēt for a mannis saluaciō, either by iustice to be feared from synne, or by mercy to be enticed bothe to loue and to ver∣tue. Iustyce with her sore thretnynges cōpelleth a mā to flee vice / and engēdreth in hym a certayn bōdly feare / that it is an odious thyng vnto hym to cōmit synne / nat for ye hate it selfe of sinne, but for feare of punishemēt. Mercy cōtrary to it put∣teth before a mannes face the vnspekable loue of god towarde hym, ye whiche so loued him, that he dyd nat spare his onely sonne for his sake / the in∣credible benefites / the infinite desire of his salua∣cion / the continuall callyng vpon hym to brynge hym to the euerlastyng blysse. Of ye other side she sheweth hym as if it were in a glasse / the weake∣nes and feblenes of a man / the perilles that he is compassed about with, the calamites, the miseri, ye wretchednes that on euery side do vtterly hym wrappe, and that in so many mischeues, there co∣meth no succour but fro the mercy of god / do nat all these engēdre in hym a certaine childyshe loue towarde his father / that he wyl performe his cō∣maundemētes / nat for feare of punishement / nor for loue of rewarde, but for bicause it pleaseth his most louyng father? And that he accompted this a very great rewarde to do the thyng that dothe lyke suche a good father. And where as it is sayd that ye feare of our lorde is the beginnyng of wise¦dome / 

though the same feare somwhat cōcerneth the drede of iustice / yet I reken that it is nat to be taken for that bondly feare yt maketh vs to drede the sore punyshemētes, but for that that maketh vs to loke about / that we do nothyng that shulde displease our most louyng father, orels feare with out loue longeth to a cruel tyrant / that careth nat for the peoples hatred, so they feare him / and nat to ye most mercifull lorde & father of vs all / whose loue towarde mankynde neither with minde can be comprehended nor with wordes any thyng ex∣pressed. The whiche seynge that he loueth vs so moche, and that all our helpe and soccour cometh from hym / let vs set al our trust and confidence in hym, withdrawyng al our trust and our hope frō al mortal thynges / & from al mortal mē. Yf we be in nede / let vs cal vpō him, he is benigne / he is li∣beral / he gyueth gladlier than other do take / if so y• we make hym nat a nygarde in askyng of smal thȳges & vnworthy of hym to be gyuē. If we be in synne let vs cal vpō his mercy / being sory & re∣pentāt. Whan so euer a synner is truely repētant he forgyueth al maner of synne. Here amōge mē they yt do forgyue syn haue nat al an egall power: som cases be reserued to ye pope / & of ye popes him selle power som do put a great dout: but god him selfe is he yt hath rule both in heuē & in erth, there is no dout yt of his autorite & power can be made. If we desyre to come to the euerlastyng felicite / & eschewe the feareful peynes of hell / let vs beseche his mercy to kepe vs frō sinne / & gyue vs strēgth

to ulfyll his wyll and his cōmandmētes / and so done / let vs put vs al holle to his pleasure & mer∣cy / & let vs nat trust vpō certayn vayne prayers / the whiche with moche error be spred amōge mē, as though they had this vertue & power / yt who so euer mūbleth them vp shal eschewe euerlastȳg punyshemētes. O subtile serpent / o disceitfull di∣uel, howe various, howe crafty be thyn imagina∣ciōs? bicause he seeth yt frō our simple & stedfaste beleue he can nat bryng vs away / he goth about to bring vs in to an odious supersticiousnes / and bicause he seeth that that mā can nat do amisse / yt vpō the mercy of god setteth his holle trust / he {per}∣suadeth rude and ignorant foles to set their trust vpon vaine thȳges, that they shulde set only vpō god. Surely suche he is / and he wyll neuer ceasse to let vs frō our iourney heuēward / out of whiche place he was ouerthrowē. But the mo wiles and subtilties yt he worketh / the more grace & strēgth god giueth vs to withstand hym. But it is tyme most honorable lady to lay by my rude and vnlo∣quēt lāgage, yt ye may here Erasm{us} speke eloquēt¦ly / and in your owne mothers tōge very playnly, the whiche so cōmendeth to the herers ye vnmea∣surable and infinite mercy of god / yt who so euer in his hart fast printeth it, he shal finde out of it a maruelo{us} great frute both to know his owne mi∣sery / and of god the infinite boūte / yt whiche two thynges be most effectuous to directe vs to the e∣uelasynge flycite / that is Christe Iesus / the whiche preserue your ladyshyppe and all yours.
AMEN.
