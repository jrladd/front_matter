RIght honorable and my very good Lord, that which Orator Tertullus attributed to the gouernor Foelix flatteringly, may be applied to your Lordship iustly and truly; By your meanes we enioy much quietnes,
Act. 24. ver. 2. and very worthy deeds are done vnto this nation by your prouidence. That great Tri∣bunall in which your Lord∣ship
sits as President doth manifest it, and the large Weasterne circuit, which for the administration of iustice, as cheife Iustice, you haue often visited,
Verse 3. doth alwaies, and in all places acknowledge it with all thankfulnes.
Iob 29.11. The Eare which hath heard you, doth blesse you, and the Eye that hath seene you doth giue witnesse vnto you: for mine owne part aboue all others I haue most iust cause to blesse you, and God for you: when my peace was disquieted, my person troubled, and my profession hindered,
Psal. 41.12.11 Ministery di∣ssurbed, your Lordship hath vouchsafed to heare the plea
of mine innocence, and to vphold mee in mine integritie, So that mine enemie doth not triumph ouer mee. In regard whereof to whom can I more fitly dedicate this smal Treatise of The practice of Quietnesse, the first fruites of my Quietnesse, then vnto your Lordship, the Author of my Quietnes? It is a sa∣crifice which I haue vo wed to the Lord for my Quiet∣nesse, and the testimony which I would giue vnto the world of my loue of Quietnesse. Vnder your honorable protection I make it publicke to the world, first humblie offe∣ring
it vnto your Lordships fauourable acceptation, cra∣uing pardon for this my presumption, and beseech∣ing almighty God to poure vpon your Lordship all the riches of his grace for the Quietnesse of your owne soule and body, for the publicke Quietnesse of the Church and common wealth, and for your eter∣nall and euerlasting hap∣pinesse.
