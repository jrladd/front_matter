YOur Lordshippes gentle
humanitie toward all ho∣neste
and well-hearted
men, and namely, towards
me, since my first acquain∣tance,
hath mooved mee, to dedicate to
your honour, this parte of the fruite of my
studies, knowing, that amongst the rare
Mecenases of this Land, your name is
with the highest ranke, vnder his Maie∣stie
to be mentioned. The first cause (I
confesse) that mooved mee to publish this
Treatise in our English tongue, was to
disswade the too curious conceites of cer∣taine
men, desirous to be at Rome this ap∣proching

1600. yeare commonly called a
year of Iubilee, wherof they shuld receiue no
profit, but rather domage, with losse of time
& expenses. For your L. knows wel ynough
the maners of Rome, & (as I am perswa∣ded)
allowes not of that pompose supersti∣tion:
yet if your L. wil take paines (not be∣ing
fashed with more weighty matters) to
reade this whole discourse, I trust you shall
finde other heads, whereof you shal like ve∣rie
well, that haue troubled the heades of
learned men, and not bene so exactly found
out. Wishing your L. to accept of this smal
token of my good fauor towards your honor,
and to accept of me amongst the clientele
of your friendship, wherfore God-willing,
ye shall not finde me vnworthie. To whose
almightie protection, I commit your L.
This last of October. 1599.
