To the Mighty, Magnificent, Potent, and Powerfull Knight, Sir
Thomas Parsons, (alias) Pheander, (alias,) Knight of the Sunne, Great Champion
to Apollo, Palatine of Phoebus, Sword-hearer to Sol, Tilter, to Tytan, Housekeeper to
Hyperion, and heire apparant to the inuisible kingdome of the Fairies: your
deuoted Votary, IOHN TAYLOR, wisheth your Worshits wisdomes Longi∣tude,
Latitude, Altitude, and Crassitude may increase aboue the Ri∣diculous
multitude of the most eminent Stultorums
of this latter age.

To thee braue knight, who from the Delphia god come
 cōsecrate these famous Acts of Odcomb:
To thee alone, and vnto none but thee,
For Patronage my toyling Muse doth flee,
I gaue my drowning Coriat vnto Archy,
And with his faire escape to thee now march I,
Not doubting but thou wilt in kindnesse take
These lines thus writ, for his, and thy deare sake.
If thou in kindnesse wilt accept this taske,
Hereafter I will better things vn-caske,
And make the world thy worth to glory at,
In greater measure then at Coriat.
I'l mount thee vp in verse past Charles his Wain,
I'l make the Moone Endimion to disdaine,
I'l write in euer-during lines thy fame,
As farre as Phoebus spreads his glorious flame.
I'l make thee plucke sterne Saturne by the Chaps,
And braue great Ioue amids his thunder-clappes.
I'l cause thy praise t'eclipse the god of Armes,
I'l make Dame Venus yeeld to loues alarmes.
The nimble Mercury shall be thy foot-man,
If thou wilt grace my lines, therfore looke too ma
But if to patronize me thou dost scorne,
'Twere better then, thou neuer hadst beene borne:
For 'gainst difdaine my Muses onely sport is,
To write with Gall, commixt with Aqua-fortis:
And Vineger, and Salt, and Sublimatum,
Which where it falls, wil scortch & scald: probatu,
Then as thou lou'st the Fairy Queene thine, Aunt,
Daine to vouchsafe this poore and triuiall grannt:
Then I thy Poet will with low Subiection,
Proceed to write Tom Coriats Resurrection.
