BRETHREN, Meeting ye out
of the Assembly, or that
bounder appointed ye by Parl.
I cannot justly be denied
this reasoning with ye; for the
Ordinance by which ye sit, doth
enable ye onely to advice of things propound∣ed,
but not to propound or demand any as ye
have done of late;See Or∣din. Jun. 12. 1043. p. 4. so as in this ye have brought
your selves down to the same magnitude with

us that are private men. Here is the difference
now; Ye are many of better parts and abilities;
I am as one born out of due time; yet the
same Covenant is upon me with your selves,
nor ought I because I am but one, presume to
see Truth more then ye because ye are many;
nor, I hope, ye who are many, will presume to
see Truth more then one, because ye are many;
Nay,2 Pet. 1. 17. it is that voice from the excellent glo∣ry
which both you and I must hear, and which
can onely teach us Truth; It is not the voice of
any other. And surely since Truth hath had its
lot in the world to live upon voices in Assem∣blies
and Synods, where that is onely Truth
which is voted so; and not in its own glory and
evidence, where that is onely Truth which is
so: The Mystery of iniquity hath been more
advanced then the Mystery of godlinesse.
