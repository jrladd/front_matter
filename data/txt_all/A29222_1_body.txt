Dear Brethren, and loving Countrymen,
I Have lavisht out 80 years in jollity & pleasure, loosing the reins of liberty to all libidinous de∣sires, glutting my self with the vain delights of this wretched world, mispending that precious time my gracious God of his abundant goodness bestowed upon me for his own service solely. So as I am now become that Dives our Saviour spake of, daily tormented with the pain of fore-passed pleasure: And lest you my Countrymen should not heare Moses or the Prophets, I have sent you this mes∣sage from a dying man, To amend your Lives, lest you fall into the Lake where you may cry for a cup of cold water to cool your tongues, and be denied it. Happy is he whom other mens harms doe make to beware. For your souls sake, and for Jesus Christs sake, lay to heart what is here in charity presented, by a plain Country-man, your friend and well-wisher,
