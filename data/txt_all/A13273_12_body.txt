PATIENCE preuailes (when Passions are vndon)
This doth This Volume truly intimate:
So doth Your Vertue, firm, and fortunate,
Now cheer'd with Radiance of our Royall Sun.
O! long and Happy may Hee shine vpon
So Noble a Plant (mo Such to propagate)
So Grace-full, Vse-full, both in Court and State;
Help-full to All, Hurt-full at-all to None.
Among Those Many whom your Worth hath won
(Of either Sexe, of euery Age, and State)
With glad Applauses to congratulate
The worthie Honour of Your Charge begun
(Though not (perhaps) so long and lowd, as Many)
Accept My AVE, as Deuout as Any,
