RIght Worshipfull, there is held an infallible opinion, that the sacred Art of Musicke (being chiefly illustrated by Voyces) not∣withstanding all Artists, in respect of the compasse and quality of voyces and instruments, doe limit it within scales and other certaine dimensions, is in it owne nature INFINITE; reach∣ing from the base Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the highest E. LA. of the incomprehensible hea∣uens: For demonstration whereof, GOD to his great Glory, doth diuersly and wonderfully enable his creatures thereunto, teaching man vpon earth, not onely in mellifluous Notes to chant; but also vpon variety of Instruments sweetly to expresse the hidden secrets of that sacred Science, & not leauing the vast Ayre empty of his glory; he instructeth the early Larke to warble forth his prayse; who, (as somehould) learneth his layes from the musicall motions of the heauen∣ly Spheares, and from thence to transcend vp to the seate of the most highest, the elected Saints and Angels doe in heauenly Himmes, sing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinitie, sitting on the Throne of most Maiesticke glorie.
In which quality of Musicke (Right worshipfull) hauing spent a great part of my time, I haue now (after some others) of late produced this small peece of worke; which albeit for the insufficiency thereof, I doe hold to be too vnworthie to be presented to your Worship, yet in regarde of the many and manifold fauors, which I haue receiued at your hands, and your exquisit skill, both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I doe presume to tender it to your Patronage and protection, chusing rather to be censured for ouer-boldnesse, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulnesse. And so humbly desiring your Worship to ac∣cept of this, and to shield it from all pragmaticall and stigmaticall detractors; vn∣till my best skill and endeauour, shall incite my weake Muse to performe some worke of better worth, I craue pardon for my bouldnesse, and commit your Wor∣ship and the good Lady your wife, to the blessed tuition of the GOD of Israell.
From my mansion in the Monastery of Chester
