RIGHT WORSHIP.
WHen I consider the manifold fa∣vours
and courtesies that I have
found at your hands, I am ready
to say unto my selfe, as Ruth said
once to Boaz, Ruth 2. 10. Qua∣re
inveni gratiam? Why have I found grace
in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me,
seeing I am a stranger? For mine owne part I
can impute it to nothing, but unto Gods goodnesse,
and your owne worthinesse: And my onely ambi∣tion
is to make you this acknowledgement that the

world may see, though I am poore, I am thankefull.
Now as Ioab wisht to David in another case, 2
Sam. 24. 3. so wish I to you, The Lord God adde
unto your estate, how much soever it be, an hundred
fold, and that your eyes may see it, and your heart
may rejoyce in it all the dayes of your life.
