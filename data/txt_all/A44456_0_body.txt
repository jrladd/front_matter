My LORD,
I Am sufficiently conscious that there is no∣thing in this plain Discourse, but the honest design it prosecutes, worthy of that acceptance it found with the Honourable Audience before whom it was preached. Nevertheless, since it's your Lordship's pleasure, that I should make it more publick than I ever designed, I dare not dispute your commands or doubt your Patronage. I am sure I need it in a high degree, whether I consider the weakness of the discourse it self, or into what an ill-natured and censorious World it adventures. But I am little concerned what reception will be given it by curious and criti∣cal

Readers, who reade and hear Sermons, as they do Plays, merely for entertainment, and to shew what Judges they are. I was not so san∣guine either in the preaching or publishing of it as to expect it should doe much good on that sort of men.
But to persons of Piety and Candour, who receive the Word of God into good and honest hearts, I hope it may not be unserviceable. And if it may in any measure contribute toward the making us more truly penitent for what is past, or a more obedient people for the future, I shall think my self happy, and thankfully a∣dore him whose strength was made manifest in my weakness.
To the Divine Protection and Blessing I hum∣bly commend your Lordship, your Honourable Brethren and this great City which flourishes under your just and prudent Administration, and intreat your acceptance of this poor Testimo∣ny that I am in all humility,
My LORD,
