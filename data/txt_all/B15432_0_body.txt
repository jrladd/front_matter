How farre I stand from flattery; J appeale: What J have done, is but a small Posie, gathered out of
his Garden: Happy is he, whose Herse can be stucke with such flowers: Sir, such is my confidence, that I question not your gentle Acceptance, for his sake that loves you and yours; But J acknowledge it a fuller Testimony of my affection then his worth, though short of both: For the last, the world will supply: for the first, let your goodnesse excuse
