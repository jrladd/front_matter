SIr, it may seeme strange that I should be thus far bold to make choyce of your selfe, a pa∣tron of so slender a work, (espe∣cially being so little knowne vn∣to you as I am:) but howsoeuer, I protest what is done, procee∣deth from the vnfained loue I beare vnto you, your owne de∣merit,

your friendes hope, & the good reporte of all men. All which, are liuely-witnesses of your loue to the Muses, your grace with fortune, & your fame with the worlde, quickened in your birth, increased in your trauailes, and liuing after death. Daigne (sweete sir) to pardon the matter, iudge fauorably of the manner, and accept both: so shall I euer rest yours in all dew∣tifull affection.
