My Lady,
I hope (without so much as the suspicion of Flattery) I may rec∣kon it as your Priviledge, of which you have enjoy'd the sweet∣est Experience, not only to know God, but rather to be known of him: The discovery of Grace shines illustriously on many in the Declarations of the Gospel, but few are begotten of an incorrup∣tible Seed: I rejoice in the Evi∣dences
 of that distinguishing Grace, which has visited your Soul. Your Presence in Religi∣ous Assemblies, as it is necessary to build you up in your most holy Faith; so your Countenancing of Religion by so constant an At∣tendance, is an Encouragement to others to look Heaven-ward: May the Knowledge of the Bles∣sed Jesus increase in your Mind, by the Holy Spirits taking of the things of Christ, and shew∣ing them to you. May your Graces be as Resplendent as your Honour, your Relish of Heaven∣ly Things be daily sweeter, and your believing estimate of Di∣vine Objects be much higher than any peculiar value which your
 greatest Admirers can express towards you on Earth. There's no Condition but is attended with Snares, Grandeur is not less dangerous than meaner Circum∣stances: May the Lord himself therefore preserve both your Ho∣nours by his Mighty Power, through Faith unto Salvation. I am, my Lord and Lady,
Mary Magd. Bermondsey, May 20. 1700.
