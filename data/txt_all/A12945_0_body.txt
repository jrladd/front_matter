IF I HAD NOT OF
longe tyme past conceyued a sure
truste, and great confydence, most
noble prince, of your synguler gē∣tylnes,
and accustomed humani∣tie,
which dayly to the great com∣fort
of al your seruātes & subiectes, your highnes
declareth openly, I wolde neuer haue vsed such
boldnes and audacite, as to exhibyte and present
this my rude writynge, vnto your gracis mooste
indifferent iudgement. For moche and longe I
haue doubted with my selfe, whether hit shulde
pertayne vnto me, other by worde or by writyng,
to touche any suche matters of weyght and gra∣uyte.
For as on the one syde, many thynges mo∣ued
me' to kepe silence, consyderynge myn own
state, condition, and degre, and how late I was
admytted to the seruyce of youre maiestye, and
howe lyttell experte I am in matters of polycie:
so on the other syde, dyuers thynges styrred me,
to open myne affecte and pourpose, vnto your
grace playnly. For moued I was moche by this
your great and synguler humanyte, wherin a∣monge
all other princely vertues your highnes
excellyth: moued I was also by the highe iuge∣mente,
which by the goodnes of god aboue other
princis is to you gyuen, in al maters of tru reli∣gion
and of iuste polycy: and aboue all moued I

was by the present state of our coūtrey & weigh∣ty
nature of thinges perteining to the same now
in controuersy here amonge vs: In the redresse
and due order wherof (as I thynke) stondeth the
chiefe poynte of all pryncely honour, and nother
in abundance of golde, syluer, nor tresure, nor yet
in any worldly power, but euen as the honour of
god, as moche as is set forth to mans iugement,
consysteth and stondethe in the dewe order of all
this sensible worlde, whiche with our eies dayly
we beholde, so the tre we honour of all princis a∣pon
erthe, resteth chiefly in the order and redresse
of their commynalties, by the prouidence of god
to their gouernaunce commytted, to this ende &
purpose, that all theyr subiectes in concorde and
vnyte may inioye suche quietnes and felicite, as
they are broughte forth vnto, by the goodnes of
god and nature: so that this beinge mouyd, and
reasonyng with my selfe of such thinges as per∣teyne
to your gracys honour chiefely, to the whi∣che
I shall serue euer durynge my lyfe faythful∣ly,
I coud not tēpre my selfe, nor as me thoughte
in no parte satysfie my bounden duetie, excepte
by some meane I shulde open myn affect to your
gratious maiestie. For greatte sorowe I concey∣ued
as sone as I entred into my countrey, after
my long absence and peregrination, obseruyng
suche disobedience and diuersitie of opinion, as
here amonge your subiectes was growynge in
by corrupte iugement, to great confusion, and

to the great breche of christian vnitie, while your
grace by your high wisedom & polycye studied to
lay & stablyshe certayn groūdes & fundations, to
the restoryng of very, true, and christen vnite mo∣che
necessary. wherfore sone after I began with
my self to reson of certayn causes & occasiōs, out
of the which chiefely as it appered to me, sprang
all this controuersie & disobedience lately shewid
here among vs: and somwhat to consyder I be∣gan
also the manner & mean howe al suche discord
and diuersitie of opinion vtterly put awaye, we
myght as membres of one body, being couplyd
togyther, and knytte agayne in vnitie, runne in
one course and after one fascion: the whiche dis∣course
and reasonyng, bycause I lacked cōmodi∣te
to open to your grace presently, I gathered in
writyng, & so presented it vnto your maiestie, de∣claring
therby myn opinion, and by what meane
we all your subiectes with mekenes & humilite,
lyuyng togyther in due obedience, myght restore
and conserue this christen vnitie. This was my
purpose, only in no poynt thinkyng than to haue
my sentence and writyng abrode publyshed. And
though it be so, that for the moste part suche men
as be in hart most desirous, to haue their writin∣ges
set abrode to the face of the worlde, cōmonly
vse this kynde of excuse, coueringe their affecte &
studi of glory with one honest pretext of sobrenes
and humilitie, to say they wrote eyther for theyr
owne exercyse secretly, or for the priuate pleasure

of their frende onely, wherby they auoyde and es∣chewe
al note and suspition of pride & arrogācy:
yet to your highnes most noble prince, this may
I say truly, and without al colour affirm playn∣ly,
that at suche tyme as I presc̄ted this my wri∣ting
vnto your grace at winchester in sōmer last
past, I though nothynge lesse, than to publyshe
it to the cōmon iugement, though in euery mans
mynde the thinge to be fyxed I desired hartely:
but I thought plainly, partly for bicause I iuge
not my writynge to be of that sorte, which are to
be set out to lyghte, and partely bycause I se the
world al redy with ouer many bokes and writin∣ges
troubled dangerously, wherby though moch
knowledge of the truth be opened & broughte to
lyght, yet by lacke of discretion, and by moch ar∣rogancy,
there is growen in withall in Christis
church a gret brake of christiā charite: I thought
I say playnly, & to me it appered sufficiente, spe∣cially
concernyng suche matters of weight and
grauitie, to your hyghnes only by my writinge
myn opinyon to declare, & the affecte and desyre,
which I haue long noryshed in my hart to srue
your grace withal, in some part therby to testifie.
For syth the tyme y• I haue had any reson & iuge¦mēt
to consider the end, to the which al true sub∣iectes
ought to referre all their actes & dedes, I
haue euer fashioned my studyes after suche ma∣ner,
that I might therby according to my boūdē
duetie, in som part serue your highnes & my coū∣trey,

to the which stirred & moued I am now mo¦che
by the time, wherin I trust to se, by your high
wisedom & policy, of al such abusion, as by {pro}cesse
of time is growen in to our church and cōgrega∣tion,
a holsom, quiet, & iust reformation: wher∣of
though the begīning hath bē somwhat rough
and ful of difficultie, yet I truste the prouidence
of god, vsyng your highnes as chefe mynister to
the same, shall at the laste, all thynges soo order
and dispose, that they shall procede, bothe to the
cōmyn quietnes of vs your subiectes in this pre∣sent
age, & to the great cōfort of al your posterite.
So y• as wel for the steying of the one part of su∣che
disobedience, to be conceyued in the hartis of
som other of your subiectis, which might mini∣ster
a great occasion to the plāting of the rote of
a sedition, as for the tēpering on the other part of
a blynd & an arrogant opinion, lately conceyued
by lyghtnes of iugemēt, which might bring in a∣mong
vs moche confusion, I wrote this thinge,
declaringe therby vnto your highenes, what I
thought in the mater, and how as I sayd before,
bothe I my selfe was affected, and howe at the
leest I wold wysshe the hartis of your subiectis
after like maner to be īstructed: for y• which cause
I conceyued this exhortation vnto your people,
instructing thē to suche obedience as is dewe to
your prīcely authorite. This was my purpose at
y• beginnyng & ful intent, nothing lesse hauinge
in mynd, as I before recyted, then to publishe the





thyng abrode to the world: but now sithe it hath
pleased your grace moste noble prynce, by your
highe wysedome and most indifferent iudgemēt,
the thyng to aproue, whiche I haue written, and
by your goodnes it to accepte and alowe, I shall
not feare to set it forthe to the cōmon redynge &
indifferent iudgement of your subiectes openly,
nothynge dystrustynge, but that by the gracious
goodnes of hym, who gouerneth al, it shall thus
appreued by your gracis authorite, in some part
helpe, both to restore & confirme here among vs
true obedience and christian vnytie, wherby we
al your true subiecies, beinge obediente to your
hyghnes, as to our supreme heed vnder Christe
here in this churche and congregation, shal both
in this age liue in perfyt quietnes and tranquil∣lite,
and herafter also, to the them that shal succede,
leaue a quiet cōmon wele, to the cōmon comforte
of all our posterite, and at the last with heuenly
vnite atteine & inioy with our heuēly hed Christ,
the onely hede of the vnyuersal churche, euerlas∣ting
felicite. This hope I haue fastned ī mi hart,
nothing doubting at al, but y• y• goodnes of him,
whose prouydence hath ordeyned your grace to
reigne in our tyme, lighting your hart with such
knowlege of truthe, as few other christian prin∣cis
haue in our daies, shal inspire in to your most
noble mynde, the ryght iudgement of all conue∣niēt
menes, wherby your highnes the better may
the same truth set forth to his honour & glory.
