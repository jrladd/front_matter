Honoured Sir,
THough by that Splendor
with which the boun∣tifull
hand of Fortune,
illustrated by the more
excellent Gifts of Na∣ture,
hath Adorn'd you, to the illuminating
the Hopes of all your expecting
Friends: I might justly fear these Glow∣worms
of Fancy may be out-shone,
to the obscurity of a contemptible Neg∣lect;
You being like, ere long, to prove
that glorious Luminarie, to whose
ascending Brightness the happiest Wits

that grace the British Hemisphear,
like Persian Priests, prostrated to the
rising Sun, will devote the Morning Sa∣fices
of their Muses: Yet Animated by
your late Candid Reception of my more
Youthfull Labours, whose humble flights
having your Name to beautifie their
Front, past the publick View unsullied,
by the cloudy Aspect of the most Critick
Spectator: I have once more assumed
the boldness to let the Infirmities of my
Fancy take Sanctuary under the Name
of so honoured a Patron. Though my
Abilities could not Cloath Her in such
Robes, as would render Her a fit
Companion for your serious Studies,
yet I hope her Dress is not so sordid, but
she may prove an acceptable Attendant
on your more vacant Hours. For my
Subject (it being Heroick Poesie)
it is such as the wiser part of the World

hath alwaies held in a Venerable Esteem,
the Extracts of Fancy being that noble
Elixer, which Heaven ordain'd to Im∣mortalize
their Memories, whose wor∣thy
Actions being the Products of that
nobler part of Man, the Soul, is by this
made, almost Commensurate with Her
Eternity; which otherwise (to the sor∣row
of succeeding Ages) who are in debt
for much of their Vertue to a noble E∣mulation
of their glorious Ancestors, had
either terminated in a Circle of no larger
a Diameter then Life; or like short
breath'd Ephemera's, only surviv'd a
while in the Aiery Region of Di∣scourse.
This, Sir, having been the past
Fortune of our Predecessors; And,
as the Pregnant Hopes of your bloom∣ing
Spring, promises the World like to
be yours in the future; yours, when

both the splendid Beauties of your most
glorious Palace, and the lasting Stru∣cture
of your Marble Domitory, time
shall have so levigated, that the wanton
Winds dally with their Dust: I doubt
not but to find you so much a Mecaenas,
as to affect the Eternizing of your
Name, more from the lasting Linea∣ments
of Learning, then those vaine
Phainomena of Pleasures, which are
the low Delights of more Vulgar
Spirits.
Though I confess these  be∣neath
the serious View,  a Wit
Acuated with the best Adjuncts of Art,
will, ere long, render the ordinary Re∣creations
of your Progressive Studies;
yet, as in relation to the Latitude for
which they were Calculated: I hope they
may not appear unworthy a present Su∣pervisall;
It being intended (like the

weak Productions of the early Spring)
but for the April of your Age; where,
though my Hopes tell me it may subsist,
whilst irrigated with those balmy Dews
of Passion, which are the usuall Con∣commitants
of Youth: I am not guilty
of so un-becoming a Boldness, as to think
it fit to stand the heat of your more vigo∣rous
Maturity, when the Meridian Al∣titude
of your Comprehensive Judgment
shall have attain'd so neer an universali∣ty
of Knowledge; As the Sun when in its
Apogaeum, doth of Light, that being on∣ly
hindred by a Comparatively Punctil∣lo
of Earth; As the powerfull Energies
of noble Souls, are by the upper Gar∣ments
of their Mortality, from being at
once Ubiquitary Blessings.
Fortifi'd by these Considerations,
with the hope of your Acceptance, and
assur'd, that prefixing your Name, is an

Amulet of sufficient power to preserve
me from the Contagion of Censure; I
have, with an unruffl'd Confidence, given
these Papers a Capacity of being pub∣lickly
viewed: If their being lik'd at∣tain
but neer the Dimensions of your be∣ing
belov'd, it will co-equate the know∣ledge
the World shall have of them; that
being so universall, as the Serenities
of your Bliss is the happiness of your
neerest Relations; so is it much of the
hopes of those, that only know you at a
remoter distance: And shall be still
the Prayer of,
SIR,

Shaftsbury,
May 12.
1659.
