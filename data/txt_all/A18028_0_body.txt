Right Honourable,
THis poore Infant of mine, which I now offer to Your Honourable acceptance, was consecrated Yours in the first conception: If the hasty desire I had to present it, makes it (as an abortiue brat) seeme vnworthy

my first wishes, and Your fauourable Patronage; impute it (I beseech You) not to Selfe-will but Duty; which would rather shew herselfe too of∣ficious, then negligent. What I now dedicate ra∣ther to Your Honour, then mine owne Ambition, I desire no farther to bee accompted Mine, then Your generous approbation: wishing it no other fate, then either to dye with Your Dislike, or liue with Your Name and Memory. The generall Acclamation of the Learned of this Age, ac∣knowledging with all thankefull Duty, as well Your Loue to Learning, as Zeale to Religion, hath long since stampt me Yours. This arrogant Desire of mine, grounded more on Your Heroicke ver∣tues, then my priuate ends, promised mee more in Your Honourable Estimation, then some others in Your Greatnesse. The expression of my selfe in these faculties beside my profession, indebted more to Loue, then Ability, setts my Ambition a pinch higher then my Nature. But such is the Magnificent splendour of Your Countenance, which may easily lend Your poore Seruant so much light as to lead him out of Darknesse; and, as the Sunne reflecting on the baser earth, at once both view and guild his Imperfections. My lan∣guage

and formality I owe not to the Court, but Vniuersity; whereof I cannot but expect Your Ho∣nour to be an impartiall Vmpier, being a most vi∣gorous Member of the one, and the Head of the o∣ther Corporation. If these fruites of my Labours purchase so much as Your Honours least Approba∣bation, I shall hold my wishes euen accompli∣shed in their ends, and desire only to be thought so worthy in Your Honourable esteeme, as to liue and dye
