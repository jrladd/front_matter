Brethren and Fathers,
THis Sermon was preached by
your command, and in your
alone audience: nor had it
gone further then those wals,
had not the importunity of
many Reverend Brethren a∣mongst
your selves urged the Publication of it.
The Argument of the Sermon taught me to lay
aside mine own judgment touching the expedien∣cy
or seasonablenesse of this action, seeing the
judgments of so many godly and learned Brethren
concur for it. I have this advantage and benefit
by the publishing of it, that I may return some
small tribute of thanks for those many grave,
judicious, and learned Debates, those many gra∣cious
and heavenly excercises, that sweet and

most delightfull Society, whereof I have been
made a partaker by sitting amongst you; which
truly have made my life, amidst many great los∣ses
and greater infirmities, more cheerfull to me,
then even mine own judgment in such sad and
calamitous times could otherwise willingly have
allowed it to be. Yet it will be a farther accession
unto this content, if you shall be pleased to accept
of this poor part of my labours, first preached in
your hearing, and now submitted to your view;
from him, whose hearts desire and prayer is,
That the Lord (whose you are, and whom you
serve) would prosper all your Labours for the
good of his Church, and make you happy Instru∣ments
of healing the Breaches, reconciling the
Differences, preventing the Confusions, and ad∣vancing
the Peace of his Sion.
