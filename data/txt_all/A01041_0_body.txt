TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL MY TENDER KINSMAN AND DEARE BROTHER IN CHRIST, VVILLIAM STRACHIN, OF TIPPERTIE, GRACE and peace in our Lord Iesus Christ.
RIGHT Worshipfull and dearely be∣loved both in the flesh & in the Lord, when, not long agoe, your love led you to come and visit me, I was, vpon the occasion even then offered, a pen∣ning of this little piece: whereof you craving earnestly, at that time, a copy, and having, there∣with told me how you had left my tender kinsman and your owne faithfull friend Maister Thomas Michel Mi∣nister of the Gospel of Christ, lying sick of an ague: I co∣venanted with you, that, with the first, who from you should bring me assurance of his cōvalescing, you shuld in recompence of so good tidings, report a copy heere∣of. Which accordingly, God to him, you to me, and I to you performed. And whereof you had then a hastelie catched copy, I now send you the principall: and, so, I doe send it, as dedicated to your name that whither so∣ever it shall happen to come, yea if possibly it may befal any so farre to fansie it, as, by print, to publish it to the world, yet it may alwayes cary with it this frontepiece, for a monument of our mutuall affection, & that singu∣lar regard I have you in: not onely for our conjunction in blood, and these many courtesies and kindly offices

wherof you wearie not to hold me still more and more your debtor: but, much more, for these rare christiā ver∣tues, which, in you, are so much the more cōmendable, as, vailed vnder sweet and christiā modestie, and, in sin∣glenes eying God, and carefully attending on a good cōscience, they never were curious, either to be knowen of men, or to currie the applause of the world. Albeit I very well know, that your sincere heart towards God, & constant care of walking christianly with all men, have bred you both the losse of great carnal, and yet but car∣nal friends, and also, many apparant worldly disadvan∣tages. In all which losse, your incōparable commoditie is both huge, in the purchase of that one thing which only is to be sought for, and also, passing praise worthy: in that neither any break of duetie to the one, neither a∣nie errour of iudgement, or defect of prudent and dili∣gent endeavour, in the other, but a free choise of mind, to forgoe willingly, what you could have easilie either holden or acquired, if you would, but therefore would not for that, in conscience, you ought not, hath made you to count light of such thinges, as the men of this world, madly running after, doe lose both them selves and all these things also: and yet heerein the Lord hath dealt so indulgently with you, as you cannot, but, to the praise of his goodnes and truth, acknowledge the verity of his promise, in a hundreth fold gain, euen in this lyfe. When the other yeare, I was dwelling by you, and, so, was delighted with that sweet conversation and happy fellowshippe, which I can never record but both with regret and ioy, you remēber, that, one day, Maister Tho∣mas Michel brought Iohn Fraser his chalenge to the Mi∣nisters of Scotland: which, albeit some yeares ere then, it had bene abroad in our countrie, yet I had never seen

nor heard of, before that time: And, after I had read it, he told me how grealty our countrie-Papists did glorie thereof: And, that so much the more as it had receaved no answer: they imputing that to the strength of their owne, and imbecillitie of our cause: he willed me to cō∣sider if it were not expedient to say something thereto, I answered him then, that they had not great matter of insulting, for any stuffe which was in that treatise: wher∣to to make any answer it were but to maintain an end∣les iangling with men who would never be ashamed to repone vnto vs one and the same, a hundreth times, re∣cocted crambe. that nothing was in him which our mē had not often answered: besides, that, whatsoever might have bene done at the first outcōming thereof, yet now when it was stale, and the author departed this life, any particular answer should appeare vorimous. But, as for the matter specially disputed by him, I was about to pu∣blish my commentarie vpon the Revelation: whereby I hoped all equitable and judicious Readers should find themselves satisfied of all such doubtes, as by his sophi∣stical discourse might arise even to the most simple rea∣ders therof: loving much rather thus to maintain truth, then by contention of disputation. which manner the Church of God hath not, neither mind I for any Thra∣sonik braggs of our adversaries to alter this resolution: though even a litle before your last visitation of me, som copies of a new treatise of theirs (inscribed a litle treatise of the Protestants profane calling, wherein is proved how they have no true Pastours, and consequently no true Church at all) sparsed here in this part of the countrie (the chiefe stage of their peirt pride) with insolent & high boasting, have thus farre in holy indignation caried me, as, in defence of our callings to pen these few pages. not, particularly

to meet that their treatise, but generally, to refell both it, & whatsoever thing els of any apparant weight (in that argument) alledged by any other. I flee particular cōte∣sting loving to cleare points but not to plead with per∣sons: and liking to edifie all, but loathing to scold with any. Albeit, so, I might more clearly discover the chil∣dish and ridiculous ignorāce of whosoever is the author of that litle treatise, and expone him more delightful to the Readers derision. but neither desire I so to dally: & I know that a Brother, before me hath vndertaken the taske to tread him & overturne him in his owne traces. This, truly, I must say, that, though in neither of the two either the first challenge or this late little treatise, there be any such thing, as may trouble the resolution of any meanly stayed mind: yet the last, for any apparant shew of skill, commeth as far short of the other, as he is, other∣wayes, equall with him in high boasting and presump∣tuous promising of wonders, but performing nothing at all. Receave then my dear brother, this little piece of my paines, wherein, and in ought that is mine, you may iustly claime a special interest, and receave it for a token of vpright love, as I maintain a iust cause: and howbeit that either for qualitie or quantitie it bee farre vnequall to the certain truth and great worthines of the matter: Yet, shal it, I hope, affoord you an answere heereafter to any who disdainfully insulting would aske, what say you Maisters for your callings: and to bee as good as your word once given, that, vpon covenant the deman∣ders would read it, You should find an answer to that wherein they think vs put to non plus. The grace of our Lord IESVS CHRIST be with you.
