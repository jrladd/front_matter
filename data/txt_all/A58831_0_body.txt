Right Honourable,
IF I should now be silent, I should not know how to frame my self an excuse: Having heretofore beene a servant to the Right Honourable, the Earle of Bedford, & his Honorable friends in the drayning: And well observing how one Mr Hill who had then power put into his hands, did begin to go a wrong way to work upon Wisbeech River; which so soone as I perceived, I made it knowne, and al∣though
some money was expended that way by him before I could prevent it, yet I saved them a 1000. pounds; And can I now be silent? when by speaking I may not onely save 1000. but many thousands, in preventing the pursuance of a desperate dessgne, which the Honorable Committee for the Fens have ordered to be printed, that whosoever it concernes might make exceptions against it; silence in this case might give the Parliament and your Lordships just cause to approve thereof, which promise so faire, and to which none could take exceptions, though in∣vited to it. I have therefore with all faithfulnesse, briefly laid open the danger, which in all humility I present unto your Lordships, that the danger being discovered, which before lay hid under faire pro∣mises and prete may be avoided: And now whe∣ther these my  may here prove acceptable or no, I know not; Yet however, I have declared my opinion, and left it extant, that future times may witnesse that the danger was discovered. For my owne part I am confident, that if this designe be pur∣sued, what I have now written, one day by costly ex∣perience will be found to be true.
