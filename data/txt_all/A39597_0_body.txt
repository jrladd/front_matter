SIR,
WHen Mr. Boyle, with my Partners, and my
self attended your Majesty with the Ex∣periment
of Reducing Salt Water into
Fresh; your Majesty seem'd so well
pleas'd with an Invention of that Universal
Benefit, That We cannot but with our
Humblest Duty, acknowledge your Garcious Reception
of it; However as your Great Wisdom, and Judg∣ment
is not easie to be surpriz'd, and your Royal
Approbation never known to be your hasty Act of
Grace; your Favour and Patronage was not fully obtain'd,
till with the strictest Scrutiny you had first examin'd
those Hopes and Probabilities, you vouchsaf'd to En∣courage
in Us.

But when upon further consideration, We had obvia∣ted
all Difficulties, and salv'd all Objections against this
Undertaking, (which We hope will appear in this Printed
Paper,) your Majesty was Graciously pleas'd to give us
your Approbation, and to Order Us your Letters Patents,
which Grace and Favour, ought to be, and is receiv'd
by Us with the deepest sence of our humble Acknow∣ledgements
and Gratitude.
And if the Fruits of your Royal Grant has not hitherto
been deriv'd to Us, 'tis partly by some Obstacles we
met from the suggestions of a private Person, but more
especially by the late Horrid Conspiracy, when, not only
our Loyal apprehensions for your Majesties Danger, di∣verted
our Thoughts from all other Concerns, but like∣wise
we judg'd it a part of our Duty not to be pressing
on your Majesties Goodness, or on your Ministers of
State in so Important a juncture of Affairs: But having
now re-gain'd Leisure & Freedom after the dissipation
of the greatest part of our Fears, We presume a second
time to lay these Endeavours at your Feet, as best Enti∣tuled
to the Patronage of so great an Undertaking by
your own Subjects, and best able to Recommend it to
the World by your Royal Approbation.
This Experiment is in a great degree owing to
the Eminent Mr. Boyle, and indeed well worthy so

Ingenious a Promoter, being so much the more the
Favourite of his happy Genius, as it is Universally use∣ful
to Mankind; But what ever Advantages this Coun∣try,
or indeed the World may receive by it, his whole
ambition is bounded in the publick profit, contenting
himself with no other Benefit from it, than the satis∣faction
and pleasure of seeing it accomplish'd by his
Friends.
The Advantages in regard to Navigation, especially
in long Voyages, which are subject (through often
Calms, and on several other accounts,) to distress for
want of Water, and the benefits to Sea-Towns, which
are incommodated by Brackish Waters, Together with
the Easiness, Cheapness and Wholsomness of this pre∣pared
Water, are the principal scope of these ensuing
Papers, which are Humbly Dedicated to your Majesties
Perusal, Favour, and further Approbation by,
