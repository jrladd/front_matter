THe eternall God (blessed for ever) saying:Ier. 8.22.
Is there no Balme in Gilead? Is there no Physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? signifieth thereby, that as there is salve for corporall in∣firmitie; so is there likewise for spi∣rituall maladie. And therefore He that
hathMal. 4.2. healing in His wings, having pronounced,Mat. 9.12. , The sick have need of a Physician; hath taught there∣in, ThatIsa. 55.2,
3. endeavour should be for health in soule, Ut sit mens2 Tim. 1.7. sana in corpore sano. Also like as the Sentence saith concerning what is bodily,Sir. 38.4. ,
The Lord hath crea∣ted medicines out of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhorre them; so hath Hee out of his infinite wisdome brought forth his most holy word; and whatsoever
 his Servants publish for to further spirituall welfare, and being theProv. 1.8. true doctrine of the sacred Scripture, it should not be1 Thess. 5.20, 21. despised, butActs.
17.11. taken into due con∣sideration. It is a Saying among the Jewes,
 A man learneth not so much of his own self, as he learneth of another. OneBuxtorfius Lexico Chal∣daico Rabbini∣co ad radicem
 expresseth it, Non tantum valet studium privatum, quam id quod cum alio quis habet commune. The Almighty Creatour doth so1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10, 11, 25. powre out of his Spirit upon the Mysticall body of his Sonne (to Whom be honour and glory everlastingly) as that one member may make use of another, according to his holy ordinance. Moreover, whereas the wise mans Exhortation is,Sir. 38.1. , Honour the Physician; and having my selfe con∣sulted with you my much beloved neighbour and Phy∣sician for bodily infirmities, and by Gods blessing find∣ing much helpe and comfort from you; in mutuall love and thankefulnesse I offer unto you these Spiritu∣all counsels and soule-salves, praying that He, who is the true Tree of life, Whose leaves are for theRev. 22.2. healing of the Nations, may universally blesse them to you, yours, and all theGal. 6.16. Israel of God. And although some have (as the Apostle relateth)Acts. 28.27. refused to be healed; yet the HeavenlyEzek. 2.7. command was, Thou shalt speake my words unto them, whether they will heare, or whether they will forbeare. Also howsoever unto them, whichPhil. 3.19. Luke. 12.20, 21. 2 Tim.

One which inhabiteth eternity, whose Name is holy) there is hope that the greatest measure ofIsa. 30.26. Rom. 11.12, 15, 26. light therein, foretold in the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles to be given by God in the last Time, shall short∣ly be enjoyed;Nazianzenus oratione in lau∣dem Cypriani habita.
