Gentlemen,
TWO of the greatest, faithful∣lest,
and most intimate Friends
in the World, Reason and Conscience,
command me here in their Names,
courteously to salute and invite
you in.
They earnestly desire three or
four Hours serious and private con∣ference
with you about some very
important Personal Concerns of
yours, which cannot admit of deni∣al,
or long delay. And if you
make any trifling excuses, they have
commanded and instructed me here
to answer them.

In case of absolute and obstinate
refusal to hear them, they order me
to tell you, If you will not talk
with them now, they'll talk with you
shortly whether you will or no. If
you say, you are not now at leisure,
having other business to do; they
both desire you to consider, First,
You can have no Business in the
World of equal importance with
theirs. Secondly, That whatever o∣ther
lawful Affairs you are pursuing,
their Business with you will no way
obstruct, but greatly promote it.
And Lastly, That a greater Person
than any of you lost his Life by
pocketing up a Letter at Night,
saying, To morrow is a new Day; and
it proved to him indeed Des novissi∣ma,
his last Day, he losing by that
Neglect the only Opportunity of li∣ving
longer.
If you demand how your Reason
came to be bound up in this little
Book, and say, That which is Reason

to this Author, may be folly and
non-sense to you; I am bid to tell
you, you are obliged first to read and
compare, else your own Reason will
presently call it your own folly and
non-sense so to pronounce. Sound
Reason is uniform, and like it self
all the World over. Its true Laws
and Dictates equally oblige one, as a∣nother,
in like cases and circumstan∣ces.
If you say, there have been some
Jars and Disgusts betwixt you, and
your Reasons and Consciences; you
and they have fallen out so oft, that
you have no great fancy to come near
them in private, for you expect no∣thing
but harsh and chideing Lan∣guage
from them, and therefore are
fain by continual Diversions and
quick Successions of Business, to
maintain your Peace, by keeping at
as great a distance from them as you
can.

'Tis their desire you should here
know, First, That their debates
with you will be as calm and friend∣ly,
as they are seasonable and ne∣cessary.
Secondly, That they both
profess (and you may believe them)
they neither do, nor can design any
thing but your good. Thirdly, That
that Person is certainly in a very
bad Case, that cannot endure to
converse with himself. Fourthly,
That you herein deny a Civility to
your own Reasons and Conscien∣ces,
which you daily pay to Stran∣gers
and Inferiors. And in a
Word, that they desire a recon∣ciliation
with you, upon as fair
and honourable terms, as can well
be desired. And that this being
done, they will both stick faith∣fully
by you in all the troubles
and dangers of your Lives, and
follow you as your inseparable
Friends, into any thing but Sin.

If you say, This is but a Whee∣dle
to draw you into a Book, that
will make you melancholy, and
perhaps mad.
'Tis their Sense and Judgment,
that of all men living, you have
least reason to pretend the one or
the other in this Case. For they
are very confident you are now in
the most Melancholy circumstan∣ces
men can ordinarily be in on
this side Hell. And for Madness,
they desire to know what you
your selves would call that man,
that is running with such post∣haste
to Hell (as will not admit
of two or three hours stop upon
the Road) to prove himself to
be no Mad-man, but in his right
mind and wits?
Moreover, they command me to
inform you, It is their desire, that
seeing their debates with you will
neither be tiresome nor impertinent,
you will please to hear them out what

they have to say to you; and then
if you shall find cause to complain
that your Pleas and Excuses are not
fairly drawn, or that you have new
Matter to furnish a better Apology,
they are both content you shall
have your liberty to amend or add
what you please; and if they be not
able to refute them, they'll give you
no further trouble or interruption in
your course.
This, Gentlemen, is what I have
in charge to say to you in the Porch;
and now if you please, the Door is
open; you may be as private as you
will. They'll attend you to your
Bed-chamber or Closet; and I hear∣tily
wish an happy issue to this friend∣ly
debate.
