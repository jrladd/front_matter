generousnesse of your minde, that make me desirous, to consecrate something t the memory of your Name; for thoug your owne vertue will preserve it suffi∣ciently, yet my affection is not satisfied without bearing a part in it: that be∣ing my selfe but a whithered bough; may expresse my joy, in so flourishing branch of our Family, as your selfe is▪ And now, I know not whether I ma account you young, in regard of your fer yeares: or Old, in regard of your muc experience: having spent Twelve year together, (a longer time then Vlysses in travelling over the most flourishing parts of Christendome; where ha∣ving spent your time, in so noble  manner as Report delivers; you can∣not chuse but be returned home, Vir pau corum hominum; more compleat in good parts, then to have man Peeres. But to leave this  Having heretofore written Meditati∣ons
upon the Lords Prayer: J have now adventured to doe the like upon the Creede; which Treatise, as J Dedicate to your Name; so my selfe, to your Service; and remaine
Devoted to you, in all true Love and Affection,
