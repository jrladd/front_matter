ALthough there can be no reendship (right Honorable and my singuler good Lord) to speak properly whee there is no equallitie between the pa ties, yet may the simplest and the meanest looue and honor the highest and gratest, yea so much the more as their inequallitie is the greater. But that is not properly cal∣led freendship but rather a dutifull looue and is harde to be ex∣pressed and shewed for the inequalitie aforesaid. For Feendship is between equalls, or at the least where the inequalliti is not so very great that the Offices and duties of Freendship which are the bondes and sinewes therof can haue no entercours. I speak this for my self that haue long desired occasion to she my har∣tie goodwil and affection vnto your Lordship which hath been somewhat hard for me to doo for the cause abooue remembred. And therfore hauing gathered this little conference: I ade bold to dedicate it vnto my good Lord. A thing meeter to b my gift then woorthy to be presented vnto your Honor or to go further vnder the name of such a Patron. Howbeit, my trust is hat your Lordship of your accustomed clemency will accept a simple thing of him at whose hands nothing at al was looked for, and will alowe my good will towards the reparation of such faults and Imper∣fections as are heerin.
So praying God to blesse your Lordship and prs∣per you.
From London the twentie six of Nouember. 1579.
