Humbly shewing,
THat the Charge of your Majesties Subjects in the main∣tenance of the Poor, by Assessements, in the several Pa∣rishes of your Majesties Kingdome of England and Dominion of Wales, is conceived to amount unto above Six Hundred Thousand Pounds per an. besides all Free gifts, Almes houses, and other Benevolencies given towards their maintainance; which sum being levied at one entire Sessement, together with their other Free gifts & Revenues, and many other gifts which would be given, if your Majesties Subjects were sure the Poor should be set on work and provided for with it, and the Trade of Fishing already graciously propounded by your Majestie, and other things in your Petitioners Book were

enacted and put in execution, would undoubtedly set all the Poor on work, and in a small time wholly ease your Maje∣sties Subjects of their Taxes, in maintaining them in idlenesse, and the profit of their work will amount to more then their Taxes, by which means the Fishing Trade will be more ad∣vanced, your Majesties Sea-men and shipping have more necessaries and employment, your Majesties Seas more guarded and strengthned, your Merchants would have more Trade and encouragement, your Majesties Customes and Revenues much more encreased, all your Subjects more benefited, besides a sufficient maintenance for the Poor in all Counties.
All which might be fully accomplished if this work of the Poor were effectually put in execution.
That your Majestie would be graciously pleased to con∣sider the neglect and oppression of the Poor, and how ma∣ny of other Nations lives here and eats the bread out of your Poor Subjects mouthes, and how strict they are o∣ver all Strangers under their Government, not suffering them to work as Masters but as Slaves who under them live.
That your Majestie would be pleased to pardon your poor Petitioner in presuming to present these rude Lines unto your Majestie.
