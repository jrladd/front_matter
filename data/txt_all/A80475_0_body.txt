Madam,
MY Gratefull Purposes long since engaged to your Ladyships service, were never yet so Advantaged by op∣portunity, as to make
the World the wit∣nesse of their since∣rity.
Difficult and per∣plexed times, occasi∣on too much neglect of duty, and make place for pardon. This little Book, and small Comment upon one of the greatest Books in the world, (where∣of I humbly present you with the Dedi∣cation) hath nothing to commend it up so
high as your hands, but the weight of the Subject, and the sim∣ple integrity of the Author, obliged not more to the memory of your dear Father (my very good Lord and Patron, of unde∣filed hands) then to your own merits and excellencies, whereof I had once the ho∣nour to be an unwor∣thy Servant, and have still the duty to be an
observer and admi∣rer.
As for my self I must know who I am, but for this thing here in hand, I may wish it laid to heart, for a Jewel is a Jewel though wrapt up in plain leather, or in brown paper.
Now that the God whom you serve in your spirit and Fami∣ly, would in blessing
blesse you in all your Relations; and that the same God who hath so begun to glorifie you in those graces wherewith he hath enriched your soule, (making you an eminent and un∣feigned example of Goodnesse, even in this Age) will also Perfect and Crowne these graces with Glory: Is the
Prayer of,
Madam,
