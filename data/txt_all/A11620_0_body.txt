RIGHT HONORABLE,
ALthough many power∣full motiues haue gi∣uen wings to my bold∣nesse, to beg that my ill tilld Tillage may bee enclosed by the hedge of your Honours Protection; yet the chiefest reason is, that your innate Wisedome and Boun∣tie-polished by the Theoricke practise, and loue of Learning, values reall good meaning, aboue greater showes of
 fawning flattery, or affected curiositie.
I doe but set a Candle before the Sunshine of your exquisite knowledge in the true Diuine and Philosophicall Elixir; but sith what I haue done, is as well to shew my ambition, to haue your Honourable approbation, as to bee a Symboll of my zeale to your seruice: If it please your Honour to pardon my zeale, you may iustly condemne my a∣spiring ayme, whose prematured La∣bours soares so high, as giue Cogni∣zance to the world, that as I am, I shall euer continue
