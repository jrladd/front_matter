Madam,
THere being but two
sorts of persons fit
for the Patronage of
such a Book, the Great, and

the Good; as I have for many
Reasons declined the first
so I know my Choice of th
second to be so Judicious by
dedicating this to your Self
that I dare adventure to af∣fix
my Name to it, which 
have not done to many o∣thers.
I will not let loose
my Pen to launch into your
just Praise, lest it be look'd
upon as Interest, or Flatte∣ry;
besides, Virtue and
Goodness ever carry their
own Commendations, as
their own Reward, with

them. This piece is one of
the noblest Reliques of An∣iquity
that ever was trans∣ferr'd
to us. A learned Au∣thor
calls it a Heaven full of
Asterismes, a Body full of
Eyes, in which if there be a∣ny
Defect, it is the too ma∣ny
Beauties crowded toge∣ther,
and like a Banquet of
Sweet-Meats must be tasted
at Intervals, lest it prove o∣ver
lushious and cloy, and
one thing impare the Relish
of the other, though each be
exquisite in its self. This,

though but Paper, may perpe∣tuate
your Name beyond the
duration of Monuments of
Marble, or Porphiry, for the
Apophthegmes of the An∣cients
shall last till time shall
be no more, and may your
Memory live so too. All I
shall add, is, Madam, to de∣sire
you would forgive the
Weaknesses I may be guilty
of in this, or any other thing
relating to your self, and
that you would believe it a
great truth (which I expose
to the Worlds Contradicti∣on

if otherwise) that I am
unfeignedly, and without a∣ny
mental Reservation,
Madam,

York Garden, this 20th. of Ianuary 1683.
