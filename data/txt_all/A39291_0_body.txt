Great Sir,
THE Kingdom of God, the Subject of these en∣suing Meditations, I humbly crave leave to present to Your Majesties Acceptance, Peru∣sal and Consideration, as containing matter of the greatest weight and worth to Your Self, and to Your Three Kingdoms; my unfeigned hearty desire, confi∣dence and comfort concerning You is, that You will pursue to Your utmost Power, this great Command, Counsel and Proclamation of Your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in seeking first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness: And that by Your Example, Command, Counsel, and Pro∣clamation  also endeavor that all under Your Care and Charge may do in like manner, it being the great end of our coming into the World, living in it, and dying out of it, next to the Glory of God, to enjoy a bet∣ter, namely, this Kingdom of God: For which end and
 purpose our Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks are made to Almighty God for You, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all godliness and honesty; for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the Truth; which if You, and those in eminent place under You, may be instrumental of, how greatly will it add to Your Crown and Joy! For what is Your Hope or Joy, or Crown of Glorying and Rejoycing, are not even we Your Subjects, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming, to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because that Your Command, Counsel, Proclamation, Example and Charge to every one of us (as a Father to his Chil∣dren) to walk worthy of God, who hath called us to this Kingdom and Glory, was believed, obeyed and followed in that day:) Wherefore also we pray alwayes for You, and for all that are in Authority both Ecclesiastical and Civil, that God would count and vouchsafe both You and us wor∣thy of this Calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his Goodness, and the work of Faith with power, that the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in You, and we in Him, according to the Grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom I am, and ever shall be
