Great Sir,
TO undertake to inform your Iudgement, how pertinaciously
Malitious, how pestilently Reproachful, how impudent∣ly
Dissatisfied and implacably Cruel Men listed in the
Rowls of Faction are, were to say, That your Royal
Father, and Brother, and your self, High Prince, never felt the
sharpness of those Vulters Claws, nor disgusted the Poyson of those
Asps. But in regard of the Danger of permitting an Execrable
Brood to live to maturity for mischief, each private Man is (as it
seems to me) obliged to detect them▪ Grace and Clemency in their

infest all others with bloodsheding. May it please you, Great
Prince, favourably to admit this Reason for the Publication of these
Papers, and this Apology for a Suffering Church-mans most humble
Tender of them to your most Iudicious Observation; That, As I
judged the Imposers, and what hath been imposed upon me ought not to
be longer concealed, so neither can I expect remedy by private Means, and
have therefore recourse to the Royal Fountain. I would gladly pass
the rest of my Days in tranquility, (if God be pleased to permit it▪)
and should most unwillingly see other well-meaning Persons ashamed of
their Duty through my Cause. To prevent which I am prostrate before
you, beseeching your Mediation for and Protection of
