YOu sacred Nymphes, which haunt Pernassus Hill,
Where Soron flowes, and Demthis run at will:
Out from your two-topt Valley shew me grace
And on the lower Listes meete mee apace.
Infuse in me the Veine, I gladlie craue,
To sing the sadde FAREWELS my SOYLE must haue.
And yee Supreames of this poore MUSE of mine,
As Iudges justlie censure this Propine:
I bring no Stones from Pactole, Orient Gemmes,
Nor Bragges of Tagus, singes of Golden Stemmes:
I search not Iris, square-spread clowdie VVinges,
Nor of the strange Herculian Hydra singes,
These Franticke Fansies, I account as vaine,
In Vulgare Verse, my FAREVVELS I explaine.
If I debord in Stropiate Lines, or then
In Methode faile, attache my wandring Pen.
This Veine of Nature, and a Mother VVit,
Is more than haughtie Schollers well can hit.
So this small Fondling, borne of your nine VVombes,
Turnes backe, and in your Bosome her intombes.
Then nurse your Youngling, and repurge her Veines,
And sende her backe in haste, to yeelde mee Gaines.
In doing this, to you, and to your Fame,
I consecrate my Loue, and her new Name.
