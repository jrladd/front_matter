MADAM,
AS soon as Nature had awaked my Duty in the tender of its Devotion to Lucinda, I was prompted by Justice, as well as Love, to lay my next Offering at Your Feet, because I must avow to all the World, that nothing hath that Ascendant over my Soul as Ye Two have, who make my Passions high, yet honest; Ye are Twin-Stars of the first Mag∣nitude, so that I cannot shew Ye my Respects, without advancing my Religion, Your Piety encouraging that unto some nobler Effort, while it instructs these in the most decent and humble ways of submitting my Desires to Heaven's acceptance first, and then to Your Graces.
Madam, You know I never yet approach'd You but with a Prayer, or with Musick, (admiring the Divinity which still arrays Your Person;) the Imitation of your Holy and Harmonious Mind, I think, is Work for the most Excellent upon Earth, as the Admira∣tion
of it is my chiefest pleasure, and hath been the cause of pub∣lishing these the Essays of my younger time, (began about twenty years ago at my entrance into Your Service) when I aim'd at nothing but God's Grace, and Yours.
Madam, The intent of my first Affections would palliate their weaker Actings, since (as the strength of Zeal may still excuse some Errors) the Daughter of Time is here with a Gift, though the Daughter of Tyre be not in her Robes: Here is no gentile Vanity, or curious Texture of Wit; no Colours of Rhetorick, nor modish Points of Courtship, to inveigle Your Opinion of the pre∣sent.

Yet, Madam, here is that, may well become Your Grace,
The most Angelike Dress, in fashion upon Earth;
The way to pierce the Skies, with Orisons and Praise;
The way to pass our Lives, in truest Ease, and Mirth.

I wish You like the making up of this Suit (as it is) with the truth of his Devotion and Service, who is ready to wait upon You (in his Holy-day habit) both to Your Closet, and to Our Church, as
MADAM,
