ALL thoghe sence the ty∣me thari was a childe / i haue ben more broght up in learnyng then in hun¦tyng / & haue therfore no great skil or experience in huntyng / yit the loue that i bear unto my natural cuntrey compelleth me at thys tyme (most ex¦cellent & uictorious Prince) to be a hunter / to hunt & fynde out a certayn cruel beste / whych both hath don et dothe yit still mich harm in yo¦ur reaml & kyilleth both yong & old all that he can cum by. Thys beste hathe lost hys mame in englond but neuer a Dele of hys cruel conditio¦nes. Thys self beste haue ye ernestly gon about n Word Wrytyng & Workyng as myche as one man is able to do to dryue out of your realme. But the hundes that ye set to do thys dede. Was and ar / of the same kynde & linage that the wild best is of therfor they bark at hym for a
 face but they bite not. They make a praetence as they wold worri hym / & yit when he is in iepe∣rdy of takyng they help to couer hym wyth tame bestes skinnes / that the prouerb may haue a pla¦ce on dog will not eat of an other dogges fleshe nether will ō wolf eat of an other. Thes houn∣des loue thys best so well that if they can catche any other hoūd persewyng hym whiche is / of an other kynde then they be of / that is to wit if he haue not a payr of prik eares standyng up / on before & an other behynde / they will neuer rest til they se the other houndes harte blode. they tēdre thys best so interly and wold so fayn haue hym vnknowen / for fere that your Hyghnes shuld kill hym if he were knowē / that they bea∣re all men in hand that theyr is no such beste in all your realm & ponyshe them with many kyn¦des of dethe that dare say that theyr is any su∣che best in engloud. But if ye will of your Kyn∣gly liberalite grant me licens to call all that the pope hath made / ordened / & decreed / the popes traditiones ordinances and decrees / i shall so hunt out thys best et discouer hym that all your hole realme may spy hym and se hym and know hym what he is / what is hys name / and where he lurketh Thys once brought to pas it shall be more easy for your hyghnes to accomplish and bryng to pass your godly purpos / whych is and euer hathe ben senc ye knew hys conditiones / to dryue thys beast out of all places of your domi∣nion.
 I desyre also your kyngly hyghnes that ye wil not suffer thys my doyng to be cōdemned of the bisshoppes / till your oun lerned discretiō ha∣ue tryed it & examined it with the word of god & with the lyght of your reason and learnyng / and then if my huntyng be found contrari to the word of god / so soun as ye fynd it so / let my huntyng be forbydden / et not before i be seche yow for the loue of the kyng of heuen whyche / saue and kepe yow from all your enemies both bodely & gostly Amen. From basil the first day of may. Anno domini 1543.
