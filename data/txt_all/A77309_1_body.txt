IN my Youth, from others in your parts, and in mine Age from you, have my weak hands been strength∣ned in the Lord. If to any Trades∣man, that will use serious and spiri∣tual Meditation, these poor Papers be useful, I shall (if the Lord will give me leave) present something more on this Subject. I humbly beg your Acceptance of this slender To∣ken of my Love and Thankfulness, and a blessing on yours; as also on all that shall vouchsafe these sheets a reading, is begged, by,
Dear Sirs,
