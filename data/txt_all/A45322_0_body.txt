TO thee only, O my God, who hast put these holy Thoughts into my soule, doe I most humbly desire to Dedicate both my selfe and them; Earnestly beseeching thee graciously to accept of both: And that thou wouldst be pleased to ac∣company and follow these

my weak practicall De∣votions, with a sensible blessing in every Reader. Let these good Meditati∣ons not rest in the eie, but descend into the Bosome of the Perusers: and effe∣ctually worke in their Hearts, that warmth of pious Affections, which I have here presumed to exemplifie in mine; To the glory of thy great Name, and our mutuall comfort, in the day of the glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus. Amen.
