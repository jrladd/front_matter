SIR,
YOur Piety, your Learning, your Patronage to both, have encouraged me to be∣queath this Peece to you. Though I cannot merit you a Maecaenas to mee, the truth may to it.

Paul seeing the Idolatry of the A∣thenians, his spirit, ,Act. 17.16.  He was much greiv∣ed in his spi∣rit. Arab. Stirred with anger. was bitterly pro∣voked. And the dumbe Daughter of Crassus spake, when she saw her Fathers life in danger. I could not hold my peace, nor can you with∣hold your approbation, to cry downe that diabolicall Astrologie which is practi∣sed by some, in these all-evill times (in sorts of sins) to the great prejudice of truth and godlinesse. Myriads of men, of late, have degenerated by many Mis∣creant degrees of declension. This last of turning to Daemonologie, as to a Divinitie, leaving God, for the De∣vill, is worst of all. Atheisme (too fre∣quent) is worst regatively, this posi∣tively;
and therefore in that, worse then that worst. How justly I speake all this, will appeare, when this Treatise hath made report. And had I made knowne to the Parliament, all I know of some Astrologers late practises, possibly they might make a Law against Astro∣logers, as the Roman Senate did.Vlpian, l. 7. De officio Pro∣consulis. I will interrupt you no lon∣ger, but still remaine,

From my Study at Mary Staynings, London, October. 28. 1650.
