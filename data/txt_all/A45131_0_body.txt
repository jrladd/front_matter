SEeing Dedications are become Customary, I will choose me a Patron for this Book, as a Papist chooses his Saint. He fancies such a one will be Propitious to his Affairs, and addresses himself to him in his Prayers, but knows not whether he hears him or no. The Person whom I choose to make this Dedication to, shall be the Honourable Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, whom I know not, nor he me in the least. If he did, this would be Flattery, which now is Adventure; and might be but a Blurr, which now is Honour. I do fancy that Person to be an impartial perspicacious Gentleman, and that he will therefore like the Honesty and Innocency of these Sheets. I do Fancy, that as it is hard to find a Pa∣rallel to him in sufficiency for his Province, so it is not easy (in the circumstances Speakers are) to have a Man in the Chair of more Integrity (or natural Byass) to the Pub∣lick Good; and so far as I know, to the Protestant Cause. I do fancy that he will not therefore in good earnest turn off any seasonable well-digested Motion (if any be tendred in the House) for Moderation in the business of Religion. I do think him verily a man Unconcern'd for the Non∣conformists,
but not Malicious to Good People; and though Portly, not so High as to be Offended at a Mean mans good Conceit of him. I am perswaded, that in my sphear, I cannot put a greater Dignity upon him (if he serves our End) than by the peculiarity of such a Dedication. If he deceives me, and proves one that designes any thing Evil, and not the best things for the Church of God, let him answer it to the Almighty: He shall be no longer my Patron on Earth, nor Saint in Heaven.
