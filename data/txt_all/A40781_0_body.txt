My Lord,
HAving Writ a few Sheets, to lay open the Incertainty of
Cypher; and Decy∣phering, being an Art consecrate to the
Occasions of Princes, I do Hum∣bly prefix your Lordships name to
them: The thing is designed for His Maje∣sties Service, and
that gives His Secre∣tary a good Title to it: But my Lord I had other Motives
for this my Pre∣sumption, besides your Eminent Stati∣on; I mean, the
more Eminent Adhe∣rence of your Noble Family, to the In∣terests of
the Crown; at a time when he was accounted the only Traytor, that
dared not commit Treason. His late Majesty of ever Blessed
Me∣mory, and Judgment, next to infal∣lible, had so much
Confidence in the Conduct of your late Father; That he gave him the command of
that Army in the Hills, which then only appeared for his Majesties
Interest, and might have been the means to restore Him, had not
Providence suited a Bloodless Restauration to a Gentle
Reign, tho Rebel's Blood stains not. And when His
Majesty, was Miraculously settled upon the Throne of his Ancestors; He
first chose the Earl of Middleton, out of all His Loyal Subjects
in his Anci∣ent Kingdom, immediately to Repre∣sent Him, as His
Commissioner; the next Representation of Majesty it self a
Subject is capable of: And His Lordship died bearing part of that Sacred
Image, as Governor of Tangier. This leads me to your Lordship, and I
have the Authority of Custom, to go on, for De∣dications are generally
Panegyricks, and Authors either find, or make their Patrons singular; But I
forbear, be∣cause, tho' I should say nothing, but
Truths, within the small reach of my own Knowledg; as I might
exceed, the Belief of Strangers, so I must come short, of the
Expectation of all, who know your Lordship: And as the Subject treated of,
(for the most part) lies out of the common Road, so the manner of this
Address to your Lord∣ship is Suitable; having here so far shun'd the
Imputation of Flattery, that I designedly shade evident Truths,
while others Blazon Palpable Forma∣lities.
And now my Lord, though I De∣dicate the following Observations
to your Lordship, I hope none can fansie that the Defects, under
what Desig∣nation soever may reflect upon you, I know it is a
Critical Age, and Cri∣ticks have much of the Venom and Na∣ture of Wasps,
often observed, to make Sores where there are none to fix upon. But their
Ignorance, as well as Malice is sufficiently ridiculous, that do not lay the
Faults of this, whether Real, or Imaginary, entirely
at my own Dore; and there is Ground enough to throw them on: Let all, be
imputed to want of years, or Judgment; and let this hum∣ble Address,
be call'd want of Discretion; Nay there are plenty of
WANTS: But I HAVE an intire Inclination, to serve my King
and Country; and if this small Tract, at this time, do in any Mea∣sure
Evidence it, I HAVE my aim, and let it remain upon record
to my per∣petual Infamy, if I do not chearful∣ly, and upon all occasions
venture the last drop of my Blood in His Majesties Service; and according
to the Circum∣stances, Act of Suffer for one infinitly
BETTER than the GOOD OLD CAUSE. And next to the Royal
Interest, I declare, That my great Ambition in particular, is to
be,
My Lord,
