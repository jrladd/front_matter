Right Honourable,
THE great Councell of Ierusalem
sate neare the Temple,R. Sol. in Ex. 21 and the
greatest managings of the Councell,Luke 2. 46.
were the matters of Religion.Talm. in Sanhed. cap. Dine. mam∣monoth. Such
hath been the posture of your desires,
and such the bent of your indea∣vours
in all your sitting: And as it is ingratitude in
any degrees of men not to serve you, who strive so much
to preserve the State, so especially is it in the Ministers
of the Temple, since you labour so much also to serve the
Temple. Obedience to your commands is the lowest ex∣pression
of such a service, because it is so naturally due,
yet is it the highest that my meannesse can reach unto;
Readinesse being joyned to that obedience: These are

the two mites that I can tender unto your Corban, and
the two Turtles that I have to offer at your Altar, not
having a better or more valuable gift and offering to
bring, your Noblenesse will please to accept of the gift
because of the heart of the giver given with it, and like
him whom yee represent, to account. To obey, to be
better then Sacrifice, and to hearken, better then
the fat of Rams. What in obedience to your command
was humbly presented to your eares and hearing not long
agoe, is now upon the like command in the same obedi∣ence
and humility presented to your eyes and reading. If
it shall finde acceptance with you, it secureth me a¦gainst
al thought or care of inferiors displeasure or excep∣tions.
I most humbly and submissively cast it, my selfe,
and all that I am or can at the feete and disposall of your
honourable House: and because short discourse best fit∣teth
your great occasions, cease to trouble you with more
words: but shall never cease to solicite the Throne of
grace for continued defence and blessing upon your per∣sons
and indeavours; that the Law-giver may never
faile till Shiloh come as we desire amongst us: And so
ever prayeth,
