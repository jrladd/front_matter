May it please your Grace,
BY condescending favourably to accept this Discourse, when published, to promote the great End for which it was at first compos'd: That of exciting Piety and Charity, in a Society particularly happy in your Grace's presiding over it. A Society bless'd with a Succession of Reverend and Religious Prelates; but never more signally so, than now, that Your Grace hath been pleas'd to take it into your pecu∣liar Care. The Eminent Station You have most de∣servedly attained in the Church, is our Honour and Privilege: And the Lustre of so bright an Example is both a Pattern to Ʋs, and a powerful Induce∣ment to All who are disposed to do us Good. The Members of this Body will be exceedingly to blame, if They shall neglect to imitate (so far as their respe∣ctive Capacities permit) the Virtues of their Head; and Others, in whom Mine or better Arguments may
 move Compassion to the Distress'd Relicts of the Cler∣gy, will now no longer be able to excuse themselves, by the too common Pretence of having their Charity stifled or mis-employ'd.
The Account of our Distributions for several Years past, is purposely annexed to this Sermon, that the World may be convinced, how unjustly this Objection is at any time urged against Ʋs; and Your Grace's known Vigilance, and prudent Zeal in Matters of this Nature are an absolute Security against its being so much as pretended, while You have the Inspection of Ʋs.
For this Reason, My Lord, when I found my self obliged to commit this Sermon to the World, I pre∣sumed to endeavour the making it yet more serviceable to my Brethren, by begging the Recommendation of Your Grace's Patronage. Though not for this Reason only, since it gives me at the same time an Occasion of thankfully acknowledging Your Grace's Favour to my self: Which I shall always study to preserve, and ex∣press a due Sense of, as well by my hearty Prayers, that Your Grace may long continue a Publick Blessing to this Church and Nation, as by my constant Care to approve my self in all possible Instances of Duty and Respect,
My Lord,

Dec. 13. 1697.
