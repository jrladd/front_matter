SIR,
YOU have very much honoured me in the choice of an Opponent: but I perceive by his Conclusion that he hath other business, and I am not altogether with∣out. And therefore I intreat you the next time to choose me an Adversary that differs from me, or to give me leave to live at Peace. Or if he differ not, let him rather reprehend me for agreeing with him, than pretend a difference where there is none. If your learned Friend do think it as well worth his labor to prove us disagreed, as I thought it worth mine to prove us of a mind, if I live I shall be willing to read what he rejoyns; but if it come not of a greater Errand; I'le promise you no more. As to your own pious Labors, they are so honest and savory to me, that they tempted me to differ from you in one thing, and to think that [an Hypocrite cannot write or preach as well as a good Christian can] there being an unexpressible Spiritua∣lity that I savour in some men more thenothers: but
 I'le not stand to this. You give at least as much to the Hypocrite I think as ever I did; and you confirm it by much Scripture-evidence. But I must confess I thnk not that all your Notes of sincerity are exact or will hold the Tryal; but ye they be usefull in many Cases. You affirm that Hypocrites have common Grace, even to the height expressed by you: but you say, It is not true Grace. Either its Grace or no Grace: if none, call it not common Grace, (or com∣mon Faith, Desire, Hope, Love, Joy; if it be none.) But if it be Grace, and not true Grace, then Ens & Verum non convertuntur. I maintain that it is not true saving Grace, but yet true common Grace: You maintain in the general that it is not true Grace, and yet its truly common Grace: There being then no Controversie that I see to be disputed between you and me, but whether Ens & Verum convertuntur, I crave pardon for my further silence, resolving rather to give you the best (though not to assent) than to dispute it: I remain
