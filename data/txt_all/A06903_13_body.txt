THere is nothing more preiuditiall to the life of man then an vnlearned Phisition, nor no vilder member belonging to the stable then an vnskilfull Farryer, whence it comes, that I haue beene more precisely carefull to perfit this booke, with the truest plainenes, & the easiest demonstrations that I coulde anie way fashion, be∣cause for the most part, you Smithes are Maisters of little more then Natures learning, so that should I haue writ as former Au∣thors haue written, questionlesse as formerly you haue doone, so still you should continue in amaze and error, the effects of your practise hauing onely the ground of custome, and not of reason: this to preuent, and that you may giue a true account for whatsoeuer you shall administer, I haue layed downe euerie effect, euery face, and figure of euery infirmitie, so plainely, & so accompanied it with vndoubted truths, that if you will but either heare or read, and intreat your memories to retaine what you shall haue deliuered. I doubt not but you shall both com∣mend your expence of time, thanke me for my trauell, pleasure those which shall neede you, and maintaine your places with good reputation: howsoeuer this I know, that for as much as I haue set downe nothing beyond my knowledge, therefore I haue done nothing to which I cannot giue the account of rea∣son, therefore if you accept it kindly, it is my loue well imploy∣ed, if otherwise, it is not lost, for I did not intend it for those which are vngratefull.
