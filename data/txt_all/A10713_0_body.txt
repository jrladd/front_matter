MOst Honorable, and most worthie Earle, the
seuerall Bookes that are spread, bearing the
names and Titles of Histories, of summaries of
Chronicles, & of diuers other collections drawn
from vnworthy Authors: some of them printed,
some otherwise published here in Ireland, by Papists, by lieng
Chroniclers, by idle Poets, by Bardes and Irish Rythmers,
all of them conteining matter of vntruth: As the memories
of superstitious foundations, lies and Fables, foolishly medled
and compacted togither: written rather in the maintenance
and fauour of lewd misdemeanor, of Superstition, of Idolatry,
and do rather giue encouragement to wicked Subiects to en∣ter
the field of Rebellion, to take Armes against the Prince,
to disobey, to contemn, to despise, not onelie the Princes lawes,
and his Maiesties gracious proceedings, but also setting o∣pen
the wide gate that leadeth to many misdemeanors against
the Prince himselfe. I haue therefore thought it a matter
much importing his Maiesties seruice, to do my best endeuor
to stop this gap thus broken downe, that thus openeth the way
to the wastfull spoile of Rebellion, of Treason, of Superstition,
of Idolatrie, of Disobedience, of Contempt: and to giue a

Booke to the well-disposed of that Realme of Ireland, where∣in
they may behold that truth, which they themselues haue
heard with their eares, haue seene with their eies, and are a∣ble
to testifie vpon dailie experience.
These lines thus squared out, I durst not presume to pre∣sent
to your Honor, in respect of anie abilitie that I acknow∣ledge
to be in my selfe, I knowe there can come nothing from
me, that may be anie waies answerable to your exquisit iudg∣ment
or worthinesse: but it is your owne vertue, your owne
affabilitie and Noble disposition, that was yet neuer knowne
to despice or discountenance any mans endeuours, that were
honestlie intended, or vndertaken to a good end and purpose.
It is this, your Honorable inclination, that hath encou∣raged
me: this is it hath made me to presume of a fauorable
acceptance. To you therefore, and to your honor alone, I haue
in most humble and submissiue manner, bequeathed those ex∣periments,
which forty yeares obseruation hath taught me to
know. To your Honor, whose exquissite iudgment is best able
to discerne, and whose wisdome and knowledge is most fitting
to redresse: by whose Honorable care for the good of the com∣mon-weale,
England and Ireland, are both made happie. By
whose prouidence and wisdome (next vnder his Maiestie) we
haue hitherto reaped the fruits of a most happie and blessed
gouernment. To your Honor therefore, I submit my labors,
my Loue, my lines, my seruice, my selfe, my endeuors, & all
that I haue, to be at your Honors dispose: and thus will rest
to praie for your Honour, that GOD would still continue his
blessinges vpon you, as hitherto he hath done.
