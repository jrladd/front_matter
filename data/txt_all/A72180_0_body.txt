SIr, this Sermon was preached at Paules Crosse the 30. of Maye laste, at the which ther were some that gathered the same in writing so neere as they could, their coppies being conferred and laid to∣gether, were (neuerthelesse) found very imperfect, so that the Prea∣cher was requested to perfecte the same so neere as his memorie would
 suffer him, the which hauing doone and the coppie comminge to my handes, J haue by publicke autho∣ritie printed it, I hope to the good of manie. And findinge my selfe greatlie indebted to your worshippe and yours for many curtesies, J was bolde to present it vnto you as a te∣stimonie of my thankeful minde, ho∣ping that you will accept the same in as good part as I meant it. And so beseechinge God to blesse your worshippe to the fulfillinge of that hope which many conceiue of you in time to come, I humblye take my leaue this 7. of August. 1591.
