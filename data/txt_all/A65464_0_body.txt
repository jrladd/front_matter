THE great Cowley forgets not to ac∣knowledge
his Master's Care and
Kindness while at Westminster; nor,
to come nearer, was Mr. Creech much tar∣dier
in publishing his grateful Resentments
of the same Obligations from Mr. Curganven.—You
may, Sir, justly wonder what makes
me drag in such Names into a Piece where
there is hardly like to be besides, one word
of Earnest, and perhaps not many of Sence:
You may be apt to judge me worthy not
much less Punishment than that Comoedi∣an
who stole matter from the Sacred Hi∣story
to patch up his Farce. But here I
must unavoidably take Refuge at the old
thumb'd Scrap, Sic parvis componere magna—Or,
to be more sincere; this seem'd a pret∣ty
way of beginning; I was fond of the
Fancy, and knew not where to get a better.
However, tho' I ha' been bold enough to
make the Similie, I hardly dare be so saw∣cy,

I mean o' my side, to apply it; nor,
tho' Mr. D—may be as noble a Field for
Panegyric as any, venture to disgrace him
with prefixing here his Name, or my little
Praises. 'Tis enough that all who knew me
when under his Tuition, know what a fair
share I enjoy'd of his undeserved Favours;
and that all who know so many famous
Men as have had the happiness of their Edu∣cation
there, are satisfy'd 'tis my own fault
I ha'n't made suitable Proficiency to what
might be rationally expected from such an
advantageous Foundation.—As to my ad∣dressing
these to you, though I can have no
full Excuse, yet my Presumption or Vanity
may admit, I hope, some Alleviation. This
is my first form'd Birth, of which, tho' ge∣nerally
partaking all the Parent's ill hu∣mours,
the greatest part of the World uses
to be, if not most fond, yet most concern'd;
and no wonder therefore, abstracting from
its Value or Defects, I am willing to pro∣vide
for it, and prefer it, But tho' Grati∣tude
commanded you should know the Au∣thor,
and that exact Respect he is still ob∣lig'd
to pay your former goodness; yet 
was too conscious of the mean way I testi∣fy'd
it in, and the unworthiness of the Ac∣knowledgment,
and had too tender a sense o
your Reputation, to let your name publick∣ly

appear here, before I knew what Recep∣tion
these true Trifles might find in the
World. The most, the best, the all I can
say for 'em, is what I remember many a
fair year past on such a kind of occasion:—Accept
my Heart for Gift, and all,
which will be the highest Honour can be
pretended to by,
Sir,
