MADAM,
I hauing bin en∣treated by a vvor∣thy gentleman, to reueivv this abstract of a greater history, to the end it might passe to pu∣blique

vse; And finding (accor∣ding to my slender skill in forraine tongues) that it pun∣ctually agreeth vvith the Frēch, out of vvhich it vvas transla∣ted into our vulgar: and iud∣ging the subiect proper to our times, vvherein (as alvvayes) ex∣amples moue more then do∣ctrine to actes of piety: I vvas Zealous to further the presse, annecting an Appendix or ad∣ioynder of mine ovvne poore conceits, as I hope, not vnpro∣fitable to the Reader. VVhich done, I easily resolued to begge your Lapps Patronage of so pious a designe, especially this

great Princesse, vvhose exem∣plar life is here abbreuiated, being one of the first branches of that spirituall tree of Sera∣phicall S. Francis, vnder vvho∣se shadovves you haue bin, and are vertuously conducted, in a penitentiall vvay to your great home; vvhere, by the infinite merits of our blessed Sauiour, you hope to enioy the revvard of your vertues, vvith other great personages of your fami∣ly, vvho haue humbly passed their pilgrimage vnder the same rule, not vvithout note of sanctitie. I omit my ovvne titles of obligation, vvhich chal∣lenge

both my pen & person in all duty to your Lapp. beg∣ging of the diuine goodnes, vvho is the butt of your acti∣ons, his blessing to all your good desires.
MADAM
