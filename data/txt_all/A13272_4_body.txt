SIR,
IUST promises are just debts, and debts (though delayed) ever come acceptably, if they come with advantage. I long since promised you a transcript of this Sermon (which was the Principall) and now I send it you with a Dedication (which is the Interest;) and such an Interest, I presume, you will not refuse, though presented by the hand of your poore Servant. Now it is yours indeed, but it is yours chiefly to peruse, not to protect; for such a subject will looke above all humane
 Patronage, there being nothing fit either to owne or protect Omnipotence, but GOD himselfe; to whom I consecrate both my selfe and It. And yet, though the subject be Sacred, and points directly at the Creator of us all, yet there may be (and are by all likelihood) frail∣ties in the discourse; which as they will meete with some cavill or opposition, so they will re∣quire a Bulwarke and defence also, and from whom more properly, than from a Great man! who both in place and nature is nearest to his God (if Goodnesse, as it ought, shake hands with Greatnesse;) and of that no man dispaires in a Noble disposition, where but to questi∣on vertue, were to profane it. Your Countrey hath often tasted of the Greatnesse of your Spi∣rit, and where there is Spirit, truely there must be something that is divine also; which cannot but speake your Goodnesse without controule, from me especially,
