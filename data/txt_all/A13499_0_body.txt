MOst Honorificicabilitudinitatibus,
I hauing studied the seuen Lub∣berly
Sciences (being nine by
computation) out of which
I gathered three coniunctions
foure mile Asse-vnder, which with much la∣bour,
and great ease, to little or no purpose,
I haue Noddicated to your gray graue and
grauelled Prate ection. I doubt not but I
might haue had a Patrone neerer hand, as the
Deane of Dunstable, or the Beadle of Layton
Buzzard, but that I know the prase, Me∣thod

and Stile, is not for euery mans vnder∣standing,
no my most renowned Pythagor-Asses,
for you this Hogshead of inuention
was brewed and broched, for I am ignorant∣ly
perswaded that your wisedome, can pick as
much matter out of this Booke in one day as
both the Vniuersities can in twelue moneths,
and thirteene Moones, with sixe times foure
yeeres to boot. I know your bounties too ex∣ding,
for as old mother Baly said, the wit of
man was much when she saw a dog muzzled.I haue Hi∣story for this our of an Illite∣rate well printed Poem in Prose, inti∣tuled, the wise men of Gothā, of much antiquity.
Euery man is not borne to make a Monu∣ment
for the Cuckoo; to send a Trifoote
home alone, to driue sheepe before they haue
them, or to Trundle Cheeses down a hill. So
saluting you with more prespect then the Ma∣ior
of Loo, did the Queenes Ape, I take leaue
to leaue you, and rest yours to bid you wel∣come,
if you came within a mile of my house
to stay all night.
