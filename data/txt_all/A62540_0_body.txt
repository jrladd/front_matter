SIR,
BEsides your many favors confer∣red upon my unworthy self for a thankful acknowledgement; I am also many ways (as I con∣ceive) obliged to present unto you this Treatise, as having its spring and first appearance under your Command, where your faithful endeavours are imployed for the advancement of the glory of God, in your many encouragements to those under your charge, to be daily exercised in such
duties and services, as being religiously im∣proved, will be your Crown and their com∣fort in the day of the Lord Jesus, when all present shadows of honours will be swallow∣ed up in that immortal glory, which is pre∣pared for all such as are free in laying out themselves for the honour of this King of Glory, as your self (dear Sir) have of∣ten been, in improving your interest with Christ on the behalf of this Commonwealth and our Neighbour Nations, upon emergent occasions: Another motive enducing me to prefix your name, is your affection to those Changes that attend the coming of Christ, as they are digested in the Title Page, which your Worship caused me to write down in a Book which I am perswaded you dearly love above all the world.
Sir, I doubt not you will be more affected to finde each of these wonderful Changes di∣stinctly cleared and proved by the Word of Truth, (as I suppose they are in this lit∣tle Book.)
Truly Sir, The holding of them forth hath cost me dear, upon the rising of a spirit of emulattion in some, who could not brook that applause which was openly gi∣ven to these Truths upon the delivery thereof.

But I have heard such expressions from you, which have savored of another spirit, as loving Truth for Truths sake by whomsoever declared.
One word from you hath made a deep im∣pression upon my spirit, by which I desire my affections may be regulated; namely, Of loving men for Religions sake, and not Religion for any mens sake: these, with other of like nature, have raised my affections to present this Treatise to your much honored name: if you find Truth evident, I have confidence you will give it entertainment: and though any thing herein should seem to be New Light, yet I hope it will not be the less welcome, if it appear True Light.
Sir, I might have inlarged this Epistle upon good and subslantial grounds in refe∣rence to you, as your unwearied Service, and constant fidelity (as of all your flou∣rishing Family) to this State; your present Employments in the faithful administration of Justice, and the like.
But for sundry reasons I forbear, Closing with my unfeighned desires of the wel∣fare of your pretious soul, that it may flourish in that full Society of Glorified
Saints in New Jerusalem, as it is dai∣ly expected to be manifested in Power by
SIR,
