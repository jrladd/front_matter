A COURT adorned with virtue, and sanctifi∣ed with pietie, is here, most EXCELLENT QUEEN, to your view presented; which ha∣ving once already in pure and Native colours received light and life from the bright eye of your Royal BROTHER, would gladly at this time, in a harsher language and ruder garment, adventure your gracious acceptance.
The subject is serious, the discourse usefull, and proper for those, who in Court so serve Princes, that they neg∣lect not an humble acknowledgement to a more transcen∣dent Greatness.
It hath pleased GOD, as a singular favour to this Kingdom, to affoard us in your MAjESTIE a pious Queen, who exemplarly maketh good, what diffusedly is here handled. Let then lesser lights borrow beams of ra∣diance, from your greater Orbs; and persist You, Glo∣rious Example of virtue, to illuminate and heat our Nor∣thern Clime with celestiall ardours. Adde to earthly Crowns, heavenly Diadems of Piety.

 Here shall a HOLY COURT be found fairly deline∣ated; nor can I see how it will be in the power of persons of best eminence, to plead ignorance, and pretend inabi∣lity; they having such a Book to direct them, and such a Queen to follow.
Lead then with alacritie, most Sacred MAJESTIE, and may propitious Heaven so prosper your holy desires, that the Greatest may have matter to imitate, and the whole Nation to admire.
