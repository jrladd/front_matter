THere came of late (right Reuerend
and right Honorable Prince) two
bookes out of England; one whereof
bare title of the Renowned King
Iames; the other of his Chaplain:
both which, as manifestly oppugning the Roman
Church, I haue, for the loue of truth, refuted as
modestly as I could. As for the former I haue dedica∣ted
the Confutation therof to the Inuincible Empe∣rour

Rodulph, and the other renowned Kinges, &
Illustrious Princes of the Christian world (among
whome you are one:) But the later I haue thought it
not amisse to dedicate specially vnto your magnificēt
Name; and that for two reasons. The one, that
for so much as I haue taken this paines for defence
of the Catholicke faith and Religion; it seemes vnfit
that the same should be published vnder the Patro∣nage
of any other, then your selfe who are so great a
professor and protector of the said faith in Germa∣ny.
The other reason is, for that your meritts and
benefitts towards our Archiepiscopall Colledge of
Mentz, do by a certaine right challenge, and exact
the same at my hands. You will, I trust, take i
in good part, and fauourably accept this my sin∣cere
token of Duty and Reuerence.
