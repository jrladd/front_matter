SEeing to nothing I am more bound, then to serve your High∣nesse, I cannot consequently have any greater desire then to be accounted your servant: that as the benefits which our House continually receiveth, are pub∣likely knowne; so the markes of my devotion may publikely appeare; which after dedicating my selfe to your Highnesse, I cannot bet∣ter manifest, then by offering these Discourses; which are so farre unequall to your greatnesse, and to what I ow you, that it may well appeare to be rather done for confession of my debt, then for satisfaction of that obligation, which as it can onely receive abatement from your commands, so commands comming from so great a Prince, will have force againe to make it the greater. Vouchsafe then to honour me with com∣manding me, thereby to make me the more obliged: and be pleased to accept these weake labours, with looking upon the value which your Heroicall Name gives them. And upon the weight which my devotion puts upon them, with which I wish to your Highnesse all those felicities; which as you give manifest proofes to merit, so by the divine goodnesse you shall hap∣pily obtaine: And so I present you the most humble Reverence,
Of Your Highnesse most devoted servant,
VIRGILIO MALVEZZI.
