May it please your Lordship,
THere is none to whom I owe account of my self and Studies, more than to
 your Lordship as my Dioce∣san. None to whom I more readily submit this Essay, which endeavours to do Right to the Church of England, whose Honour and Security is so great a part of your Lordships care, as to challenge the acknowledgment of all Pens. The Moderation of our Church (which ought to be esteem'd her Glory) in re∣ceding no farther from the Church of Rome, than she has receded from Primitive Chri∣stianity, is objected as a Crime, by the eager men of the sepa∣ration.
Our First Reformers were
 Wise men, and (Thanks be to God) so are their Succes∣sors too. Their Wisdom in the first compiling, and late Review of our Liturgy, has directed them to keep the mean between the Two Extreams, of too much stiffness in refusing, and too much easiness in admit∣ting variations. So by the good Providence of God, have we been deliver'd from the superstitions of the Romish Church; and so have we been preserved from a superstitious avoiding superstition.
As the Kingdom of Eng∣land is famous for being the Balance of Europe; so is the
 Church of England, for being, by a regular Reformation, well fix'd in a due distance between the superstitious addi∣tions of the Church of Rome, where Supremacy, Infallibility, and the Inquisition compel men to swallow Camels, and the superstitious Abstinences of those who strain at Gnats, and either will not Under∣stand the notion of a thing Indifferent, or will not rightly infer from it.
To evince this, is the De∣sign of the following Tract, which in all humility I offer to your Lordships Patronage, being thereto embolden'd,
 by the Experience I have had of your Lordships Can∣dor and Favour, which by how much the less I have me∣rited, I ought the more to ac∣knowledge.
God Almighty preserve your Lordship to a long Pre∣sidency in this Church: and bless the joint labours and cares of the Right Reverend my Lords the Bishops, to such an happy Repair of our Breaches; that neither the Wild-Boar, nor the Foxes, may spoil our Vineyard: to be such a defence upon the Glory of this Church, that
 neither the Romanist nor Se∣paratist, may stain or darken it. So prayeth,
