THat which at this time moved me to present you with this ensuing Discourse, is that heavenly and glorious shape and form, where∣with the great Red Dragon is now come forth in the Spirits of Professors; never was the Dragon in more glorious habit

then now: O how he is array∣ed, how his mouth is ful fraught with pretended immediate and perfect enjoyments of God in the Spirit, under colour of which he seeks to deceive, and by his taile to draw those down, out of heaven into the earth, that have shined as stars in heaven: he is great, and he is red, that is to say, he is mighty and he is bloody; His mightiness and bloodyness lye hid under his glorious appea∣rances; He is called in Scripture that old Serpent, whose tail is full of windings and turnings, who was of old in the begining, Gen. 3. He is called likewise the Devil and Sathan, a Deceiver and

an Adversary; he is all these names under beautiful Discove∣ries and appearances of God; he is wrapped up and covered in and under Doctrines, Speak∣ings, Writings of men and Dis∣coveries of God, he ushereth in Errors with glorious truths. In his appearing to Professors he looks first how their Natures are inclined, he casteth an eye first at the bent of their Spirits, That way which they are inclined he wil sute himself in apparell, if they be inclined towards Noti∣ons, Fictions, Forms, or preten∣ded high injoyments of God without power, he sutes himself accordingly; he makes use of

Scripture likewise to strengthen him in his Designs. These and many others are his subtilties now adayes: this Dragon is de∣scribed to be a wonder in hea∣ven, Revel. 12. because of his seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads: a wonder indeed you wil say it is, when you come to be taken up with John into the Spirit: The Dragon wants no wisdome to tempt, deceive, and devour, for he hath seven heads; no power to bring about his designs, for he hath ten horns; and he wants no glory wherewith to promise to professors, if they will fall down and worship him, be∣cause

he hath seven Crowns.
Beloved Friends, therefore I have written this ensuing Dis∣course likewise, to shew you the multiplicity of subtilty, power, and glory, that is in him to de∣ceive, and which I have seen to be in him; Do not therefore, O do not slight what I have writ∣ten, though confused and scat∣tered; it is the day of smal things which God would not have you despise, consider well what I have written, before you begin to censure it: and if you finde any truth in what I write, mind that more then he that writ it. If you inquire whose this Dis∣course is, it is the discourse of a

bruised Reed, and of smoaking flax, of a suckling, of a babe in Christ, out of whose mouth God will perfect his praise.
