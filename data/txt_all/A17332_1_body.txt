SIR, among many patrons of ver∣tue, and Theologicall endeuours, I presume to rank your name; who as I know you not inferiour to the best, for a Fautor of learning and a louer of Pietie; so I present you here with such a worke best fitting your addiction, and most worthie your patronage. And howsoeuer I may seeme officiously bold to publish these things without free consent of the Au∣thor (as I confesse I do:) yet out of earnest desire to raise him from obscuritie to a deserued eminence in the worlds ac∣count, and throughly moued with pitie, that so heauenly things should perish with the breath they were deliuered, (as if eternitie should fade with a moment:) I haue aduen∣tured to giue them longer life, seconding my boldnesse
 with a strong presumption, that I shall frustrate needlesse doubts, and herein deserue your good opinion. And on this hope I rest, committing the sequele to your serious view, and my attempt in this to your fauourable con∣struction.
