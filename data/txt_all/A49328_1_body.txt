MADAM,
IN presuming to dedicate this imperfect Peece to the most accomplish'd Princesse of the Earth, I confesse to shew much more ambition then discretion, more rashnes then solid reason and moderation; but seeing or∣dinarily that the greatest Per∣sons have the least pride, and the most charity, I cast my selfe wholy upon your clemency, and fly the test of your judg∣ment, which being so exact, would doubly condemne me, first in the designe it selfe, next in the conduct, and consequen∣ce of it, as being a composition

weak, and unworthy of so high a Patronage. If it may serve to divert Your Highnesse in some vacant hower when your sub∣lime thoughts are suspended, I have the onely end I aime at, and shall glory in the honour and happines to introduce some thing with the New Yeere, which may give you the least satisfaction: My conclu∣sion is a most humble petition for pardon, and a favourable censure of the bould ambition, which I have to entitle my selfe,
MADAM,
