May it please your Grace,
AS I have had the Honour to march
under Your Banners in the Field,
so I now presume to appear under
the Ensigns of Your Impartial
Justice. I am fully satisfy'd, that
in the delivery of my Evidence, I utter'd no∣thing
but the Truth. So that if by this humble
Address to Your Grace, I presume to make You
the Patron of Truth, I hope Your Grace will
pardon my Presumption, when You shall be
pleas'd to consider that I had no other way to
make a publick acknowledgment to the World,
how deeply I am engag'd to Your Grace for those
many Favours which You have bin pleas'd to
showr upon my Ʋndeserts. And for those ill
Reflections that have bin thrown upon me by
the Guilty for my Duty to my Soveraign, I
value them but little; and far the less, as one
that has some reason to believe that Your Grace

has a better Opinion of me. That honour I shall
alwayes study to advance by a studious obser∣vance
of Your Graces Commands, humbly ho∣ping
that to the rest of Your signal Favours, You
will be pleas'd to add the Acceptance of this
small Offering from
