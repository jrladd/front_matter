BEcause I count a promise bt (my Deere)
Especially vnto a speciall friend,
This promis'd pledge to your sweet selfe I send▪
A gloome glasse of your perfections cleere▪


A pourtraiture resembling nothing neere
Your heauenly features, that in worth extend
Beyond the reach of my poore rymes commend,
As in this plot I make too plaine appeare.


Yet since for you amid my dumps I drew it,
And since your selfe haue since desir'd to see it;
With mild aspect vouchsafe (bright-star) to view it.
To doome whereof, in your discretion beit:
But deee withall, that in this bitter story
I graue my griefes, and not your beauties glory.

Vincenti gloria Victi▪
