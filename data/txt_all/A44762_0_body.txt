SIR,
I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me, called the Popish Royall Favorite; and according to your advice (which I value in a high degree) I put pen to paper, and something you may see I have done (though in a poore pam∣phleting way) to cleare my selfe of those aspersions that are cast upon me therein. But truly Sir, I was never so unfit for such a task; all my Papers, Manuscripts, and Notes, ha∣ving been long since seized upon and kept from me. Adde hereunto, that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three Moneths close restraint (the sense wherof, I find hath much stupified my spirits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sicknes, a high burning feaver, with the new disease, whereof my Body as well as my Mind is yet somewhat crazie: so that (take all afflictions toge∣ther) I may truly say, I have passed the Ordeal, the fiery Tryall. But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see bet∣ter dayes I hope; for out of this fatall black Cloud, which now oresets this poore Island, I hope there will breake a glo∣rious Sun-shine of peace and firme happinesse: To effect which, had I a Jury, a grand-Jury of lives, I would sacri∣fice them all, and triumph in the oblation.
So I most affectionately kisse your hands, and rest

From the Prison of the Fleet.
