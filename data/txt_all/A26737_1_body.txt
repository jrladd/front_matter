Sir,
THough I took the liberty, some years since, to pub∣lish the Latin Diatribe of the worthy Doctor, which I found in my Lord Hop∣ton. Lords Cabi∣net, after his decease; yet I could not so well presume to address it, as, I am confi∣dent,

intended by the Learned Author, unto your noble self; By my adventure in the Translation I have somewhat improv'd my Title, to a degree of propriety, and can so far ju∣stifie yours, at least to what is mine, if you please to own a Pa∣tronage of the work, under so much disadvantage, as the change of Language puts upon it. Your approbation of it in the design gives mee no full as∣surance of your satisfaction at sight and reading; but your a∣bility to judge the difficulty of

Englishing such matters, in such a stile as they require, and your incouragement of all that aims at the publick good, yeeld mee hopes of your acceptance, and dispensation with whatso∣ever unavoidable defects; That it was presented to you no sooner, you in part know the reason; until of late it hath been as hard to finde a Press for any Treatise that vindica∣ted our Church, as for a De∣dicatory Epistle to any Resi∣dent of our King: But my long frustrated attendance for

a Supplement from Mr. Ju∣stell was the first Dilatory it had, and very lately, I think, it hath been discountenanced by an aversion, if no more, of some private Inquisitours, where you are, from all that hangs the Church of Eng∣land on this hinge of Primitive Antiquity, or the Authority of Ancient Councils. It waits on you now, accompanied with somewhat I communica∣ted not before, obtained by the friendly industry of that Mr. Thomas Coventry. ingenious

Gentleman, who sent mee F. Barnes's Manuscript, whence I selected what (and more than what) the Doctor directs us to, though hee survives not to entertain the duplicate of my thanks, nor to take pleasure in the effect of his own pains, or mine, and to actuate further the most commendable quality, which happily discoverd it self very early in him, a singular complacency in accommoda∣ting a private friend, and a generous promptitude to ad∣vance any thing wherein pub∣lick

interest was concerned. I must needs, in gratitude, do him the honour of laying this leaf of Lawrel on his Hearse, which hath passed through several hands of our Reverend Clergy, and Gentry, Paris. where hee died, recommended, Sir, with your own serious condolence unto mine, That he acquired the character of a prudent ex∣emplary young Gentleman in his life, and a very pious Chri∣stian in the self-discerned ap∣proaches to his death.
Sir, for printing the Doctors

Letter, I should apologize (un∣to him) if you lent mee not yours to countenance it; as your permitting it before to be read and copied, had signified your inclination to have some such right done to our Church, and him, which could not better be than in company with another work of his own, and what his approves. The advertisement you further gave mee, that his additional Relations were ad∣dressed to Sir George Rad∣cliffe, came too late for mee to recover them, by the means I

used, out of his Papers; as the notice of his death did for some other Letters that had passed, to my knowledge, between my Lord, and Sir George, upon Theological points of contro∣versie, wherein they differed, and which they discussed with some little earnestness, yet ; If the for∣mer be not irrecoverably dis∣posed of, Sir, you have now a fair opportunity to secure them; though, if the good Doctor himself be living, the late mis∣fortune befallen the Country

learned Dr. Basier Dr. Duncon Travel∣lers, not to exercise their function where the du∣ty of praying for the King should be prohibited; And a signal instance it was of Christi∣an courage in our Reverend Author, when an Exile, to refuse the offer of a plentiful support, where that would not be allowed; yet it had been worth his journey to Smyrna, to convert the Consul, who now, I hope, hath more than the Merchants argument (which many times is more prevalent

with men of business, than the Divines) I mean, that of In∣terest, to convince him.
Sir, The benediction the Doctor gives to you and yours, in allusion to that which issued from the Ark to Obed Edoms house, I have a very particular obligation to suffrage in, though so long after the date of his; It was testimonium Dei faven∣tis, saith Grotius; and , saith Phi∣lo, of the Propitiatory, or cover to it, a testimony or symbole of Gods favourable and

powerfull Mercy to the good man; not so restrained to the presence, but, even after its removal to the City of David, no doubt, he and his family were blessed by it. Sir, the pub∣lick exercise of our Liturgy, is the Antitype we reflect upon, which, by Gods singular indulgence to you, hath, when chased out of the Temple, took refuge in your House, so that we have been forced many times to argue from your Oratory for a visibility of our Church; Your easie admission of mee to officiate in it for some months, and your endeavours to have such an e∣stablishment made for mee, as whereby, in the most difficult of times, I might have had a comfortable subsistence, and a safe protection under your sacred roof, beside the other graces and civi∣lities

I had from you, exact this open retribution of my thanks; as the chara∣cter of my holy Order, impressed on mee in your Chapel, may have con∣signed mee, somewhat peculiarly, to be your Priest, when any emergent may require the Canonical performance of my Ministery within your walls; However, Sir, I shall not offer the holy Sacrifice at any of Gods Altars (which are now again erecting by a most miraculous mercy to his King and People) but I shall commemorate, in your behalf, the little emblem you pre∣served of them, when they lay in their dust and ruines; nor shall the cloud of sacred incense ascend in the Sanctuary without the mixture of my breath, while I have it, to ask a return from Heaven, in showers of blessings to

you, and your posterity, whose name, & memory, must be ever venerable to the English Clergy, as your person hath been most obliging to many of us, a∣mong whom, though the unworthiest of them, I pray assist and honour with the continuance of your patronage,
Noble Sir, 
Caen,
Aug. 12. 1660.
