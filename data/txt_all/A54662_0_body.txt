Worthy Patriots.
I Know not to whom I could more pro∣perly make the Dedication of the fol∣lowing Poem, since it seems naturally to crave your protection, not only as you are the Subject of it, but because its palpable you have endeavourd to monopolize every thing that has but the appeareance of a Fault: so that tis but rational to infer that you are able to bear mine too, tho never
so Numerous in this Poem, which I must confess was done in Raptim, and therefore must have the greater need of such Patrons; not but that its an unquestioned Verity that you have a sufficient stock of your own, without any addition of mine: For who (in the Divels Name) has been the fo∣menters of all feuds and Animosities in this Nation? But you: Who the Authors, and Abetters of all things that may seem to oppose the common Tranquillity? But you: Who has endeavourd by all that Hell and Malice could invent, to make our Streets blush in Innocent Bloud, and Involve it once more into its Oliverian Chaos? But you: Who I say, has endeavourd the Total Subversion of Monarchy, the Ruine of three Kingdoms, the distruction of Re∣ligion it self, and the undoing of all that Dare to be its Proselytes? But you: So that by these and other your unparalelld Villa∣nies (too Numerous to Incert) you have put Hell to a non-plus, and the Divels, themselves into Distraction and Amaze∣ment, to see themselves out done, and all
together incapable of preparing a place for your reception, adequate to the Worse then Scythian Cruelties that you have, and would have perpetrated.
But not to make the Porch bigger then all the Fabrick, I shall conclude with this Charitable Prayer, may Poyson be your Drink, and Toads, worse than Toads your cheifest Delicacies, may your Names be Eternally Obliterated from Honours Book, may your Curse, but equalize your defects, and as you have ever made Bloud your Bol∣ster to lye on, so let Insupportable Greifs be your Play-fellows and Inseparable Com∣panions.
