Madam,
GReatness, so Eminent as that of Your High∣ness, plac'd in a Sphere beyond the level of the Ordinary Noble, be∣comes never so Attractive and Illustrious, then when it is atten∣ded

with those Excellencies of Affability, Benignity, and a con∣stant Charity: Virtues so master∣ly and commanding, that Piety and Religion were but shadows without some one of them: The least whereof being sufficient to intitle a lesser Greatness to Perfection, which are all by Ac∣cumulation con-center'd in Your Highness: And I may safely say, he must be a Foreigner indeed to this our Country of Great Britain, at least to Whitehall and St. James's, who is a stranger and un∣acquainted with your Highness's worth▪ Those early Blossomes in Your tender years gave Us hopes, that the succeeding Fruit would answer their appearances

which we now find Happily ac∣complish'd even to our admira∣tion: And what in other Princes hath been the result of a sudden thought only, or some motion of Virtue by surprize, hath in Your Highness been an Habitual Practice from your Infancy: Your Birth at the same time ador∣ning this our Island with Great∣ness and Goodness.
In assurance therefore of your Gracious Pardon, this small Treatise is humbly offer'd at Your Highness's Feet, containing the Origin and Succession of those two August and Royal Families of Great Britain and Denmark, and the present Union in Your High∣ness

and Prince George: At whose Auspitious Arrival (like a second Patron to the English,) all the Plots and Conspiracies of Yours and the Nations Enemies became Blasted and Abortive. The Noble Brightness of Your most Excellent Father His Royal High∣ness, (so long and so unjustly clouded by Faction and the Un∣thinking Vulgar,) restored, all good men (who were in pain for His Majesty's and His Safety) Comforted; and the whole Mo∣narchy receiving at once both Deliverance, Strength and Secu∣curity from this Alliance. The continuance of which Happiness for the present, and the joyful expectation of Establishing it for

the future in Your Royal Pro∣geny, are the constant Wishes and Desires of,
Madam
