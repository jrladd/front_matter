My LORD,
I Humbly beg leave to offer the following History to your EXCELLENCY; to which, among other Con∣siderations, a Principle of Gratitude has determin'd me, to express in some measure the Sence I have of the present Blessings we all enjoy (and which bring

my Labours of this kind to a most Happy Conclusion) by a Glorious Peace, in the Management whereof your EXCELLENCY has been so much concern'd: My LORD, This is a Work which will make your Name Great and Happy in the Memory of all Succeeding Generations, as it ingrafts it at present in the Hearts and Affections of all Men in England that value their Religion, Rights and Liberties which they find establish'd upon a stable and solid Foundation in the perfection of so Great a Work.
But this, My LORD, is not the only Title you have to our Thanks and Praise; the great hand you had in bring∣ing about the happy Revolution, and the Share you have had in almost all the Actions of our great Monarch ever since, are what ought to make you ever dear to England, and almost all the rest of Europe.
My LORD, I will not pretend to enter upon your EXCELLENCY's Panegyrick in this Epistle, it is indeed more than can be compriz'd in it, as well as a Subject above the Power of my Pen: You were dedicated even in your Youth to His Majesty's Service, at which time you gave such uncommon Demonstrations of Zeal, Fidelity and Affection, as have justly fix'd you in His Royal Fa∣vours: And as might well be expected from such be∣ginnings, you have been ever since ingag'd in the Great Atchievements of Glory and Renown: In Warre, you have been a constant Partaker of all those Dangers to which our Great Monarch has so often and so wonder∣fully expos'd Himself in the Bloody and Hazardous Fields of Mars, you have still been with Him in so many Battles

and Sieges, you have shar'd in all the Fatigues of so many Campagnes, and have been a considerable Actor in His most Happy and Successful Enterprizes.
In Peace, Your EXCELLENCY has had the Ministry of the most Important Affairs of Europe  equal Integrity, Wisdom and Faithfulness, and  for His Majesty's Advantage as your own Honour and Reputation: Such Rare and Extraordinary Qualities have induc'd the King to make Choice of Your EXCELLENCY for his Ambassadour Extraordinary in a Court, where espe∣cially in the present Conjuncture of Affairs, they are more than ever requisite; In the discharge of which most Noble Function you have justified the Choice that has been made of your Person by answering in all things the Greatness of Your Master, and the Credit, Wealth and Renown of a Nation, you have always had a particular Ambition to be a Member of, and whose Welfare, Hap∣piness and Prosperity you aim at in all your Proceed∣ings.
But, My LORD, all this would be but Vanity, were there not a better Foundation for the Glory of another World, by a true Sence of Piety, and an uprightness of Conscience, for which your Life is so Exemplary: And may your EXCELLENCY go on daily more and more in doing good, especially in this respect, both by your Authori∣ty and good Example; that Vice, Irreligion and Profane∣ness meeting with all Discouragements from so eminent a Person, we may see Vertue, Justice and Godliness (which is like to be our best Security for the continuance of the pre∣sent

Peace) flourish under so good an Influence: These are the Hearty Wishes and Prayers of
My LORD,
