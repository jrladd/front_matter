TO thee that well deseru'st that Epethite,
As a sure witnes of my spotlesse loue,
These lines my true affections fruit I write,
My faithfull zeale in publike to approue,
Of thee no tongue (vnlesse of enuy hatefull)
Can speak but well, so wel doest thou deserue.
My pen, vnlesse I should be too vngratefull,
Must make thine liue, when vulgar names shall sterue
Thy vertues shal by me in serious layes,
Be caractred for euery eye to view.
No time shall set a period to thy prayse,
That our ingenious Muse shall still pursue:
For thy perfections powerfull vigor lent,
Vnto my thoughts euen languishing & spent.
