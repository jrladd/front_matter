SIR,
IT is a position, and
maine Tenent agreed
upon by the most judi∣cious,
that to attaine unto Ho∣nour,
Wisedome is the truly Pole∣starre,
and to retaine it, Vertue
the sole Patronesse: It being non

ad tempus Invitamentum, sed per∣petuae
virtutis premium. To
which, though some have arri∣ved
by favour, others by fortune,
yet it may be ingeniously con∣fest
of You, that by Your owne
merit You have won to this me∣ridian:
Into which the sacred
Majesty of Great Brittaine ha∣ving
a true inspection, out of
many others, hee made select
choise of you, (for your known
abilities) to create his Lord Em∣bassadour
to the Majesty of the
Empire. And during your a∣bode
at Vienna in Austria, where
the Emperors Court was then
kept, the Gentleman, Author

hereof, Mr. Richard Hurst (now
deceased) your (then) servant
and Secretary, at his more spare
and retired houres, made this
his Worke his play, and in his
most solitude his best solace.
And unto whose Patronage may
it more properly appertaine,
than to your Noble selfe, be∣ing
writ in your forraigne ser∣vice.
This was the maine in∣ducement,
which not onely in∣couraged,
but imboldned me to
this presentment, knowing that
Honos alit Artes; and the rather
presuming on your acceptance
hereof, since they who in their
life time the Muses most fa∣vour,

those, after life, the nine
Sisters most honour. Thus,
with pardon for my bold∣nesse
crav'd, I humbly take
my leave of You.
