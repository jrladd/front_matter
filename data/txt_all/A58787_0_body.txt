My Lord,
THAT I presume to lay these Papers at your Lordships feet, is not because I imagin they deserve, but because I am Conscious they need so great a Patronage. Not but that were the Discourses they contain as great and meritorious as their Argu∣ment, they might safely shelter themselves under their own Deserts, and challenge Homage instead of begging Protecti∣on; but though I have done my best En∣deavour

to treat this great Theme suita∣bly to its own native Majesty, yet I am very sensible it hath not escap'd the too common Fate of all such sublime and ex∣cellent Subjects, which is, to be foul'd and sullyed by coarse handling. But my lot falling in this unhappy Age, wherein the best Church and Religion in the World are in such apparent Danger of being Cru∣cified, like their blessed Author, between those two Thieves (and both, alas, impeni∣tent ones) Superstition and Enthusi∣asm, I thought my self obliged not to sit still as an unconcerned Spectator of the Tragedy, but in my little Sphere, and according to my poor Ability, to indeavour its Prevention: And considering that the most effectual Means the Romanists have used to subvert this Church, which they so much envy, and all the Refor∣mations do so much admire and depend on, hath been to divide her own Children from her, and arm them against her, by starting new Opinions among them, and

ingaging their Zeal (which was wont to be imploy'd to better Purposes) in hot Disputes about the Modes and Circum∣stances of her Worship; I thought a Dis∣course of the Christian Life, which is the proper Sphere of Christian Zeal, might be a good Expedient to take men off from those dangerous Contentions which were kindled and are fed and blown by such as design our common Ruin. For sure did our People throughly understand what 'tis to be Christians indeed, and how much Duty that implies, they could never find so much Leisure as they do to quarrel and wrangle about Trifles.
This, my Lord, is the sincere Design of what I here present to your Lordship; and however it may succeed, I have this Satisfaction that I meant well, and have exprest my Good Will to this poor envied Church, whose truly Primitive Constitution, pure and undefiled Religion, I shall always admire and reverence; and whatsoever her Fate may be, I am chain'd

to her Fortunes by my Reason and Con∣science, and shall ever esteem it more eli∣gible to be crusht in pieces by her Fall, which God avert, than to flourish and Triumph on her Ruines.
But among the many ill Omens that threaten our Church, there is one which seems to presage its Prosperity; and that is, that such Eminent Stations in it as your Lordships, are so excellently suppli∣ed. For although whether the Part you are design'd for, be to Grace her Tri∣umphs or her Funeral, is known only to the soveraign Disposer of Events, yet this, my Lord, all that wish well to our Church conclude, that God bestow'd You upon her as a Token of Love. For which they have sufficient Warrant even from the daily Experience they have of the Prudence and Vigilance of your Government, the Piety, Integrity and Generosity of your Temper, of your invincible Loyalty to your Prince, your undaunted Zeal for the Reformed Religion, and grave and

Obliging Deportment towards all you con∣verse with. I shall trouble your Lord∣ship no farther, but conclude this Address with that which I am sure is the hearty Prayer of all your honest Clergy, that the God of Heaven would long continue your Lordship a Blessing to the Church and to this Diocess, an Honour to your Sacred Order and the Noble Stock you de∣scend from; and if what I here present prove but so prosperous as to do some good in the World, and obtain your Lordships Acceptance, it will be a noble Compensati∣on of this well-meant Endeavour. I am,
My Lord,
