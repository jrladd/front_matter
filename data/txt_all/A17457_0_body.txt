cure mine owne infirmi∣ties, who desperately ill of a surfet, and giuen ouer by the best Doctor of my fortunes, found no comfort but in re∣tiring, and asking counsell of that heauenly, and neuer∣erring Physician, who came into the world to cure all manner of Diseases; which euer intending to publish for the good, I hope, of others, that dare take so much time, to thinke of their sickenesse, and practise a recouerie: I did not long labour for a De∣dication,
