WHat I haue read of Sisimus; expe∣rience resolues mee of your Honour: that you are temperate, vertuous, liberall: whereof my sight, hearing, feeling, haue made me, a sensible,
and iust witnesse. There∣fore though I were often discouraged, whilest my vnpractised hand was tra∣uelling in this Tract, and thought (as Dauid, when he put off Sauls armour, because he could not goe with it, beeing not ac∣customed) to haue re∣tired, with the losse of some paines: especially seeing, both opportunity, place, and requisite furni∣ture, were wanting to fa∣uour my attempt: yet these reasons, not ceasing to allure me, I followed them, faintly (as I could) so far, as any time would
giue mee leaue; For as there can be none, more challenging then your Honour: so great fa∣uours, freely deignd vnto me: so would my negli∣gence (at lest to striue, in some measure) to re∣quite them, I considered, sprinkle me, with the fow∣lest blemish of ingrati∣tude. And finding your Honour so fit a perso∣nage, in regard of the gra∣tious temper of your mind, to Patronize a Worke of this nature, which handleth that an∣cient argument, giuen at the first conquest, of our
first Parents in the Gar∣den (Pleasure; and Am∣bition) (both so inci∣dent, to their noblest wi∣sest, and mightiest of∣spring after the flesh, that Saint Paul in this respect noteth, their condition to be most dangerous: and consequently, that they haue most neede of all o∣thers, to be put in remem∣brance) whereof I haue apertly, and briefly dis∣played the vanity: as be∣ing the maine, and profes∣sed aduersaries of a con∣scionable care, of religi∣ous duties; I humbly craue your Honourable
acceptance of it: that it passing vnder the pro∣tection of such vertue, o∣thers may bee animated, (like Adonijah flying for the safegaurd of his life, to the hornes of the Al∣tar) to hasten from these extreames, to the con∣stant, and safe Pillars of Temperance, and a Chri∣stian reioycing, which I haue like wise pitched vp vnto their view, and these will be able, as to defend them from infamy in this life: so to present them blamelesse, in the day of our common apperance. I must acknowledge my
selfe to haue written this Treatise, in a boisterous Tempest, that by looking downeward, I might not see the threatning clouds ouer my head, nor great∣ly feare their fall: therein imitating Vlisses; that stopped his eares with wax; and would be tied to the maine mast of his ship, that he might not heare the Sirens to his de∣struction: so haue I put of with silence, occasio∣ned by this imployment, the busie whisperings, and sometimes the pub∣like clamors, of a distem∣pered multitude: that I
might reteine patience, in their highest displea∣sure, which was kindled with no other fire, but of mine earnest, and double industry, in seruing two allied Chappels in one day. For which cau∣ses, I knowing these la∣bours of mine, vnwor∣thy of so graue, and ap∣proued a iudgement: submissly desire, that the sinceritie of my intenti∣on, may rectifie, or at least excuse my faultes, as your Honour shall meete with them. The Lord speake peace vn∣to your soule: and grant
your Honour many pros∣perous dayes on earth, that God may bee glorified in you, you in his Christ.
