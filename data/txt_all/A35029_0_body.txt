Good Reader,
IT may be you do not take your self to be one of those who need this Second Call to Humiliation; you not being of the number of those exorbitant Sinners, whose no∣torious Vices cry aloud for Judgment. First then, humble your self in thankfulness to God for his preventing Grace, that you are not; for assuredly by Nature you are the same. Secondly, Consider that though the main bulk of sin belong to others, yet when the Vessel is near full, a small addition will fill up the mea∣sure, yea, and may make it run over; and on that account your guilt may be great, and your Humiliation necessary. Thirdly, Though you contribute nothing to the measure (a rare

Blessing) yet as a member of the body, you are bound by Nature & Religion both to do your utmost endeavour to keep off the evil from the whole; this likewise requires your Humilia∣tion as necessary. Yet, say you, none of all that makes this my Sermon necessary, there being other abler Sermons already abroad to this ef∣fect: Pardon me, this may be notwithstand∣ing a necessary help. When four strong men are labouring to raise a heavy Log, and are near effecting it, the addition of a fifth, though weaker, may be necessary to compleat the work, at least may make it easier and surer. And I shall count it no small happi∣ness to have contributed something towards the true humiliation and reformation of this sinful Land. God of his infinite mercy by his powerful Grace assist all our endeavours.
Amen.
