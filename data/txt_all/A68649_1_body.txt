ALthough (right noble Captaynes and wor∣thie Souldiours) I may seeme too rashe and bolde to enter into those discourses so farre surpassing my capacitie, the which I knowe I haue finished not according as the argument hath required, but according as the slendernes of my skyll would permit me: yet I protest, I haue not taken in hand to write, for any vayne glory or presumption in my selfe, but rather to incite some one amongst you, that is more able & sufficient, to performe a greater enterprise, to a much better perfection: and for my parte, I haue but vsed the office of the meanest labouring man, & (as it were) haue but brought lyme and stone together, wherewith the master worke∣man maye erecte his building in braue and sumptuous sorte.
Thus crauing pardon for this my bolde attempt, I sub∣mit altogether what I haue done to your noble iudge∣mentes, to correcte and amende what you shall see needfull and requisite. And thus I rest, yours to dispose
