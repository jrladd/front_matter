IT is sayde, (dread Soveraigne) by Salomon, that great King of Wisedome, Vertue, and Peace, that a Kinges favour, is like the dew upon the grasse: as if hee should say, that the commendation, or
 loving countenance of a King to Vertuous Workes, both encourageth the Workers, and maketh the Works more and more to flowrish within his Kingdome, according to that other Proverbe, Virtus laudata crescit. The efficacie and validitie of eyther of these, I, (though a verie meane Instrument of a verie meane Worke, haue found to bee accomplished by your High∣nesse, (whom GOD hath endued as another Salomon, with the like Princelie Prerogatiues, whose Name therefore bee praysed) and that a diverse times, but chiefelie at your Majesties last beeing in your Highnesse Palace of HOLIE ROOD-HOVSE, after inspection of some of mine owne Exercises of FAIRE WRITING, with certaine rare practises of a nine-yeare-olde Disciple, which I then taught, & at your High∣nesse superscribing of my former Priviledge. For the which Royall Testimonies, and espe∣ciallie for the Priviledge, (which I esteeme the Seale thereof) I most humblie render all hear∣tie thanks unto GOD, and to your Majestie through HIM, in whome I hope to prooue your trustie Servant to the death.
In memorie, consideration, and boldnesse whereof, I haue both with the better courage, and greater expedition, enterprized and accom∣plished this difficill Taske, in finding out a way how Writing may bee learned by Reading: and that for the regarde I owe to the glorie of GOD,
 who is the Author of all sortes of Vertue, of which the dexteritie of Writing is one, your Highnesse pleasure, who under HIM, is the maintainer of all Vertue, within your Royall Kingdomes, the Common-wealth of them all, which springeth from the Fountaine of all Ver∣tue, & to mine owne credite, which I owe both unto GOD, of whome I holde my meane Ta∣lent, your Majesties selfe, Prince CHARLES, your deare and onelie Sonne, to all your High∣nesse Loyall Subjectes of this your Majesties famous Realme of SCOTLAND, and espe∣ciallie the Secret Counsell, Nobilitie, Colledge of Iustice, Vniversities, and chiefe Cities there∣of: (where I was borne, brought up, and doe spende my dayes:) which (albeit not verie woorthie of it selfe, yet because it justlie belon∣geth unto your most Sacred Majestie, beeing both bred in your Highnesse owne Realme, and the first fruites of this kinde that ever did grow therein) I therefore, according as appertaineth, more for mine owne duety, than its valour, with heartie affection, moste humblie propine unto your Majesties most Royall Person, as Master of all the Ground, next unto IEHOVAH, (to remaine under the Saueguarde and prote∣ction of your Highnesse, and your happie Suc∣cessoures favourable Patronage, and Imperiall authoritie, for a common use:) and I recom∣mende
 your Highnesse selfe, with all your most Princelie Progenie, to the blessed Tuition of the most mightie KING of Kinges, during your Reigne in the Earth; and to HIS joy∣full Fruition, to reigne everlastingly with HIM in the Heavens: In whome I rest, while I breathe,
