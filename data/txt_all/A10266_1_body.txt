GReat God, the indebted prayses of thy Glorie,
If Man should smother, or his Muse waxe faint
To number forth; the Stones would make coÌ„plaint,
And write a neuer-ending Storie,
And, not without iust reason, say,
Mens hearts are more chdure then they.



Dismount from Heauen (O thou Diuiner Power)
Handsell my slender Pipe, breathe (thou) vpon it,
That it may run an euerlasting Sonnet,
Which Enuious Time may not deuower:
Oh, let it sing to After-dayes
(When I am Dust) thy lowder Prayse.




Direct the footsteps of my sober Muse
To tread thy glorious Path: For, be it knowne,
She onely seekes thy Glorie, not her owne,
Nor rouzed for a second vse;
If otherwise, O! may she neuer
Sing more, but be struck dumbe for euer.
