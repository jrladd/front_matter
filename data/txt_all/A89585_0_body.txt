Madam,
YOu have been long taught of God, and therefore are not ignorant that spirituall sicknesses differ many wayes from bodily, this one is notable, The more any spiritu∣all disease increaseth, the lesse it's felt, and the more any soule is sensible of it, the lesse power it hath over him; This is found most true of the greatest of spi∣rituall plagues, the sinne of hardnesse of heart, none more confident of the goodnesse of their heart, then the most obstinate and rebellious sinner, where as the most tender-hearted Christian complaines most of hardnesse, the spirit that is most flexible to God, most laments its obstinacy; Madam, I may apply this to your selfe, all such servants of God who know and converse with you can discerne that God hath in great measure taken out of you the heart of stone and given you a heart of flesh, upon the tales whereof he hath written his holy Law, and that it is your delight to walke with him, to live to him and please

him in all things; yet did I never heare you bestow one good word upon your heart, but rather up∣on every occasion you are declaming against it, and complaining of its hardnesse and obstinacy. But Madam to feele hardness of heart is softness of heart, and did you but cleerly understand how much the Lord delights in such a frame of spirit as hee hath given you, you would cease to bee so suspitious as you are of your owne spirituall condition, and would spend the rest of your dayes rejoycing in your por∣tion and serving him without feare: I hope this plaine Sermon may through Gods blessing bee some helpe to make you judge more rightly of that grace which God hath so plentifully bestowed on you, and to blesse his Name who hath in great measure delivered you from this destroyer, even this plague of a hard heart; I humbly present it unto you, as a pledge of my thankefulnesse, for all the many and great refreshings I have found in your family, where I have constantly found your respect and tendernesse towards mee more like that of a mother then a stranger: The good Lord pardon my unfruitfulnesse among you, and requite you and your good husbands love toward me a thousand fold into your bosomes, and multiply his favours upon your whole family, and continue to guide you by his counsell till you come to his glory.
