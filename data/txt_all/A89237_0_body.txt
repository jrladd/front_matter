MY LORDS,
YOur importunate and joint desires, which my civility taught me to look upon as Commands, are now sa∣tisfied, and that hasty Piece which when you first called for it, was scarce legible, now waits upon you in a fairer hand. I cannot promise you with fewer errours, for 'twas never since sub spongia, but I am sure in better Characters; I wish it may but so happily take your eye, as you were pleased to signifie it took your ear, and be recei∣ved with the same candour and sweetnesse
from the Presse as it was from the Pulpit: I confesse I am not without some fear, that crosse to that of the Poet, the instructions in it will Segnius irritare animos, now they are, Occulis subjecta fidelibus, then when they were dimissa per Aures. But however this Discourse, as others of this nature, must take its fate; Your Ho∣nours called for it, and it being a Guest of your own invitation, I hope you will not deny to bid it welcome; as for its dresse of language, I cannot but judge it plain and without affectation; but yet, I hope, well enough accommodated to my Design, which was not to tickle the Ear, but in∣form the Judgement. I know Truth is then best apparrelled, when she shines in her own native Lustre, and she fears so much that of the wanton to be Ipsa pars minima sui, that she alwaies chooseth ra∣ther to affect the gravity and decent plain∣nesse of a Matron. I considered farther how that Vocum aucupes, they are usu∣ally Rerum proditores, and as the judi∣cious Rawleigh observes, Nihil odiosius sapientiae acumine nimio. Neither in∣deed was my Topick so jejune and barren, as that I should be forced onely to face it
with words for want of matter to line it thorow with. All that I dare promise or hope in behalf of this plain-dealing Coun∣trey-Sermon, is, that you will finde it, if not acute and Rhetorical, yet close and substantial, having in it the beauty of a word spoken in season, and being so ex∣actly fitted to the businesse of an Assize, That if your Honours please to take it as a Line and Rule in your hand when you are upon the Judgement-seat, it will help to render your judicial Proceedings level and regular. It begs nothing of you but the Patronage of Justice, and the pur∣suing of that as the main end of your Of∣fice; and that you would stand by your own Helena of the Law, and not suffer her to have a Rape committed on her by any of the sons of violence, in whom the Levelling humour is too predominant: should our Laws fail, we should then quickly return to the bed of Nature, where like Beasts the stoutest took all, and the weak should hold by no other Ti∣tle or Tenure, but that of Indulgence and Dispensation from the strong. I have no more at present, but only this good wish to leave with your Honours, that Justice
may meet with a better Oratour, and just Government with a stouter Champion, and better Arms to shield and defend its right, then is the unserviceable Pen and Tongue of him, who professeth himself
