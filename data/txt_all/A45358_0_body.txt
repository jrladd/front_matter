SIR,
TO prefix your Name to the present Treatise I could give many Reasons that induced me, did I not know that you are more delighted in doing Worthy Things than to have the Praise of your Actions re-echoed and repeated from others. And

since my choice and affection hath thus far led me, I am the less soli∣citous of the various Censures that a Discourse of this nature may pro∣bably meet withal: For even the clearest Reason does often lose its force when it meets with strong and inveterate Prejudices. However I have done my endeavour to make things appear plain and easie, and the better to comply with an Inqui∣sitive and Philosophical Age, have made use of such Principles as the best and choicest Philosophy could afford me; which as it is not in the least derogatory to my Profes∣sion, so was highly necessary to make good one great end of the Christian Religion, in delivering us from the Power of the Dark Kingdom, whose very Existence some smatterers in Philosophy have the Confidence to deny. Whether I please others or not I am not much concerned, having the sa∣tisfaction

of pleasing my self, in taking the opportunity of a grate∣ful Acknowledgment of your ma∣ny favours towards me, who am,
SIR,
