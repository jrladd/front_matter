My most Worthy Friends,
I Have had such Experience both of your Judgment and Candor, that notwithstanding the many false Reports and Papers industrioufly scattered by some of the less sin∣cere and less generous Romanists, I have trusted my Re∣putation with you. I was well assured that you would not pass any Censure till you had well understood the Case; and that Truth, tho it moved slowly, would over∣take that Falshood which made such haste to be before It. It is certain that the Discourse it self does not deserve the name of a Conference; for the Crowd and the Noise gave such an interruption, that the closeness of Discourse which was intended, could never take place: But there are other Reasons which move me to publish that which has passed, and without the doing of it, some unworthy ends would have been further served upon the credulous. I am not conscious to my self of any thing in which I have not been just or fair. What I said either with less Strength, or more warmth than I ought to have done, I have set down, and laid it before your Charity. It may be I have a motive to severe language towards that sort of men, which few have besides me. My Father being turned out of his Living of Mondesley in Norfolk, as an Adherer to King Charles the Martyr; a Person, one of whose names was Gubbard, recommending himself to the Committee at Norwich as a man who had a zeal for the same Cause in

which they were engaged, took Possession of the Living, and received all Profits, but restored nothing; and with Modesty he held the Living of Knapton also. After a few years he began to throw off part of his Disguise, and he Preach'd-up Purgatory, and other such points in so open a manner, that the same Committee who had put him in, turn'd him out again; and in a little time he (as it were) vanish'd away. Thìs instance of such gross Hypocrisie and Injustice made impression upon me when I was young, and so raised my Suspicion and Indignation, that where I have met with any thing of a like nature, it has been some difficulty to met to temper my self. But nothing (I hope) shall ever so transport me, as to prevent the doing of my duty among you and my Willingness to spend and be spent for a Pious, Steady, Generous and Affectio∣nate People, who have passed as high Obligations as man can have to man, upon,
My most Worthy Friends,
