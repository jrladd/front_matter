My very Good Lord,
MY last came to tell your Lord∣ship I had a great Ambition to be related unto so much Worth and Goodness; this to declare unto the world how happy that Relation makes me; and what my Obligations are unto your Lordship, to whose Instructions and Example, Discourse and Counsil (next to the Divine
Benediction,) I owe those small Im∣provements, which I have hitherto attain'd: and from whose Favours and Protection, I derive the Com∣forts & the Satisfactions of my Life, and the Encouragements of all my Labours.
But had I no such motives to in∣duce, yet Equity & Prudence would oblige me to lay this Essay at your Lordships feet, Whose Works suffici∣ently inform us, You are as power∣fully convincing, and happily suc∣cesful, in your divine Attempts a∣gainst those Great Leviathans, and proud Goliahs, who have defy'd the Armies of the living God, as in those Matters which alone admit of per∣fect Demonstration. Your Lordship
hath secured that Scripture to us, on which our Hopes and Happiness depend, and all our Arguments do bottome; and rendred Infidelity as base and scandalous, as it is hurt∣full to the Soul, by adding this unto the Sinfulness and Danger of it, that it must be now embraced and conti∣nued in, against the highest Reason & most clear Conviction to the con∣trary.

Besides, your Life and Conversa∣tion, as well as your Endeavours from the Press, and from the Pulpit, declare unto the World Your Lord∣ship hath the warmest Zeal, and the most passionate Affection and Con∣cern for Piety, and doth so vigo∣rously consult, so tenderly regard, and so industriously promote its In∣terests, that all attempts of such a na∣ture,
though not so happy in Ex∣pressions, nor so exactly managed, as the Concern and Moment of this Cause requires, may yet presume upon your Lordships Favour and Acceptance, even when they dread and deprecate, and find themselves unable to sustaine the Sharpness of your Judgment; and may hope, though Your more piercing Eye discovers many Spots, ill Features, and undue Proportions in so rude a Draught, Your great Affection to the Subject may draw the Veil be∣fore them. However I have great Ex∣perience that my Lord is Gratious even to the meanest and the least de∣serving, and that his Goodness is like his other Virtues, advanced un∣to
to the highest Measures, and there∣fore will extend it self unto
