THis Booke, (Good Sir) the issue of my braine
Though far vnworthy of your worthy view,
Yet I in dutie offer it to you
In hope you Gently it will entertaine.
And though the Method and the Phrase be plaine,
Not Artlike writ, as to the stile is due,
Yet is it voide of any thing vntrue,
And truth I know your fauour shall obtaine.
The many fauours I from you haue had
Hath forc'd me thus to shew my thankfull minde:
And of all faults, I know no vice so bad
And hatefull, as ingratefully inclinde.
A thankfull Heart, is all a poore mans pelfe,
Which, (with this Booke) I giue your Worthy Selfe.
