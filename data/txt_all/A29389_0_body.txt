Gentlemen,
THese Ensuing Reports, being brought to me in Manuscript (in the pecu∣liar Dialect of our Common Law) I discovered the same to be the Hand∣writing of that late Judicious and Honorable Person, Sir John Bridgman Knight, deceased, Serjeant at Law, heretofore Chief Justice of Chester (the memory of whose great Learn∣ing, and profoundnesse in the Knowledge of the Laws of England still liveth, although himself be dead) and thereupon bestowed some pains in the perusall thereof; wherein I found many things (in my weak apprehension) worthy of observation, which induced me to encourage the Translation thereof into our Na∣tive Idiome (the Language enjoyned by the present Authority onely to be Used in things of this Nature) whereby the same might become of publike Use; if any, well acquainted with the Authors Character, shall doubt the Credit of this Copy; they may have the sight of the Originall (the better to satisfie them∣selves) by the help of the Stationer. The Cases are not
 placed in time as the same were adjudged, but Printed in that order as they were found under the Authors own Hand; For this Defect, it is hoped, that the Table may make amends, which you will finde to be a perfect Repertory as to each materiall thing contained in this Book;) What faults have escaped the Presse, will lye in the power of the judicious Reader to correct. Mr. Bracton in his first Book, Cap. 2. saith, Si aliqua nova & inconsueta emerserint, & quae prius usitata non fuerint in Regno; Si tamen simi∣lia evenerint, per simile judicentur; cum bona sit occasio a similibus procedere ad similia. Let this serve to Apo∣logize for such encouragement as hath been given by me for the publishing of these Reports; I having no other aim herein, then the Publike good; Farewell.

Middle Temple, 5 Nov. 1658.
