PLato and Aristotle, the profoundest of
their times, thought the best educati∣on
to bee defectiue, without know∣ledge
in Musicke, and Cicero reporteth,
that although Themistocles was en∣dowed
with many graces, yet was hee
the lesse esteemed, being ignorant
thereof, and such regard hath all anti∣quity
had thereto that wee not onely find them to loue, but
practise it, for amongst the rest, Saint Augustine recordeth
that S. Ambrose Bishoppe of Millan, who ouerwatcht the
Church, (then vnder persecution of the Arrians) intertainde

the time with songes and Musicke, and though the death of
Nero,Tacit. was exceeding ioyfull to the people, yet was it much
lamented, that his excellency in Musicke, should perish with
him: which when I consider (Right Honorable) together
with the worthy approbation you haue giuen to many pro∣fessors
of the same. I am not onely encouraged, still to pra∣ctise,
but willingly to publish these songes, (as the badges of
my affection) to all posterity: And for, because those things
are most embraced; which men find approued, by the voice
of greatnesse, I therefore, ambitiously thought it best, to
single out your Honor, being best able to protect them, hope∣fully
assuring my selfe, that your spirites, (which are incom∣bred
with many cares) may a little bee delighted in the hea∣ring
of these songes, which if they may attaine, I your Ho∣nors
humble votarie, shall be highly fortunate, and there∣by
the rather perswaded to liue and die,
