THE purest liquor drawne out
of the heauenly fountaine of
SALOMONS inspired wisdom
I here (with all zeale of your
Highnesse seruice) in most hū∣ble
dutie, offer to your thrise
sacred Maiestie, vnder whose most glorious
Empire, hauing first receiued the breath of this
life: and by whose shining beames of most gra∣cious
gouernement, that life hauing tasted part
of the common comfort of your many happie
subiects, and peculiar fauor of your most prince∣ly
countenance: I cannot but as I acknowledge
all my powers of right to pertain to your High∣nesse
disposition: so to force my weake inde∣uours,

to testifie the sinceritie of the same. This
my present, which (in a rustie caske, in steed of a
golden cup) I haue ventured to purchase for
your Highnesse, is (I confesse) farre vnworthie
your Maiesties tasting of (though in the benig∣nitie
of Dauids spirit, I doubt not your Highnes
will accept the same,) which, as it is borrowed
from the labours of so mightie and worthie a
king as was Salomon the true Author therof, it
seems most fit the dedication to your Maiestie,
who in Empire being a peere vnto him, in ele∣ction
a partner, in happinesse a riuall, and in
wisedome a Sabian obseruer of his soundest do∣ctrines,
can perfectliest iudge, and will kindliest
(I assure my selfe) welcome this his child for his
fathers sake, which must be (and so I desire) his
onely grace. For with me it is true that in the
composition hereof, it fared as with more wor∣thie
Nehemias, when he attempted the repaire
of the holy Citie: who being oftentimes di∣sturbed
therein by the practise and malice of
Sanballat, Tobia and Geshem, was sometimes
forced to desist from his attempt, and in the end
to effect it with sword in one hand and mattock
in the other: so whilest common cares and do∣mestik

duties (the direct enemies to all ingeni∣ous
actions, and proper poyson) of pure inuen∣tion,
did many times confound my iudgement,
disturbe my leisure, & in a maner vtterly disable
my disposition for so waighty an affaire (remo∣uing
so often my hand from my mind, and my
minde almost from the affection of my heart) I
(with half my weak selfe) haue bene driuen thus
to peece together, this often broken off, & now
vnworkmanly perfected taske. VVhich yet (as
a well fauoured person, euen in meane attires,
seemes yet euer comely) will I doubt not shew
some excellencie of the cōposers spirit, though
it be not artificially clothed with borowed bew∣ties
frō my barren braine. And your Highnesse,
whose course of life so wel conformeth with this
his discourse (teaching vs your subiects by holy
practise, what he by deuine precepts instructed
his) may as iustly chalenge (me seemeth) the
publication of the like discourse: as we without
defrauding God of his honor, & your Highnesse
of your due, may not conceale the perfect re∣semblance
your Highnes hath of him in name,
disposition, and fortune: & we with his subiects
in honor, prosperitie and peace: which albeit,

we your inferior subiects (as the weake sighted
eyes which cannot behold perfectly the face of
the sunne, but looking downe in the water: nor
see his first appearing in the East, but by looking
for the shadow in the VVest) knowing our disa∣bilities
iudicially to obserue the cleare bright∣nes
of your shining vertues: referring to borde∣ring
Princes and attendant Peeres, the more fit
recording of the same: we take palpable assurā∣ces
of the blessed Spirit of God working in you;
by the like frute of peace, prosperitie and plenty
deriued by your Maiesties most excellent go∣uernement
and wisdome, vnto vs: whose first
worke of building vp the Church of Christ, pro∣uiding
for learning, restoring the decayd strēgth
and munitions of the realme, enriching the trea∣surie
of the land by refined coine, retaining with
most princely magnanimity, the ancient ample
bounds of your Empire, the establishment of so
many profitable factories for vnfrequented traf∣ficke,
the chargeable discoueries of so many vn∣known
parts, the honorable repulsiō of so many
foes, the bounteous purchase of so many neigh∣bor
friēds, the charitable relief of so many Chri∣stians
oppressed, the equal distribution of iustice

vnto all, (all tending to the glory of God, & pro∣speritie
of your raigne) do sensibly, without any
disparagement of the greatnesse of that mightie
Prince, draw on a certaine liuely comparison of
both your {pro}perties & blessings: which therfore
might excuse me of flatterie, if in a few words I
should point thereat. But I wil leaue the ampler
relatiō hereof to future posterities, & herein hū∣bly
crauing pardon of your Maiestie, for this my
presumption (which indeed hath bene founded
on your Highnesse gracious acceptance of my
former Passionate present) and recommending
them anew to your Maiesties fauor herewithall,
augmented and reformed; I will with all feruen∣cie
of prayer, cōmend your Highnes to the pro∣tection
of the Almightie: who as he hath confir∣med
your throne these (now nigh fortie) yeares
amongst vs, to the vniuersall peace and comfort
of his Israell the Church of Europe: so may he
redouble and continue euen to the end (if so his
Highnesse please) your Maiesties most happie
raigne ouer vs for euer.
