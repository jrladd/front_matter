Honoured Sir,
YOU may perhaps be surprised to find your Name Usurped by me, to Grace and Honour this trifle of a Sermon; unless you please to consider, that it is the usual Fate of Persons of your obliging Temper, to receive Persecutions of this Nature, as Returns of your Candour and Goodness: And I have only this to at one for the Presumption of this Dedication; that I thought no person so fit to Patronize a discourse of Goodness, as him, in whom all those bright Stars, that make up the Constellation, shine with so great a lustre.
Among all other Virtues which are resplendent in you, give me leave to trumpet abroad your exemplary Sobriety, which does approach so near to singularity in this age, that I can scarcely pay you your due praises, without a Satyr on most others; who, by their intem∣perate Quaffing, make their Houses, like those In∣chanted
Castles spoken of in Romances, which when a man hath once enter'd, there's no finding his way out again, by reason of an Inchanted Fountain there, the free Drinking whereof layes him and his reason both asleep: So that now a man can hardly avoid the Im∣putation of a Rude and Uncivil, unless he lose the Re∣putation of a Sober Man, and Sacrifice his health to the humour of his drunken Associates, and his Soul to the Devil, whose Factors they are, and for whose interest they drive on that drunken Trade: But to these inconveniencies no Person is exposed under your Roof, where tho nothing (that may speak a generous and hearty welcom) is wanting, yet you are a professed Enemy to all Excess; and your Visitants may say the same of themselves, which Socrates did of his Scholars, that they were well the next day. I have dwelt so long upon this part of your Commendations, not because you deserve not greater, but because I am not able to ex∣press them in other Subjects; like an ill Swimmer, I have willingly staid long in my own depth; and though I am desirous to perform more, yet I am loth to venture too far in the large Ocean of your Praises; least by my ill commending your other Virtues, I should so far incur your displeasure as to forfeit that Title, which I value my Self upon; Namely, That of

Ansty, Sept. 23th. 1687.
