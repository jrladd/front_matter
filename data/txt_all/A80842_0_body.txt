Endeared in the Lord,
I Present to the view of you all, what hath been plainly preached to the ears of such whose hearts God hath inclined to at∣tend on my publick Ministry. It is the chief and plain heads of
sundry Sermons without all Pul∣pit-repetitions, which would have swelled the volume too much; and without all flourishes of Fa∣thers sentences and citation of Authors, which might have made it nauseous to the mindes of such who judge things goodnesse by their plnnesse: the main scope and drift of it is to vindicate the dignity of a despised, and due au∣thority of a denied Ordinance of God; to revive in the Church an anciently exercised; and too too long exil'd priviledge; to excite and quicken to that too too long neglected duty of Catechizing in all Christian societies. This work I confesse hath been done by ma∣ny more able and eminent Mini∣sters of the Church, as holy Mr. Greenham, reverend Mr. Dow∣nam, acute Mr. Forde, and the reverend Provincial Assembly of
the Churches of God within the City and Province of London; many times I had it in my thoughts to have commended these to your reading, but fea∣ring what in that case I should de∣sire might passe in at one ear and out at another; and I being by some desired, and by the Pro∣vince enjoyned to preach on the nature of this duty; and having calculated the doctrine for your condition and capacity, thought it might most sure with you to put my own digested considerations into your hands; the which can∣not but be the more welcome to such whose ears heard them, and whose hearts were touched in the publique delivery: the acceptance of them by such is not to be doubted; and by all others it is desired, that they may be so farre accepted as to be taken up, read
without passion or prejudice; the Doctrine therein taught may be revolved in your deliberate thoughts; and prayer may be put up to the God of Wisdome, to open your eyes unto the appre∣hension and acknowledgement of the truth: This acceptance is the rather desired, for that
1. This little Tract is pre∣sented to you as a taste of that pity, and testimony of that true affection I bear to you in the Lord, as your Minister: against which though I strongly resol∣ved, yet providence hath so dis∣posed, that after all the sad changes, and Religion-ruining revolutions, to which the times have subjected you, you are com∣mitted to my care and charge, and I hope I can unfeignedly say, you are now my Dearly beloved and much longed for in the Lord.

2. This Tract travels in this publick way to seek out them, who by reason of the spirit of delusi∣on and prophanenesse, withdraw their ears from hearing it when preached; I thought it a duty to preach to the eyes of them whose ears are shut to such absolute Re∣ligion-preserving ordinances, as this is of Catechizing. I hope you have more charity then to suffer a Parish Childe born a∣mongst you to pass by your houses without one nights, nay a few hours entertainment: and I de∣sire none may appear so cruel, as to spurn and kick it out of their houses for the fathers sake, and the rather for that the father is to be found ready to traverse all inditements against himself or doctrine, if he may but en∣joy a patient hearing; but in spe∣cial take heed that none look
asquint at it, and carry doggedly towards it for propounding a du∣ty, and pleading for a piece of piety, for therein they engage the God of wisdome and holi∣nesse to plead his own cause. As for such as shall be ready to flight it on a seeming scrupulosity of con∣science concerning the novelty, or antiquity, or formality, &c. of the exercise for which it contends, I desire they will with patience read it through, it may be the re∣solve of their scruples may make them more esteem it.
3. The duty herein pressed, is that which concerns you all of what ever age or condition: Are you ignorant? Catechizing is the way to knowledge; and certainly, knowledge in rudiments of Re∣ligion, is an absolute duty incum∣bent on every man, be he rich or poor, high or low, young or old.
It is a very good observation the Provinciall Assembly have in their exhortation to the same duty, and I desire you may well note it, it is this:
It is the rare priviledge of the Romish Synagogue to have such a power over ignorance, as to command her to imploy her self as a tender nurse to their blind devotions; but the Church of Christ hath ever found her such a froward piece, as that she hath churlishly handled all the genuine issues of truth & piety; and as fondly cockered all the mis-shapen monsters of error, though never so strangely com∣posed of an heterogeneous com∣mixture of superstition and pro∣phanenesse. And as they, I must needs say, we cannot nourish our selves with the least hope as to see ignorance become serviceable to
true piety: we know the affecti∣ons cannot outgo the apprehensi∣on of truth, till she be known, can∣not be reverenced, cannot but be hated.
Are you knowing? yet Cate∣chizing concerns you not only in that thereby you communicated knowledge to others (according to your duty) but also the Cate∣chism is to you no lesse usefull then the compasse to the most skil∣full Mariner, to steer your course with method and order in these boisterous daies of confused noti∣ons, as a touchstone to the most discerning Goldsmith to try me∣tals, and detect the most glitte∣ring falsities that are spread before you with a Christ, Christ, as a rule to the most understanding Architect, by which you square your actions in the spirituall edi∣fice of your immortall souls.

Are you poor? Catechizing is a very cheap and easie way, in a few hours time, in two pence ex∣pence to make you rich in faith.
Are you rich? Religion will make you civill, literature will be your honour, and none so much as Catechism, which will be the very glory of a Princes Crown.
Nay not only doth the duty pressed, but the very pressing of it concern you all; and that in order to the quickning of your lukewarm spirits, convincing your very consciences of a duty to Ca∣techize and be Catechized: Hath not the long neglect of this exer∣cise to some, lost the divine stamp of it, and armed young men (when called to Catechizing) with impu∣dence to call its authority into question? how many stick not to call it an humane invention? how many others account it good, but
not necessary; allow it where it is used, but live without the discharge of it themselves, as if it concerned not them? if ever it had need to be pressed now with most power and plainnesse, pregnant and per∣swasive arguments; the youth of this age through want of Catechi∣zing, are captivated with Here∣sies and Schism; and if the neg∣lect be continued, the youth of the next will be capable of turning Pa∣gan or Papist; but in the past ages of the Churches by this very means, as you have heard and may read, young children were prepa∣red for Martyrdome in the defence of their Religion.
If any enquire and wonder that I preach and present to your rea∣ding so low, plain, common, and ordinary Doctrines in this high flown, wise and knowing age: I desire such to know, I am not in∣sensible
that the age in which we live, is an age of comforts, and that the now great enquiry of our Saints is after joy, not duty; assu∣rance, not assent of faith; but truly I study not what may please you, but what may profit you; the practises of holinesse in Word, Sacraments, and Sabbaths, are more for your profit then the pri∣viledges of a Christian: and whilest your heads are lifted so high, that you tread and trample under your feet the principles and positive duties (pearls of no small value) it is high time to set the lustre of them before your eyes, and to make wantons know sweet meats were not intended to work a contempt of common and or∣dinary food: and again, you have been too long pleased and puffed up with high flown doctrines: nay and the spirituall riches under
which you travell (I mean that heady disorderly knowledge, ut∣tered in free, but very confused discourses) makes me very jea∣lous they were not wholsome. Lastly, I have cause to fear that generally you cannot yet bear higher Doctrine; if God will, I shall leave the first rudiments, and go on towards perfection, when I have first laid the foun∣dation, you will do well to con∣sider some men (who desire to make the bounds of Christ his Church narrower then the Lord hath set them) hath under the notions of gathering Churches, stirred you in many parts and private congregations, and un∣churched (as much as in them lies) your whole bodies holding the place of a publick Minister, but neither owned nor discharged the duties thereof in your instru∣ction,
nor yet giving way for o∣thers to do it: nay, nor yet have they instructed the poor souls se∣duced into their societies: great is the ignorance in foundation principles I finde, and greater I fear amongst you; nor, when I consider how it hath been with you, do I wonder; but only this I say, how shall they be capa∣ble of the comforts that flow from the enjoyment of Christ, that are yet to be convinced that Christ is present to every beleever in the Sacrament, not on∣ly by way of efficacy, but also of reall existency, yet not corporall in a Popish sense. But I will hold you no longer at the threshold; the Doctrine I have preached to some, and printed for all, I tender it to you as a Minister of Jesus Christ; nay, as your Mi∣nister
set over you by the Lord, and watching for your souls, and desirous to give up my ac∣count of you with joy, and not with grief, as such and I, this small Tract so tendred, I beseech you, nay I charge you in the Lord, receive both me and it. I am not ignorant that some amongst you who are ready to deny the existency of Gospel Ministry, de∣spise it as Antichristian; deter∣mine the cry of holinesse suf∣ficient ordination, and the Mini∣stry to lie so common, that any man may (though to them none must) be manifest; and are so farre from subjecting, that they set themselves over others, bold∣ly Catechizing the Catechizers, will be ready to disclaim and deny any subjection or relati∣on to me, and dispute my au∣thority
as a Minister: But to such I say the Fathers authority is better exercised then debated amongst froward children. I have offered openly and do offer again to give to the sober dissatisfied soul (that will with patience and meeknesse hear) full satisfaction, not only concerning this, but all other principles, of which this Scepticall age hath caused them to doubt: I may not now stand to answer further, but invite them home, and in the mean time ex∣pect the duty pressed to be em∣braced, Catechizing to be resto∣red to your Families and Schools, your children and servants to be duly presented when called to this duty in the Church: and fervent prayers for a blessing upon it and upon me, that God would enable me to doe the work
which concernes your everla∣sting welfare; which is, and by Gods grace shall be sin∣cerely and fervently followed by
