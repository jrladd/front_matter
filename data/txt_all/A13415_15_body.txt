RIght worthy worthlesse Patron, the dayes and times being such,
wherein wit goes a wooll-gathering in a thredbare Iacket, and
folly is well reputed amongst those that seeme wise, I, conside∣ring
this, hauing but little wit, in a mad humour bade farewell it,
and neuer so much as asked the question, Wit, whither wilt thou?
Being certainly perswaded that playing the foole, will repaire the
reaches which my vnhappy wit hath made in the Bulwarke of my reputation
(as it hath done to many others) wherefore good sir (with) reuerence, I hearing
that so great a member in your esteemed quality, as M. Thomas Coriat of Odcomb,
was drowned in his passage towards Constantinople; and knowing that many
good and worthy writers haue graced his liuing trauels: So I haue made bold (vn∣der
your great Patronage) to write his tragicall supposed Death-song, or Funerall E∣legie,
not knowing any man of that worthy worth (besides your selfe) to whom I
might dedicate these sad Epicediums. Thus, not doubting of your acceptance and
protection, I commit my selfe and my labors to your wonderfull wisdomes cen∣ure,
alwaies hauing a poore Muse to trauell in your seruice.
