WOrthlesse sir, I present you with these my vnperfect labours, knowing that what defect in me or neg∣lect in the Printer hath left vnperfect, iudgement in you will winke at, if not thinke absolute. Being to turne a poore friendlesse childe into the world, yet sufficiently featur'd too, had it been all of one mans getting, (woe to the iniquitie of Time the whilest) my desire is to preferre him to your seruice: in which, as he shall be sure to get nothing, so likewise my hope is, he shall not loose much: For your bountie neither makes strangers loue you, nor your followers enuie you: you are a Patrone worthie the Sister-hood, I meane, the poore halfe dozen, for the Three Elders, they clbe aboue my element: the Sunne, the Moone, and the seuen Stars being scarce worthy the suruey of their workings: I protest I had rather bestow my paynes on your good worship for a brace of Angells certaine, then stand to the bountie of a Better-mans Purse-bearer, or a very good womane Gentlemā-vsher: my reason is I cannot attēd: your Bis dat, qui citò stands so like a Load-stone ouer your greate gate, that I feare, twill drawe all the Iron-pated Muse-mongers about the towne in a short time to your patronage. For mine owne part I had rather bee yours volens, then be driuen Nolens: So till I meete you next at your great Castle in Fish-street, ile neither taste of your bountie, nor be drunk to your health.
One of your first followers,
