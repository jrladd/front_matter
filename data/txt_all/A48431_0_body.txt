MADAM!
WHEN my unhappy Circumstances obliged me to retreat from Your Highnesses Person and Service, it soon came into my mind what engagements I remained still under, to testifie, as I had occasion, my sincere and Profound Respect and De∣votion to both; And that although I could not enjoy the Honour and Happiness of a near attendance, yet I should ne∣ver think my self emancipated and at liberty. The rare Good∣ness and Sweetness of Your Temper and Behaviour; The exemplary Piety, Virtue and Prudence of so exalted a conditi∣on have so powerful an influence upon all who approach Your

Highness, that nothing but a perfect inability can hinder them from serving You without any other reward than the honour and satisfaction of its performance and accep∣tance.
Persons of our Garb and Profession have seldom any better way of signifying our respect than a Book, sometimes our own, sometimes anothers; of the former I had none ready, of the latter it hath happened I had no contemptible one under my hand: A Divine of Your Highnesses own Country, A Son and Dignitary of the Church of ENGLAND; In one sort of Learning the most knowing perhaps of any Man in Europe, and the most enquired after in the Country where Your Highness now resides of any English Divine. Insomuch that most of these English Works are (as I am informed) Translating into Latine by some of our own Country-Men here and in Holland, as his Latine ones are here in England now Translated into English. These last, with some pieces in Eng∣lish never before Printed, are Collected into a Second Volume and with the first humbly beg the honour of admission into Your Highnesses presence. This will still more confirm Your Highnesses own Observation and the proof of Your High∣nesses own Closet, that no one Country hath and doth still more abound in Learned, Pious, Judicious, writing Divines, than ENGLAND. In Talking, Noise and Gesture, per∣haps they may be equallized or out done.
Not that I will answer for all, or perphaps a great number of Notions and Observations of the Author (that's enough to do for ones self): Some things were written when young; Some things were the Systematical and received Opinions of the

Times; But, generally speaking, as many useful and peculiar No∣tions are to be found in this Author as in most other.
I am not unsensible that although the Author be in English, yet not only the meanness but also the unsuitableness of such a Present to Your Highness, being so full of Hebrew and Chro∣nological Learning, may seem to want excuse enough: But first the greatest part of this Volume is the whole History con∣tained in the Scriptures, the most Venerable and Valuable for Antiquity, Certainty, Variety, Rarity and Use of any ex∣tant; and that so well Methodized and laid together, according to order of time, as to make it very easie and pleasant. And then for the Hebrew, as all other the Learned Languages, they are generally rendred into English, except the unusualness of the Writing, or the Emphasis of the Phrase, or some other such cause hinder. Finally for the Chronological part, The great Condescension and most obliging Freedom with which Your Highness is pleased to Treat those who have served You in my Quality, have given me opportunity enough to know so much, as notto doubt of Your Highnesses capacity to under∣stand and make use of it when You please. Besides the Dedi∣cation of this Authors Works thus Revised and Corrected to so Great, so Judicious and exemplary a Patroness of the Church of England, and so Illustrious an Ornament to it by Your Practise, seems a convenient expiation for (I had almost said) the innocent fault, or the unhappy mistakes of the Author in that kind; having through an excess of misguided Gratitude prefix't the Name of one of the Worst of Men (free Con∣fession may sooner gain pardon) to one of the best of his pieces.
I am not here to detain Your Highness any longer than with the addition of my unfeigned and uncessant Prayers for the im∣provement of those excellent Qualities already attained in so great a degree by Your Highness, of Religion, Virtue and Prudence, the proper Characters of great Minds who are to fill great Places; the Continuance and Preservation of Health; the Blessing of Posterity in Gods due time; the Encrease of all Prosperity here, and the Immortal reward of Pious and Virtu∣ous Souls hereafter. These I am sure have the concurrence of all who have had the happiness of knowing any thing of Your Highness; But are more especially due from him who hath had the Honour and Benefit too of attending Your Highness in Holy things, and still retains the just Ambition of ever continuing
