ALthough I know None, but a Sidney's Muse,
Worthy to sing a Sidney's Worthyness:
None but Your Own Anagram. LA:WROTH. AL-WORTH, Sidnëides,
In whom, Her Vncle's noble Veine renewes:
nd though I know (sad Nobles) to infuse
My fore-spent Drops into the bound-lesse Seas
Of Your deep Griefs, for your deer Ioy's Decease;
To Your full Ocean nought at-all accrues:
t, as the Floods Queen) Amphitrité daignes
To take the Tribute of small Brooks and Bournes;
Which to Her Bounty (that Their Streams maintains)
e humble Homage of Their Thanks returnes;
Accept These Sighes and these few Teares of Ours,
Which haue their Course but from the Source of Yours.
