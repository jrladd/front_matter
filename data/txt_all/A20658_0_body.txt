THE ancient Grecians (as Aristo∣tle
writeth) accustomed to erect
the Temples of the Graces called
Charites in the midst of their Ci∣ties,
to the ende that the Citizēs
might thereby be admonished of
Amitie, mutuall Beneuolence, &
Charitie: In regard whereof wor∣shipfull
friendes,) considering
with my selfe the imbecillitie of our nature, the malignitie
of mortall mindes, and the dangerous daies of this our yron
age, finding a lamentable defect of Friendship, and fearing a
finall fall & decay of the same; I, not wallowing in wealth,
being farre from the abilitie of building a Temple of the
Grecian Graces, haue according to my slender facultie fra∣med
a Figure fully fraught with the glorious gifts of a God∣desse:
more worthie to be purtraied with the cunning pen∣cill
of Protogenes, than so dimlie adumbrated with the run∣ning
penne of Agatharcus. Which if it deserue not to be sci∣tuated
in the midst of the Citie as the Grace Aglaia, nor to
bee placed on some high pinnacle as the Image of Miner∣ua,
yet it may be suffered in the corners and Suburbes of the
same in the honour of Amicitia. Through whose beneuo∣lent
aspect and goodnesse, some men may bee perhaps the
sooner moued to Amitie, Friendhip, and gratefulnes. We
read that Apelles by a picture caused the Aegyptians to ab∣horre

& hate derraction, as a mōstrous copesmate of vices,
& I wish this present Figure may be analectiue to our An∣glians
to entertaine & imbrace Friendship as a mightie cō∣panion
and aide to vertues. And forasmuch as Friendship
doth chiefly consist inter duos, and can haue no essence but
inter bonos, I haue been the more emboldened (although
vnknowen) to presume of your Worships fauourable ac∣ceptance
hereof: who, as popular fame pronounceth, as wel
for your accustomed curtesie towards all men, as also
for your continual Amitie and brotherly loue one towards
another in faithfull societie, doo rightly resemble friend∣ships
nature and propertie: to whome I humblie present
and offer the same. Wherein, if my presumption shal breed
preiudice, or cause me to be checked with dislike, I shal be
choked with despaire for euer practising my pen againe in
anie such petite pamphlet, yea though it were to my fami∣liar
frends. Thus wishing your Worships all manner of
temporall benefites, and spirituall blessings, I end and hum∣blie
take my leaue.
