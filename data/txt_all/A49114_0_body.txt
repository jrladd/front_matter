Blessed Saviour,
WHo hast put in∣to the heart of thy meanest Ser∣vant to vindicate one of the high∣est Ordinances, and hast in some measure given him strength to bring forth what thou gavest him grace to con∣ceive: Pardon (I humbly be∣seech thee) the weakness of

these endeavours, and pro∣sper them by thy Almightie Spirit, to the reviving of thine own despised Institu∣tion. Thou hast the hearts of all men in thy hand; re∣move, I pray thee, all igno∣rance and prejudice, all pride and partiality, all carnall in∣terests, and inordinate pas∣sions from their hearts, into whose hands these unwor∣thy labours shall come; and cause them, and the dayly prayers of thy Servant, to become effectuall through thy blessing, for the produ∣ction of that good end to

which it is intended: And let the Power and the Praise be onely thine, who bringest greatest things to pass by the weakest means, and out of the mouths of babes and suck∣lings dost ordinarily perfect thy praise. Suffer not (blessed Lord) the spirit of errour and division to prevail against those whom thou hast pur∣chased with thy blood; but let that blood be effectually applied unto them, to cleanse them from their sins, to con∣firm them in thy truth, and to cement them inseparably in brotherly love and unity:

That as we have One Lord, one Faith, and one Baptisme, so we may be all of one heart and of one mind in all things that concern the purity of thy worship, the peace and edi∣fication of thy Church, and may have all our requests, to∣gether with the Incense of thy Almighty Intercession, dayly presented unto our heavenly Father, in that gol∣den Censer which thou (in great mercy to our infirmi∣ties) hast consecrated for the offering up of the prayers of thy Servants; commanding us when we pray, to say, Our Fa∣ther, &c.
