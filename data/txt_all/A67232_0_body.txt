Dear Sir,
YOU Having laid upon me a necessity of publishing This Sermon, I have at last comply'd therewith, though I cannot conceive what could induce You to have been so earn∣est with me in This particular, unless it were the design of its composure; which being to perswade men to be true and obedient to the establish'd Government, it might upon That account the more easily meet with a favour∣able acceptance from You, whose constant Loy∣alty to the Crown, and unshaken stedfastness to the Church of England, have gain'd You not only the love and esteem of all good men,

but the particular Favour of Your Royal Ma∣ster, His Most Sacred Majesty; of which He hath given the World a sufficient instance, by continuing You High Sheriff of so large a County this Second Year, an Honour granted to few, and an Office which none can execute better.
That God Almighty may be graciously pleas'd to bless You, so as that You may still do Him and the King more Service, is the Hearty Prayer of
