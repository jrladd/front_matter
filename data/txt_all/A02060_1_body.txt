My Lord,
TO have presented this peece of Horse-manship to his Majestie by any other hand then Yours, had beene very improper; as well in regard of the place your Lordship beares, as of my respects to your Noble person.
Here is a subject (my Lord) worthy of your consideration, and the imployments of your thoughts even serious; for in this most generous Creature, next unto Man, con∣sisteth the pleasure, honor, and defence of a most flourishing King∣dome.
I have given part of my Youth to the investigation of this
 beautifull and usefull Creature; I have searched many Nations for my better information; and albeit I have found some Climates more Fortunate then this of Ours, in the production of a happie shape to this Creature, for the most part our Horses not being drawne out with such delicate Lineaments, neverthelesse some of them, I have (where care and diligence have beene used in the Breed) of most absolute, and perfect shape, and whereas frequent∣ly, the Barbary Iennet, Turke and Neapolitan Courser, are cryed up for their beauties, yet as in some shapes they excell, so in some other thy may be found defective.
But if we regard the Spirit, Vigor, and doing of a Horse, no Nation, or Soyle, produceth a more Active, then this our Iland of Great Britaine, as hath beene well experienced by many Noble and memorable Services.
Vnto which if we adde a due observation in our Breed, both on the one side of the Stalion or Sire, and the Damme, our lost glory will be soone recovered.
But since the laying aside of the great Saddle and Cannon, and neglect of the Horse of Menage, since the applying our Breed only to Racing, or, (as I may better say) in furnishing our selves with Horses of speed to runne away from our Enemy, the most ancient honour of Horseman-ship peculiar to this our Kingdome, and for which all other Nations highly esteemed us, is now almost va∣nished and lost; insomuch as were we pressed with thoughts of de∣fence (from which the most prudent and watchfull Eye of our most gracious Soveraigne, Guards us, through his most happie Government) we should bee forced (I write this in blushes) to to pull Horses from the Coach, and Cart, to fill up our Troopes.
Let it therefore bee recorded, (my Noble Lord) that whilest you were Master of the Horse to his Maiestie, an exact observati∣on was established throughout this whole Kingdome, for the due breeding of serviceable Horses; to the furtherance of which most Noble designe, if these my Observations shall, any way con∣duce, I shall blesse my Pen that it ever waded in such a subiect: professing my selfe to owe unto my Soveraigne and Countrey all I
 have, and unto them my Labours as a most loyall Subiect and true Patriot, I most humbly offer.
And my good Lord, these Observations gathered in my Youth, I was advised and pressed by some Noble Friends (though now old) to publish for the generall good of this our Kingdome: O∣therwise for my owne part I should have rather suppressed them, as not being now so fit a subiect for me to treate off, but the pub∣lique good hath over swayd me. Wherefore with these Oblations I Conclude, Kissing your Lordships Hands, and shall ever professe my selfe
