POndering with my selfe (right noble and worthie Lorde) howe J might by some meanes or waies, shew my selfe in any respect, partely to requite your Honourable Lo: great gentlenes and good coū∣tenaunce alwayes borne towards me from time to time, I could not holde my selfe satisfied, vntill I had some thing to present vnto your Lordship, whereupon I am so bolde as to dedi∣cate this rude and simple Treatise vnto your worthynesse, hoping that you will accept it, as a true token and a signe of my good will to∣wards your humble Lordship. The thing is such, as you haue already seene the written copie at

my good Lord and Masters hande the Earle of Lincolne: the content thereof is, as touching Inuentions or Deuises, and first of Martiall affayres by Sea, and concerning ships: and then doe followe deuises appertaining vnto Ordi∣nance: and in like manner Deuises of the walls of towns, Castels and Forts: and also there are Deuises as touching Martial affayres by land, with other such like, as the Contents of the ta∣ble in the beginning of the booke dooth shew. (I hoping that your good Lordship will take these simple and rude Deuises in good parte) beseech God to prosper your Honour in all your attēpts, and to giue happy successe in all your doings, with increase of Honour, and long life, in per∣fect health. Amen.
