COnsidering with my selfe (worshipfull Mistresse) the
due desert preceeding to your person, the perfect proofe
of pure preence, in supporting and holding vp of vertu∣ouse
exercises: was and is the occasion to incourag me
of presenting this vnto your view. I am though vnskilfull
yet not vnmindful of your deserts, which if I should take in hand
to penne, I were like him which  and  aduentured to
reade the Maze, And being in, could not finde the way ot a∣gaine,
but by long time and instruction. So if I should beginne to
write, I must haue both long time, and also instruction in learne
lore. This my present vnto you (being simply penned Intituled
The Chariot of Chastitie) hath beene by forgetfulnesse kepte
from my sight, and long hath lingered in the lodge of Lasinesse.
But when requisite remembraunce had deemed of Delay: Then
presently perswation  me to publish the same. But I stood
in doubt whether I might present it vnto you: waying the insuf∣ficiencie
of the deuice, but being imbouldened by  meaning, I
was incouraged, and as I haue presented vnto your worships hus∣band,
my simple Castell, making him patron of the same: So I
thoght it good to vnite you together. Selecting you for Patrenesse
of this my present, wishing vnto your Mistrishippe
as dutie bindes me florishing felcitie in this
life, and in the world to come
Heauenly hap∣pinesse.
