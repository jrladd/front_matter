Friends,
HOw greatly hath the Lord appea∣red in this day, in raising up many Instruments to sound forth his glorious Truth? yet many are not sen∣sible of it, nor of the great Work he is a doing, who is a setting up his Spiritual Kingdom, and is establishing Righteous∣ness in the Earth; and all those that op∣pose this Work, shall in im be ashamed, and the Lord will go on with his Work, who is come to restore Man into the pri∣mitive purity he was first created in: Man that hath been drove from him into the Earth, by reason of Transgressions, and been a Servant to sin, and under the power of Satan, and been ignorant of the Life of God, and of the sweet refreshments of his living presence, not knowing the
motions and leadings of the Father, nei∣ther hath his ear been open to hear the voice of God, but hath been without any sensible feeling of the Life and Power of God, and had no savour of the things of God. In this condition is Man, that is drove from God in the Fall: But now is the Lord come to restore him again by his beloved Son Christ Jesus, who re∣deems Man again from his lost estate, and brings him out of the Earth, and out of all such things which had sepa∣rated him from God, to delight in the Lord his Maker again; and from being a Servant of sin, to be a Servant of God, and of Righteousness and Holiness, and to bring him again into Innocency, in which he was first created. And this hath been the Work of the second Adam, the Lord from Heaven, in all that did receive him, and it is his Work at this day. The Father of Mercy and great Com∣passion, he hath considered Mankind who had corrupted his way, and he sent his Messengers to foretell the coming of the acceptable day of the Lord, and the day of Salvation of God, who invited all the
hungry and thirsty to come and drink at the Fountain of Life. And this was the free Love of God, to help Man out of the Pit wherein there was no Water, and to offer him the Wells of Salvation to drink at, that so he might be washed from sin and from pollution into which he was fallen, and could see no deliverer, till the Lord was pleased to open a door of Hope, and to set him free by his Son Christ Je∣sus, and to save that which was lost, and to bring Peace and Salvation; whose power is indeed as able to cleanse from sin, as ever the Devils was to defile and corrupt. This is true, and witnessed by some, though many cannot believe that ever any can be free from sin in this life. Now he that is in the first birth, and sees no further, but is overcome with sin daily, and his mind is earthly and corrupt, and has never known the power of God to work in him the New birth, and a change from his sinful Estate, he judges he can be no otherwise while he is here, and so is like a blind man, who though the Sun shines, because he cannot see it, he will not believe that it shines, or that others see it.
But this must not make the Faith of some void, who have known the second Adam to be a quickning Spirit, and have found him able to save to the utmost all that come unto God by him; and the bloud of Christ is to them of full effect, and they witness him to be a perfect Saviour: and indeed for this end was Christ given of the Father, and for this end came he into the World, and was made manifest, to de∣stroy the works of the Devil, and to save his People from their sins; and until Christ hath brought Man out of the Trans∣gression he hath fallen into, he hath not finished the Work that the Father hath given him to do; for as sin hath reigned unto death, so must Righteousness reign unto Life Eternal; and as through the power of Lust man hath been defiled throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit, so by the power of Christ is man to be sancti∣fied throughout in Body, Soul, and Spi∣rit; and being once cleansed by his power, to be saved from those sins which formerly have defiled him: and by this Man doth witness the Restoration by Christ, and the renewing by the Holy
Ghost into the Image of God again, which he had lost whilst in the Transgression; and so Man comes again into unity with God, and to know his voice, his motions, and the leadings of his Holy Spirit, which while he was in darkness, and served sin, he was wholly ignorant of.
This makes Man fruitful again unto God, who before was as a barren Wilder∣ness; and whereas he was before filled with Darkness, he now comes to be filled with Light and Life, and now he hath Visions and Revelations of Heavenly things: before he was crying, There was no Revelation nor Vision, they are ceased; whilst night was upon him he saw no Vision, and because he saw no Vision, nor had no answer from God, therefore he thought it was so with all others, and that Revelation and Vision was ceased; and he measured all men by his dark rule, darkness being over him, and his eye blinded.
Whilst he was in the first birth he was Earthly, his mind Earthly, delighting in Earthly things; he could not then believe there was any immediate Teachings of
the Father by his Holy Spirit, nor any en∣joyment of Heavenly things; neither was his eye inward, but to an outward Tea∣cher, and outward Books and Writings; but when the inward ear came to be opened, and the day of the Lord appea∣red unto him, then he heard the words of God, and saw the Visions of the Almighty, and then he began to praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his mercies which endure for ever.
And now being come to taste of the loving kindness of the Lord, and his heart being filled with Heavenly blessings, he ministers forth the same to others; and these are the true Ministers indeed, who are moved by this blessed power of God to seek the Salvation of Souls: And of this number was our dear Brother Stephen Smith, (now deceased) a man who laboured in faithfulness and constan∣cy, according to the ability God had given him, to beget others to the Truth; and was constant in Sufferings, in Tra∣vels and Labours, and had a good esteem in the hearts of many for his faithfulness to the Lord, as you well know, and there∣fore
I need not write much concerning him, especially since some others have written so largely of him, but shall re∣main,

London 28th. day, 3 mo. 1679.
