RIght noble Lady: The Church of God is compared by Salo∣mon to a terrible army, wher∣in are bands of strong men, and valiant Israelits, expert in the war, and that can handle the sword. And euery Booke of sacred Scripture we may call, a seuerall Armour-house, furnished better then that house of Lebanon, which Salomon stored with shields and Targets of Gold. In it are weapons of war, both in∣vasiue, and defensiue, armour conuenient for euery state of life, and meet for euery kinde of battell, wherewith our aduersa∣ries are able to assault vs. But as Dauids Woorthies were not all of one valour, for Abishai chiefe of the second three, yet di not attaine vnto the first three: So haue not all the Warriours of Christ a lik

strongth, & skil to fight the Lords battels And therefore we who are but nouices in the spirituall warfare, as wee should bee carefull euery day to put on the compleat armour of God, that wee may stand, so should wee diligently take heede to other valiant Wrestlers, who through Faith and Patience haue inherited the pro∣mises before vs, that wee may learne of them, how to weild our weapon in the spirituall warfare, Among many, whose battels are registred in the booke of God for our instruction, I haue here brought in worthy Iacob, a wrestler from the wombe, euen to the day of his death, who in this his singular, & most rare wrestling with God, let vs see an Image of Gods wrestling with his Children, the varietie of tentations, wherby he proues vs, and the meanes by which we stand. Sundry others before mee, haue written learnedly and largely of this subiect, but I haue labou∣red as farre as I could, to eschew coinci∣dent doctrine, and haue principally inde∣uoured my selfe, to search out such obser∣uations, as through experience, by the

grace of God, I haue found most comfor∣table for such as are exercised in consci∣ence. And these (right Noble Lady) I haue beene bolde to Dedicate vnto your Honour, as vnto one who hauing obtained mercy of God, is through his grace, daily exercised in the spirituall warfare. Ac∣cept it therefore as a testimonie of that loue and reuerence that I beare to that grace of God, which is manifest in you: for the encrease whereof I daily pray vn∣to God, that he would confirme you to the end, and bring forward his owne worke in you to perfection.
