My Lord,
I Expect that this Discourse which I here offer to your Lord∣ship should meet with A∣madverters; as soon as it peeps into the World; And if it be not en∣countred with rude, and Ruffian-like oppositions, it will fare better than some other Papers of mine whose de∣signs were as harmless, and inoffen∣sive. But whatever befals these

sheets, my Assailants shall sind, that I am none of those mean Spirits that will so easily be Hector'd into a Non-plus: No, but since my in∣gaging in such a Cause, makes them angry; I shall yet provoke them more; for I laugh at their vain boast∣ings, and despise their feeble malice. I invoke not your Lordships Patro∣nage by this Address; If I be in the right, Truth will defend it self; If not, 'tis in vain to sollicite Patrons. But, my Lord, I prefix your Name, that those may blush, who suspect the Practical Philosophy to be an Ene∣my to Religion; And since custom hath made this a Testimony of Re∣spect, I do it also to declare that I am,
My Lord,
