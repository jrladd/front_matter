AS I doe account it a great por∣tion of happines to haue re∣ceiu'd first Instructions, Ex∣ercise, and Encouragement of my Studies in this Auncient and most Famous City: So am I thereby bound, and doe (willingly) endeuour my best pat and power, both to testifie and augment the Life and Honour of this Liberall Science which I

proesse, to the benefit of all Students therein, and the contentment of all Affectors thereof in this my natiue Country, and especially in this the Metro∣polis thereof, which gaue first life and breaching to my poore Endeauours. And herein I must, and doe acknowledge it as a singular helpe and benefit, that I haue receiu'd diuers Instructions, Resolutions, and Confirmations of sundry Points, and Praecepts in our Art, from the Musicke Readers of that most famous Colledge, founded and erected by the euer praise∣worthie, and iustly renown'd Senator Sr. Thomas Gresham; who bearing his neuer dying Name, as a Praesident and Patterne to his Co-Citizens, to shew them the right way to aeternize their names to fu∣ture posteritie, by being kinde Nursing Fathers to good Literature, Reued the liberall Arts and Scien∣ces, especially the Mathematickes, which were some∣what neglected euen in the Vniuersities; and en∣dowed them with such Maintenance and exhibi∣tion, that (their worldly wants being more then meanly supply'd) they haue and doe continually striue with highest Art and Industry, so to explaine them to the world by way of Lecture, and other∣wise, that much good from thence redoundeth to many desirous of those Knowledges, and more and more will, as time and occasion shall serue. What fruits my selfe in particular haue receiu'd

by that one particular Lecture of Musicke (where∣of I was an vnworthie Auditor) I dutifully acknowledge to haue proceeded from that Col∣ledge; and doe heere Commende and Dedicate them to your Worshipps, Who are Visitors and Guardians of that most famous Foundation, from whence I haue receiu'd such benefit in these my studies. For as I haue beene encouraged by your Noblenes to trauaile in these Studies, so by Dutie they belong to You, from whome they had their Animation. May it therefore please your Worships to accept this my Discourse of Musicke with some Harmonicall Ex∣amples thereof, as a Simple Sacrifice, in part of that deuotion and seruice which I owe, vpon promise and full intendment by your wonted goodnes and asistance, to search for Richer and riper Disco∣ueries in this Musicall Continent. So wishing the long Continuance of your carefull Loue, and lo∣uing Care to al good Learning, especially to Musicke, the earthly Solace of Mans Soule, I euer Remaine
