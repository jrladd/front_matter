MADAM,
THE Stork (they say) in
sign of Gratitude, leaves
alwayes some of its
young to the house where it builds
its Nest. This Gratitude I strive to
imitate in these Pieces of mine,
made (most of them) under your
Graces Roof at Welbeck: And if I
appear too presumptuous to De∣dicate
so little and worthless a
Work as this, to your Grace, who

writes so Great and Worthy
Ones, I hope in your Good∣ness,
Madam, you will pardon
me; for to whom should the
Little flye for Protection, but
to the Great? And the worthless, but
to the Worthy, to dignifie and ho∣nor
them? Accept then, Madam, I
beseech you, this small Acknow∣ledgement
of his Infinite Obliga∣tion
unto your Grace, who shall
rather dye; than not live
