SIR,
IT was not my Wifes Consanguinity with you; but your own Innate vertues and worth, that cast me on this Anchorage.
I can't think this small Present worthy your Ac∣ceptance; However, I have thrust through the Press to beg that Fa∣vour: And I hope, not∣withstanding my rude in∣truding it on you without notice, you won't refuse (which will be a farther Ingagement on me) what comes Humbly, Sincerely, and Cordially from him, who unfeignedly, and (San's Complement) is intirely
SIR,
