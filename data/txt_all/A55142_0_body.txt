My Lord,
FOr the same Reason others usu∣ally pretend in choosing the Pa∣tronage of Great Men, I should industriously decline your Lordships a∣bove all Mens, I know; viz. For those Extraordinary Abilities, and great Judgment your Lordship's Master of. I should never be able to excuse to my self the Vanity and Presumption of this Address to a person of far infe∣riour Characters to your Lordship, had you not first discovered your in∣clinations to Accept it: Then it be∣came my Duty. I must confess, I never did value my self upon any thing so

much, as your Lordships favourable Estimation; and should do it more, if I thought the performance might answer or deserve it. If in doing my self this Honour, I have not disserv'd the cause therein Asserted; nor your Lordship sink by it, in the Venerati∣on all Men had before of your exact judgment; I have exceeded my own hopes.
My Lord,
