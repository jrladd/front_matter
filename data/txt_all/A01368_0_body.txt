I Should haue byn most gladde to print your name at large, and in capitall Letters, in this front of the Dedication; vvhich might haue passed for some

little testimony of the much seruice, that I ovve, & desire to pay you. But insteed of doing you seruice, I vvould be sure not to do you displea∣sure: and vve are fallen into so miserable tymes, as vvhere∣in I might better cheape in∣treate you to protect some thiefe or outlavv, then to pa∣tronize a vvorke that tends to the honour of our B. Lady. It shall therefore suffice that heerein vve knovv the mind of one another. And although there vvas no remedy, but I must needs spare to mention your name; yet I could not

thinke of fayling to addresse the Treatise to your Fauour. Both for the entiere deuotion vvhich you carry to the Glo∣rious Queene of Heauen (and that of the best kind, because it leads you to as exact an i∣mitatiō of her high Purity, as euer I haue discouered in any creature of your condition & vocation:) & besides for that this Patterne vvas most due to you, to vvhome the vvhole Peece of that belongs, vvher∣by I may any vvay acknovv∣ledge the noble Fauour of a most vvorthy and vvell deser∣uing Friend. I hope you

vvill excuse it for his sake by vvhome it is vvritten; nay I knovv you vvill esteem it for her sake of vvhome it is vvrit∣ten. And I hope, that both you, and I shall one day be so happy, vnder the patronage of this immaculate Virgin, the Mother of God, as to dis∣couer, and behould that in∣cōprehensible Glory, vvhich she obtayned by cooperating vvith Gods incomparable Grace.
