WHer as I haue seen your Ladi∣ship accept, such holy and ver∣teus exercises, and holde them in great estimacion, and conster all faul∣tes escaped by the print to verteus inter∣pretacion: taking the meaning, and not the letter; so I hoope your holy vse vvil∣be a meane, that I shall not be alto∣geither disliked of such vvhos handes hit cometh vnto: But as I ashure my selfe, all banished parsons liuing for one cau∣se, vvil not dispise good thoughtes pro∣cedinge of holy desiers, and especially thos, vvhos vvisdoms knovv hovv hard it is to print our languaig, in a strāge coun∣trie vvith out faultes: vvich maketh me so farre presume apon all holy Catho∣licke persons, especially such of honora∣ble consideracion, and haue so long ly∣ued à banished lief for true religions sa∣ke: as your honor hath donne this 17 Yeres. In this consideracion, I presume of all good Catholickes, that they vvill esteme of my meaning, and not the let∣ter: as I shall not cease dayly and orderly to praye for all estates, trusting in IESV, he vvill hear a poor pilgrome and banis∣hed parson: for his righteousnes sake:
that hit shal please him to conuert our poor countery, vvher vve maye praye togeither, liue togeither, and die togei∣ther, to the end vve maye be partakers of his heauenly kingdoome, vvher God the father, God the sonne, God the holy ghost, is glorefied: vvher the blessed Vir∣en is crouned, vvher Angels, Saints, and marters reioys, at our repen∣tance; for wich I daily praye to be geuen to all sin∣ners sayinge.
Pater noster, Aue Maria.
