MADAM,
I Have consider'd, but could not find it lay in my power to offr this Book to any but to your La∣diship. Not only in regard of that honour and esteem you have for Musick, but because those Songs which fill this Book have receiv'd much lu∣stre by your excellent performance of them; and (which I confesse I rejoice to speak of) some which I esteem the best of these Ayres, were of your own Composition, after your Noble Husband was pleased to give the Words. For (although your Ladiship resolv'd to keep it private) I beg leave to declare, for my own honour, that you are not only excellent for the time you spent in the practise of what I Set, but are your self so good a Composer, that few of any sex have arriv'd to such perfection. So as this Book (at least a part of it) is not De∣dicated, but only brought home to your Ladiship. And here I would say (could I doe it without sadness) how precious to my thoughts is the memory of your excellent Mo∣ther (that great example of Prudence and Charity) whose pious Meditations were often advanced by hearing your Voyce. I wish all prosperity to your Ladiship, and to him who (like your selfe) is made up of Harmony, to say nothing of the rest of his high Accomplishments of Wisdome and Learning. May you both live long happy in each other's, when I am become Ashes, who while I am in this world shall be ever found,
Madam,
