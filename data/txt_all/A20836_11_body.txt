MY very gratious and good Mistris, the loue and duety I bare unto your father whilst he liued, now after his decease is to your hereditarie; to whome by the blessing of your birth he left his vertues. Who bequeathed you those which were his, gaue you whatsoeuer good is mine, as deuo∣ted to his, he being gone, whome I honoured so much whi∣lest he liued; which you may iustly challenge by all lawes of thankefulnesse. My selfe hauing beene a witnesse of your excellent education, and milde disposition (as I may say) e∣uer from your Cradle, dedicate this Epistle of this vertu∣ous and godly Lady to your selfe; so like her in all perfecti∣on, both of wisedome and learning, which I pray you ac∣cept, till time shall enable me to leaue you some greater mo∣nument of my loue.
