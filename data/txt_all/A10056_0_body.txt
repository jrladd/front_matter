REligious & most Gratious Prince, let me craue pardon for my pre∣sumption, in offring that vnto the eie of the world, which I late∣ly preached in the eare of your Highnesse. The vnde served & vnexpected attention, and for∣mer acception of these labours, haue drawne this little gift, in representation of my re∣membrance therein: VVith this, I present my selfe and service, being ever ready with all my power to doe your Highnesse the humblest duty, thinking my selfe happie, when I may performe any thing which may testifie my true, zealous, and dutiful affection. Your highnesse hath already cunning Aholiab, and Bezaleel, sweet singing David, Parable speaking Ecclesiastes, Sinne smiting Micaiah, Ionas powerfull for Contrition, Peter potent for compunction, Barnabas singuler for Consolation. These all haue dedicated and consecrated their labours to the building of Gods temple in you: For my owne part I confesse I am not able with these, to bring taches, or rings, or earings, or bracelets, or iewels of gold, or Onix
stōes, or Sittim wood, or ointmēts, or spices, or perfumes, but the little oile which I haue, I desire to present for the light of the Temple. Your Grace is the comforte of the old, the hope of the young, and the ioy of all, tanquā ad clarum & beneficum sidus certatim ad volant, they striue to flocke to your Highnesse as to the comfortable starre of their happinesse, wishes, praiers, presents, be their offrings. VVith me it is worse then with many, I haue nothing to present, vnlesse as Eschines did to So∣crates, I should present my selfe, and ah las in my selfe I finde that there is such a disproportion betweene a pre∣sents worthinesse▪ and my weaknesse, that even in this, I had beene disanimated, had I not beene by your gratious favour encouraged. It now remaineth, that in the hū∣blest manner I can devise, I wholy resigne my selfe, stu∣dies, labours, endeavours, & course of life to your High∣nesse protection and disposition, craving pardon for my boldnesse, and ever praying for your Highnesse blessed∣nesse, that you may be truly gratious in this life, and tru∣ly glorious in the life to come.
