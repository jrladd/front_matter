 Sir,
THough he that writes as the Porcu∣pine shoots his quills in a passionate mood as I do, cares not much for the frowns of the muddy-pated multi∣tude: yet the number of Censors in our Common-wealth being greater than that of all Officers, my Mute would gladly repose under your shadowing Lawrel, that a flash of fierce displeasure may less

dismay her. Yet why should any Reader bend an angry brow at me, that have not spotted one page here (though it may otherwise seem) with any ebulliti∣ons of a private spleen; For though I have not seldome been surcharged with injuries, yet have I learned to digest them with my daily bread, and to think it more noble to contemn them, then to confess their power by meditating a re∣venge. Nor can I approve that bold speech of the sententious Poet, as car∣rying too venomous a sting in it:

Great Heaven fall on me with broad roof of
brasse,
Which to the Ancients a (just) terrour, was
If I help not my friends, and bring not those
To sorrow and distresse that are my foes.
It must needs be granted that Satyres

are not very seasonable, when all sorts of vices (the foul dregs of war) are setled into an unwonted impudency, and not onely some antiquated evils revived, but others also added to their hateful number, that came but lately steaming out of th'infernal Vaporary. I can hard∣ly in times so foully vitiated expect any fair construction of my Poem: nay, ra∣ther do I look that some squint ey'd Ma∣levolo's, whom I never came within a Bow-length of, will be busily shooting their bolts at me. But I shall lightlier regard such squib-like artillery, if more solid and less censorious men, such as your self (Sir) are known to be, will but illustrate my lines with the beams of their favour. You are an heir to great Wits as well as to large Revenues, and have made proof thereof in so eminent a manner, that all men behold you as an object of admiration. As others there∣fore look up at you, be you pleased to look down at me, and to take in good part these tart fruits of my labours, inten∣ded for condiments to your sweeter stu∣dies.

You are furnisht (I hope) with as may vertues as here are vices; and I with you as much happiness to crown them, as possibly can be fancied by
