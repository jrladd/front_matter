Most worthy SIR,
SƲch and so extraor∣dinary are your Fa∣vours, and so freely conferr'd upon me, that I must needs acknowledge I am in a strict manner oblig'd to all op∣portunities of humble Grati∣tude. Whereupon (not without some praemeditation) I have thought sit to take this, and have adventured to publish to
the world the Lives of these HOLY MEN under your Patronage, who indeed for a kind of sympathy between you and them, doe the rather owne you for their Patron: For if you please but seriously to pe∣ruse them, you may in many things read your selfe, and find wherein you have made them the pious Presidents of your own good Works. Of those, as you well know, my selfe have had no little experience, a Theame too on which I might well inlarge my selfe; but in∣deed
such is my unhappinesse, I want those abilities, either by more excellent Art of Lan∣guage to expresse them, or any other way of service or respects to testifie sufficient thankeful∣nesse. What need I then adde more, seeing this little already said, though but meane, and ac∣cording to my duty, is I am con∣fident above your expectation, so little doe you delight in the resitall of your kindnesses, or desire they should bee thus brought to your Remem∣brance: your expectations as in
a sutablenesse to your Christi∣an Vertues, await higher Re∣wards with those Pious Men before mentioned, that as you have endeavoured to imitate their Lives so you may also par∣take with them in their Eter∣nall Happinesse; for the fru∣ition whereof, hee shall daily pray, who in all duty subscribes himselfe, Sir,
