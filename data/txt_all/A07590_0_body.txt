GReat is the force of Ver∣tue, (worshipfull) which causeth those that there∣with are beautified, ofte times to be praised, lo∣ued, and wondred at: e∣uen of such as neuer sawe them. Among which golden number (for there be not ma∣ny such now liuing in this our iron age) I cannot but deseruedly account your wor∣ship: hauing heard you so notably com∣mended and well spoken of, not so much for your very good naturall inclination, as for your other extraordinary dispositi∣ons of vertue: and namely for your liberal∣tie, curtesie, and affablenesse towards all sortes and degrees of people. These with o∣ther your honest and rare qualities: as your vpright dealinge and iuste demeanure
in ciuill affaires, are meanes that neuer faile to purchace fauour among the wel inclinans: and therefore being in you both so manifest and manifold, they cannot but giue grace among the wel disposed. In consideration whereof, I among the rest (as one of the most that may doe least) haue reuerenced your name, and often haue wished some iuste occasion to befall me whereby I might finde the meanes to testi∣fie that good will in open action towards your worshippe, which along time in se∣crete cogitation and thought I haue borne to so good a Gentleman. And now (in a happie time be it spoken) I haue taken opportunity, as conueniently it fell out, in signification of my foresaid goodwyl which is far inferiour vnto my slender and weake abillity, to vndertake the presen∣ting of your worship with this small dis∣course, being a mirrour, or looking glasse, wherein all are aduertised and taughte, not only what dueties of humanitie the most excellent name of friendshippe doth mutually require; and would continually
to be practised among men: but also what course a man is to keepe and take in the election and choyse of a friend: Wherein such as be wise will (no doubt) be circum∣spect: knowing that a faithfull and in∣ward friend is to be reckoned one of the most precious ornaments and necessary in∣struments belonging to this our variable life, and that without it (no more then the body of man without sinewes and ioynts the societie of men cannot consist. Thus much in breuitie, touching the argument of this booke, by way of induction to the treatise it selfe: which because it will sufficiently commend it selfe to those that be of iudgment able to discerne, I will con∣ceale whatsoeuer I might most iustly re∣cord in praise thereof. Beseeching your worship, whome (among all other) the rea∣sons afore said haue moued me to choose for the countenancing of the same, being (I must needes confesse) in respect of the valure vnworthy, but in consideration of the vse most worthy to be dedicated vnto your worship: perswading my selfe, that
you are none of those that esteeme the price of thinges by their outward barke, but by the inward pith: for the eie may faile in iudging, but the minde (if it be not distempered) doth sildome misse. Re∣ceiue this litile treatise therfore (I beseech you) with fauour answerable to my good will, and as your leasure shall serue, be∣stowe nowe and then an houre or twaine in the reading therof: which if it please you to doe, I doubt not but you will like well of the labour: and besides the honest recrea∣tion which it affoordeth, applye what your iudgment maketh choise of, vnto your priuate vse, And thus wishing prosperi∣tie to your worshippe, acceptation to this my gifte, and a good opinion of the giuer. I conclude: hoping that mine ho∣nest wish shall not bee voyd of an happie issue and successe.
