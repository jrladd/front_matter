HAuing alōg tyme deba∣ted with my self (my very good Lady) after the co∣pie of this Pamphlete was come into my handes, too whom I might best dedicate the

same, your L. at laste came to my remembraunce, as the Ladie too whom I did knowe my self to be so greatly beholden, by many re∣ceiued courtesses, that I could not but confesse my self bound to be mindfull of requitall, to the vt∣termoste of my power, and there∣fore notyng the title that it bea∣reth, beyng the Mirrhor of Mo∣destie, I knewe none so worthie, (at leaste to whom I was indet∣ted of duetie) as your Ladiship to be patronesse hereof, because that the vertue whereof it beareth the title, dooeth so gloriously shine in you, as verie Enuie her self can∣not but confesse (muche rather a right demyng mynde) that it is your desarte to haue it, bothe for affirmyng that whiche is contei∣ned therein (by your life) to be lau∣dable,

and also to incorage other by your supporte to followe your stepps, to attain to your atchiued fame. Wherfore although the gift be far vnable, to gratifie the least part of the fauour I haue found, yet I haue boldly presumed too presente it vnto you, as beeyng assured (consideryng your cour∣teous Nature) of courteous ac∣ceptation, and the rather because it is a Mirrhor to teache Mai∣dens to be Modest, whereof you haue alwaies been a Mistresse, and therefore maye the better iudge if it bee well wrought, by perusyng it at your beste leasure, whiche not doubtyng but ye will dooe. I cease from further trou∣blynge you, with my duetifull commendations, and daiely in∣tercession to the Almightie, for

the happie estate, and prosperitie of your Ladishippe, that am your worshippes moste boun∣den E. W.
