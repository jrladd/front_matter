May it please your Lordship,
THIS History
(Written Ori∣ginally
in La∣tine
by a No∣ble
Hand, na∣tive
of that Kingdome) was

like a Treatise of that de∣serving
quality, addressed to
the Hands of two Illustrious
Persons, whom the Transla∣tour
(sure of doing the Au∣thour
no injury in this parti∣cular)
hath represented in your
single SELF, to what ad∣vantage
of Lustre the World
shall speak.
For (my Lord) it is not
the design of this Dedication
to bring water to the Ocean,
(although the Ever-flowing
Tribute that is due to Ver∣tue
is natural and necessary)
both because this streight and
shallow, will not boast or

presume to be proud of any
Additament to Your Fame;
& for that this Candle in such
Day-light will prove but a
faint and unobserved Glim∣mering
of that full Splen∣dour.
Actions and not Words,
have entertained the greatest
part of your Life, till the
late blessed Change, which
shall never be mentioned but
with Your Name;
Pax nescit COMITIS
non memor esse sui:
Insomuch that your Lordship

is a living Epitome of our
late War, and is read by
most men with Delight and
Admiration.
Vpon that account it is
(my Lord) that I humbly
present to You this FLO∣RUS HUNGARICUS
and Abridgement of their
History, not knowing with
whose Sum of Glory this
Compendium of so renown∣ed
a Nation would better
sute; for from the Founding
of their Empire, Time hath
had few respites, and but
momentary vacations from
Military Affairs.

In which Speculation (my
Lord) I am so much assu∣red,
that you are frequent∣ly
Conversant, and famili∣arly
please your Self in
that Heroical Diversion,
that I could not restrain
the Ambitious Tender of this
COMMENTARY; which
although very uneven, and
abrupt of Stile (as could
not be avoided in such a
pent and narrow inconve∣nience
of Expression) yet
it hath plainly conveyed and
continued the story.
The Endevour, what
it is, is most humbly sub∣mitted

to Your Lordships
Iudgement, and most sub∣missively
begs Your Pro∣tection
and Patronage, under
which it doubts not to find
acceptance with the World.
(My Lord) I am
Your most Humble
and Obedient Servant
