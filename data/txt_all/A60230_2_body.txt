May it please Your Majestie,
I Had not presumed, to present this Poem to Your Majestie's view, had I not believed, the Dignity of the Subject might, in some Measure, plead my Apologie. I know Your Majestie is familiar with the History, in its plainer Dress of Prose; but this Authour being frequent in the hands of few, but those, whose business is Books, I have adventured to make him English; believing (since, to my strictest Observation of Historians, he does not, in the main, deviate from the granted Truth) that his Poetical Fancies do not only ad Lustre, but a more then ordinary Pleasure to the Story; for herein all the most eminent Actions, in that famous VVar (which once disputed the Em∣pire of the Universe) are described, with so vi∣gorous, and lively a Flame, that (if my English hath not too much depressed it) it may create in the Readers an emulation of the renowned Performers: which I have not presumed to

present to Your Majesty (who are above them) as Examples for Imitation, but that, by reflect∣ing on them, Your Majesty may see what un∣perishable Monuments Great Persons may build to themselves, in asserting their Country; and, that as Your Sacred Person is endowed with all those Virtues, that rendred the Vali∣ant HANNIBAL famous, or SCIPIO a Con∣querour: so, by the blessing of Heaven on Your Majestie's Designs, some happy Pen may have Matter to build you such another Monu∣ment for future Times; and that Your Maje∣stie's Kingdoms being Restored to their for∣mer Glory by Your Hand, Posterity may date their Happiness from Your Conquest; and Your Name become an eternal Terrour to Rebellion.
So prayes,
 Bruges,
Novemb. 18th. 1657.
