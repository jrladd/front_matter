My LORDS,
YOƲR Lordships having ex∣press'd a desire, that the Dis∣course You were pleased to hear with patience at the Assizes in Cornwall, should be made publick; I have ad∣ventured it into the World, upon no other ground, but in obedience to Your Lordships Commands, and in hope of Your favourable Protection;
which as it must wholly proceed from Your own Goodness and Generosity, and is not pretended unto by any me∣rit either in the Author, or the thing it self; so I trust it will be a clearer Instance of Your Lordships Endea∣vours to promote any thing that may tend to the good of the Publick: and it will also lay a greater obligation upon
April 10. 1686.
