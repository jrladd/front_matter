MOST vvoorthy sir, no sooner did this stranger my friend set foot on English shore, but being desirous to trauail North, I could not devise vvhere he should finde more condigne & respectiue intertainment then vnder your most fauourable roof. It appears by his many languages, namely Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, high & lovv Dutch, and novv lastly English, that he hath sometimes bin a traueler. And so indeed if you examin him throughly, you shall finde he hath, asvvell by sea as by land. In his discourses he is vnlike the greatest part of our trauellers, vvho vvith their tedious & fabulous narrations vvill bring either deafnes to your eares or slumber to your eyes. But this man speakes nothing but matter, and that so succinctly, as by his conference you may reap delight, & yet not hinder your affaires of imâˆ£portance or recreation. Giue him incouragement in the North, and ere long you shall see him come ouer in another habit, to try vvhat acceptance the south vvill affourd him. Thus doing, you shall not onely grace him & benefit your country, but in all dutifull seruices you shall make mee his poore vvel-vviller,
