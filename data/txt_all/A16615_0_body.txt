RIght Honorable and most Christian Senat, as at your last Session, there were certayne Arguments directed unto You for the quickening of your godly Zeale to speake, not onely boldly, but also in all humilitie to the Kings most excel∣lent Maiestie, for the Ministers suspended and deprived for not Subscribing and Conformyng themselues to some present Consti∣tutions, and as ye did graciously accept of the sayd Arguments, and most worthily acquite your selues to the utmost of your po∣wers, touching the matter pleaded for by them: so now vouchsafe (I most humblie beseech you) the like favorable acceptance of a sober, modest, and iust defence of the same Arguments against a late uncharitable, unchristian, bitter, calumnious, and cavilling answer, published under the title of A consideration of them by M. Gabril Powel. I am bold in steed of the author himselfe of the Arguments, to take the defence of them upon me, and to pre∣sent them to your Honors, because M. Powel himselfe in his said pretended answer unto them, hath so often referred the iudgment of the Arguments of his consideration of them, and of the whole cause, to your most graue and gracious company. Yea, there is nothing that I am more willing unto, or which I doe more ear∣nestly desire, then that the cause betwixt M. Powel and all those for whom he pleadeth on the one parte, and the author of the Ar∣guments and me the defendant with all other in whose behalfe we speake on the other parte, might be iudicioussy and equally heard at the barre of your most Christian Court. But the truth is, be∣cause
 we desire and endeavor this, hinc illae lacrymae. Hence is their chiefe hatred of us, their great contention with us, and their bitter writing against us. Notwithstanding though now we be un∣iustly charged as writing from Cimerian darknes, for concea∣ling our names; yet if publike libertie might be granted to both parts, to stand before your iudgment seat, there freely to plead & debate the cause by the word of God, and that neither the worldly might and pompe of our adversaries, nor our meannes and base∣nes might be respected, but the truth it selfe simplie considered and regarded, we would also accoumpt it as a singular mercy of God, and as a speciall favor of you towards us in that behalfe.
In the meane time, I doe in all humility referr the Argumēts, togeather with the defence of them to your graue and iudicious consideration against your next meeting in Parliament: not doub¦ting but that the equitie of the cause, and the innocencie of our selues will therby be so apparant unto you, that though before som perhaps among you, did thinke the one not to be so iust, and the other not so free from all blame, yet when ye shall agayne assemble, ye will all with one mouth as one man, both iustifie the cause, and also speake more then ever before ye haue don, for favor unto vs, and to our people: betwixt whom the bond before made by the Church, and sealed by the holy Ghost in the effects of our Mini∣stery, cannot by any Lordly Episcopall severity be iustly dissolved.
I doe further likewise humblie craue your Honorable lawfull favor more specially towards me (if at any time I shall be disco∣vered) against all those that shall not well brooke the sober and modest taxing of their corruptions in this defence: especially con∣sidering the same is not done of any contentious minde; but onely in loue of the truth, to support it against those that deprave it: and in regard of our owne good names, to mainteyne our owne in¦nocency against those that under the name of brethren, doe most unbrotherly disgrace us.

Moreover, if any thing in this defence following, or in the Arguments themselues, by the malice of any shalbe wrested and perverted, thereby also to wrest and pervert the law to the danger of the severall authors of the one or the other (being found out) may it likewise please you, in all lawfull and righteous manner to put forth your selues for protection of the sayd authors: as chief∣ly because such wresting of words and perverting of iudgment, may procure Gods iudgments against themselues that shall so of∣fend, and against the whole land; so likewise because to speake in such matters and for such persons (whatsoever the answerer saith to the contrary) shall not only bring much peace & comfort to such speakers themselues, but shall also be beneficiall to the whole land, as is shewed in the Arguments, nothing infringed or weakened, by all M. Powels opposition unto them.
Yea let this consideration be a third reason to moue you the ra∣ther so to speake, viz. that if one man had the divinity & know∣ledge in law, as also all other learning, wit and wisdom of all men, yet could he not so warily and circumspectly write in all things, but that some wrangler or other (instructed and set a worke by the serpent, that is more subtle, not onely then all beasts, but also then all men now living on the earth) might and would find some matter or other, wherby to molest and trouble him.
I had thought much more to haue enlarged this my preface, but the prolixity of the defence it selfe much exceeded my first purpos, I will here conclude, both humblie and with all thanks to God & to your selues acknowledging your most religious & gracious endea∣vors at your last Session for the cause and for the persons pleaded for in the argumēts; and most heartily & instantly likewise pray∣ing for you & yours as NehemiahNehem: 5:19: & 13:4: prayed for himselfe: viz. that God in goodnes would remember you (and yours) accor∣ding to all that ye haue doone for vs: and that he will ne∣ver wype out your kindnes that ye haue shewed on the house of your God, and on the officers thereof.
