MY LORD,
THE first Fruits, by the Law of Mo∣ses, were due to God, yet is it no violati∣on now of the Laws of

heaven, in some proporti∣on, to shew our just e∣steem of those who are so much like it here on earth: Hence it is that I presume to Dedicate these my first endeavors of this kind to Your Lord∣ships Patronage and Pro∣tection; and I could wish that the first productions of Art and Study were like those of Nature, that is, the best and most perfect in their kind, that so the Pre∣sent might more resemble it's Patron.
I do not present this to Your Honor, as if you stood in need of Transla∣tions, for in this respect You perhaps are the most improper Person in the Kingdom to make such Dedications to, being Your self so Great a Ma∣ster, not only of the French, but also of the more Ancient and Learn∣ed Languages. But I look upon my self under some obligation of justice, to re∣turn that to Your accep∣tance, which was the re∣sult

of some few hours, which I should have counted stoln from Your Lordships Service, but that such is your Candour and benign Temper, such Your great love and affe∣ction to all commendable Studies, that You and they seem to have the same Ends, and the same Inter∣ests; thus what ever time is employ'd in them, You are pleas'd to look upon it as spent in Your own Ser∣vice.
But this is not all the

right You may justly chal∣lenge to this Translation, Your Title to it seems yet more particular; wherein such was your Favour and Condescension, that, as it would be Ingratitude to conceal, so would it be al∣most Arrogance to ac∣knowledge them; where∣in (pardon the pride of the expression) I had the Honour to be instructed by Your Lordship in the French Tongue; You be∣ing pleas'd, not only to peruse, but in many places

to Correct it, so that I can∣not now so properly chal∣lenge any thing therein my own, as the Imper∣fections.
And now I hope you will pardon this my inno∣cent Ambition, if I desire to publish my Gratitude, and that sense of my Obli∣gations, which is too big to be confin'd in a private breast.
How acceptable this Treatise may be to the World, I know not, yet this I know, that I should

have sufficiently oblig'd the Age, if in the Dedica∣tion I had given it Your Lordship's just Chara∣cter; this being the most probable way to provoke men to the love and imi∣tation of Vertue, not to represent it in Idea and Speculation only, but as it appears both more amiable in it self and more prevalent on others, when thus incorporated in the lives and practices of Noble Persons: But this though a true and

just Relation, would be as uneasie for You to hear, as it would be difficult, yea above the power of my Pen to perform: Thus a∣mong other things, Your own Temper concurs in this, to make You Heroi∣cally Vertuous, that is, a follower of Vertue mere∣ly for Vertues sake, since Your modesty will not en∣dure the common & cheap Reward of a due Praise and just Commendation.
But yet I could wish that I had not so much to

plead for the seasonable∣ness of the Discourse, in an Age where Infidelity on the one hand, & Fanatical Enthusiasm on the other, seem to divide the greater part of the World; where some men look upon all Divine Revelations to be mere Dreams, o∣thers mistake their mere Dreams for Divine Re∣velations: Now what more proper and season∣able in these circumstan∣ces, then that which is the design of this Discourse,

that is, to evidence the Grounds and Reasons why we receive those that are truly Divine, and reject the vain pretences of others?
And to whom could the Dedication be more suit∣able then to one whose Principles and Practices at once confirm and adorn the Religion you profess; whose well-settled judg∣ment, and understanding of Your Religion in ge∣neral, and Your great af∣fection to the Church of

England in particular, render You equally di∣stant from the Superstiti∣on of the Romanists, and the Novelties of later En∣thusiasts?
My Lord, I shall not any further by a tedious address misemploy those precious minutes, which are usually spent either in Your serious and pri∣vate Studies, or in more publick Employments: I shall only beg, that God would long continue You amongst us, and bless

Your endeavours in set∣tling and securing the Kingdom by Your Coun∣sel, and supporting the Church by Your constant Affection; which is the hearty Prayer of
Your Humbly Devoted Servant
