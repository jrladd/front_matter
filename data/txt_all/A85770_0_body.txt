My Lord,
MY Grand-Father RICHARD ADAMS did in his life time think it a principal happiness that he was numbred in the Register of those who had the honour to serve your Lordship; nor did his ser∣vice rest in a naked expression only, but was also practicall; for he was a most af∣fectionate lover and sincere honourer of your Lordship, as being indeed oblig'd unto it, by those many important fa∣vours you continually showr'd upon him. To exhibit to the world some te∣stimony  of my gratefull acknowledge∣ment for those signall engagements; I have by the fourth Impression of this well accepted Treatise of Heraldry, gained an opportunity to insert your Honors Coat, as a pattern of the At∣chievment of a Marquess of ENGLAND, and do devote the whole VVorke to your Lordships Patronage, wherein I hope I shall not in any wise diminish or obscure the lustre of your thrice noble Family, it having been my endeavour and designe, to improve, if it were pos∣sible, the estimate of it; which is still the chiefestaym and onely intention of,
My Lord,
