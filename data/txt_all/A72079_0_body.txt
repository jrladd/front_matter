ANimated by the viewe of your manifolde vertues, (Right Honourable Lady) I haue presumed to shroud this simple worke, vnder the harbor of their protecti∣on, resting in confidence, your Honour will vouch∣safe to accepte the same, though nor for the worthinesse, yet for the well meaning intent of the writer, who in all dutie dedi∣cateth his endeuours, to deserue your Honourable fauour. Trusting your fauourable and prudent cen∣sure, will extinguish the blemish of my ouer-bold∣nesse: and your wisedome, receiue with fauour, what is presented with affection.
Pythias Apollo, refused not to drinke in woodden dishes: Alexander the great and mightie Monarke,
 disdained not to trauell, to visit simple Diogenes in his Cell. Not the gifts value, but the giuers good will, hath bene alwaies esteemed. Euen so I rest in hopefull assurance, that (of your own most Hono∣rable and vertuous inclination to fauour learning) you will daine to take this smal gift, proceeding frō my hartie good will. Which I am bold to present to your protection, thereby in some sort to expresse my humble dutie, which bindeth me to giue your wor∣thinesse a farre better present then this, if my abilitie were correspondent. The dutifull regard I beare to your laudable gifts, beeing such, that I am vnable (hauing no other meane) to expresse the same: hum∣bly beseeching your honour, to accept this gift in place of a better: and my humble and dutifull mea∣ning, in steede of a better performance: And (accor∣ding to your vertuous bountie) vouchsafe to protect this talent of my poore labours, vnder the Title of your honourable Patronage. Which shall bind me to inuocate the almightie, to indue your noblemind with innumerable vertues, increase your honours, inrich you with all blessings, and reward you with eternall happinesse.
