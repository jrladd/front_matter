Friend William Penn,
I Here present Thee with a suc∣cinct (yet compleat) Account of the late. Improvement, and Present State of the Noble Pro∣vince, and Fertile Countrey of Pen∣silvania; with the strange things that have been found there, as the Salamander-Stone, and several others, mentioned in this Treatise; disco∣vered since thou camest out of those Parts. I desire Thee to excuse me for addressing to Thee, such a Plain and Peasant-like Piece; yet however homely or coarse it may appear, Thou wilt find here a true and genuine
 Description of that (once) obscure, tho' (now) glorious Place. So con∣sidering how generous and candid a Man Thou art, I know thou wilt bear with my weak and imperfect Performance, and accept of my good Meaning and kind Intention, which may encourage me, in time to come, to add some more Memoirs to this rough Essay of mine. Being unwilling to tire Thee with any long or tedious Epistle, I take my Leave of Thee,
(Most Noble and Excellent Governor)
