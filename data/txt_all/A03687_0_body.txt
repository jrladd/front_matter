MY honest, humble, harmlesse horning-book,
From whence young Schollers their first learning tool
To you I dedicate (true generous spirit)
Your early towardnesse, and vertues merit
A farre more worthy worke, then here I can
Set out, that ne're was Accademian:
Yet in my homely verse (perhaps) you'l find
Something, a little which may please your mind.
My booke's but Harden to some Holland wit,
And so with home-spun plainest best doth fit;

For in a plaine and honest simple stile,
There lurkes no craft, no subtiltie, nor guile.
Here is no vaine, nor yet prophane discourse,
To make you by the reading be the worse;
I would not staine your thoughts with such a booke,
Nor haue your chaste eyes on such follies looke.
This in a manner doth but plainely show
How Schollers doe begin, and how they grow
To Learning by their industrie and paine,
That rich inestimable Iem to gaine.
(The Horn-book is at first Arts Nurce, frō whence
We suck the milke of our intellîgence)
We must be perfect in our letters all,
E're we to spelling, and to reading fall.
By this Originall, we win (indeed)
The Muses glory, if we so proceede:
And as this booke (sweet Sir) but young appeares
So tis respondent vnto youthfull yeares,
Fit for your young dayes and minoritie,
Vntill you come to senioritie.
Into my mind this cogitation came,
Vnto your selfe to dedicate the same,

Presuming of your fauour, and your loue,
That what I write your vertues will approue
Vpon your face, although your yeares be greene,
The portrature of modestie is seene.
Though in the Teenes you scarce haue enterd yet,
You haue a manly Carriage, pregnant Wit.
God be your good guide, and your happy speede
Euen as you haue begun, so to proceede
In honourable vertues worthy Car,
To make your name shine like the Morning-Star.
Thus Honourable Sir, I take my leaue,
In hope you kindly will (this mite) receiue.
