MY deare Brother, and late compa∣nion in tribulation, you propound your twelve Questions to all sober minded Christians, cordially affecting a speedy setled Reformation, and bro∣therly Christian union in all the Churches, (as you write in Front) and myselfe being one of these, (and no other you shall find me) doe with the right hand take your Propositions as made to me among the rest▪ craving your leave to returne you a brotherly Answer. And brotherly in no∣thing more, then by a candid and Christian deal∣ing with you all along, and that also in a matter of such high moment, as concernes the kingdome and glory of Jesus Christ. The zeale whereof is that alone, which puts me upon this task; it be∣ing otherwise far beyond my thoughts, that you and I, having been fellow-sufferers, and specta∣cles to the world, upon that tragicall stage of An∣tichristian tyranny, should ever come upon the

Theatre as Antagonists, one against the other, about the Kingdome of Jesus Christ. But surely as an Antagonist against you I come not, but in the bowells of a brother. And had not the Book had your name in the Front, my stomack had not stooped so low, as to take it up or downe. But because most men are apt to take all upon trust, where they find Mr. Prinnes name enga∣ged: and the Cause being so precious, as it hath by right taken up my whole heart, to become an Advocate to plead the excellency of it: I could not, though the meanest of all, but for the love of Christ constraining me, and by his grace as∣sisting, undertake this taske. Otherwise unwil∣ling in hoc ulcere esse unguis, as the Roman Ora∣tor said in another case. And this Answer was brought to the birth soone after yours: but it wanted a Midwife, whereof you have plenty. And I have had many interruptions. Nor am I so quick of foot, as you. But I may say, as Ierome once to young Augustin; Bos lassus fortiùs figit pe∣dem. And so in the spirit of love I come to your Booke.
