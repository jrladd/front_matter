SIR,
THE Design of this Dedication is
neither to flatter, nor to beg; but
barely to present you with a sim∣ple
and hearty Acknowledgment of your
Kindness and Generosity to the Publick, in
communicating your exact Memorials, in
advancing the Progress of Useful Know∣ledge,
and encouraging Men of Letters, or
Invention: which Noble Endowments of

Mind render'd you most Worthy of those
High Stations, wherein you have been E∣minent,
as well in the Chair of Philosophy,
as Navigation; and the same will preserve
you through all Ages in the good Esteem
of the best part of Mankind. No Revo∣lution,
no Storm, no Time, can shake
such Foundations.

Monumentum Aere perennius.

Sir,
