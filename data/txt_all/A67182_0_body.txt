GENTLEMEN,
WHen I received the intimation of your de∣sires that I would preach your Guild-Sermon, I was very ready to comply with your request, that I might manifest my willingness to serve you, and own that respect which you were pleased to shew me by making it the unanimous Vote of your Common-Council. But when I was importun'd by you, and those worthy Persons that were present to honour your Solemnity, to Publish what I had Preach'd to you, I was much more unwilling to yield to it, being averse to appear in Print, and loth to be exposed to the Censures of a Critical Age. But I have denied my self that I may not seem to deny you any thing: and in this
 only am ambitious that I may be able to gratifie so honest and Loyal a Corporation.
The solemnity of a Guild-Merchant is peculiar to your Town, and (I think) no where else observed in England, at least not with that Formality and Gran∣deur, and with that respect and free Entertainment gi∣ven to those Persons of Quality and Gentry that from all parts flock to see it, and are wellcomed with the hono∣rary Freedom of your Corporation.
It seems strange that so ancient and laudable a Custom should be singular: and if an account of your decent and regular management of it were made publick, I doubt not but it would invite other places to follow your example.
But as this is your peculiar Priviledg, so I reckon it your great happiness that you live like a Fraternity, and are not more careful of your own Franchises, than con∣formable to the Laws, such especially as are made to pre∣serve Society by preventing Dissension and Division: and you may justly glory in this, that for sundry years last past, no Separate Meeting, or Seditious Conventi∣cle has disturbed the Peace of your Corporation, or divided you into Parties and Factions, but you have lived as Brethren in Peace and Unity, and worshipped God with Order and Uniformity.
I heartily wish it may always be the honor of your Corporation, to be famous for Agreement and Uni∣ty: and have endeavoured all I could to endear it in the
 ensuing Discourse: which if it may any way contribute to so good an effect, I have my design, and let God have the Glory. I am sure the meaning was honest, to persuade to Love and Peace, and promote Union and Agreement, and will hope it may be serviceable to that end, since you were pleased to think it so. I know not what entertainment it may find amongst those that read it: but I cannot wish for a more kind reception than it had from them that heard it: what ever others judg of it, it challenges a favourable Construction from you whose Importunity made it Publick; and thereby have given me an Opportunity to tell the World, how much I am,
