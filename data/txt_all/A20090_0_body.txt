HONOR (this day) takes you by the Hand,
and giues you welcomes into your New-Office
of Pretorship. A Dignity worthie
the Cities bestowing, and most worthy your
Receiuing. You haue it with the Harts of ma∣ny
people, Voices and Held-vp hands: they know it is a
Roabe fit for you, and therefore haue clothed you in it. May
the Last-day of your wearing the same, yeeld to your Selfe as
much Ioy, as to Others does this First-day of your putting
it on. I swimme (for my owne part) not onely in the Maine
Full sea of the General praise and Hopes of you. But powre
out also (for my particular) such a streame as my Prayers
can render, for a successe answerable to the On-set: for it is
no Field, vnlesse it be Crowned with victory.
I present (Sir) vnto you, these labours of my Pen, as the
first and newest Congratulatory Offrings tendred into
your hands, which albeit I should not (of my selfe) deserue to
see accepted, I know notwithstanding you will giue to them
a generous and gratefull entertainement, in regard of that
Noble Fellowship and Society, (of which you Yesterday

were a Brother, and This Day a Father) who most freely
haue bestowed these their Loues vpon you. The Colours
of this Peece are mine owne; the Cost theirs: to which no∣thing
was wanting, that could be had, and euery thing had
that was required. To their Lasting memory I set downe
This; And to your Noble Disposition, this I Dedicate.
My wishes being (as euer they haue bene) to meete with a∣ny
Obiect, whose reflexion may present to your Eyes, that
Loue and Duty,
