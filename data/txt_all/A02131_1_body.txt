PRaxiteles the Painter, being de∣maunded why in presenting a curious target to Minerua hee did most cunnigly pourtray the picture of her Priest Chrisites, aunswered that Mynerua was wise, & so was Chrisites, & that being his friend he thought this the best meanes to gratifie him. Which saying of Praxiteles I take as a sufficient excuse for my rashnesse. For if I be demaunded why in dedicating my Booke to others I haue inserted your worshippes name, I answere that both your constant, vertuous and godly dispo∣sitiō caused me with Praxiteles to ingraue your name in a worke where Gentlewomens cōstan∣cie is so stifly defended, knowing your rare and vertuous qualities to be such, as your verie ene∣mies (if you haue anie) shall be forced maugre their face to extoll vour fame with immortall
 praise, and also your liberall bountie & friendly curtesie (whereof without any desert I haue ta∣sted) draue me, though not as I would, yet as I could, to shew the dutifull affection wherwith I am bound to be at your commaund for euer. While thus I wished more euidently to shewe some signe of my good will, a certaine letter of Mamillia to the yong Ladie Modesta chaunced to come vnto my hands, wherein the Anatomy of Louers flatteries is displaied, which I humbly present vnto your worshipfull patronage, desi∣ring you to accept it, not according to the value of the gift, but to the mind of the giuer, and as∣suring you that none of your welwillers do in heart wish you more prosperitie, though my a∣bilitie be not able in outward shewe to make it manifest. Thus ceasing to trouble your wor∣ship, I commit you to the Almightie.
