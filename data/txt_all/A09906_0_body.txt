RIght Noble Lord, my resolue was aduised, to make immoration vpon the nicest circumstances of your pre∣sent hauiour, in plentifull and hono∣rable sorrow, whose animall motion might bee admou'd to the violence hereof: This gaue leaue to the greater obseruance which wee owe to the deceased, (that is) in protection and contesta∣tion: Besides that warrant of the antentique & Censoriall rites, whose example I haue here quo∣ted for most Honorable Heraldrie, in disposing her funerall torch by due reference, into your suruiuing hand; neither infeebling the courtesie
of the liuing▪ nor promising mine owne aduan∣tage vpon your Noble and innated goodnesse, nei∣ther to actuate, & reficate molestias, but in mine owne affectation to be conformed with that Romane solemnity of dedication,

And as she was, I write for president,
More of succession, than griefs argument.
