HEroicke Hamlton, FRANCK to thee affoordeth,
With heartlie Love the praise of IAMES his worth
Our King defunct, and since my soule concordeth
With CHARLES his vertuous valoure, I send forth
My hearts desire in prayer to my God,
That hee our Soveraigne CHARLES may still defend
In Christs Religion: so that his abode,
May in beginning, in the midst, and end
Bee alwayes, and for ever with our Lord,
And Saviour ioynd, by holy inspiration
Of Gods good spirit, so that hee not debord,
From the right way, which hath to Heaven relation:
But that in him his grace aboundantlie,
With the right vse, and incresse hee supplie.
