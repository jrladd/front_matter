AMidst the great deprava∣tion
of Morality, where∣with
the present Age is
chargeable, it is some comfort, that
there is a certain improvement
of Gratitude, of which there are,
at least, so many Demonstrati∣ons,
as we find Dedicatories.
You have many times very sea∣sonably

surpriz'd me with your
Kindnesses, and this is the first
Opportunity I have had, to make a
Publick Acknowledgment thereof.
In the primitive fervour of Chri∣stian
Discipline, men were con∣tent
to undergo publick penances,
in order to the expiation of secret
miscarriages. Why therefore may
not a private act of Generosity
lay an obligation upon the Recei∣ver,
to make an open celebration
thereof, if there be a concurrence
and combination of circumstances
to enforce it?
The former productions of this
Comical and Burlesque Author,
of my publishing in English, that

is to say, his Novels, were ad∣dress'd
to the Patronage of the
worthily - worshipful▪ Thomas
Stanley, Esquire, and I am ve∣ry
apt to attribute the kind re∣ception
they met withal in the
World to the sacredness of that
Dedication. The present Colle∣ction
of Letters is the close of
all that is to be expected of his
in Prose: And 'tis my presump∣tion,
that, being recommended to
the publick, under a name so
neerly related to him, they will
meet with a success answerable
to that of the others.
But whatever entertainment
they may have, I make this ad∣vantage,

of this publication, that
I have made a Manifesto of my
respects, where I am so much en∣gag'd
to do it, and consequently,
how much I am,
Honoured Sir,
