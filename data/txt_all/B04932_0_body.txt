SIR,
I  Holy War against those arbarous and Blasphemous Infidels, your (now both in Heaven and Earth) most glorious Brother, hath had the honour to Sacrifice his Life; There was indeed, n fairer way, to engrave the Glory of your Fame, and Family in the Immortall Annals of all ensuing Ages. I doubt not but his Death wi shortly be the sad Joyfull-theam of a more skilfull, and accomplisht Pen▪ The cruel and fretting afflictions I have unfortunatly encountered, (whic I hope shall prove all but ed-ea to my Cana, to which Age now hast me) have so li  a my senses, that am like one gone along journey from himself, where the excess of Sorro fearce gives way to the relief of Words; The evident tokens whereof, a that formerly knew me, will quickly perceive, in the following Poem Being, alas! wholly destitute of the delicaces of an acut Invention, and th politness of a transporting expression; but what is sometimes a mans Fa is not always his Fault, as by a dear bought Experience, I have too mu learned now to know. I am not altogether of his mind that lately w the Life of the Grand Vizier Cara Mustapha, that it was only an amo¦ous pique that hath rumbled the World, into these Grand Transactions to me they carry the ting and tincture of an higher Source; And thou that now all Caresses and Liberalities to the uses be banished this part of  World, yet could I have the happiness to animat any to that degree of Z to avenge the Injury and Quarrel of our blasphemed Saviour, I doubt  but my now naked Muse would quickly grow Pen-feathered, and learn to s with such a touring Wing, as would render thm the celebrated Models Religion, Virtue, and Honour. I have fo born, in this Address to h expatiated on your own Person  nd Gallantry, lest it should s an attack upon your modesty:  Winter-day, I shall make ame for my unpleasantness by my b  en I have only told you so g an esteem I have for your  at unto what extremity of adv Fortun, I am so ever reduce  always preserve the profound ¦spect and Passion of
