SIR,
WHere I stand engaged in a Just Service, and would Publish it; I less fear the censure of Vain-Glory then of Ingratitude. I know the Age is very severe in her Pa∣raphrase on those who appear for Truth, when as others pass uncensured; Yet I am resolved rather to hazard the impu∣tation of a Weak-man, then to be ac∣counted one Unthankful. He that doth but Tacitely acknowledge the Fa∣vours of a Noble Friend doth in a manner Bury them; when as he that
 Proclaims them, hath in a part requi∣ted; he hath repaid His Honour, and therefore Him, and so hath satisfied, though not restored. I desire not so much to expose my Labours to the World, as to express my acknowledgements of your Worth and Goodness. The Ancient of Days multiply your Days here upon Earth, and at last take you to that place where there shall be no Night: So Praying, rests,
