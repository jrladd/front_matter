SIR if the remem∣brance of former be∣nefits can moue or bounty in more am∣ple sorte extended can prevaile, I haue reason both to ag∣nise your loue shew∣ed, and your bounty showred towards me; least worthy of such immerited affections. Yet because vnthankfulnesse stops the cur∣rent of Gods blessings, and makes vs dege∣nerate from that we should be, I resolved with my selfe to gratifie your loue (at least in some sort) by acknowledging that entire
