IT is (right Wor∣shipfull) the com∣mon
condition of
all Christians,
howsoeuer disioyned in place,
that they are militant in
one warfare against Sathan
with his Principalities, Pow∣ers
and spirituall wicked∣nesse,
whose stratagems are

innumerable, and the man∣ner
of his assaults manifold:
he troubleth not all Gods chil∣dren
one manner of way; for
so euery one might easily espie
wherein his strength lyeth,
but makes choise of the temp∣tation,
as by long experience
he hath learned it may bee
most effectuall to worke vpon
our naturall disposition. Like
as on the other hand, the
Grace by which God streng∣theneth
his Children to resist
him, is much more manifold;
whereby they are instructed
to vse the Armour of God,
with such variety of heauen∣ly
wisedome, that is a won∣der
to see, how by one and

the selfesame sentēce of Gods
word, at sundry hands, sun∣dry
manner of wayes, Sa∣than
is confounded: & there∣fore
it is very needfull that
in the spirituall warfare
there should be a mutuall in∣telligence
among the Souldi∣ers
of Christ, as well for dis∣couering
of Sathans seuerall
sleights in assaulting; for the
more his policie is detected,
the better may we eschew it;
as also, for the manifestation
of GODS rich mercy in
assisting.
For this cause haue I been
induced to communicate vn∣to
others, these Meditations,
as it pleased God by experi∣ence,

to communicate them
vnto me, for in the middest
of darknesse which couered
the mind, and restlesse feare
which disquieted the consci∣ence,
the Lord made them so∣dainely
to breake out, like
sparkles of light, sent from
his owne Throne of Grace,
bringing with them light,
peace, and ioy, which in a mo∣ment
remoued the former
feares, and pacified the per∣turbations
of my troubled
soule. As they were vnto me,
so I wish they may be meanes
of comfort vnto others: but
I know that the same argu∣ment
of comfort, which hath
comforted one in temptati∣ons,

doth not alwaies comfort
another: Nay, not in the selfe∣same
temptation; for the
Lord will haue his praise re∣serued
to himselfe, that hee
onely is the God of al comfort.
It is not the word, (saith
Dauid) but God by the word
that did quicken him, Psal.
119. 9. Yea, the most comfor∣table
promise of the Gospell is
most terrible to the troubled
conscience, except the Lord
by it worke in the heart a
sence of his mercy: and there∣fore
such as want comfort,
let thē seeke it from the God
of comfort. Neuerthelesse,
that which we haue, we giue
euen as we haue receiued it;

that it may stand as a me∣moriall
of my thankfulnes to
God who shewed his great
mercy vpon me, when with∣in
my selfe I had receiued the
sentence of death; and a testi∣monie
of my loue toward
them who are militant a∣gainst
Sathan: And specially
of that Christian remem∣brance
I haue alway of you
in the Lord Iesus; to whose
grace I commend you, now,
and for euer.
