THrice Noble Lady, spare that melting Bead,
Our sorrows want no jewel from your head;
Still let those silver drops, that lightly lye
Like little delug'd worlds within your eye;
Fixed abide in their own brightest sphear,
His fame wants not those pendents for her ear;
Those falling stars rob heaven, we need not thence
Borrow our griefs, or taxe you with expence:
Behold how every Mourner brings his sheet
To wipe your eyes, and weep himself; 'tis meet
That this so publick loss by th' Countries charge
Should mourned be: Spare, Madam, then: this large
And thicker Volume that is here annext,
Is but our Comment on that publick text:
Come Argus, Hieraclicus, lend your eyes
To pay on's tomb a liquid sacrifice;
Lo all the grasse that round about him lye,
Hangs full of tears shed from Dame Natures eye,
See how sad Philomele (that yonder sits,
And to the dancing twig her musick fits)

Now mourns for him, the silver brook runs on,
Grumbling to leave those loved banks, whereon
A Mansion once he had; that's now set round
With Cypress trees, and with their branches crown'd;
So dark, it seems Nights mantle for to borrow,
And may be cal'd, the gloomy den of sorrow.
E're since he di'd; the Heavens their griefs to tell,
Daily in tears to earth's wet bosome fell;
Not in an April storm, or those in June,
Whose trembling Cadents makes it rain in tune;
But like a grave Decembers day, or those
Who mourn in Cicero's stile, and weep in prose.
Madam, you see all Natures wat'ry store
Attends this sable day, weep you no more;
Angels, that on your eyes with bottles wait
To catch your falling tears, do now retreat
With vessels full; anon again they'l stoop,
And lightly hover round the mourning troop,
Whilst I in silence do his Shrine adore;
If worship doth offend, I then implore,
And crave a favour, Madam, 'tis this one,
Adde to his memory no pictur'd stone;
Lest whilst within the Church my vows I pay,
I to the Image of this Saint should pray.
Madam,
