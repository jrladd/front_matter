SIR,
THe daily and nume∣rous Increase of the Heretical Genera∣tion of Quakers in these Parts made me a little more than ordinarily inquisitive into their Doctrins and Per∣suasions, which I found not only destructive of all Civil Po∣litie and Government, but of Religion itself and the Worship of

Almighty God established amongst us: For what else can be expected from them who deny the Scripture to be the Word of God, and our Rule and Guide in matters of Sal∣vation? And they being so well known to you, as having had frequent Experience of their ob∣stinate and perverse Humor, in the Discharge and Execution of those Trusts and Employments committed to you under His most Sacred Majesty, I could do no less than present you with this small Treatise, that going under the Name and Protection of so worthy and accomplisht a Person as your self, it may in some mea∣sure obtein its desired Effect, by

putting a stop to the growing E∣vil, and confirming those who are not yet seduced in the Truth of their Profession; and may te∣stifie to the World, how much I am
Honoured Sir,
