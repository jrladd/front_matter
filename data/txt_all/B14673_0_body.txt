RIght worshipfull, since GOD made the two great lights, the one to rule the day, the other the night, there were neuer so many good meanes to encrease knowledge and godlinesse, as there are at this day, neuer a time when it was more requisite that we should carefully vse these means thē now, neuer anything more profitable then the right vse of them. If we did duely consider the corruption of our owne nature, the snares of this present world, the slip∣perinesse of worldly prosperitie, the shortnesse of our liues, and the certainety of the Iudgement to come, wee would employ all our studies and la∣bours
about that one thing which is most needful,
o. 42 that we might so passe our time while we remaine in this vale of misery, that after our departure hence, we may liue in eternall felicitie. To this end only haue I caused this Sermon now at length to be published to the viewe of the world, from which aduenture many things haue stayed mee almost these three years, but chiefely these two, mine own immaturitie and the plainenesse or ra∣ther the rudenes of the stile & phrase of speach. Neuerthelesse sith we be all debters one to ano∣ther, and the heathen men teach vs this lesson, that we are not born for our selues, but our friends chalenge a part, our parents a part, our coūtrey a part, laying aside feare, I haue at this time em∣boldened my selfe with the poore widow to cast a slender offering into the Lords treasurie. This mine endeauour  present vnto your worship, in rememberance of that Christian fauour which you haue shewed vnto me. Thus I commend you & all yours to the father of lights, that is able to enrich you in this life with the treasure of know∣ledge & wisdom, and in the life to come to blesse you with immortalitie in the ioyfull place of rest for euer and euer.
