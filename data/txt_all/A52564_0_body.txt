My LORD,
THe World hath such a Ve∣neration for your Lord∣ship, that but to affix your Name here, gives an en∣noblement to what of its self is alto∣gether immeriting. I do not a lit∣tle glory in the honour of your Friendship, and that in the perusal of these Papers you have been pleased to give them a valuation. I do now with more than ordinary assurance let them see light, since influenced by your favour, and warranted by so true an understanding.
My Lord, Divinity is not my Pro∣vince,
and in a dissolte age may seem less fashionable: but the most unconcerned person, when he comes to make a retreat into himself, will leave to turn devotion into Ridicule, and find piety his best security. Heights of this nature are not within my Ta∣lent; what I have most, reached at hath been the gracefulness of expres∣sion, otherwise unfit to approach your Lordship. I know no reason but that composures of this kind should put on all the lustre we can dress them with, to beget Inamoratos, since their in∣trinsick beauty hath in this pore-blind world so little attraction.
My Lord, 'tis usual in Dedications to celebrate the persons we address to; but your Lorship hath so often drawn your self to the life, that a rude Pen∣cil would seem but to disfigure the fair Lineaments your inimitable hand hath fashioned. To enumerate your Lordships perfections were too
bold an undertaking, and (where they are so eminently known) were to set up a Taper to the Meridian Sun. Besides (but by paying your Lordship a fitting observance) I should offend your hu∣mility, of which you are a great example. Though the Copy seldom reaches the original, yet that all per∣sons would endeavour such perfection, is heartily wished by him, that desires to continue the honour of stiling him∣self,
My Lord,
