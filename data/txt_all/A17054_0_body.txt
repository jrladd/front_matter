SAint Hierome com∣plained of the mul∣titude and abuse of writers in his time. Salomon to shew the vanity of mē in wri∣ting of bookes, be∣ginneth one of his bookes with Vanitie. Vanitie of vanities (saith Salomon the Preacher) vanitie of vanities, and all is but vanitie: and as he beginneth his booke so he endeth it, as if from the beginning vnto the ending, here were nothing but vanity in all o∣ther

bookes, the holy Scripture onely excepted, no part or parcell whereof may be guilty of the least thought of va∣nitie in the world; the holy Ghost being in the holy scripture as the soule is in the bodie, all in all, and all in euery part. And therefore in the later ende of his booke to leade vs vnto the beginning of true wisedome, he pricketh men forward and exhorteth them to the diligent reading of Gods words, the words of truth, by comparing them vnto prickes and nailes fastned by the masters of the assemblies. To auoyd Saint Hieromes complaint, & follow Salomons godly exhortation, the Author of this present treatise vpon the Canticles, did exercise him self from his infancie in the studie of Gods word, the which he read so earnestly and eagerly, as if (as Saint Austin saith) he could ne∣uer haue read it sufficiently, though h should haue begun neuer so soone, and liued neuer so long. But finding the scrip¦tures by his owne experience so written in diuerse places (though all Scripture be written for our instruction) as if i

were not written, as it was sayd of cer∣taine bookes of Aristotle: in so much that when the Eunuch readeth, Philip had need to stand by & interpret. He thought it good, for the good of the Church and glorie of God, to bestow the greatest part of his time, partly in translating the Bible into his mother tongue (which he did most exactly) partly in writing such a commentarie vpon the Bible, as might in doubtfull and hard places fully satisfie and content the minde of the religious reader. Now there are many which haue written vpon the Bible learned and godly commentaries in all tongues & langua∣ges, many more now (thanks be to God) in these later dayes, thē in former times: but of all late writers, there is none (for any that I haue seene or heard) which may be compared with this Brucioli, for absolute and exquisite knowledge in the tongues, great reading in the Fathers, shortnesse and plainnesse in deliuering of the meaning of the holy Ghost, and last of all such soundnesse in Religion, & integritie of doctrine, as may seeme ad∣mirable

in any man, but in Brucioli and Italian, wonderfull beyond the degree of admiratiō. For surely as it seemed strāge vnto the Iewes, that out of Galile should come any good: so it is no lesse stranges vnto some, that Italie should affoord vs any good; Italy being the cage of vn∣cleannesse, and seate of Antichrist. But God, the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Iewes, the God of Italians as of Englishmen, no accepter of persons, or respecter of place, hath euen in Italie many (peraduenture thousands) which haue not bowed their knees vnto Baal, e∣lecting some out of each nation & coun∣trey, to make vp the summe of his elect. Now as God in his mercie hath stirred vp some to defende his glorie in other countreys, so hath he raised vp this Bru∣cioli to be a principall setter forth of his glorie in Italie, which that man of sinne the Romane Antichrist perceiuing, hath therefore laboured to suppresse and abo∣lish his painfull labours: but man purpo∣seth and God disposeth. For as they haue bene forbidden twise, so twise haue they

bene printed, and that in no other place then Venice, dedicated to men of the contrary religion, which (it should seem) he professed, and submitted to the cen∣sure of our holy mother the Church: pro∣uided that out of the Scriptures and Fa∣thers they should be able to refute his doctrine, which out of thē both he had most learnedly cōpiled. The time wherin he liued I find not certainly set downe of any: but this is most certaine, that he li∣ued about the time of Conradus Pellica∣nus, some 70 or 80 yeares ago, and that Pellican did verie much profite him∣selfe by Brucioli, or Brucioli by Pellicans writings: which is the more probable, by how much the more Brucioli hath in his Cōmentary, besides that which is out of Pellican translated into his books word for word in diuerse places. The order & method which he obserued in his Com∣mentarie is such as deserueth to be imi∣tated of all men that labour in this busi∣nesse, in easie and facill places of the Bi∣ble, either to be altogether silent, or very short and briefe: in harder places to be

more plentifull and copious, in no place spending paper and inke in idle and vn∣profitable questions, such as tend not to edification. As to dispute the case in this Commentarie vpon the Canticles, whe∣ther of the three bookes which Salomon wrote, he wrote the Canticles in the first or second place, as the Iewes ima∣gine, or last of all, as all the Latine wri∣ters do consent. Whether there be more persons then foure, or whether this book be meant literally of Pharaohs daughter, or mystically of the Church: these que∣stions being farre aboue the reach of the commō sort of people, he omitteth pur∣posely. And because all writers with one voyce consent that the Church is meant by the Spouse, he so taketh it without a∣ny further adoe, instructing vs in these points of religion, necessary to be taught of him and vnderstood of vs. That the Church here militant consisteth of two parts, a visible and an inuisible: that in the Church Christ must beare rule, and not Peter; that Gods word must be heard, and not mens traditions: finally he tea∣cheth

vs the necessitie of faith, and fruite of good workes: these are the principall points which he handleth in this booke, euery where ioyning with them matter of comfort and exhortation: and thus much for Brucioli and his Commentary. Now for my selfe and my translation, I could haue wished that others which haue the gift of interpretation, wold haue taken the worke in hand, but seeing they haue bene slacke in this businesse, I haue for that exceeding great loue which I beare vnto t workes of this learned man, a stranger, but not from the faith, translated this booke of the Canti∣cles, with that minde which he wrote it, to the glorie of God and benefite of his Church. In translating of it I haue not yeelded word for word, but sence for sence, and sentence for sentence. For the text I haue not followed mine Authour, but taken the authorized translation in our English Bibles, for that it is a matter of great difficultie, and not for a young man to translate: and is besides war∣ranted by Fulke against the Papists, and

learned Maister Hooker against our ad∣uersaries at home; only I haue noted the differences which are not many, either by the side of the booke, or in the text of the Commentarie. This small labour of mine, I am bold to present vnto your Lordship (right Honorable.) Others for other respectes, out of the treasures of their wits and industries, haue presented you with greater volumes: my self being young in yeares and poore in wit, do of∣fer vp into your hands, all that I haue as yet prouided, which is at the most but a poore Orphans mite. Which I do in this respect onely; for that honorable regard which your Lordship hath of learning & religiō, which are the loadstones to draw the hearts of men vnto you. For which cause my self being as yet vnknowne vn∣to your Lordship, am moued to sue vnto the same for protection; for protection for my selfe, and defence for mine Au∣thor, a meere stranger; the title of your office and vertuous disposition to others doth promise vs great comfort. For see∣ing God hath made you a Keeper, and

that as it is here in the Canticles, of ma∣ny vines, and that you haue kept your vines so, that of the frute thereof hath bene made wine right comfortable vnto many drooping hearts in this land, what remaineth there in me, but to be confi∣dent in your Honors kind acceptance of this booke, and to beseech God the true keeper of Israel, which neither slumbreth nor sleepeth, long to preserue your Ho∣nour in health, to the maintenance of learning and religion, the preseruation of her Maiestie, and vniuersall good of this land.
