SIR, Considering with my selfe the over-flowing fancies of these daies, the desire beeing growne common vnto each man almost, to see himselfe in Print (wherein is observable much vanity vnder the Sunne) it was not my purpose from the beginning, to make pub∣like, further then by publishing with open voyce, these my poore indigested labours: and if by adventuring into the light, I be equally censured to fall vnder the same taxation which I have laide vpon the times, it would proove but an addition to my vaine attempts to lay the imputation vpon other mens perswasions.
Thus far notwithstanding in this last particular, I must not dissemble; that reading the counsell of a faithfull friend, who hath iudiciously censured the Diseases of the time, and in the first place doth note such who love to write every thing, and such who affect to write nothing, thing, I inclined to his reasons, and then overcome well-nigh
with a selfe conceit and loue of my owne inventi∣ons, I began to perswade with my selfe, that the pur∣pose halfe-conceived, might bee produced really into effect.
This one thing in serious wise, yet faintingly vnder the silent langvage of my pen, I doe pronounce, how full of Interiections, the studie of this Theme was which Sermon-wise I have vnfolded: so why may I not againe without suspicion of selfe flattery presume, that in the same, I have not travelled altogether in vaine? but as I discovered some sparkle of new light to the setling of the peace of my owne soule, so I trust the perusall hereof shall not proove vngratefull to others, who study after pati∣ence, and to please the Lord with vprightnesse in the land of the living.
Why with you Sir, rather then others, I have desired to leave this simple gage of my hearty regard and sincere affection, I must confesse, that friendly vsage and kinde respect continued since the time you first had sight of mee beyond my merit, and the ordinary vse to strangers, hath made me not only hold in reverence your liberall dispositi∣on this way; but also to advance my thoughts higher in a speciall regard vnto Divine providence, with patience to expect the issue in this and other occurrents, whereof vnto my promised content in private, I have made par∣ticular application, and vnder this name doe crave par∣don for my boldnesse if I have erred.
When Rachel had borne Naphtali, shee expressed the travell of her soule, by the name shee bestowed vpon the fruit of her body; shee had wrastled with much paine in her inward desires before she could bring forth, therefore she gave the childes name from wrastling, she called him Naphtali. Iacob wrastled with God and prevailed; and
thence is the name bestowed vpon all Gods Elect; he is no childe of Israel that is no wrastler.
Whither it be with our flesh and blood, or in an higher kinde, with Principalities and Powers, or in the highest degree with God himselfe, with teares and prayers and strong cries, and other whiles with pangs and terrors, with griefe, with anger, anguish, and bitternesse of spirit, we must all that looke for the blessing wrastle the wrast∣lings of God.
Thus Abraham wrastled a long time before he obtai∣ned Isaac; Isaac wrastled twentie yeeres before he obtai∣ned Iacob, and Iacob by his wrastling got the name of Israel: Rachel was a woman-wrastler when she brought forth Naphtali, an example to instruct her weaker Sexe in the like trade of wrastling, and Hanna did sustaine a long and grievous wrastling; yet in the end shee had pow∣er with God, and brought forth Samuel.
Lastly, Ionah was a wrastler, and so am I: Further to expresse which, then to the common Reader I doe for∣beare, for whose sake chiefely, I have enlarged those Me∣ditations, which were vttered lately in a great assembly, have collected them into one forme, and doe now make humble offer of them to your gentle intertainment. The which kinde of testimonie of my sincere meaning and du∣tious loue professed to you, I have rather made choice of, then as the vsuall manner now adaies is, to prefixe a large Encomium of titles, honours, words of Worship and of Worth, termes of the highest elevation, and straines of the lowest and most prostrate submission, with many other superlative peerelesse, comparisons, and farre fetcht com∣mendations, and to place it in the front of their writings in a forme Dedicatory, to give lustre to all the pages fol∣lowing,
whether to the Lords or Ladies, Patrones or Pa∣tronesses.
Which kinde of writing, as it was never practised by mee, so Sir I hope, you doe presume, the same not to bee affected by you; whose retired integritie and vnshaken constancy, in the strictest course of mortification doth well witnesse, that you more respect the praises of God then of men. For which cause I have the more heartily desired an increase of your good opinion towards mee, and an happy confirmation of that bond of mutuall good liking, whereof I have seene some faire beginnings.
Accept Sir then of this my kindnesse, the fruits of a ready minde, the pledge of my love and true observance only as it respecteth you; a testification of my good will to Sion, and the building vp vnto further holinesse, as it re∣sptcteth others not yet growne, but groaning vnder their imperfections; a fruit of my inward labours & strivings, my Naphtali, my Benoni, pained as I was in the con∣ception, grieved in the production, & after, as respectēth my selfe and halting yet hopefull indeavours in the vine∣yard of his Church. And so I commend it and my selfe once more to your friendly acceptance, and your counsels, wishes, and whole selfe to his happie guydance, who is God of all true comfort and consolation to his chosen Israel, and rest,
