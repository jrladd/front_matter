Gentlemen,
THis which I present you with at present, is not to inform you, but to invite you to second me, and in that to better me upon this deser∣ving Theme Had I either Talents or Time to have wrought this up to a Book, which is but now an A.B.C.
 I had not wanted worthy men to have been bold with to have stood for my Wit∣nesses; more especially that Gentleman who hath really enabled the Masters of Ana∣tomy in particular (as well as the Company in general) to go through not onely the Charge (a great Encourage∣ment now a days) but the Dissection it self, by pro∣viding an able Physician, whose Science might give life to our Art, and whose Tongue might direct our Hand, that so the Learner might at once both know what was Dissected, and see how it was done: And truly,
 had our Company many of the same temper, we might soon be Lenders, that have been so long Borrowers, and be Judges our selves of Truth and Error in this My∣stery. Next to him, the two old Masters equally deserve, as having first entred this Labyrinth, and managed their Clew of Directions for the extricating themselves there, where so many have been lost; But I must not be bold to have such great Gos∣sips to so mean a Brat,
—Mihi curta Supellex. If any of those many a∣mong you, who (as Eras∣mus saith of our English∣men)
 are Ingeniosi, utinam & laboriosi, will mend me by doing more, I shall com∣mend my self for doing this little to provoke you to so good a work: When any of your Suns shall arise, my little Star shall pull in his head; till then, if it give any light at all, I have my aym. Farewel.
