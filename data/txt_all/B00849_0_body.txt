SIr,
being not long agone in a friends house of mine, he shewed me an old Booke of Parchment, in a writ∣ten
 hand, entreating of sundry matters, and in sundry languages: The which, when I had ope∣ned it, I fell (by chaunce) vppon a little Treatise of Husbandrye and plough∣ing, written in old French, so ill set together, and so straungely painted, that I had much a doo before I could reape any thing of it: but finally, it was gods will (after I had long mu∣sed vpon it) to shewe vn∣to mee the meaning of the same: And finding it a worke right worthie to be
 put in the handes of the publike, (because it entrea∣teth of publike affaires) I thought good, yea most reasonable, to commit it first into your lerned hāds, to the ende that vnder the protection of your authori∣tie, it might walke in grea∣ter safetie. Therefore, I beseech your Honour most humbly, to receiue it accep∣tably, & to looke on it with so bountifull an eye, that it may be the bolder to shew it selfe: not only in English through all this Realme, but also in other langua∣ges
 throughout all inhabi∣ted countries: and so, your Honour shall graft within me a most entire, and most pure affection to praie vn∣to God (as yet at this time I do pray) to grant you (in health, and long time) an encrease of all Honorable estates, with true & eternal felicitie.
