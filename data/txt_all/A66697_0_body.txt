Gentlemen,
THe famous Acts of your noble Pro∣genitors
hath awakened my Pen
to set them forth, though not in so full
manner as they do deserve: What person
skill'd in History that can be ignorant of
the Worthy exploits of Sir John Hawk∣wood,
whose honour'd praise sounds tho∣row
the Territories of all Christendom, and

whose heroick acts hath by Fames Trum∣pet
been sounded forth to the utmost parts
of the earth. This Honoured person with
several other magnanimous Hero's being
of the Worthy Merchant-Taylors Trade,
I thought a History of them would not be
unwelcome to you, considering things of
this Nature have been well entertained by
those of other Trades inferior to you. The
Book of the Gentle Craft hath had a gene∣ral
acceptance of the Cordwainers, and the
History of the Six Worthy Yeomen of the
West, and Jack of Newley the like from
the Weavers. Daign therefore to accept
of this, and the good will of him that wrot
it, who is a Lover of your Society, ambiti∣ous
of the encrease of your honour, and
one that subscribes himself
