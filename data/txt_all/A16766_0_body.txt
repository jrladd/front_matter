THE much good that I know in you,
and the good that in your goodnesse
I haue receiued from you, makes me
willing to remember you, with this
small token of greater seruice that I
owe you: wherein, though there be
nothing worthy the accepting; yet
vpon good consideration, it may be
you shall finde some thing, almost worthy the reading. The
humors in it are variable, but the intent aymeth at one
marke; which is, the Nature of the best minde: In which, as
neare as I can, I haue played the merry Verser, I dare not
say, the Poet. But as it is; let me intreate you, in your kind∣nesse
to accept it, in your good thoughts to grace it, at your
idle leysure to reade it, and in no wise to commende it:

but, to remooue a Melancholie, to looke vpon its; and when
you haue done, to laugh at it: So, in thankes for your vnde∣serued
good fauours, leauing my Verses to your good patience,
and my better Vertues to your commaundement, I rest.
