SIR,
I Presume to invite you to these sa∣cred Nuptials: the Epithalamium sung by a crowned Muse. Never was there Paire of so divine a Beautie, nor united in such harmonious Affecti∣ons: and infinitely he deserved her love; redeemed at so dear a Price, and inricht with so invaluable a Dowry.
SIR, Let me finde your Pardon for thus long continuing to make my Allay currant by the impression of your Name. Directed by your pro∣pitious Aspect, have I safely steered between so many Rocks; and now, arrived at my last Harbor, have bro∣ken up my ruinous Vessell.
