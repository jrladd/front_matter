AS all Eyes gaze vpon the Sunne (most excellent Prince) the Treasurer of Light and Time: so for the most part all thoughts leuell at the bestower of dig∣nities and rewards, the Prince, who resembles the Sunne in his spheare. And though it be true that to me (the least and most vnfortunate of all men, wrapt vp through infinite calamities in a Cimmerian night of vnknowne obscuritie) whe∣ther I consider the humblenesse of my Muse, or Fortunes, it may seeme sufficient, to obtaine by reflexion euen the least heate and light from the smallest starre in your Horizon. Yet hauing o particular respect, nor influence from any of hese, being indifferently a stranger to all, and herefore fearing a wrong starre, like a bad Sea∣man,

ignorant (saue by vncertaine relation) both of their aspects and effects, their diuers motions propper, fort, &c. Ignorant of all planetarie re∣uolutions and eccentricities: and, in this Age of doubtfulnesse, where the most certaine things are most subiect to question, seeing least reason (with Copernicus) to beleeue, that which striues most to enfoce the sense. I resolued vpon a sud∣den boldnesse to looke vp to your Princely light, constant still in its couse and shining. And ha∣uing of late presented your Royall father with a small booke of Meditations, and a Suite. So re∣nuing the said Suite, I mak bold now againe to present your Grace with these most rude and most vnpolisht lines, but honest matter, and not vnfit for your contemplation, which my poore Mus hauing wandred round the World to gather, layes downe at length at your Prince∣ly feete (as a measure of sweetes and spices) brought from the gardens of India: vpon which if it please your Grace to cast but the least beame of your bright splendor and perfection, it kin∣dles in me such a flame of affectionate zeale to to your Princely seruice, as the length of time can neuer extinguish.
