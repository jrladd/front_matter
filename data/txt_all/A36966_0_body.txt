May it please your GRACE,
I HAD not presum'd to trouble you with the read∣ing
this Trifle, had I not bin proud of an Oc∣casion
of Dedicating my self, as well as it, to your
service: Scribles of this Nature are usually de∣sign'd
only to insinuate the Author into the good Opini∣on
of his Patron; but besides that, my Lord, I must
confess another meaning, and acknowledge this Minute
my happiest, since it gives me an Opportunity of pro∣strating
my self, and Book, at the Feet of a true, Loy∣al
English Nobleman, whose Virtues Lineally descended,
have justly received no blemish; One who may, like the
Heroes of Old, suffer depressions through the want of Iu∣stice,
from byass'd or mistaken Opinions; but never through
want of Merit. Besides my own humble Acknowledge∣ments,
my Lord, for the favours I have particularly re∣ceived
from your Grace; I think it is my Duty, and in∣deed
the Duty of every good Subject, as well as my self,
with Tears of Ioy, to thank you for your late Loyalty,




Dilence, and unwearied service of the King, against
the Rebels; in which you faithfully shew'd the unvalued
Vertue of your Temper, sparing no Cost, nor ommitting
no Stratagem, that could advance to the eternal fixing our
Great (tho' then scarce settl'd) Monarch in this Throne;
as once your Immortal, and I hope (never forgotten) Fa∣ther,
did the late glorious Prince before. We cannot
now doubt, but that Almighty Providence has pronoun∣ced
a long and happy Reign to our Great and Glorious
Master; his late wonderful, as well as fortunate suc∣cess,
sufficiently shews the Eternal Arm was lifted
for him, in the Miraculous and speedy scattering and
confounding so formidable an Eenmy, as the Rebels
were, or wou'd have bin, upon the least fleshing and en∣couragement.
Nor shall we ever, I hope, forget your Gra∣ces
Indefatigable Zeal, Policy and Diligence, in defen∣ding
and keeping a City, which they so vehemently
aim'd at, as highly conducing to their Designs; this
was a Piece of Service, which (without offence to any
one) I hope I may presume to say, none but the Son of
a Restorer could have done, the Brood of Rankest Re∣bellion,
like the Plague, having reign'd there long be∣fore;
and the Mobile being all poison'd with the per∣nitious
Tenets of a misled, ungrateful Vsurper;
who some years since took his Progress that way, to
prepare the Party for this purpose. This, Sir, your
very Enemies (if it is possible you can have any) must
acknowledge: Nor can I omit the Conflicts of your Gra∣ces
vexation, and dissatisfaction, by being disappointed




of ingaging the Enemy, as you heartily wish'd, and en∣deavour'd
to do: I know the Noble Old General's Geni∣us
inspir'd ye; and your Martial Spirit even burnt with
the Lust of Action; you might well be said in this jun∣cture,
to be tortur'd with as much rage for not fighting,
and Conquering, as a Masterly Poet has written of
your Glorious Father, when in the late Dutch War In∣gaging
almost a whole Fleet, he was disabled by Du
Ruyter.
Ruyter he spies, and full of Martial heat,
Tho' half the Number, thinks the Odds too great;
And swoln with Sense of former Glory won,
Thought Monk must be by Albemarle out-done
And at last describing the Fight, and the General's Rage
for the ill success, he goes on,
Not Virtuous Men, unworthily abus'd;
Not constant Lover, without Cause refus'd:
Not honest Merchant broke, nor skilful Player
Hiss'd off the Stage, nor sinners in despair;
Not Parents mock'd, not Favourites disgrac'd,
Not Rump by Monk or Oliver displac'd;
Not Kings depos'd, nor Prelates e're they dye,
Feel half the rage of Generals when they flye.
This, tho' on a Contrary Theam, I am sure is not
Improperly adapted; your inward and secret disturbance




for being depriv'd of the Glory you hop'd for, being right∣ly
considered, was not less, than that of your Noble Father.
And now, my Lord, for fear of troubling your Grace
with two prolix an Epistle, which cannot excuse my
fault, for the meanness of what I present ye, I must
make use of the Confidence, natural to Poets; and
briefly beg to shelter my self under your Graces Patronage;
whose true Vertue, and uncommon Sweetness, in favouring
Wit and Merit, where-ever you find it, emboldens me to ex∣pect
a favourable reception, in hopes, that the true Eng∣lish
Noble Temper, which influences all Mankind with
Admiration, that have the Honour to know you, will not
fail to bless particularly with your good Opinion, and par∣don
the Errors, and Presumption of,
My LORD,
