Honourable Sir,
GOD having first pitched my medita∣tions upon the study after an establish∣ment in this perish∣ing World, and sha∣king times in which we live, and in this study more emminently then be∣fore, made knowne himselfe in the Lord Jesus Christ to be that Rocke of Ages which never failes such as trust in him, he did then draw forth my heart
upon a principle of common good  hold that forth to the World which he had made known to me, that so if God would blesse it to the end I intended it every soule might be as happy in a fixed state as my selfe; this is truly my end in publishing that to others, which God did in secret imprint upon my heart: Now in the publishing of this, I take boldnes to Dedicate it to your self, but if any aske why I doe so, I shall render them these two Reasons.
First, it is proper for me to tender re∣spects to one from whom I have receiv∣ed so many, I shall be short in this and say no more, but that I remaine your Debtor.
My second reason is this, Though the subject be of generall tendency to the wants of all Gods people, yet such as God puts most worke upon have most
need of this support, such as fight and contend with the enemies of God ei∣ther within them or without them, will finde faith in God to be their best wea∣pon; that God hath emminently called and used you in such a weighty work I need produce no proofes to the World, God himselfe hath done it; what God hath further for you to doe I know not, but this I know that faith in him will be your greatest strength in doing, and a certaine rest what ever your worke maybe; for this reason also I present this to your hands, the scope and sub∣stance of which I believe hath streng∣thened your heart and hand in all that concernes you here and for ever. Your enemies say you have done much, but I beleeve the voyce of your owne heart is, that God hath done all himselfe, wherein he hath used you
as an instrument; What is yet behind for you to doe or suffer God only knows: This I dare boldly affirme, faith in God will be your best companion and your surest rest in all conditions; therefore Sir, in sincere love I present my service and this Treatise of the rest of Faith to your hands, the Lord goe with it to your heart, and make himselfe your rest here and forever, which is the re∣all desire of him that truely loves you, and in love will be ready to serve you in the worke of the Lord, whilst I remaine,
