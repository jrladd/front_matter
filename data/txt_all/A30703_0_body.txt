My LORD,
I Have made humbly bold to fix your Name before these Sermons, not to en∣title your Grace to any the weakness that may have escaped therein (in some kind the inseparable attendant of humane frailty:) but to testifie the respect and duty under which I stand obliged, which is de∣servedly yours. Besides, the tender of them may seem, in point of right, firstly to belong un∣to your Grace, being Preached (and by ap∣pointment) at your Metropolitical Visitation.
The favourable acceptance of them from the Pulpit, giving hope of no less candid enter∣tainment from the Press, is one main motive to
 make them publick. Perhaps there may be that in them, which may conduce not onely to the advantage of the Churches Sons in their Establishments; but to the conviction of o∣thers, who through weakness, or perversness may be gone astray, and have left the fold; and so become instrumental for their orderly re∣duction. Ʋpon these accounts I was not un∣willing to cast them upon the waters. Such as they are, I here humbly present them to your Grace, as a real testimony, that I am
My LORD,
