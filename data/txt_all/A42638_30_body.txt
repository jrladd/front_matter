THe Greatest Practisers of Musick, who live at Lisbon, & in all the Algarves, are reported to repair A las Orillas de la Mar, to sing as loud as possibly they can, to hear whether it sounds well: To you whose deep judg∣ment could not suffer your Eyes to fix on slight objects as too ma∣ny Travellers have done, to you, whose fame, to my experimental knowledge, caused the greatest Vertuosi to busie their admira∣tion, as eminent as the true suc∣cessour of Thales, who found the North for Navigation, the Divi∣sion of Years, the Proportion of the Sun and Moon, that Souls



are Immortal; who answered the Question, what God is, viz. To be the eldest of all Antiqui∣ties; the World the most beau∣tifull Object, Place the biggest, Time most knowing, God, Vir∣tue, and Truth the strongest.
To you as to other Worthies of the Age, is offered this liule Counsel and Advise concerning Building; for you have seen the various rarieties of Frescati, Ca∣prarola, Vigna Lodowizi, and all what is rare throughout all Italy and other parts of Europe; and therefore as you can judge right of this matter, so recommend the Advise given concerning the same to your friends, which may be a benefit unto them; and this is all that is aimed at by me,
Honourable Sir,
