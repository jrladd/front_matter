Right Honourable:
HAuing knowne you so ancient a Hearer, and which makes a true Disciple of Christ, so care∣full a practiser of Religion, I presumed therefore this Prin∣cipall dish of Spirituall meate, would not bee vnwelcome to you, as I know it will bee more welcome to the World, after so great and good a taster as your selfe: And though I may safely say (as one long be∣fore mee) All Gods dishes are dainties; yet doubtlesse this of the Sacraments ca∣rieth with it a peculiar Excellencie: And I bring it in first, not that there are not o∣thers to come in before it, but for the ge∣nerall vse and present necessitie of it euen at this time: That this may serue first to stay and comfort many weake and then
 if it may bee, to satisfie certaine curious and squeasie stomackes amongst vs: Who some of them about the Sacrament of Baptisme, others in some circumstantiall matters concerning the Lords Supper, haue kindled such a fire of contention in the Church, as now diuers of them would bee glad with many teares to quench if they knew how. It hath pleased God who workes euen by weake meanes, by my words in publike and priuate to satis∣fie many, if by writing also I may doe good to them that cannot heare mee, let the glory bee His, the comfort theirs, and the seruice acceptable to the Church; So the labour shall willingly bee mine: and I shall take joy and comfort in such cour∣ses, in Pulpit and by Penne, Preaching, writing, and conferring to spend and end the few dayes I haue remaining, and so to make ready for a better life. And where∣in (Madame) any of my labours may be seruiceable to you or yours. Commaund mee,
