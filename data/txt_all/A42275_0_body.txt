MADAM,
I Have in obedience to your Ladyships Commands turned into English so much of the Count Gualdo his Book, as your Noble and Worthy Lord and Husband (being prevented by Death) left un∣translated.
I am not ignorant how great a rash∣ness and presumption it was heretofore accounted, for an unskilful Workman to attempt the finishing of Apelles Table; but I shall hope the meanness of my Stile will give your Ladyship no cause of offence, when you consi∣der that the defects thereof are so far from prejudicing your Lord's Work, that like a Foil they may serve to adde something unto the Lustre of it: And I am confident I shall deserve from the Reader his Thanks as well as Pardon, for blundering at the remainder of the Book, since 'tis the cause of publishing the rest, whereby our Nation may have the benefit of being acquainted with all Designes, Intrigues, and Affairs of State, transacted in those years whereof it treats, delivered to them by the choice Pens of two persons so accomplished as were the Author and his Lordship.
And howsoever, I have resolved rather to expose my self un∣to the danger of any Censure whatsoever, than be wanting to the profession I have made of being,
MADAM,
