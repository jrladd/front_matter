May it please Your Honours,
I Humbly present You with this
little Tract, the Design whereof
is to set forth how Useful and
Advantageous a Well Setled redit
would be to the Nation, which, no∣thing
but a Sence of the Calami∣ty
we labour under for want of it

hath made me Undertake; 'Tis a
Subject I Confess deserves a better
Pen, but seeing it hath lain so long
Neglected, I have adventured to of∣fer
my Mite towards it; If Your
Honours agree it to be Necessary,
I doubt not but it may be rendred
Practicable; The setling the Coyn
of this Kingdom (so happily ef∣fected
in your last Sessions) hath
given fresh Occasions to our Money
Mongers to imploy their Corrupt
Wits in finding out new Ways to
elude your good Intentions, who since
they cannot get Thirty per Cent by

ping our Old Money, have endea∣voured
to get Twenty per Cent by
Hoarding up our New, Things equal∣ly
prejudicial in themselves; And so
far have they already advanced in
these their wicked Projects, as to
make near so much Difference be∣tween
our Money and our Trade;
Which Evil, if not speedily prevented,
will daily Increase, and like a Le∣prosie
over-spread this Nation, so
that the very Sence of its being a
Crime will wear off, and Time will
make it familiar to those, who now
seem to startle at it; Dulcis Odor

Lucri ex re Qualiabet. Nor can a
Stop be put thereto so well, as by Esta∣blishing
a Credit, large enough to an∣swer
all the Occasions of the Nation, both
Publick and Private, without which,
I humbly Conceive, other Means will
prove Ineffectual; I pray God, who
is the Fountain of Wisdom, to di∣rect
you Councels to his Glory, and
the Welfare of this Kingdom.
