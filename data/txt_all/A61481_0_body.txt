I Having been much importuned to publish these following Ser∣mons, preached on the Parable of Dives and Lazarus, I thought I could not dedicate them so properly to any, as to You, who were constant∣ly present when they were delivered by me. I know that I must be sub∣ject to Censures; but since these Dis∣courses were well designed, and if they take that effect, I wish and heartily pray for, I shall be the more easie under harsh Judgments. I have not made any Alterations in them, but have sent them abroad in that Dress they were preached in, on purpose that the meanest Capacities may understand, and be benefited by them. And if so, I shall think my self well rewarded for my Labours. They may serve to acquaint you with the after state of good and bad
Men, and to prepare you for those blessed Mansions above: And there∣fore I think it not improper, if they were given away at Funerals, to prevent those Discourses which are generally used by the invited Guests, and to possess their Minds with the thoughts of another World, very suitable to such solemn Occasions; Here Persons that mourn for the Deaths of good Friends and Rela∣tions, may receive Comfort, their Souls being carried by the Angels into Abraham's Bosom. The Para∣ble being so large and comprehen∣sive, I shall say the less concerning it, but refer you to the serious and can∣did perusal of the several Discourses preached upon it: Which, that they may so affect, as to reform and fit you for Heaven, is the earnest Wish, and hearty Prayer of your unworthy Servant,
