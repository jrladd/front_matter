May it please Your Grace,
I Do not Dedicate this Book to You for any Interest I have In You, or for any Preferment I seek From You; who may say as the Woman, with whom the Prophet sojourned; I have nothing to be spoken for to the King; I dwell a∣mong
my own People; being One that Conform Not as a Minister, but go to Church as a Parishioner, and Study to be quiet: But I lay these Sheets at the Feet of the Church, by Handing them to Your Grace, in regard to the Orb You are pla∣ced in, and in respect to the Sub∣ject I have undertaken.
I do likewise Present it to Your Grace, as One (I understand) that do Love, and will Find a Time to Read, notwithstanding the Multi∣plicity and Weight of Your Affairs; being not Lifted up with Greatness, or Delighted so much in the Sun∣shine even of the Court, as in Re∣tiring to the Shade of Your Books at Home: Who are One conse∣quently, that is like to Read the Book, and make Your Own Judg∣ment
of it; and if You find any thing in it serviceable to God, are in Place to Move, and Promote it; as, if the Attempt be amiss, can, by Your proper Instruction, ap∣point some sit Person, to Reprove and Answer it, that the Publick re∣ceive no Detriment by it.
I must confess, I am of the O∣pinion, That the Notion and Do∣ctrine Of and Concerning the Church, and Churches of Christ upon Earth, which is generally received as Or∣thodox, is not consistent with our Publick Practice, and the Being of our Mixt Churches; and could not therefore, when Time was, Declare my unfeigned Assent and Consent to all things in the Liturgy; because I must then have both prevented this Book, and consen∣ted
to Some Thing in Point of Do∣ctrine and Ʋse (which will be nam'd in its Place) as by a Consequence un∣avoidable to me, does give up the Field to the Separatist. And when (if I may speak a Consequential Truth) I am One, that have be∣come herein a kind of Martyr, in my loss of all Emolument with∣in the Church, for my Resolution and Endeavour of maintaining the Churches Cause; so that there does appear something Meritorious in my Nonconformity, though nothing at all in My Self; what if I Re∣vive a late Motion made to Your Grace, That You will hearken to those Papers of mine, Entitu∣led, Three Steps in order to the ob∣taining my Liberty to Preach; which being desired for Occasional Ser∣mons
only, without Benefice, Dig∣nity, Living or Lecture, I have, in my Third Step, brought the Matter to this Issue, That if You will concede to me but what a∣ny Bishop may do by Law, and impune also by the Canons, I may have Your License for the Ʋse of my Ministry, and yet keep my Own Conscience in the Case?
