My worthy good Cousin,
HAving thus trans∣planted this little Leane-too, from the calmnesse of my private Nur∣sery into the bleak and open Champion; and not knowing how much it there may suffer by the stormie Gusts of cen∣sure without some Extraordinarie stake supporting it, I thus betake me to your owne good selfe for pro∣tection, and if you please to passe it

under the value of your Name, misdoubt not the successe, and shall with much cheerfulnesse intercept all further opportunities of acknow∣ledging my selfe,
