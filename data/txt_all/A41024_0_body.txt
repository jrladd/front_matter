My Lord,
THE Author of this Comedy having left it to my disposal, I was glad of the opportunity to make a publick acknowledgment of those favours, which your Grace's Bounty has confer'd upon me in the view of the World. All that know me, know that the little Stock of Reputation I have in the Town is intirely owing to the Honour your Lordship do's me, to own me for yours. There are few, but will en∣vy me the Ambition of that word, yet to be in a condition to deserve their envy, is a satisfastion so great, as cannot be conceal'd. To depend upon a person of your Grace's Merit and Figure, is advantageous in all respects; for as it adds to a Man's Character, it also effectually recommends him to the esteem of all People whose Quality or Ʋnderstanding makes their Fa∣vours desirable. So that Interest as well as Gratitude obliges me to value my self upon it. What I here present your Grace, was some time since given into my hands, and from that moment design'd for your Protection, but by the dilatory practices of some (whose design I am a Stranger to) has been kept till now from waiting upon your Lordship, for whose protection I always intended it. I am not a suffici∣ent Judge of its worth, for tho Musick and Poetry are generally counted Twins, my acquaintance is but with one of 'em. Nay, I must own to your Grace that I am so little a Poet as not to make bold with your Character. I have more Modesty than to attempt, what I dare not hope to succeed in. Nor would I be so much wanting to my Duty as to draw your Grace to disadvantage. The design of this Epistle is only to beg your Patronage for a Play, which may want it among so many Criticks as the Town swarms with, and to let all mankind know what just reason I have to be with all Zeal and Humility,
My Lord,
