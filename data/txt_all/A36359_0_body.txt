My Lord!
THough a too prevalent custom has rendred Dedi∣cations little more than Complemental Follies, wherein Authors first make themselves, and next their Patrons, ridiculous, by extravagant Harangues; yet I cannot but be free from all suspitions of such vanity in Addressing these Papers to your Lordships hand, whose solid worth is as much above, as neglectful of popular Ap∣plause. I come not to make you a Present, but to pay you a Tribute; The Loyalty, Prudence, Justice, and Mode∣ration your Lordship exercises in that Honourable, but weighty Charge wherewith you are entrusted, and the zeal and stedfastness you have shown to the Protestant Religion, in these tempestuous times (when some that seem'd fixed stars, have been found but Blazing Meteors), just∣ly intitles you to the Respects and Gratitude of all true Pro∣testants and Englishmen; not only in this mighty City, wherein (under His Majesty, whom God long preserve) you preside, but throughout the Nation too, by the influence of your generous Example to other Magistrates.
Besides which, my own private Obligations to your Lordships Candor and Impartial Audience, when humbly requested, loudly call for some publick Acknowledgments from me, who cannot but receive comfort under all Discou∣ragements that have, or may happen, when I consider, That a person of your Lordships Integrity and Merit cannot es∣cape the Frowns (shall I call them? or rather Snarlings) of some little pretenders to the Protestant Interest, which really they desert through Ignorance, or maliciously endea∣vour to betray.
Nor know I how better to Implore your Lordships par∣don for the presumption of this Address, than by professing in all sincerity, That the Motives inducing me to publish this Narrative, were principally the Glory of God, the Ho∣nour and Safety of the King, and the preservation of the true Protestant Religion; and secondarily in order to those ends, the strengthning of all Protestants against a most perverse, subtile and cruel Generation, who with restless Endeavours seek to overthrow the same; Rendred yet more dangerous, because some weak unthinking people are too easily deluded to own, Countenance and Abet (though per∣haps unwittingly) such their mischievous Designs. And lastly, That if there be any Papists sincere in their mis∣guided Devotion, the horrid practises of the Leading men of that faction (nakedly display'd) may open their Eyes, and convince them so far, as to abandon that pernici∣ous Communion, and embrace the Truth, thereby becoming at once true Christians and good Subjects to their true and natural Prince.
This being the only scope, I am bold to promise my self a Connivence for any imperfections of stile or method, my aim herein being Truth, not Rhetorick. That the Al∣mighty may ever bless your Honour, and preserve this Noble City both from the Treacherous Malice, and Crafty Insinuations of Romish Incendiaries, shall be the daily prayer of,
My Lord!
