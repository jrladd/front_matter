THis Play, composed by so worthy an Authour as Mr. Marlo; and the part of the Jew presented by so vnimi∣table an Actor as Mr. Allin, being in this later Age com∣mended to the Stage: As I vsher'd it unto the Court, and presented it to the Cock-pit, with these Prologues and E∣pilogues here inserted, so now being newly brought to the Iresse, I was loath it should be published without the ornament of an Epistle; making choyce of you vnto whom to deuote it; then whom (of all those Gentlemen and acquaintance, within the compasse of my long knowledge) there is none more able to taxe

Ignorance, or attribute right to merit. Sir, you haue bin pleased to grace some of mine owne workes with your curteous patronage; I hope this will not be the worse accepted, because commended by mee; ouer whom, none can clayme more power or priuilege than your selfe. I had no better a New-yeares gift to present you with; receiue it therefore as a continuance of that in∣uiolable obliegement, by which, he rests stil ingaged; who as he euer hath, shall alwayes remaine,
