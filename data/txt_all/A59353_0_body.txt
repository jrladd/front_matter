MY LORD,
HOnour ever looks Lovelyest, and
shines Brightest, when 'tis the Re∣compence
and Meed of Virtue; so
great is the Difference between a Present
and a Reward? Your Lordship ascends the
Praetorial Chair under the last Qualification.
Your Merits have planted You so fair a
Mark for that Dignity You have received,
that it is payd, not given You. And the Una∣nimous
acknowledgements of all good
Men are so sensible of a Desert so conspi∣cuous,
that their concurring best Wishes
make you one United Congratulation.
And that Your Lordship has so deserved,
your Constant Zeal for the Honour of Your
Country, is not the Business of Yesterday.
Your Lordship set out an early Devote
in so worthy a Cause. For Instance, seve∣ral
Years together in those memorable
Days, when Intrigue & Designe sat high at
the Helm, Your unshaken Honour and Hone∣sty
were thought so dangerous to the then

State-Hammerers at the Anvil, that no less
then Court-Power was pleased to rise up &
wage against You, witness the several po∣tent,
Oppositions made against you and
your long Exclusion from your Right∣ful
Entrance into Trust. But thanks to Pro∣vidence,
under the present more benign,
& more auspicious Administration, a Reign
where Integrity qualifies for Magistracy,
& the Courtier & the Patriot are not names
incompatible, your Lordships Glory of
being the Fear of that Age, intitles you to
the Darling of this. And our proud Metro∣polis
receives her saluted PRAEIOR so
pleased at your Inauguration, and with such
promising confidence of so upright and
unbiast a Ministry of Equity & Justice from
your Lordship that she never entrusted
her Scales and her Sword in a Worthier
Hand. In which high post of Honour, I
joyn but in the Universal Quire, when all
Prosperity and Hoppiness to your Lordship
are most heartily wisht by, My Lord,
