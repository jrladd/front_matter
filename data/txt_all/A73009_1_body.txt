Worthy Mistresse,
IT may seeme vnsutable with your Sex and Rank to commend a Trea∣tise of Fallowing to a Woman, such a Woman. But no matter. Wo∣men somewhere pretend this way as much skill as men, and shame not sometimes to goe forth into the field to hacking. This poore messenger therefore admit I beseech you as from my Ma∣ster sent to hire you to work as well as others; if not to plowing, at lest to hacking; but thus in∣terpreting. The field you must worke in must bee your heart; the furrowes to be beaten vp, your sinnes, corruptions, lusts; the sword of the spi∣rit

(Gods word) your mattock; your taske mor∣tification. If wages you looke for, no doubt at Euening, when your work is ended, the Penny-Royall of eternall life. Come, shame not such honest paynes for your spirituall liuing; We stick not oft-times other wayes to bestow much more on temporall.
 Columpton April 30. 1632.
