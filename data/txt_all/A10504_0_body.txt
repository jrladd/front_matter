THE strong obligation uuherein, throu your spe∣cial humanite, y find mi∣self right straightli obli∣gid and bound, uuil in no uuise suffer forgetfulnes of the infinite benefites daili receauid at your hands in to mi mindful mind to make eni unlau∣ful entree. But continualli calling on, & setting before mine inuuard eyes, on thone side, the uuaighti burden of bound dueti, on thouther, the feoble correspondencie of mi smal poure, engendrith in mi fantasi so perplex and douteful deliberation, that cōparing the remissnes of mi slender poure, uuith the excess of your singular meri∣tes, y can conceaue but smal hope uuith so litil force, euer to discarge me of so greate and graue a bond. Notuuithstanding, uuilling in this behalf to ensue the example of honest dettars, as ye, I am certain, do of gē∣til Creditors, uuhereas y am not able at one paiment, to aquite the total sum of mi due det, if as pour, time, pla∣ce, and occation do geue, y declare mi self, in that y mai, sumuuhat touuards, and readili uuilling, y dout not but your uuont curtesi uuil accept diligēt endeuar, in place
of a meane contentation. Vuhereas a feu moneths passid, ye bought, onli oppon mi commendation, a certain por∣tion of the Oile, surnamid Imperial, thereoppon requi∣ring me to uurite you a short memori of the most nota∣ble qualitees thereof, so soone as conuenient leasar uuold suffer me, parteli to perfurm mi promes to the inuentor of the said Oile longsith made, but cheifli glad to embra∣ce this occation, uuherebi y mought seeme to haue found sum matter, therein to shou the inclination of mi hart touuards the accomplisshemēt of eni your uertuous de∣sires, y fourthuuith toke in hand to compile, as ye see, this simple and rude treatise. The uuhiche, albeit it shal mani∣festli appere far & uuide disansuuerable, bothe to your expectation, mi desire, and also the uuoorthines of the matter, yet y trust ye uuil haue respect rather to the prompt good uuil of one, uuhiche in eueri thing to his utter, is muche fainar to gratifie, then hable, to satisfie suche his rare & approuid frind. And in your so doing, ye shal encrease in me sprite and courage, by litil and li∣til, to excogitate hereaffter sum matter more peraduen∣ture aggreable bothe to your appetite, and also mi fan∣tasi. In the meane uuhile, fare ye most harteli uuel. From Venice the first of Marche.
