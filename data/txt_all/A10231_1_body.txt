ABoue thirteene yeeres are passed since first your Graces auspicious name graced the Frontispice of this Pilgrimage, which pro∣mising the World and her Religions in foure Parts, hath (onely and that foure times) performed One. And as a late Queene ambitious of Souereigntie to all her Sonnes, found the Mathematicians which had foretold it, true, but her hopes false, that falling out by fatall succession in one Kingdom which shee had exspected and indeuoured in diuers: so hath this our First-borne with successiue improuements beene so often the sole heire and successor to himselfe. Now the Fourth time doth this Pilgrimage glory in your Graces benediction, and although my trauelling braine hath not beene deliuered of those
 promised Pilgrimages, yet bath it by a strange superfaetation pro∣created & lately presented to kisse your Graces hand, foure twins of Pilgrimes, which did not indeede formally pay the former debt, yet presumed to yeeld that which should bee as vsefull to the World in the knowledge of her remoter parts. These issues exhausting their Parents procreatiue powers, his hastned age expects & exacts Rest for the rest; and now for This, hauing been often quarelled for forcing men by frequent Additions in later Editions to renew their purchase of Purchas his renewed Pilgri∣mage, though he durst not bestow a Childs portion on it, yet would he not send it forth without a Fathers blessing. The Three Treatises annexed had found fitter place with my Pilgrimes, had they then comne to my hands: but their rarities merit a place, yea a welcome, in what place soeuer.
For the Author, if his reiterated paines; if his here borrowing of aboue thirteene hundred Authors of one or other kind, in I know not how many hundreths of their Epistles, Treatises and Relations; if his weekly redoubled cares of the Pulpit, daily and howerly of a weak body and not strong family; if the Argument it selfe being of Religions (though irreligious) to a most Reuerend and religious Prelate; if the worlds approbation pressing it to so often view and censure; if None of these, if All of them may not excuse so often resumed presumption on your Grace, yet is he for∣ced by necessarie dutie, and the sum of all duties. Thankefulnes. Yea this I am sure will be full excuse, if not commendation, of that which I haue foure times obtruded, the testimonie of our late de∣ceassed Soueraine of happie memorie (the King of literature also) King IAMES, who shewing me it by him in his Bed-chamber, said, that he had read it seuen times: Whereto if I should adde his iudicious questions of diuers particulars therein, his ready and milde satisfaction, his ample commendation, copious discourse, piercing wit, admirable memory, gentle affabilitie, I might seeme to some emulous carpers to magnifie my self, in relating that truth which rather indeede doth illustrate to all posteritie his worth then my worthinesse, God and Gods greatest Vicegerents, deligh∣ting rather to shew Grace then to admit Plea of Merit. It plea∣sed
 his Maiestie to enquire further of the different scope of my Pilgrimage, & my then presented Pilgrims, which here also for the Readers sake I think fit to answer; that These Brethren hold∣ing much resemblance in name, nature and feature, yet differ both in the obiect and subiect: This being mine own in matter (though borrowed) and in forme of words and method: Whereas my Pil∣grims are the Authors themselues, acting their owne parts in their owne words, onely furnished by me with such necessaries as that stage further required, and ordered according to my rules; here is a Pilgrimage to the Temples of the Worlds Citie, reli∣gionis ergo, with obuious and occasionall view of other things; there is a full Ʋoyage, and in a method of Ʋoyages, the whole Citie of the World, propounded together with the Temples; here the soule and some accessories, there the body and soule of the re∣moter World, with (98) her rarer furniture; this from the eare, that from the eye, this briefer notes, that the Text it selfe. How euer, such was his Maiesties fauour as to adde for my further encouragement, his promise to heare at large all those Pilgrims, which was nightly also performed, vntill his fatall sicknesse called him to enioy a nightlesse day in the heauenly Kingdome.
Euen the last day on which this Citie saw him, it pleased him with gracious approbation of the former, to impose another taske on me, by an Honourable messenger, with promise of reward, which had almost in a dangerous sickenesse buried me, and was buried (with those hopes) in his Maiesties graue; whose Fune∣rals this Citie hath beene forced euer since to solemnise, with ar∣mies of Mourners pressed by Pestilence, to attend & follow His Corps with their owne: And if some liuing remaines of him had not shined in his Sonne King CHARLES, in that Sun-set, what a Chaos of darkenesse had befalne vs, which lost that day, and yet saw no night? And long may your Grace shine as a Starre of greatest magnitude, attending neere our happy Charles-waine, and euer may that Royall Race bee the Load-starre of our Church and State vnder the Sunne of righteousnesse, euen so long as Bootes shall attend on that bright constellation.

May it please your Grace to pardon this talkatiue boldnesse, and to permit mee also to mention your late fauour, and secon∣ding that Royall testimonie, when notwithstanding the dreadfull infection, your gracious affection admitted free communication with me, intended a free and bountifull Collation on me, and ex∣tended so large a collaudation to those my Pilgrimes; neither by their voluminous prolixitie deterred from reading them; nor then deterring my suspended scrupulous thoughts by your iudicious seueritie, but with ingenuous sinceritie yeelding a testimonie so a∣ble and ample, that though I blush to record it, yet I now repent not of so vast vndertakings, which such iudgement deemeth so profitable, that the studious in this kind of literature neede goe no further: which was the scope of those voluminous Collections, to coniure as it were all Trauelling spirits into that one Pilgrime-centre, and at once to make the World Eye-witnesse to it selfe. Let me glorie further that my Volumes are admitted into your Graces Li∣brarie, and my selfe an appendix of your family and
