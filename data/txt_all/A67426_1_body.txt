THe Complaint of a woman hapning unto her as it did unto him which was borne blind in the 9 Chap∣ter of S. Iohn, this man being inlightened by Jesus Christ: would not blame him but spoke well of him, for which cause he was cast out of the sinnagogue in the same maner this woman aknowledgeth, to have beene blind a long time, I meane of a spirituall blindnesse but after shee was Illuminated she could not endure to heare, that Doctri∣ne ill spoken of by the which shee was inlightened, where∣of shee advised many simple folkes, fearing they should be deceiued by false and erronious Doctrine, for this
thing shee is thereatned to be cast out of the sinagogue, which is to say excommunicated, therefore shee sheweth the cause why they would do her this reproach, and sets forth divers points, which have beene preached falsely with hope that God will enable her to maintaine them, unto her last drop of Blood.
Cantorbury, Anno Dom: 1645.
