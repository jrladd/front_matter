Beloved,
IT is not unknown to you, that I voluntari∣ly left a very loving people, and a more beneficial place, to come among you, and reside with you, expecting (and not with∣out reason) a more then ordinary success of my poor labours, with a retaliation of affection from you: But through the malicious subtilty of some abroad, and the notorious hypocrisie of others at home, I have been strangely frustrate in my expectation: Yet (I hope) there are among you some, who will give me cause to say, I have not laboured in vain. God (the Searcher of all hearts) shall witness for me, that I have not ceas'd to declare unto you, while I was with you, even the whole counsel of God, especially by those Doctrines which I con∣ceived to be most needful and necessary for you: And being now departing from you, I commend this poor Piece as a lasting monument of my Affection to you; Therefore (I pray) accept this free will Offering with the same hand and heart it is tendered to you. I have not wrote any thing to the prejudice of the person of the Author of the Da∣logue, whose Christian Moderation in many things, is knwn to many; whose holy conversation may be a pattern to most; yet I am not willing that Truth should suffer by the hand of any whatsoever, much less be wounded by those that pretend to be her best friends, and make an escape in
 a croud, without any notice taken of it. I do not, cannot look to escape censures abroad, no more then St Paul did perils, and among the rest, especially by false Brethren, who are possessed with such a spirit of Pride and Bitterness, that scorning and reviling the works of others, how pain∣ful and elaborate soever, they think nothing well done, but what they do themselves: Let me therefore (my good friends) find kindness and curtesie from you at home, lest it repent me, not that I undertook, and by Gods mercy fi∣nished, but that ever I published these weak endeavours of mine. I have here unmasked Errour and Heresie, that you may the better see them, and seeing, know them, and knowing, avoid them, when you shall meet them in what ever Paint or Dress of Piety and Purity they shall seek to shroud or shelter themselves, so that you be not deceived by them.
I have made use of such Authors in the managing of this high and holy business, as have gone before me, and were needful for me: They (I suppose) may pass currant without any prejudice, or prejudicial censure: But my self, and what is mine, do importune your favour, which, I presume, will be the easier attained, in regard we both in∣tend nothing but good unto you.
We are they (my friends) upon whom the very Ends of the World are come; in which, not only homo homini Lupus, one man is a Wolf to another, preying upon the Body, Name, and Estate; but homo homini Daemon, one man is a Divel to another, labouring to ensnare and betray the Souls, the precious Souls one of another. It is very necessary then that we take heed unto our selves, that we be not slightly carryed on to our own destruction. What caution the Apostle gave his Colossians, the same do I give to you; Let no man spoil you through Philoso∣phy
 and vain deceit: And further give me leave to say, let no man spoil you through Divinity and vain deceit: For no doubt, but the Serpent hath his poyson in his head, as well as his tayl; and the Divel hath his baits as cun∣ningly set on, and as covertly laid in the depths of Divi∣nity, as in the shallows of Philosophy: yea rather did he attempt to have spoyl'd the great Commander of Divines with the Theorems of Divinity, then with the Rudiments of Philosophy; he can frame either, or both, according to the times, places, or persons with whom he hath to deal, to serve his purpose, and make for his advantage.
Let us then consider, what is, or ought to be the credit, countenance, and authority of him that writeth any thing in publike; not his Person, though it be Comly; nor his Deportment, though it be Demure; nor his Name, though it be Famous; nor his Learning, though it be Profound, nor his Language, though it be Pleasing; nor his Stile, though it be Smooth. But rather the Spirit (if not only the Spirit) by which he is guided. For otherwise were he as grave and ancient as Melchisedech, as wise and well learned as Solomon, as eloquent and well-spoken as Aa∣ron, were he brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, or might he sit in the Gates of the City for his Judgment and great ability, yet if in these the Spirit of Truth accompany him not, we are so far from receiving any good from him, that there is the more danger to be infected by him.
And though the only or special credit of him that wri∣teth, be the Spirit by which he doth it; yet we must not be∣lieve every one that pretendeth he hath the Spirit. There are many false Prophets gone out into the world, and ma∣ny times (such are the unseasoned and unsavoury judge∣ments of men) they are taken, though mistaken, to have the Spirit of Truth, which indeed are but Spirits of Er∣ror:
 And again, they are esteem'd as Spirits of Error, in whom the spirit of Truth doth reside, and hath taken up his Habitation. We had need therefore be the more care∣ful, to what and whom we do give heed, so as to follow, or be led by it; and how we judge, lest we be judged for it. Now the very God of Truth, by his spirit, the spirit of Truth, guide us into all Truth, and keep us blameless therein, that we waver not our selves, nor give occasion to others to re∣proach it, by our disorderly walking in the Profession of it; which is the earnest Prayer, and hath been the careful en∣deavour of
May the 13. 1656.
