MADAM,
WHEN I reflect upon the infinite disputes which have troubled the publick meetings of Christendom concerning Original Sin, and how impatient and vext some men lately have been, when I offered to them my endeavours and conjectures concerning that Question, with purposes very differing from what were seen in the face of other mens designs, and had handled it so, that GOD might be glorified in the Article, and men might be instructed and edified in order to good life; I could not but think that wise Heathen said rarely well in his little adagie, relating to the present subject; . Mankind was born to be a riddle, and our na∣tivity is in the dark; for men have taken the liberty to think what they please, and to say what they think; and they affirm many things, and can prove but few things; and take the sayings of men for the Oracles of GOD, and bold affirmatives for convincing argu∣ments; and S. Paul's Text must be understood by S. Austin's com∣mentary, and S. Austin shall be heard in all, because he spake against such men who in some things were not to be heard; and after all, because his Doctrine was taken for granted by ignorant Ages, and being received so long, was incorporated into the resolved Do∣ctrine of the Church, with so great a firmness; it became almost a shame to examine what the world believed so unsuspectingly; and he that shall first attempt it, must resolve to give up a great portion of his reputation to be torn in pieces by the ignorant and by the zealous, by some of the Learned, and by all the Envious; and they who love to

teach in quiet, being at rest in their Chairs and Pulpits will be fro∣ward when they are awakened, and rather than they will be suspected to have taught amiss, will justifie an error by the reproaching of him that tells them truth, which they are pleased to call new.
If any man differs from me in opinion, I am not troubled at it, but tell him that truth is in the Vnderstanding, and charity is in the Will, and is or ought to be there, before either his or my opinion in these controversies can enter, and therefore that we ought to love alike, though we do not understand alike; but when I find that men are angry at my Ingenuity and openness of discourse, and endeavour to hinder the event of my labours, in the ministery of Souls, and are impatient of contradiction or variety of explication, and understand∣ing of Questions, I think my self concerned to defend the truth which I have published, to acquit it from the suspicion of evil appendages, to demonstrate not only the truth, but the piety of it, and the ne∣cessity, and those great advantages which by this Doctrine so under∣stood may be reaped, if men will be quiet and patient, void of preju∣dice and not void of Charity.
This (Madam) is reason sufficient why I offer so many justifi∣cations of my Doctrine, before any man appears in publick against it; but because there are many who do enter into the houses of the rich and the honourable, and whisper secret oppositions and accusa∣tions rather than arguments against my Doctrine; the good Women that are zealous for Religion, and make up in the passions of one fa∣culty what is not so visible in the actions and operations of another, are sure to be affrighted before they be instructed, and men enter ca∣veats in that Court before they try the cause: But that is not all; For I have found, that some men, to whom I gave and designed my labours, and for whose sake I was willing to suffer the persecution of a suspected truth, have been so unjust to me, and so unserviceable to your self (Madam) and to some other excellent and rare perso∣nages, as to tell stories, and give names to my proposition, and by secret murmurs hinder you from receiving that good which your wis∣dom and your piety would have discerned there, if they had not af∣frighted you with telling, that a Snake lay under the Plantane, and that this Doctrine which is as wholsome as the fruits of Paradise, was enwrapped with the infoldings of a Serpent, subtile and falla∣cious.
Madam, I know the arts of these men; and they often put me in mind of what was told me by M. Sackvill the late Earl of Dor∣sets

Vncle; that the cunning Sects of the World (he named the Je∣suits and the Presbyterians) did more prevail by whispering to Ladies, than all the Church of England and the more sober Pro∣testants could do by fine force and strength of argument. For they by prejudice or fears, terrible things, and zealous nothings, confi∣dent sayings and little stories, governing the Ladies Consciences, who can perswade their Lords, their Lords will convert their Te∣nants, and so the World is all their own. I should wish them all good of their profits and purchases if the case were otherwise than it is: but because they are questions of Souls, of their interest and ad∣vantages; I cannot wish they may prevail with the more Reli∣gious and Zealous Personages: and therefore (Madam) I have taken the boldness to write this tedious Letter to you, that I may give you a right understanding and an easie explication of this great Que∣stion; as conceiving my self the more bound to do it to your satisfacti∣on, not only because you are Zealous for the Religion of this Church, and are a person as well of Reason as of Religion, but also because you have passed divers obligations upon me, for which all my services are too little a return.
