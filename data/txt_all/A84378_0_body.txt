SIR,
I Have ever been so sensible of my own manifold Weaknesses, that it was never easie to me to appear in the Pulpit, on any of these more Solemn Occasi∣ons. And hence alone it was, as I hope you do believe, that You so hardly prevail'd with me to appear there at this Assizes. For tho' I was well satisfied, that the Work you invited me to, was a Work that ought to be
done by some body; yet could I not think every one fit for so great a Task, and least of all such an one as I, whom long Privacy and Retirement has in a great mea∣sure unfitted for any Publick Employment; and especially at such a time as this, when the Distempers of Men are come to that height, that something more than ordinary should be found in that Man, who can hope that any thing which he can offer in order to a Cure, may prove either acceptable or effectual.
But being no longer able to resist the Importunities you were pleas'd to use with me, and having first humbly applied myself to Almighty God for his Direction and Assistance; after some serious Thoughts, what Subject might be most proper for a Discourse in so Great and Honourable an Assembly; considering both the little Fear of God which most Men seem to have before their eyes, and the uneasiness of many under so good a Govern∣ment as God hath now blessed us with, and their fre∣quent Murmurings at our present Condition, by much too good for us; I could not think of any thing more suitable to our present state, than what is recommended to us in those Words of Solomon, which I have made choice of.
How well I have performed, what (at your Request, Sir) I undertook, I must necessarily leave it to every one to judge as he shall see cause; and what the success will be. He only knows whose infinite Power over-rules the perverse Wills and unruly Affections of Men, and who after the planting of a Paul, and watering of an A∣pollos, must give the increase, or all that's done by Man is as good as nothing I can (I thank God) com∣fort myself in this Testimony of my Conscience, That I have here deliver'd nothing, which I am not verily per∣swaded
is agreeable to the Will of God, and both seasona∣ble and necessary to be taken notice of and conscientiously practised by us: and that my whole Design is only this, to perswade Men to the earnest pursuit of their own and their Country's Happiness, by leading quiet and peace∣able Lives, in all godliness and honesty, under the pre∣sent Government. And I hope no Man can find a reason why he should be angry with me for this.
Having thus done what I was able, in compliance with your desire, Sir, to serve God, our most gracious Princes whom his Goodness hath set over us, and my Country, seeing your bodily Indisposition would not allow you to be my Auditor, I could not reasonably deny you, requesting it, a Copy of my Sermon; but finding it to be in order to a Publication, I was at a stand, considering it could not be your own Judgment that moved you to it, you having at that time neither heard nor seen it. But when you told me it was the desire of those worthy Gen∣tlemen who were present; and when both the Worship∣ful Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, and the Mayor and Aldermen of the Corporation of Nottingham had conde∣scended to desire it of me: and when that Honourable Judge the Lord Chief Justice Pollexfen had not only en∣couraged me by his Publick Approbation of what had in his Presence been delivered, but understanding that I had for hast omitted something of what I had prepared, was pleas'd to say, I should do well to publish it entirely as I had prepared it; I had no Power to refuse so general an Invitation, which it could no longer be called Modesty, but a most unreasonable as well as unmannerly and sullen Obstinacy to disobey.

 To You therefore, Sir, and to all those worthy Gen∣tlemen who were pleas'd to join with you in this Request, (which I ought to look upon as a Command) I do in all due humility and respect, present these my poor endeavours for the Glory of God, and the Publick Good: not doubting but your constant and exemplary Practice of those unque∣stionable Duties which are therein, howsoever recommend∣ed to you, will make them much more serviceable to those great Ends, than otherwise they are like to be Neither shall I need to fear or regard the Censures this plain Dis∣course may meet with from any others, so long as I have not only the Conscience of a most honest Design, but also the Judgments and Patronage of so many Judicious Persons, testified in their daily Exercise of both Piety and Loyalty, even of all that I have here exhorted to, to guard me from them.
That our blessed God may give us all Hearts so re∣gardful of, and thankful for the great and wonderful Works which he hath wrought for us, as that the sence of his undeserved Goodness therein manifested to us, may be an everlasting Obligation upon us to his Fear, and the keeping of all his Commandments always, that so it may be well with us, and with our Children for ever: That we may all have Grace seriously and effectually to con∣sider the things that belong unto our Peace, before they be hid from our eyes: That we may no longer de∣sperately expose ourselves, either to the Wrath of God by our Wickedness, or to the Malice and Scorn of our Enemies by our Discontents, Divisions, and mutual A∣nimosities. Lastly, That God may bless You, Sir, and all the Gentlemen of the Magistracy with Courage and Fidelity in your Honourable Stations, and make you
Illustrious Examples of all Vertue and Goodness to your whole Country, and finally reward you with the Crown of Righteousness, is, and shall be the hearty Prayer of,
SIR,
