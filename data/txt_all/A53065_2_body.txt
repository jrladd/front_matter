Noble Sir,
ALthough I'me absented from your person, yet not from your Favours, they are too great, and certainly not to be worn out either by distance of Time or Place; and you are so excel∣lent and Divine an Architecture, that your Generosity never missed the true Measure of Mi∣sery, and may our payment of Praiers be justly retur∣ned you, in Blessings from Heaven; and as your Bounty runns a Race with Necessity, so may your Merit win the Bell of Fame; which Bell I wish may sound in e∣very Ear, and as long as there be Ears to hear,

So that your Name may live still in Report,
When that your Soul is gone to Heavens Court.

Sir,
