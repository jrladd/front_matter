SVch Newyeres giftes as most meÌ„ do prepare
To geue your grace, it passeth far my powre.
For golde ne pearle, ne such lyke costly ware,
Can I possesse: sith fortune styll doth lowre.


As she on me hath hereto euer done,
Which had me brought at length to great distresse
But that the hope, which in your grace alone
I alwayes fixt: my griefes did oft redresse.


Which hope I say, euen now doth make me bolde
Your royall state, with this so small a queyre
For to present: yea more, that hope me tolde,
From this day forth, I should no more dispeire.
For loe, (saith she) the golden worlde at hande,
And Iustice raignes again within this lande.
