Honoured Sir,
SEpius mernini ipse perpendi: I have often involved in my Minde

the Worthiness of the Famous AUSONIAN PRINCES in their pro∣motion of ARTS and LEARNING, by their Favourable As∣pects, in Candidly ac∣cepting the Dedications of generally all AU∣THORS and STU∣DENTS in Liberal SCIENCES; which is no small Encourage∣ment unto them. Sel∣dome do we see the

Title of a Germane DEDICATION, but it is directed, Ali∣quo serenissimo Principi, &c.
And this, Sir, I hope will be a sufficient Ad∣vocate for me, to pre∣sent this small Piece to your VVorthy Patro∣nage; and I am encou∣raged thereunto, through my sensibility Gene∣rositatis, Benignitatis∣que tuis nostratibus:

You remain the standing-Pillar of your Noble Family, and the Ho∣nour of your Country; for which you have your Neighbours Prayers and Praise: and for my part, my Mite is small: Hanc igitur meae, in te, habeas qualemcún∣que sit gratitudinis, & observantiae Testimoni∣um.
Sir, This is a Piece of Hermetical Philoso∣phy,

which is well seasoned with Salt, and I doubt not will at least help you away with the tediousness of some vacant Hours: 'tis a Translation; and if I have erred in Gram∣mar, I submit to your Censure: beseeching the ALL-Eternal to endow you and yours with all Felicity, inter∣nal, external, and e∣ternal; for which I am your dayly Ora∣tor,

as I am Reve∣ra,
LONDON, 22 Decemb. 1656.
