I cannot but esteem it a great part of my good Fortune to have been made the happy Instrument of preserving so Holy and Sacred a Treasure, as the Crucifix and Gold-Chain of St. Edward the Confessor seem to be: And the having an Opportunity of lay∣ing

them at your Majesties feet. And whereas your Majesty was then pleased to accept the same with some kind of satisfaction, so I humbly beseech your most Sacred Majesty to pardon this presumption of giving your Majesty the trouble of a further account of that Action, then at that present I could recollect or call to mind, and that the Memory thereof may not be lost to Poste∣rity; which is the humble request of,
