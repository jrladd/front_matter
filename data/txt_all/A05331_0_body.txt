LO heere the first fruits, or rather the tender buddes and blossomes of my la∣bours. Which least in this their winterly sprouting they might perhaps by some bitter blasts of censure be frost-nipped, I humbly recommend to your Honora∣ble protection.
Most due they are onely to your selfe, being for the greatest part nothing else, but a large illustration of certaine southern voiages of the English, alreadie dedicated to your Honour. And at this time especially I thought they would prooue the more acceptable: in that the Marocan am∣bassadour (whose Kings dominions are heere most amplie and particularly described) hath so lately treated with your Honour concerning matters of that estate.
Vouchsafe therefore (right Honorable) according to your accustomed humanitie towards learning, to accept of this Geo∣graphicall historie, in like manner as it pleased your Honour not long since most fauourablie to take in good part those com∣mendable indeuours of my reuerend friend M. Richard Hakluyt: who out of his mature iudgement in these studies, knowing the excellencie of this storie aboue all others in the same kinde, was the onely man that mooued me to translate it. At London this three and fortieth most ioifull Coronation-day of her sacred Maiestie. 1600.
