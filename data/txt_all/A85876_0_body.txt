MADAM,
THough other Cards passe here, and there
Vnder the name of Nicholas Benier'e;
And his Protections good, (unlesse it be
From the Excise-man, or Monopoly.)
These cannot so: A Grand Commission sits,
And every one's Exciser of our Wits:
Wherefore these Guardlesse Fancies humbly fly
Into your Hands, for sweet security.
All in one Suite, that you would Deale them out,
And happily they then may go About.
Who will not say in ordinary kindnesse,
(Deliver'd by Such Hands,) they're Cartes Fines.
They may perchance the happy fortune get
Of some New Fashion, where the Ladies met,
And my good Ladies Dresse being lik'd and New,
All their good Ladiships to like it drew.
So may they Draw, when you doe once begin,
At least for your Sake say, Give't me agen.
