Friend,
THe Heroique Disease of Wri∣ting hath (as you well know) long since seized on me, this being the Fifth Publique Pa∣roxisme I have had thereof. It hath been ever the humour of my Genius to put me upon untrodden Pathes, and to make up aggre∣gate Bodies of very scarce and wide disper∣sed Notions; which had been more easie for the Faculty of my weak Body, had I had a Signality of Spirit to summon De∣mocriticall Atomes to conglobate into an intellectuall Forme; or, that Mercury had been so propitious a Lord of the Ascen∣dent in my Nativity, as he was in Amphi∣on's, and bestowed some Orpharion upon me, with whose sound I might have attra∣cted

Notions, and made them come dan∣cing to the Construction of a Book What I here present you with, is an Enditement fra∣med against most of the Nations under the Sun; whereby they are arraigned at the Tribunall of Nature, as guilty of High-treason, in Abasing, Counterfeiting, Defa∣cing, and Clipping her Coine, instampt with her Image and Superscription on the Body of Man. The matter of Fact is proved by sufficient Witnesses of credible Historians, that it will not be an easie thing for them to traverse the Inditement. The Prosecution of such an Action, wherein the honour and reputation of the great Architect, man's Protoplastes, is so much concern'd, had been (I humbly confess) more fit for one who had deserved to be Atturney Ge∣nerall to Nature, then for me, the meanest Solicitor in her Court. When you have well viewed the Scenes and Devillish shapes of this Practicall Metamorphosis, and scan'd them in your serious thoughts, you will wonder at their audacious phant'sies, who seeme to hold Specificall deformities, or that any part can seeme unhandsome in

their Eyes, which hath appeared good and beautifull unto their Maker: And I doubt not but you will soone discerne the pro∣pense malice of Satan in it, tempting man∣kind to a corporall Apostacy from himself: as if in an Apish despight of the glory of mans Creation, that divine consultation, Eaciamus hominem, Let us make man accor∣ding to our Image; He would have his Defaciamus hominem, Let us deface man ac∣cording to our likenesse; insomuch as that of the Psalmist, I am fearfully and wonderful∣ly made, might be ironically applyed to man in this his abusive Transformation. Besides what in the Inditement I have charged upon the score of mans pragmaticall invention, (which is the maine Designe) upon strict Disquisition after the causes and original of these Monstrosities, which I had rather call Native then Naturall; I lay them to the charge of man, discharging Nature from having any hand, or the least intention ther∣in. And concerning National Monstrosities, I account it a high slander raised against the Honesty of Nature, that she should be delighted to disport her selfe with such An∣tick

varieties of formes as appeare in the world, or should sometimes set her selfe to mock any Person, much lesse whole Nati∣ons, out of their right shape and feature; so that you will clearely see here, as in the mirrour of Alitophilus, the true causes and effects of all the Artificiall Retortions, Na∣tive Alienations, and Absurd Transfigurati∣ons of the Humane forme. Why I dedicate this to you, is not solemnly to engage you to a Polemicall Defence of it; but only, if need be, to witnesse my good intention and zeale to Nature (whether it be accor∣ding to knowledge, let others judge) and that this may remaine as a Pledge of our contracted Friendship and Amity; and that Posterity and Future Ages may know in the Religion thereof,
