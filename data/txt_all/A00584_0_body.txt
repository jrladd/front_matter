SIR,
A Godly liberality is not much different from a frugall prouidence; 'tis but a letter of Returne, by which we shall re∣ceiue in heauen what we haue wisely laid out on earth: for hee that hath pitie on the poore, lendeth vnto the Lord; and looke what hee layeth out, it shall be payed him againe, Prou. 19. 17. So that the practise of this piety, is the most aduantagious vsury: for we lend but temporals, but we shall re∣ceiue both the Principall and Interest in

Eternals. Happy might all Gods tempo∣rall Stewards be, if they would so imploy their golden Talent. Concerning your owne particular, I will onely thus much say, The prayers of the poore for you will sooner present your charity to God, then the prayses of my Pen can vnto the World. And as for the no meane appre∣hension of your fauour and good mea∣ning towards my selfe, I can returne no o∣ther, saue the poore mans tribute, prayers and thankes: of which this slender Pre∣sent, the thinne gleanings of a Country Labourer, is a faithfull, though vnpro∣portioned testimony. Which if you but as kindly accept, as it is freely offered, you shall accipiendo dare, be bounteous in recei∣uing, and so deserue new thankes abun∣dantly gratifying him, who alwaies vnfai∣nedly desires
