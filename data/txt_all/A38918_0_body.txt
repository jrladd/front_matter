MY LORD,
SINCE it hath pleased GOD once more in mercy to remember this poor Nation; for discovering to it those un∣heard of Villanies and unparallelled Wickedness that were contriving against its Peace and Religion; I thought it my Duty to let my Countrey have a Taste of the Nature of that subtil Enemy she hath to deal withal, who envieth her Priviledges and Happiness; and your Lordship appearing to stand by the Evidence with all Candor becoming a Person of your Worth and Dignity, in order to a full Detection of the Frauds and Designs of these Vermine, I thought it my Duty to pray your Patronage and Protection of this little Treatise which I now publish. I have nothing, my
Lord, to plead for me, but only the Innocency of my Intention, and question not but your Lordship will appear, as you have ever done, to oppose this growing Interest. And truly (my Lord) this Nation hath reason to bless the Most High God for your Care for her Peace and Establishment in the Profession of that Religion; which doth oblige all Subjects to all Loyalty to their Prince, and to live in Peace and Love one with another. This Treatise spake formerly the Italian Tongue, but now it is made to speak English; and in it I find such an Account of the Nations Adversaries, which to my own knowledge they deserve. If it be faulty, it is because it is somewhat too short of them. Now (my Lord) I humbly conceive your Lordship will pardon that, because it was all the Author (who was of the Romish Religion) could say at that time when he first publisht it. This I hope your Honour will ac∣cept of thus presented, as I found it, without the least Alteration. I shall submit all to your Lordships Candor; therefore heartily praying for your Lordships Prosperity, I humbly take leave to subscribe my Self,
28 Febr. 1678/9.
