THIS small labour, to which as well your love to me, and to the truths herein contain∣ed, as my great engage∣ments and no less affecti∣ons to you, have long since entituled you, doth humbly put it self into your hands, and craves the accep∣tance of that which is so many wayes your own. If I were capable of making any other returns to you for your favours; Yet (since they would be all so inconside∣rable) I could not pardon my self so great an injustice, as the not presenting you with this would seem to be: but seeing I de∣spair of doing any thing else, I could not justly expect to find a pardon from you, if I had denyed you this poor acknowledgement.
It is true indeed, that you expect neither this nor any other requital of your kind∣nesses;
but all my services are the more due to you because you, expect none at all.
I have detained you so long in some former addresses, that I shall be the short∣er in this: and only acquaint you, that this Treatise was intended for a remedy of those evils under under which we in these Kingdoms long groaned: but now by rea∣son that our deliverance from our oppres∣sions was so speedy, and its delivery from the press so slow, it must serve as a pre∣servative from the like mischiefs in time to come. I know it shall not want your prayers to assist it in the effecting of its design; which is the advancement of un∣feigned and impartial godliness in the hearts of those that read it. This only can make his Majesty glorious, and his Kingdoms happy, (both which I know none can wish more heartily then your selves) This should imploy all our thoughts, and engage all our endeavours, and be the sum of all our prayers; And to the promoting of this I hope that I shall alwayes bend all my studies, and therein approve my self to you above all others,
