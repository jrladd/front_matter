RIGHT Ho∣nourable,
It vvas my good happe not longe since, in a

Friends House, to light vpon a briefe History of the Life, Arraignement, and Death of that Mir∣rour of all true Honour, and Vertue Syr Thomas More, vvho by his Wis∣dome, Learning, & San∣tity, hath eternized his Name, Coūtrey, & Pro∣fession, throughout the Christian World, vvith immortall Glory, and Renovvne.
Finding, by perusall

therof, the same repleni∣shed vvith incōparable Treasures, of no lesse Worthy, and most Chri∣stiā Factes, then of Wise, & Religious Sentences, Apophthegmes, & Say∣ings; I deemed it not only an errour to permit so great a light to ly bu∣ried, as it vvere, vvithin the vvalls of one priuate Family: but also iudged it vvorthy the Presse, euē of a golden Character (if

it vvere to be had) to the end, the vvhole World might receaue comfort and profit by reading the same.
Hauing made this Re∣solution, a Difficultie presented it selfe to my Thoughts, vnder vvhose Shaddovv, or Patronage I might best shelter the Worke: vnto vvch strife, Your LADISHIP, occurring to my cogita∣tions, put an end, vvith

he BEAMS of your VORTH, & HO∣NOVR; so dazeling my yes, as I could discerne one other more , or VVorthy to imbrace, &c rotect so Glorious and Memorable Examples.
Of vvhose GOOD∣NES I am so confidēt, at vvithout further de∣te, iudge, this Enter∣ange of Friendshippe ay vvorthily be made etvveene the SAINT

and YOU. YOU (Ma∣dame) shal Patronize his HONOVR heere on Earth; and HE, shall be∣come a Patrone, and In∣tercessour for YOU in Heauen.
