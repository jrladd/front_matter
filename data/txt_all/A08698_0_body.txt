RIght Worshipfull, you may iustly thinke I am very bold, be∣ing in respect a stranger vnto you, to offer vp these lines to your fauorable censure, yet the loue & good affection which I owe to your worship for some sufficient causes: may fully excuse my rashnes in that behalfe: and considering withall your gen∣tle disposition, hoping you will take in good part this meane gift, not respecting the value therof but the good will of the giuer, as did that woorthy King accepting with gentle hart a draught of water of a simple hind, so I expecting you will curteously vouchsafe the patro∣nizing of these simple collexions, although there be nothing woorthy your reviewing contained therein, yet if you grant it but the rea∣ding, you may finde some matter which may eyther delight you, by bringing into your remembrance such memorable & worthy things as haue hapned in former ages, or driue other drousie thoughts out of your mind: which if it so come to passe, I shall haue the ful scope of my desires, and be the more bolde an other time to offer to your view some thing of better worth. And so I leaue you to the merci∣full protection of Almighty God, whom I beseech to blesse you with increase of worship, long life, and eternall happines.
