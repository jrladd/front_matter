Dear friends:
IT hath been the universall con∣dition
of the Earth (Mankinde)
to be overspread with a black
Cloud of darknesse; and the
knowledge of the King of righte∣ousnesse
hath been manifested
but in some few scattered ones,
which as they haue had the
spring in themselves, so they have been as lights in the
dark world, and others have walked in their light,
and rested content to drink of their streams, as if
their declaration of truth had been the very Fountain
it self.
I my self have known nothing but what I received
by tradition from the mouths and pen of others: I
worshipped a God, but I neither knew who he was, nor
where he was, so that I lived in the dark, being blind∣ed
by the imagination of my flesh, and by the imagina∣tion
of such as stand up to teach the people to know the
Lord, and yet have no knowledge of the Lord them∣selves,
but as they have received by hearsay, from
their books, and other mens words.
I spoke of the name of God, and Lord, and Christ,
but I knew not this Lord, God, and Christ; I prayed
to a God, but I knew not where he was, nor what he

was, and so walking by imagination, I worshipped
that devill, and called him God; by reason whereof
my comforts were often shaken to pieces, and at last it
was shewed to me, That while I builded upon any
words or writings of other men, or while I looked af∣ter
a God without me, I did but build upon the sand,
and as yet I knew not the Rock.
And now know friends, That this ignorant, unsettled
condition is yours at this time, though I know, that
the proud King flesh that is in you, will be ready to
speak within you, and tell you, that you do know God,
and Christ, and be offended with me, because I say you
know him not. I do not write any thing, as to be a
teacher of you, for I know you have a teacher within
your selves (which is the Spirit) and when your esh
is made subject to him, he will teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance, so that you
shall not need to run after men for instruction, for
your eyes being opened; you shall see the King of righ∣teousnesse
sit upon the throne within your selves,
judging and condemning the unrighteousnesse of the
flesh, filling your face with shame, and your soul with
horror, though no man see, or be acquainted with
your actions, or thoughts but your selves, and justify∣ing
your righteous thoughts and actions, and lead you
into all wayes of truth.
And this is the Spirit, or Father, which as he
made the Globe, and every creature, so he dwels in
every creature, but supreamly in Man; and he it is
by whom every one lives, and moves, and hath his
being; perfect man is the eye and face, that sees and
declares the Father, and he is perfect when he is ta∣ken
up into this spirit, and lives in the light of reason;
and there is no man or woman can say that the Fa∣ther
doth not dwell in him, for he is every where;

there is no a creature in the compasse of the creation,
but he is in that creature, but disobedient man knows
him not, and why? Because flesh is not subject to
the spirit within it; his covetous flesh hath deceived
him, for he either looks abroad for a God, and so doth
imagine and fancie a God to be in some particular
place of glory, beyond the skies, or some where he
knows not, or in some place of glory that cannot be
known till the body be laid in the dust.
Or else if men do look for a God within them, ac∣cording
as the Record speaks, God is within you;
yet they are led by the motions and commands of
King flesh within them, and not by King spirit; and
here they are at a losse, not being able to distinguish
between flesh and spirit, by reason that covetousnesse
and self-will blindes their eyes. Truly friends, King
flesh is very covetous, self-loving, and self-honouring;
it likes them that say as it saith, but it would impri∣son,
kill, and hang every one that differs from him;
he is full of heart-burning, either of open envy, and
bitter distemper, or else carries himself in a smooth,
quiet way of hypocrisie, walking in a shew of truth,
like an Angell of light, but when he gets an opportune
power, he turns to be a tyrant, against the way of the
spirit.
And so all his love was but for by-ends, to satisfie
self in some particular or other: But now the King
of righteousnesse within you, is a meek, patient, and
quiet spirit, and full of love and sincerity, he burns
up the proud and hasty flesh, he loves truth, and
hates a lie; if the creature acts unrighteously, he
checks and shames him, if he act righteously (accord∣ing
to the creation of a man) he speaks peace within,
and so makes the man to walk sincerely, and warily.
And when you come to know, feel, and see that the

spirit of righteousness governs your flesh, then you be∣gin
to know your God, to fear your God, to love your
God, and to walk humbly before your God, and so to
rejoyce in him; and therefore if you would have the
peace of God (as you call it) you must know what
God it is you serve, which is not a God without you,
visible among bodies, but the spirit within you, invi∣sible
in every body to the eye of flesh, yet discernable to
the eye of the spirit; and when souls are made to
have community with that spirit, then they have
peace, and not till then.
For this let me tell you, that if you subject your
flesh to this mighty governour, the spirit of righte∣ousness
within your selves, he will bring you into
community with the whole Globe, so that in time you
shall come to know as you are known, and you shall
not need to run after others, to learn of them what
God is, for as you are a perfect creation, every one of
himself; so you shall see, and feel that this spirit is
the great governour in you, in righteousness; and
when you come thus to know the truth, the truth shall
make you free from the bondage of covetous, and
proud flesh, the Serpent that held you under slavery
all your life time. Well, as darkness hath overspread
the Earth (Mankinde) so now is the time come,
that knowledge shall abound, and cover the earth
(Mankinde) light begins to arise, the spirit
begins to appear in flesh, he spreads himself in his
sons and daughters, so that as the Sun shines from
East to West, so shall the appearing of this Son of
righteousness he; he comes not now in corners, but
openly; the poor receive the Gospel, (which is this
everlasting spirit) wise men in the flesh are made
fools, fools are made wise, scholars are declared to
be ignorant, the ignorant ones in mens learning, be∣come

abundantly learned in the experimentall know∣ledge
of Christ.
I do not write to teach, I only declare what I know,
you may teach me, for you have the fountain of life in
you as well as I, and therefore he is called the Lord,
because he rules not in one, but in everyone through the
globe, and so we being many, are knit together into one
body, & are to be made all of one heart, and one minde,
by that one spirit that enlightens every man. I have
yeelded to let these few experiences come abroad,
and partly unwilling, because I see more clearly into
these secrets then before I writ them, which teaches
me to rejoyce in silence, to see the Father so abun∣dantly
at work; and it shall cease speedily for men
to stand up as they do to teach one another, for eve∣ry
one shall be taught of him, and I shall be as ready
to hear as to speak, and to give as to receive, and e∣very
one delighting to do as they would be done unto.
This is the King of righteousness that shall raign
in the earth, this is the spirit that is now pouring out
upon sons and daughters; though it yet seem small,
it shall speedily increase, and the Father will not de∣spise
that day of small things; proud flesh shall die,
and raign King and governour in man no longer:
they that have understanding know what I say, o∣thers
may reproach, and be offended, but after they
have been tryed in the fire, which is the spirit, they
will acknowledge a truth herein, and he made to
speak as a friend to truth.
