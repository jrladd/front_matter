Dearely Beloved,
THough the Title-page informs you for whose sake I was especi∣ally induced to write this small Treatise; it was neuer inten∣ded by me, that any party of you should wholly monopolize my thoughts of love and Christian respect; but howsoever my duty presseth me more, in reference to the charge I daily undergoe, then to thrust my Sickle into anothers Harvest:
Yet since this comes on the publique Theatre, you may all challenge as well a share in it, as the Author whom all of you may justly claime (though in different relations peradventure) to be your owne. Concerning the Booke it selfe, it behoves me not to say much; To dispraise it beyond my owne judg∣ment, were sinfull modesty; to praise it above desert, unsufferable arrogan∣cy. Medio tutissimus, &c. The best course is to leave it to your Christian perusall, and charitable survay; and so I doe; telling you onely, that no∣thing, save the weaknesse is mine owne. For the main substance (though the most of it came immediately out of my memory in this forme you see it, without any considerable consulting of Authors) was of that store, which in reading the Scripture, and other Di∣vinity Bookes, and hearing Sermons, conferences, &c. I had before treasu∣red up. Some things indeed there be, which you shall hardly meet with in
any VVorke yet extant; but those I also disclaime as none of mine: For so farre as the truth of GOD appea∣reth in them, the spirit of God, the guide to, and in all saving truth (in whose hand I am at the best but an In∣strument) may justly appropriate it to himselfe, as his right and due. Though sometimes I am forced to clash with unsound opinions, I haue concealed the Authors Names, as having a desire to vindicate the truth, not to provoke a∣ny to vindicate himself: for which cause I have not onely declined all bitter∣nesse of expression (which I think be∣low a Christian at all times) but also the recitall of their owne words formal∣ly (contenting my selfe with the mat∣ter) least it should too plainely appeare who owneth the Tenets I oppose. If notwithstanding all this, any be dispo∣sed to wrangle with me, I shall hardly trouble the VVorld, or my selfe so far, as to rejoyne to such replyes: But if I be reasoned with in the spirit of meek∣nesse,
whether it be in this publique way, or any other, I dare with a safe conscience (and shall be ready as my occasions will permit) to give an ac∣count, in a brotherly way, to any that shall desire satisfaction, concerning a∣ny thing herein asserted: Thus I com∣met both you, and this small piece to the blessing of GOD, remaining,

Strethill, Aprill, the 9. 1649
