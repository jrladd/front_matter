MADAME,
I Present vnto you these my weake and homely labours, being the first fruits of my paines in this kinde, humbly desi∣ring that your Ladiship wold vouch∣safe to patronize them. That which hath emboldened me to dedicate them to your worthy Name, is Partly
A minde willing in the best mea∣sure I can, to testifie my thankeful∣nesse for your many vndeserued fauours, whereby I confesse you may iustly challenge more then my Mediocrity can euer performe: Partly, your loue vnfeigned, and sincere profession of the Gospell, (whereby you are an honour to your Degree and Sexe) cleerely eui∣denced many wayes, during your abode in Suffolke: which, as it is a sweete testimony to your owne breast, that you are beloued of God, and hath made you farre and neere honoured by all such which loue God: so also it hath made mee very confident, that your Ladiship will fauourably ac∣cept these my thankefull ende∣uours. Goe on I humbly beseech you (good Madame) goe on in that good way which you haue chosen: and constantly continue, as a bright
Starre, to shine (without waning, or being ecclipsed) to the directing, confirming, and comforting of many, as hitherto you haue done. And, for my part, I shall neuer cease (among many other) to stand vp as an humble Suppliant to God; that you may bee more and more strengthened in his Grace, and di∣rected by the Eternall Spirit, that as you haue already, by your zeale in Religion, prouoked many: so you may perseuere vnto the end, in this holy course, and bring on, and encourage others by your sin∣gular example: Then shall your Name bee still more honourable while you liue here, and your ac∣count furthered in the day of our Lord IESVS. And thus humbly tendering my best seruice to your Ladiship, and to the hopefull Gen∣tleman Mr FREDERICKE, your ioy, (vpon whom I beseech God
to double the glory of all his An∣cestors) and wishing vnto you both, and to your whole fami∣ly, all temporall and eternall blessings by Iesus Christ: I humbly take my leaue, and alway rest,
