Madam,
THough Virtue, Honour, and all the other Accomplishments of the Mind, are not to be reflected on with the least grain of Ostentation, by those, that the Heavens have en∣dowed with such eminent Quallities: Yet certainly, Madam, those three Illustrious Persons, represented in this small piece, which I Humbly offer you, would have thought themselves particularly obliged to

kind Heaven, if it had produc'd in their time, so exact a Pattern o their own Perfections, as you are Madam; in which without the least scruple or offence to Modesty, they might have admired, with as much Justice as Delight those Accomplish∣ments, which did so visibly mark in their own Persons so great a diffe∣rence from the rest of the World. Yes Madam, in you they might have lov'd the rare Qualities which were so consonant to those which adorn'd themselves, and which modesty would not permit them to applaude in their own Persons.
Is it not therefore, with great Justice, Madam, that I have sheltered this little, but true piece of History, under your safe protection. You who has so great a share in it; you Ma∣dam,

in whom all the glittering Ca∣racters of Persons, as great in their Perfections of Minds, as they were in their Births, do so greatly abound, you, Madam, who has so just a discern∣ment in all that is excellently good, who has so nice a Judgment in the Criticism's of your own Dialect, and who is so great a Judge of our's. Finally, you, Madam, who can best Judge of the equity with which I have proceeded, in presenting to our Eng∣lish World, the true and lively Ca∣racters of three Persons so remark∣able.
But, Madam, that you may not be inticed in your turn into some agre∣able rapture, by too long a contemplati∣on these Excellent Persons Merits, give me leave to draw the Curtain over it, and to divert you with a

pretty piece of Turkish gallantry, in which you way behold a certain way of Courtship, as pleasant, as new to us Europeans; I am sensible, Madam, it were but reasonable, I should give you some more particular accounts of these two Novels, but that having been done already, sufficiently by the French Author, I shall desist there∣fore from giving you any further diversion, from your more serious re∣flections, and shall only take the Liberty of subscribing my self,
Madam,
