OF all we admire in these times there
is nothing comparable to the for∣tune
of the Ottomans, and the in∣crease
of their greatnesse; if we ex∣amine
their beginning and meanes,
for they are by nation Tartarians,
sprung from the most base and re∣mote
parts of Asia, in former times
as vnknowen as vnworthy: If we
consider their conditions, they bewray no feeling of ciuili∣ty
or curtesie: If we regard the parts of their minde, where
shall we see ought more rude, and rough hewen then the
spirit of that people? What haue beene the souldiours
they haue had through whose valor they haue aduantaged
themselues by so many memorable victories? No better
then slaues haled in their infancy from the breasts and laps
of their mothers, children of tribute tythed euery yeere
from amongst the miserable Christians ouer whom they
command and domineere. Yet we see that with these fee∣ble
meanes they haue, in lesse then three hundred yeeres,
conquered Asia as far as Tigris, and the Gulfe of Persia,
possest themselues of Aegypt, Numidia, and all the red sea.
More, hauing atchieued these glorious cōquests they haue
beene seene to march, as they say, with colours flying tho∣row
Europe, to ouerrun large countries, seaze themselues

of kingdomes and most puissant Estates, finally to become
Monarches of Greece, and to haue caried the Empire of
Constantinople; whose neighbours haue not bene exempt
from the hauocke of their forces, so many armies ouer∣throwen,
so many Princes ruined, so many rich cities and
townes sackt and rased. Their power, ouerflowing in hap∣pinesse,
is at this day the scourge of the East and the terror
of the West: In sum, they are feareful to the whole world.
But the greater is the astonishment, when we consider, that
naked and vnarmed, they haue marched victorious ouer
the bellies of the most warlicke nations vnder the heauens,
the best prouided of forces and all munition necessary for
the wars, that such a people as they vnskilled in nauigation
should become masters almost of all the seas. Many haue
gone about to search out the cause of this thriuing great∣nesse,
and I amongst others haue for my part with no small
diligence perused such authors as haue written their histo∣ry;
but when I haue narrowly sifted all they haue said of
that matter, I finde not this my honest appetite and curio∣sity
as I would contented; rather as one ill satisfied with
the diuersity and negligence of their Historiographers, all
of them nothing neere approching the course and know∣ledge
of the first and essentiall cause of this their so raised
fortunes, I haue sought to please my selfe with setting down
as I haue, the many acts and obseruations I haue thereof
collected, and which well deserue to be published: not
that I so far forget my selfe as to thinke my selfe able to flie
a higher pitch then others whom I much honour and e∣steeme;
but because I haue taken cleane an other way; with
this hope neuerthelesse, that huely representing and distin∣guishing
by order as I doe, the establishment of this Mo∣narchy
(answerable to what may be vnderstoode there∣of)
the apparence and truth of my discourse wil somwhat
inlighten this subiect & affoord me an honest excuse vp∣on
the defects which may be discouered in my opinion.
The argument then of this book consisteth of three points,

whereunto the order of the whole discourse hath refe∣rence:
In the first place I summarily handle the meanes
they haue practised for their aduancement and greatnesse;
secondly with what cunning and deceit they maintaine
what they haue gotten: and lastly how we may be able to
assaile them, and turne the chance of their victories and
powers. This my trauaile (most mighty Prince) taketh
his flight straight to your Highnesse to range it selfe vnder
the shelter of your protection, armed with the allowable
opinion, that your Aighnesse as a generous Prince cannot
but take especiall pleasure to heare, see, & waigh such spe∣culations.
To say the truth, the ordinary discourses of
your Highnesse table are no other but sundry questions,
which it pleaseth your Highnesse vsually to propound to
all those noble spirits that attend you; but aboue all, when
any one awaketh matter cōcerning either Estate affaires, or
the atchieuement of deedes of armes; then is the time your
Highnesse lendeth an attentiue eare to such as discourse
thereof, and to all mens admiration resolueth the most dif∣ficult
points of the matter in handling, wherein you disco∣uer
a iudgment so far beyonde the vulgar and surpassing
your age, as we cannot but confesse that the propositions
you make are so many proofes and resolutions which you
deliuer, and please to draw from out the capacity of your
seruants. Which considering often with my selfe, I finde
forthwith allaied in me the heat of the intention I had to
dedicate this my booke to your Highnesse, but at the same
instant finding represented before mine eies; the excellen∣cy
of your iudgment, together with your noble and gentle
disposition, which knoweth how to accommodate your
greatnesse to the honest designes of your subiects, such
especially as reuerence you like me, feare immediatly va∣nisheth
and my desire gathereth strength, with assurance
that you wil be so gratious, as, though I be the least of your
seruants, you will not spare to entertaine and honour this
my little labour with your iudgment: practising vpon me

what the Sunne (common father of generation) doth on
the earth, bestowing his beames indifferently as well vpon
the low plants as high trees. It may please your highnesse
then to vouchsafe to receiue this treatise with the like coū∣tenance
as you would ought else especially labored, in i∣mitation
of the diuine Maiesty (only Idea of all perfecti∣on)
which as well excepteth the offering of the poore
widow, as the presents of great Princes. Againe, it may
please your highnes not to thinke amisse so farforth to pro∣tect
the whole discourse, that it may, supported by your
authority, passe with that credit as I wish among men, and
remaine free from the many censures of such as take no o∣ther
delight then in reprehending other mens inuentions.
This assurance will make me lift my head higher then o∣therwise
I would, for two causes: The one for the honour
and particular contentment I shall receiue hauing per∣formed
ought pleasing to your Highnesse, the other
for the testimony I shall heereby haue of the
participation of your fauour beyond
my merit and expectation: for
which I offer vp my selfe
not to die vngrate∣full,
