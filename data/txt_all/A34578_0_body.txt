DEAR SISTER,
HAD I not when I first undertook this
Poem promis'd my self a better suc∣cess
from the Attempt, then I find
upon a review of it now it is done, it had
never been design'd for you, who deserve
much better than the best endeavour of a
more happy Translator than I pretend to be:
But if I had before too good an opinion of
my self, I do yet retain such a respect for
you, as would defend your name from so mean
a Dedication as this; did I not find my self
oblig'd by a vain and imprudent promise to
present you what I might have foreseen would
at the best prove very unfit to kiss your hands,
who ever entertain your self with the best
things, and in that discover the best judgment
to choose them. However seeing I have made
you a promise of this Play, that I want the

Art or the Patience to mend it, and that
you are only to suffer a private injury, since
it is never to be made publick: let me beg of
you to accept it, with the same sweetness you
usually entertain the applications of other
your Friends and Servants, who admire and
love you: by which acceptance (besides the
honour and obligation you will multiply upon
me) you will do a great justice to your self, in
being favourable to a man, that (if he could
write equal to the best) would lay his labours
at your feet with the same humility, and affe∣ction,
that he now subscribes himself,
Dear Sister,

Beresford,
Nov. 7. 1665.
