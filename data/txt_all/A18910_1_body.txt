I Haue heere for thy
vse, drawn a Summe
of the Sacred-writ,
vsually caled BIBLE,
from the greek word
that in English is, BOOKE: be∣cause
it is the Book of al books;
with which Book, other books
compared, they are but blots
of mans braine, whereas this is
the Sacred-writ and wisedome
of ELOHIM, or, of that
ONE ESSENCE IN TRI∣NITIE.
That Holy-booke,
before the Incarnation of the
PROMISED SEED, was divi∣ded
into Lavve and Prophets:

but since the CHRIST assu∣med
our nature, & in the same
ascended to the right hand of
Majestie, from whence HE sent
downe the HOLY-GHOST to
fill all thinges, especially the
hearts of his APOSTLES, for
speaking & penning the minde
of IESVS: after that time (I say)
The Book of God was divided
into PROPHETS and APO∣STLES,
Iesus Christ himselfe
being the chiefe Corner-stone,
Ephes. 2. 20. The whole then
consisteth in these Books:


1 Genesis,
2 Exodus,
3 Leviticus,
4 Nombers,
5 Deuteronomie.
6 Iob: which for order of time might be placed
next Genesis: but here for order of Books.
7 Ioshua.
8 Iudges.
9 Ruth.
10 Sam. 1.
11 Sam. 2.
12 Kings, 1.
13 Kings, 2.
14 Chon. 1.
15 Chron. 2.
16 Ezra,
17 Nehemiah.
18 Hester.
19 Psalmes.
20 Proverbs.
21 Ecclesiastes.
22 Song of Songs.



23 Isaiah.
24 Icremiah.
25 Ezechiel.
26 Daniel.


27 Hoshea.
28 Ioel.
29 Amos.
30 Obadiah.
31 Ionah.
32 Micah.
33 Nahum.
34 Habakkuk.
35 Zephaniah.
36 Haggai.
37 Zechariah.
38 Malachi: The last Prophet of the olde Testa∣ment,
and the last book of the OLD COVE∣NANT.



Betweene this Malachi and
the NEVVE TESTAMENT,
haue (too inconsideratlie) bene
inserted, certaine PRIVATE
writings, called Apocrypha: an
Humaine Breath, betwixt the
Lips of the two Testamentes.
Malachi (in English, Messenger
or Angel) (prophecieth plainly,
(Chap. 3. 1. and 4. 5.) that IE∣HOVAH
will sende vnto the
Iewes a Messenger, even Elijah,
to prepare the way before the

MESSENGER OF COVE∣NANT,
viz. CHRIST. These
speaches of Malachi, (or last
ANGEL of the old Covenant)
are the very Face of the Newe
Testament or Covenant made
for Many. Matthew, he repor∣teth
the ANGEL from Hea∣uen,
Chapter 1. 20. bringing
newes of IESVS: and Chap. 2.
1. The Messenger of Covenant
is borne: and Chap. 3. IOHN
BAPTIST the PREPARER
of Christ his way, is introduced
in that worke. Mark begin∣neth
with the same: and Luke
(Chap. 1.) bringeth in the AN∣GEL
publishing the birth of
the Messenger appointed to
prepare the waye: as also pro∣claiming
the birth of the AN∣GEL
of the NEVVE COVE∣NANT,
for whome he was to
prepare the waye, calling this
IOHN, ELIAS: because hee

goeth before Christ in the SPI∣RIT
and POVVER of ELI∣AS,
or Eliiah. The Evangelist
Iohn in his 1. Chapter, bring∣eth
in the saving LIGHT Ie∣sus,
and the MAN SENT from
GOD, viz. Iohn. Thus the
last BREATH of the olde Te∣stament
in Malachi, & the first
BREATH of the Newe Testa∣ment
in the mouthes of the E∣VANGELISTS,
is all ONE
BREATH CANONICALL
from Heaven. They looke not
with Ianus, into two contra∣ry
Coastes: but Hand in hand
they joyne, kissing each other,
and both of them looking in∣to
the EAST, from whence
the Glorious DAY-STAR did
visit the Earth.
Who nowe dare hinder their
lips from meeting, by inserting
Vn-canonicall writs, a Darke-Cloude,
and Private (if not, a

stinking) Breath. The Iews that
kept the Canon, received them
not: As also, they were not writ¦ten
in Hebers sacred tongue: a
sufficient Brand, that they were
no Orackles from IEHOVAH
to Hebers People. Leaping thē
over them Logs, we come vnto
the Newe Testament, whose
Books be these:

1 Matthewe.
2 Mark.
3 Luke.
4 Iohn.
5 Acts of the Apostles.
6 Paul his Epistle to the
Romanes.
7 Corinthians▪ 1.
8 Corinthians, 2.
9 Galatians.
10 Ephesians.
11 Philippians.
12 Colossiaus.
13 Thessalonians, 1.
14 Thessalonians, 2.
15 Timothie. 1.
16 Timothie. 2.
17 Titus.
18 Philemon.
19 The Authour to
the Hebrewes.
20 The Epistle of
Iames.
21 Of Peter, 1.
22 Of Peter, 2.
23 Of Iohn, 1.
24 Of Iohn, 2.
25 Of Iohn, 3.
26 Iude.
27 Revel.

Exercise thy selfe in pervsing
the Bible, the whole of al these
several writs, and thereby thou
shalt easilie (God his Spirite as∣sisting

thee) discerne the true
Christ from False, the True
Church from the False: True
writ from False: and so conse∣quently,
all holy Trueth from
Falshood. And for helping thy
weake Memorie, as also, for gi∣uing
a taste of that large Truth,
in short speach, I haue (throgh
God his helpe) manifested my
poore power, but riche good∣will,
in this little booke. First,
I haue in English Poësie (drawn
according to an ancient staffe)
delivered summarily the hysto∣rie
of the olde and newe Testa∣ment:
Secondly, vpon the most
difficult points of the Poësie, I
haue dilated by way of Illustra∣tion,
not only for the fulfilling
of the hystorie: but also for dis∣cussing
sometimes, some neces∣sarie
question: as also annexed
hereto, such certaine computa∣tion
of time, for speciall joynts

of the Story, as whereby the
spirituall minded, may some∣thing
bee furthered to deeper
points contemplatiue. As thou
shalt receiue any good hereby,
so I pray thee be thankful vnto
God therfore, & quickly thou
shalt finde his hand vpon thee
to every good work. The Lord
be with thy spirit Amen.
