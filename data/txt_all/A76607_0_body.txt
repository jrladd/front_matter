My Lord,
IT would be an offence so unpardon∣able in the Judgment of all others, that I should never be able to for∣give it to my self, if I should give way in my own thoughts to the least ap∣prehension, that these mean lucubrati∣ons of mine, in this Version of David's Psalms and the Church-Hymns (the last efforts of a faint and feeble Vein of Poetry, especially at such an Age as thatof mine, wherein the floridness of fan∣cy is wont sensibly to wither even in such as have had far more of it then ever I durst pretend to) are any way qualified to lay the least claim to your Lordships acceptance (on, indeed to the favourable inspection of any Person of your Lordships Character in this Church) on the account of any intrinsecal value in the composure of them.
But, though (in the great Apostles Phrase, as Erasmus, and Drusius, and o∣ther; Interpreters render the original words. [] Rom. 1. 14.) I cannot presume, to pretend to the payment of any Debt hereby to the Learned: Yet I may hope, that what I have done therein, will in some mea∣sure free me from the charge of dy∣ing in arrear to the Ʋnlearned; whiles I thus endeavour to promote their Edi∣fication by furnishing them with smooth and plain Expressions for the assistance of their devotion in the praises they offer to God; which, I think I may say, I have, for the most part, so done, as togive no just occasion of nauseating any Person, either by the too much blunt∣ness of the Phrases, or obsoleteness of the Words I have used; which were the faults ordinarily complain'd of, in the Metrical Translations in common use among us.
And under this consideration onely (my Lord) I embolden my self (yet with all humility) to offer the Work it self to the Test of your Lordships judi∣cious candour; and withall to beg your acceptance of its Dedication to you as its Patron: Which adventure of mine, I intreat you to interpret, as a small Tes∣timony of the honour I have for your exemplary personal Piety and Devoti∣on, which very much sets off your o∣ther Episcopal Qualities, together with your steady adherence, (at this Time especially,) to the true Interests of a Church for which you have always had so great affection and esteem, and wherein you now make so great a Figure: And withall, of the gratefull sense I have of your Lordships humble condescension toown a small Relation, (upon the account of one, who is now (I am strongly con∣fident) singing Hymns to God in the Choir of Angels and Souls of just Per∣sons made perfect) unto my self, who am,
(My Lord)
