Gentlemen,
I Find this follow∣ing discourse was written many a day ago by Hesychius
 Pamphilus, in the native Language of Feliciana (a Language peculiar to that Island.) And because there are not many Copies of it, and the Language it self not much understood, but by such as have been bred and born in that Island, or have travelled thither, I thought good to translate it for the common benefit or delight of our Coun∣try-men.

The Story is not long, and in some things parallel to our present times, there∣fore did I judge the Tran∣slation more seasonable. If any reap either benefit or delight by reading of it, I reckon my pains more then requited. And for your selves, Gentlemen, if you shall please to own it as a testimony of singular re∣spect to you (after that to the Publick) I shall super-add
 that to the other En∣gagements upon him, who is,
Gentlemen,
