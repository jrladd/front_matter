Right Honourable,
REligion when established in Power, in Purity, is the walls, and Bulwarks of a Nation; a Isay 26. 1, 2, 3. Erek 21. 30, 31.Breach therein unrepaired, ex∣poseth a People to the greatest judgments. Next Religion, Ju∣stice takes place, as the most gratefull Sacrifice to God, service to a Common-wealth, causing the light of a Nations tranquillity to break forth gloriously as the Morning Sun. In respect here∣unto, I am bold to present your Honours with these ensuing considerations, (most humbly sub∣mitting them to your Honourable censure,) ex¦cusing my presumption, by my affection to Your Honours, with whose Eminency is conjoyned such clemency, that I may truly speak in the lan∣guage

of the Orator to Caesar, qui apud vo ∣dent dicere magnitudinem ignorant vest qui non audent, humanitatem. Your Honors are Prudent, (and wise with the Wisdome of God) to improve your opportunities, and valiant to act with the highest resolutions against the great∣est difficulties, (the tallest Cedars being fallen before you) that you need not counsell so much as Prayers, and our God Praise in you, who hath honoured you to be the Repairers of our breaches, the restorers of Paths to dwell in. There is but one thing lacking (which I humbly beseech your Honours to supply,) a sympatheticall commise∣ration of the condition, and tender sense of the crying necessities of Poor men (as of your own,) whose causes depend upon you, that such doe not suffer by you, who have suffered the ut∣most for you. Sad was his complaint who said, Heu! Pereo in medio amicorum. Livius makes mention of certain Govern∣ours, cald Aequi, to whom the Romane Legates Petitioning in cases of concernment, they recei∣ved this unworthy answer, Se alia interim actu∣rum, jussit cos ad quercum dicere: to whom these Petitioners worthily replyed, Et haec Sa∣crata quercus audiat foedus a vobis violatum. For the stone out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber will answer in the behalf of such, saith

the Prophet. Your Honours are the most wise, and faithfull▪ Physitians of State, to whom should the diseased Paetie nt have recourse for remedy, if not to you, by whom they expect every cure i∣to, tuto, & jucunde? You want neither Power, nor will, having been accustomed to help the ne∣cessitous, when all means in other Courts be inef∣fectuall; and where you want opportunities to give seasonable, and speedy Audience to all de∣siring it, you want not Authority to furnish o∣thers fearing God with such Power as to hear and determine, at least to examin and report their o∣pinions, (with humble submission to your Honors judgement) whereby you may comfortably further your account in the day of Christ, procure to your selves Honour and affection from the Lord and good men, with the blessing of the Poor and nee∣dy: Prevent those Punishments upon your per∣sons, or Posterities, the sadconsequents of such a sinfull neglect: you remember the story of Dion, and cannot forget how often the Lord, hath a∣larmd you by the Souldier, (his rod upon the Isa. 58.backs of such Princes, and States who break not the yoaks of the oppressed,) which I hope you re∣spect as a divine monition to attend this duty.
Your Honours are not ignorant of the necessities of times, and how prejudiciall it is to those who have suffered and lost much, to expend time, and

means in travels, attendance, and al in vain.  the Publike suffers alittle, there private uch  Gospel, and your selves most of all, by the disabi∣lity of your friends, for them to live in bonds, who had they but Iustice might he free, in their minds, from cares, Bodies from restraint, and Purses from want: to live in reproach, whose upright inten∣tions are impeached, whose confidence in your Ju∣stice is shamed, as if you were to your friends a brook whose streams are failing, such instruments may be needed in future, whose by-past services are forgotten at present; such persons who complain with silence, with patience, with expectance, de∣serve in reason, and in respect audience before those (who yet have gained it) who vilify your Persons, traduce your Authority, render your Acts dishonourable to the world, because they obtain not their own ambitious ends; Oh force not the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Judge of all the World to whom they commit their cause, to doe that Justice which I tremble to Remember, but hope that you will pi∣ously consider, to divert the stroke thereof: for the Ae 8. the whole.Lord hath sworu by the Excellency of Jacob, that for this the Land shall tremble, and the Inhabi∣tants thereof shall mourn; that the Judgment thereof shall be sodain, and unexpected, a devour∣ing,

desolating judgment, after the greatest hopes of happinesse, even because yee make the Poor ofthe Land to fail: that is, their hearts to fail, their lives to con∣sume with cares, with griefs, I swear by my self saith Ier. 22. the whole.the Lord, that this House shall became a desolation: If you doe not deliver the spoiled out of the hands of the Oppresser, If you doe not judge the cause of the nee∣dy, Ier. 21. 1, 13.in the morning, (preventing the expectance of the period.) My fury shall goe forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it; I am unwilling in respect to disappointment to munifst to the world my particular complaint and condition, these who knew me when resident in the City, and who know me new, know my afflictions for, and affection unto the Publick in all vicissitudes unto this day, and that weak service which without respect to any recompence, I tendered to the State, Tempore Reipublicae Paroxysmi, (in open Parliament acknowledged then to conduce to the Preservation thereof, of the City, and the Com∣mon-wealth in apparent peril of death,) upon which I was promised it, as but a small and reasonable fa∣vour, Justice, in a cause that concerns my whole out∣ward estate, a cause uncapable of finall determiniati∣on in any other court of judicature, a cause having no reference to any Member of Parliament, or to any Per∣son indempnified thereby for any demer it since this Session, or to any receipts of mony out of the Publike

Treasure; A cause as much your Honours as mine,  Jesus Christs rather then either yours or mine,  might be finished in four houres time in a select C∣mittee if once appointed for Audience thereof, which in 8 years space I never could obtain, although some Honorable Members have expressed their deep ses of the extremity of my oppression, that prejudice which I have sustained by this delay, and therefore I beleeve it impossible that so just a cause should mis∣carry in the hands of so just a Parliament▪ My earnest prayer for your Honours shall bee that the splendor of this Representative, may by the highest Acts of sin∣cere Reformation of Religion, of impartiall Admini∣stration of Justice, dazle the eyes of all Europe, that your Power and greatnesse thereby may bee rendered formidable to all your adversaries, Domestick and Forain, by Sea and Land, in England, and Ireland, that the people of these Nations by your Pious Pru∣dent, Righteous, and Resolved indeavours may be assu∣red, ut Pacem summam obtinebimus in Patria, cum ipso Deo, & nobis inter not, ubi nullum erit bel∣lum nulla contradictio, which is the hearts desire of
