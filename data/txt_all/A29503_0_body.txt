SIR,
THIS small Volume was de∣signed, humbly to crave the Acceptance of your late Roy∣al Consort, that most truly Excellent Princess; who not only heard, but relished Discourses proper for her E∣dification. These present ones dare pretend only to an Attempt, and en∣deavour
 for such a Purpose. But she is for ever gone from hence, where her vertuous and pious Soul had neither Books nor Company good enough for its Entertainment! May her just Character be preserved, fresh and fair, to the last of Time! may her goodly Presence strike the Imagination of every one who en∣ters into your Royal Palaces, that her exemplary Vertue, Piety, Pru∣dence and Sweetness may never be forgotten there.
Forgive me, Great Sir, if I for once lightly touch the Wound, not only of your own Royal Heart, but also of the Hearts of all your Sub∣jects, except here and there a Self-interested, weak and peevish thing, or two, in this matter, whatever they may be else-where.

 But as this severe Providence hath brought with it a mighty Loss, and not reparable to Your Majesty one way; so hath it given you a mighty Advantage another; for all the Af∣fections and Hopes which your Peo∣ple had divided between two, are now publickly vested in, and settled upon Your Majesty's Person alone. And we hope, and pray, that as God will continue your own Portion of his Blessings to you, so he will not with∣hold hers from you. So that now your force being doubled and uni∣ted too, cannot probably be much longer resisted, by your haughty and malicious, though puissant Enemy.
That God would continue and multiply his Blessings upon Your Royal Head, fill your Heart with Pie∣ty, Wisdom and Integrity in all your Counsels, prosper your Arms for the Chastisement of Tyranny, Violence
 and Injustice; for the Peace, Safety, and Universal Happiness of your Peo∣ple, and all Europe, is the constant Prayer of
