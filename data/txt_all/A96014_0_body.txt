SIR,
WEre I to make this Addresse
to a person unacquainted
with my Authour, and the
Work I now publish, it
were, haply, pardonable in
me, to give it and him, the greatest
Elogies a piece and person of so much
worth might justly claime. Nor were it
hard to imagine, what I might, did

I make it my businesse, say of one
of the most eminent members of the
FRECNH ACADEMY (an Asso∣ciation
of VVits, such as no age till this
ever saw) a man so rarified by Tra∣vell
and experience into the noblest
heights of an elaborate Eloquence,
and one so versed in Criticisme, that
hee could raise beauty and lustre
out of the ruines and rubbish of the
mst ancient Authours. But, Sir,
since my application is to you, whose
correspondence with Learning is so
universall, the trouble is spar'd, and
if there be any thing remarkable by way
of account of him, it is but fit it were
done (pro more) in another place.
Nor is there, in this, any more neces∣sity,
I should (though I might easily take
the occasion) celebrate this kinde of wri∣ting
as the most advantageous of any.
It is in a manner the Cement of all

society, the foundation and superstru∣cture
of all Friendship and conversa∣tion,
the remedy of absence, the In∣telligentiall
part of all Loves, which
which layes the plots and carries on the
designes of united hearts at the grea∣test
distance; in a word, it is the ge∣nerall
Agent of all inclinations and
passions, and what, out of the rough∣nesse
of Barbarisme, hath raised
man to the highest Gentilesses, court∣ships,
and civilities. My designe
therefore is, not to make, but, renew
your acquaintance with the exquisite de
VOITƲRE, yet farre from a pre∣sumption,
that your entertainment of
him in this language will be proportio∣nable
to your esteem of him in his owne.
But, if I may measure it by the infi∣nite
affection, and consequently, the
generall indulgence and patronage you
have for all Learning, that you will af∣ford

it such as it may in some sort de∣serve,
is, I must confesse, a confidence
I know not how to avoid, but presses
so much upon me, that it contributes
not a little to that it is in me, thus pub∣lickly,
though with te greatest submis∣sions
and respects, to expresse my self,
SIR,
