GReat Earle, whose braue Heroike minde is higher
And nobler, then thy noble high Degree:
Whose outwarashape, though it most louely be
Doth in faire Robes a fairer Soule attier:
Who rich in fading wealth, endlesse Treasure
Of Vertue, Valour, Learning, richer art,
Whose present greatnesse, men esteeme but part
Of what by line of future Hope they measure.
Thou worthy Sonne vnto a peer elesse mother,
Or Nephew to great Sidney of renowne,
Who hast deseru'd thy Coronet, to crowne
With Lawrell crowne, a crowne excelling th'other
I consecrate these Rimes to thy great Name,
Which if thou like, they seeke no other fame.
