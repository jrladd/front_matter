MADAM,
THis following small Treatise comes to beg your Honours shelter and acceptance, which if it be ever safe, I am very certain it must be with your Ladyship, who (without flattery) are so generally known to be the Patro∣ness and Protectrix of all that is Pious and Vertuous, that I can never in the least doubt of it till even Vertue it self comes to want a Patronage. I dare not, nay indeed I cannot tell the World how much you deserve that Title, it being a Task too difficult far for my undertakings (for who can paint the Heavens) besides I am so well acquainted with your La∣dyships Temper, that I know your Noble Mind loves the substance only, not the outward shew; and delights more in be∣ing Vertuous, than in appearing or being known to be so, which makes me decline those praises which really and deserved∣ly your Vertues call for. — I cannot in the least think that your Honour stands
in need of any of those following Helps and Directions, your whole life being indeed nothing else but a Map or Tran∣script of Piety, and had I consulted your Ladyship, I know they would have been much more compleat; however (at least I hope) it may contribute some assistance to them who have not better advice. And being to make this publick, I know no person that I have so many Obligati∣ons to dedicate it to as your Ladyship; and having nothing better to present by way of an ackonwledgment, I hope your Ladyship will not refuse to accept this (though of a small value) from
From Newcastle upon Tine,
Nov. 2d. 1682.
