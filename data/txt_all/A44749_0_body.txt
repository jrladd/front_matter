SIR,
THer are many who have written of the Pre-eminences and An∣tiquity, of the Power and Pre∣rogatives of France and Spain in order to a Precedence or Su∣periority; But while they magnifie their own Kings, they derogat from other: Moreover, while they produce their Resons, they often fall into such excesses of speech, that they may be calld rather Rodomontados then Resons.
But ther is none who hath written yet of Great Britain in relation to this Point; ther∣fore tis the principal scope of this VVork, wherin ther is an Endevour to make Her bet∣ter understood; and to prove by Relevant and lively Resons, (without offence to any) That the Monark of Great Britain if He go not be∣fore, at least He ought not to come behind any King whatsoever.
Now, in regard tis a Theme of so sublime

a Nature, and depends chiefly upon ancient Records, History, and the Opinion of Ci∣vilians, (who have bin principally consulted) the Author hath had a special Care and Cau∣tion to be very exact and tru in his Quotati ons of all kinds.
Lastly, The Author (most humbly under favor) did deem Himself not altogether inca∣pable of such a Task, for having bin in most of the great Courts of Christendom; For having Negotiated by Royal Commission a∣bove three years in the Court of Spain; For having bin Orator in an extraordinary Am∣bassage to Denmark, and divers Princes of Germany; For having bin so often in France, and sundry Courts of Italy, &c. He may be thought not to be Impar Negotio.
May all the Blessings and best Influences of Heven light upon Your Royal Head this New-Year, and many, many, ma∣ny more, according to the due and day∣ly Devotions of the humblest of
Calendis Januarii, 1664.
