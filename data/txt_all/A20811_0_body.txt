I vvill not striue m'invention to inforce,
vvith needlesse words your eyes to entertaine,
T'obserue the formall ordinarie course
That euery one so vulgarly doth faine,
Our interchanged and deliberate choice,
Is with more firme and true election sorted,
Then stands in censure of the common voyce,
That with light humor fondly is transported,
Nor take I patterne of anothers praise,
Then what my pen may constantly avow,
Nor walke more publique, nor obscurer waies
Then vertue bids, and iudgement will alow;
So shall my loue, and best endeuours serue you,
And still shall studie, still so to deserue you.
