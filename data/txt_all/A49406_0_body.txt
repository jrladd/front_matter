SIR,
THough I expect this Sermon should be en∣countred by two sorts of censures; First, of those who Envy that goodness which they will not imitate; and for the Vindication of their own worthlesness and barrenness, detract from the Excellence and Fruitfulness of others: Next of those, who may be disgusted at the courseness and heaviness of it: Yet this could not discourage me from the publication of it: For as to the former, if they could deserve my consideration, I am sufficient∣ly fortified against 'em by being conscious to my self, that I have impartially follow'd strict Truth, either personally known to me, or abundantly attested; As to the latter I think verily, they do me no great wrong, for I agree thus far with em, that the dis∣course is by no means equal to the subject: But in this I have this comfort, that thought it can give no Lustre or Dignity to the subject, it may receive
both in some measure from it, and so may prove useful in despight of it's flatness. Besides, Exam∣ples of this nature ought not to be stifled or sup∣pressed, as being such excellent Vindications of our Christian profession, such brisk reproaches and con∣vincing reproofs of the Coldness and Irreligion of evil men, and such excellent Incentives of Emula∣tion to the good. And yet after all this, I think ve∣rily, I should never have suffered this discourse to have seen the Light (such was my value for it!) had I not been over-rul'd, as you know, by the importu∣nity of such, whose Friendhip I have no ground to question, and to whose Judgment, I have just ground to pay a deference: Now that it is pub∣lisht, it doth of Right belong to you; to whom I offer it, and intreat you to accept it, notwithstand∣ing it's imperfections; as a testimony of my Re∣spect for you, and of my kindness for the Memory of your dear Father, and my dear Friend departed, I am
SIR,
