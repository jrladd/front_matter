THE singular grace and Munificent bounty, which your Grace pleased to vouchsafe my hum∣ble petition, for re∣paire of the Parish Church, where I liue vnder your Honourable Patronage, most Noble Lord, bindeth, and at once imboldneth
mee to make this publike acknowledgement, hauing laboured in the spirituall building, whilst the materiall was in hand, to set vp through lights in the house of God. Such pi∣ous deedes of Gratious Lords, and Noble Benefactours, are worthy to be reported after many reasons, now principally for this, that the world may discerne against the slanderous ad∣versaries of true religion, that shee hath not beene barren, nor vnfruitfull of good vvorkes, whilst in a fewe late yeares, more Churches, Colledges, and Hospitals haue beene repaired, and built, then in many ages of their devoutest ignorance and superstition; In the meane time what havocke haue they made of the Churches, not breaking down the carued worke with axes, and hammers, but devouring the liuing tēples of the holy Ghost with fier and sword, & setting vp their abomination of desolation, where they can prevaile? Your Grace will goe on to do good as you are great, and to Patronise the truth, which here comes into your presence, in her naked simplicity, crauing to goe forth honoured with your name and authority:
Knowing that God will honour them that honour him,
1 Sam. 2.30. but they that dispise him shall be lightly esteemed. To him therefore, ha∣ving learned of the good courtier Nehemiah,
Nehem: 2.4. to direct our prayers even whilst wee make pe∣tition vnto Princes, I bowe the knees of my soule, that hee will bee pleased to adde of his Grace to your Grace still more and more, who is able to make all graces abound towards you,
2. Cor. 9.8.11. that you alwaies hauing all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good worke, which shall cause by vs many thanke giuings vnto God.
