Sir,
THis Vessell, with her small
Freight (not despairing of other
Harbour) moves to put in to
the Haven of your favour;
The Greatest Tempest she rides under, is
the Owners feares, which one benigne
Beame from you Calmes and Disperses:
Acceptance Dignifies the Adventure, and
Crowns his Endeavours; who, yet a stranâˆ£ger,
is Ambitious to be Endennized (with
Pardon, and Permission.)
