AMong all Sacred and Diuine Bookes, which teach that great Mystery of godlinesse (Right Ho∣nourable) there are none more Mysticall, then the Canticles of Sa∣lamon: The Epistle to the Hebrewes: and the Apocalipse or Reuelation of S. Iohn. In the first of these three, we are by a continuall Allegorie of Mariage, instructed in the most sweet and straight coniunction betweene Christ and his Church. In the second, vnder comparison, with Tipes and Fi∣gures of the Law, we do learne the perfection of Christs Priest-hood and Sacrifice, for full recon∣ciliation

of all elect sinners with God. In the third (which hath as many Mysteries, as words) by dark Propheticall Phrases, wee haue fully deciphered the condition of the Christian Church, till the re∣turne of Christ her Husband; together, with the certaine ruine, both of Turkish and Popish Regi∣ments, as most infest enemies to the spouse and truth of God. The explication of these portions of Sacred writ, by an easie and familiar way of a Dictionary, I haue thought it my dutie (humbly crauing your Lordship so to interpret it) to dedi∣cate vnto you (my Right Hon: good Lord, to whō for manie respects, especially for your gracious fauour to my meane selfe, and your great affecti∣on to the Diuine truth, I holde my selfe much in∣debted) as I haue put foorth a generall Register of Sacred wordes, with their significations, scattered throughout the whole Bible, vnder the Names of three Right Reuerend persons, mine especiall Be∣nefactours. If by my Diuine Candle, there shall arise any light, for the better vnderstanding of hea∣uenly and Holie-Scriptures; let all glorie be giuen to him, who is the Father of Lights, from whose Light, we all receiue Light; and vnto whose bles∣sed guiding & protection, I commit your Honor, with your right Honorable and vertuous Lady, & hopeful Children. From mine house in Cant. Decem. 1611.
