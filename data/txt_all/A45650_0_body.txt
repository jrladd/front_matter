MADAM,
THE Noble Character your Ladyship is deser∣servedly Mistress of, and the continued Favours you have shewn to that STAGE, which I have the Honour to share your Ladyship's Patronage on, has occasion'd the trouble I am now giving you. And tho' the Decscription of your Ladyship's Virtues shou'd be the Employment of an abler Pen, I cou'd not but rejoice in the opportunity of being the first who shou'd acquaint the Publick, with those Excellen∣cies which your Ladyship is so communicative of, and yet so industrious in concealing.
To do GOOD, Madam, is the Property of several Ladies: But to do GOOD, and be unwilling to hear of it; to give Assistance and Relief to those that are in Distress, and with∣hold the knowledge of their Benefactress from 'em, is a Cha∣racter few Persons of Quality can lay the same claim to, as the COUNTESS of BURLINGTON.

But I forget those Vertues I was just now commending in your Ladyship, and at the same time that I am telling the World of the reservedness of your Temper, in your De∣sires to have your WORTH conceal'd, I am committing a fault against it, by giving your Ladyship the knowledge, that I am Partaker of that Secret, which 'tis your Lady∣ship's Pleasure shou'd have no sharer but your self, I shall therefore, Madam, forbear doing any farther violence to your Modesty, and only beg your Ladyship's Pro∣tection for a Play which stands rank'd amongst the Un∣fortunate; and whose Author will have all imaginable rea∣son to rejoice for its want of success, could its misfor∣tunes endear it to your Ladyship's compassionate Recep∣tion.
LOVE is the LOTTERY, Madam, which begs your Acceptance; and your Ladyship that has drawn its CHIEFEST PRIZE, in the NOBLE LORD, your La∣diship's most EXCELLENT HUSBAND, will make a∣mends for the Blanks which its Author has drawn in it, by giving it the Honour of your Ladyship's perusal. And tho' the judgment your Ladyship shall make of it, will not (I'm afraid) run Counter with what has been already given, yet it will be enough to take off from its Censure with the Pub∣lick, that it is read by a Lady, whose very perusal is a re∣commendation to that of others, and whose Judgment has that accuracy in it, as to permit Her to read nothing almost, but what deserves the employment of Her leisure.
This, Madam, cannot but lead me into the notice of your Excellent Endowments, and force me to speak of those Ac∣quisitions of Mind, which are as uncommon to Persons of your Sex and Quality, as they are particular to your Self.

To be skill'd in History, Madam; to be an Accomplish'd Lady, and an excellent Christian: To be a Pattern of Be∣haviour at the COURT, and an Example of Devotion at the CHURCH, is as much beyond my Expression, as it is be∣yond other Ladies Imitation. I shall therefore have said all that my Wonder will permit me, and more than your Mo∣desty wou'd willingly suffer, by concluding your Chara∣cter with the Addition of that of an INCOMPARABLE WIFE, an AFFECEIONATE MOTHER, an INDUL∣GENT MISTRESS, and an UNWEARIED BENEFAC∣TRESS; and I shall join with the Prayers of your Noble Lord, the tenderest of Husbands; the Wishes of your Chil∣dren, the living Instances of the BEST of MOTHER's Per∣fections, the Desires of your Servants, and the Entreaties of the many numbers which wou'd not be living, but by YOUR GOODNESS: If I shall pray that your Ladyship may long continue to be the GLORY of this Age, as you will be the Admiration of the next.
But that I may not detain your Ladyship any longer from those obliging Offices which are so little practis'd by others, and so much by your Self, I shall only ask leave to subscribe,
Madam,
