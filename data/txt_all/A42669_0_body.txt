SIR,
THE known Loyalty of your Family, and that most Eminent and memorable In∣stance of it, the Protecting the sacred Person of our late most Gracious Soveraign, King Charles the Second, in his most happy Disguise in your House near Bristol, when being hunted as a Partridge upon the Mountains, he took Shelter under the Shadow of your Roof, and from thence escap'd, by a miraculous Providence from the many Snares that were laid for him, by his bloo∣dy Enemies; This alone will eternalize your Name, and render you deservedly Famous to Po∣stetrity, and will also bear a large and a glori∣ous part in the History of those Times, and of
the Restauration of that Illustrious Monarch.
But there is also another Monument to pre∣serve the Name and Honour of your Family, which at the Request and Desire of your most virtuous and Religious Lady, is here presented to your view, and dedicated unto you.
It is indeed but an imperfect Collection, some scatter'd and inco-herent Fragments, the Glean∣ings (as I may call them) and REMAINS of a most excllent Person, your own Off-spring and Is∣sue; and therefore, you Sir, have the best Right and Title to this Product of her overslow∣ing Wit and Fancy, and at the same time (which very rarely meets in one Person) most Profound and solid Judgment; which may serve as some faint Idea to shew us, of what an Inestimable Treasure the World has been unhappily depri∣ved by the Primature Death of this admirable Young Lady your Daughter.
But as imperfect as it is, yet from this light Tast, this short and transient view of what she did but a her spare Hours, as her  only;
and by the by, it is easy to see what transcendant Strength of Reason and Engagement she was Mistress of, though at very young and tender years; what an excellent Example and Pattern of Virtue the World might have been bless'd withal, to help and reform it in this degenerate and worst Ages; and what admirable max∣ims of Prudence and Piety she would have been capable of giving for the Conduct of Human Life: All which, coming from so fine an hand, would have been read and admired (when most others would have been despis'd) by the most celebrated Wits and Criticks of the Age, and could not have chosen but have had a mighty Instuence up∣on them. It will, I doubt not, be look'd upon as an inestimable Treasure by all her Friends; and as even the Filings of Gold are precious, and care∣fully preserved, so will those GOLDEN RE∣MAINS of this most Excellent Lady, be care∣fully laid up and valued as they deserve, by all that knew her; and especially Sir, by you her Father, and by her most affectionate and afstict∣ed
Mother, as the best Reliques of a Person so very deservedly dear to you Both; and who can never die so long as this Monument of her Virtue, Wit, and Ingenuity shall continue, which I pro∣phecy, shall out-live the Marble Monuments; which you her dear Parents, in Testimony of your most tender and affectionate Remembrance of Her, have with great Cost and Care erected to her Memory in Westminster-Abby, She being the last of your Surviving Issue.
That your Lady and your self, may in this your unspeakable Loss and Affliction, be mutual Com∣fort to, and always happy in each other; That you may be bless'd together with long Prosperity here on Earth, and enjoy everlasting Happiness and Felicity hereafter, is the hearty Desire and Prayer of
Sir, 
April 4. 1699.
