My Lord,
WHILE the World is so fond of Voyages, and the Discoveries of Unknown Coun∣tries; I hope it will not be unacceptable to bring into view one of the best Lives of one of the Greatest Prelates of this Church; writ in Latin with great Judgment by a Man very emi∣nent in his Profession. If this Pre∣late had lived in happier Times, he would probably have exerted those

great Talents which he carried far in so dark an Age, in Services of a high nature. He had a true Judgment and firm Courage, with a generous Temper, and was a great Patron and Promoter of Learning; He despised Wealth, was free from aspiring, and asserted the Rights of the Crown, and the Liberties of this Church against Papal Usurpations. These were great Qualities, and so much the greater, because the Corruptions of the Clergy from the Papacy down to the Begging Orders, were then to an insupportable degree.
In any other Age the publishing a Life which has so great a Relation to the most Glorious part of our History might have lookt like a reproach of the Time in which it came out. But the Present Age may well bear it, in which if we have not carried our Conquest in∣to France as was then done, yet we

see a GREAT PRINCE who has far out-done the Performances of that time. Then a Feeble King and divided Court made the Work as easy in it self, as it looks great in History: But we have seen a Mighty and United Power managed by Wise Counsels, flush'd with a long course of Success, that gave Law to All about it, stopt in its full career by a King born to be a Blessing to the present Age, and a Wonder to all Succeeding ones; to Whose Reign the most renouned Pieces of our History are but foiles to set it off, and make it shine the brighter.
My Lord, I could not be long in suspence for the choice of a proper Patron to my small Interest in this Work, which is only the care of the Translation of it into English: The See that you do now govern with so Apostolical a Temper, and in none of the easiest Times, is not the chief reason of my addressing to

Your Grace the Life of one of the most Eminent of all Your Predecessors. I could give many more Reasons for the choice that relate immediately to Your Self, but I will rather leave it to the Reader to find out, than offer a thing so ingrateful to Your Lordship: I pay Your Grace so profound a Reverence, that I will not venture on that which I know will offend You, for I am with the truest Zeal, and the highest Re∣spect possible,
My Lord,
