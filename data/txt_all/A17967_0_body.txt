COnsyderyng that the know∣ledge of thynges past (most excel∣lent prince) is most necessarye for such as woulde passe ouer the tyme to come in a decent and Godly or∣der, and that the greatest nombre of youre Maiesties people doo not vnderstande other languages, then theyr naturall tounge:
I haue thought it my duetye (beynge one that spendeth all hys tyme in the settynge forth of bokes in the Englyshe tounge) emongest all other to set forth thys shorte Cronicle.
Wherein is briefly declared all that is nedefull to be knowen, concernyng thynges done in tymes

passed. The learned haue  the latyne tounge, and therfore my laboure maye seme the lesse profy∣table vnto them. But yet yf my knowledge would haue serued me to haue translated it as eloquētly as it is written in latyne: I doubt not but the lear∣ned also myghte haue founde some swetnes in my laboures. And not wythstandynge my rudenes (most excellent Prynce) I trust your maiestie wyll (after your accustomed clemencye) accept my good wyll, whyche thynge I do not doubte shall encou∣rage all faythfull englyshe men to embrace my la∣boures and gather the fruytes of the same. To prayse the worcke which being set forth to be reade of all men wyll prayse it self, were but a labour halfe loste, for such a thing nedeth no prayse, but is so ma¦nifestly good that all men that reade it shalbe for∣ced to prayse it. Other prayse therfore I wyll not geue it, but that it is a worcke worthy the name of so excellent a prynce as your mayestye is, and ther∣fore worthy to be embraced of all your faythfull subiectes. Whyche thynge I most hartely wyshe to come to passe to the glorye of God, your Maiestyes honour, and the profyte of all your fayth∣full subiectes. Sobeit.
