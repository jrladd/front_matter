SIR,
'TIS a Maxim of Pru∣dence given by some of the Nicer Describers of the Bounds of Gratitude, That it ought to be temper'd between a total Neglect and a full and just Requital. To strike off all Scores is, they say, as uncivil as to dis∣charge none, and every whit

as disingenuous not to suffer, as not to acknowledge an Obligation.
Now, Sir, 'tis one of the proper Happinesses of my little Fortune to be necessa∣rily cast upon this measure. I am got too far in your Accounts to be able to re∣quite to the full, some part of them I must ever leave uncrossed as a standing Hold upon me; and tho my Gra∣titude it self be never so strong and pregnant, yet the most forward Instance of it can rise no higher than an Acknowledgment.

And as this is the utmost I can do, so of doing this too I have so few Capacities and Opportunities, that I am the less willing to let go any that offer themselves; which indeed has given a speedier Issue to my Delibe∣ration, whether I ought to address these Discourses to your Patronage or no, which perhaps without the For∣mality of a Dedication, would of right belong to you, as falling within your District, and as being the Fruits of that Retirement which by your Free Bounty I enjoy.

As an Acknowledgment therefore of this and your other constant Favours, I presume to put these Dis∣courses into your Hands, which I hope will be able to do both You and Me that Justice, as to convince the World, that as you pro∣ceeded by generous and un∣corrupt Measures in dispo∣sing of this Publick Trust, so you was not very much mistaken in your Choice, when you thought fit to Oblige
