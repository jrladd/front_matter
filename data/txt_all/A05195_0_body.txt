Worthy Sir,
WHen in many yeeres by long ex∣perience I had furnished this my Northerne Orchard and Countrey Garden with need∣full plants and vsefull hearbes, I did impart the view thereof to my friends, who resorted to me to conferre in matters of that nature, they did see it, and seeing it desired, and I must not denie now the publishing of it (which then I allotted to my priuate de∣light) for the publike profit of others. Wherefore, though I could pleade custome the ordinarie excuse of all Writers, to chuse a Patron and Protector of their Workes, and so shroud my selfe from scandall vnder your honourable fauour, yet haue I certaine reasons to excuse this my presumption: First, the many courtesies

you haue vouchsafed me. Secondly, your delightfull skill in matters of this nature. Thirdly, the profit which I receiued from your learned discourse of Fruit-trees.
Fourthly, your animating and assisting of others to such endeuours. Last of all, the rare worke of your owne in this kind all which to publish vnder your protection, I haue aduentured (as you see) Vouchsafe it therefore entertainement, I pray you, and I hope you shal finde it not he vnpofitablest seruant of your retinue: for when your serious employments are ouerpassed, it may inter∣pose some commoditie, and raise your contentment out of varietie.
