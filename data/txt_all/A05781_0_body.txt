WOrlds wonder, learned, mightie Cinthia,
Artes Darling, & Times Babe, subiect of fame,
Wits obiect, Arcadian Pastorella
Wisdomes Trophae honor and vertues frame,
Pardon (Princesse) though I conceale thy name.
Thy Traine, and Paragons of high degree
Homer and Virgill, vsed to doe the same,
And Astrophill when hee decyphred thee,
Baxtero Mastix may disparage mee,
That I dare make thee subiect of my pen,
At whose aspect Poets amazed be,
As things beyond the reach, of priuate men.
But wonder, Learning, witte, Fame, Wisdome, Time,
Shall glorifie the subiect of this Rime.


Time, wisdome, learning, witte wonder and fame,
Endimion tould me should attend on thee:
He consecrat's Ourania to thy name,
Without respect of paedanticall fee,
But if perchaunce great Astrophill thou see,
And Fates with-holde thee from Endymion:
Hee humbly sues that hee released be,
Of arrogancy, and proesumption,
That he without his knights iniunction
Should dedicate vnto thy princely Shrine,
The treasurie, and hidden function,
Of Iehouahs Hexameron diuine.
And he that whilome liu'd in Graecian deep's,
Craues helpe of thee, as he in English creep's.
