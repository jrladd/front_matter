Right Honourable,

hath committed the Oversight and
Care of a great many Persons, unto your
Charge; And GOD be thanked at present, this Ho∣nourable
and Ancient City, the Metropolis of Scotland,
is provided with Magistrates and Counsellors, who tes∣tifie

Suppressed, Even tho the Government hath lately E∣mitted
a Proclamation, for putting the Ancient Laws a∣gainst
such Transgressours, more punctually in Excuti∣on.

I can throw in, towards the prosecution of such a Lau∣dable
Design. Your Lordship and Honours are the only
Persons, I judge these few Lines can most fitly be ad∣dressed
unto. Wherefore I with all Humility offer Them
to Your Consideration, and if they may Contribute
any wayes towards the discouraging of Prophanity and
Looseness, it shall yeild great Satisfaction to
