Most Gracious Lord.
YOur Highnesses last Con∣ference
with me at the

time of my travelling through
those Countries, about the
true and neerest way to at∣tain
unto perfection in Phy∣sick,
is still fresh in my me∣mory:
And upon that Quaere,
I proposed unto your High∣nesse
for answer, the golden
Doctrine of the sharp-sighted
Philosopher Helmont, sunt vi∣delicet
Sulphura quaedam,
quibus correctis atque per∣fectis,
tota morborum cohors
auscultat. The truth of this
Doctrine I did then demon∣ctrate
with strong Arguments
of the Anima Antimonii, and
if my occasions had permitted
me to remain there for some

longer time, I would have
cleared the same by experi∣mental
proof; Now although
this great Encomium attribu∣ted
by Helmont unto some Sul∣phurs,
may with truth be gi∣ven
unto the Sulphur of An∣timony,
yet the Tincture of
the Copper deserveth it much
more, as having obtained of
Nature a higher degree of No∣bility
than the former; and
and therefore its Anima is
called Sulphur Philosopho∣rum
by Paracelsus, Basilius
Valentinus, and others, in re∣gard
of its great Vertue and
Power in relieving the sick in
their pains and great extre∣mities,

which many Physiti∣ans
clearly apprehended from
the Writings of Helmont,
and therefore greedily sought
for the same, but none almost
hitherto found it. Hence great
complaint is made by them e∣very
where, that they cannot
attain unto this great Myste∣ry,
nor sever the Golden Tin∣cture
from its Leprous Body.
And therefore I counted it to
be my duty as a Christian, to
set upon the Table that little
light of my knowledge in this
Mystery, which God in his
Mercy bestowed upon me, to
the end that all that are
chosen for it by God and

born to it by Nature, may see
my gift, and look into the mat∣ter
it self, also together with
me may find out this precious
Jewel of Health, and be par∣takers
of the same, and thence
much profit may arise unto the
sick. In regard therefore, that
your Highnesse was at that
time well pleased with my E∣lucidation
concerning the Tin∣cture
of Antimony, I thought
good to dedicate this also to
your Highnesse, to the end that
you may perceive the Won∣ders
of God in the Copper also,
and thence praise His holy
Name: Hoping that your
Highnesse will Graciously ac∣cept

of this my Lucubration,
and affection to serve you. And
I heartily commend your High∣nesse
to the continuation of the
mercy of God, remaining
