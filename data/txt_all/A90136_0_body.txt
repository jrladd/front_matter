HAD it not been a neces∣sary Acknow∣ledgment, I had not presum'd (Gen∣tlemen) to have occasi∣oned you a Blush, in throwing such a Trifle as this unto your Prote∣ction.

And yet, I fear, that what I design as an Expression of my Gra∣titude for your many Favours, may draw on me a greater Obligation from you; I mean in receiving this into your Patronage: It is the first thing I have done publick Pennance for in a Sheet: Which, yet, had Mr. Blount been less hasty, had been more Correct and Pardonable.

You know the Circumstan∣ces that provoked me to this Attempt; I shall only put you in mind, that—
Nil habet Infaelix Paupertas durius in se,
Quam quod Ridicules ho∣mines facit!
I shall not need to trou∣ble you with the English on't, to whom the Latin is as familiar and easy as your own English Tongue: Nor wou'd I

have the Ladys under∣stand it, lest it spoil my Fortunes.
I must confess there is much in that! But there will be infinitely more in your goodness, if you will not, for this, lessen the kind opinion you have hi∣therto had of, most Dear Friends!
