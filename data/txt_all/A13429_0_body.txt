KInd friend, I am sure you can defend me from being bitten with your Beares, though not from being back-bitten by Envie; you can stave me, and save me, from the Goring of your Bulls, but there are too many heards of other Horned Beasts to But at my Inventions, and tosse my harm∣lesse

meaning, as their empty Iudge∣ments, and Witlesse fancies are en∣clin'd; howsoever I am resolv'd to love you, and not to Respect them I am glad that you can say that an ex∣cessive time of charge is past with you, and I hope for better dayes and times. I have touched here and there merrily upon the Game, but so farre from offence, that I doe expect that it will be pleasing both to the Wise, and to the Indifferent Readers. And mee thinkes very fools should not be an∣gry with it, for I have thrust in a great many Bables to please them to If any thing doe seeme distastefull in it, my Comfort is, that a Wise man will not set his Wit to mine, and be offended but if a Foole be angry, then I will

not set my Wit to his, and take excep∣tions. And thus with my best wishes to you and yours, I remaine a poore friend to you and yours,
