Worthy Lord:
I Must intreate you to prouide
Your selfe with proper speede,
T'attend the Nuptials of the Bride,
Our kin, it is a (greede,)
'Twixt Isr'els of-spring and Gods soone
A marriage must be made,
And messengers abroad are runne,
All good men to perswade,
To come, to see it solemmiz'd,
And I am one of those,
That haue some worthy friends aduis'd,
To free them from these woes:
That times and men are subiect too,
And it's become my lot,
By Gods Commission t'inuite you,
And I know I shall not

Want audience, nor place, nor time
To tell my Embassie:
Imbrace it (Lord) for 'tis diuine,
And the best legacie
I can bestow, I know you are
Religious, learn'd, and wise,
And noble therefore I shall share,
Your fauours, I surmise.
