HAving lately read in print these Lines: A Tantivy-Preacher in the Tem∣ple, upon that Text, Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's; said, What is Caesars? What things?—I an∣swer, Caesar shall have your Goods, your Lands, your Wives, your Children, your All; all is Caesar's: But some may say, (quoth Tantivy-Preacher, fitter to preach at Tyburn, than the Temple) If Caesar shall have all, then what shall God have? I answer, (quoth he) God shall have your Souls: But as for your Bodies, your Lands, your Goods, your Lives, your Chil∣dren, and your Wives, they are Caesar's.
To this strange and unexpected Charge, I return these Answers: That I have had the honour to
 preach in the Temple these 20 Years and more, but never did I hear such words to be spoken there. Besides, it is not probable, that those two honourable and learned Societies, who understand and love their Proprieties so well, should tamely and silently pass by such Divinity. As for my own person, against whom, I am told, several ways that this Charge was intended, I did call to mind that I did once preach upon that Text, Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's; and upon a search, I found that the Sermon was preached No∣vember 6. 1670. so long it hath slept quietly, and should have slept on still, had it not been thus awaken'd; of which Discourse, I here present you a true Copy, not adding, not diminishing, not changing one word. If any man will shew me wherein I have erred, I will embrace him for a Friend, not forget∣ting that great St. Augustine hath his Retra∣ctations. God bless it to the Reader, so prayeth
