Right Honorable,
THere hath beene both in former Ages of the
Church, and also in these latter times, that
zealous desire and endevour in many wor∣thy
Divines to advance true Religion, and
to benefit the church of God, that they have
not onely by their assiduous preaching in
their life time wonne many soules to God, but also have left
divers monuments in writing, whereby they being dead, doe yet
speake: and the holy Doctrine by them taught is transmitted
and propagated to posterity after them. Amongst whom
Mr. John Smith, late Minister of Clavering in the Countie of
Essex, a man much reverenced for his Religion, Learning, Hu∣militie,
and Holinesse of life whilst he lived; whose memorie is
also very pretious with good men since his departure out of
this life: besides his indefatigable paines which he tooke in
dispensing faithfully the Word of life, did leave behinde him
certaine Treatises in writing, which in the judgement of some
godly men were like to prove profitable to the Church, but
because they were left by him not perfectly digested into or∣der,
as having no intention to present them to the publike
view (such was his Modestie and Humility;) therefore some
of his friends at the intreatie of me and my wife, the Relict of
the said M. Iohn Smith her former deare husband (having di∣rection

from us) have taken great paines to gather them to∣gether,
to make them readie for the light, which their indu∣strie,
as it was very acceptable to us, so we were very desirous
that the fruit thereof might redound unto many, and there∣fore
did cause commit them to the Presse, knowing that any
good the more it is communicated, the better it is. And this
Treatise containing the Summe of Faith, being (as it were) a
Christians free-hold, for which he ought to contend  an∣quam
pro aris & focis. We thought it not unworthy to present
unto your Honorable Patronage being an Orphan deprived
of its owne Father, hoping that by your Honours counte∣nance
and approbation, it shall the better bee accepted of all
true hearted Christians, and I was the more imboldned here∣unto,
because of your Honours zeale to true Religion, Re∣verence
the Word of God, Love and bountie to the faith∣full
and deserving Preachers thereof, Goodnesse towards all
men, Iustice and Equitie in the Common-wealths affaires, and
great Care of the good of your Countrie which is not onely
experimentally knowne to me (who am by many speciall In∣terests
obliged to your Honor) but also to all other in these
parts who are so happy as to have continuall proofe thereof.
And though this poore Posthume is permitted to venter
abroad naked (as it were) without those rich Robes, Orna∣ments,
and quotations wherewith the Father (if he had lived)
might plentifully have inriched it. Yet I most humbly crave
your Noble Protection for it, and favorable censure of both
the Worke and Publisher: so shall your Lordships Noble
favor herein yet further binde me,
