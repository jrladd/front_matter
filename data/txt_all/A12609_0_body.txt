MOst Reuerend father
in God, and my sin∣gular
good Lord: It
pleased your Grace
in the beginning of
Michaelmas terme last, to demand
of me a question touching the Bas∣saes
and Visiers belonging to the
Turkish Court, and whether the
chiefe Visier were promoted and
aduanced to that high & superemi∣nent
authority aboue the rest, accor¦ding





to his priority of time and an∣tiquity
of his being Bassa, or accor∣ding
to the good pleasure and elec∣tion
of the Graund Turke himselfe:
wherein although I did for the pre∣sent
satisfie your Grace to your con¦tentment
by the smal skill & know∣ledge
which I haue in those Turkish
affaires: yet bethinking my selfe of
this Discourse which hauing been
by me translated out of the Italian
tongue, had passed the Print, & had
lyen by me these two years not pub¦lished
to the viewe of this English
world, vpon some speciall conside∣rations,
that moued me for the time
to conceale the same. I thought it
would bee a very acceptable and
pleasing matter now to thrust it
forth, for the better satisfaction of
your Grace and others, that are de∣sirous





to vnderstand the ful truth &
estate of that tirannical and Maha∣meticall
Empire. The Booke was
written and penned by one Lazaro
Soranzo a Venetian Gentleman, in
the yeare 1598. at what time Maha¦met
the thirde of that name, now
raigning, was expected to haue en∣tended
warre vpon the State of
Christendome, eyther in his owne
persō, or by sending forth some one
of his Bassaes or Visiers to bee his
Generall in that action, whereupon
the Gentleman author of this Dis∣course,
beganne to enter into a very
deepe and subtle consideration of al
the designments & purposes which
the Turke and his Councell had
plotted at home, against the poore
distressed seuerall States & commō
wealths of the christian Empire: &





hauing performed the same did pub¦lish
it in print for the general plesure
& benefite both of his own country
and also of al others, that may haue
any interest in so waighty & impor∣tant
a busines: In which treatise if he
haue somewhat trespassed by terms
and wordes against the Caluinists,
the error will soone be pardoned, if
we shall remember that he is but a
relator of others opinions & speech∣es,
though himself indeed be great∣ly
addicted to the popish religion,
and the maintenance thereof. It
containeth first a perfect and true
discouery of the present estate,
wherin that Easterne Empire now
standeth, together with a speciall
report of the reuenewes and forces
thereof: secondly, the particular
discourses, that were made, where,





and vpon what parte of Christen∣dom
this war should be first attēp∣ted:
and thirdly a most christian &
resolute aduise giuen by the author
to all Christian Princes, how they
may cōbyne & confederate them¦selues
togither in this sacred war, &
be able euery way to meete withall
or any of these Turkish deuises &
plots, wheresoeuer & whensoeuer
they shall be put in practise, which
aduise I wold to God might deeply
and foundly sinke into the heartes
and mindes of all our western prin∣ces,
to the end they might ioyne
altogether with prayer and force to
eclipse that cressant Moone, being
now (I hope) at the full, and accor¦ding
to the Turkes owne fearefull
presages, as it is mentioned in the 83.
page of this little worke, like vtterly





to bee extinguished, whensoeuer
it shall please the Moderator of all
kingdomes to call away this present
fatall Mahamet, who dooth as yet
domineere in that vaste and huge
tyrannie. I was once minded (my
most gracious good Lord) to haue
added hereunto a more ample dis∣course
of the estate, forces and reue∣nues
of that Empire, comprehen∣ded
in a Treatise (entituled, Il Tur∣co
vincibile in Hongheria, viz. That
the Turke is vanquishible and to bee
ouerthrowne in Hungary) written by
an other Italian Gentleman, called
Achillis Tarducci of the Marqui∣sate
of Ancona. But the time pre∣uēted
me, so that I could not couple
them together, according to my de∣sire.
And therfore I most hūbly be∣seech
your Grace to accept of this





my poore trauell, being performed
by starts and at idle houres, which I
should & ought to haue employed
in your more serious seruices: not
doubting but that (if it shall please
God to adde any moe yeares to this
my Quinquagenarian yere of Iubile,
for which I most hartily thanke his
diuine Maiesty) I shal be hereafter,
if not more able, yet assuredly more
willing to discharge my dutie to
your Grace and my country, by do¦ing
some further seruice, that may
be pleasing & acceptable to any in∣differēt
reader. In the meane time, I
do hereby (as I am bound) wholy
deuote my selfe to your seruice, be∣seeching
the Almightie still to pre∣serue
& maintaine your Grace in al
health, honor, and happines, to the
continuation of the peace of this





English Church, and the comfort
of all your friendes and followers:
Among whome I must acknow∣ledge
myselfe, though the least
and the worst, yet in
all dutie and
affection.

At your Graces house in Lambhith,
the first of Ianuarie. 1603.
