HAuing (Right worshipfull) often heard of your ex∣traordinary
favour, shewed in the depth of extre∣mitie,
to some poore freindes of mine, remayning
in your pleasant Lordship of High-cleere: by
meanes whereof, they haue had no small comfort for the re∣couerie
of their wished desire: I haue been studious how I
might in some measure declare both their thankfulnesse and
mine owne for so great a good. But such  our weake abillity
that we cannot requite the least poynt of that life prolonging
kindnes, which the riches of your courtesie did yeeld: never∣thelesse
to make apparent, that our poore estates shall not ob∣scure,
or clowd with ingratitude, the well intending thoughts
of our hearts: I haue presumed to present to your worship
this little booke, an vnfaigned token of our good affection,
hoping that like the Princely Pertian you will more respect
the good will then the gift, which I confesse farre vnworthy
so worthy a Patron in respect of the simple handling of so ex∣cellent
a matter: But a playne stile doth best become plaine
truth, for a trifling fable hath most neede of a pleasant pen.
Wherefore if it shall please your Worship to esteeme of my
simple labour, and to let this passe vndr your favorable pro∣tection,
I shall haue the end of my desire. And resting
thus in hope of your worships courtesie I cease wi∣shing
you all hearts content in this life, and
in the world to come eternall felicitie.
