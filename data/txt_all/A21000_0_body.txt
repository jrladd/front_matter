RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
AS Man, who was created at first to the Jmage of God perfit∣ly, hauing breathed




 in his face the breath of life, in that earth∣ly Eden (and is now regenerate or created anew to the same I∣mage, albeit imper∣fectly; hauing brea∣thed in the face of his soule the breath of the life of grace in this spirituall Eden of Gods Church) doth
 Image-like heerein resemble God plaine∣ly, in respecting or de∣siring not so much ex∣ternal and eye-offices or offerings, as the in∣tegritie of affection and vnfained inter∣nall loue of the heart; which is the roote frō whence the fruit pro∣ceedes, the spring frō
 whence the streame doth flowe, the ground from whence the offi∣ces arise, and altar on which the oblation is made. And if the ground be found to be found, the spring seene cleare, the roote good, and the Altar cleane and vpright, albeit a mite of penurie bee
 cast in, or a drop of wa¦ter issue out, the one is more accepted then the superfluitie of plentie, and the o∣ther then a puddle O∣cean. Euen so like∣wise let your Ho∣nours adumbrate, type, and resemble the Image both of God & true Nobility herin,
 so to accept of this small gift, as being offered with a dueti∣full hand, proceeding also frō an affectionat and officious heart, and tending to the tē∣dring and encoura∣ging eies & hands of al vertue and piety, e∣uē your Honours, the patrons and patterns
 therof. So the God of al grace and glory, plēti∣full in the one, and all beutiful by the other, encrease the measure of his graces in you heer, and beautifie you also with the fulnes of his glorie heereafter.
