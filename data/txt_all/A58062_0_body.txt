SIR,
I Here present you with a Discourse on the Poems of Homer and Virgil, the most accomplish'd producti∣ons of Mans's wit in their kind, their excellency being such, that

they have been the delight and admiration of all after-ages, and the Models of all those who have since written upon the subject of Heroick Action.
As to the former, you know, Sir, what was said of him by A∣lexander the Great, that Kings gave their votes for him, when Hesiod had only those of the Pe∣santry: not to urge that Horace's eloge of him, when he said
— Nil molitur ineptè,
was certainly the greatest could be given an Author.
And as to Virgil, what can be imagin'd more remarkable,

than that the Romans, a Peo∣ple so intelligent, & such as num∣bred crowned Heads amongst their Subjects, should render him, one day, in the Theatre, the same honours which they were wont to render Augustus; ma∣king thereby a publick acknow∣ledgement of such a grandeur of Genius, in that admirable Per∣son, as they thought worthy the respects due to Scepters and Di∣adems?
How intimately Sir, you, are acquainted with these transcen∣dent Poets, all know that know you especially théy who reflect on

your recesses during the late un∣parallel'd Usurpations, when the envy'd ingenious had no other consolations, than those of Poesy and Philosophy. These observati∣ons of my Author will haply recal to your mind some your self had made on this subject, which, had not the distractions of those times smother'd them, might have prevented the present Addr¦esse of these to you, from,
SIR,
