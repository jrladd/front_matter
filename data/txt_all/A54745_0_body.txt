Bright Stars of Beauty,
INcouraged by your former inexpressible favors, I am at this time emboldned to prostrate these my Devoirs at your feet: after your Ladiships e∣gress from the Spring Garden, I was invited by the pleasure of the season, into the solitary reti∣redness of an Arbour, where in my Tale-book I intended to insert some slender Observations of those harmless Transactions and civil Frolicks, that had past betwixt you and your Servants, whose entertainments you had graced that eve∣ning with the serene influences of your propiti∣ous smiles. I had scarce for the recreation of my Genius, employed my pen to the draught of the first Character, when of a sudden from a shady Grove, I heard a mournful hollow sound, which at the first, I imagined to have been occasioned by some fresh gale of wind, that had only rustled among the trees, till ascertained otherwise by the iteration of a Heart-tearing groan: I was so far disturbed as to cast my eye of one side, where I soon discovered a woful weight; who by his me∣lancholly posture, and leaning of himself so dis∣contentedly against a tree, as if he supported it; I could not but with probability of reason at the the first sight determine, to be some wretched In∣amarato,

some Love-sick person; such an one whom the blinde God hath more fiercely woun∣ded, then the twelve signs of the Anatomy. A dismal object he was; and so represented to my view, as if his misfortune had ruined him so at once, as that he could not be rendred more unfor∣tunate; he lookt as if one of your Ladiships had whispered into his ear that doleful tune of Adieu, or at least that desperate sentence, Miscreant, thou shalt lie alone with thy bed unwarmed a score of frosty Winters. It cannot be amiss, by your Ladiships fair permissions, to draw the cur∣tain from before this Love Martyrs picture, to describe him to you, vultu, gestu, & oculis, just as I then found him suffering his ten Persecutions; his Hat in one place, with papers of Verses in a∣nother, were so fantastically dispersed on the ver∣dent Grass, that if he pleased, with his Feet he might spurn the wantonness of his own Muse: for I perceived by the baldness of his crown with scratching, that he had lately been delivered of Acrosticks and Encomiums; in praise of some of your Beauties. After the writing of which, for fear of a non acceptance, he was most pestilently dogged, and as I then found him, in such a sullen station, yet were not his eyes so set in the hollow∣nesses of his head, but that I discerned from them such diliberate and heavy motions, as caused me, had I not been convinced by the former symp∣tomes of his disease, to have suspected, whether otherwise, according to his education, he were not some Clown, who having mistaken the Al∣manack, wept for fair weather. Certain I am

that I saw a most pitiful object, one that I could not but conceive that his Mistress had frowned on, and he in requital thought for a foil, to shew her a worser face then her own. I protest to your Ladiships, after I had entertained my most serious thoughts of him, I could not but take him for such an unthrift, as had spent the best stock of wits in adoration of his Ladies Looking-glass; I approacht nearer to him; not Imagining but that he would at length have disimprisoned to his thoughts in some discourse; for indeed after a stricter surveigh of his presence, he seemed to me as if he indeavoured to hew and fashion out his conceptions to some purpose, though I am confident they proved as unprofitable to him, as an unfinisht piece of Artifice; what weight he poised in his Perricranium, I cannot well guess, but thus much I observed, that sometimes his head hung down to his breast, like the mon∣ster boys brother; till of a sudden he assumed more confirmed imaginations of his Mistresses kindness, which in an instant placed it again, and fixt it right, as it was before, on its own Pedestal; his face was scorcht with his Ladies eyes, as if he bin a three years voiage at the Indies, I am per∣swaded his very Soul was tanned, for beauty hath the same influence with the sun, it blacks within, as his brighter beams do burn without. Bless me from Cupid, O Mistress! thought I, give me a friend and good wine. But to proceed in my description, I vow to your Ladiships, he hath so strictly manacled himself, that his arms seemed pinnioned, like rabits feet to a spit, cros∣sed

like the strings of a book; in such a posture he showed, as if he had been all contemplation, no action; like a woful Jesuit, that had forsaken the world, so as never to rise from before his Cruci∣fix; one might have taken him for a statue, had not his sighs breathed from his heaved-up heart, a kind of a living death, which together with sudden startings caused a paleness sometimes to overcome the otherwise more dusky colour of his face, even so as that same time, to discover that in diebus illis, his cheeks had entertained some tell-tale blushes, and dimpled smiles. His afflictions were so merciful to him, that to my better apprehension his very tears were of a so∣vereign use, which as they then gusht forth, ser∣ved to quench those flames his Mistresses eyes had kindled, which otherwise would have scorcht him to ashes, and to this purpose I do be∣leive they did distil all the seasons of the year. I could not but laugh at the cloaths he wore, which were so far from A-la-mode, that I rather conceive he had mistaken one piece for another; as if he had put on his breeches for his doublet, the buttons wherof, were most of them off, for at every sigh that came from him, like Poppy∣heads, half a dozen of them dropt at a time. At this strange disguise of his habit, together with the further waggery of the blinde God, I could not but cry out, Fie, when I saw how his garters were tied in the wrong place, about his neck, as if he had received his Mittimus, and should want no accommodation for his journey to the Elizian fields, whither certainly his stragling thoughts had

already transported him; for he appeared to me, as if he dreamt waking of some business that con∣cerned another world. Alas cruel Fair Ones, de∣prived of your pitty, without my more oppor∣tune address, he had been for too much loving, your most unhappy Victim. When I first begun to break the silence of that place, where all things were as still as night, he heard me with his eyes, his ears followed his minde, which I perceived was not then at leasure, as he was at that time all things but himself; but having now at length recollected so much strength as to breath a few horse sighs, for as then he wanted other lan∣guage to speak his misfortunes, so desperately had this idolatrous Lover faln sick of his Goddess. At length after he had bestowed on me an angry nod, for the strangeness of my intrusion on the privacy of his thoughts, he started forth into an unusual kinde of furious madness, unclasping his arms, which before I suppose could never have been untwined, he fell to beating and thumping of his breast. I could not chuse at that time, but be merrily conceited, that this incensed rage of his, might arise from some displeasure he took, that his Invention could not presently teem with some Anagram, as fruitful as his Mistresses name. To be breif, I was amaz'd to think into how many strange shapes this Passion of Love transforms us, what Owls and Monkies it makes of us; in truth, the variety of antick tricks he played, to∣gether with the vain apparitions, that questionless at that time peopled his brain, rendred him to my thinking, the most unfit person that ever I

saw for any humane converse: I assure you, La∣dies, so monstrous and fatal to the most eminent Heroes of the world in all Ages, have the cruel∣ties of your implacable Sex proved. Not to de∣tain your Ladiships any longer with the descrip∣tion, of this distracted Lovers Herculian passions, by degrrees after he had a while held his hands, with a little chasing of his temples, stopping of his ears, tweaking of his nose, he came again to himself, and then crossing his breast, after a few lamentable Ay mee's he removed from the tree, into which, till then, I thought he had been in∣grafted. It was now night, whereof he was so sensible, as also of his late indisposition, that he requested my company with him out of the Gar∣den. As we walkt, I discoursed the strangeness of his distemper, for I durst not acknowledge his Love to be a disease, least I should have oc∣casioned his prejudice, so far, as for him to have esteemed it to have been incurable. We agreed to go to the Tavern, where, after we had lustily quaft the Blood of the Grape, I presented him with this Book of the Mysteries of Love, which, toge∣ther with clapping of warm trenchers to his Bel∣ly, so perfecty and speedily recovered him, that within a few dayes after I met him in Bloomes∣bury, with fresh Roses in his Cheeks, he lookt as if his Soul were returned to its right home a∣gain, probatum est. Thus have I given your fair Ladiships a large, but no Empirical, relation of the cure of this mad Lover, without either casting of his Urine, or any other Charms on his Mistress, except they are such as are contained

in this Book, the Witchcrafts of Eloquence, and the right Arts of Wooing; which as I hear, have since taken her Fort in, and that they are now happily married, I wish them all joy; only I thought fit in this my Epistle, to give your coy Ladiships notice, what vertue this Volume hath, to triumph over your most Beautiful Disdains; to turn your Frowns into Smiles; your Angers into Kisses; to repreive those whom you have de∣stined for most bloody Sacrafices; to metamor∣phose your Champion Cupid from a Boy to a Man, to give him his eyes again, peruse this Book, bright Ladies, and commend it to any of your modest Sex, that are troubled with the Green∣sickness of Love, they cannot fail of a Remedy, 'tis Diana's own Receipt Book. To conclude; I do not desire that either of the Sexes should take a∣ny tyrannous advantages over one anothers Af∣fections, neither would I bar them of their Fro∣licks; but that after the Youths have plaid a while at Bo-peep, lookt Babies in one anothers eyes, Hymen in his saffron robe, hath his torch light, may conduct them to their Marriage Beds: which is the hearty wish, and hath been the aim of these endeavours of your Ladiships
