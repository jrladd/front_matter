IF the many crosses and temptations, with which the life of all men, euen the most godly is distressed, b seriously weighed, and withall the great disconsola∣tion that too often surpriseth the hearts of most Christi∣ans, bee compassionately thought on: and if withall the singular glory of a godly mind framed vnto vnmoue∣able

rest, and stedfast con∣tentment, be throughly con∣ceiued of; it cannot but bee manifest, that if a way may bee shewed how a Christian may fill his heart with com∣fort in any condition hee can fall into, in respect of affli∣ction, that such a course is profitable, and all ought to take notice of it, and with all care & paines employ them∣selues about it. This by Gods assistance vpon apparent grounds of Scripture I haue endeuoured to shew in this Treatise, and doubt not but by experience humble and godly Christians will finde much refreshing and esta∣blishment of heart, if they apply themselues distinctly and diligently to draw of the water of life, out of those

wels of saluation, opened for them euery where in this role of Gods promises.
This Treatise I present to your Worships, & vnder the countenance of your names, desire to cōmend it vnto the Church of God: & this I am induced to do for diuers rea∣sons▪ your forwardnesse in the profession of sincere re∣ligion for many yeeres, the publike seruice you haue done in the Countrey in the administration of Iustice, for the incouragement of the good and reformation of a∣buses▪ your great care from time to time to plant painful & profitable teachers in the places of your abode, toge∣ther with the excellent gifts with which God hath fur∣nished your minds, deserue

to be freely & publikely ac∣knowledged in the Church of God; & in mine owne par∣ticular I haue beene so many wayes obliged, that with much gladnesse I embrace this occasion, to let the world know my desire to be thank∣full for the many helps & fur∣therances my ministery hath receiued from the counte∣nance and endeuours of both your Worships, as occasion h at any time bin offered. Desiring your acceptance hereof, and praying God to preserue you in his fear with∣out offence, till the day of Christ, and to enlarge in you the desire and power of wel∣doing in all things, I end and rest, Isleworth, Octo. 161.
