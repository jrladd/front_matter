MY LORD,
HAd I been so for∣tunate as to have brought your Lord∣ship somwhat equal unto you, that is to say, great, excellent, and worthy the eyes

of all Europe, I should not have need to begin this address with a prayer for pardon; which now I must needs do, since, my Lord, I only beseech you to be a tutelar Angel to a poor Or∣phan, whose Parents are un∣known, and which is like to perish, if not shelter'd by your Lordships shadow.
Those who have had the ho∣nour to converse with your Lordship, very well know how much, among your other ver∣tues, your Candor and huma∣nity are conspicuous, and what Goodness and Tenderness re∣sides in that high and noble Soul of yours, which makes you so universal a Patron to all liberal Studies, and a Fosterer

of every thing vertuous, ani∣mating and quickening the in∣ferior Bodies with that great Light which continually dwels in your own Sun.
And, my Lord, more parti∣cularly, since I fear you have that admirable defect of for∣getting the favors you confer, give me leave to put your Lord∣ship in mind of what you have done to me, both in doing me the honour to think I might be somewhat serviceable to you, as also in encouraging my poor studies; which having received warmth and life from your pro∣tection, bring this poor offering as the first fruits, which I be∣seech your Lordship to accept with the same easiness as that

great Prince did the hand-full of water, since it is the heart that proportions and estimates every gift. In the mean while, my Lord, I shall not cease, by my prayers and actions, to make appeare that high reve∣rence that I carry towards you; and though I be the meanest a∣mong your innumerable Ado∣rers, yet is there none more cordial, more fervent, more sin∣cere, then
My Lord,
