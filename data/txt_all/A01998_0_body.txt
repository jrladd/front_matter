PLutarke wryteth / whan Alexander had discō∣fyte Darius the kynge of Perse / amonge other iewels of the sayde kynges there was founde a curyous lyttell cheste of great value / whiche the noble kynge Alexander beholdynge / sayde: This same shall serue for Homere. whiche is noted for the great loue and fauour / that Alex∣ander had vnto lernynge. But this I thynke veryly / that his loue and fauour therto / was not so great as your gracis: whiche caused me / moost victorious / and most redoubted souerayne lorde / after I had printed this warke / to deuyse with my selfe / whether I myght be so bolde to presente your hyghnesse with one of them / and so in your gracis name putte them forthe. your moste hygh and most princely maieste abasshed and cleane discouraged me so to do / both bicause the present (as concernynge the va∣lue) was farre to symple / as me thought / and bycause it was none other wyse my acte / but as I toke some peyne to prynte it more correctly than it was before. And though I shulde saye / that it was not moche greatter peyne to that excellent clerke the morall Iohn̄ Gower to compyle the same noble warke / than it was to me to prynt it / no man wyll beleue it / without conferring both the printis / the olde and myn to gether. And as I stode in this basshement / I remembred your incomparable Clemency / the whiche / as I haue my selfe sometyme sene / moste graciously accepteth the sklender gyftes of small value / whiche your hyghnes perceyued were offred with great and louynge affection / and that not onely of the nobuls and great estates / but also of your meane subiectes: the whiche so mo∣che boldeth me agayne / that though I / of all other / am your mooste humble subiecte and seruaunt / yet my harte gyueth me / that your hygh∣nes / as ye are accustomed to do / woll of your moste benigne nature con∣sider / that I wold with as good wyl / if it were as wel in my power / gyue vnto your grace the most goodlyest and largest cite of all the worlde. And this more ouer I very wel knowe / that both the nobuls and commons of this your most noble royalme / shall the soner accepte this boke / the glad∣lyer rede it / and be the more diligent to marke and beare awey the morall doctrines of the same / whanne they shall se hit come forthe vnder your gracis name / whom they with all their very hartes so truely loue & drede / whom they knowe so excellently well lerned / whome they euer fynde so good / so iuste / and so gracious a prince. And who so euer in redynge of this warke / dothe consyder it well / shal fynde / that it is plentifully stuffed and fournysshed with manyfolde eloquent reasons / sharpe and quicke ar∣gumentes / and examples of great auctorite / perswadynge vnto vertue / 
 not onely taken out of the poetes / oratours / historywryters / and philo∣sophers / but also out of the holy scripture. There is to my dome / no man / but that he may bi reding of this warke get right great knowlege / as wel for the vnderstandyng of many & diuers autors / whose resons / sayenges / & histories are translated in to this warke / as for the plenty of englysshe wordes and vulgars / besyde the furtheraunce of the lyfe to vertue. whi∣che olde englysshe wordes and vulgars no wyse man / bycause of theyr antiquite / wyll throwe asyde. For the wryters of later dayes / the whiche beganne to loth and hate these olde bulgars / whan they them selfe wolde wryte in our englysshe tonge / were constrayned to brynge in / in their wri∣tynges / newe termes (as some calle them) whiche they borowed out of latyne frenche / and other langages / whiche caused / that they that vn∣derstode not those langages / from whens these newe vulgars are fette / coude not perceyue theyr wrytynges. And though our most allowed olde autors dydde otherwhyle vse to borowe of oher langages / eyther by∣cause of theyr metre / or elles for lacke of a feete englysshe worde / yet that ought not to be a president to vs / to heape them in / where as nedeth not / and where as we haue all redy wordes approued and receyued / of the same effecte and strength. The whiche if any man wante / let hym resorte to this worthy olde wryter Iohn̄ Gower / that shall as a lanterne gyue hym lyghte to wryte counnyngly / and to garnysshe his sentencis in our vulgar tonge. The whiche noble autour / I prostrate at your gra∣cis feete / most lowly present / and beseche your hyghnes / that it may go forthe vnder your gracis fauour. And I shal euer pray: God that is almyghtye preserue your royal maieste in mooste longe continuance of all welthe / honour / glorye / and grace infinite. Amen.
