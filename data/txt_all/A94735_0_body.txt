HOw tenacious the heart of man is of su∣perstition,
as former ages, so the present
generation doe abundantly declare. No
age can yeeld a more horrid instance of a
people taught so much as this Nation
hath beene concerning the true Worship
of God, admonished so often▪ that God is not pleased by hu∣mane
rites, and yet still place their Religion in them, oppugne
the representative Body of the Commonwealth, for seeking to
remove them, fight for them tanquam pro aris & focis,
spoyle their owne Countrey, with such cruell despight drive
away their faithfull teachers, and unspotted neighbours from
their dwellings, wives and children, and thinke it a good
worke to destroy them for not yeelding to practise things ne∣ver

appointed by God and notoriously tending to superstition,
and for their faithfull dealing with their soules in labouring
to draw them from their vaine confidence in the flesh to wor∣ship
God in the spirit, and to rejoyce in Christ Jesus. Hope
somewhat to abate this fire of rage, moved me at first to cast
this bucket of water to quench it. But as it happens often,
that when water quencheth not a fire, it flames out the more
by casting water on it: so it be fell me: the barbarous rage
and impetuous violence of people so increased, that I could
have no safety in my proper station, but was enforced to re∣move
my selfe, Wife and Children, and since have suffered
the spoyling of my goods, of my dwelling house, with many o∣ther
injuries. After much tossing up and downe, J have in
Your City cast anchor, till either a greater storme enforce me
to commit my selfe to the Maine againe, or a favourable gale
bring me into a Harbour. And that J may testifie my love
to this City, and gratitude for my present entertainment,
and withall aiming at your edification, J have presumed in
publishing this Sermon, to prefixe your Names, to whom J
humbly present it for your use and acceptance, and doe pro∣fesse
my selfe
