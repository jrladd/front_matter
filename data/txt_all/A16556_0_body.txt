I Finde three sundrie readings of the first words in the last Psalme; Praise God in vis Hieron. Augustin.  Saints, praise God in his Annymus and our old En∣glish translat. san∣ctitie, praise God in his Vatabius, Caluin, English Gene∣bib. & Ge∣sebr..rs ex Cl ald. San∣ctuarie. God is to be praised in his Saints, as hauing out of the riches of his mercie bestowed on them eminent gifts of grace, the which as their bequeathed . Imi∣en. him de S. maxim. legacies and onely true reliques are to be remem∣bred often in Gods Church vnto Gods people, that (as Ser. on Crist∣mas day prea∣hed at Bex∣terly. B. Latimer speakes) wee may worship the Saints in following their good ex∣amples.

And so these three lines meeting in one center, intimate that the most holy (being donor of euery good and perfect gift) ought to be magnified in his Sanctu∣arie for his sanctitie conferred vpon his Saints, whereby they shined as Philip. 1.1 lights in this heauen on earth, and now shine like D. 12.3. starres in heauen of heauen. For this end I haue begun, and I hope to finish an expo∣sition of the Festiuall Epistles and Gospels vsed in our English Liturgie. The which (howsoeuer herein I may seeme bold) yet am I bound to dedicate vnto your Grace for many re∣spectiue considerations, especially for this one, because your honourable disposition in the middest of a crooked nation is euer∣more to be both a patron and a paterne of vnfained sanctitie. Thus humbly besee∣ching the Lord to blesse, and your Grace to sauour these my labours; I rest
