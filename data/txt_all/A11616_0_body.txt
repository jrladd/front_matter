MOst dread So∣ueraigne. As your Maiestie (by due) haue the first place inter Omnes & Singulos, to whose Patrocinie this imma∣ture birth is dedicated, so by the Law you haue the chiefest interest in it.
I doe confesse, most Sa∣cred
 SIR, I haue borrow∣ed from the ouer-flowing Source of your Maiesties Princely and Learned , the best matter contained in it, and for satisfaction do hum∣bly offer restitution with some smal interest (although in a farre more base coyne.)
As your Maiesties knowne Clemencie, puts me in some hope of pardon, for my pre∣sumption, in borrowing the principall; so those eminent andParum est optare tantae Virtuti tantae{que} Pietati quem longissimum ha∣beat Vitae pro∣pressum: fac De∣us vt quod op∣timum human generi dedisti, permaneat in ae∣ternum: nam ne∣que laudes eius referre Vires suppetunt, neque paruum Carmen recipit tanta Maiestas, neque meus audet rem¦tentare Pudor, quam Ʋires fer∣re recusant: hoc tamen mihi asserere liceat prauum indig∣numque est, non admirari Prin∣cipm omni ad∣miratione dig∣nissimum. admired Kingly Ver∣tues, resident in your Roy∣all Person, make mee con∣fident, your Maiestie will rather accept of this super-plus (being worse then no∣thing) then reiect the mea∣nest offering that is conse∣crated
 (vpon the Altar of a dutifull and sincere affecti∣on) to your Maiesties ser∣uice; if, what I haue added, can onely yeeld vnto your Maiestie that Satifaction (whereof I much doubt) that anDauid in Ra∣dic. Mercer. Ignorant Arabian Woman did giue vnto the Learned Iewes Rabbies, who (by calling for a Broom or Besome) did bring them to the knowledge of an ob∣scure place in the Prophecie of Isaiah,Isa. 14.23. I shall thinke my Labours happie; and how∣soeuer (as I and all your Ma∣iesties Subiects, by the Sun∣shine of your happy gouern∣ment, are dutifully bound) I shall euer earnestly intreat the Almightie, that your Maiestie may continue long
 and prosperously to raigne ouer vs, and after Methusa∣lems age, by a happie ende may change your Earth∣ly Crowne with an∣other of endlesse Glorie.
