SIR,
MY Church-History was so far from prostiâˆ£tuting her Self to Mercenary Embraces, She did not at all Espouse any Particular Interest, but kept her self a Virgin.
However, a Dragon is risen up, with much Fiercenesse and fury, threatning this my Virgins destruction.
Your Name is GEORGE, and for you it is as easie as Honourable to protect Her from violence.
If any Material Falshood or Forgery be found in my Book, let LIAR be branded in my face: But oh! suffer not my Injured Innocence to be over-born in such things, which I have truly, clearly, and warily written.
Thus shall you encourage Me (leaving off such Controversal deviations from my Calling) to PREACH and to perform in my Ministerial function somewhat worthy of the Honour to be

Cranford Moat-house
March the 21th.
