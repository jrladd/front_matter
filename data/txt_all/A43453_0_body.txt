Honoured Sir,
I here Present you with what you were plea∣sed to call for at my hands; a Copy of that Discourse that was made at your Grand-Childs Funeral, which you were pleased so kindly to accept at the hearing, as to desire a more leisure∣ly perusal of it.
This is now the Third time, that I have been called to do you Service in these sad occasions, and Death hath made so many violent Inroads upon your Family in a short space.
I Pray God Almighty Sanctifie these sad Occurences to you, and to all that relate to you, and teach you to improve them to those purpo∣ses of Wisdom that he intends them.
If this poor Discourse may do you any Ser∣vice to this purpose, I shall have good cause to rejoyce. What ever it is, I present it to you in
 such a hope; if you have a design to make it publick (as you seem to intimate) you must be pleased to stand accountable for the imper∣fections of it, for I have no further concern for it, than to have it accepted as Testimony of thankfulness for those great kindnesses, you have been pleased upon all occasions to express towards.
Honoured Sir,

May the 8th. 1683.
