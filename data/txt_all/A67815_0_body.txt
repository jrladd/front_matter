May it please your Majesty,
TO revive the eternized and blessed Memo∣ry of your Royal Hus∣band andour now glori¦fied King, who lies em¦balmed with the me∣rits and blood of his undoubted Saviour
and Redeemer, by such an incompt and unwor∣thy pen as mine is, were cause sufficient to pull down the high displeasure of your Royal Majesty upon my self, and such pre∣sumptuous ones: But I do with all humility, supplicate your Ma∣jesties goodness and vertues, graciously to pardon this sinful
boldness of him who desires onely to imbel∣lish and set forth the unspotted innocence and admired patience of so divine a Martyr as he was; and with faithfulness and cou∣rage (maugre all dangers) to embla∣zen out the shame and malice of his undeser∣ved Enemies: So will my continual and in∣expressible
sufferings for his sake and inte∣rest be sweetned, my losses be repaired, and ny services sufficiently rewarded: they being but so many monu∣ments of duties per∣formed, and eviden∣ces of my incessant de∣sires and studies by al means to explicate my self
