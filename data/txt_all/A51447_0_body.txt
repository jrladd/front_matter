SIR,
SO few and precious is that number of the sons of wisdom, which the Creator (as so many Jewels) hath laid up in his Treasury from the beginning, for the a∣dornation of the World, as that more then one cannot be afforded to stand as a Golden Candlestick

for the holding forth that Lu∣cerna Dei to the sons of men, by the light whereof the most re∣clused Mysteries, both naturall and divine, may in some mea∣sure (such as is fit for us to know while we remain in these earthly tabernacles) be discove∣red to those diligent & humble seekers who make it their bu∣siness to search after the know∣ledge of the Creator in the works his hands have made.
That this was the principall end and design of the divine goodness in bestowing your selfe upon the world, we are fully convinced by those Scintilla∣tions which our eyes (dim as they are) have seen darted from

that uxor solis which hath its habitation in your breast: and although we should be frustrate of our ends in the present de∣sign, tis an happiness great enough that we have lived at such a time, and in such a place as hath given us the opportunity to know and be acquainted with a man in whose bosome God hath so abundantly stored up the treasures of all sorts of wisdom and knowledge. The main of our wishes are that we may so ac∣quit our selves as that you may hav no cause to repent of those kindnesses and respects where∣with you have or shall honour
