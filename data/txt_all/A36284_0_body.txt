Madams, fair Ladies, and Gentlewomen,
THere is a Proverb which saith, That some are wise, and some are otherwise: Whence I infer, that all men are not wise, but that there are some Fools in the world. The Provi∣dence of Nature was great, to chequer the world with such variety. For how could wisemen recreate their serious Contemplations, were not some men born to make them merry with their folly? I know, Ladies, you do not alwayes con∣template upon Brightman, alwayes read Love's Works; there is a time when you exhilarate your selves with looking on the labours of S. George, Palmerin of England, Bevis of South∣hampton, Don Quixot, and the like: Now had all the world been Plato's, Solon's, Calvin's
 and Calamy's, what would you have done for the merry humours of these men?
Therefore that I might no longer hide my light under a Bushel, but be useful in my Generation, and shew to the world that there was such a man as my self, upon Earth, I have here made bold to present you with the choicest Flowers of my Amorous Frolicks; and to set these my Ad∣ventures as so many Centinels to guard Melan∣choly from your thoughts.
If I have not acted my part so fully to my intentions, as I ought, upon the Stage of the World; Ladies, I beg your pardon, desiring you to tell me where I have fail'd, and to impose your further Commands upon,
Ladies,
