SIR,
I Hope you will pardon my Presumption in prefixing your Name to so small a Trifle. 'Tis the first Essay of a young Poet that has not yet reach'd his Twentieth Year; the first I mean that I have ventur'd to make Publick, and therefore having but little Experience to recommend me to the World, I make bold to chuse you for my Guardian during my Minority. The favourable Judg∣ment you've been pleas'd to make of some former Lines, makes me flatter my self that you will not be less Indulgent to these; and I am proud to make this publick Acknowledgement of the kind Reception I have met with from so great and worthy a Person; One who has vindicated the Reputation of the Muses from the Dis∣honour reflected on 'em by the loose Lives and Writings of some witty men, and has given the World a noble Instance that good Mo∣rals and good Poetry are very consistent. But I must not pro∣ceed; trifling Presents ought not to be usher'd in with much Ce∣remony. I shall only add, that in a Sense of the many Favours receiv'd from You, I shall always endeavour to approve my self,
Sir,
