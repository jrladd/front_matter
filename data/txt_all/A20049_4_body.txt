OVr Indian readinges, our Asian lectures, our Geographical description of the whole world, wyll I end with certayne reportes of the pro∣uince China in Cathayo, and some intelli∣gences of the worthy Ilands lying therby in the East Ocean. The relation whereof, though at the first myght seeme briefly to be passed ouer, and in a fewe substantiall poyntes only to be touched, as in the rest of our discourses concernyng this facultie we haue done: Yet the worthynesse of matter herein conteyned, the order of ci∣uile gouerment, the maners & fashions of the inhabiters, the dis∣cription of that countrey, so wel gathered the noueltie thereof in our language, haue effectually moued me to doo the whole discourse into Englysh. Needlesse I graunt the labour is for you, that perfectly in so few Monethes, so few weekes, so fewe dayes, learned the Italian tongue, out of the whiche language this translation is made. The singular care you euer haue had of my well dooyng, and the speciall fauour I haue founde among your Honorable frendes for your sake, vvoulde not only not let me to play the negligent Poete in the fift Act, but compelled me to handle euen the last Scene more a∣bundantly: aswel to acknowledge your good skill both in Cosmogra∣phie and in forreine languages, as also to testifie vnto the world, the great benefites the which I haue receyued for vschering, as it were herein, so good, so wyse, so vertuous, so worshipfull a mystres. Nowe after all these learned exercises of your younger yeeres, God Almyghtie send you great good successe in your present affaires, with encrease of prosperitie and muche honour, as you dayly shall grow elder.
