Christian Senators,
IT is now above twelve years since I Dedicated a larger Treatise to this Honourable Parliament, then full of pious Mem∣bers, and full of the Fa∣vour of God, and high esteem in the World; the most wise and powerfull Lord of Hosts, the God of all the Ar∣mies in the earth, having made you hopeful Conquerors over the Adverse Party, and given you power to establish the Nations upon the sure Foundation of Truth and Righteousness, and not
only to confirm the setled Mainte∣nance of the Ministers of the Gospel by Tythes, according to the Laws of the most wise God, and the most anci∣ent Law of this Nation, but to have in∣creased their Maintenance in those pla∣ces, where by that abominable Sacriledg of Antichrist, the Tythes were appro∣priated to Abbies, Monasteries, and such superstitious uses: and after most unjustly detained from the right Own∣ers, the particular Parish-Ministers, by King Henry the Eighth, and the Par∣liament that then consented to him for their alienation; by occasion of which; in divers thousands of Parishes, (even since the time of Reformation) poor ignorant, yea scandalous Ministers have been setled and continued, to the dishonour of God, our Religion, and succeeding Parliaments,
A light from Christ, leading unto Christ, Printed for John VVright, 1646. multitudes of Souls made ready to perish for lack of Knowledg (as they are in too many places at these dayes.) In the Epistle Dedicatory of that Book of mine pre∣sented unto you, I did complain of this miserable ignorance as a cause that such a multitude of poor blind Souls did run to the Kings Standard set up at Not∣tingham,
and joyn with that Army against the Parliament, which was a sad occasion the King did not return,
Humble Petition presented at York. al∣though he was most humbly Petitioned by multitudes of his most faithful Sub∣jects from several Counties in this Na∣tion, (which if it had been the will of God he had done) might by Gods bes∣sing have prevented those Rivers of Blood which have been shead in these intestine Wars: and for my own par∣ticular, have saved me from that most barbarous plundering of my house and Goods, in which I lost (with what is still owing me upon the Publick Faith & in other respects) above five hundred pounds, which I hoped I should have received before this, having the Engage∣ment of England and Scotland in print, that those who were plundered and lost their Estates for their faithfulness to the Parliament, and the Cause of God and the Nation then undertaken, and continued faithful, should have their Estates restored, and be recompenced to the full, or words to that effect; but when the Parliament was Dissolved, I gave up my hopes as dead; yet since God hath raised you from the Dead
again, and in his Providence brought you to sit here to perfect the good work was begun, I will not despair, but both I my self and others may find that Promise of both Nations made good to our comforts in time. And yet Right Honourable, my Spirits have not been a little troubled to hear and see a Gene∣ration of Seduced Souls, Quakers, Anabaptists, and others, cry out so bit∣terly against the Godly, faithful Mini∣sters of Christ in the Nation, as all An∣tichristians, to be destroyed, and their maintenance by Tythes to be taken away; Ye to see those inhumane, I am sure most unchristian abuses are still offered to too many of us till this day. I am afraid lest if the God of Heaven and Earth find it to be with England as it was with Israel, when the God of their Fathers sent to them by his Messengers rising up betimes,
2 Chro. 36, 15, 16. and sending, because he had compassion on his People, and on his dwelling-place: they mocked his Messengers, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets untill the wrath of the Lord arose against his peo∣ple, till there was no remedy: there∣fore he brought against them Forraign
Enemies to their destruction; the Lord pardon these our sins, and prevent those Judgements if it be his will;
Josh. 6. and I fear if Achans sin of Sacriledge, the taking away of Gods reserved part be found in England as it was in Israel, the punishment of Israel may befall us also, that our Army, as theirs, should fly before our enemies, and then how sad our condition may prove, none but God himself knows; to prevent this, to the best of my power, I make bold most humbly to present this little Treatise to your Honours, in which to the best of my understanding, Tythes are proved to be Gods Reserved part, and due to the Ministers of the Gospel by Divine right; and the unsetling of this antient Right may prove (I fear) the removing of a house built upon a Rock, and setting it upon the Sand, or a sandy Foundation, which may prove the ruine of the House, and of those that inhabit it. Upon my studying of this Question, had I found Tythes unlawful, or the Wages of Unrighteousnesse, as my Adversary-Anabaptists in their written paper sent to me did affirm, or Theft and Robbery as the Quakers; I hope
the Lord would have given me such a spirit of Contentment, that I should have chosen rather to have begged my Bread from door to door (as old as I am, now almost Threescore and Ten) ra∣ther than to have lived and dyed a Thief and a Robber, accursed of God and Good men. But as worthy Lu∣ther professed when he contested against the Popes Indulgencies, If any man can shew me a more firm and better way of Ministers maintenance, than by Tythes, which the Lord himself in his wisdom found out to be the fit∣test. I shall lye down in the Dust, and when my Conscience is satisfied, change my mind.
In the mean time not cease to pray the most Wise God to guide your Counsels, and prosper you in all your just and lawfull Endeavours, hoping of your Protection and encouragement for my self, and the rest of my Brethren the faithful Ministers of the Gospel, I most humbly Subscribe my self,
