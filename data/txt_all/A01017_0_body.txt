TO deriue my inducements (Right Honourable) of Dedicating these shallow Deseignes vnto a Mecae∣nas of such Supereminence, from Presidents of worthy witts and particular Obligees to eminent Patrons, my Fortunes haue not so auspiciously en∣deared me their happy Fauourite. But the Vniuersall concur∣rence of good Hearts with hearty zeale (from the Verge of a vaste extent) in the Center of true affectionated praise of your worth, and prayers for your weale, hath hasted & haled-on the whole Cur∣rent of my affections to runne with the Generall Concurse of vn∣fained welwillers, to congratulate your Lordships hopefull and hap∣pie Consolidations: For such and so manifold are those worthy Attributes of accomplished Amplitude and magnified Merits dimayning from the sacred Source of true Nobility, that they haue euen winged my feruent Desires, (more animated with self-approument of deuote sinceritie then amazed with myrrors of Magnificence) to the consecrating of these my prest Deseignemēts to your Honourable Patrocinie. But if such Motiues bee incompe∣tent to giue due Colour of excuse to Intrusions so exorbitant, I be∣seech

your Lordship giue me leaue to flee to the prostrate Plea of praying your gracious Indulgence for my rude Presume in daring from the remote Nadir of obscurity, to eleuate the flaggie Wing of so weake a Pineon towards the Zenith of Perfection, the mark and Pitch for Skie-towring Faulcons, whose Quills imped with strong Sarcells of the Grace of Greatnes, are inlisened and inhabled to transcende and climbe-aboue the mistie Vapours that cloude and Eclipse all Flights which peirce not to the Welkin of the Wor∣thies. For who sees not that Heroes (Gods Vice-gerents) can dig∣nifie euen the inglorious Groome, & giue such Glosse, and Tincture to home-made Statuaes, as shal attract the Eye of wonder to magni∣fie the potent Artists for refining & remoulding their (now) new creatures, as well as with the Touch-stone of refined knowledge de∣trud & banish all Deseignes, disfurnisht of true & due self-worth, from the Confines of high Repute? But least in labouring, with in∣vulgar Ingredients, to palate an ill seasoned Seruice, I should by te∣dious and vnrelished Tearmes, impart a worse distaste, I will screw-vp this Key with the prostrate sacring of my selfe and my poore Endeauours at the Shrine of your gracious Clemencie. And so euer wishing vnto your Honour the happie fruition of vnconfined Fe∣licity. I rest, now and euer,
London at the White Hart in Cheape-side,
Iunij. 6. 1610.
