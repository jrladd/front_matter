RAther then a Gentleman should by his owne patience and mo∣desty, suffer his bloud to bee thus hunted to the last drop (though for my own part I ne∣ver saw his face) yet having seen the transactions and prosecutions of his busi∣nesse, I shall write, not to contradict, provoke, contend with, or exasperate the pen of any, But to state the condition of a sentence and crime, in this coniuncture of time, when wee have so many: and to publish the excellent iustice of that honourable Court of War in its commen∣surate proceedings, according to the very letter and article of war, and the candid power of the Generall, and Supream of that Councell in re∣mitting the sentence upon iust and honourable grounds, as appears to him, and appears to me,

but am sorry the designe of Malignants should so secretly and cunningly, winde about the iudgment of some good men amongst us, un∣discerned, and unobserved of them, under the pretences of publicke service, reioycing in the dark, that they can put on our own party to prosecute one another, triumphing to them∣selves that they can make us lop off our owne branches, and act that upon our selves in their behalf, which they themselves cannot do upon us; But I here publish to the World, this is the grand artifice, and designe of the enemy abroad & now at this time, in this Kingdom, working in secret to make us the sad and fatall instru∣ments of undoing and destroying one another, and dashing our selves against our selves. But I hope wee shall discern and embrace one an∣other to the destruction of their Stratagem: Let us put on therefore as the elect of God, bowels of mercies▪ kindnesse, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, and above all, put on charity which is the bond of perfectnes. Col. 3. 12, 13, 14.
