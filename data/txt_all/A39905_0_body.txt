Gentlemen,
IF, (as it hath of late in like cases been customary) I should plead the Authority of your Court, as that which hath without any inclination of mine own, solely prevailed with me to print this Discourse; I must in∣genuously confess, it would be no o∣ther than a modester kinde of dissi∣mulation with you and the World.
For I must own, that when I de∣livered the substance of it from the Pulpit in two Sermons (the one at
 the Spittle before the Lord Maior then being, and the Aldermen of this City, on Wednesday in Easter∣week, 1672. and the other, which was but the former (at the Instance of some of you) repeated with some suitable enlargements, in your own Chappel of Bridewell at your late General Meeting, 1673.) I was not without thoughts of publishing it: because my principal Design in preaching it being (as in Duty I am bound, having by your favour been elected and hitherto continued Preacher to one of them) to pro∣mote the good of the two Hospitals under your Government; I justly con∣ceived that the more publick I made it, the more effectually it was like to answer my end.
Only I must withall acknowledge, that the general acceptance which it found from those of you that heard me in both Auditories, and the testification of your Desires (by an express Order of Court) to have it printed, concurring with mine own
 inclinations; gave me a great ad∣ditional encouragement to adven∣ture it thus to the publick View.
Concerning the success of which undertaking, I am not altogether out of hope that it may in some sort answer my desires; considering the serious Importance of the weighty Argument it handles, and the great suitableness of the matter contained in it, to the blowing up those few sparks of Charity, which (notwith∣standing these hard Times) remain yet unextinguished in the breasts of many worthy Citizens and others; into such Acts and Expressions, as the great Exigences of this City, and particularly, of these your Ho∣spitals, do require.
However, if my hopes of success upon others should unhappily fail me; yet I have reason to believe that my Endeavours herein will meet with a favourable acceptance and compliance from you, who have already given me so great a pledge of it, in commanding its publica∣tion.

I shall not farther enlarge this Dedicatory Address to you, be∣cause I shall thereby the longer de∣tain you from the Discourse it self; which I hope you had no other de∣sign in calling for, than that you might read and practise it, and thereby acquire that Blessedness to your selves unto which it directs. Which also, that you may obtain, is and shall be the constant Prayer of
(Right Worshipfull,)
