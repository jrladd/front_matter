RIght Noble Lords, with sorrow I beheld,
That which to write my duty hath compel'd,
And (from my pen) the Thames flow'd to the presse,
From thence it ebbes to you to finde redresse.
My Honourable Lord of Dorchester,
He truly noted in particular,
Dame Isis wrongs, and Thames great injuries,
For they were sad perspectiues to his eyes,
And had his Lordship liu'd his meaning was
To make the Riuer passable, to passe.

For then with noble care and deligence
He view'dthe helps, and the impediments,
Which aid, or hinder passage vp and downe,
Twixt Oxford City, and braue Windsr towne;
Yet as I sometimes row'd and sometimes str'd,
I view'd whe well, where ill the way appeard;
And here I haue desrib'd the way we went,
Commixing truth with honest merriment,
My thed-bare wit a mad wooll gathering goes,
To shew the things in verse I saw in prose;
And (Honourable Peres) I humbly craue,
My artless lines may your acceptance haue,
Wising each fault remou'd (which stnds vnfi)
As soone as you can reade what I haue writ,
Desiring God to giue yu high content
Here, and here fer glory permanent.

Humbly deuoted with his best endeuouts to all your Honourable personags,
IOHN TAYLOR.
