MY LORD,
IT may be thought that the frequent method of Dedica∣tions to Persons of Honour, now so much used, might be the occasion of this my Address to your Lordship; but I humbly conceive it most absolutely necessary for my Preservation, to flie to your Lordship for Protection and Relief: for the very Name of King's Evidence is now (by the subtilty of evil and guilty men) grown so obnoxious to many, that no man who hath the courage to appear for his King and Country against the Papists, can receive other Quar∣ter from many men, than that usually given to Rogues, Barra∣tors, or common Disturbers of the Peace of their Neighbours. But, my Lord, this Discovery now laid at your Lordships feet, is of a far different nature, and such which every good Christian and Subject is bound in Conscience to make for the good of his King and Country; and being no other than what hath been before the Lord Lieutenant and Council of that Kingdom in which your Honour did formerly reside as Chief Ruler under his Majesty, I therefore have made bold to dedicate these Pa∣pers to your Honour; you being acquainted with the Interests and Humours of that People, can best judge what Discourage∣ments such as appear for Protestancy and the English Interest lie under in that Kingdom: All persons favouring us there, are maliciously termed our Promoters. I do therefore humbly pray your Lordship to accept of this my poor Endeavour; which done, I shall not doubt its acceptance from all good men, and shall remain,
My Lord,
