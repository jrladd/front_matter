Honourable Sir,
THe Ensuing Discourse is not presen∣ted to your view, as a shape seen on the brow of a Hill, which faceth the Val∣ley of Essen; It's true, that cannot (as this) fall; that cannot (by the careles∣ness of Grooms) be set on fire; and there∣fore on that matter, to a Person of your Noble Birth and Retinue) one who con∣sidereth your merits, is obliged to recom∣mend to such, who may be entrusted with your Building; that Stables, and even Kitchens ought to be separated from the main body of a Palace, the Stable with∣out any question; in particular Mansion-Houses, the Kitchens may be so well dis∣posed, as that they may be at hand, and yet not be an anoyance, which made the

Honourable Sir,
