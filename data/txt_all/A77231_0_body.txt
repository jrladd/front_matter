I Have often seen it (honoured Freinds) in some ill made Sun-dials, where the Gnomon hath sloopt below the Elevation, that they have gone too fast in the morning, and as much too slow in the after∣noon: which as it may fitly be applied to some, that being too quick, and ripe witted in their younger time, prove often lesse eminent in their elder: So also to the favour and freindship of this world, which in the first setting out, a car∣ceribus, is very quick and fleet (primus impetus major quam virorum) but in the progresse, rather than hastie, ad metam, is sluggish and dull enough. No one thing so soon runs it selfe out of breath, as that doth. The solid cause whereof, I take to be this, because it is not solid: and this again, because too many enter such relation, for their own private ends; the vertue it selfe not being their end, but their own self-ends all their ver∣tue; which when they cannot effect, they cease to affect; Like Trumpeters that fill their circumflect Instruments with their breath, that they may fill by a like circumflect reciprocation their eare with the sound. But as for you (worthy freinds) your

 need. But then as it is with wine and all such liquors, they are best kept when they are kept close and covered, so it is with deeds of Charitie, which must needs prove flat and dead, when by our selves vent is given to them, or they uncovered.
No more at present, but let it be your endeavour to fol∣low him as he followed GOD: And the Lord grant to you all your Fathers Blessings, and adde thereto. The cordial prayer of
