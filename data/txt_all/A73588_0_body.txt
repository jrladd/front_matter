AFter the particuler thinges allea∣ged in my former writings vnto your Lordshippe, I thought it good and conuenient by this my Letter, to aduertise your Lord∣ship, of certaine great, horrible, and fearefull things that hapned in this quarter.
Purposing to certifie your Lordship of the pompe and great triumph at the presenting of the Captaines of the Sea, vnto the great Turke: the miserie and vn∣happines of the poore prisoners: the discorde & con∣tention that came by the sonne of the Vice Roy of Naples, being prisoner: the threatnings made to the Christians: the receiuing of the Ambassadors of the Soffy: the pompes, tryumphes, and entertainments made vnto them, and yet dissembled enough, with mocking one the other at their departing: the pre∣sents giuen: the going of the great Turke a hunting,
and all other thinges written at large, as your Lord∣ship shall vnderstand.
But now your Lordship shall vnderstand at thys time, the greatest, the most wonderfull, and most strange thing that euer was heard of. The which partly hath so troubled the great Turke, and all the rest, that they haue left of all other affayres, to pro∣uide for the perrill and danger that at this time hang∣eth ouer theyr heads.
