Right Honourable, right Worshipfull, and Worshipfull:
AS the case stands with a man and the parts of his body; so it may fall out with a Citie and the members of it; one part is the princi∣pall in the Act, and another in that re∣nowne, which redoundeth from that Act: yet the man himselfe, as is due, bea∣reth away the glory of the deserued
praise. The hand by the Mercurialists Penne, or Martiall Pike, sets a wreath, as the embleme of worthinesse, vpon the head only; yet blazeth the Fame of the whole man. A worthy Gouernour a∣mong you, my much respected friend, (whose name, when euery BRANCH shall beare a particular name, another BRANCH, if God permit, shall men∣tion) as it is not vnknowne, not onely himselfe shewed me a fauour, but tooke order with his successor in his place, that that storme which did threaten my ruine, should not with that violence, which was intended, fall vpon me, if a chearing calme should not come be∣tweene, which by Gods prouidence and his meanes came to passe. Sensible yet of that fauor and other curtesies which I haue receiued from, and perceiued in diuers of you, in the good intentions of some, endeuours of other, wel-wish∣ing of many, I haue aduentured to pre∣sent to your eies part of that which sometime sounded in some of your
eares, as they especially can witnesse who were the Lords instruments to manifest his care, in preuenting the violent course of some who would haue wrongfully enthralled my freedome, and damned vp the streames of my iust and legall proceedings, yet so as my thankfulnesse is made knowne vnder the name of your honourable citie, my Text casting a fauourable countenance that way, and referreth its entertaine∣ment to your kindnesses. Now goe on (right worthy) as the Lord shall minister occasion, and your seuerall places call for, in Christian and charitable actions, for such haue carried your cities and predecessors fame beyond the Ocean, and assuredly God himselfe will not for∣get (though those who haue felt the be∣nefit should be (which God forbid) vn∣mindfull of) your works of either pietie or pittie: & for my selfe my tongue and penne shall not cease to afford you moe dishes of fruit, as Testimonies of my gratefull heart, if the Lord be pleased to
prosper my endeuours about the roote of this GRAFT. In the meane season I shall not cease by my prayers to la∣bour to draw from the fountaine of all goodnesse, all needfull blessings for your whole city and all in it, from the highest Cedar to the lowest Shrub, and euer rest,
