THis Question, SIR,
Concerning your
Majesties Preroga∣tive
in laying Im∣positions
upō Mer∣chandizes,
ought not to have
been made or moved at all; how∣beit,
it hath been stirred and de∣bated

in Parliament, it is now
become an Argument of such
Dignity and Importance, as the
best-able amongst your Servants
learned in the Law, may well im∣ploy
their best learning in the
discussing thereof. For my part,
though I find myself unable to
handle this Noble Question, as
the weight and worthinesse re∣quireth;
yet have I upon sundry
occasions arising from the course
of my service, collected such
notes, and drawn together such
materials, as may be of use in the
building of a Fortresse in the de∣fence
of this Prerogative; and
sure I am, that if your Majestie
will vouchsafe to cast your eye
upon these Collections, that your
Judgment will make a far better
use and application thereof, than

I who have gathered the same,
can posible do; these little sparks
of knowledge being taken into
your Majesties consideration, wil
instantly multiply and arise into
a flame, and so give a great light
for clearing of this Question:
This learning within my hand, is
but a Spade, in your Majesties
hand will become a Scepter. I
have onely like the poor Indian,
digged up the Oare of Mine,
which being brought into the
Kings Mint, and refined there,
becomes part of the royall Trea∣sure.
For the Argument it self, it
will hardly receive any Orna∣ment,
Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta
doceri.
The best light I can give it, is

Lucidws ordo, by breaking it into
Capita rerum, and casting it into a
plain and naturall method; it is
somewhat long, and in Multilo∣quio
non deest peccatum, saith Solo∣mon;
it is also mixt with some rea∣sons
of State, wherein a common
Lawyer may easily make a Solae∣cism;
yet such as it is, my zeal to
advance your Majesties Service
hath moved me to present it to
your Majesty, with all humble∣ness,
and with some hope, that
this dutifull pains shall purchase
a pardon for the errours therein
committed,
By your Majesties un∣profitable
Servant
and humble Sub∣ject,
