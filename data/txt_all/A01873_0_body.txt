RIght Honourable, I am in a great straite, betwixt hope and dispaire standing, your worthines and wis∣dome to trouble with such an vn∣worthy labour as this is; for which my ambitious and bolde presumpti∣on, I stand at the Barre of your lear∣ned Iudgement, and deeme to bee arraigned, conuicted, and adiudged of the same. But my hearty desire of the welfare of our now florishing Hierusalem, and her In∣habitants, which I pray God long it may so continue, & vn∣fained zeale, thereunto is constrained thus to breake foorth, thus to proclaime vnto all her dwellers therein, your great mercy to distressed soules, desiring to comfort them, & by all meanes possible to saue them, aswel as your Iustice & zeale to punish and cut of offenders: both which to be conioyned to∣gether in your Noble heart, of late are expressed, In sending to a perplexed and distressed soule, when time of neede did greatly require the same (phisicke) by that heauenly Phisiti∣on, and Messenger of God Mr. Robert Pricket, into whose Industrious labour and haruest, I was bolde to intrude my

selfe, and thrust in my sickle. And now further desirous to explaine vnto the world, the good successe and blessing that God in his great mercy gaue to our willing labours: Hum∣bly crauing your Honours patronage and acceptance, which if your Hon▪ vouchsafe to graunt, will incourage vs to be at your Hon: command in the like seruice. And being sheltred vnder your fauourable countenance and acceptance, wil make both the cause & help of our Ministrie, respectiuely regarded and welcome, to whome wee shall be called. And this La∣bour now published, & conuayed, my only ayme & intent by dispersing of it, is to vestigiate your Hon: steps, to wish & en∣deauour the generall good of all, & particular hurt of none: The Lord Almighty of his great goodnesse long continue your Hon: amongst his people for their welfare, to be as e∣uer your Religious courses haue explained, to be Noble, cha∣ritable, and Religious, a defence to such as else would be op∣pressed, and an incourager of the good and vertuous.
