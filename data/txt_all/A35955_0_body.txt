MADAM,
AFter the Author had written and
published this Treatise in Latine,
for the use of young Students in
Theology; by the earnest and
frequent entreaty of friends, he was induced
and perswaded to translate it into our vulgar
Tongue, for the benefit of these who understood
not the Latine; and for preventing the la∣bour
of others, who, more forward then skil∣full,
were about the doing of it, and had once
so far proceeded, as to offer it to the Press,
without acquainting him therewith.
When he had finished the Translation, his
purpose was to have dedicated it to your Lady∣ship,
and to have sent it abroad into the world
under your protection: but weakness and sick∣ness,
the ordinary companions of age, and after
them, death (whereby God Almighty and

Gracious, called him from his labours to enter
into his Master's joy) seasing upon him, be∣fore
he could write an Epistle Dedicatory, it
was his will, that your honourable Name should
be prefixed unto it. In pursuance whereof, it
comes now, as an Orphan, to kiss your noble
Hands, fraughted with hopes of favour and
shelter for the Parent's sake, and of acceptance,
as a testimony of the sincerity of the respects
he carried to your Ladyships vertues.
It hath the stronger plea for a tender recep∣tion,
that it is the child of his age, being his
last labour, and being brought forth in his
seventy and second year; and that it comes
arrayed in a sute of Country-cloath, which
himself put upon it, being published according
to the Copy written with his own hand.
That it may be, as it was designed by him,
usefull for the good of souls, and that God may
comfort you under your present sad affliction,
and make up the loss of your noble Husband,
the late Lord high Chancellour of Scotland,
is the prayer of,
MADAM,

Edinburg▪ 13. Iune,
1664.
