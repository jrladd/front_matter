BEeing earnestlye re∣quested, and often intreated (Righte wor∣shippefull) by manye of my good friendes, to putte in printe this small Treatise of the Generall day of doome, which I lately preached, and in publike place deliue∣red:

I haue (being ouercome with their perswasions) condescended to their ear∣nest demaund, although very vnapt and exceedingly vnworthy for the pen∣ning of so worthy a matter. Wherefore I haue made choyse (crauing pardō for my presumption herein) of your well disposed worship at this time (being the Alpha of my tender and slender ende∣uours) to sound in your sacred cares this last and generall trumpet, & to dedi∣cate to your worship the same: both in regard of the demonstration of my true vnfamed, and lasting thankfulnesse to your benigne worship, (for saith Se∣neca: Beneficium hominem gratū semper delectat, ingratum semel: id est: A thankfull man will alway re∣member a benefit, but an vnthankfull person wil soone forget it) for your ex∣traordinary Kindnesses bestowed vpō me, Absque vllo demerito, without any desert in the world: as also in regard

of the greate affection, good deuo∣tion, and thrice welcom entertainment you beare to diuine and spiritual trac∣tates which appertain to the euerlasting blisse of the soule, accounting thē bles∣sed which bring glad tidings of salua∣tion. I desire therfore (idque more humillimo, in most submissiue māner) this one thing at your worships hand, that you would (pardoning my bold∣nesse) vouchsafe, aequi bonique consulere, to take in good worth this simple and slender gift. Which thing if your worship shall vouchsafe to doe, it shall not onely be an incouragement to my future proceedings, but also it shall be vinculum in dissolubile, an inuin∣cible bond to tie me in all duty, & in al loue to your worship: dum memor ip∣se mei, dū spiritus hos regit artus: so lōg as life shal last. Thus hūbly taking my leaue of your good worships (nothing doubting of the goodnes of your natures

in the acceptāce of these my first presē∣ted fruits) I cōmit you with yours to the safe protection of the almighty, alwaies begging before the throne of his moste glorious Maiesty, that he would in this life, infuse his holy spirit with all his graces into your heartes aboundantly, and in the worlde to come, crowne you with the crowne of immortall glory, & that for Christ Iesus his sake, our Lord and only Sauiour, Amē. From Samp∣ford Magna in Essex, this 30. of Aprill. 1606.
