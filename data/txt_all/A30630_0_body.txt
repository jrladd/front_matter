SIR,
I Take the Liberty of ma∣king a Present of the following
Essay unto you, as to a Person who being ac∣knowledged
by all the Learn∣ed World for one of the Greatest Masters of Reason, are therewithal allowed a most Proper and Competent Judge of any Discourse concerning it. Whatever my Performance is, the Design I have is no small one; since it is to show the true way of Humane Knowledge, and by shewing that it is REAL NOTIONAL, to unite and reconcile the Expe∣rimental, or Mechanical, with the Scholastical Me∣thod. This Thought, Sir, af∣fords me abundant matter of enlarging in many others; but I ought to remember, that I am
a stranger to you, and this my First Visit, and therefore I must make it short, which I will do, by hastning to own my self among the Croud of those who do admire you, and to as∣sure you, that I am with great Respect,
SIR,
