MY LORD,
WHEN we make Books and publish them, and by Dedications implore the Patronage of some worthy person, I find by experience that we can∣not acquire that end which is pretended to by such addresses: For neither friendship nor power, in∣terest, or favour, can give those defences to a Book, which it needs: Because the evil fortune of Books comes from causes dis∣cernible indeed, but irremediable; and the breath of the people is like the voice of an exterminating Angel, not so killing but so se∣cret; but that's not all; it is also as contingent as the smiles of an Infant, or the fall of a Die, which is determined by every part of motion which can be in any part of the hand or arm. For when I consider that the infinite variety of understandings is greater than that of faces, not only because the lines that make our faces are fi∣nite, but the things that integrate and actuate the Vnderstanding are not; but also because every man hath a face, but every man hath not Vnderstanding; and men with their understandings or with their no understandings give their sentence upon Books, not only be∣fore they understand all, not only before they read all, but before they read three Pages, receiving their information from humour or

interest, from chance or mistake, from him that reads in malice, or from him that reads after dinner; I find it necessary that he that writes should secure himself and his own reputation by all the ways of prudence and religion; that God who takes care of fame as cer∣tainly as of lives may do that which is best in this instance; for no other Patron can defend him that writes from him that reads, and understands either too much or too little: And therefore, my Lord, I could not chuse you to be the Patron of my Book, upon hopes you can by greatness or interest secure it against the stings of insects and imperfect creatures; nothing but Domitian's style can make them harmless; but I can from your wisdom and your learning, the great reputation you have abroad, and the honour you have at home, hope that for the relation-sake some will be civil to it, at least until they read it, and then I give them leave to do what they please, for I am secure enough in all this; because my writings are not intended as a stratagem for noises; I intend to do not only what is good, but what is best; and therefore I am not troubled at any event, so I may but justly hope that God is glorified in the ministration: But he that seeks any thing but Gods service, shall have such a reward as will do him no good.
But finding nothing reasonable in the expectation that the Dedi∣cation should defend the Book, and that the gate should be a fortifi∣cation to the house, I have sometimes believed that most men intend it to other purposes than this, and that because they design or hope to themselves (at least at second hand) an artificial immortality, they would also adopt their Patron or their friend into a participa∣tion of it; doing as the Caesars did, who taking a partner to the Empire, did not divide the honour or the power but the ministration: But in this also I find that this address to your Lordship must be de∣stitute of any material event, not only because you have secur'd to your self a great name in all the registers of Honour by your skill and love to all things that are excellent, but because of all men in the world I am the unfittest to speak those great things of your Lordship which your worthiness must challenge of all that know you. For though I was wooed to love and honour you by the beauties of your vertue, and the sweetness of your disposition, by your worthy imployments at Court, and your being so beloved in your Coun∣try, by the value your friends put upon you, and the regard that strangers paid to you, by your zeal for the Church, and your

busie care in the promoting all worthy learnings, by your Religion and your Nobleness; yet when I once came into a conversation with these excellencies, I found from your Lordship not only the example of so many vertues, but the expressions of so many favours and kind∣nesses to my person, that I became too much interested to look upon you with indifferency, and too much convinced of your worthiness to speak of it temperately; and therefore I resolve to keep where I am, and to love and enjoy what I am so unfit to publish and express.
But My Lord, give me leave to account to you concerning the present Collection; and I shall no otherwise trouble your Lordship than I do almost every day when my good fortune allows me the com∣fort and advantages of your Conversation. The former Impressions of these Books being spent, and the world being willing enough to receive more of them, it was thought fit to draw into one Volume all these lesser Books which at several times were made publick, and which by some collateral improvements they were to receive now from me might do some more advantages to one another, and better struggle with such prejudices with which any of them hath been at any time troubled. For though I have great reason to adore the goodness of GOD in giving that success to my labours, that I am also obliged to the kindness of men for their friendly acceptance of them; yet when a persecution did arise against the Church of Eng∣land, and that I intended to make a defensative for my Brethren and my self, by pleading for a liberty to our Consciences to perse∣vere in that profession which was warranted by all the laws of GOD and our Superiours, some men were angry and would not be safe that way, because I had made the roof of the Sanctuary so wide that more might be sheltered under it than they had a mind should be sav'd harmless; Men would be safe alone or not at all, supposing that their truth and good cause was warranty enough to preserve it self; and they thought true; it was indeed warranty enough against persecution, if men had believed it to be truth; but because we were fallen under the power of our worst enemies (for Brethren turn'd enemies are ever the most implacable) they looked upon us as men in misperswasion, and error; and therefore I was to defend our per∣sons, that whether our cause were right or wrong (for it would be supposed wrong) yet we might be permitted in liberty and impunity: but then the Consequent would be this, that if we when we were sup∣posed to be in error were yet to be indemnified, then others also whom

we thought as ill of were to rejoyce in the same freedom, because this equality is the great instrument of justice, and if we would not do to others as we desir'd should be done to us, we were no more to pretend Religion, because we destroy the Law and the Prophets. Of this some men were impatient; and they would have all the world spare them, and yet they would spare no body. But because this is too unreasonable, I need no excuse for my speaking to other purposes. Others complain'd that it would have evil effects, and all Heresies would enter at the gate of toleration; and because I knew that they would croud and throng in as far as they could, I placed such guards and restraints there as might keep out all unreasonable pretenders; allowing none to enter here that speak against the Apostles Creed, or weakened the hands of Government, or were enemies to good life.
But the most complain'd, that in my ways to perswade a tolerati∣on, I helped some men too far, and that I arm'd the Anabaptists with swords instead of shields, with a power to offend us, besides the proper defensatives of their own. To this I shall need no reply but this; I was to say what I could to make their persons safe, by shewing how probably they were deceived; and they who thought it too much, had either too little confidence, or too little knowledge of the goodness of their own cause; and yet if any one made ill use of it, it was more than I allowed or intended to him, but so all kindness may be abused: But if a Criminal be allowed Counsel, he would be scorned if he should avow his Advocate as a real Patron of his crime, when he only says what he can to alleviate the Sentence. But wise men un∣derstand the thing and are satisfied; but because all men are not of equal strength; I did not only in a Discourse on purpose demon∣strate the true doctrine in that question, but I have now in this Edi∣tion of that Book answered all their pretensions, not only fearing lest some be hurt with their offensive arms, but lest others, like Tar∣peia the Roman Lady, be oppressed with shields, and be brought to think well of their Cause by my pleading for their persons.
And now (My Lord) I have done all that I can do, or can be desired, only I cannot repent me of speaking truth, or doing charity; but when the loyns of the Presbytery did lie heavy upon us, and were like to crush us into flatness and death, I ought not to have been reproached for standing under the ruine, and endeavour∣ing

to defend my Brethren; and if I had strain'd his arm whom I was lifting up from drowning, he should have deplor'd his own neces∣sity and not have reproved my charity; if I say I had been too zealous to preserve them whom I ought to love so zealously.
But I have been told, that my Discourse of Episcopacy relying so much upon the Authority of Fathers and Councils, whose autho∣rity I so much diminish in my Liberty of Prophesying, I seem to pull down with one hand what I build with the other: To these men I am used to answer, that they ought not to wonder to see a man pull down his Out-houses to save his Father and his Chil∣dren from the flames; and therefore if I had wholly destroyed the Topick of Ecclesiastical Antiquity, which is but an out∣ward Guard to Episcopacy to preserve the whole Ecclesiastical or∣der; I might have been too zealous, but in no other account culpable: But my Lord, I have done nothing of this as they mi∣stake.
For Episcopacy relies not upon the Authority of Fathers and Councils, but upon Scripture, upon the institution of Christ, or the institution of the Apostles, upon an universal Tradition, and an universal practice, not upon the words and opinions of the Doctors; It hath as great a testimony as Scripture it self hath; and it is such a government as although every thing in Antiquity does minister to it, and illustrate or confirm it; yet since it was before the Fathers and Councils, and was in full power before they had a being, and they were made up of Bishops for the most part, they can give no authority to themselves, as a body does not beget it self, or give strength to that from whence themselves had war∣ranty, integrity and constitution. We bring the sayings of the Fathers in behalf of Episcopacy, because the reputation they have justly purchased from posterity prevails with some, and their rea∣son with others, and their practice with very many; and the pre∣tensions of the adversaries are too weak to withstand that strength; But that Episcopacy derives from a higher Fountain appears by the Justifications of it against them who value not what the Fathers say. But now, he that says that Episcopacy besides all its own proper grounds hath also the witness of Antiquity to have descended from Christ and his Apostles; and he that says that in Questions of Religion the Sayings of the Fathers alone is no demonstration

of Faith, does not speak things contradictory. He that says that we may dissent from the Fathers when we have a reason greater than that authority, does no way oppose him that says, you ought not to dissent from what they say, when you have no reason great enough to out-weigh it: He that says the words of the Fathers are not suffici∣ent to determine a nice Question, stands not against him who says they are excellent Corroboratives in a Question already determined and practised accordingly. He that says the Sayings of Fathers are no demonstration in a Question may say true, and yet he that says it is a degree of probability may say true too. He that says they are not our Masters speaks consonantly to the words of Christ; but he that denies them to be good Instructors does not speak agreeably to reason or to the sence of the Church. Sometimes they are excellent Arbitrators, but not always good Judges; In matters of Fact they are excellent Witnesses; In matters of Right or Question they are rare Doctors, and because they bring good Arguments are to be va∣lued accordingly; and he that considers these things will find that Ecclesiastical Antiquity can give very great assistances to Episcopal Government, and yet be no warranty for Tyrannical; and al∣though even the Sayings of the Fathers is greater warranty for Epi∣scopacy, and weighs more than all that can be said against it; Yet from thence nothing can be drawn to warrant to any man an Empire over Consciences; and therefore as the probability of it can be used to one effect, so the fallibility of it is also of use to another; but yet even of this no man is to make any use in general, but when he hath a necessity and a greater reason in the particular; and I therefore have joyn'd these two Books in one Volume, because they differ not at all in the design, nor in the real purposes to which by their variety they minister.
I will not pretend to any special reason of the inserting any of the other Books into this Volume; it is the design of my Bookseller to bring all that he can into a like Volume; excepting only some Books of devotion, which in a lesser Volume are more fit for use. As for the Doctrine and Practice of Repentance, which because I sup∣pose it may so much contribute to the interest of a good life, and is of so great and so necessary consideration to every person that desires to be instructed in the way of godliness, and would assure his salvation by all means; I was willing to publish it first in the lesser Volume, that men might not by the encreasing price of a larger be hindred

from doing themselves the greatest good to which I can minister; which I humbly suppose to be done, I am sure I intended to have done in that Book.
And now, my Lord, I humbly desire, that although the pre∣senting this Volume to your Lordship can neither promote that honour which is and ought to be the greatest, and is by the advantages of your worthiness already made publick, nor obtain to it self any secu∣rity or defence from any injury to which without remedy it must be exposed, yet if you please to expound it as a testimony of that great value I have for you, though this signification is too little for it, yet I shall be at ease a while till I can converse with your Lordship by something more proportionable to those greatest regards which you have merited of mankind; but more especially of,
My Lord,
