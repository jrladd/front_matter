Reverend Brethren,
THis Discourse, when pronounc'd before our most Excellent Diocesan, had the Happiness to meet with so great an Approbation from you, that even in that re∣spect you might have challeng'd its first appearing in the World: But by your unanimous Application to His Lordship, that he would be pleas'd to command me to make it publick, it became entirely your own; and I could not without Injustice look for any other, or safer Patronage, than that of so many wise and learned Men, who did me the Honour to desire its Publication.
But there is also a great mixture of Gratitude in the Of∣fer which I humbly make to you of it. I am glad of so publick an Opportunity to express to you the deep Sence which I have of your repeated Favours to my Parish, which for four Years last past you have honour'd with a Lecture, wherein you propos'd to your selves no other Encouragement but that of doing Good; your pious Endeavours being like Vertue, which is a Reward to it self, and is abundantly satisfy'd if it can but advance the Great Ends of Religion I am,
Reverend Brethren,
