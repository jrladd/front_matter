My Lord,
THough the Acceptance, this plain Discourse has met with, among those that honour the King and love the Church in the place where 'twas Preached, be a slender Excuse for exposing so very slender a Performance to the Censure of the World; yet I am conscious to my self, I should deserve to be more censured, and have much less to excuse me, if having ventured upon this occasion to appear in publick, I should not take the Opportunity to make my Acknowledgment of your Lordships Favours to the Author, as publick as the Discourse.
I am not so vain to crave your Lordships Patronage, for what I know to be so unworthy of your Lordships View: Nor do I make this Address to court your Ap∣probation of a Sermon, too mean for so great a Judg∣ment, as your Lordships to Approve; being Composed only for a Vulgar Auditory, and it self too vulgar even for that: But the design of it, how weakly soever mana∣ged,
being to promote Piety to God, and Loyalty to the King, Obedience and Gratitude to both, I am willing to hope, your Lordship, who are your Self so Eminent an Ex∣ample of all, will Pardon the Faults of the Composition for the Honesty of the Design; and forgive the presump∣tion of prefixing so Great a Name to so Small & Thing; when the only end of it, is to testify to the World, the Sense I have of those many personal Obligations, your Lordship has laid upon me which I never was, nor am ever like to be in a Capacity to deserve. And altho in pub∣lishing this Discourse, I have sufficiently published my own Weakness to a Critical and Censorious Age; yet, if by this means I can but publish at once my Gratitude to your Lordship for your Lordships Kindness to my Self, I am content to undergo the worst of Censures, that either Good or Bad Men can pass upon,
