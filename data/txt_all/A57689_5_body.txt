MY LORD,
WHen Your Honour shall consider the reason of this my bold Dedication, I know (were not Your Honour of a more Noble Spirit then to judge of things by the first sight or glimpse thereof) I should have little or no cause to hope of acceptance at Your Honours hands, but should rather justly be induced to expect (since it is my unhappiness to be a stranger to Your Honour) Your frown rather then favour, and reprehension for this my bold∣ness: But as it was nothing but really Your Honours Ver∣tues, (which (according to the Philosopher) are the onely Badges of Honour) and love to Learning that was the oc∣casion of this my transgression, I humbly presume (through them) my fault will be venial, since the blame is Your Ho∣nours
and that my self, and this my small Present shall finde access into Your Honours favour and Protection. The sub∣ject of this piece is that part of Astrology or NATURAL PHILO∣SOPHY which treateth of Elections, teaching by the powerful Influence of the Superior and Coelestial bodies, how to frame a fit and proper time for any manner of work belonging to the life of Man in a Natural way, there being (according to that most elegant expression of the chief of Philosophers, and sagest of Mortals SOLOMON, Eccles. 3.1.) A season for every thing, and a time for every purpose under the Sun. And truly it is a peice of that sublime Learning, that I fear it will pass the bounds of not only the common and ordinaryest, but the in∣different capacities of most men, and in some measure put even the most Judicious to seek, unless they are true sons [or Contemplators] of Nature, and its mysteries and secrets; this for the generality: Yet what conduceth to the administration of Physick and Phlebotomy (which according to Hippocrates and Galen (as I have sufficiently shewn in the 10 Chap. of the first Book of this Volume and the 1. Chapter of the 7. Sect. of this very third Treatise) can never be rightly administred without the help of this Art) is more easily to be comprehen∣ded, as also what tendeth to the use of Navigation and hus∣bandry. Wherefore since this my fabrick of THE RESTAU∣RATION OF ASTROLOGY or the true Natural Philosophy which is four square is finished now after my great pains and care, and brought to light, it imploreth Your Patronage, and espe∣cially this Corner, least the unworthyness of the Author may be a means of its fall to the ground without the least notice taken thereof, or hope of recovery, unless Your Honours No∣bility, Virtues and Learning be a gracious support thereunto, the which if Your Honour be Munificently pleased to grant, it will be a perpetual rock unto it, and an inexpressible fame unto him whose highth of ambition is to be
My LORD,
