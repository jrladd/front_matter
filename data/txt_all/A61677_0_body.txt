HOw well (dear Brother) art thou called Stone?
As sometimes Christ did Simon Cephas own.Ioh. 1. 42.
A Stone for solid firmness, fit to rear
A part in Ztons wall: and it upbear.
Like Stone of Bohan,Iosh. 15. 6. &. 18. 17. Bounds fit to describe,
'Twixt Church and Church, as that 'twixt Tribe and Tribe.
Like Samuel's Stone,1 Sam 7. 12. erst Eben-Ezer hight;
To tell the Lord hath helpt us with his might.
Like Stone in Davids sling,1 Sam. 17. 49â–ª 50. the head to wound
Of that huge Giant-Church, (so far renownd)
Hight at the Church-Catholike, Oecumenical,
Or at the lowest compass, National;
Yet Poteck, Visible, and of such a fashion,
As may or Rule a world or Rule a Nation.
Which though it be cry'd up unto the Skys,
By Philistms and Isralites likewise;
Yet seems to me to be too neer a kin
Unto the Kingdom of the Man of sin:
In frame, and state, and constitution,
Like to the first beast in the Revelation.Rev. 13.
Which was as large as Roman empire wide,
And Ruled Rome, and all the world beside.
Go on (good Brother) Gird thy Sword with might,
Fight the Lord's Battels, Plead his Churches Right.
To Brother Hooker, thou art next a kin,
By Office-Right thou must his pledge Redeem.
Take thou the double portion of his spirit,
Run on his Race, and then his Crown inherit.
Now is the time when Church is militant,
Time hast'neth fast when it shall be Tryumphant.
