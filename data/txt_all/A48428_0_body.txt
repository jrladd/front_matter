Renowned SIR,
MY chief aim in Publish∣ing this small Piece, is for the benefit of Sea∣men, who is known to be the chief Bulwark of our Kingdoms,
 and upon whose undaunted Cou∣rage, Resolution and Conduct, our Liberties and Properties wholly depend; who vindicate our Rights with the expence of their dearest Blood. The un∣deserved Disappointments they have received, unknown to your Honour, for some Years past; and the many Losses they have sustain'd for want of good Instructi∣ons, has induced me to the great∣est part of this work, which I hope will be of good use to them if duly applyed.
I don't mean there is any un∣just thing put upon them by their Superior Officers, who has a paternal care over them, but
 that they have not consulted a due Information for their own Interest.
This I can safely say, the in∣forming of Sea-men was my only aim in this small Piece, when I first set my Resolutions upon it; but having a Manuscript by me, writ by the famous Sir John Narbrough, I was advis'd by some Friends to put some material and useful things therein menti∣oned, in this, which I have done exactly from the Original.
When I resolved to make this Piece publick, the Epistle Dedi∣catory was mainly in the choice of a Patron, to testify my esteem of those extraordinary Qualifica∣tions
 in you, that have gained the Affections of even the best and worst of Sea-men, for whose sakes I have dedicated it to you, who sit at the Helm of their Government, to guide and direct them in their true Course, not doubting but you will accept of the weak Labours of
SIR,
