AS I live Gentlemen I am amaz'd how any piece could be made such minc'd-meat as this hah been by a twice-printed Copy, which I find flying a∣road to abuse the Author, who long since, traveling for compaenies-sake with a friend

into the Low. Countrys would needs for his own recreation write this Essay of them as He then found them: I am sure as far from ever think∣ing to have it publique, as he was from any private spleen to the Nation: or any person in it; for I have mo∣ved him often to print it, but could never get his consent, his modesty ever esteeming it among his puerilia, and (as he said) a piece too light for a prudentiall man to publish: the truth is, it was meerly oc∣casional in his youth, and the time so little, that he had for observation (his stay there not being above three weeks)

that it could not well be ex∣pected he should say more; and though the former part be jo∣culary and sportive, yet the seriousness of the latter part, renders the Character no way injurious to the people. And now finding some ruffled fea∣thers only presented for the whole bird, and having a perfect Copy by me, I have presumed to trespass so much upon the Author as to give it you (in vindication of him) so as I am confident it was dressed by his own Pen. And after I have begged his pardon for exposing it without his Warrant, I shall leave you to judge by

comparing this and the for∣mer Impressions, whether or no he hath not been abused sufficiently.
