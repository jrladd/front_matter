Worthy Sir,
THe first seeds of Spagyrical Phar∣macie, being sown by you into the field of my understanding, I do most humbly consecrate un∣to you (who have been pra∣ctising Chymistry these sixty years) these their first fruits (which are most justly yours) as a perpetual te∣stimony of my due gratitude and observance; de∣siring most earnestly, that you would cheerfully ac∣cept this little offering, and permit your reverend Name to be thus inserted at it's beginning; that, as an Amulet, it may banish envy, and aprase malice. In the mean time, I shall pray, that the Almighty would be pleased to prolong your life for the good of your Relations, and of His own people; and that at length, when you shall be full of dayes, He would crown you with glory and immortality. Fare-well.
 Edinburgh,
Feb. 4. 1659.
