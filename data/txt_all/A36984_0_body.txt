Most Honour'd,
THis New Comedy which I beg leave to Dedicate to ye, when it was first shewn to some Persons of Principal Quality and Judgment, and afterwards Read to Mr. Congreve and Mr. Betterton, had, from all, the good Fortune, to be esteem'd as one of the Best I have Written: And 'tis from this undisputed Authority that I hope it will, in the Perusal, have the same Value from you; and appear worthy the Honour of your Patronage.
As the World is full of Various Humours, so the Diversions that Poets are oblig'd to Invent to satisfy 'em, must be also as various. And tho' 'tis one of the hardest things in the World to do—yet is the failure— (for that time especially) the Intire Loss of an Au∣thor's Credit as well as Profit; for an Audience of this Age is destin'd to use neither Medium, Consideration nor Modesty; wholly resolv'd to like what Indulges the Present Humour, tho' Reason, if they thought it worth looking after, would always Inform 'em, that there is often as much Art, Labour and Wit us'd, in what through the Vitiation of the Pallate they have no Rellish for— As what they willingly swallow with a Voracious Gusto.
It has been my Fortune, through the short Course of my Poetry, to run o'er the Rugged Ways of Publick Censure, with as much In∣difference as any one; and as I have alwayes Studied Variety to procure Diversion, so have I met with as Various Success— yet have been easy by Teaching my Self the Philosophy of Patience, and the Use of that Common Saying, Many Men have many Minds, and those Many Minds possess'd with more Difficult Expectations then gen¦ral

the best Vndertaker could satisfy. But to give Instance, that my Industrious Paines have not been wanting to please the Town, if they look into my former Peices, they may find, without much trou∣ble, a Variety, which has not been every Bodies Tallent; they may find, in the Fond Husband, Regular Comedy with a Good Plot; in the oarding-School, Satyrical Humour and Charcters with another; in the Mrriage Hater, A Mixture of all digested with Comical Turnes to the last Scene; Also in the Don Quirro's arsical Scenes of Mirth, mixt with Variety of Divertive Vocal Mu∣sick and Dancing, with many others, some from Stories, but most wholly my own Inventions, and all of Different Kinds, which have had their several Lots; some have pleased more, some less, according as the Town Humour eb'd and flow'd; but gene∣rally as 'tis the Fate of things of this kind, have met with Mistaken Judgment; the Meritorious having Indifferent Applause, the Indif∣ferent Extraordinary.
And 'tis in this manner that this last, the Intrigues at Veailles, has been usd by the Criticks; Many less Labour'd, and Worthy, have had more Applause; the Model of it being Courtly, and want∣ing the Farsical Scenes, with which the Inconsiderate part of the Au∣dience were formerly Entertain'd — and also the Turns requiring observation, and the Whole Contriv'd Machine exacting more thought—then i Natural for heads that are Buzzing with other matters in the layhouse, and sit on their Shoulders uneasy in a hot Summer season.
'Tis therefore from the Considerate and Cooler part of the Com∣pany from whom I did, in the Acting, and shall in the Reading, expect Justice; Amongst whom I beg leave to Name you Sir, to whom this Piece is First Address'd— as Principle— Nothing can Judge of Wit so well as Wit; And it has many years been my Ad∣vantage, as well as other oets, to be Influenc'd by your Genius, and Instructed by your Admirable Writings and Improving Conversa∣tion, I heard the Fame of Sir Charles Sedley, as soon as I was capable of hearing, or (I'm sure) understanding such a thing as Fame it self. And your being Bred in your youth, and receiv'd all along in a Community and Friendship with Persons of the most Exalted Spi∣rits, and Uncommon Understandings adorning the then Flourishing Nation, viz. The never-enough admir'd Soul, and Genius of Wit and oetry the Present Earl of Dorset, the late Earl of Rochester, and others of their Refin'd Rank, sufficiently gives the World know∣ledge

of your equal Merit, and spares me the share of Writing fur∣ther on your Praise, which has so often (much better then I am able to do) been done already.
However, Sir, I must beg ye to give me leave to make use of the oets common gratitude—Thankes, which I think my self never enough Capacitated to pay, when I reflect on your Generous com∣mendation and approvement of my Lyrical quality, and writings of that kind, not only to your friends abroad, but even before the Right Honourable the Earl of Leicester, the greatest Incourager and Patron of all the Muses, and their forlorn and desolate Sons, to whom I wish all the happiness that Heaven and Earth can give, and that 'twere possible his Life could last like his Fame—This, Sir, from you has given me a Credit which I esteem as a Fortune, and which is not in the power of Malice to destroy.
That word Malice has given me a little occasion for Digression, only to tell you that there is in this Comedy amongst the Characters— One of an old Beau, under the Name of the Count Brissac—which I hear by some offended, has been perticularly piqu'd at, I could not recommend its defence, Sir, to a person who can better Judge its Innocent nature then your self, having very lately been diverted by a very good Coppy of Verses which I am told are yours, and which I beg leave to insert,





SCrape, scrape no more your Bearded Chins,
Old Beau's in hopes to please
You should Repent your former Sins,
Not study their Increase.
Young Fops do daily shock our Sight,
But Old ffend both day and Night.



In vain the Coachman turns about,
And Whips the Dapple Grayes,
When the Old Oagler looks out,
We Turn away the Face.
Youth and Gay-Love will ever Charme,
But both affected cannot warm.



The Summer Fruits we highly prize,
They kindly cool the Blood;
But Winter Berrys we despise,
And leave 'em in the Wood;
On the Bush they may look well,
But Gather'd, fail in Taste and Smll.




Which Verses are really of so Instructive a Nature, that I could wish my Critick could digest 'em, as he ought, with all my heart.
And now, Sir, to you, the happy Son of the Author of these and other highly Valu'd things of this kind; I humbly desire a Minutes Address, and that you will be pleas'd to divide with your Father this Poetical Offering: Your Judgment I can never doubt, tho' you think it not fit to Write; for, being so nearly related to him in Blood, you must naturally have more than a small Portion of his Genius; you shew all the taking Qualifications for which his Bloom of Youth was Admir'd and Lov'd, except his oer which 'tis rea∣son to believe you negligently desert, onely because you observe how barren the returns of Acknowledgment and Praise are in an Age, where Mens Minds are either harrass'd with War, or Numb'd with Ignorance, to a Muse even of his Excellence, which Theame, if ever you do take Pen in hand, I am almost assur'd will be the first— there being more between you than the ordinary Duty and Love Incumbent between Father and Son, an entire, free, and easie Friend∣ship — Submission with Satisfaction on your side — and Content∣ment with Pleasure on his, which I have observ'd in the few hours of my Conversation with you, by your frequent Expression of your uncommon Felicity in so good a Father's Indulgence. And, that this happiness between you may last to the utmost Extent of Time and Humane Nature—is the Real Wish
