ALthough it is a dutie incumbent to all Men, as Men; and to all Pro∣fessors, as Christians, to love Mankinde, as Christ loved us; and to imitate the God of the spirits of all flesh, who causeth his Sun to shine upon the good and the bad; and although there is a spe∣cial delight, to do that which is good and commendable, onely for the love of Goodness it self, and the commenda∣bleness of Virtue; Yet, when wee meet with special and powerful encouragements to set us on, and provo∣cations to draw forth our affections to laudable endea∣vors, wee must needs add som more effectual zeal to the performance of these duties. For mine own part I

may say it without vanitie, that the first of these mo∣tives, the delight to do good, in love to the Publick, hath supported mee hitherto, notwithstanding manifold destructions in the waie wherein I have walked. And as it hath been one of my Aims, to have the honor (if possibly I could attain unto it) of serving the Publick. gratìs, and at mine own cost, in the best things: So I have made it a part of my Agencie, to provoke others to do the like, by offering unto everie one, the things which might bee most advantagious unto themselvs, by doing service unto others. And how far my affections have carried mee beyond my abilities in this cours, I need not to mention: this hath onely been my comfort, that having served my Generation generously and freely, I never had caus to repent of what I had don, whether it were resented by others, or not. But now of late, see∣ing it hath pleased God, not onely by the settlement of this State in the waie of a Common-wealth, to give to all men a more open door then ever heretofore, to enter upon a concurrence to serv the Publick, that thereby they might both preserv and encreas their own welfare; but that I have found unexspectedly from your Honors som peculiar expression of favor towards my self, upon the account of my publick-heartedness; I must confess, that I am thereby not so much refresh∣ed

by reason of that which befalleth to my self, as delighted in the hopeful apprehension of that which befalleth to the Publick, whiles in this particular I am able to perceiv, that the good hand of God hath put the management of his Caus and Work in the hands of Men, whom hee hath endued with a publick spirit, which is a clear testimonie to mee, that hee will build thereon a superstructure, which by his grace upon your waies will redound to his glorie and evince unto the world, that it is not anie private Interest, but his Glorie and the Publick Happiness, which hath acted and doth act, both the Parliament and your selvs in all your undertakings. And verily the consideration of this ve∣rie thing, that God hath set in publick places Men that minde the Publick for it self, and seek out those that are so-inclined, although they make no special application unto them (which hitherto I have not don) is more worth to mee then the private advantage, which your Honors favor can bring unto mee. For although the straits, wherewith the times, and my own forwardness to serv others have cast mee, might induce mee to rejoice at the fruit of your Honors bountie towards my self; Yet that is no waies comparable to the sens of joie, which I have at the clear Character, which this hath given mee of the spirit by which you are led; for herein I

perceiv that henceforth the labors of impartial love to∣wards the Publick, are not like to bee in vain, as for the most part they have been heretofore, and that there will bee som real encouragement for the making of ra∣tional overtures, tending to resolv that grand question, which is proposed by the Psalmist in the name of all men, who, with one and the same accent, say; Psal. 4.6. Who will shew us anie good? Therefore since the Wis∣dom of the Parlament hath enacted a waie to answer the Quere, as to the Trade of this Nation (which is a manifest demonstration of their eminent care for the Publick) it hath raised with joie both mine own, and the thoughts of som others to a forwardness of contribu∣ting, that which might bee subservient and useful to that design; that as Bees belonging to t'e same hive, wee should bring our honie together, to bee preserved and encreased in one stock for the good of all. In order to this resolution, and as a testimonie of gratitude, I thought it might bee seasonable to offr to your Honors, and under your name to the Publick, this following Epistolarie Discours, which relate's unto the advance∣ment of Agriculture, beeing one of the Noblest and most necessarie parts of Industrie belong∣ing to a Common-wealth, the first ground of mutual trading amongst men, and the well-spring

of wealth in all well ordered Societies. And if concerning this subject (as beeing a main Inte∣rest of State) som cours in due time were thought upon to set forward the Judicial, and regulate the Practical waie of Husbandrie, such overtures could bee made in that kinde, as would sensibly (even to the meanest capa∣citie) demonstrate a very Cornu-Copia and fulness to bee atteined of the choisest temporal blessings to supplie all men's wants. And although I cannot say much of mine own experience in this matter, yet Pro∣vidence having directed mee by the improvement of se∣veral relations unto the Experiences and Observa∣tions of others, I finde my self obliged to becom a con∣duit-pipe thereof towards the Publick, chiefly now, where there is so favorable an aspect of Patronage from those that are in eminent places towards those that minde publick advantages. Prov. 11.25. It is said in the Proverbs, that hee who doth withhold Corn the people shall curs him; but a blessing shall bee upon the head of him that selleth it. If not to impart the means of livelihood to those that stand in▪ need thereof, when it is in our power to supplie them therewith, bee to withhold the same; and this deserves a curs: then no man can blame mee for the largeness of this communication, from which all

that shall reap anie benefit, are thereby to bee indebted unto your Publick affections, and bless them as the caus, whose influence hath given it this production; for it is included onelie as a pledg of further endevors in the same and other kindes, for which the State in due time will bee beholden to your care and vigilance, when the tenders thereof shall finde that acceptance, and the furtherance thereof, that encouragement which your wisdom and love to the Publick shall finde expedient to bestow thereon. May the God of all grace and good∣ness so bless your Consultations for the good of this State, that they may end in the settlement of a firm and lasting Peace, where not onely outward Plentie and Prospe∣ritie, but the treasures of a better life in the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, may bee enjoied to the prais of God the Father. These are, and shall bee the dailie prairs of
