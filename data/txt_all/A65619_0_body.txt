Dear and Honoured Sir,
I Send You this to express my
hearty Wishes, That You may
enjoy a Happy Christmass and
New-Year. And also to let You
know, That the kind Letter You
writ me long since (wherein You
desire me to consider the Descrip∣tion
of the Church of Tyre, of
the Holy Sepulchre, and of the
Apostles at Constantinople, men∣tioned
and described by Eusebius,
in his Ecclesiastical History, &c.)
came again lately to my Hands,
with some imperfect Essays of

Schemes, that I then drew of
those Noble Structures. These I
have now again review'd and fi∣nished,
and have added a short
Discourse to them, containing some
general Considerations on the An∣cient
Churches, or Publick places
of God's Worship; as an Intro∣duction
to my Observations on
these Magnificent Structures.
For the more clear Illustration
of all which, I have added a
Plane of the Ancient Greek
Church; according to my own
Observations of Several very An∣cient
Structures, with an Explica∣tion
of the use of Each part: And
then I may Conclude with an
Application, relating to our Own
Religious Assemblies; which may
be useful to those who shall come
to Consider of proper Mediums,
to Reconcile the Small Differences
that are between the Dissenters
and Ʋs, concerning these Matters.
For by these things, it is most
manifest; That the Primitive

Christians did endeavour to per∣form
the Publick Worship of GOD,
with as great External Reverence
and Magnificence, as possible; joyned
to the Internal Truth, Fervency
of Spirit and Mind.
I wish You could have seen these
Papers before I Publisht them;
either to Alter, Correct, or Amend
what You may find Amiss, or less
to the Purpose. For You are a
Person upon whose Judgment, I
shall ever Entirely Rely; knowing
the Great Candour, Perspicuity,
Learning and Faithfulness of it.
But since I cannot easily have that
Satisfaction, I shall present You
with them as I may; as a Token
of the Great Respect and Value
I have for You, upon many Ac∣counts;
Especially the Education
I had under You, and the Friend∣ship
You have ever Expressed
towards me.
If it be a Thing that may prove
Acceptable to You, and useful to
the Publick, as You intimate; I

shall be highly pleased with the
Ʋndertaking; as I shall be always
to shew the Value I have for You,
in any thing You Recommend to my
Studies within the Capacity of
