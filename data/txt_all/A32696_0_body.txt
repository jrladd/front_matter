My most Honour'd Lord,
AS in the Firmament, or Ae∣thereal region of the Great World, the Creator hath placed two great Lights, the one to rule the Day, the other to rule the Night: So, (to con∣stitute

a perfect Analogy or correspon∣dence) in the Firmament or Celestial part of the Lesser World, Man, hath He placed two great Truths (the proper Lights of the Soul) the one to rule the Day, or Life of Man; the other to dispel the horrid dark∣nes of his Night, Death. And these are those twin-like proleptical Notions of the Being of the Deity, and of the Immortality of the Human Soul. I call them Twin-like Proleptical Notions, because, as the Sun and Moon were made together, so were these implanted at once in the Mind of the First Man, and have as constantly shined in the region of every mans Soul since, as those have done in the Heavens, however the o∣pacity of terrene Objects and Corporeal Af∣fections may seem somtimes to eclipse them: and because, as the Sun doth commu∣nicate its light to the Moon, so doth the For∣mer of these super-excellent Notions, illumi∣nate the Latter; the knowledg of the Im∣mortality of the Soul, receiving illustration, if not absolute dependence, from the know∣ledge of the Existence of God.
The Consideration hereof (may it please your Lordship) as it engaged me, some years since, to endeavour the Demonstra∣tion of the Existence of God; so hath it now of late importuned and prevailed up∣on me, to attempt the Demonstration of the Immortality of Mens Souls, by pure and sincere Reason: To the end, that such as doubt of either, may be convinced of the extream folly and absurdity of their unbe∣lief; and such as firmly believe both, may be corroborated in their true perswasions, observing the Testimony of the Light of Nature to make a perfect Symphonie and concordance with thatof Authority Divine. A Design, certainly, neither inconsistent with the genuine zeal of a Christian, nor unwor∣thy the most serious speculation of a Phi∣losopher: And were I as well assured, that I have not fallen much short of what might be expected from me, in the capacity of the Latter, as I am, that I have not in the least transgressed the sacred bounds of the Former; I should with more reason hope your Lordships Approbation of my perfor∣mance

therein, than the sense of my own in∣sufficiency will permit me now to entertain. And, therefore, though perhaps my Reason∣ings have not attained to that perfection and exquisite Rigour, as to satisfie those immo∣derately Curious Wits of our Age, who think it much beneath them, to acquiesce in any other Evidence but that of Demon∣strations Geometrical (of which notwith∣standing, the Argument of these my Dis∣courses is absolutely uncapable; as I have therein manifested, by clear and undeniable reason); Yet I may comfort my self with this, that my present Undertaking will be Acceptable to as many, as reflect upon the Piety and Good Intention of it; and my Proofs sufficiently Perswasive for all such, who come not to examine the force of them with invincible Prejudice, and reso∣lution not to be convinced.
But, lest I should seem to anticipate your Lordships Iudgement, which being most profound, cannot but be also most E∣quitable; it becometh me rather to excuse this my exceeding Presumption, in daring

to invoke the Patronage of so Illustrious a Person as your Lordship, to so ill-composed a work▪ as this is; which (with all conceivable Humility and Devotion of Spirit) I here lay at your feet. Truly, My Lord, I have so many Reasons to alleage, in defence of this my Ambition, that, should I insist upon but the one half of them, this sheet would swell into a Volume greater than the Book it self, which it now ushers to your View. Let it suffice, therefore, I most humbly beseech you, that, had I had no inclinations in my self to this way of testifying my Reve∣rence and Admiration of your Lordships E∣minency, both in the Quality of your Per∣son, and Perfections of your Mind; yet the very rules of common Prudence, and Law of Decency would not have permitted me to make this Addresse to any other, but your self▪ For,
When I reflect upon Greatnesse of Con∣dition; instantly my thoughts fix upon your Lordship as one, whom your high Birth, and higher Merits (assisted by the favour of Heaven) have elevated to a sublime sphear

of Honour, wherein, among the Nobility of the First Magnitude, you shine with dazling lustre, such as strikes the eyes of all below with solemn Veneration, and excites a noble Emulation in those Few that move in the same orb of Dignity with you.
If I consider greatnesse of Virtue; I need look no further then upon your Lordship, in whom all Heroical Virtues are so tran∣scendently conspicuous, that they seem to be Essentially concentred in your very Nature, and as if they were therein met together, on purpose to shew the world, How glorious a thing may result from such a Conflux of Great and Good.
If I respect Greatness of Judgment; whi∣ther, even in this Age of Light, should I go but to your Lordship? Who, having with con∣tinued industry cultivated that fertil and ca∣pacious field of your Mind, and planted it with all the most usefull Notions in Theolo∣gy, Metaphysicks, Physicks, Medicine, Law Civil and Common, the Mathematicks, and other Arts and Sciences; have at length reap∣ed so rich a Harvest of General Knowledge,

as might alone plentifully maintain the whole Commonwealth of Letters. Insomuch as all men are ready to confess, that if there be an Universal Oracle in the World, for the sol∣ving all Difficulties in Learning, You are it: Nor doth any thing restrain them from ac∣cusing you of Engrossing all Science to your self, but your rare Affability, and prompt∣ness to impart it to others.
Should I look forth for the Chiefest Pa∣tron of Learned Men; the Common People themselves, daily observing so great a Con∣fluence of men of the Long Roab, to the place of your residence, and those too the most emi∣nent in their several Faculties, would soon direct me to your Lordship: And your Fa∣vour of Schollars is become so notorious, that I have heard it urged as a chief Cause, why Learning hath of late found such admi∣rable Advancement in our Nation, notwith∣standing the check of our unhappy Civill Warres.
In fine, should I consult my own parti∣cular Obligations; Gratitude it self would rise up and injoyn me to make this Oblation

only to your Lordship; since from you alone I have received more both of Encourage∣ment and Assistance in my studies, than from the whole World beside; so that, indeed, your Right to this Homage I now make to your Lordship, doth wholly take away the Free∣dom of it.
What I have said, My Lord, though (I fear me) scarce agreeable to your severe Modesty; is yet fully agreeable with Truth, and as wel known as your Name; and therefore, without offending the Law of Decency (as I said a∣fore) I ought not to have permitted this Trea∣tise to venture abroad into the common Aer, without that Advantage and Protection, which your, and only your Patronage can give it▪ Nor would Policie have advised me otherwise: for, albeit among my Readers, ma∣ny may chance to dislike the Book it self; yet, sure I am, most will like it much the bet∣ter, for carrying so illustrious a Name in the Epistle; and the severest Criticks can∣not but commend my judgement in the Dedi∣cation.
Notwithstanding all these Inducements

alleageable in favour of my Boldness, I think it safer to cast my self intirely upon your Lordships Charity, for a Forgiveness of it, than to trust in their importance, how grea soever it may seem. And therefore, without being further rude, in disturbing your thoughts from things of more weight and concernment; I most humbly beg your Lordships gracious Acceptance of this publick acknowledgment, I here make, of that infinite Observance and Thankfulness, which is due to you from,
My most Honourd LORD
