I Do not plant thy great respected name
Here in this front, to th' end thou shouldst protect
These my endeuors from contempt or blame,
Which none but their own forces must effect:
Nor do I seeke to win thy more respect,
Most learned Lord, by these Essaies of mine,
Since that cleere iudgement that did first elect
To fauor me, will alwaies keepe me thine:
Nor do I this more honor to assigne.
Vnto thy worth that is not more hereby,
Since th' offrings made vnto the powers deuine,
Enrich not them but shew mens pietie:
But this I do to th'end if destinie
Shall any monument reserue of me,
Those times should see my loue, how willing I
That liu'd by thee, would haue thee lius with me.
