SEEING it hath plea∣sed the Lord, of his great mercie, and goodnes, to vouchsafe vnto vs that inestimable treasure of his holy word: the preciousnes where∣of,



surmounteth all things vnder the sunne: wherein he doth offer, euen his owne selfe vnto vs, and teacheth vs the way whereby we may come vnto him: it behoueth vs with all reuerence, and feare, to imbrace the same, preferring it before any thing that we can desire vp∣on the earth. And forasmuch as it hath pleased him, to put that precious trea∣sure in these earthly vessells, subiect vn∣to corruption, and mortality: which by the natural disposition that they are of, will striue to infect all the fruite of that precious treasure, with the stenche of sinnefull and vngodly desires: we are diligently to watch, and contend, that we see, that these fleshly and inordinate motions (that seeke so greatly to extin∣guish euery good thing) may be dayly more and more kept vnder: that the word of God may (by the working of his holy spirit) get the victorie in our harts, and sit there as a Prince, to rule the cogitations therof, captiuing them daily vnto the kingdom of Iesus Christ, thorough obedience to his most bles∣sed



will. The which, forsomuch as it is done, especially, by the ministery of the word, wherein the Lord hath printed such force, that it throweth downe all munitions reared against it: and vnto the worke of the same, hath appointed me among you (of many other most vnable) to do that, which he commaun∣deth, and my duety requireth at my hands: it standeth both me, and you, in hand, to be most heedefull, that we be not carelesse in these great and weighty matters, which doe concerne the glory of Almightie God, and the eternall sal∣uation, both of our soules and bodies: and so much the rather, because Satan fearing the continuance of the world to be short: and therefore, that which he doeth for the aduancement of his owne kingdome, he must doe it quick∣ly: laboureth by his instruments, with tooth and naile, to extinguish the light of the glorious Gospell, that it should not shine with open face, vnto Gods people: for we see daily, what mischie∣uous practises he broacheth, what er∣rors



he spreadeth, what slaunders he in∣uenteth, what lyes he disperseth, and all to discredite the course of religion: the truth whereof we doe feele, and see in our owne experience: for you knowe, what enimitie the establishment of the Gospell amongst you had, by your en∣uious foes, that would haue kept you still in palpable ignorance, with them∣selues: howe many pullbacks and hin∣derances were deuised, and be daily in∣uented, to stay the course thereof, all which, for so much, as (thorough the mercie of God, to vs-ward) they haue not had that successe, which the au∣thors hoped for: they labour now, and haue done continually, to imagine slaū∣derous lyes, and most wicked forgeries, which they doe daily spread abroad, to the ende, to defame the religion, which we professe: so that there is not (al∣most) any sinne, that can be commit∣ted, but it is fathered vpon some of vs: which deuillish dealing, albeit we know that it shall turne to their eternall de∣struction, vnlesse the Lorde in mercie,



giue them grace to repent: yet not∣withstāding we may learne a very good lesson out of the same, and make a pro∣fitable vse of it vnto our selues: let me therefore intreate you, to marke with diligence this which I shall write vnto you, as you are wont to doe, when I doe speake. The greatest accusation (you knowe) in generall, that your foes, the aduersaries of the Gospell, doe charge you with, is, that you professe one thing, and practise another: that you say well, and doe naughtily: that you reprehēd others, you your selues being worse: which (in deede) is a most hei∣nous accusation, and such a thing, as, your owne selues can witnesse, I neuer haue winked at, but most carefully re∣proued, and such a thing as our religi∣on neither teacheth, nor permitteth▪ for it is of that force, where it entreth▪ that it will reforme all these things (in measure) in those that haue it within them. This slaunder goeth yet further: for our profession is accused, to be se∣ditious, contentious, and troublesome



vnto the state, and enemie to good or∣der, and gouernment: & we our selues accounted malicious, proude, finding rather fault with others, than amen∣ding our selues, seeking rather for sin∣gularitie, than loue and charitie. You are not ignorant of the sleights of Sa∣tan: and therfore knowing, that he was from the beginning, an accuser, and ly∣ar, may the better, by the mercie of God, haue vse of your knowledge, to comfort you in these temptations. But marke, how the Lord maketh Satan, & his imps, to be as spurs and pricks, to driue the godly forward, though they be very grosse, and dull in the behol∣ding of their owne faults: (for Satan casteth a myste ouer their eyes, when they should see them) yet they be very quicke eyed, to prye into the doings of others, especially, the godly, and are able, if our foote doe but slip, to find it out, and haue it as a reason to discredit our profession, which aboue all things, we labour to keepe vnspotted. There∣fore it behooueth you, to looke dili∣gently



vnto your selues, to watch your owne soules, to attend and looke vnto euery worde that you speake, euery thought that you thinke, and euery a∣ction that you commit: to examine it diligently, by the line of Gods word, which is the touchstone, that wil either approue it, or disproue it: and if you find, by the vndoubted warrant there∣of, that it is lawfull, and that you ought to doe it, then let neither slaunder, speach of people, deuill, nor hell, staye you from the practise thereof: but if, (thorough the remnants of old Adam) you be at any time allured to doe, or speake any thing, that either is forbid∣den, or hath no warrant from the word of God, then reason thus with your selues: this is not agreeable to my pro∣fession: this is contrary to that I haue learned: this will procure the name of God to be dishonoured, my religion to be defamed, and my selfe to be discre∣dited: therefore, though it might be gainefull, delightfull, or any other way pleasure me, I may not doe it: this you



had neede to marke very well: for (I tell you) you haue many lookers on, that would laugh to see your fall: you dwell in a country, where the Gospell is very litle preached: insomuch, that your ignorant neighbours make them selues sport, to mocke at you, that will be so foolish, as to suffer your selues to be seduced by the Scriptures: you haue godlesse and profane men, that doe de∣ride you: Libertines, and freewill men, that doe despise you: worldlings and bellygods, that doe carpe at you: inso∣much, that you haue very great neede to walke warily: that it standeth you vpon, to behaue your selues circum∣spectly: therefore doe thus: be dili∣gent in publike hearing, and, (as it may stand with your calling) priuate rea∣ding of the worde of God, (for that is the onely schoolemaister, to teach you all truth) vsing daily and hartie prayer vnto God, for the presence of his holy spirite, to teach you the true meaning thereof: looke what you finde therein required of euery Christian, be carefull



to doe it: in your dealing with others, deale faithfully, without facing out of ill matters: without swearing, or lying: reproue others with the spirite of mild∣nes, that doe amisse, in your presence: shewe your selues obedient vnto all au∣thoritie, that is appointed of God: and that for conscience sake. Bring vp your children, and seruants, in the feare of God, instructing them in the principles of religion: detract no man secretly, but tell them plainely of their faults: to conclude, shewe your selues approued vnto the Lord, in the testimonie of a good conscience, being alwaies carefull to seeke the glorie of God, and benefit of your brethren: be alwaies in worde and deede, that, which (according to the Scriptures) ye professe: and then, let Satan broach his lyes: let the wicked carry them abroad: let godlesse per∣sons hate you, as long as they may, it shall turne to their shame at the length, as (to our great comfort) we see it doth daily, and (being a triall of your pati∣ence) to your greater glorie in the king∣dome



of heauen: and let not the glory of this world bewitch you, for ye are not of this world: let not the successe of godlesse persons dismay you, for the world loueth his owne, and is liberall vnto them: let not the slaunders of the wicked discourage you: for because you runne not on into the same excesse of riot with them, therefore they speake euill of you: let not the multitude of your aduersaries feare you, for God is strōger then all men: let not the threat∣nings of great ones daunt you, for their heartes are in the handes of the Lord, to be guided at his pleasure: let not the pronenesse of your owne na∣ture seduce you, for he that liueth af∣ter the flesh, shall die: let not the crosses that accompanye the Gospell wearie you, for they bring the ioyfull fruite of righteousnesse, to all that are exercised thereby: so shall the name of God be glorified by you: so shall your foes be put to flight, & your profession known to be the truth of the eternall God, that liueth for euer. Now, to come to speake



of these present sermons, which I haue dedicated chiefly vnto you: partly for that, by that calling which the Lorde hath layd vpon me, I am at this instant, bound, by all lawfull meanes, to doe you good: partly, because it is the ear∣nest sute of some of you, to haue them penned: & partly, for that they contain in them sundrye pointes of religion, which you doe professe, and for which, you are of the world condemned: that euery man may see thereby, the impu∣dencie of Satan, that dare note Gods owne word with the marke of infamie: onely let me craue this at your hands, as a recompence for my trauaile, that you woulde expresse the doctrine in your liues, that I haue expressed, (though simply, yet truly) therein: that I may once see in you all that zeale, which the example of these sheepe∣herds may teach you: then shal I thinke my labour well bestowed, when the beames of righteousnesse doe breake forth, as the sun at noone day: which, the Lord, for his mercie, graunt, in his



Sonne, our Sauiour Iesus Christ: to whome with the father, and the holy ghost, be all honor and glorie, both now, and for euer.
Amen.
