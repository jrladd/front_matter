Madam,
BEing much importun'd by some
Friends that were present at the
Preaching of this Sermon, to
make it publick, I have at last, not with∣out
a great deal of reluctancy, yielded to
it. I confess, the Arguments they us'd were
not inconsiderable, (viz.) that, 'twas fit
the memory of so excellent a Person should
be transmitted to Posterity, and that I
ought to contribute what I could to the
reformation of this loose and vitious Age,
by setting before them so rare an Exam∣ple
of Vertue and Goodness; But being
conscious of my own inability so lively to
draw his Picture, as to make it fully to
represent him, or in any tollerable degree

be useful to others, I had withstood their
Arguments as well as their Request, but
that I was inform'd the thing would be
acceptable to you also, to whom I must
acknowledge my Obligations to be so great,
that I am put beyond the possibility of de∣clining
any thing that may be grateful to
you; such therefore as it is I present it to
you; I know the hearty love you bear to
the Subject will be inducement enough to
you to excuse the meaness of the Dress
it comes in, and if it proves of any ad∣vantage,
to the Interest of Religion, to
promote Truth and Righteousness amongst
men, I shall not repent the Publication of
it. I am ever,
Madam,
