My Lord,
THis Work does every way belong to your Lordship; for besides the many Obligations your Honour has been pleas'd to lay upon me, and to advise me to the composing of it, I know not a Person more universally Learned, and more capable of Judging all sorts of Learned Writings. I doubt not, My Lord, but your wonted Goodness and Affability will vouchsafe me a favourable Acceptance of this Present: Though I must acknowledge 'tis with some Reluctancy that I make it. There is so much difficulty in making Abstracts, and one finds so rarely wherewith at the same time to Please and Instruct, that I can hardly hope I have done any thing worthy to be Presented
to so delicate a Judgment as your Lordship's. I have been unfortunate in that I write not in my own Lanâˆ£guage; by which Means some Improprieties may escape, of which I am ignorant, and which I hope your Lordship will pardon.
I presume to offer this Essay to your Lordship, partly because I have the Honour to be known to your Lordship by other Works; and that I hope, under your Lordships Patronage, to be assisted for the Future, from Men of Parts and Learning, with something more considerable, and more deserving your Lordships perusal. I am, with all Duty and Respect,
My LORD,
