THE History of Life and Death, being the last of sixe Monethly designations, seemed worthy to bee preferred to bee the se∣cond in Publication, because the least losse of time, in a matter of so

great utility, should bee, pretious, for wee hope, and desire that it may redound to the good of many; and that noble Physitians raising their minds, may not be whol∣ly imployd in uncleane cures, nor honoured only for necessity, but become also the Stewards of Di∣vine Omnipotency and Clemency, in prolonging and renewing the life of

Man, especially since it may be done by safe, con∣venient, civill, but un∣tryed new waies and meanes: For while  Christians aspire and labour to come to the Land of Promise; it will be a signe of Divine fa∣vour, if our shoos and the garments of our frail bo∣dies, be here little worne in our iourney in the worlds wildernesse.
