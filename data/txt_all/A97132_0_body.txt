Madam,
HAving de∣signed this Treatise for the Instruction of a Minde yet in∣communicable; least Errour or Malice should under such la∣titude
of Time intercept the in∣tention; I have presumed to Im∣plore hereto the Influence of your Graces; That the Dig∣nity of your Il∣lustrious Attri∣butes might warrant it a se∣cure tutelage to
Posterity. The Nature of the Subject will, I hope, successe∣fully intercede for your Rece∣ption; since it is the perfect Character of your own pra∣cticall Piety: and the fairest Pledge to your
celestiall Inhe∣rency. (Nor can the Ascer∣tion passe for ci∣vill Ceremony) the living Te∣stimonies of your Glory are as fre∣quent and uni∣versall as hu∣mane Infirmi∣ties: and the Consequence as
effectuall as a continuall Sa∣crifice, regemi∣nated by the nu∣merous Afflu∣ence of gratefull Votaries. Ma∣dam, both Civill and Intellectuall Endowments, have in your fruition thereof, attained the
highest Perfe∣ction, fully meet∣ing the due In∣tention of their Enlargement, their uninteres∣sed distribution. All Arts and Sciences what∣soever have faln from their pri∣mitive Honour, Credit, and pos¦sibly
their ef∣ficacy, since be∣come Objects of Commerce and Prostitutes to abject Lucre. The splendor of their glory sur∣vives yet onely in your Dispen∣sation of their Virtues. The Influence of
whose ministry therein, extend∣ing beyond the pretence of any Relation or Re∣ference whate∣ver. It being to any an irresist∣ible Plea to a, Right in your succour, to af∣firm that they want it. To a∣void
an impro∣priety in which position I must not so far tres∣pass against the Dignity of so communicable a Bounty, as indi∣strust thereof to thrust these ad∣dresses into a sin∣gular exception. Nor will the
rules of Civility admit thereto so confident an In∣troduction, as to precede the ac∣cess of an agree∣ing Election: I will therefore humbly waite your pleasure to distinguish un∣der what degree of Inherency you
shall vouchsafe to shelter this a∣bandoned Pro∣duction, tendered by,
Madam,
