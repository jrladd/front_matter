SIR,
I Hope the world will not blame
me, for increasing the crowd of
Englishwriters, with which, it is
so much troubled: nor censure me
of folly for thrusting this little
Booke into the throng, where it
is like to be smoothered, if I may
be admitted to put in this plea. To the first, that

as a dutifull sonne, in honour of my deare fathers
Name and memory, I strive for some place for this
Monument, which may be some meanes to perpetu∣ate
the same in Gods Church: as a faithfull Exe∣cutor,
I am carefull to discharge this part of his
(though but nuncupative) will, to endeavour the
publishing of this, and some other of his Workes,
which himselfe intended and had prepared for the
presse▪ To the latter, I plead, that though it be
in it selfe but small, yet will it finde in the throng, a
booke to which it is neerely allyed, a childe of the
same Authors braine and heart (the Lectures on
Saint Iohn 4.) which having found free and speedy
passage, will make way for this, and easily procure
it welcome and entertainment, where it selfe hath
found the like; and I presume elsewhere also: for
somuch as the company of this may be procured at
a farre easier charge then the former, and as it
hath one already to lead the way, so (God willing)
ere long (I hope) it shall be seconded by another of
later bth, but greater growth. It no way becometh
me to commend this, or any other worke of his (let
me rather strive to imitate him my selfe, then to
commend him, or any thing of his to others) his ve∣ry
name will commend them. And least under that
name, the reader should suspect he may bee abused:

I heere solemnly promise, that what is or shall be▪ by
me published under his name, shall not be loose notes
(that have beene taken by some ignorant Scribe)
nor shall it be made up with additions, and alterati∣ons
of my owne▪ bu the Copies under his owne hand
carefully transcribed.
And as for publishing these Sermons, I have
good reason, so for dedicating them, to your selfe.
The occasion of them was that heavy Visitation,
which was then upon your City; the drift of one
part of them, was to moove his auditors, to commi∣serate
the (then) wofull estate of it, to you there∣fore
as a Citizen (of no meane note) have I directed
them, but principally to you as my Patrone I have
not, nor expect anything of mine owne worthy pu∣blique
view: this I owne not as Authour, but as
Heire to the Authour: and it being in mine hands,
I thought it my duty (being the first booke▪ I had to
dispose of) to present it first into those hands,
which freely bestowed the Presentation to this Par∣sonage
upon me. I have beene for above these foure
yeeres, covetous of some faire opportunity to wit∣nesse
to the world, my thankfull acknowledgement
of your favour to me; and to give publique testimo∣ny
of your worthy and exemplary integrity, in dis∣charging
the trust reposed in you (to dispose of this

Benefice) without respect to your owne gaine, or
pleasuring of your friends, neglecting bribes of
breath or money. You intended not to enrich your
selfe by this part of the Churches Patrimony, nor to
make up other losses by gaining by this. It was
your care not onely to shunne the grievous sinne of
Simony and corruption, but to avoide all suspiti∣on
of it, you passed by the neere relation of kindred,
the importunate solicitation of freinds, the mediati∣on
of great Personages, and were pleased in your
choice to crave the direction of your pious, learned
and most industrious Pastour, the great blessing and
ornament of your City and Parish: his love (which
I may never forget, though I shall not in
any degree requite) induced him to nominate mee,
your confidence in his judgement and uprightnesse,
made you upon his commendation to make choice of
mee a meere straunger, for your Clarke. Never
had any Parson or Parish more cause thankfully
to acknowledge the religious care, and pious inte∣grity
of a Patrone, then wee heere have:
or take any occasion to lay this your good worke
open to wide report, and to propound you as
a patterne, to them that are entrusted with
such charges. I doe and shall praise GOD,
as long as I live, for raising you (beyond

my thoughts and expectations) an instrument of
so great good to mee: by your meanes hee hath
freed mee from those snares, wherein many of our
coate are (in these corrupt times) intangled▪ I doe
not eate the bread of (either direct or indirect)
Simony, but that which by GODS providence,
your uncorrupt hand hath reached out to mee, a
morsell of which will give mee more content,
then abundance of the former sort. I doubt not,
but GOD will aboundantly requite your kind∣nesse
to his house, that hee will blesse you in your
Merchandise, and exchanges, who have beene so
carefull not to make Merchandise of the Soules of
men, or to make sale of the Patrimony of the
Church, and portion of GODS Ministers;
that hee will continue and increase your comfort
in your hopefull children, who have beene so faith∣full
a Guardian to this people; but principal∣ly
that hee will blesse you in your Soule with
Spirituall and Heavenly graces and com∣fort,
the meanes of which, you have beene
so carefull to provide for this place. For
all which (as I hope) soe I shall continual∣ly
pray; and such prayers are the best,
and onely requitall, I can make, and
that I know, which you will accept

of, together with this mine acknowledge∣ment,
before witnesse, and upon record, that
I am
West-Felton in Salop.
