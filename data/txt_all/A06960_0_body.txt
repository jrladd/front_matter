THE zeale (most excellent Lord)
which in my soule hath euer
beene deuoted to your seruice,
intangl'd with your honorable fauors
to mine vnable deseruings, hath giuen
fier to my hart, & wings to my young∣ling
Muse, to raise her leaden humor
aboue the ordinarie pitch of her dull
Anthems, and sing of a subiect, the

height of whose action, might, if I
had might, make my verse most migh∣tie,
graunt then (renowned Lord) that
thine eyes may lighten on my layes,
and thy graces keepe from scandall my
poore wydowed Orphan: pyttie re∣nowned
Grinuile, in his death-re∣nowning
hower, & excuse his rough
Poet, whose sences are vnshapt, for
more softer melodie, so shall hee liue
happie, and I vnfaultie; both satisfied.
