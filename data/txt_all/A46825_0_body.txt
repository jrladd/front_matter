My Lord,
NOthing but your Lordships Commands could have forced into the Light this Discourse of so hasty conception, and they give some countenance to the con∣fidence of this Dedication, otherwise I am too conscious that nothing of mine can deserve the Patronage of so great a Name
or Title; nor do I hope for Acceptance of this Service, further than it is a Testi∣mony of my Obedience, and bears some (though faint) Characters of your late dear Consort. That the Piety and Vir∣tue of that excellent Lady may still live in your Noble Family (of which there are visible hopes largely promising) and consequently the Blessing of it on your Posterity reach the utmost extent of the Promise to such Obedience, shall be a considerable part of the constant Devo∣tions of,
My Lord,
