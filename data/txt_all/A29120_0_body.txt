My Lord,
IT is not my business, nor inten∣tion in this Paper-praesent, to set out all Caesars dues, or duties; but as a Subject under your High∣ness government, and a friend and

servant to the Commonwealth, whereof I am a Member, to do mine own. It is a businesse concerning which I have formerly acquainted your Highnes with some things in theCol. Goffe, Lieut. Col. Worsley, and Mr. Scobel Clark of the Council. general; and since that, some others appointed by your Highness to take the cognisance of it in particular; and it is at this present before the Commissioners for discoveries at VVorcester-house: But as the presence of the Sun obscures all other lesser lights, and makes them burn more dimly, so the assembling of the present Parliament doth in a man∣ner suspend and supersede all vigo∣rous actings of derivative and infe∣our powers: And therefore I have made bold to make this address im∣mediatly unto your self, and to pre∣sent unto your Highness own hand and view, in short, and yet in full too, the whole substance of the matter, with the grounds and reasons of it;

shewing the legality, equity, justice, and necessity of it, that you may at your leasure deliberately consider of it, and the more confidently resolve what to do in it. It is the unhappi∣ness of great Princes, that they must see with other mens eyes, and hear with other mens ears; In this I de∣sire your own may be Judges. And now, my Lord, I shall humbly crave your favourable protection in the of∣fer of this proposal, and the further pursute of it, if any further pursute be made in it: For although it speaks nothing but Law and Reason, Equi∣ty and Antiquity; yet what enter∣tainment it may probably meet with when it comes abroad, both the title and the subject of it may promise and presage, even such as all subjects of this nature do usually find, to be un∣welcom; yet truly there are none of those that are most concern'd in it, but upon conference, when they have

rightly understood my mind in it, and their own Case, they have gone away wellsatified; but, my Lord, they will be better satisfied, if in con∣sideration of those great sums your Highness is to receive out of the Church-revenues, so freely and so firmly by law conferr'd upon you, your Highness will be pleased to protect them in all the rest, and to settle upon the Church, and confirm un∣to it her antient portion and patri∣mony, the Tithes, & to put them into a better capacity of demanding and receiving them, than now they are in, when men will pay them but what they list, and if they do but demand their dues of them in a legal way, presently they are threatned with e∣jectment, which (as things now stand with them) is no hard matter to com∣pass, considering the many pins up∣on which their standing doth de∣pend, and the world of exceptions,

which the Commissions, Proclamati∣ons, Orders, and Ordinances made concerning them (if stretch'd upon the tenters, to the extremity of them, and acted upon with rigour) make them liable unto; besides, many of those which are their Judges in these cases being of different judge∣ments from them in matters of Re∣ligion, and ways of worship, and di∣rectly principled, not only against their persons, but even against their very callings and the payment of Tithes, out of which their liveli∣hood, and your Highnesses revenue should arise, the continuance where∣of is the only way of perpetuating the Ministry, in the Church; and which once taken away, it will in∣evitably follow, that in short space the Ministry will be utterly ruined and rooted out of the Church of England, and that once down, all other Ordinances fall with it, which

it is your highest honour to protect, and to uphold; but leaving those matters to your Higness wise∣dom and care, with the contributi∣on of my prayers to the great God of Heaven and Earth, the high dispo∣of all things, for his blessed protecti∣on, direction, and assistance, to be ever present with you in all your Great, Noble, High, Wise, and Religious undertakings, I passe to the businese intended, and subscribe as above,
