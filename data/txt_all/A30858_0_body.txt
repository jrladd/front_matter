THat the Fathers joy at the returning of a Spend-thrift Sonne, ought to have an influence upon the whole Family of Heaven and Earth, that is called after his name, to worke their suitable affections, and con∣formity to himselfe, cannot be que∣stioned by any true childe thereof. Behold then, Right Honourable, a call thereunto, Poore Prodigalls, who have not only with our selves lost that rich Treasure of grace and holinesse, wherewith in our Common roote and Fountaine we were entrusted, but also in a course of Rebellion for many Generations wasted the remainder of Natures Riches to the utmost degenera∣cy that an Immortall rationall being is obnoxious un∣to, not returning a farre off, but rejoycing in the imbraces of their Father, and enterteined with his flesh and bloud, who was slaine and sacrificed for them.
The ayme of our walking with God here is to come up to some conformitie to them, who behold
his face and doe his Will in Heaven: amongst them there is joy at the Repentance of one Sinner, and shall not wee finde sweetnesse in the first fruits of a barren Wildernesse in the shining of a beame of light into the darknesse of another World, giving hope of a plentifull harvest, and a glorious day to ensue. Let men take heed, lest by despising the day, and oppo∣sing the Worke of the Lord towards those poore Sonnes of Adam, notwithstanding all their zealous profession, they proclaime themselves to pursue a Carnall Interest; by which they declare the enlarge∣ment of the Dominion of Jesus Christ is of no Con∣cernment unto them.
Wee are by many Pledges assured better things of you Right Honourable, and such as accompany zeale for the House of our God, and therefore the ensuing Testimonialls of the progresse of the Worke of the Gospel being sent unto us, wee make bold humbly to present them to you; partly that we may invite you as the friends of Jesus Christ, to rejoyce with him that some sheepe of his, who were lost, are found; and partly to lay before you, some such fruits of the putting forth of your Authoritie for the carry∣ing on this most glorious undertaking, as may encou∣rage you to goe on through him who doth enable you unto future reall expressions of your love and zeale thereunto. Wee shall not need to draw forth any particulars from the ensuing Narrative, to give you a taste of that Spirit whereinto these poore Crea∣tures are sweetly baptized; Wee hope your delight in the Worke of God will inforce a leasure, to view the whole, this in Generall wee may say, that in the Wildernesse are waters broken out, and streames in the Desert, the parched ground is become a Poole,
and the thirsty Land-springs of water in the Habita∣tion of Dragons, where each lay, there is grasse with Reeds and Rushes, the Lord hath powred water upon him that is thirstie, and flouds upon the dry ground; He hath powred his Spirit on the seeds of the Heathen, & his blessing on their Off-spring, they spring up as among the grasse, as willowes by the wa∣ter-courses: One sayes I am the Lords, and another calls himselfe by the name of Jacob, and another sub∣scribes with his hand unto the Lord, and sirnames himselfe by the name of Israel. The Lord hath done a new thing, and wee know it, he hath made a way in the Wildernesse, and Rivers in the Desert, the beast of the feild doth honour him, the Dragons, and the Owles because he gives waters in the Wildernes, and Rivers in the Desert, to give drinke to his People his chosen, so that upon the Report heere read unto us, wee cannot but glorifie God with those Primitive beleevers of old, and say, then hath God also to the poore naked Indians granted Repentance unto life. Their outward wants and streights have often been presented unto you; wee shall not need to repeate them, blessed be the Lord, and blessed be you of the Lord that your hearts have been stirred up to give encouragement unto this Worke, and to open a Doore for the reliefe of those Eminent Instruments in the hand of the Lord who carry it on, who though they communicate to them Spiritualls, yet are so farre from receiving of their Temporalls, that they impart unto them a Portion of their owne dayly bread, and provision necessary from their owne subsistence.
The good Lord lay the weight and concernment of this Worke upon your spirits, and wee no way doubt that you will in any way be wanting to the Publique
improvement of this blessed opportunitie, for the en∣largement of the Kingdome of him whom our Soules doe love: There is a vexation of spirit, which through their formalitie and unbeliefe, hath encompassed ma∣ny Professors, that whereas they have with much seeming earnestnes cryed out for mercies; when they have been bestowed, they have thought scorne of them: so did the Jewes in the busines of their Messias, and many at this day amongst our selves in the great workes of the Provinces of God: It is so with some to this breaking forth of light amongst the Indians, de∣siring it before it began, despising it in its very begin∣nings, the Lord lay it not unto their charge, and keep all our spirits in an holy admiration and reverence of the powerfull efficacy of his eternall and unchange∣able purposes, which through so many sinfull Gene∣rations (falling in their Rebellion) have preserved a seed to himselfe, whereof he will take care that one graine fall not to the Ground.
