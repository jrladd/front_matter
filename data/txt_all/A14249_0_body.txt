SIR,
AT our parting from London to vnder∣take our sadde Peregrination into the Countrey, (amongst our Friends who are hard to be found) It plea∣sed you to bestow vpon vs a free and Noble Farewell. We remember it with thanks, which cuts off the sinne of Ingratitude; yet because Thankes, is but one word, and that your loue cannot receiue a Requitall but in many, wee send you a little bundle of Papers, full. For be∣ing Abusde in a Booke Printed at London, in which we were called Runne-awayes, Wee in this our Defence request you to be an Arbiter, to Iudge, whether we haue not iust cause, to stand


then promisde. Bid him therefore send all his Paper-Kites flying from his Stall, quite through the Citie, and from one Eude to th'other to giue notice of this our Answere. Bid him likewise to tell all Stationers, who haue any of those Bookes (called A Rodde for Run-awayes) that it were good for 'em to sell them a∣way as fast as they can, for when wee come to Towne, they shall be All callde in.
Farewell.
