May it Please your Excellency,
ROME, who in for∣mer
Ages was both
Holy and Orthodox,
s now corrupted not only in

Her Manners, but also in
Her Doctrine. Yet She is so
Confident, as to accuse of
Impiety and Heresie all the
Protestant Churches of Eng∣land,
Holland, Germany, and
other Countries; and perem∣ptorily
affirm, unless they be
of Her Communion, they
must never expect to be sav'd.
And so I may say without
any passion, that She is like
those Lewd and Naughty
Women, who quarrelling
with those, that are Honest,
do immediately call them
infamous and opprobrious
Names, lest the same should
be justly retorted upon Them∣selves.
I do not here intend
to speak of the Vices of the

Church of Rome, since most
of 'em, to our Shame, are
too frequently found amongst
us; I will only make mention
of Her Tyrannies, Idolatries
and Heresies, which, thanks
be to God, are not yet seen
in Reformed Churches, and
were the true Reasons, why
I left my Native Country,
and came hither to live and
end my days.
I know a different Constru∣ction
will be made by the
Papists, as also by some Pro∣testants;
for, as St. Paul, be∣ing
newly converted to the
Christian Religion, was not
only hated by the Jews, some
of them making an Oath,
they would neither, eat nor

drink, till they had kill'd him;
but even was suspected by the
Apostles themselves, who
were for some time afraid to
converse with him. So when
a Man leaves the Errors of
the Church of Rome, and em∣braces
the Truths of the Pro∣testant
Religion, then all the
Zealots of his former Opi∣nion
do presently Anathema∣tize
him; and those, who
were his most intimate
Friends, become his greatest
Enemies. And that, which
most aggravates his Trouble,
is, that the Protestants, a∣mongst
whom he came to se∣cure
himself, do commonly
doubt of the Sincerity of his
Conversion, and are very shy

of putting Confidence in him.
He that has powerful Ene∣mies,
stands in need of a
mighty Protection; and this
is the reason, My Lord, why
I do here, under God, implore
yours; which I do not in the
least question, since you are
an Enemy to the Romish Er∣rors,
and have a great Love
for the Truth of the Refor∣med
Religion, and no less
Tenderness and Affection for
them, that couragiously de∣fend
it.
The Three Sermons, I
have lately presented to your
Excellency, were so kindly
receiv'd, that I thought, I
was obliged upon the first
opportunity to make some ac∣knowledgment

to your Ex∣cellency
by dedicating this
small Treatise. I should not
offer you a Present of so little
value, had I not this to en∣courage
me, that it is not the
Gift, but the Intention in
giving, which finds acce∣ptance
with Great and Gene∣rous
Minds.
I do not here intend to at∣tempt
an enumeration of all
your excellent Qualities. I
will only say, that every one
admires your solid Judgment,
extraordinary Prudence, and
wise Conduct in the high
Places you are in, as well as
in all the Affairs you under∣take,
either Publick or Pri∣vate;
that England doth find

in you both Equity and Inte∣grity
in the Administration of
Justice; and that our very
Prudent, and most Generous
King William, having chosen
you amongst so many Lear∣ned
Lawyers to be Chancel∣lor
of England, one of the
Lords of his most Honoura∣ble
Privy-Council; and one
of the Lords Justices of Eng∣land,
during his Absence, is a
certain Proof of your Merits,
and the best Commendation
of your eminent Virtues.
These Virtues, My Lord,
will render your Name Im∣mortal
to Posterity, and will
leave a lively Idea of your Re∣nown,
which will serve to in∣fluence
your Example to all

succeeding Ages. I abhor
Flattery, but I love Justice;
and in all that I have said here
to your Excellency, every bo∣dy
is obliged to declare, or
with Silence give their Con∣sent,
that I only give Honour
to whom Honour is due.
I ask your Excellency's Par∣don,
for the Liberty I have
taken. I pray God Almighty,
that you may live long and
healthful in the high Places,
wherein you so worthily ac∣quit
yourself. I wish you
every thing, that may contri∣bute
to make you intirely
Happy in this World; and,
when in the other you are
call'd at the Judgment-Seat of
our Lord Jesus Christ, you

may hear these comfortable
words; Come you Blessed of my
Father, inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you from the Foun∣dation
of the World. It is, and
shall be, as long as I live, the
earnest Prayer of him, that
is with Sincerity and Respect,
