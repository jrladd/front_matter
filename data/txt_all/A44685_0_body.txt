IT was, Madam, the Character
an ancient Worthy in the
Christian Church gave of a noble
person of your Sex, that, in refe∣rence
to the matters of Religion she
was not only a Learner, but a
Judge. And, accordingly, he in∣scribes
to her divers of his writings
(even such as did require a very

accurate judgment in the reading
of them;) Which remain, unto this
day, dispersedly, in several parts
of his works, dignify'd with her
(often prefixed) name.
A greater, indeed, than he, men∣tions
it as an ill character, to be not
a doer of the Law, but a Judge. It
makes a great difference in the ex∣ercise
of the same faculty, and in
doing the same thing, with what
mind and design it is done.
There is a judging, that we may
learn, and a judging, that we may
not. A judgment subservient to
our duty, and a judgment oppo∣site
to it. Without a degree of the
former no one can ever be a serious
Christian. By means of the latter,

many never are. The World
through wisdom knew not God.
A cavilling litigious wit, in the
confidence wherof any set themselves
above their Rule, and make it their
busines only to censure it, as if they
would rather find faults in it, than
themselves, is as inconsistent with
sincere piety, as an humbly judi∣cious
discerning mind is necessa∣ry
to it.
This proceeds from a due savour
and relish of divine things, peculiar
to them, in whom an heavenly spi∣rit
and principle have the posses∣sion,
and a governing power. They
that are after the Spirit, do sa∣vour
the things of the Spirit.
The other from the prepossession

and prejudice of a disaffected car∣nal
mind. They that are after the
flesh, do only savour the things
of the flesh.
The ability God hath endow'd
your Ladiship with to judge of the
Truth that is after godliness, is
that you are better pleas'd to use,
than hear of. I shall therefore be
silent herein, and rather displease
many of them that know you, who
will be apt to think a copious sub∣ject
is neglected, than say any thing
that may offend either against your
Ladiships inclination or my own.
Here is nothing abstruse and dif∣ficult
for you to exercise a profound
judgment upon; nor any thing cu∣rious
to gratifie a pleasant wit. But

plain things, suitable to you, upon
accounts common to the gene∣rality
of Christians, not that are
peculiar to your self. 'Tis easie
to a well-temper'd mind, (of how
high intellectual excellencies soever)
to descend to the same level with the
rest; when for them to reach up to
the others pitch, is not so much
as possible.
Our heavenly Father keeps not
(as to the substantials of our nutri∣ment)
distinct tables for his Chil∣dren,
but all must eat the same
spiritual meat, and drink the same
spiritual drink. He hath not one
Gospel for great wits, and another
for plainer people; But as all that
are born of him must meet at

length in one end, so they must all
walk by the same rule, and in the
same way, thither.
And when I had first mentioned
this Text of Scripture in your
hearing, the savour you exprest to
me of the subject, easily induc'd
me, when, afterwards, I reckon'd a
discourse upon it might be of com∣mon
use, to address that also (such
as it is) in this way, to your Lady∣ship.
Accounting the mention of
your name might draw the eyes of
some to it, that have no reason to re∣gard
the Authors, and that, by this
means, if it be capable of proving
beneficial to any, the benefit might
be diffus'd so much the further.
The aptnes of the materials and

subject, here discourst of, to do good
generally, I cannot doubt. Neither
our present duty or peace; nor our
future safety or felicity can be pro∣vided
for as they ought, till our
minds be more abstracted from
time, and taken up about the un∣seen,
eternal World.
While our thoughts are too ear∣nestly
engaged about the events of
future time, they are vain, bitter,
impure, and diverted from our no∣bler,
and most necessary pursuits.
They follow much the temper and
bent of our Spirits, which are often
too intent upon what is uncertain,
and perhaps, impossible.
All good and holy Persons can∣not
live in good Times. For who

should bear up the Name of God in
bad, and transmit it to succeeding
times? Especially when good Men
are not of the same mind, it is impos∣sible.
And, more especially, when
they have not learn't, as yet, to bear
one anothers differences. The same
time, and state of things which
please some, must displease others.
For some, that will think them∣selves
much injur'd if they be not
thought very pious Persons, will be
pleased with nothing less, than the de∣struction
of them that differ from
them. So that while this is designed
and attempted only; generally, nei∣ther
sort is pleased, The One be∣cause
it is not done, The Other be∣cause
it is in doing.

It must be a marvellous alterati∣on
of Mens minds that must make
the Times please us all; while, upon
supposition of their remaining unal∣ter'd,
There is nothing will please
one sort, but to see the other Pagans,
or Beggars, who in the mean time
are not enough mortify'd either to
their Religion, or the necessary
accommodations of humane life,
as to be well pleas'd with either.
To trust God chearfully with the
Government of this World, and to
live in the joyful hope and expecta∣tion
of a better, are the only means
to relieve and ease us; and give
us a vacancy for the proper work
and busines of our present Time.
This is the design of the follow∣ing

discourses. The former whereof
is directed against the careful
thoughts, which are apt to arise in
our minds concerning the Events
of future Time, upon a fear what
they may be. The other, which
by way of Appendix is added to
the former, tends to repress the im∣moderate
desire of knowing what
they shall be.
Which latter I thought, in re∣spect
of it's affinity to the other, fit to
be added to it; and in respect of
the commonness, and ill tendency
of this Distemper, very necessary.
And indeed both the extreams in
this matter are very unchristian,
and pernicious. A stupid neglect
of the Christian Interest, and of

Gods Providence about it on the
one hand; And an Enthusiastick
Phrensie, carrying Men to expect
they well know not what? Or why?
on the other.
Our great care should be to serve
that Interest faithfully in our own
stations, for our little time, that will
soon be over. Your Ladiship hath
been called to serve it in a Family
wherein it hath long flourished. And
which it hath dignify'd, beyond all
the splendour that Antiquity and
Secular greatnes could confer upon
it. The Lord grant it may long conti∣nue
to flourish there, under the joint-influence
of your noble Consort,
and your own; And, afterwards,
in a Posterity, that may imitate

their Ancestors in substantial Piety,
and solid goodness.
Which is a glory that will not
fade, nor vary; not change with
times, but equally recommend it
self, to sober and good Men in all
times. Whereas that which arises
from the esteem of a Party can
neither be diffusive, nor lasting.
'Tis true that I cannot but rec∣kon
it a part of any ones praise
in a time wherein there are diffe∣rent
Sentiments and waies, in cir∣cumstantial
matters relating to Re∣ligion,
to encline most to that which
I take to come nearest the Truth
and our common Rule. But, as
was said by one that was a great
and early light in the Christian

Church; That is not Philosophy,
which is profest by this or that
Sect, but that which is true in
all Sects. So nor do I take that
to be Religion, which is peculiar
to this or that Party of Christi∣ans
(many of whom are too apt to
say here is Christ, and there is
Christ, as if he were divided)
but that which is according to
the mind of God among them
all.
And I must profes to have that
honour for your Ladiship, which
I sincerely bear, and most justly owe
unto you, chiefly upon the account
not of the things wherein you
differ from many other serious
Christians (though therein you

agree also with my self) as for
those things wherein you agree
with them all. Vnder which no∣tion
(and under the sensible Obli∣gation
of your many singular Fa∣vours)
I am
MADAM,
