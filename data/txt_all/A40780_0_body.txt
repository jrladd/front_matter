SIR,
THe Honour of having serv'd his
late Majesty (under your Con∣duct)
in the Garrison of Basing,
hath given me some reputation in the
World, and the happinesse of having
serv'd your self, before the Warrs, hath
given me a Condition of living in it. in
both, under the Regiment of your Com∣mand.
you chang'd the steel of my Tools
into Weapons, and the exercise of my
Arts into Arms; when the service of the
King challenged the duty of his Subjests,
you then prompted me unto Loyalty: that
service unhappily ending, you re-advised

a returne to my imployment: the whole
course of my life, having thus in some
measure been an Observancy of your Di∣rections,
to whom should I dedicate the
Issues of my Labours in it, but to you:
and having now to present my Countrey
with something of use, profit, and delight,
take occasion by these to speake my grati∣tude,
and preserve to my self the honour
of continuing what I have been,
Sir,
