Madam,
I Am surpriz'd betwixt Doubt and Duty;
The former, least I presume: The fol∣lowing,
least I fail. And as resolv'd, and
unresolv'd at once, I am dilemma'd, whether
it should live, or dye; I that am Judg dread
my own sentence, if I condemn it? Why did
I write it? If I reprieve it, I am a fool in
Print. Thus guilty, or not guilty, I must
suffer.
But Madam, I am at a favourable Barr,
and waving Merit, submit to Mercy; I have



heard of some, who by Themselves condemn'd,
have been by their Judges ; And who
can tell but I may find is  know ny
Cafe here  under the  of a 
Eye, and if Your Candour intercede not with
Your Justice? The Printer needs no Errata,
for the whole Copy  'tis left to Your
Correction, whose very escapes are perfecter
than the Original.
For the Dedication, (presumption set aside)
I thought it Equity, Madam, to make bold
with You, many of them being compos'd under
your Roof; being there the Subject of my fan∣cie,
where I my self was the Object of Your Fa∣vour.
And as Hares naturally return to te
their Ruine, where they took their Rise. So
these my Papers to dye at Sharington, where
they were born. If You vouchsafe this a par∣don,
It will be the last Error of this nature like
to be committed by
MADAM,
