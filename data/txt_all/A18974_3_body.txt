MY most honoured Lord, his Maiesties good Instructions and precepts beeing sufficient not on∣ly to moue your Lordship to ac∣knowledg and embrace the Truth, but also to continue constantly in the same, as your Glorious Ances∣toures haue done in vertuous No¦bility, I haue only designed these fewe advertismēts for your better confirmatiō, & for an essay of my particular affection towards your Honour. VVhat I cannot expresse in so short time, the same I point at breifly with my fin∣ger vntil a fitter occasion.
Verùm animo satis haec vestigia parua sagaci
Sunt, per quae possis cognoscere caetera tute.
Therfore I beseech your Lordships fauor to accept, read and retaine them with that same minde as they are offered; to incite you and al other young Nobles for ever to be aware of al erroneous doctrine and idolatrous superstition: to cleaue continually vnto our only true Ca∣tholick religion; wherin I signe my selfe.
