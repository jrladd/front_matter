SIR,
THat sweetness of temper I have had the Happiness to discover in the honour of your Company in the first place, and your favourable Opinion of my Play in the next, gives me Incouragement to claim your Prote∣ction.
I am often told, and always pleased when I hear it, that the Works not mine; but oh I fear your Closet view will too soon find out the Wo∣man, the imperfect Woman there. The story was true, and the action gave it Life; for I shou'd be very rude not to own each maintain'd their Character beyond my hopes. Then that pretty Ornament, the ingenious Dialogue, these might divert you at the Theatre, but these avail not me; the reading may prove tiresome as a dull repeated tale: Yet I have still recourse to what I mention'd first, your good nature, that I hope

will pardon and accept it. I only wish my self Mistress of Eloquence, Rhetorick, all the Perfecti∣ons of the Pen, that I might worthily entertain Mr. Minchall.
Your Noble Family has been long the Glory of my Native Country, and you are what I think no other Nation equals, a true English Gentle∣man, kind to the distressed, a Friend to all. I dare not proceed—my Weakness wou'd too plain∣ly appear in aiming at a Character which I can never reach: Therefore, I conclude, once more asking your Pardon, and leave to subscribe my self,
SIR,
