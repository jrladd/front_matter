Sir,
THis bold addresse is made, not to move for any secular
aide or armed assistance, either to maintaine the Ar∣guments, or mall the
adversary. The Catholick faith, (once delivered to the Saints) is a truth
which hu∣mane authority seldome understandeth, nor ever ought to change or
alter. Magistrates, in my conceit, may doe well to countenance what they
conceive to be right and Canonicall, so they doe not for the interest of
their own sense, by secular compulsion, suppresse all different
Opinionists, walking orderly in reference to the worlds po∣lity. When Kings
or Parliaments act otherwise, I am in great fear tis more for their own ends,
then advance of the faith, which as all other Religions may bee retained as an
instrument of tyranny, (so one of the Turks hath acknowledged) not as a
saving truth. And therefore I could not think, but that the late Parliament
incurred some reproach, in so casting this learned Opinionist into
Prison, con∣trary to the notorious example of some Calvinisticall
Magistrates in Geneva, medling with a more superlative Heretike,
Servitus the Spaniard, and quite against the moderation of such
able mn, as was that pious Bishop of Marseilles [Salvianus.] So
giving scan∣dalous advantage to our clamorous Adversaries, who conclude an
ab∣solute necessity of secular compulsion, subordinate to
Ecclesiasticall power, without the which, sects will abound, and baffle
the ablest of Bishoply Doctors; saying also, it is irrationall to
think, that these Arrian questions, can be definitively resolved, by a
criticall libra∣tion of dead and uncertaine words, as if in these
mysteries, the spi∣rit were not Gramatically plaine. Therefore deeming this
opinion better corresponding with the prophane and ignorant, then with the
pious and able in Scripture understanding; in the first place I hum∣bly
Petition your Highnesse that mine Adversary may be free to write what he
pleaseth, in answer to the Arguments, or for his own 
Assertion; for upon pretended feares they have refused the proffe¦red way
of giving and receiving just satisfaction, and in this faie way if I cannot wrap him up in such
apparent obstinacy against th
evidence of the word, as the indifferent must acknowledge, I
 then openly confesse mine
ignorance and presumption, knowing full well that in my defaylance, Christ
hath many others, with spirituall weapons sufficiently armed for the worke,
unto which they are called and excited by reason of the combate and
opposition of the contrary minded, which is an eminent effect of a fatherly
providence so pro∣voking truly pious soules to awake from that lethall
security wherein long tranquillity had plunged them: so that if wee counter
poyse the good accruing by these mens rousing of their zeale and forces,
with the losse sustained by others stragling out of the way, the
profit will at length surmount the prejudice by plain and Apodeicticall
Argu∣ments against all hereticall novelists, Phanaticke opinionists, and
Atheisticall Epochists, abounding heerabouts, who have Apostarized from
the primest reputation of strictest profession into the horrible
darkenesse of irreligion, making that very thing an unanswerable argument
for liberty; from the which, Papists, and some of our Pro∣testant
Grandees with a selfe confounding sottishness, do obstinately
assert compulsive authority: for this point throughly sifted will
in∣duce by degrees an orderly discussion of all these articles, wherein
he differeth from the unanimous consent of those who are called Or∣thodox,
and by a cleare reflexion serve to refell those hyperephani∣an fancies
which obey pride as a father; for hee is not to bee found, I feare, amongst
the phanaticke or new fangled, who had not rather bee leader of some
stragling troupe though in the path of perdition, then an humble Disciple
in the schoole of truth, evinced by Scrip∣ture evidence. But this and the
rest are humbly referred to your Highnes further examination, in a reverend
regard to your grati∣ous aequanimity & great ability to distinguish the
chiefest Argu∣ment of a prime magistrate, really apprehensive,
imperare liberis, which very thing to the Princes of this world
seemeth impossible.
