Worthy Sir;
WHere there is diuersitie of helpes, leading to
one Intention of good, the variety may well be
tolerated. Who findes fault with a Garden,
for the multitude of flowers? You shall per∣ceiue
heere different kinds; whereof (if some
to some seeme bitter) there is none vnwhole∣some.
It takes fire at the Altar of God, and beginnes with the
Christians Sacrifice: the flame wherof (by the operation of the
blessed Spirit) may both enlighten the vnderstanding, and
warme the affections of good men: and in others consumingly
waste the drosse and rust of sinne,Mat. 3. 11. 12. which must eyther be pur∣ged
by the fire of Grace heere; or sent to the euerlasting fire
to be burned. The Wisemens Oblation seconds it: what
is formerly commaunded in Precept, is heere commended in
Practise. The Politicke Hunters of the world are discoue∣red:
and Plaine-Dealing encouraged. One (almost forgotten
vertue) Charitie is praised; and a busie vice is taxed. In all
is intended Lux Scientiae, Pax Conscientiae; Peccati ru∣ina,
aedificatio Iustitiae.
Your noble endeuours are obserued by all eyes, to bee distin∣guished

into this method: from your vertues there is a resultance
of shining Light to information, from your Office to reformation
of others. Goe forward so still, to menage your Place in that ho∣nourable
Citie: and let the fire of correction eate out the rust
of corruption. You may punish, euen whiles you pitie. The good
Magistrate, like a good Chirurgion, doth with a shaking hand
search vlcers; more earnestly desiring Non inuenire quod
quaerit, quàm inuenire quod puniat. The God of mercie
and saluation wrappe vp your soule in the bundle of Life; and
(when the Lust of the earth shall to the Dust of the earth) fixe
you in the blessed Orbe of Glory.
