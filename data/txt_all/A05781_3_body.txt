NOble Kalendra Neece to Cynthia;
Endymion with all humilitie,
Sends to thy blessed selfe Oraa,
With her accomplished Philosophie,
Long kept she Greekish Ladies companie.
And thence arriued in Britannia,
Inquiring for Nymphs of high dignitie,
Great Pastorellas of Albania:
Tritonizing Fame blaz'd Dorobeiaâ–ª
Thrice renowmed, learned, religious,
Thy selfe, modest, vertuous, Hastinguia,
In the Garland of Nimphs illusrious:
High prized Branch of Noble Huntington,
Cherish Ourania, and grace Endymion.
