THis most Important Af∣fair, which concerns the Conversion of a Man to God, cannot better be offered to any Person, than to one that
manages the greatest Affairs of a Mighty Monarch; to the Glory of his God, to the Credit and In∣terest of his Prince, to the Ho∣nour and Repute of the Nation, to the gladding of the hearts of all good Subjects therein, and the Terrour of Offenders; to his own Immortal praise here, and Immortal Felicity hereafter, with universal, steady, unshaken Loy∣alty, Justice and Integrity; It is, to speak in short, most agreeable for one that is the Quintessence of all Excellencies, both Divine and Humane.
The boldness which I have to present this Book to your Ho∣nour,
doth not only bid me hope for Excuse, but also promise my self that your Honour will re∣ceive it according to your wont∣ed Noble and Generous Con∣descention, being your Poor Of∣ferer tenders it with the Pro∣foundest Reverence and Respects imaginable.
I humbly pray your Lordship to take both my Self and Book to your Honours Protection; and it shall be my daily Prayers to Almighty God, to take under his Especial Charge your Honours Person, and under his Especial Conduct all your Honours Acti∣ons; so that both may be accep∣table
to his Divine Majesty, and his Majesty of Great Britain, and to all true English Spirits; be∣ing,
My Lord,
