My Lord,
I should not have presumed to Prefix so
great a Name as that of your Lordship,
to so small a thing as this Sermon, were
it not an Accessary to the Memorial which I

once humbly offered, and which your Lord∣ship
had the Goodness to lay before His Ma∣jesty
and Council, when a Motion was made
for the Establishment of a Fixed and Se∣dentary
Chaplain to this GARRI∣SON:
The want whereof seems to have
had much Influence on the Evils complained
of by our Deputies last Year, and set forth
in the ensuing Discourse. For had the
Soldiers here in GARRISON
been well instructed in the Duties of their
Profession, by one appointed to attend con∣tinually
upon this very thingRom. 13. 6., I
am apt to think they had not run out into
the Excesses they have amongst us.
My Lord, You are Excellently fitted,
both by Inclination, and that high Station
to which your noble Birth and great Virtues
have raised you, to do Good: And perhaps

never any in the like Circumstances did more,
nor hath more generally Obliged all sorts of
Persons. But there is one Capacity where∣in
your Lordship may do much Good to this
poor Island. It is th of PRIVY-COUNCELLOR.
That most
Honourable Board are our Judges in the
last Resort: Their Orders are our Laws:
And to them we apply for Redress of our
Wrongs. Pardon me, My Lord, if be∣ing
a Native of this Island, and having so
many reasons to be concerned for its Well∣fare,
I humbly crave your Lordship's Fa∣vour,
and Protection to it.
I had once thought to have added a short
Scheme, or Account of it, by way of Ap∣pendix
to this Sermon; both to explain some
Passages in the Sermon, and to gratifie the
Curiosity of many who (I know) would

be glad to be informed of our Constitution
But I had rather leave it to better Hands,
which are not wanting amongst us. I am,
My Lord,
Jersey Apr. 22.
1692.
Your Lordship's
Most Humble and
Most Obliged Servant,
