TO lay aside (right Honourable) all the officious com∣plements, vsed by most men now a∣daies to make way for the purcha∣sing of the fauour of high and e∣minent

Personages; What your Lordship is to me, J my selfe know best: neither will J expose it to the view of Buyers, it being vn∣vendible, yea, vnestimable. J offer to your Lordships favoura∣ble Patronage this little Treatise of lamentable Dissentions, neuer (for ought I know) heeretofore collected into one Packet: and as yet rather a Rapsodie, then a Methodicall Relation of Diffe∣rences. Your Lordship loueth V∣nion; This emboldeneth me. Your Lordsh. hateth Schisme, for which I heartily thanke God, beseeching him vpon the very bended knees of my soule, that you and all such, eminent in Learning, Wisedome, and Pietie, may by all meanes

possible endeauour to helpe to pull downe these ill-composed walls of Schisme, and to reare vp the beautifull and long-desired wall of Peace. God preserue your Honour, increase your Wealth, and restore you fully to your for∣mer Health.
