Right Honourable,
SInce I had the happinesse imputed to Salomons Seruants by the Queene of Sheba, to stand sometimes before You, an eye and eare witnes of your Noble conuersation with the worthy Earle of Deuonshire, (my deceased Lord and Master,) I euer admired your vertues and much honoured your Person. And because it is a thing no lesse commendable, gladly to receiue fa∣uours from men of eminent worth, then with like choice to ten∣der respect and seruice to them: I being now led by powerfull custome to seeke a Patron for this my Worke; and knowing that the weakest frames need strongest supporters, haue taken the boldnes most humbly to commend it to your Honours protection: which vouchsafed, it shall triumph vnder the safegard of that massy shield; and my selfe shall not only acknowledge this high fauour with humblest thankefulnesse, but with ioy imbrace this occasion to auow myselfe now by publike profession, (as I haue long been in priuate affection,)
