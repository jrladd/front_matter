My Lords,
YOur Lordships pleasure is the sole producent of the publication of this Sermon, which therefore makes lowly address to your most honou∣rable House, that seeing your will hath given it a publick existence, it may not lie idle and fruitless in open view, but remain a lively and lasting monument of true thankefulness, by your Lordships good example and precedence.
My Lords, though in this juncture of the greatest benefits, the whole King∣dom is bound, more than any Nation, to be thankeful, yet in the common bles∣sings the Peers are especially obliged to gratitude, by reason that others suffer∣ed with you, onely in their estates, your Lordships alone suffered in your Honors. The forces, that so far as in them was, abolisht Kingship, put Peerage down as useless, and left you bare titles of honor without influences of activity in your sphere of government: and no wonder, when the fountain of honour was obstru∣cted, that the riverets should be dried up, when the Crown did not flourish, how could the Coronet? The Moon would go for an obscure body, if by monethly re∣turns she were not replenisht with new light from the Sun: During the Kings eclipse your Honors were under a cloud, but by a renewed conjunction with his Majesty, your titles of honor be significant, your lustre is repair'd, your beams chear your country, and you act the prime part in the grand Council and af∣fairs of State. Sad experience may serve for a remembrance that the concern∣ment of the Nobility is to keep up Majestie, for the King cannot be lessened in his legal rights and prerogative, but the Nobles will be diminished in their na∣tive priviledges and dignities. My Lords, considering how easie it was with God to lay the highest honors low, even by and under contemptible creatures, now that his favour shines again upon you, let ingenuity perswade your Lord∣ships to walk officiously with our dear Lord, and sacrifice thankofferings besee∣ming Christian grace and English grandeur; in which kind Almighty God throughout his Law calls for regard of the poor, respect to the Levite: On be∣half of the poor, I beseech you give me leave to remind your Lordships what floud-gates of sin it will stop, and what a door it will open for amending the manners of the most necessitous, and the trayning up their infantry to industry and vertue, to anticipate all begging by fit relief, and setting all able hands to
some task towards their living. There be indeed excellent laws already to this purpose, but nevertheless I am an humble suppliant to your Lordships, that a course may speedily be took for a possibility to effectuate those laws, by work∣houses and sufficient stocks in these populous and wealthy cities, from which the pattern will soon issue forth into all the land. As for due countenance to the Levite, I held it neither opportune nor needful to sollicit your Lordships in my Preaching, because the propensity and inclination of your noble Souls is transpa∣rent, that His Majesty shall no sooner be repofed in his regalities, and the Kingdom resetled in its laws and liberties, but your Honors will shew your selves munificent Patrons and providers for the Church, and the reverend Fathers and very learned Ministers thereof, that be supervivors, to the manifold suffer∣ings and injuries, which have been illegally inflicted on them these twenty years by-past: Undoubtedly the estimate of a Clergy cannot be upheld without en∣dowments, benefits and salaries, whereby some eminent Divines may proceed equal to the most famous of other liberal Sciences, in their rewards and perqui∣sites; otherwise the finest wits and brave spirits will betake themselves to other professions, if Physicians for the body advance higher than any Physicians for the soul, and if the Gospel cannot prefer as much as the Law: How can your Lordships wish a learned, pious and painful Ministry in every corner of the Realm, unless a competency be fore-prepared for their maintenance and encou∣ragement? Wherefore when once your Lordships shall have re-established the fundamentals of the State, you will credit your memories in all posterity, to ac∣commodate the Church with necessaries for decency of degree in Church-men, and contrive a bountiful conveniency for the Pastor of every parish, by uniting small adjacent Livings and like expedients, which so wise a Council will not fail quickly to find out, when they intend it as a serious piece of their business. For which provisions for the poor in honest labor, and for Ecclesiasticks in god∣ly work, your Honors shall inherit the benediction of the Church, and the bles∣sings of the poor, (two notable promises in holy Scripture) together with the prayers and praises of all Gods people, and the faithful services and devotions of,
My Lords,
