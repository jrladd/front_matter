DEarest Sister, for any so meane as
my selfe to prefixe a Dedication to
so worthie a mans worke as this is,
is a bouldnesse little inferior to pre∣sumption
it selfe. But the Copie
being bestowed vpon me by a worthie Friend of
mine (farre more able) who would not himselfe
take that office vpon him; Principally to let you
know, how faine I would shew my gratitude to
you, whose debtor I haue euer bin; & well know∣ing
your well knowne zeale to deuotions of this
straine, To you I dedicate (before all others) this
sacred Tractate; Of your acceptation of it, I doubt
not; But my desire is that you would accept also
the loue of him that can no wayes else (as yet) giue
your deseruings better satisfaction, then by remai∣ning.
