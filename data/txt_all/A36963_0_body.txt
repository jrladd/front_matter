My LORD,
THE Diversion that Collin has al∣ready had the good Fortune to give your Lordship at some times of leasure, (when being retir'd from pub∣lick Affairs you have honour'd me with your Conversation) makes him now presume to throw himself at your Feet, and withal, ingages me to appear in his behalf, Your Lordships most hum∣ble Petitioner: The little time of his being in Town, has not at all hin∣der'd him from the perfect Knowledge of your Character; that noble Nature,

and uncommon Goodness, that gene∣rally influences and obliges not only those whose Merits have qualified 'em for such an Honour; but even others whose Malice and Folly have justly deserv'd your Contempt and In∣dignation; cannot be without the Ex∣tremity of base and partial Ingratitude, exempted from general Applause; and amongst the rest, has likewise so charm'd the Heart and Understanding of Poor Collin, that he rather chooses to renounce the whole Body of Presbytery, by ex∣posing their Frailties to promote your Mirth, than endanger the misfortune of losing that part of your Lordships Favour, which his benign Stars have already far beyond his Merit blest him with.
Nor am I, my Lord, tho a Petitione for him, the less an humble Mediator fo my Self: This BOOK with which present your Lordship, and which

confess was not design'd to please all Parties, having much the greater oc∣casion to make its Court to you, 'tis my Happiness to know your Lordship to be of a clear and genuine Under∣standing, not sullied by the Town-Vices, of Malice, or unreasonable Criti∣cism, tho capable of judging with the Wisest and most Correct, you will rather convince a Poet of his Error, by an easie Argument, than endeavour to raise the Structure of your own Wit, by crying down his, when he is out of your sight; And as your Generous In∣clination to Arts, especially those of Poetry and Musick, incline you rather to favour and instruct, than detract or reprove a Professor; so 'tis impossible for the Muses to do themselves greater Justice or Honour, than to implore the Patronage of a Nobleman, so per∣fectly qualified, whose Soul agrees with Science by Sympathy, and whose admirable Vertue of good Nature, in∣fluences

the Poetick Art like another. Apollo, and rather plants the Lawrel more firmly, than tears it from the Brows of any deserving Author.
The Satyrical Part of my Poem need not offend any one that is Wise enough not to expose himself: My Lines being (as the Eternally Famous Butler once said before,) like Sales∣mens Cloths, made for them only that they will fit; and with the same limit as Iuvenal allows his Satyrs:
Quicquid agunt homines, votum timor, ira, voluptas, Gaudia, discursus, nostri farrago Libelli est.
Your Lordships stedfast Opinion in Favour of the Church of England, gives me hopes you will be pleas'd the more with my exposing her Enemies; the Illustrious Stock from which you have your Being, giving you daily a

noble Example of constant Candor for our Religion, as well as tender Love for your Country; that flourishing Cedar that has already adorn'd the Garden of one of our most lov'd and greatest Mo∣narchs, and now by Sacred Provi∣dence transplanted into the Bosom of a second, no less affected and rever'd, do's not only appear the Courts chiefest Or∣nament, but its greatest Blessing; the spreading Vigor of his fasten'd Root, will make him still defie the Storms of Malice, and stand in spight of For∣tune, whilst the Indulgence of his Ge∣nuin shade, nobly refreshes those un∣grateful Creatures who pine to see his Height and Virdant Glory.
This Theme would almost draw me to a Rapture, did not a just Sense of my weak Abilities check my Presum∣ption: I shall therefore descend from that lofty Tract, to beg Pardon of your Lordship for this Prolixity, and prepare Collin to entertain you with his

Humor and Character, as also with the divertive Accidents in his several Walks, which I do assure your Lord∣ship are entirely new, and I hope will afford you the satisfaction I ex∣pect they should: The Wit and Style I humbly submit to your Lordships Judgment, with unusual Joy to fall in∣to such noble Hands, where I am sure to have generous Usage; your uncom∣mon Affability, sweet and unaffected Behaviour, and modest Treating your Inferiors, ingaging the Hearts of all that have the Honour to know you, as well as that of
My Lord,
