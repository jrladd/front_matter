RIGHT HONOURABLE,
ADVENTURERS (the Primum mobile of this Subject) whose Negotiations are dilated be∣yond the Suns annuall pro∣gresse, as both the Indies and Polar Stars can clearly witness; to your candid censures I address my self, as compe∣tent judges of Commerce and Trade; and to avoid obstructions from fond Informers (with license of the Court) I will render
 here a breviate of some occurrences, and the motive wherefore I have harboured this so long, not becalm'd, as some suppose. When first I fram'd this Abstract of Commerce and Trade, (and having shipt the chiefest Rules depending upon Arithmetick) I thought good to ballance them with Geo∣metricall Problems and Propositions of Magnitude, with sundry Questions mixt and appled to both those liberall Sciences. Thus fraught with variety (according to the Vessels capacity) rigg'd and made rea∣dy for a voyage to the publick prospect of the worlds inhabitants, indigent of Prote∣ctors for a Convoy, untill reflecting upon the Right Honourable Societies, under whose colours I weighed Anchor, and stood to Sea, willing to strike saile to men of Art, in Peace or War, yet scorning to submit unto a Fleet of vapouring Roman∣cers, or empty Liters, whose Top-sails are filled with vain glorious words: these ver∣ball Rovers (perhaps) will question and charge me of Piracy, or surreptitious Goods from manuall Trades, and ingenious Arti∣ficers.
To all rash and Malignant censurers I shall plead Not guilty; animated, that this no∣ble
 Consistory of Senators wil vindicate my endeavours, and write upon the Plantiffs Bill Ignoramus; since all Humane Know∣ledge depends upon Time (the Worlds grave Tutor) ratified by the sage experi∣ence of your selves and others: and as for these, they have been lawfully gained, se∣lected and recollected by my Industry, un∣der the conduct of Art, and registred upon the account of many years revolutions, ap∣plied to Practise, seconded by Reason, and inserted in this form, modeliz'd to my Sense, without prejudice, or intrenching my self upon any others Ground, Claime, Title, or Prerogative.
Neither have I set forth one Adventure (as some have done) and never appeared upon this Theatre again, nor heard of, as if exploded, or cast away at Sea by some e∣vil steered course, not Regulated by De∣monstration, shap'd by Experience, nor re∣ctified by Compasse, or lost by spreading too great a Saile, unable to stem a tu∣multuous current of the Times without a Pilot, Masters and Mates now termini covertibiles; yet notwithstanding them, the acceptance of my former Labours hath given me faire hopes of an Insurance for
 these purchased by Barter, Exchange, or the expence both of Time and Money, transported from severall Regions, under your protection now arrived and delivered out, for the benefit or pleasure of others.
My request is (worthy Patrons in this Metropolis of Trade) that ye will signe these with your Magisteriall Impressions, and condescend to owne my Adventure, although intended as a guide to young be∣ginners onely, and to attend your vacant hours, as an Index to your memories, and a Directory to your dilated courses, since Nature hath provided the biggest Whale but a little Pilot, and Art a small Rudder, to steere the greatest Ship. From hence if this may find a reception in your Socie∣ty, the Charges are all defrayed, but Cu∣stome to the Stationers Office, my inten∣tions (to a serene Auditor) will ballance the other Accounts, and the next Voyage or Return, the Tare and Errours shall be deducted, and ye (Noble Merchants) repre∣sented with an ampler Cargazone, if I be ad∣mitted, and this to your Patronage (which Hope bids me to believe) so I will subscribe myselfe,
