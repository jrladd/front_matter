SIth, when you daigned to
restore
Our Schoole deflowr'd,
defac'd before,
Your Favorite hee did commence,
And hansell your Munificence;
That of his Muse he well may call
You the maine Base, and Pedestall;
And a bad Debtor 'tis (they say)
That never can resolve to pay:

He, sir, (for his lanke Fortunes poore
Affords him now no better store)
In tender of his Service due,
This Moity presents to you,
(The firstlings of his Fruits) that will
Remaine
Your gratefull Hench-man still,
