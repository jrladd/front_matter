GRATIOVS SOVERAIGNE,
IF I were againe in Spaine, I should thinke no happinesse on Earth, so great, as to come into England, and at your Royall Feete, lay downe the Story of my Dangers, and Peregrination; Which I tell, as a late Sea-wrackt Man, (tos'd and beaten with many Misfortunes;) Yet, setting my weary Body at last on a Blessed Shore: My Handes now lay hold vpon your Altar, which is to me a San∣ctuary: Heere I am safe in Harbor.
That Psalme of Kingly Dauid, which I sung in my Spanish Captiuity,Psal. 137. (When as wee sate in Babilon, &c.) I now haue changed to an other

Tune; saying, (with the same Prophet, Great is thy Mercy towards me (O Lord,) for thou hast deliuered my Soule from the lowest Graue.Psal. 86.13. And, as your Maiesty hath bene gratiously pleased, both to let your poore Soldier and Subiect, behold your Royall Person, and to heare him speake in his rude Language; So, if your Maie∣sty, vouchsafe to cast a Princely Eye on these his vnhandsome Papers; New Sun-beames shall spread ouer him, and put a Quickning Soule into that Bosome, which otherwise must want Life, for want of your Comfort. Those Graces, from your Excellent Clemency, (already receiued) being such, that I am asha∣med, and sorry, not to haue Endur'd, and to haue done more in Forreigne Countries, for the Honor of Yours; When from so High a Throane, my Souereigne Deignes to looke Downe, on a Creature so vnworthy, whose Life, he prostrates before your Highnes.
