WEE are angariated (wee make bold with that Persian word, our English being so short in our seeming to expresse the enforce∣ment that lyeth upon us) com∣pelled, as one was to beare the Crosse, or as a tired horse to goe his Stage: so we to put-forth our matters, as we intend to doe one after another, for others to judge betwixt us and a Minister of Mr Hs perswasion in Reference to the Discipline of Gods House, free Admission of all to all Church-Communions; It is possible, and but after the manner of men, and more ordina∣ry with such as we are, to judge amisse of our own performances, too partially and fatherlike (for libri quasi liberi, books are like children) we o∣ver-look their faults, or we deal too tenderly with them, as others may too rashly and rigedly. There∣fore, as things now stand, the world must judge betwixt us, or as many of them as are fitted with patience to sit out the hearing of so meane matters,
 as they are acted by us, as mean as the meanest, and may be presented to their eye and eare in their or∣der and respective places; Meane we say as acted by us, but in their relation to the house of God, the Church of the living God, the management of matters by the Stewards there, they may appear to be matters high and Glorious, just according to the manner they are mannaged, if after the due order, then high and glorious, if otherwise, then low and inglorious.
Now be not discouraged, Reader at our mean∣nesse, though so meane wee are as thou canst think us. We would gladly suppose thee a blessed man; the bent of whose Spirit is such, that he cannot stirre or make the least motion against the Truth. And then it is a blessed comfort to this blessed man (to thee, if thou be hee) that though wee should put forth our strength, not ingorantly onely but wickedly (which through grace is as far from us, as wee would have that to be, which is an abo∣mination to us) against the truth, yet we shall ne∣ver prevail against it, which undoubtedly will be the great Conquerour at last, & is gaining every day luster and Glory by our most inglorious act∣ings against it. Questionless, it is ventilated win∣nowed and purged by the blastings of men of cor∣rupt
 minds upon it; surely it is cleared from the dross (which would cleave to it) passing through so many heated hands and fiery mouths, as so ma∣ny fining pots, though intended by man utterly to extinguish and consume it: oh the glorious advan∣tages truth hath gained all along these feirce and perilous times, while errour sate in state, or as we may say in its Throne, like to be, as might be con∣ceived by some, a perpetuall Dictator against it; It is the Lords doing, is it not marvelous in your eyes?
But to stay thee no longer, we come to our case, which, in brief, is this; we were desired (so wee would rather say than charged or commanded, wee should be judged else to walke by a fancy in the matters of our Lord) by a Minister of the same perswasion with a world (but argumentum pes∣simum turba, commonly the most are worst) of Ministers, to give our reasons for our dissent from him in point of free admission of all to all Church Communions upon account of their infant Bap∣tism; As also to the declaring against the obser∣vation of the day wee will call, because we would be understood, Christmas Day, in reference also to forms of prayer, and in speciall to the Lords prayer; and foure Queries thereupon; These foure
 Treatises, (for so wee have digested them) with three Epistles, together with an introduction hold∣ing forth by way of preface, the way of Christ with His people, and their walke with Him, by the guidance of his good Spirit in the directions of His Word, these, wee were saying, wee sent to the said Minister one after another, as wee could take a transcript of the same; some two months after he returned us the Epistles, Preface, and first Treatise of Baptisme, with some exceptions against some expressions or passages in all three; whereunto we thought our selves bound, upon the account of truth, to make some Reply, whereof you may be judge, if please you; For truely our Humours, or our principles, the one or both are so contrary, that though we are bound to judge our selves, yet neither must wee nor will wee be jud∣ged in our matters, though indeed we think them to be right, and well agreeing with the Word of God, if that said Minister fixed in Mr Hs way, and firme to his perswasion, be in an errour as to these matters.
Quickly after the receite of this our Reply to his exceptions, as aforesaid, he returned, together with that Reply, the three other Treatises (all he had or would receive from us, whereas there were
 three more in our hands, in a readinesse for him) with so much heate as might argue his spirit som∣what discomposed. Notwithstanding though some might think here was some offence given in re∣turning our Papers, wee expected no more than wee doe the returne of our waters where they nei∣ther ebb nor flow, yet truely there was no offence taken, they were received, and little regarded by us, having, as wee said, a transcript of them.
Some three weekes after, the said Minister ask∣ed one amongst us whether wee had looked into our papers he had returned to us? answer was made, no; he bad us look into our Treatise of pray∣er (wherein our endeavour and care was to be studiously curious) and there wee should see what his son had written. Wee did, as hee desired, and quickly found his sons handy work for some leaves together, as pleased him, or him that ap∣pointed him, false glosses, unjust constructions, the blackest lines did that young man draw-over ours in many places; and, at length, down-right blasphemy charged he upon us. Whereat we were startled a little at present, not because the son of that Minister charged us so deeply; for he was, as some say, very youthfull till of late, when the hands of the Presbytery were laid upon him;
 what change was wrought upon him at that time, or since that day, they should know, who live neere him, heare his Doctrines, and see his practise; But youthfull he was, as is said after the manner of young folk; and then as Paul said, all in him, or don by him was childish while he was a child: so happely in the next step of our life which is youth, he that is a youth thinks as a youth, speaks as a youth, acts as a youth, all in him, or don by him is youthfull, that is, subject to miscarriages and mistakes, therefore wee, as wee were saying, regarded little what the son said speaking of his own, nor can wee think it strange, that a youth should act like a youth (every age of our life ha∣ving something peculiar to its self.) But this we think strange, That the son charged our book so in the presence of his father, and where two learned and pious Divines, as is meete for us to judge, were present at the same time, whose names wee shall mention in the ensuing papers. You have heard our case, wee will detaine thee no longer, when wee have added this, That having offered our matters succeslesly to that Minister, returning them with such a—castigation (as the like, wee think, hath not been heard or read) though wee were charged by him to give him our perswasion,
 and the reason thereof, in reference to the matters aforesaid, we find our selves constrained to make our matters publick; which we doe the more cheer∣fully, being confident of this thing, That there is nothing here, or in that, which may follow after, which is against piety or charity; for wee had ra∣ther our bones should be scattered like chips about the hewing-place, than that our pen (which hath the advantage of the tongue, more hearers) should as others doe in this scribling age scatter errour and wickednesse among the people, as the Scorpi∣on its poyson.
Wee trust the Good Hand of Him (our onely leane-to, and that leads into all truth) so far, as that wee hope you shall find Truth all along, and mannaged in our measure, as becometh sons of truth, and fellow-helpers of the same; This Good Spirit direct your heart to the love of Christ, which onely is constraining to love Truth and peace; and to keepe both as thou keepest the apple of thine eye, or thy chiefest Treasure. Amen.
