May it please your Grace,
YOur Grace being so eminent a Minister of State in this Kingdom, the main Pillar of the Irish Church, under the Government, and so great an Example of Loyalty and Sted∣diness to the Crown, is the reason why this Pa∣per flies to your Protection, presuming your Grace will encourage the Principles of Loyalty in others; because they are so signal in your self.
It is the joy of all good men to see those, who were found faithful in the times of adver∣sity, plentifully rewarded; to see those Jewels appendant on the Crown, which formerly had shewed their true value by sparkling in the dark; and indeed who so fit to partake of the bles∣sings of Peace, which flow from the Fountain of Royal Bounty, as those who in the late times
 of Apostasie and Confusion, durst be Orthodox and Loyal, though it was reputed the worst of Crimes to be so? that which is a just Reward to your Grace, is an Encouragement to others to follow your great Example, and the same Beams that shine on your Grace, warm and enliven the Seeds of Loyalty in others.
Honor is not fit for a Malignant, nor does a Garland become the Brow of a Rebel: It is un∣reasonable they should expect Favours from His Majesty, who are disaffected to the Govern∣ment, and with what confidence do they expect to drink of a pure Stream, who cast Dirt and Mud into the Fountain; as if their grinning at the Higher Powers were a sufficient reason for the King to through Preferments into their Mouths.
The worst of your Graces Enemies cannot but acknowledge you to be Orthodox and Loyal: and what can your best Friends, or e∣ven the greatest Panegyrick say more? since to be a Christian, and a Subject, to fear God and honour the King, are the two great ends of e∣very mans nativity.
Your Graces experience of the late times will tell you, that a Sermon of this kind preach'd some years agoe, would have made the Preach∣er
 to be pull'd down, and given occasion to an Insolent Officer to enter the Pulpit with a Back-sword, and hold forth to the People in Buff. But God be thanked we now may preach Peace and Obedience to our Superiours, with∣out danger of Banishment, and may exhort Subjects to Loyalty, and Allegiance to their natural Prince, without fear of Imprisonment or Sequestration.
I do not pretend to any thing extraordinary in this Sermon: but the usefulness of Discour∣ses of Loyalty at this time, made some Persons of Worth and Sence perswade me to publish it. I submit my self to your Graces censure, and however mean the Piece be, I hope your Judgment will be favourable, because of the honesty of its design. We find that the Hea∣then Votaries offered to their Tutelar Gods, not only Irrational Creatures, as Birds and Beasts, but sometimes even those that were most ridiculous and despicable; and as we can∣not imagine any Rational Heathen to be so sot∣tish, as to perswade himself that such Sacrifices were pleasing to the Gods for their intrinsick value (unless he believ'd the Deities to be as stupid and senceless as the Brutes that were of∣fer'd to them) but because they were demon∣strations
 of the inward affections of the mind: so this I hope, though unworthy of so great a Patron, may find acceptance, for this reason only, because it is an argument of a profound acknowledgment of that Service & Duty which is due to your Grace, not only from me, but from all the Sons of the Church of Ireland.
I humbly beg your Graces pardon, for de∣taining you from a better employment of those few Minutes which free you from the weighty Affairs of Church and State. It would be an argument both of want of sence and good man∣ners in me, to trouble your Grace with a te∣dious Dedication of so inconsiderable a work, which yet humbly hopes to be accepted, be∣cause I have no other way of shewing my self to be,
