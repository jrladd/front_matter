MY LORD,
I Presume to address to your
Lordship, a Treatise a∣gainst
the Council of
Trent, that is, against a Conven∣ticle
of this last age, wherein the

ancient Faith was opprest by the
establishment of modern errors,
and Religion crusht by the inte∣rests
of a politic faction.
Besides the particular obliga∣tions
I have to offer to your
Lordship the best of my acknow∣ledgments,
I could not have made
a more suitable dedication of this
Book, then to a branch of that
Noble Family, which was ever
zealous for the Faith once deli∣ver'd
to the Saints; and to a Bi∣shop
of that Church, which has
alwaies declar'd it self against
the unhappy policy of that See,
which builds its own greatness
upon the ruines of the simplici∣ty
of the Gospel.

These two singular qualifica∣tions,
appear so eminently in the
conduct of all your Lordships af∣fairs,
that to them we are to at∣tribute
that extraordinary appli∣cation,
whereby you answer all
the ends of your high calling;
and content not your self with
the advantages and honor, but
descend to the most laborious
and difficult parts of so great a
charge: that diligent and strict
watch, whereby you do not on∣ly
preserve your own Flock, but
discover all the designs and ar∣tifices
of its enemies; that un∣blamable
conduct, which the
most violent and partial of your
dversaries cannot but admire:
that servent charity which di∣rects

to your Lordship as to a sure
refuge all them that desire to for∣sake
either vice or error: but above
all that evenness and steddiness of
mind, which aSt. Basil. Father of the
Church calls the Life and Soul
of Episcopacy, wherewith Almigh∣ty
God has endu'd your Lord∣ship
in so eminent a degree, that
it may be lookt upon as your pe∣culiar
Character.
My Lord, it would be a noble
subject to reflect upon a few late
instances you have given, that
you prefer your honor and con∣science
above all interests what∣ever;
that you have no concern
but for the welfare both of Church
and State; and tho the great∣ness
of your quality sufficiently

entitles you to the highest honor
that either of them can bestow;
yet you owe your advancement
purely to your own merit.
But My Lord, I am prevented
by the acclamations of the public
and the voice of the whole Na∣tion,
which by the great things
you have already don is making
judgment of the yet greater happi∣ness
it shall one day derive from
your Lordships future undertak∣ings.
This is become the employ∣ment
of persons more proportio∣ned
to such a work; and it is the
utmost of my ambition to be ad∣mitted
amongst the meanest of
them, who are daily beseeching
Almighty God, that he would still
prosper your Lordship in the

accomplishment of those noble
designs wherein you are happily
engag'd for the good both of
Church and State.

MY LORD,
