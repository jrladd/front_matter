My Lord,
SOme Philosophers tell us, That all the great and goodliest Natures dis∣play their Excellencies in three things, Light, Heat and Love. The more Light dances in Precious Stones, the more is their worth: Heat raises Eagles above Worms, and those Palms are held the Noblest, which have the most Love and Inclination to their Fellows. I need not tell the World how eminent those Qualities are in your Lordship, whose Ʋnderstanding daily assists the best Monarch and the best
 Church in the World, with its Lights and Counsels, whose vigour and activity of Spirit, mingled with the Nobleness of your Blood, has worthily advanced you to the best Of∣fice in the Church; and whose Candour and Bounty triumphs over so many Hearts.
But it is these Virtues, that make all us especially, who have the Happiness to live under your Lordships care, to study all pos∣sible ways to give testimony of that Ho∣nour and Duty we owe you. Among the rest I have put in my Mite, and with your Lordships leave, will hereafter endeavour to mend both the coyn and the summ. I would not fill your Lordships left hand with a Letter, and therefore humbly beg∣ging your Blessing, I rest,
Right Honourable and Right Reverend Lord,
Leigh, Nov. 21. 1682.
