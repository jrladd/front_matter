Right Humble,
THe mighty Nazarites Riddle, Out of the Eater came Meat, and out of the Strong came Sweetness, Judg. 14.14. was the second Course served in at his Marriage-Feast; which by way of Al∣lusion may not unaptly be applied to you: Came not the Spirit of God upon you at the Conquest of that de∣vouring Lyon, in the fierce Assaults of his ingenious Temptations? At your return from which Spiritual Combat, began you not to feed on the Peace of Good Consciences, when the Word of the Lord became as Honey in your mouthes? Is not this a Riddle to the Ʋncircumcised of the World?
In Congratulation of which no common Victory, is this Address no less properly then humbly prostrated to you onely, as the most faithful Guardians of this Holy Arbor; whose unfenced Ambulage, when spiced at your approach by the fragrancy of your Innocency, craves the Subterfuge of your Prayers.
As for those extravagant Weeds which grow so far beside the Alley of your Conversation, they are left to
the Euroclydons of the Air: But for the Errata's onely of the Artist, they may fall within the ambit of your Charity, to dictionate according to the Rule thereof.
The Civil man, that looking through the crevice of Morality, spies Religion afar off, will doubtless pre∣tend a Right to many precious Flowers in this Arbor, as legally descended to him from his Pharisaick Pa∣rents, under a Title of much supercilious Sanctity, and no little Righteousness; whilest the pestilent air of sulphur'd-mouthed Prophaners, enhazard the fairest leaves of withering into waste paper: But since neither the Ʋsurping Hypocrisie of the one, nor the Malicious Satanity of the other, was ever yet Prayer-proof; Be it your delight to engage your interest with Heaven; Be it your Spirits holy Rapture, to wrestle with the Angel of the Covenant: Mount Elisha's Chariot, and travel a Prayers journey for a Flaming Sword.
