MY LORD,
WHAT my Worthy Friend did,
when he publish'd one of my
precedent Histories, I beg leave
now to do my self, and to make use of the
Opportunity which my Presence in England
at this time affords me, to present these Sheets
to YOUR GRACE. The End my Friend
had in that Dedication, was to procure me
the Protection of YOUR GRACE, to
whom it was then my Misfortune to be un∣known:
But now I am so sensible of YOUR

GRACE's unmerited Favours, that this small
Offering proceeds from Gratitude; tho' com∣mon
Prudence were enough to have induc'd
me to shelter this Work under the Patronage
of a Name known and valued by all Europe;
a Name worthily born by YOUR GRACE,
the deserved Heir of a Race of Heroes. That
Great and Warlike Spirit, which YOUR
GRACE inherits from a long Descent of Re∣nown'd
Ancestors, takes You from that soft
Rest and Ease You might enjoy at home,
and carries You abroad into the Field of
Fame and Glory, there to hazard both Life
and Fortune; the one for the Safety, the
other for the Honour and Reputation of
England: And 'tis That attracts the Hearts
of all Nations, even of our Enemies, and
inclines them to love, admire, and re∣spect
You; witness what we saw in that
Great Day of Landen, wherein Your Hero∣ick
Courage vanquish'd our Victorious Ene∣mies,
even then when you fell into their
Hands, dy'd in Your Noble Blood. Your
Valour amaz'd them, but Your Civil Generous
Deportment charm'd them, and has made the
Celebrated Name of ORMOND Reverenc'd

and Esteem'd among all the High Officers of
the Armies of France; if I may not say
Fear'd, without disrespect to a Brave and
Valiant Enemy. They are great Judges of
Martial Worth and Merit; and therefore, at
the same time that they applaud and admire
it in YOUR GRACE, they cannot but be
apprehenive of it in an Enemy; especially
when they consider it lodg'd in One born
to Command, and whom the Greatest
Monarch and General now in the World
has tutor'd through all the Steps and Degrees
of Experience, before he made him Lieutenant-General
of his Armies; tho' it were a Commis∣sion
antecedently due to so Illustrious a Person.
His Majesty would have YOUR GRACE to
be the chief Sharer with him in all the Toils
and Dangers, to which he has so undauntedly
expos'd himself for the Common Good of the
Cause he heads: 'Twas You He would have
daily with him in the Trenches during the
most Famous and Important Siege of Namur,
to give YOUR GRACE all the Ad∣vantages
of the Best and the most Per∣fect
Knowledge in the several Arts of War,
that He may one Day confide the Lea∣ding

of his Armies to the DUKE of
ORMOND.
But, MY LORD, I forget that I venture
upon an Attempt in which the ablest Pens
may miscarry. YOUR GRACE has been
so often regal'd with Epistles Dedicatory from
the most Ingenious Persons, who look upon
You as the great Patron of Mars and of the
Muses, that even at the best I can but make
an Eccho to their Endeavours, in setting forth
YOUR GRACE's due Praise. This Con∣sideration
bids me be silent, and only desire
leave to subscribe my self,
May it please YOUR GRACE,
