Sir,
THis smal Ser∣mon may well bee termed Zoar, for is it not a little one? Yet it bears good proportion to the short text; on which it discourseth;

little auditory for which it was compo∣sed, and your private Chappel wherin it was delivered. As it is smal, so it desired to be secret, and intended no appearance in pub∣like. Good was the counsel which Iaash gave Amaziah. 2 Cro. 25. 19. Abide now at home, especi∣ally in our dangerous dayes, when all go∣ing,

is censurable for gadding abroad with∣out a necessary voca∣tion.
But seeing such was your importunitie, to have it Printed, that all my excuses to the contrary, which I could alledge with truth, and the delays, which I could make with manners, might not prevaile: I have chosen rather to be ac∣counted

undiscreet then uncivil, and have yeelded to your desire. Surely Sir, Heaven can never return a de∣nial to your requests whom I presume, (by proportion of your ear∣nest desiring so smal a matter) to be zealous in your desires of hier concernment, that no∣thing but a grant can give you satisfaction.
But the mainest

motive, next your im∣portunity, which put me on this publike ad∣venture, was the con∣sideration of my en∣gagements to your no∣ble bounty, above my possibility of deserving it. The Apostle with it is part of the duty of a good servant, Tit. 2. v. 9. , not answering againe. I must confesse my selfe your Servant, and

therefore it ill besee∣med me to dislike or mutter against any thing you was pleased I should doe. Thus de∣siring the continuance and increase of all spi∣ritual and temporal happines on your ho∣nour. I commend you to the Almighty.
