DREAD SOVERAIGN,
SInce Providence hath been propitious to You, e∣ven to a miracle, and having dispell'd those grosse mists and mistakes which formerly Clou∣ded You, You now begin to Shine in Your proper Sphere, beyond the lustre of your most Illustrious Pre∣decessors; which hath drawn to You, not only the Addres∣ses, but the Admiration of all others; lest it should be a sin in me, whose heart and actions have ever been humble and loyal to Your Royal Father, If I did not, to testifie my gra∣titude, make early tender of such a poor Miners mite, to the recesses of Your acceptation and honour, as was first in∣tended by the Lord Chancellor Bacons Philosophical Theory to Eternize the memory of Your Royal Grand-Father in an Heroick and pious Act, without any other countenance of Your Power, or contribution of Your Purse, than a meer vertuous patronage of this providential work of Mineral discoveries, and concealed Treasures: Be pleased therefore, Royal Sir, when Your leisure serves, to cast Your favoura∣ble Eye upon a small part of the Cabalistick way of that in∣tended practice, here humbly presented by his menial Ser∣vant, to Your sacred Majesty; and if Your wisdome upon the perusal thereof shall approve of the same, as Your two im∣mediate Predecessors, of ever blessed memory have done, I doubt not at all, by Gods blessing, But I shall be instru∣mental
 in rendring You the greatest Prince on earth by my prosecution of my Lords Philosophical design aforesaid. And as my Lord directed me, to have no Partner, so my humble sute, to Your Majesty, is, That no Person whatsoever should share with You in the glory of this Philosophical design, or frustrate the successe thereof by their self-respects, as King Henry the 7th. lost the benefit of the West-Indies by fol∣lowing the counsel of such as obstructed his pursuing of that great affair, which this Nation hath ever repented in vain. But fearing the multiplicity of Your more urgent occasions might not give Your Majesty time to read the whole Narra∣tive of all proceedings in that abridgment; Therefore I have thus Epitomiz'd the Way; to which I have annexed my Lords chief Ends therein, propounded by one of the Fathers of his Solomons House, under a continued Prosopopeia, and I have discovered withall in the cloze, what hath hi∣therto obstructed my happy progresse in the same; all which that your sacred Majesty would be pleased to peruse, is the only boon that he humbly craves, who hath no other ambiti∣on, but to subscribe himself, as he is in duty bound,
