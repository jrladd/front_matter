ALthough my very good Lord, neither according to my ho∣nest desire, nor your
honorable desert (wch worthily may chal∣lenge from me a farre more dutifull service than my attendance upon you into Flan∣drs) I could not in person, as I did in good will, be present in the same Journey (where I both might have reaped profit, and your Lordship been fully ascertained of my good mind towards you, for that I protest
unto you remaining in this out-nook of the little world (where London newes is some∣what scant, and the Princes affaires very seldome known) I had no intelligence of your so honourable place of Embassie in this year of Christ 1578. untill two daies after your departure. The which bred some corsey of a Melancho∣ly conceipt in me, by
reason of my foolish negligence that would no oftner direct my Letters to crave intel∣ligence from London. And by reason of the unkind forgetfulnes of my kindred & friends remaining there, who would not vouchsafe so much courtesie in a matter so much desi∣red by me, and of so small a trouble to them, as to direct their Letters to me thereof.
Wherefore sorrowing for that which is past, that I could not as the rest of my kindred, & friends did, assume such enterprize upon me, and yet not only rejoycing at your ho∣nourable entertain∣ment, of the good suc∣cess, of the wise Dis∣patch, and of the or∣derly behaviour, wher∣with your Lordship was received beyond the Seas; but also de∣sirous
by pen amongst the rest of your wel∣willers at this your happy and desired re∣turn to congratulate your Lordship with the tokens of my old yowed fidelitie, as a sign of my hidden joy conceived of your safe arrival, I have thought it my challenged duty to direct this tedious Discourse unto you, containing aswell the unfolding of my for∣mer
griefs, As laying open to your sight the rejoycing of my well∣willing heart. And for that other occasion doth not so fitly mini∣ster cause to me in o∣ther sort to present my self unto you than by saying somewhat wch may, & doth concerne Embassadours; There∣fore as wel for that the time is most apt for the man to whom I write, having supplied
such place, & for that it also putteth me in mind of your honou∣rable courteous talk which you have often used unto me in like matters, I will here in affaires of Embassie to an Ambassadour pre∣sent my labours, the Ambassadours of their absent Master, & make discourse of things belonging to Embas∣sie. Wherein I will shew the original, Pri∣vileges,
the Wisdom, the Valour, the quick wits, & other the be∣haviours of Ambassa∣dours, as examples for us in all respects to im∣mitate: For as Seneca saith in his sixth Epi∣stle, Longum iter est per praecepta, breve & efficax per exemplum, of which kind of people, that is of Ambassadours, Le∣gats, or Deputies, Mes∣sengers of Princes, and of the Orators of Kings (For all these severall
termes do include one Function exercised in divers manners) be∣cause there are sundry sorts somewhat diffe∣rent from the custome of our age, I will not only intreat as they were in times past a∣mongst the magnifi∣cent Romans in the middest of their grea∣test glory; But I wil al∣so in like order collect, and digest the usage and duty of them as they are now used, &
put in office by Prin∣ces, Kings, and Empe∣rors, for the executing of their determined pleasure. In which (my good Lord) if any thing shall be found, that for want of more diligent search may seem faulty, consider that Bernardus non vi∣det omnia. Wee are no Gods, wee can say no more than reasonable conjecture or former Authority may lead us unto. But if in the pla∣cing
of the same in the apt sentences, or in the sweet composition of stile there appear de∣fault, impute the same to the want of leisure, and to the rude hasty writing of him, who was never brought up in any Vniversitie, and I seek not fueum verbo∣rum, so I may have ip∣sam veritatem, & mate∣riam solidam. And thus, this far of that; And so into my purposed matter.
