SIR,
BEing sensible how
prevalent the Cen∣sures
of Envy and
ill Nature are al∣most
over every
thing that once becomes pub∣lique,
I thought it my pru∣dent'st
Course before hand to
provide my self such a shelter,
as might, if not wholly keep off

the effects of their Malice, at
least render them little preju∣dicial
to me.
Immediately therefore I was
carried away by a force of Na∣ture
impossible to be resisted,
to beg leave that I might have
your Protection for my San∣ctuary,
being very well assu∣red
your Name is Amulet
enough against all the despite∣ful
outrages of perverse dispo∣sitions.
And indeed to whom could
I with more reason Dedicate a
Book composed by that Fa∣mous
Philosopher Mr. Anthony
Le Grand, and consequently of
a most Elevated dignity, then

to your self, who not only most
delights in the vertues of it, but
at large possesses them.
Persons of your Quality,
Sir, can very seldome fix their
vertue, and make it regular;
the impetuous tumults of a gid∣dy
world are so violent upon
their sences, that they are
quickly Hurrican'd out of
course by them: but the De∣bauches
of an Impious and de∣generate
Age have no inluence
upon your steddy mind; You
injoy an undisturbed compo∣sure,
notwithstanding all the
Attacques of others to divert
the Channel, and are not like
those bodies, whose Complexi∣ons

follow the nature of their
Climates; for you live in the
continual exercise of vertuous
Actions, amidst those who
make it the chiefest of their
practise to stifle and oppress
them.
As Heaven has been very
prodigal of its bounties to You,
it has likewise instructed You
how to injoy them; and You
do it in so noble, generous, and
exalted a manner, that all
Mankind who have heard of
Your fame, are forced to ac∣knowledge
You best deserve
them: and instead of envying
your affluence, they have more
reason to wish that You may

dayly meet with new Accessi∣ons.
Your Greatness has not the
power to make You supercili∣ously
haughty; you receive all
addresses with such a familiarity
and easiness of Nature, that
plainly shews 'tis Vertue only
magnifies you: and the quali∣ties
you have made natural to
you are so excelling, that as evil
men can find nothing in them
to maligne, so good men cannot
see any thing but what they ad∣mire
and doate upon.
Let me then in all humility
implore your Patronage of
what is so much your own:
ther's none will doubt the va∣lue

of any thing which shall
have the happiness of pleasing
You: and in it I shall not only
have my greatest security, but
shall find also my extreamest
Obligations to be all my life,
SIR,
