Right Honourable,
I Have for many yeeres together professed my selfe a Souldier, and have been admitted by power flowing from your spring to act in command against the common Enemy, during these distracted times, which nothing more; desire then so to continue as farre as shall stand good with Gods Divine providence, and this causes continuance; therefore must crave leave to speake in such language as affectionate duty
can best expresse it selfe by tongue: I confesse when I meditate upon the height of your noble spirits, and withall the flatnesse of my poore abilities; as I present this in love; so with much feare, as having medled with the publishing of such a Subject so unconcerning my own quality, although imboldned by di∣vers friends to Publish this which I have kept secret for many yeeres together; but now at last reflecting upon the overture of things in these distracted times, am imboldened under your Honours favour to conceive the publish∣ing of such a subject may conduce to the pro∣fitting of the Common-wealth. I am confi∣dent the Ancient establishment of the Crown Revenue Charge of this Kingdome of Eng∣land, is not unknowne to most of your Ho∣nours in all the particulars; yet long time, and the face of war having ruined, distracted and desolated many of those Ancient particular establishments; few of them remaining with∣in their bounds without some abuse; which by your great wisedomes, and pious care is now like to be re-established in all the parti∣culars,
as cannot in the first place but conduce to the good of the republike, and secondly to the good of all those who are or may be intressed herein; this then cannot hinder, but rather give light to so honourable a worke: I am for the Souldier, not for the Rhetorici∣an, therefore left my endevours convert into a vapour, ere they can reach the height of your merits: I humbly crave your Honours to cherish them, desiring Almighty God to give your Honours a happy Issue in all your high concernments; so that you may attaine to that peace so much wished for by your Ho∣nours, and prayed for by him that is your de∣voted Souldier, now bound for the service in Ireland, to the losse of the uttermost drop of his blood to serve you,
