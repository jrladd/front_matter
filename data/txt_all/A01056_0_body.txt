THE Title of this little worke (may good Cozen) is in sence but the argument of a Dedi∣cation; which being in most writers a Custome, in many a complement, I question not but your cleere knowledg of my intents, will in me read as the earnest of affection. My am∣bition herein aimes at a faire flight, borne vp on the double wings of gratitude, for a receiued, and acknow∣ledgement for a continued loue. It is not so frequent to number many kinsmen, & amongst them some friends; as to presume on some friends, and amongst them little friendship. But in euery fulnesse of these particulars, I doe not more partake through you (my Cozen) the de∣light, then enioy the benefit of them. This Inscription to your name, is onely a faithfull deliuerance to Memory of the truth of my respects to vertue, and to the equall

in honour with vertue, Desert. The contempt throwne on studies of this kinde, by such as dote on their owne sin∣gularity, hath almost so out-fac'd Inuention, and pre∣scrib'd Iudgement; that it is more safe, more wise, to be suspectedly silent, then modestly confident of opinion, here∣in. Let me be bold to tell the seuerity of censurers, how willingly I neglect their practise, so long as I digresse from no becomming thankfulnesse. Accept then (my Cozen) this witnesse to Posteritie of my constancy to your Merits, for no Ties of blood, no ingagements of Friendship shall more justly liue a President, then the sin∣cerity of Both in the Heart of
IOHN FORD.
