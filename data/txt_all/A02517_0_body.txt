RIGHT HONORABLE,
LEt it please you to re∣ceiue from the Presse what you vouchsafed to require from my pen: Vnworthy I confesse either of the publike light, or the beames of your

Honours iudicious eies; yet such as (besides the motiue of common im∣portunity) I easily apprehended might be not a little vs full for the times; which, if euer, require quickning: Neither is it to no purpose that the world should see in what stile wee speake to the Court, not without ac∣ceptation. This, and what euer ser∣uice I may be capable of, are iustly de∣uoted to your Lordship, whom all good hearts follow with true Honour, as the great Patron of learning, the sincere friend of Religion, and rich purchaser of Truth. The God of Hea∣uen adde to the number of such Peeres, and to the measure of your Lo: graces and happinesse.
