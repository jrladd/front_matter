MY LORD,
I Have received many encouragements (by Friends that have per∣used these Collections) to render them to the publicke, which cannot bee done without

your Lordships approbation and permission to the Presse. The Catalogues of the great officers in France (long since printed) have offorded much contentment and do worthily preserve the memory of such as merited in those places and their qualities. And as I have no other but the same end in the publishing of these. So I will com∣fort my selfe with an humble hope that it will give no discontentment. The incouragements your Lord∣ship hath conferred up on the office of Armes in generall & my selfe in particular with a bountifull hand may give your Lordship just occa∣sion to expect some fruite of our in∣deavours: If these may passe in that estimate, but for blossomes it will

be more then they demerite. And if your Lordship shall conceive them worthy to bee communicated to the world, I most humbly crave leave that they may passe under Dedication to your Lordship, which grace and favour will give them life and acceptation, and very much incourage and comfort
