WHat the Jews once said of their
Centurion, He loved our Na∣tion,
and built us a Syna∣gogue,
the same may we affirm
upon a more Noble Accompt of
Your Lordship, and of those faithful Centurions
and Soldiers under Your Conduct; by how much
the Adventure of your Lives in the Cause of
God, for the Good of your Country, is a more in∣fallible
Demonstration of your Love to it: for∣asmuch
as the King of Saints, is also King of
Nations, and when he shall be the desire of
all Nations, will prove their safest Interest.

Ʋpon consideration whereof, it was but equal
that Mr. Eliot a faithful Laborer of Christ in
spreading the Everlasting Gospel to the Poor
Indians, should prefix Your Lordships Name
to his Relation of the Progress of Divine Grace
amongst them: And with his Judgment, We of
the Corporation, who are subordinately intru∣sted,
do so far concur, especially moved there∣unto
by that liberal and Exemplary Contributi∣on
to this Glorious Work lately promoted by Your
Lordship, and Your Officers with the Army,
that we thought not fit either to sever that
Narrative, and this of Mr. Mayhew's, or
to send them abroad under any other Name to
the Publick View.
