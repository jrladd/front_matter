Right Worshipfull,
MAY it please you to take into your hand, that, which not long since you receyved into your eare, with undeserved attention and favourable censure: (the which only, next your
 private favours, encouraged mee to fixe your Name.) And to let it shrowde under your Protection, which otherwise would bee loath to walke at all abroad. It desires to baulke the common eye, as too un∣worthy an object; onely content to visit private friends: some, I pre∣sume it may find; your Name may make it many: your selfe is instar omnium. If you please to accept it, as first or chiefe, it shall embolden the Authour to subscribe himselfe
