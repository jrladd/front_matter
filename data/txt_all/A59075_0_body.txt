MY LORD,
THE Times obvious discourse, whereby
that All which truly loves Nobless or
Learning congratulates your highly
deserved Honor, caused me collect
these, taken out of no obvious Monu∣ments,
touching the auncientest mention, conjuncti∣on,
and division of those two Great Offices of State
which your Lordship really bears, though stiled
but by the name of one: they are short, yet give large
testimony of the former times. They conclude with
an Act made about 320. years since, of like tenor in
substance with that later under Queen Eliz. which
was as proper to your name, whence these also were
the fitter to offer you: Enough, other particulars
touching both these Great Offices might have been
added, but these were chosen for the usual Question
of the present, and thus are given (not yet seen by
any other eye) as a taste of my humble Observance.
My Lord, they are only yours, as their Author
would be,
