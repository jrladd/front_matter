LOe here (renowned Gentlemen) I bring
The due acknowledgements, the Muses sing
In liuely, and perpetuall memory
Of him, who, though the Fates ordain'd to dye,
Hath left vntainted Honour, free from staine
To his posterity; then great's your gaine,
Faire your enioyments, and your haps are good,
That haue your veynes fil'd with so Noble blood;
So are his vertues in your hearts combin'd,
The rich endowments of his blessed mind;
Be also like him, in this very thing,
Be courteous, to accept this offering.
