My Lord:
THe long experience, I have had of your Honours favourable in∣tentions towards me, hath com∣pell'd me to this Presumption. But I hope your Goodnesse will be pleased to pardon what your Benignity was the cause of, viz. the errour of my Dedication. Had your Candor not encourag'd me, in this I had beene innocent: Yet (I beseech you) thinke not, I intend it any other, then your Recreation at your retirement from your

weighty Employments; and to be the De∣claration of your gracious encouragements to∣wards me, and the testimony of my Gra∣titude. If the publicke view of the world en∣tertayn it with no lesse welcome, then that private one of the Stage already has given it, I shall be glad the World owes you the Thankes: If it meet with too severe Con∣struction, I hope your Protection. What hazards soever it shall justle with, my de∣sires are it may pleasure your Lordship in the perusall, which is the only ambition he is conscious of, who is
My Lord,
