Gentlemen,
IN a Word, You are England's Ephori,
and Tribuni; The Boundaries of
Prerogative and Priviledge, and the
living Bulwark of the Laws. Your Honour
is Eclipsed, is unaccoun∣tablyLearned Dr. Cowel, in word Jury, speaks of Ju∣ries being (in his own words) Associates and Assistants to the Judges of the Court (ancient∣ly) in a kind of Equa∣lity; whereas, now adays (saith he) they attend them in great Humility, &c Citing also Lamb. and Cust. of Normandy agreeing with them. shrunk: The Of∣fice
yet is great: Here's
demonstrated the great
Priviledge you be, that
it may be seen how much
all English-men ought,
in Interest, to Value and
Encourage you. Here's
set forth What and
How you may do, and
What and How you may not Do, un∣der

what Penalties: Also the History of
the Whole. The King is graciously pleased
to Declare, He will Govern by Law;
Is't fit you should know how to Govern
your selves according to Law. This is Con∣cise,
and a Breviate, rather than a Book,
that, should it meet with a queasie Stomach,
little Purse, or narrow Soul, the same
might not stumble at it. If any thing by
this means happen so general, as admit of
any Exception, you may expect it in some
other, if not in the same place. It's chiefly
about Criminal Causes, where the King's
Name's used for that of the Plaintiff, be∣cause,
most Difficult and Greatest Con∣cern;
But is serviceable and sufficient for
others too. It may, at least, serve to
Stir up, and to Foil, if not Assist learneder
Hands. Adieu.
