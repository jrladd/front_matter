TWo questions in demurer seeme to stay vs,
Which is the elder? and from whence ye came,
Not all the learning in old  Caius,
Was euer able to resolue the same:
Your Bookes and studies are the same and one,
The blessing from your Creditor must come.


Yare both as deepely learned (we doe know it,)
As to the very center of the celler:
For Kitchen Physicke, if ye list to shew it,
Y-haue stomacks that can far out doe Mountpellier,
And for the rest of all the Sciences,
We may send Doway bold defiances.



Y'are both so ancient, worthy, so alike,
It were great pitty that you should contest,
But rather let your wits best powers vnite,
Against your equall enemy profest:
To multiply your Partizans apace,
The Temple Gods vouchsafe and giue yee grace.
