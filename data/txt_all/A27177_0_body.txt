MY LORD,
THere is none among all the Names of Honour, that hath more encouraged the Legitimate Muses of this latter Age, then that which is owing to your Familie; whose Coronet shines bright with the native luster of its owne Jewels, which with the accesse of some Beames of Sydney, twisted with their Flame presents a Constellation, from whose Influence all good may be still expected upon Witt and Learning.
At this Truth we rejoyce, but yet aloofe, and in our owne valley, for we dare not approach with any capacity in our selves to apply your Smile, since wee have only preserved as Trustees to the Ashes of the Authors, what wee exhibit to your Honour, it being no more our owne, then those Imperiall Crownes and Garlands were the Souldiers, who were honourably designed for their Convey∣ance before the Triumpher to the Capitol.
But directed by the example of some, who once steered in our qualitie, and so fortunately aspired to choose your Honour, joyned with your (now glorified) Brother, Patrons to the flowing compositions of the then expired sweet Swan of Avon SHAKESPEARE; and since, more particularly bound to your Lordships
 most constant and diffusive Goodnesse, from which, wee did for many calme yeares derive a subsistence to our selves, and Protection to the Scene (now withe∣red, and condemn'd, as we feare, to a long Winter and sterilitie) we have presumed to offer to your Selfe, what before was never printed of these Authours.
Had they beene lesse then all the Treasure we had contracted in the whole Age of Poesie (some few Poems of their owne excepted, which already published, com∣mand their entertainement, with all lovers of Art and Language) or were they not, the most justly admir'd, and belov'd Pieces of Witt and the World, wee should have taught our selves a lesse Ambition.
Be pleased to accept this humble tender of our duties, and till wee faile in our obedience to all your Commands, vouchsafe, we may be knowne by the Cogni∣zance and Character of
MY LORD,
