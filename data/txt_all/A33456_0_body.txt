SIR,
VNder your able Pa∣tronage I have pre∣sumed to shelter this my weak endeavor, which if for no other reason than the wel-meaning devotion ther∣of, I was sure would not be unacceptable or trouble∣some
 to you. Be pleased therefore to intermit awhile those Seraphical Raptures, in the excellency whereof, and your thereto tuned Pie∣ty, you are so famously happy. And vouchsafe an eare to the mean addresse of these Rudiments (as it were) of Church Musick, which, like other perfections, hath suffer'd meerly through the peoples ignorance.
To you therefore more e∣specially doe I dedicate this Essay, whose alone compe∣ent Skill and judgement
 in the highest mysteries of this Divine Science, if it shall please you to descend and deign a favourable ap∣probation thereunto, cannot but cōmand reception from others: since my knowledge at Oxford (improved fur∣ther at London) of your E∣minency this way, cannot so far disoblige the world as not to believe you have the su∣preme Mastery in religi∣ous Musick; by which, as you charm the Soul, and all its affections, no doubt you can prevail upon and per∣swade
 publick acceptance.
I submit this piece in this (howsoever rude) manner to your judgement, having attempted, I hope, something of tendency to the Churches peace and harmony, where∣of though I am a small and an unworthy Member, yet a Mite even from such is just∣ly exspected: For higher works God hath fitted and prepared your most Artfull Hand, and hath placed you in an Orb from whence your Melody (as of the Spheres) of holiness and constant good∣ness
 in and for the Church, is universally heard with joy and delight. In which hap∣piness, God Almighty long continue you here and late translate you to the Angeli∣cal Choire: so prayes,
Reverend Sir,
