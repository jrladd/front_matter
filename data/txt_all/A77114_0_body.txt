SIR,
DƲring the late Whirle∣winde in Church and State (in which, He that could not hold his tongue, could not hold his peace) I studied to Comment practically upon that Text of the Prophet;
Am. 5.13. The prudent shall keep silence in that time, for it is
an evill time. Privacy was then a priviledge, nothing so safe as soli∣tude, and I could not but hug my self, and applaud my condition, in obscu∣rity. No tyes of Interest, no flatteries of the Times could draw me out of my recesses, or court me to make a step on that publique Theatre, where I per∣ceived little acted, but what would put ingenuity to the blush, and make honesty ashamed: But now that by the goodnesse of God, the clouds are scattered, our day cleares up, and we seeme to sit under the smiles of Hea∣ven, I have adventured abroad under the Conduct of your name, to salute our new-borne Peace, and bid that desirable Stranger welcome into our more then wearied world, and this I have done in the great Congregati∣on. Nor have I done yet, but that
you may see how my obedience strives to be as large as your Commands, I have followed them from the Pulpit to the Presse. And though I thought these worthlesse conceptions publique enough before, as having delivered them in the face of the Country: yet since your selfe and others, neither the least, nor least considerable and intelligent part of the Auditory, are pleased to thinke otherwise, I submit what ever I thinke my selfe. They are now no longer mine, but yours, the Dedication makes them so, designe them your protection, they begg it, they need it. I heard some whisper∣ings, as if I were too tart, I value it not, errour must needs be the sore, where truth makes the smart. I shall not so much as Epistle the Reader to be courteous, the candid and cleare
brow'd will be so, as for the tetricall and angry generation, let them go;
Rumpatur, si quis rumpitur, invidia.
I am Sir
