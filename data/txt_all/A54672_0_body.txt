My Lord,
YOur Experience and practical Ob∣servation being the best Comment on those Annals and Registers which have an Aspect on this ensuing Treatise; Give me leave to offer it up to be Scann'd and Winnowed by your particular scrutinie; and if it shall receive its Appro∣bation in your Vogue and

Estimate, I fear no Blot from the Common Suffrage. For I shall not Fear that Ju∣stice, which is so even and Im∣partial; nor despair to find an Absolution there where the former is mixt and compli∣cated with so much Charity and Candor. And I dare with much Confidence expect to be Assoil'd by the Publique Decision, if once it shall ap∣pear that Your Private De∣termination hath discharged and acquitted
(My Lord)
