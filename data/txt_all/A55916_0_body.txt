MADAM,
THO such was the modesty of the Author, and so mean the Opinion which he had of all his own Performances, as would not suffer him consent to the Publication of this Discourse. Yet e great Usefulness of the Subject, and the extraor∣nary Virtue and Piety of the Person herein described, hose example may influence others to an imitation of  Goodness and Perfections. The consideration I say,  these things, has at length prevailed with those, to ose disposal this Discourse was committed, to send it rth into the World, tho in a plain and unartificial ress.
I must beg your Pardon, Madam, if hereby I con∣ibute any thing to the renewing of your Ladyships ief, for the loss of so excellent a Daughter, whom,
tho I never had the honour to know, yet I have hea my dear Friend Mr. Pritchard, speak so often  so great Things of her, that (considering his si∣cerity and great aversion to Flattery,) I am confide the Character here given of her, is true. I shall  presume to make any addition to it, tho perhaps it mig be said, that she as far exceeded the Character,  others fall short of it.
All that I shall further add, is to let the World kno how much they are obliged to your Ladyship, who  your own good Example, and wise Instructions, and car∣ful Education of your Daughter, in the ways of Religi and Virtue, has furnish'd them with so excellent a P∣tern, so worthy of their Imitation; may they all follow here, and be happy hereafter.
I am,
MADAM,
