LORDS. KNIGHTS. BVRGESSES.
TO you who are the re-presentiue body of England, and the Ep∣tomie and Compendium of this great Volume of our Estate; To you who are assummoned by our King, and sent vp by our Country, to obay the first with your best Fidelities, to serue the second with your chiefest Zeale and endeuours, and to affect and honour both, with your most religious Prayers and wishes. To you from whom God for his glory, our Soueraigne for his honour and safety, and our Church and Common-weale for their flourishing well-fare and prosperity, doe expect much by your transcendent and honourable imployments: To you I say, and to no other, doe I present this Consultation (termed VOX Coeli) to your consideration, and dedicate it to your protection.
And because (in point of integrite and duty) I hold my selfe bound o bring the truth neerer to your knowledge, or rather home to your

vnderstanding; May it please you to be informed, that about some three yeares since, at the first sitting of the last high Court of Parliament, when our King was so earnest in proposing the match of our Noble Prince his Sonne, with the Infanta of Spaine; When the King of Spaine cou∣lourably presented (though not really intended) to be depely affected to entertaine and embrace the said motion; When Coun Gondmar (his Ambassador) made shew to be a zealous solicitour, and a most actiue and officious stickler for compassing and finishing it; When our Romish Catholiques became passionately, and insultingly confident of the free tolleralon of their Religion, and in the skie-reaching mountaines of their ambitions and superstitious hopes, were already preparing to erect their Groues and Altars, to set vp their Idols and Images, and consequently to introduce their Pope and his Masse in the Temples of our God; when all Prisons were vnlocked and open to all pernitious Priests and dange∣rous esuites, and that many others  (Caterpillers and Vipers) came flocking and swarming from diuers parts of Europe, to poison and eate cut the soules of our people, with their Idolatrous doctrine of Antichrist, and to with-draw their hearts and consciences from their Alleagiance and Fideliie, to their naturall Prince and Countrey, purposely (with  treachery then Religion) to subiect them to a forraigne power and iurisdiction. When the Emperour had beaten the King of Bohemia from Prague, and the Duke of Bauaria with the assistance of the Swords, Soulders, and Treasure of the King of Spaine, had in a setled truce as∣saulted and taken many Townes in the Palatinate, contrary to their pro∣mises to our King, and of his Maresties to the Prince his Sonne in Law, and contrary to the Publique peace of Germany aend Christendome. Then, then it was, (that to pull off the Maske of Spaines ambition and ma∣lice, who with the fire of this match sought to set England all flaming in a mournfull and miserable combustion) thereby to bury her glory in the dust, and her safety in the cinders of her subuersion and ruines) that as Prometheus fetch'd fire from heauen, so the fire of my zeale to the good of my Prince and Country, likewise fetch'd from thence this Royall con∣sultation for the discouery of our apparant and imminent dangers, and in knowing them, to know likewise how to preuent them; Which re∣soluing to mke publiqe; because it solely reded to Englands pub∣lique  and prosperitie: I contrary to my expectation (but not to my feares,) saw my hope nip in their blossoms, and my desires stised in their births, because the Seas of our Kings affection to Spaine went so

loftle, and the winder were so tempestious, that it could not possibly be permitted to passe the Pikes of the Presse: When albeit my zeale and fi∣delity againe and again infused new audacitie and courage to my resolu∣tions, to see it receiue the light yet it was imposible for mee or it, to bee made so happy, because I sawe Allureds honest letter, Scots loyall Vox Populy, D. Whiting, D. Euerard, and Claytos zealous Sermons, and others, suppressed and silenced, as also Wards faithfull picture, which yet was so innocent, as it onely breathed foorth his fidelity to England in si∣lent Rethorique, and dumbe eloquence. Wherevpon inforced to take a lawe from the iniquitie of the time, (with much reluctation and more greife) I bushed vp my said Consultations in silence, & because I could not serue my Prince and Countrie in that Booke of mine: I therfore then renewed my constant resolution and zeale to serue them in my most seruent prayers, and my most religious and zealous wishes, the which I haue euer since faithfully and constantly performed.
Sitting thus to behold the constant inconstancie of the World, Which presents as many different accidents to our knowledge, as obiects to our eye; and being Iealous, Vigelant, and attentiue, to that which did, or which might any way appertaine to my Soueraigne and his Princely po∣steritie, to his Dominions and Subjects; I was enforced to see (O that I had beene so happie, as not to ban seene) the perfidious progresse of Spaines now trecheries, and vsurpation vpon many countries of Eu∣rope; for first his Cousen Leopaldus hath deuoured the Dutchy of Cleaues and Iulleirs: then he and his forces haue taken many other free Townes, and whole Bishoprickes in the Countries of Luxembourg, and L Marke, as also in the frontiers of Swisserland and Loraine; Then he and his factor the Duke of Bauaria (for him) hath finished his absolute Conquest of the Pallatinate (that dainty, rich and fertile Prouince of Germany) the dowry of our onely Princesse, the inheritance of the Prince her Husband, and the Patrimonie of their Royall issue, wherein the honour of our King, and his three famous Kingdomes, doe most ex∣treamely suffer.
I saw him conquer the chiefest Cities, Forts, and Passages of the Gri∣sous, and hath brought their liberties and liues to their last gaspe and periode; yea, to the mercilesse mercy of his not generous but bloody sword; which being vnder the protection of the French King. doth likewise cast a wonderfull staye and blemish on the lustre of his honour and Crowne, if he speedily take not his reuenge thereof; by leauing these his honest  as free as he found them, and as great Henry his

Father left them. And after the Triumphes and treacherous progres∣sion of the house of Austria in Germany. The King of Spaine hath now made a body of his, and the Imperiall forces, and this Summer intends to play his bloody prize for the totall ruine and subuertion of the Nether∣lands, who (to the eye if the world, and to humaine iudgement) must shortly sinke if the two Kings of great Brittaine and France doe not make them swim; by speedily sending them braue succours and assistance in this their vrgent necessity.
And wherevnto tends all this treacherous ambition, and formidable vsurpation and greatnes of the King of Spaine, but to cut out a passage with his sword, and to make his troopes & Regiments fly o're the Alpes, for his erecting and obtaining of the Westerne Empire: And wherevnto tends it I say, but to make his territories and Dominions to encirculiz great Brittaine and France, yea to be their Cloyster, and to make and esteeme those two famous Monarchies, but onely as a fatall Church-yard to burie and interre themselues in.
But Illustrious and generos Sirs, it this all the malice and treacherie which Spaine hath offered towards England; O no, nothing lesse, for vpon that Iournie (which was as dangerous as suddaine) of our Prince into Spaine (then whome the world hath not a brauer:) Hath not the King of Spaine dealt treacherously with him about his match with the Infants his Sister, yea haue they not in his Princely person, violeted the Lawes of Hospitality, and the priueledges of Princes (when being vn∣der his owne roofe) by attempting to tye him to formes, which were dia∣etrally opposite to his honour; yea, to be so audatiously impudent, as with much violency and virulency to seeke to put a rape vpon his Conscience, and Religion, and proffered inforcement of his Conuersion to Popery; as if their Infanta had bin to him more pretious then his soule, or that he had bin so wretchedly grounded and instructed in pietie, that his Highnesse would haue forsaken his God purposely to haue obayed & adored the King of Spaine, who is not, nor cannot be a greater King then he is a Prince.
And to step yet a degree further; was it not a hellish pollicy, and a diabolicall designe and resolution of the Counsell of Spaine, to aduise our Prince vpon his returne into England, to waerre vpon the Protestants, and to proffer him an Army to suppresse and exterminate them. The Pro∣tstants, I say, who are those by whome our King his Father raingeth, and without whom his Maiesty can neuer subsist nor raigne; nor his Highnesse sucessiely aspire, or hope to aspire to his Crownes and King∣domes

after him, sith they are the life, the vigour, the heart, and the soule thereof. And will our King, and our Prince, our Parliaments, and our Protestants of England, then euer forget this inueterate rage, and infernall malice of Spaine against them? as also the rest of their im∣perious and insulting cariage towards his Highnesse, and towards Great Brittaine, as if they priz'd i at so low a rate, and made their boundlesse ambition so excessinely ouer-valew their owne Spaine? that that were in the Crisis of her weakenesse and misery, and this in the prime and verti∣call point of her power and glory? And when his Highnesse pressed them for the restitution of the Pallatinate, which they had often promised to the King his Father, then they temporized so cunningly, and subtillized so trecherously with him, that euery day brought forth new delayes and dif∣ficulties, till in the end they had made the cure worse then the disease, and hauing taken firme footing therein, were enforced to vnuaile and vnmask their dissimulation, and faintly and coldly to affirme, that they would treat with the Emperour for the restitution thereof, but could not promise it: Thus hauing abused, first our King the Father, and then our Prince the Sonne, they haue now likewise betrayed and ruined our Princesse the Daughter in their finall Conquest, and resolute detention of the Prince her Husbands Palatinate, that Princesse I say, whose Royall and sublime vertues, make her the honour of her time, the ornament of her sexe, and the Phaenix Princesse of the world. Whereunto adding the absolute breach of the Match long since prophetically delacerated, and cast in Heauen by the Princely and Royall Authors of this Consultation, and since the same breach here on Earth likewise so happily confirmed by the King, as also by the Prince: so all these premisses considered, hath not En∣gland reason to hate Spaine, in regard Spaine hates it? especially be∣cause of these two maine ensuing points, and important considerations?
First, for that the King of Spaine is a greater, and more professed Enemy to our sacred King, and his Royall posteritie, then either the Em∣perour, or Duke of Bauaia, and is to be held and esteemed of vs.
Secondly, that therefore to denounce Warre to him, and to make it good as soone as it is denounced, is as Honourable as necessary, and as iust as honourable for England; As vpon New-yeares day last I made these two points apparant and manifest to the King; in my Discourse intituled Votiuae Angliae, which I sent his Maiestie in the behalfe and fauour of the Prince Palatine his Sonne in law, for the restoration of his Palatinate.
Hauing thus (with as much disdaine as griefe) seene his inueterate malice towards great Brittaine, towards our King and his Royall poste∣ritie, and consequently the eminent dauger whereinto our profound secu∣ritie hath throwne and precipitated vs in particular; and vnderstanding likewise how the said King of Spaine with Xerxes, threatens the Seas and Mountaines of Europe in generall; Being as well in heart as tongue an Englishman, and therefore knowing by Grace, what I owe by Nature to my Naturall Prince and Countrey (like Cressus his dumbe Sonne) I would not, I could not be silent thereat, but must expose this Consultation of Vox Coeli to the light and sight of the world: I meane to the light of your knowledge, and the sight of your considera∣tion, vnder the secure Target, and safe shelter and Sanctuary of your auspicious protection.
To you therefore great Brittaines greatest Palladines and Cham∣pions, to you the inuincible Bulwarke of our King and his Royall Proge∣ny, and the inexpugnable Cittadel and Acrocorinth of our Estate: To you I say the Conscript Fathers of our supreamest Senate; doth it in dutie present it selfe, and in humilitie prostrate it selfe; which when your first leasure hath curiously read, and your best zeale carefully and maturely considered: Then by all that true English bloud which strea∣meth in your heart and veynes, by all the loue whic your Countrie beares you, and by all the dutie and affection which reciprocally you owe to your Country: I both request and coniure you, To tell our King that it is no∣thing for his Maiestie to haue made a braue and generous Declaration of Warres against Spaine, except hee speedily second it with execution, without which it will proue a vaine Fantasma, and an abortiue Embrion: Tell him, that it were the last Acts of Augustus, which embellished his raigne, and that old Pericles made the greatnesse of his generositie and courage, to reuiue and flourish on his Tombe, when hee caused the Athenians to warre vpon the Pelloponessians: Tell him that Philo∣paemenus affirmeth, that Peace is the best time to meditate of warre. Tell him that to transport Warre into Spaine, is to auoide and preuent it in England, as Hannibal said to King Antiochus, that the only way to make warre against the Romanes, was to begin it in the heart and bo∣wels of the Dominions of Rome, and so to vanquish Italy by Italy. Tell him that Plutarch affirmes there is no action so royall or magnifi∣cent in a King, as to take Armes to assist and reuenge his Confede∣rates vniustly oppressed and ruined, much more his owne Royall children,

and that if the Palatinate be too farre, that Flanders and Brabant, are but the skirts and Suburbs to England. Tell him that Agesilaus said, that words are feminine, and deeds masculine, and that it is a great point of honour, discretion, and happines for a Prince, to giue the first blowe to his Enimies. Tell him that Spaniards hate vs; why then should we loue them? that we can beat them at our pleasures, why then should we feare them? Tell him that if it goe not well with Holland, it must needs goe ill with England; and that if wee doe not preuent their ruine, that wee cannot secure our owne danger. Tell him that in matters of warre, it is dangerous to make a stand, shamefull to retire, and glorious to aduance. Tell him that Philip of Spaine is of Pyrrhus his minde, who said, that hauing deuowred and conquered all Europe, he would end his dayes in ollity and pleasure in Macedonia. And therefore that it is time, yea high time to strike vp our Drums against him, aswell because our saftie, as our honour inuites vs to it.
And now turning from his Maiestie, to you the Illustrious and famous body of this great and famous Court of Parliament (whereof the King is the head) to you, I say, who are the creame and flower of his Subiects: O hold it no disparagement tha I tell you; that sith in all matters of Order, Policie and reformation, that delayes and protractions proue still dangerous, many times fatall: That you beware least as your Con∣sultations flie away with the time; That occasion and opertunitie flie not away with your Consultations, sith time must be taken by his forelocke, and then as Iulius Caesar saieth, we haue winde and tide with vs.
Thinke what a happines, what a glorie it is for England to haue wars with Spaine, sith Spaine in the Lethirgie of our peace, hath very neere vndermined our safetie, and subuerted our glory; And let vs dispell those charmes of securitie, wherein England hath beene too long lul'd and en∣chanted a sleepe: And if feare & pusillanimitie, yet offer to shut your eyes against our safetie, yet let our resolution and courage open them to the im∣minency of our danger; that our glory may surmount our shame, and our swords cut those tongues and pennes in pieces, which henceforth dare ei∣ther to speake of peace▪ or write of truce with Spaine.
No, no; to take the length of Spaines foote aright, we must doe it with our swords, not with our ecks, for the first will assuredly establish our safe∣ty, and the second infaliby ruines it. Wars, Wars, then ye (with cheere∣full hearts and ioyfull soules) let vs prepare our selues for Warrs: That our great Brittaine (the beautie of Europe as Europe is the glory of the

world) lie no longer exposed to the apparant danger, and merciles mer∣cy of this Castilian Rat, of this Crocodile of Italy, of this vulture of Germany, and af this woolfe of Ardena; but let vs all signaliz our fi∣delities to our Soueraigne by our courage, and immortaliz our zeale to our Country by our valour and resolutions herein: That we may all be of Alcibiades his opinion, that the bed of honour is the best death, that there is no better recompence of death then glory, nor no richer glory, then to dye for our Prince and Country.
And here I had imposed silence to my penne, and infused a period to this my Epistle, had not the dignitie of your places, the quality of your im∣ployments, the nature of the time, and the consideration that I am an Englishman, commaunded me to insert and annex these few lines, by the way either of a supplement, or a post-script.
Although I can adde nothing to your affection and care, for the good of our Country, yet giue me leaue (I beseech you) to substract this from mine owne fidelitie and zeale.

1 That you be carefull that your warres (both by sea and land) be plentifully stored with money, powder and shot, which indeed is the veignes and Arteries, the sinewes and soule of warre.
2 That you crye downe all gold and siluer Lace, and all silkes, Vel∣uets, and Taffities, and crie vp woole cloath, and blacke  and Corslets insteede thereof, that thereby England as a blacke and dismall cloud, may looke more martiall and terrible to our Enimies.
3 That our English Romanists may be taught either to loue, or to feare England.
4 That there be prouision made, and especiall care had to secure his Maiesties Coasts, Seas. and Subiect from the Ships of warre of Dun∣kerke and Ostend, by whome otherwise they will be extreamely indoma∣ged and infested.
5 That by some who'some Statute and Order, you cleanse the Citties and Countrie, the Streets and highwaies from all sort of Beggers, by pro∣uiding for their labour and reliefe, whereby many hundred thousand Christian soules will pray vnto God for his Maiesty, and to power downe his blessings vpon all your Designes and Labours, whereby without doubt our Warres will succeed and prosper the better.

I will no further vsurpe on your patience: But here (withdrawing the Curtaine of this Preface) inuite your eyes and thoughts to the sight and consideration of this consultation,
