SIR,
HAving observed so many Learned and worthy Persons, upon divers occasions, both in their Studies and Imployments, espe∣cially at the Assizes and Sessions of Peace, to make use of Mr. Wingate's Abridgment of the Statutes with good Approbation, I could not but think a little Pains might be well bestowed, in continuing the same Method, and adding to it the Statutes made in the time of His present Majesty, and inserting the same, especially such as are of publick
and daily use, under their proper Titles; and seeing how eminent a Place and Part You have had in the Passing the same, it seemed to Me not improper, by this Address under Your Name, to advertise such others also, as may have occasion to make use of this Book; That although for the most part You may find the Statutes, at the least those of frequent use, so fully abridged, that I hope You will not have often occasion, to trouble Your Self with the Books at large, or to seek for such as be dispersed: Yet being but an Abridgment, continued of the late Acts, as of the other, when You shall doubt or find any thing obscure, the unavoidable accident of Brevity, You would not rely on it, but have recourse to the Statutes at large; some of which, to avoid the increasing of the Book to too great a bulk, especially such as be but upon continuance, I have onely pointed at and referred to: And as to the late Acts passed at Oxford, being after the Book was almost finished in the Press, they are added by way of Appendix: And such Statutes
as more particularly concern the Justices of the Peace, and Penal Laws, are marked with a Hand or Star.
And for the Table being Mr. Wingate's own, I was unwilling to alter the Frame, but rather supply it with the Additional Heads and Titles; which though at first, it may seem somewhat general, yet by diligent obser∣vation, the Method and References, to par∣ticular Clauses under the several Heads, I hope it will answer the use and ease to the Peruser intended: Which is the Aim and Desire of
SIR,
