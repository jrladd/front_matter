MY Lord, the exigencie of Tyme, with the request of some Friends & acquaintances, did first vrge to this attempt, for their pri∣vate vse; which by accident you viewing, your will was, (which alwayes is to mee an absolute Commandement) I should publish the same: My boldness now is in presenting it you. And because it doeth (as it were) theoreticallie pervestigiate the tresses of your Noble Practise abroad; where-by yee did treade the Path of Honour, sealed with a part of your Blood: Therefore, supplicateth your ac∣ceptance, and protection: for none more worthie to dis∣cern, none more able to defend, and to none myne af∣fection tendeth so much in the offer of this my Myte: Vouchsafe it then my Lord, the Shield of your favour, where-by it shall bee able to march through an Armie of Aspersions; and I fortunate it shall bee vsefull to the inexpert. And thus, my Lord, you shall obliedge all those to your beneficence, for granting it both advance∣ment, and a pasport; & also fortifie my weakness, in what I zealouslie can approue my self,
MY LORD
