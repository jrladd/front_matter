RIght honourable, and vertuous Ladie, I find, that our chiefest and greatest incourage∣ment vnto vertue, is to heare the memorie of the vertuous, continued with the carefull re∣portes of worthy writers: for that such testi∣monie is both a president for our liues, and al∣so foreshewes after death, our fames. Like∣wise it as necessarie, to register the liues of the leaude, that the ter∣ror of their punishments and infamie, may feare vs to offend. So that moued with these consideraetions (among a number my leasurable labours) I haue faithfully (though not curiously) translated the mo∣dest and noble life of a Boemian Lady, with the fall of two Hun∣garian barons: which vnaduisedly wagered the spoyle of her cha∣stitie. Which simple toyle of mine, as a testimonie of the reuerent dutie, I owe vnto you (vnder the title of the Arbor of Vertue) I humbly present to your Ladiship, to the intent that when you are wearied, with the dispatch of necessarie cares and causes, you may recreate your honourable minde, with the mylde report of this Ladies good behauiours. Wholy assured that as you liue∣ly present her vertues: you wil likewise, both de∣fend her fame, and my honest indeuour, with the countenaunce of your regarded name. From my lodging in Hol∣borne, the .15. of Octo∣ber. 1576.
