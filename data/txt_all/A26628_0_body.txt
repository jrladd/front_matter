GREAT SIR,
AS You are God's Vicegerent here upon Earth, so You are most justly and duely to be accounted my Dread Soveraign; and, without just Cause, I should not presume thus to make mine Approach to Your most Sacred MAJESTY. Now, as Life, and an honest Reputation, are to me of an equal Value, and one Sir Richard Blackam hath blackened and whispered away my Reputation on the Grounds of a Causeless Statute of Bankrupt, maliciously ta∣ken out against me by one Samuel Moyer, after a long and wrongfull Prosecu∣tion of me in Your MAJESTY's High Court of Chancery, where with most excessive Charge and Trouble I was, for many Years, forc'd to defend my self; and after I had bin in some measure Righted by a Decree in that Court, Three of his Counsel being afterwards made Lords Commissioners for the Custody of the Great Seal, Reversed my Decree, that had bin Signed and Enrolled, without any man∣ner of Reason, only for to please their Client, of whom, for many Years together, they had all received extravagant great Fees; and then the most Reverend and Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, by Reversing their Decree of Re∣versal, confirmed again unto me my Right upon full Hearing of the Cause, brought before them upon mine Appeal; (for which I pray God to reward them.) But lea∣ving me to the Law for my Damages sustained by the said Statute of Bankrupt, I have there had a Tryal with the said Moyer, who being quitted by the inge∣nuity of a favourite Counsel, and the inclinations of the Judge, I was forced to pay him Costs; and the Court being told by the Judge, that my Remedy at Common-Law did lie only against the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, by bringing mine Action against them; which the Judge knowing very well, is an unpracticable Thing, unless I had a Million of Money to spend, hath left me without Remedy; for 'tis Money, and not Law, that now doth the Justice in many, if not most Cau∣ses;

and if a Man have enough of That, he is sure of his Cause in any Case. But as such Practices are unknown to Your MAJESTY, that abominates all Injustice, and such Ways of Unrighteousness, so doubtless Your most Excellent MAJESTY will not allow Money to stand in Competition with, and jostle Ju∣stice out of its place in Your MAJESTY's Government; which doubtless Your MAJESTY desires may be a Righteous Government. I doe therefore hum∣bly make this my most humble Petition of Appeal to Your most Gracious and Sa∣cred MAJESTY, to be relieved against the manifold Oppressions I lie under by mine Unparallell'd Grievances, now shewed to Your MAJESTY: For ha∣ving paid to the full all manner of Taxes due to Your MAJESTY, which have bin required of me to pay; every Penny whereof being so much more than I have gained since the Year 1690, when the said Moyer most wrongfully and causelesly took out the said Statute of Bankrupt against me. I will hope for as much Clemency from Your MAJESTY, being the Great Christian Soveraign and Father of this Nation, as the Grand Signior shews to any manner of person, Native or Foreigner, that by the Turkish Laws hath bin aggrieved in his Domi∣nions: It being the Manner and Custom there, in Turky, for any person what∣soever (that at the Turkish Law hath bin aggrieved by the partiality and injustice of an Unjust Caddee or Judge) to put Fire upon his Head, with which he standing in the way, or but in sight, as the Sultan or Grand Signior is passing along when he rides abroad. As soon as ever the Grand Signior or Sultan espies the Fire, he certainly and immediately commands the Man to be brought unto him; and then hearing his Complaint, redresses him without any delay; and many times the unjust Judge is put to Death, by being pounded all to Mash, and squobb'd all of a Lump in a Mortar. Now, though such Ceremonies are not used here, yet I doe most humbly hope this my most humble Petition of Appeal to Your MAJESTY may doe as well: And as I am desirous to approve my self Your MAJESTY's most Loyal and Obedient Subject, so,
Dread Soveraign, I doe most humbly prostrate My self, my Life and mine All at Your MAJESTY's Feet, begging Pardon for this Liberty, that it may be without any Offence: And, as in Duty bound, I shall, whiles I breathe, pray for Your Happiness to continue, and, if it may be possible, to be augmented in this World, and in the World to come Life everlasting.
Amen.
