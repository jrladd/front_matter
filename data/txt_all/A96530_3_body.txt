SIR,
THis Sermon hath been questioned once, and may again be questioned. It hath bin questioned by others before now: And now it may be questioned by your self. You may now questiō it for being publick: But others have thought their questioning of it the more pertinent for being thus long private; For their Question was not about the Matter of it, but the Authour. No Tittle in it, that I know of; but the Title to it was in Question. Had it been one of Smyths, or Pembles, one of Heirons, or Wheatelys Sermons, questionlesse the Questionaries had been so lectured, and preached in it, that they needed not have been so absonous in publick, as to my face to Question, whether it were mine own? I can but wonder at the Question: for I never borrowed other mens stilts to hide the lamenesse of my fantasie before the poorest halting Cripples. I confesse, I ever thought it lawfull to steale a Sen∣tence in a Sermon; but not so to steale a whole Sermon. Nor was it any One, but many Authours that afforded help unto me in composing this. My Purse was never able as yet to purchase Bookes enongh to make a complete Library: But such Bookes as I have, I love to reade, and such Bookes as I reade, I love to make use of; Yet is it not my use to take all the Principall of any instead of the use. The Prophet David2 Sam. 24. 24. would not sacrifice unto the God of Israel, of that which cost him nothing. Nor do I use to offer that before the same God unto his people, which cost me nothing but a Groat, or Teston at the Statio∣ners shop. Such as it is it has been offered once, and againe unto the people from the Pulpit; And now, such as it was; it is to be offered to them from the Presse, for I cannot but own it every where, and de∣sire your Worship to own the humblest of your servants in it
