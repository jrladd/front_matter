RJght Worship∣full, you may iustly maruell what importunity might bring my impolished
Meditations so quickly to the Presse, but (being much against my will enforced to let them try their fortune in the world) why I should be∣queath them to your pro∣tection no man needs to wonder, considering the many encouragements, and continuall kind∣nesses which I haue re∣ceiued from you, vnto whose fauour, next vn∣der God, I ascribe the
greatest part of my wel∣being, since first I came vnder your gouerne∣ment. I know well you haue many learned Scribes in that Naioth, whereof God hath made you the chiefe Seer, more worthie to haue shewne their forward∣nesse in this kinde then my selfe, who can leaue more learning for the gleaning, then my whole vintage. (For I am but
one of the least, and low∣est amongst all the sons of my mother) yet seeing you may iustly challenge the same interest in mee, which Paul did in Phi∣lemon, Thou owest vnto me thy owne selfe, I am willing to dis∣charge some part of my debt, if you shall allow of this coine and im∣pression for currant: and yet euen in this, shall J runne farther vpon
the old score, as being rather in your debt for your kinde receiuing of it, then out of your debt by repaying so slender thankes. J know that the least Sabboth daies iourney of your owne, is more worth then any whole yeares paines of mine: Yet am I confi∣dent, you will both con∣sider my yeares, which are but few, and the time J had, which
was but short, and my many other occur∣rences, wherewith in the meane time I was interrupted, and then accept of this for tryall, as if it were the extract of some purer and bet∣ter wit. The Lord prosper your daies, di∣rect your heart, and blesse all your labours, to the glorie of his Name, and the good of his Church: From
Queenes Colledge in Oxford.
