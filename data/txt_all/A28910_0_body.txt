My Lord,
IT needs not create Wonder in any, to find your Lordships great Name in the Front of this Sermon, who will but consider the Faithful Service you did, and the great veneration you had for that Excellent Princess, of whom (in Mournful Accents) it speaks. The Performance, how mean soe∣ver, is the natural product of just Grief and Sor∣row for the Common Loss of us all, and therefore needs not fear a favourable acceptance from your Honour. But my Lord, there is ano∣ther Reason, that entitles this Dedication to your Lordship: I must always gratefully remember a singular instance of your Favour and Kindness to me, and I thought I could not better express my Gratitude, than by making a publick Acknowledg∣ment
thereof. The Discourse, I here present your Lordship with, has nothing to recommmend it, but Truth and Plainness: Astonishing Grief, such as ours, slights and disdains the mean and useless Or∣naments of empty Rhetorick: My chief Aim and Design in Preaching it, was to make Men better; to which Pious end, they having so great an Ex∣ample set before them for their imitation, I hope, it may conduce, now, in Submission to the importu∣nities of several (some of which for their Piety and Friendship had great influence over me) it ap∣pears in publick. That God Almighty may long continue your Lordship the Delight of this King∣dom, for the Impartial distribution of Justice, and the Reformation of the Abuses and Corruptions of the late Times, is the most sincere and hearty pray∣er of, My Lord,
