LOuing, and beloued. The vvords of a dying father, or of a dying frend are vvont to take deepe impression in the minds, & memories of good natures. Whose vvords shall pearce, if the vvords of our Christ our dying Christ, and that for vs, & his last also. Whose I say if not his? To you I send the last vvords

of Christ, in the last place, yet you are not the least in my loue. The first in intention, is last in exce∣cution. And nothing is conveayed to the intellectuall povvers that is not first in the sensible parts. It vvas gods purpose of our Christ euen in the creatiō, that he should be thus vpon the crosse. See then your Christ at his last. Tune your dolefull dumps to a sad soule, and ioy in sobbs. For he prayes, cries, yells, promiseth, perfecteth all, that vve may be all in all vvith god. What can be more? Christ passion is the modell of our profes∣sion, yea the medall of our perfe∣ction. For gods strength is per∣fected in our vveakenes.
We may sovve in teares, vve shall reape in ioy. Let my spring be vvett so that I may haue a

plentifull Autume I care not. Vir dolorum can best tune his voice to dolours. If god vvill haue it so, His vvill be done. He did so vvith his ovvne. We cannot imagine our condition free. God giude vs through all by his sauing grace, To vvhich I shall euer recom∣mend you, and rest.
