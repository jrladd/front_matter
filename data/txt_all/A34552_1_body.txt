AS this Discourse reached the Ears of most, or all, of you from the Pulpit, it now returns to refresh your Memories from the Press; not that I question your steady Loyalty to his Majesty's Per∣son, and true Affection to his Government, nor from any ambitious Temper in me to appear to Print, especially in this Carping Age; but, to gratifie the repeated De∣sires and earnest Sollicitations of some of you to whom I am highly obliged. I therefore make a Present hereof to you; accept of it therefore in the plain Dress in which it was deliver'd. Your Earnest Desires were the Mid∣wife that ushered it into the World; and therefore how mis-shapen soever it is, call it your own. The Design
of it is laudable, and it may serve, by the Blessing of God, (if it fall into the hands of any such) to confirm the Minds of those that are wavering in their Affections to the Present Government, to convince and silence the Enemies thereof, and perswade all to a Holy and Chri∣stian Emulation, of exceeding each other in their Loy∣alty to the KING, in their true Affections to his Go∣vernment, and diligent Endeavours, in their several Capacities, for the Preservation of both, and to engage all in a Charitable and Christian Deportment one toward another. And that it may have this happy Effect upon all, is the earnest Desire and hearty Prayer of,
Worshipful and Beloved,
