To my worthy friends of S. Brid∣gets
(commonly Brides) Pa∣rish
in London.
The Blessings of this and
a better life.
JAcob, when sending
his Son into Aegypt,
advised them to car∣ryGen. 43. v. 11.
to the Governour thereof,
(their unknown Brother) a
Present, a little balme, and a
little honey, spices, and myrrhe,
nutts, and almonds. Herein both
the quality and quantity of the
guift is considerable:

The Quality: alas! look on
them in themselves, and they
were but mean. Aegypt (to
give it it's due) excelled Pa∣lestine
in many Commodities
which were better to barter
with forraigne Nations, as
wicked men in all Ages sur∣passe
the servants of GOD in
outward accommodations.
The Quantity, but a little of
each. To carry much would
have been but the more bur∣then
to their Cattle which car∣ried
it, and perchance lesse ac∣ceptable
to him that recei∣ved
it.

However, one thing much
commended this present, be∣cause
(as the Text saith) they
were the best fruits of the Land;
and no rationall person can
expect better than what is best.
Some conformity there is be∣twixt
their Present, & this my
Dedication; none is more sen∣sible
than my self of the mean∣nesse
thereof: Besides Zoar,
is it not a little one? yet is it
the best that my barren condi∣tion
can for the present af∣ford,
on which account I
comfortably presume it will

be as kindly taken as it is cor∣dially
tendred.
All I will adde is this; The
Holy Spirit compareth good

prosecution of which Meta∣phor,
I hope that these nailes
which were entred into your
hearts at the preaching of them,
shal now be rivetted into them
by the printing thereof; which
is the hearty desire of
