Most Dread and Gracious Soveraign:
THE Glorious Sun, who
communicates his beams
and light, not onely to the
Stars and Heavens where
he doth reside, but also to
the Ayre and Water, and
the remotest part of the
Earth, where the lowest
shrubs are cherished with his Influence, is a fit
Emblem of your Majesty whose pious care was
expressed not onely for the Nobles and Courtiers,

that have the honour to be near your Person; but
also for the Commons and inferiour people, that
have the happiness to be in your mind, in ap∣pointing
and accepting the directions of the
Learned Colledge of London, for the cure of,
and preservation from the Pestilence.
In a great fire begun in the City, when the
Sheriffs and other Officers are principally called
to the quenching of it, and though they discharge
their places with singular discretion and fidelity,
yet many private persons of an active and pub∣lick
spirit, are admitted to yeeld their best assist∣ance.
In an Invasion of a foreign Enemy, or Insur∣rection
of a Domestick Rebel, others may take
Armes besides the Life-Guard and Trayn'd-Bands.
The Plague is a Fire that is not easily quench∣ed,
an Enemy which the Vndaunted Valour of
the Invincible English Nation, is neither able
nor willing to encounter with. For their sakes
these Directions are published and presented at
your Majesties Feet, and may be useful not one∣ly
for the cure of those at Land, but also
for the preservation of them at Sea; in both

which places your Majesty hath many thousands,
in whose breasts the true English good natured
and loyal qualities of Love and Fear, Valour and
Obedience, do most religiously meet, and who
would willingly part with▪ not onely their Lives,
but even their own ssence, to add to the great∣ness
of their Soveraign: of which number is he,
who daily prays that your Majesty may obtain all
your Desires from Heaven, and be obeyed in all
your Commands on Earth; that being safely
guarded from all dangers and diseases, you may
live to see your Magnificent Intentions take ef∣fect,
not onely for the good of England, but of all
Christendome, Africa, and the Indies, and bless
the Age we live in, with the Miracles of your
Wisdom and Government:
Your Majesties most Loyal Subject,
and humble Servant,
