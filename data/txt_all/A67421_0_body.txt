I Hope I may without craving pardon for my pre∣sumption commend a few lines unto you: Its the manner of those that write Books to Dedicate them to such persons as either from whom they have recei∣ved Favours, or Secondly, live at present in the sense and enjoyment of Favours received, or thirdly expect Favours for the future. There's a concurrence of all these in your Self, for first you bestowed your self upon me, which as Solomon speaking of a good wife, (saith) She is a Price far above Rubies: The Favours received among others were these, first you supported your self and three Children by the Milk of your own Breasts, when I was in restraint, Secondly when I have been surrounded and distressed with a Regiment of how-shall-I-does and what shall-I-does, I have found en∣tertainment at your hands, especially by those two In∣mates of yours that cohabit with you, those Ladies of Honour, I mean the Lady Peace and the Lady Pati∣ence. Thirdly, A Traveller told me that he was in a place called Canida some part of the West Indies where the Beares all the Winter when the ground was frozen and hard did lye in their Dens, and were pre∣served alive only by sucking, and lcking of their Paws a very strange Providence: My self and four children have had a great part of our support this hard time,
 by the licking of your fingers, I mean by the labours and endeavours of your hands and fingers. Fourthly, When I have been without imployment, and had the offer of severall Inns, which we might have kept; you would by no means hearken to that, telling me that there were several temptations attended that Cal∣ling, with which I might be overtaken; besides, that I was an ancient Man, your self a young Woman, and that you had nothing but your credit to carry you through the world, which might be impeached by that means, and therefore I must forbear that; next, whereas I had many small Calls to the Pulpit, some of them not exceeding eight pound per annum, some 26 l. nay 30 l. per annum, with my dyet, and the use of a Study of Books, where I might have been furni∣shed with good store of Ware to have carried to the Shop, and much ado I had to keep my self out of the Pulpit, although it were no hard matter for me to stand Centinel two hours in a week in a Pulpit to say Ser∣mons with as much ease as many do: your answer hath been; Husband, I might have been more happy in the world than to have had you, yet upon condition you will neither sell Ale nor Preach, I will be contented with my condition, although it should come to be but bread and water, and thus you laid me neck and heels together, and were instrumental to keep me both from Pot and Pulpit, which are the two last shifts many men undertake. I have one thing more to give you thanks for, you have born and brought me forth four Chil∣dren in my latter dayes, the youngest wherof, al∣though as yet not a quarter old, I would be loath to leave for the King of Spains Golden Mines at Perein or at Potosey; and what I shall expect for the future, is,
 that you will be as good to me as formerly you have been, I desire you not to be better, its impossible you should; Neverthelesse, I shall blaze your infirmities to the world, and yet without besmutting your Repu∣tation, you can neither chide nor scold; and when you have had provocations thereunto, I have deman∣ded of you how you could be silent; your answer hath been, I want wit, there are some men in the world could wish their wives were as witlesse as your self. Upon these Considerations, in token of my thankful∣nesse, I have commended this Paper unto you, it is an old piece which I met withall more than fourty years since, and learned by heart, and kept it in my head so long, and lost very little of it, having not seen the Copy in all that time, I was resolved at last to lay it somewhere else, and now bequeath it to you. You will say in reading of this little Paper, that the same things that were acted by the Prelates are acted with us at this day, and therefore may conclude that those Prelates are still alive, or else that there is a new re∣surrection of them. No wife, not so; but you will find that the sinners that lived in the first age of the world, have those that resemble them still in their practises. As it was in the dayes of Noah, &c. As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also re∣sist the truth. And as the Child of the Bond-woman persecutes the Son of the free, even so 'tis now, and so 'tis now: and this by reason of that enmity that is between the Seed of the Woman and the Serpent: The wind bloweth where it listeth; by the wind Wife is meant you know the spirit. And those Prelates are of those Angels, or very much like them as ever they can look mentioned in the Revelations, that stand at
 the four corners of the earth, holding the winds that they blow not, and that none may buy or sell but they that receive the mark either in their hand or in their fore-head. I shall conclude my Epistle with the Marriners speech who having been at Sea, and having met with a prosperous Voyage when he comes home, telling of it saith thus, All this we did with a little Ship, and a great God: I shall leave you and yours but a little of the world more than to each Child A∣dams Combe, I mean their fingers, which with Gods Blessing may prove a good Portion, yet as I hope shall leave both you and them in the everlasting Armes of a great God, to whose Providence and Protection I commend you, which is the desire of him who is


Reader, If thou see the Paper I have Commended unto my Wife, I hope thou wilt not be offended at it; Cannot a poor Man and his Wife talk together by the fire side but the world must be troubled at it? There are many Thousand Families talk after this rate, Hanc veniam petamusque damusque, what leave I take, I'le afford thee to do as much, if thou art angry, who can help it; Farewell.
