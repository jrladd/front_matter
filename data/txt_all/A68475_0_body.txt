Imperiall and Incomparable Maiestie,
SEeing with me, all of me, is in your Royall possession, and whatsoeuer pieces of mine haue heeretofore, vnder other starres passed the pub∣like view, come now of right to be vnder the predomination of a Power, that both contain's all their perfections, and hath influences of a more sublime na∣ture, I could not but also take in this part (wherof time had worn-out the edition) which the world hath long since had of mine, and lay it at your Sacred feet, as a me∣moriall of my deuoted dutie, and to shew that where I am, I must be all I am, and can not stand dispersed in my obseruance, being wholly (and therein happy)
