MY LORD,
IF I have set down, the only opportunity I
ever had of kissing your Lordships Hands,
amongst the happy Encounters of my Life,
and take this occasion, so many Years after,
to tell you so, your Lordship will not, I hope,
think your self injur'd by such a Declaration
from a Man that honours You; nor condemn
my Ambition, when I publish to the World,
that I am not altogether unknown to You.
Your Lordship, peradventure, may have for∣got
a Conversation so little worthy your re∣membrance:
but the memory of your Lord∣ship's
obliging fashion to me all that time,
can never die with me: and though my Ac∣knowledgment
arrives thus late at you, I
have never left it at home when I went a∣broad
into the best Company. My Lord, I

cannot, I would not flatter you, I do not
think your Lordship capable of being flatter'd,
neither am I inclin'd to do it to those that
are: but I cannot forbear to say, that I
then receiv'd such an impression of your Ver∣tue,
and Noble Nature, as will stay with me
for ever. This will either excuse the Liberty
I presume to take in this Dedication, or, at
least, make it no wonder; and I am so confi∣dent
in your Lordship's Generosity, that I
assure my self you will not deny your Protecti∣on
to a Man whose greatest Publick Crime is
that of an ill Writer. A better Book (if
there be a better of the kind (in the Origi∣nal
I mean) had been a Present more fitly
suited to your Lordship's Quality and Merit,
and to my Devotion. I could heartily wish
it such; but as it is, I lay it at your Lord∣ship's
Feet, together with
My Lord,
