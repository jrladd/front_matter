RIght Worshipfull, if Christs owne Disci∣ples, though feruent in Spirit, yet in acknowledge∣ment of their ignorance, were

desirous that he should teach them (as Iohn also had taught his Disciples) how to pray. How much more neede then haue we, in these our daies of frozen zeale, to desire instruc∣tion in this duty. If much bab∣bling, & blind deuotion were acceptable before God, the Papist would get the Goale: If turning vp the eyes to hea∣uē, with bended knees to pub∣licke view, but hallow hearts (deceiuing men) were accepta∣ble to God, the Hypocrite would out-strip al: If not pray∣ing at all, were acceptable be∣fore God, the Atheist would attaine heauen before all. But if all of these be so farre wide

thereof as that the one's not praying at all, and the others, praying amisse, bee both turned into sinne; then well may wee say, Lord teach vs how to pray, that our prayers, or not pray∣ing at all, bee not turned into sinne also.
Many of vs, though liuing in the bright sun-shine of the Gospell, yet know not How, For what, or To whom, to pray. How our hearts are vtterly vnprepared, our thoughts wan∣dring, our cogitations musing vpon vanities: For what, when wee should pray for Spirituall things, wee craue earthly and carnall things, when afflictions are needfull to bee heaped vp∣on

vs, wee are impatient vnder the least burthen, desiring all things that may keepe downe our proud flesh, and prepare vs better to Godward, to bee re∣moued: To whom, Some pray to Mary, some to Peter, some to Paul, creatures of God; Some to Crucifixes, stocks, & stones, the works of mens hāds, forsaking the true God, and blaspheming his holy name by idolatry and Paganisme. These Sermōs fol∣lowing (right Worshipfull) in my weake vnderstanding, giue great light (in this kind) vnto the simple, profitable & sound directions to the learned, wholesome instructions vnto all: The Title of the Booke ex∣presseth

sufficiently the sub∣iect therof; The Sermons them∣selues, the Authours exact skill and acute iudgement in han∣dling thereof; whose name, though concealed, yet skilleth it not much, for not the work∣man the worke, but the worke must approue the workeman. Thus much for them both: now for my self; I haue alwaies adiudged a principall part of true honour to consist, as in being vertuous ones selfe, so al∣so in protecting and defending vertue and vertuous actions in others; To the honour there∣fore of your names, and there∣in also to expresse my owne loue and duty to your Wor∣ship,

I haue made bold to in∣title you Patrons and Pro∣tectors hereof, that as the worke it selfe is vertuous, so also your names may heerein remaine vpon record vnto po∣sterity, The Honourable Protectors of vertue.
