Most worthy Sir,
GReat favours do oblige to great ac∣knowledgments: You have been a∣bundant to me in the one, and I should appear vilely ingrateful, should I be de∣fective to you in the other. Wherefore, though it is not within the sphere of my power propor∣tionably to requite your goodness, yet it shall ever be within the circumference of my will to remember it. Pertinax sit memoria deben∣tium, was excellent good advice, though from the mouth of a Heathen: Hence Seneca com∣pares the Graces to youthful Maidens, and the reason of that parallel he saith is this, quia non debet beneficiorum memoria senescere, be∣cause the Records of benefits conferred, must never wax old. That was a good expression of one in Euripides, . I hate the thanks of such friends as wither with e.

For this cause therefore have I presented your fair hands with this small Treatise, to let the world know of your engagements on me, and my readiness to make such requital, as my poor capacity enables me to return. Reddit bene∣ficium qui libenter debet.
Sir, I doubt not of your kinde acceptance of this mean Missive, with us much generous in∣dulgence, as my heart offers it with cordial alacrity. And what is wanting in my short and streightned compensations, I shall beseech God to enlarge and make complete by his bles∣sings. It is symmachus his expression, Pro beneficiis si non simus solvendo, coelestibus delegamus virtutibus: So that I hope I may say with Ausonius, Tibi coepit Deus de∣bere pro nobis.
Sir, I shall not trouble you with more words, onely give me leave to adde this, That I am yours in a thousand bonds, and must ever remain bound to reverence your Person, and love your Vertues. This is the Resolu∣tion of

Limesfield, Novemb. 29. 1658.
