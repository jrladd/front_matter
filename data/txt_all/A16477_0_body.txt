RIght honorable, and my singuler good Lorde, I haue marueled vpon occasion, of late, that amonge the numbers of bookes, in their seueral kyndes, not one∣ly by their auctors diligently deuised, but surely by the printers of these dais, for the most part procured, and to theire exceeding great charges, faythfullye & exactlye published: I finde so fewe, that I coulde almoste haue saide none, to haue written in our natiue tongue, of the science and skill of Armory. Truely in my oppinion, a very fruitefull necessary, and honorable argument, but might I deeme, or were it rashnesse, as Tullye in his Tusculans, in the comparison be∣tweene the Romains & Grecians, which might excede other, or be more auncient in knowledge, sayth of such, as of thē lay neg∣lecte, Honos alit artes omnes{que} incendunt' ad studia gloria, Surely not vnlike, but as in al other things, so in science, what auayleth seruice, where soueraigntie is neglected, what actiui∣tie where men lie downe to sleepe, with sloth: what loue, what frendship, where no man buildes on fayth or credyt, so takè honor from lawe, rewarde from Phificke, admiration from Ma∣thematicalls, humilitie and zeale, from heauenly science, and who sets his sonne to schoole for them: no doubt Tully saide ful wisely, keepe backe rewarde, and learning adew. Yet somme there are, that feede not altogether of this humor, and they rake together the fewe sparcles of knowledge hyd, and almoste dead in the ashes of obliuion, and eyther them selfes builde a fyer

therof, or geeue occasion to others, such one was of late specially in this kind of Herehaultry, a very fruteful and worthy writer master Gerard Leigh, and suche do I offer my self at this presēt meaning to adde somewhat farther, or geeue occasion to others, not drawen by hope of reward, which rather would haue kept me back, but honor of the science, loue of my coūtrey, and espe∣cially my bounden and duitifull estimacion of your honorable fauor: wherunto as I do with reuerence offer and dedicate thys simple thing (scarce worthe the reading in respect of the hande∣ling, yet for the substāce, not to be altogether neglected) so I most humbly beseech your honor to accept the same, and bee Patron thereof: wherby you shal not onely staye, and rere vp this decli∣ning knowledge, to your great renowme, but bind me for euer, by al maner of duities, and specially to pray for your honora∣ble estate, long to continue in fauor with God, credyt with youre soueraigne, honour wyth your countrie, fidelitye wyth your Peeres, and loue towardes Ar∣morye.
