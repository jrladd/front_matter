SIR,
I Present, with all Humility, to Your pious consideration, a Defence of that cause, which is, and ought to be infinitely dearer to You, then the riches of China, or the wealth of the West-India Company; as being that, which Divine Providence hath so signally carried on with a Palm of Victory; and promiseth (if we be not deficient to our selves) to crown with the O∣live-branch of peace: I mean Religion, and the Royal Prerogative, in opposition to Ro∣mish Superstition, and Fanatick disorder, and sedition; which is compendiously set forth in that form of Abjuration, and unparallel'd Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy, intend∣ed to conjure all Romanized, and other Re∣cusant Dissenters within the circle of verity, and obedience. In vindication whereof, I have
 taken up the Gantlet against all Antichristian, and Antimonarchical challengers; not doubt∣ing, but that, upon this entring the Lists, I shall be censured for undertaking so great a work, so far beyond my weak abilities. But it is satis∣faction enough to my self and may be to others, that I was not induced to it out of any unballan∣ced conceipt of my self, whose personal defects (according to that of the Oracle, ) are the onely thing I presume to know: But under∣took it in obedience to him, who exhorted all his Brethren earnestly to contend for the faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints; now torn in pieces, like Hippolytus his body, by Babylonish Wolves, Jesuits, Quakers, and Fifth-Monarchists, swarming like Locusts out of the Infernal pit; which daily invade our Folds, worrie our Flocks, and seduce them both from Piety▪ & Loyalty: whom to countermine (while the Sword of Justice sleepeth not) a ne∣cessity lyeth upon every faithful Pastour, not onely by the power of the Keys, as Preach∣ing, Praying, and Discoursing, (when oppor∣tunity shall fairly tender it self) but even by
 Penning; though we must expect our writings will be dealt withall by them, as the tongue of Cicero was, after his death, by Cleopatra, Wife to Mark Anthony, who thrust it through and through with needles, and stabbed it again and again with poysoned pens.
For my inscribing to it Your Patronage; as gratefulness may plead my duty, and obli∣gation on the one hand; so your signal suffer∣ings, and activity for His Sacred Majesty, may sway acceptance on the other, if the hand∣ling of it were answerable to the subject. I con∣fess, my person, and parts are over-mean to engage in such an excelse, and sublime Pro∣vince. For, if Alexander would commit the proportion of his Body to be effigiated by none, but Lysippus; Apelles himself could never set out the outward beauty of his Face, but slubbered, and far short of the native vivacity: How then shall I, poor Zanie, em∣blazon the Seraphick sublimity of the Royal Prerogative, the livelyest Representative upon earth of that great Tetragrammaton in Heaven? But as he, that dwells on high,
 despiseth not things below; so I hope my Mite, and Goats-hair, may be accepted, seeing it was intended in all sincerity for the honour of God, and of our dread Sovereign's Royal Majesty, and to confirm his liege people in the right faith, and true love, and obedience of his most just, and gracious Government. As an Angel of God, so is my Lord the King to discern good, and bad; therefore the Lord will be with him: 2 Sam. xiv. 7.
I have no more to apologize; but pray, that he, which ruleth in the Armies of Hea∣vens, would crown with the blessings of his right, and of his left hand, Your Self, Your truly virtuous Lady, Your hopeful Issue to the glory of God, and comfort of all Your Rela∣tions; which is the daily petition of him, whom you have obliged for ever,
