YOu are known and re∣puted to be (as the Virtuosi say) a lover of Art; The inside of your Habita∣tion speaks it, and truly one good inside is to be prefer∣ed before a hundred of such as signifie but a show of something; the love one hath to Musick argueth a well composed Harmonius mind; so the love to Art (consisting in perfect Rules,



Dimensions and Formes) infers the party to be a true Rational, who blusheth not at the Bees their Geometri∣call contrivances even in the dark.
I do present you with one of the Examples for true Building; I hope you will reflect on it as coming from,
Honoured Sir,
