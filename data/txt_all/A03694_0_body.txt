Christian Lord:
HAuing a great desire, in my great want of meanes, to expresse my selfe by some Office and Testi∣monie for your Honors good thoughts of mee, in words of vndeserued commendation: the rather because one Countrie , in

which you were borne Noble, and one Countrey now containes vs, in which you gouerne with honour and loue: I light vpon certaine briefes of Lectures deliuered by me, vpon a very worthy Psalme, and be∣fore a worthy Audience, your Honours immediate honourable Predecessour, and others, his reuerend and graue associates then in place. A Psalme made by a King, and for Kings, which (also) may indifferent∣ly, serue as a Table of direction for all States and Policies, vnder that which is Kingly.
Therefore in the mirrour of this Psalme, and example of him who made it, as in a true Glasse, your Honour may be∣hold clearely the right and liuely image and face of a Christian Gouernour and go∣uernement. And, though no Psalme, as it were pearle, in this Booke of Psalmes, or boxe of pearles can iustly displease: yet, as in the estimation of precious things That may please vs for one vse, for which another (being to no such vse) will not please so well, albeit precious for the vse it hath; so it is in all these excellent Psalmes, the Iewels of Gods Church. For, for some purposes, one

Psalme may be fitter, that is, more excellent then another, though all be excellent and do edifie greatly in their seuerall kindes. And indeed, as when the Prophet gaue his mind to the preparing of those things that might serue for the building of the materiall temple, He disposed in his minde to what vse this or that Iewell or waight of gold and siluer, and a number of other things should be applied: so for these Psalmes (most of which were penned by this sweet singer of Israel) the Prophet hauing sto∣red and layd them vp, as the ornaments of Gods Church, in his Sanctuary, for pub∣like vse, and as precious stuffe for the buil∣ding of a spirituall Temple to God; He had great consideration whereto each Psalm should serue. Wherefore some he made for the Sabbath and Temple chiefly, some (indifferently) for all dayes and places: some for a remembrance of the generall, some for a more speciall remembrance of the particu∣lar workes of God to his Church: some for meditation and practise, some for Do∣ctrine and Prayer: some for comforts, some for threatnings: some for confession of sinnes, some of conuersion from sinne; all

which hee consecrated as Tables of perpe∣tuall thankefulnesse to GOD in his House, better then the three hundred shields and two hundreth targets that Salomon put in his house at Ierusalem, though they were all of beaten gold, 1 King. 10.16.17.
Now, as Gods wisedome by Dauid thus sorted and disposed these holy Songs, that they might be sutable to all the occasi∣ons and necessities of the Church for euer: so in more speciall manner, the same wise∣dome of GOD by him, did indite this Psalme for instruction, that it might teach euen Kings, and all vnder Kings in autho∣ritie, how to please and serue God in those high places, and that they might vnder∣stand, and not forget that religious seruices belong to the Noblest as well as to the mea∣nest, and in reason, rather to great per∣sons then to common men. For, who should doe most worke, but hee that receiueth most wages? and who should pay the greatest rent, but hee that hath the largest de∣mise?
This Psalme therefore (my Honoured Lord) deserueth right well your best inten∣tions, both for the contemplatiue vse of it,

and your practicall in your Familie, and the Prouince. It is Gods Psalme, or charge to you, and such as you are, by Da∣uid. But because the Text of it (short as it is) is like to Tapestrie, which (being foulded vp) sheweth but a part of that which is wrought, and (being laid open) sheweth plainely to the eye all the worke that is in it: therefore I, though most vn∣worthy) haue presumed thus to vnfolde this Tapestrie of the holy Ghost, in so ex∣cellent a Psalme, and to hang vp the cham∣ber of it in a very meane Exposition, giuen vnto it by my weake iudgement and gifts, which in humblest good-will, out of loue and dutie, I humbly tender into your Lordships owne hands, knowing the same to be willing, and ready, graciously to pardon, and beare with things somewhat meanely done, but with a well-meaning heart; and to respect, not so much the gift, as the good-will of the giuer, in matters of this na∣ture.
Howsoeuer I haue dealt, the Psalme is the same that euer it was: which if I haue so opened, that is, so to the life of the Pro∣phets words, and so vnfolded, that your

Honour may discerne of all the pieces and sundry workes and matters contained in it, as in a piece of Tapestrie opened you may: I humbly thanke God, and wish the fruit of it in your Lordships heart; and, from so good a treasurie in the places of your Honours publike and priuate emploi∣ments to fructisie there: that is, turne it into a Prayer; that you may follow in the steppes of Dauids obedience to it; doing as hee did.
Often pray this Psalme to God (my good Lord:) let it bee your meditation, and counsellour in all your high affaires, and when you would stirre the wheeles of all good graces in you for some holy and pro∣fitable dispensation of Iustice in the same, vse it. Lastly, and for my selfe, I humly beseech your Honour, fauourably to remit this trespasse of my presumption, respecting rather, what I would doe then what is done, and in how homely manner. So, not further to trouble your Honour: I pray God hear∣tily, that, as hee hath honoured you with a double honour of Birth and Office, so hee would accompanie your earthly ho∣nour with such abundance of heauenly

graces to goe with the same, that here you may abound in euery good worke, to the praise of God, and, in Heauen, may re∣ceiue the pure crowne of Righteous∣nes and glory, which is laid vp for you, and for all who loue and looke for the comming of Iesus Christ, to whose grace most humbly I commend your Honour now and euer.
