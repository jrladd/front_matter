RIght Worshipfull, ever since my childish yeares were adopted with that mutuall sense of seeing, and imboldned with your favourable smiles; I presumed to survey the manifold favours, that I found writ∣ten in the Margent of your love: which seeing, I finde my selfe so deepely indebted to your Worship, that although I should endeavour my selfe, even to the last gaspe, yet were it impossible for me to deserve, or make you restitution for the least of them: but as heretofore I still presumed on your kind∣nesse, presenting to your Worship the frownes of fortune, so rudely and roughly polished, that I feare you will smile with Alexander at the crooked deformi∣ty of Vulcan: yet sometimes the mind is as well plea∣sed to heare of Pans, homely fancies, as of Hercules re∣nowned labours; Homer wrote verses as well on Irus the Beggar, as Eurymachus the wooer: Apollo gives O∣racles as well to the poore for his mite, as the rich for

his treasure: Darius aswell received the rough unpo∣lish'd colors of Mison, as the curious pictures of Apelles, Therefore I beseech you, to shroud this imperfect Pamphlet, vnder your worships patronage: assuring my selfe that your worships learned education, & vertuous disposition, will be a sufficient defence to protect me from the enuious tongues of the scorning Sycophants, and hoping as Iupiter and his Sonne, vouchsafed to lye in Philemons poore cottage: so I hope your worship will excuse my slender skill, & accept of my willing mind, and when you haue giuen them a fauorable view, with Minerua vnder your golden Target couer a deformed Owle: so hoping for more then yet I haue deserued, I rest, wishing you the happie successe of hearts content, where I leaue you to the Heavens disposing.
