Gentlemen:
THE unhappinesse to be amongst the low∣est of men, for parts and ortune, can∣not hinder mee from the saisaction which I receive in my selfe, that none is possessed with a more eager passion of contributing towards the advancing Virginia to that degree of felicity which the bounty of nature, richnesse of soyle, and temperature of Climate designed her to: and were my power but of as strong a Wing as my inclinations and desires, that above-example Countrey should be placed in such a Zenith of stability, wealth, and glory, that it should behold all the other Nationall happinesses o he World in a Sphere beneah her; and her Merchans Adventurers and Planters, like so many Load-starres to conduct Mankinde into an innocent O∣cean of unathom'd wealth of unrocky prosperity.
No Countrey under the Snne is lesse ingratefull then Virginia, if she be but justly courted, but to Complement a Virgin for her affection by breahing smoake in her nostrils,

to expresse our Civilities by vapour; and for all that vast Dowry of spaciousnesse, wealth, bounty of aire, and plenty of provisions, to proffer her a joynture of Tobacco, is a Com∣plement indistinguishable from incivill rudenesse.
What Riches may not the Silke-worme, Vine, Olive, and Almond afford us? By these noble undertakings wee contract China two thousand Leagues nearer to us, and are not trou∣bled though Spaine and Italy were remooved five thousand more distant from us: and if wee could not satisfie the impla∣cable curiosity of our Senses without the Easterne Spices, it is without dispute, that what every Orient hath of Aromatick, would grow without any deterioration in this incomparable Countrey.
Yet if, by some occult propriety of nature, these Spices, and Gummes should not prosper with that successe in the Coun∣trey to which they are onely adoptive, as where they are natu∣rall: The South Sea flowing upon the skirts of this glriously apparrelled Virgin, would not onely furnish us, but (through our meanes) all the Westerne World with whatever the Philip∣pines and China have in their brow, or bosome: which that it may be discovered, a Publique incouragement from the Merchants here, and the Colony there, would awaken all spirits which have any scintillation of Honour, or industry, to under∣take the imployment, effect it undertaken, and by the effect raise an unperishable structure for their owne glory, perpetua∣ted by the publique felicity.
The greatest defect that Colony can with consent complaine of, is their want of shipping, and the greatest with which o∣thers finde themselves perplexed, is the want of industry to build them. If Virginia had not as stately Timber as any other Region whatsoever: if it had not a Soyle naturally in∣viting them to improve her in Iron for Gunnes, Anchors,

and other conveniences; in Hempe for Cordage, Flax for Canvase, and Pine trees for Mast: this defect might be allowed for reall: but where all these concenter, it is as unreasonable to complaine, as for a man seated at a Table covered with excellent provision, to accuse his fortune for suffering him to perish with hunger, because his meat is not digested in his stomack, without putting his hands and teeth to labour.
I could cordially wish that there were such quantity of clea∣red ground in Virginia, that every one at his first arrivall might fix upon the Plough, that the so much discoursed of Staples of Wheat and Rye, might be brought to an absolute ripenesse of perfection: But to imagine so many millions of trees of a facile removall, or that old Planters knowing the benefit thence arising, should part with them to others, and seeke new uncleared grounds for themselves, were meerely to dreame of impossibilities.
But the Vine, Almond, and Olive, may be set where the tree is onely barked about to hinder it from leaving; be∣sides if there were a necessity to have absolutely cleared grounds, (which reason it selfe cannot imagine,) yet foure Acres of ground so cleared for the Vine, will returne (by much) more profit, and lesse trouble, then twenty Acres of Wheat, at such rates as they are prized in the common estimation.
But since this profit reverts to the Purse without the toyle of eradicating trees, as great emolument, as if the ground were altogether treelesse, to what purpose should we court sweat and affliction? or increase our miseries without any addition to our happinesse?
Gentlemen, the happinesse of this Nation depends upon your constancy and prosperity, if you seriously erect these staples, wee shall be free from the imperious usurpations of forraigne Prin∣ces

upon your estates, and shipping, from the rapine of Pirates upon your lives or liberties. The decayed number of our ship∣ping may be resupplyed by encouragement of Carpenters of all Nations, to make use of those materialls which the inimi∣table liberality of this Countrey gratefully presents you with: all Saples (diffusively spread in oher Regions) will meet here united, and we shall arrive to that degree of happinesse, to make our intrade by much exceed our exportations: for the compleating of which, if such an inconsiderable, and lost thing as my selfe, could be any way instrumentall, I should as cheer∣fully hazard my life in the employment, as I now subscribe my selfe,
