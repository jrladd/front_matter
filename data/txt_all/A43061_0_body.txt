MY LORD,
I Am very sensible how much unworthy this following Discourse is of your Lordships judgement, which nature made quick and solid; and Books and studies have advanc'd: yet however, being earnestly importun'd, by some Friends of considerable Rank and Quality, to expose it to common view, and thinking this might be a fit opportunity publickly to ac∣knowledge that mighty favour, which your Lordship was pleased so generously to give, I have ventur'd to inscribe it to your Lordships name, choosing rather to undergo many censures upon it than miss one occasion to evidence to the world how
much I stand oblig'd to your Lordships goodness, for what I there enjoy, where this was preach'd, I own to your Lord∣ships Tule and undoubted Patronage, and my obligation swells the higher, being involv'd in that common debt, which the whole Nation owes to your Lordships Family, one of which was so happy an in∣strument in discovering this bloody Plot, and twould be hard for your Great and Noble Family to bear the brand, that some bot headed Romanists have set, calling this Plot only Cecils contrivance, and for those that reap'd the benefit not to acknowledge the loyalty and good service of a Cecil done to Church and State, and therefore upon these and many more ac∣counts with all gratitude and honour I shall ever indeavonr to express my self,
