MY LORD,
THough since I had the Happiness to be admitted to an Acquaintance with a Person of your Character and Merit, and have had a large share of your Fa∣vour, I have had Obligations to make some publick Acknow∣ledgment of it; yet had I never so fair an Opportunity to do it as this Work, which now craves your Lordship's Accep∣tance, doth afford.
For, such a particular Veneration and profound Affection for the sacred Records as your Lordship, upon all occasions, shews, may not only render this Attempt, to add some Light unto them, acceptable, but even cover the Imperfections that you must needs discover in it.
Since therefore it is customary to dedicate Works of this na∣ture to Persons of great Eminence in Station and more raised Worth, I thought my self obliged to set forth these Labours under your Lordship's Patronage, not only to express my Grati∣tude, but also out of Justice to that Goodness which mov'd
 your Lordship not only to peruse, but to approve this Work, and to suggest many things, which otherwise would have been wanting to it.
I am here carried to say somewhat of the Pattern you set us in an unwearied Diligence in the Discharge of your high Fun∣ction; but I know you cannot bear it, and that you had much rather see your Clergy imitate you in this, than hear them com∣mend you for it. I will therefore rather study from your Ex∣ample, how to do my own Duty, than publish to the World how you do yours.
That God would still continue your good Lordship as great a Blessing as you are an Honour to our Church, and give you a sure but late enjoyment of those celestial Blessings to which your Soul, by its devout Affections, and indefatigable Labours still aspires, is the continual Prayer of,
My LORD,
