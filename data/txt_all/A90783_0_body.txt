SIR,
MY duty (that moves alwaies to your presence, as the flame to heaven) is now more imboldned, because in the present eruption of Licentious Pamphlets, I conceive it seasonable to publish a modest worke, and necessary to intitle it to inviolable protection. Humbly therefore I con∣secrate to your Highnesse Pliny's Panegyricke, which hath lived many Ages with constant appro∣bation in his Dialect, and even in my rude expres∣sions (being cherished with your gracious smile) may have the honour to out-live all those abor∣tives

of the Presse, that (like their compeeres the vipers) are curst into fruitfulnesse.
Such as his Booke, such was the Author, uni∣versally approved of; for what merit, appeares by his advancement in those times when merit onely was preferr'd, his prudence, erudition, and integri∣ty of life advancing him to the Consulship of Rome, and yet higher, to the impartiall estimation of his Prince, for whose favours gratefull Pliny to this day payes tribute: For now when Trajan's Annals lye in fragments, when those imperiall Statues and Triumphall Arches, that should have immortali∣zed him, have confessed their owne mortality; be∣hold (in this Panegyricke) that best of Caesars from his Ashes reascends his Throne, where he still go∣vernes the world, as an example.
But, Sir, you have (and long may you have) a living example, the absolute paterne of all virtues, His Sacred Majestie, whose Heroicall and Divine Principles we know are written in your heart, because we read them in your actions. From hence flowes your particular regard to the deserving, from hence your generall affability, and (which in your Spring of yeares we behold with greatest admira∣tion) your love to Iustice equalls your love to Men; and both these Affections are steered by Iudgement, great as your Birth and Spirit.
What fitter wish can I make to so much good∣nesse, then that of the Romane Senate to their Em∣perours? May you beEutropius. Ʋsque ad nostrā aetatem non ali∣ter in Senatu Principibus ac∣clametur, nisi foelicior Au∣gusto, melior Trajano. happier then Augustus, better then Trajan: to whom you are now so just a Paral∣lel, that I present his Character as a marke of your owne height in honour; whereon if your High∣nesse please sometimes to cast your eye, you may discerne how you out-grow him in those perfecti∣ons, vvhich render you the Modell of your Excel∣lent Parents, and the joy of all their Loyall Sub∣jects; among the faithfullest whereof, as my study, so my hope is ever to be number'd:
SIR,
