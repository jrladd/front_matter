SIR,
THE Great Men, whom I have the Honor to pre∣sent to your Majesty, are the Hero's of these Famous Crusades, who have seven several times armed all Europe, for the Conquest of the Holy Land. And possibly it may not be displeasing to your Ma∣jesty, to see the most valiant Princes of their times, and above all the Princes of your August, Consanguinity, whom the Glory which they have acquired by a thousand Gallant Actions, hath rendred Immortal. It is true, that their Arms have not had all that happy Success, which they seemed to promise; and that those of so many Barbarous Na∣tions, who united against them, have at last remained Victorious. But, Sir, after that which all the Earth hath seen with astonishment in this last Champaign, one may say, That there hath not been for this four hun∣dred years and upwards, above one single Hero, who is to be found in the Person of your Majesty, who hath been able to atchieve so great and Glorious an enterprise, and to triumph so gloriously over so many Ene∣mies.
And in truth all the Forces of the Emperor, the King of Spain, the greatest part of the Circles of the Empire, and all those of the Hol∣landers, both by Sea and Land, are something more formidable than those of the Egyptians, the Arabians, the Persians, and the Turks, and nevertheless your Majesty Commanding either your self in Person, or causing your Orders to be executed by your Lieutenants, hath van∣quished and dissipated them all; you only, without the assistance of your Allies, who seemed as if they had taken Arms, only to be, with more Pomp and Ceremony, the spectators of your Victories.

This Wonder, Sir, is the most surprizing effect of a consummated Pru∣dence, and an Heroick Courage, accompanied with a Fortune always invincible, which may justly acquire you the most Glorious Surnames of your Predecessors, which your Majesty hath long since Merited by the Conquests of the preceding Campaigns, and by so many Royal Actions, as have in all things rendred the incomparable greatness of your Soul most eminently conspicuous to the whole Earth.
After this can it be doubted, but that if Lewis the Great had reign∣ed in the Ages of these Crusades, or if the Age of the Crusades had been retarded, till the Raign of Lewis the Great, we should have seen at this Day, the Empire of Jesus Christ re-established in the Holy Land, without having any need of the other Christian Princes to min∣gle their Arms with his, otherwise than to celebrate his Triumphs?
As for my self, who have been always obliged to your Majesty, by an inviolable Tye, both of my Duty and my Choice, and who have the Ho∣nour to be particularly your Creature, by the effects of your Royal Bounty, I am confident to say, that I should make more noise than all the rest, in such an agreeable Concert. I hope also that I shall give some proofs to posterity, that I have the Idea of your Majesty, so im∣printed in my Heart and Soul, that I shall always borrow some Lines from it, whether it be in the painting of my Hero's, who can never ap∣pear so great, as when they come to be observed to have the good For∣tune to resemble your Majesty, or in recounting their admirable Actions, in such places as they seem to imitate, though much short of them, the Greatness of yours.
This Testimony, Sir, of my Zeal for your Majestie's Glory, is no more than Truth, for so great a King; and tho' possibly it may be too little for so good a Master, yet since, in the condition wherein the Divine Providence hath placed me, it is all that I can do, to let the whole World understand, with how much Ardor, Submission and Veneration, I am,
SIR,
