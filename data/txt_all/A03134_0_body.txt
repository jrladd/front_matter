Sir, yow having married the widdowe of my decea∣sed vncle, Mr: Jerome Heydon marchant of London: I am tyed by an obligation of loue, to shewe you al dutifull respect, and for yours, and my Aunts many favours J have made choise to dedicate vnto your selfe, these parti∣culars, touching the seige of Mastricht, & some remarkeable things hapned this last yeres service in the Lowe Countries. And though they be not so well done, as I could wishe they were, because some things maye be forgotten, and others which came not to my knowledge; yet so farre, as my in∣telligence served, and being an eye-witnesse in the most of them: J hope they will carrye more truth along vvith them, then Eloquence: for truth, and bluntnesse becomes a Souldier best. Here then (worthy Sr:) you shall see everie Nation (as so many rivers runing into the mayne) endevou∣ring, and striving to doe the State, and Land service, whome wee serve. One principall motive, vvhich perswaded mee to vndertake this labour, and to putt it out to the viewe of the vvorld was this. Harmon Hugo a Iesuite wrote well in the

praise, and Conduct of the deceased Marques Spinola (who deserved well, and was one of the best Generalls that ever the King of Spayne had in his Lowe Cuntrie warrs) concer∣ning the blocking vp of Breda: It is as free for mee, being a protestant and a Souldier, to write some thing (without flatterie) as a remembrance to posteritie, in the honor & cō∣mendations of our Generalissimo the Prince of Orange. & if hee pararells, these two great Generalls of our age together, in∣deed, I must tell the Iesuite this, in a Souldiers account a towne, or a citie gayned by the sword, and Approches is more honorable (witnes the seige of the Bosch, & Mastricht) then to block it vp, and to starue yt out, which is a langui∣shing death. On the contrarie side, because hee spake well of our nation, & gives them their due: I will likewise speake the truth, that wee mett with a brave Gouvernour, the Ba∣ron of Leyde, and a daring Ennemie, which disputed every patch of ground with vs, and yeelded not, till the foundati∣on, and Bowells of the vvall of Mastricht were rent assunder. To concludel, that which I have collected, the severall ser∣vices acted, the passages, and remarkeable things to be ob∣served, I leave to your wise, & the judicious Readers Con∣sideration, which I hope wilbe acceptable vnto you, & rest.
