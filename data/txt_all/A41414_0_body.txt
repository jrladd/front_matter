SIR,
IT might argue I did acquiesce too much to flesh and bloud, should I dedicate this book to any of my Kindred: and least it seeme presumption in me to con∣secrate
 it unto you; I must beseech you to believe 'tis none of mine: You know I have a gallant Master for this self-de∣niall, who said, His Doctrine was not His: which yet none could lay claime unto besides his sacred self. How justly then may I professe this book is not mine own? being all of it (upon the matter) either Holy Churches Prayers, or Holy Text, or Holy Fa∣thers Expositions on the same? And (as such) it is rather your Defence, than any waies in need of your Protecti∣on: Now least you should reply, I give it then unjustly as mine own to you, and more unjustly begg your Patronage thereof, as of a stollen Treasure; I must confesse it is indeed a pious theft, but such an one, as the thiefe may take at noone day from the Coffers of the
 Church without a Sacrifice, without a blush, though all the world were lookers on; and such, as you may safe∣ly both receive, and Patronize, with as small remorse, as men doe Hony brought unto the Hives, which openly the Bees have stollen from the melliflu∣ous flowers of other mens Gardens, as I have done the sweet Connexion that I found between the Churches Prayers, and Text of Holy Writ; when I as∣say to shew the self-same Spirit anni∣mates them all, and makes them speak one sence in diverse Languages or Dia∣lects.
And this sympathy between the parts of Holy Churches service is what I here present to you, as my observation, rather than my worke, for had it not been there before, I could not now
 have found it out, if yet I may not rather feare I loose it, when I look to find it, by making it appeare lesse than it is, for want of being able to shew it to the full. But I will not tell you by how many titles I in∣title this to you, least I force the Lil∣lyes of your modestie, to change com∣plexion with the Roses of your other Virtues, or least I seeme to flatter you, who are not to be flattered: and therefore I shall rather silence my ob∣ligations to you, than betray the se∣crets of your bounties, which your left cannot accuse your right hand of, although they both are stealing mer∣rit, whilst they give their Almes in ample manner, unknown to one ano∣ther, as he well advised, who knew the best way how to make benevolences
 meritorious; nor shall I boast your more than ordinary favours showred upon me other waies, as tyes to make me give you these my labours: ab∣stracting therefore from all self-re∣lation, and looking onely on the na∣ture of this booke, I find not any man more fit to Patronize it, than your selfe, because as it associates all the CHRISTIANS of the uni∣verse into one SODALITIE, so you, that are Eminent in making every man your owne, will be the greatest help to this Association, which I have founded on the Word of God, and Prayers of Holy Church; two sub∣jects that I know not any one more versed in than you, witnesse the ex∣cellent store of both, which your Missive and your Misscelania doe afford;
 wherein you shew your selfe not one∣ly to have the Scripture lodg'd within your heart, but even the genuine sense thereof ingrafted in your understand∣ing, as appears by your admirable Explications of the Texts, and Ap∣plications of them to the purpose that you cite them for, which as it was a motive for me to imitate you in, so in justice it obligeth me to consecrate this book to you, whose whole designe is either Notion, or the use of the Ho∣ly Text.
Againe, Sir, I looke upon you as a man designed to some thing more than yet the World is privie to, for your Pauline Conversion, makes me think you are the Vessell of Electi∣on which our Nation may one day hope to see, as overflowing as I know
 you are now full of Eminent Perfecti∣ons, this I professe I doe not mind you of, to puffe you up with self-conceit, (for of your self it is with you as with the rest of men, made up of nothing but corruption and infirmity) but to humble you rather, to see how much of Grace doth shine upon the dunghill of Humane Nature, while your Conversion from infidelity workes in you an aversion from all singularity, and renders you a man partiall to none, beneficiall to all that know you, even unto those that are above you to, who fare the bet∣ter for your virtues, while their Temporalls are raised from the spiri∣tuall foundations you have laid. Thus from the Court unto the Cart, from the Prince unto, the Begger God
 hath adapted you to all his Holy Ends; and therefore I that aime at Una∣nimity in this Sodality, at Uni∣ty in our Community, (let me attest for this the Motto of my Book Saint Pauls words to the Romanes, CHAP. 15. Vers. 6.) have made a right addresse; when I petition you to Patronize my Labours in aggre∣gating this SODALITIE, who are one man most acceptable to all for your Equality, or rather Equani∣mity to every one; as if you were Omnibus omnia factus. And seriously, Sir, I doe honour you most for the impartiality of your affecti∣ons, for that you are not biassed so as to runne one way, but can (and doe) plie unto the mark of loving all in him, whom all must love,
 which way soever you are throwne, upon request of this or that body, Rich or Poore, Clarke or Lay-man, Secular or Regular Priest; so much, that I believe, if I had failed of this my duty in choosing you for Pa∣tron of my Book, I had been chidden for mistaking in my choyce of him, whom all men would have voted for, as well as I, the design of this SO∣DALITY, and your simpathie to that design considered. Please therefore I beseech you, Sir, to Pa∣tronize these labours of your humble Servant, who am all your own; and who beg your Patronage of this first Tome for one reason more than I have heer expressed, or then is known, as yet, to any but my self, which you will well approve of, when you see
 to whom the next Tome shall bee consecrated, as this is now to you by him that resteth,
Honourable Sir,
