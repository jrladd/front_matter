May it please your Grace,
THough the Presumption I might
have been guilty of in this
Dedication, is somewhat excu∣sed
in your Graces Permission;
yet the meanness of this Trifle,
infuses a secret shame into me,
when I consider how ill a Present I have made to
a Person of such eminent Merit and Grandeur,
whose obliging, and not to be exampled Clemency,
induces him to Patronize a Piece that rather di∣minishes,
than brings the least addition to his
Fame. Had it been an Heroick Poem, I might
have open'd my eyes with greater assurance, and

cherish'd my ambitious thoughts with the resoluti∣on
of honouring some happy Heroe with your
Graces illustrious Character, and so under pre∣tence
of a slender merit springing from the Work,
have insinuated my self into your Favour. But
whereas other Authors are happy in this particu∣lar,
how little have I to boast of, when all I can say
in my defence, is, That its only good Fortune was,
in being the Subject of the Courts diversion, where
their Noble Clemency and Good Nature were
extremely requisite, in covering its defects from
the too Censorious; His Majesty, according to
His accustomed Royal and Excellent Temper,
was pleas'd to descend so far, as to give it a par∣ticular
Applause, which was seconded by your
Grace, little considering, my Lord, the Pride a
young Author might be infected with, in seeing his
Play honour'd with so dignified an Approbation.
But when I had the honour to wait upon you, and
saw shining in all your Actions the glorious Beams
of Humility, Courtesie, true Honour and Virtue,
Perfections seldom seen in Great Men, 'tis impos∣sible
for me to decipher my thoughts, nor had I
power to utter them; for my Minds surprize ad∣ded
to the imperfection of my Speech, though I

had leisure to consider how despicable a thing is
Pride, when supprest by the pious Inclinations of
a generous Virtue. Pardon me, my Lord, if the
indefatigable Zeal I owe your Grace, makes me
wander from the nicer Rules of Dedication;
And I beseech you believe, that as to Admire you
I never can enough, so to Flatter you, is far be∣yond
my power, you being far above it; I have
more reason to beg your Pardon for this Tres∣pass,
than to incur your Anger for another De∣fault:
A Buffoon, though he may be often stil'd
the sport and diversion of Princes, would very
ill become the Name of their Companion. And
so this Play, though it had the Fortune to please
you as Spectator, must needs blush at its insuffici∣ency,
being receiv'd as a Bosome Friend. Confes∣sion
(my Lord) makes an abatement of the
Crime, and to make it wholly pardonable, the rest
must be impos'd upon your Graces Clemency that
authoriz'd my Boldness; the Clemency that drew
me from a melancholy Retirement, where Content
and I were often quarrelling about a slender For∣tune,
to visit the blissful Habitation of Virtue
and Grandeur. Birds sing most sweetly that sit
in the Sun-beams; and 'tis, I confess, the Natu∣ral

Ambition of most Poets, to shelter themselves
under the Wings of Nobility, Encouragement
adding more sweetness to their Pens, and more
vivacity to their Fancy: But to study to deserve
the blessing of your Favour, shall be ever the
great and sole Ambition of,
MY LORD,
