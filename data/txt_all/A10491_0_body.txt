My Lord:
THere is more reason for the Dedication of this Sermon to your Lordship, then for the Impression of it. Your Acceptance of me to be yours, before you had any other of my Qua∣lity: The timely fruit of your fauour, in my Aduancement vnto that For∣tune, by which J subsist: My At∣tendance vpon your Employments, and Seruices, at this present: And whatsoeuer is any way eminent either in my Estate, or Name, J am rea∣dy to ascribe it to your Lordship, from
whence J haue receiued it. For the printing of this Booke, I can say lit∣tle. Jt is not any greedy Appetite of Life, wherein it can take comfort, but rather the contrary, wherewith euery thing is naturally touched, Feare of Death and Obliuion. And yet if it be proper to any Discourses, those of this nature are fittest to sur∣uiue the first Birth, because they con∣teine the vncorruptible seed which dieth not. Besides, Prin∣ted Sermons haue this priuiledge a∣boue Vocall Sermons onely, that they may be instant in season, and out of season. J pray God to prosper your Lordships Person, and Affaires.
