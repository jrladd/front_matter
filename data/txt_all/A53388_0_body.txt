GREAT SIR,
I Have here undertaken to draw the Picture of a Person that once was invested with the Stile, Title, and Dignity of a King, and certainly he might have been the great∣est in his time, could he but have complied with the ends of his great Office in this Nation, to which he was admitted, and with the observation of the Laws of the Realm, to which he was solemnly Sworn, according to the Customs and Constitutions thereof at his Coronation. I did never in my whoLe life take him to be the Wisest of Men; nor did I believe him to be so much behind-hand in Under∣standing, but that he must needs know, That as Govern∣ment was Originally instituted by the Great God himself, and this or that Form of it, chosen and submitted to by Men, for the Peace, Happiness and Security of those who

are Governed, and not for the private Interest and perso∣nal Greatness of them that Rule; so that Government hath been always esteemed the best, where Supream Ma∣gistrates have been invested with the Power and Preroga∣tives that might capacitate them not only to preserve the People from Violence and Oppression, but to promote their Prosperity, and yet where nothing was to belong to them by the Rules of the Constitution, that might enable them to Injure and Oppress them.
This unhappy Prince, was a long stander by in his Bro∣ther's Reign; from the Year 1660, to 1685; and Experience and the Informations of wise Men, without all doubt, taught him, That it had been the Glory of England above other Nations and Countries where his Brother and he had Travelled, that its King hath had all Intrusted with him that was necessary for the advancing the welfare of the People, or for his own Protection in the discharge of his Office and support of his Dignity and Grandure, and withal stood so limited and restrained by the Fun∣damental terms of the Constitution, that without the vio∣lation of his own Oath, as well as the Rules and Measures of the Government, he could do them no hurt, nor exer∣cise any act of Authority, but through the Administration of such hands as stood obnoxious to be Punished in case they Transgressed: So that according to the true Primi∣tive frame of the Government, the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Rights and Privileges of the Subject were so far from justling one another, that the Immunities re∣served unto the People, tended to render the King Honou∣rable and Great; and the Prerogatives settled on the King, were in order to the Subjects Protection and Safety.

Notwithstanding all this, it is well known to your Most Excellent Majesty, that in the two last Reigns there was a dismal and an unaccountable alteration of the Govern∣ment attempted by this Prince and his Popish Accomplices, and the most excellent Monarchy endeavoured to be changed into an absolute French Tyranny: For tho our Religion and Liberties were fenced and hedged about by as many Laws as the Wisdom of Men could devise for our Preservation, from Popery and Arbitrary Power; yet our Religion was in those unaccountable Reigns Under∣mined by Popish Counsels, and our Privileges ravished from us by the Fraud and Violence of the two last Kings, who were in a continued Conspiracy against the Prote∣stant Religion, and the Rights of the People of England, of which your Majesty may take a full Account in the following Memorial.
I must confess to Your Majesty, that to discant on the Misfortunes of a Person that is fallen from so high a Dig∣nity, and is reduced to a State that is next to Death, is neither a thing that I coveted or desig'nd, tho I was a great Sufferer by him both in his Brother's and his Reign; but the Insolency of his wicked Conspirators that are here a∣mong us, hath so provoked me, that I cannot in point of Duty that I owe to God and Your Majesty, forbear letting the Nation know what we must trust to if ever that Man should return again and Reign over us.
This present Conspiracy against Your Majesty and Go∣vernment, hath not only provoked me to publish the Arts and Methods of the late King, used for the destruction of our Laws, Liberties and Religion, in conjunction with the Popish Party, but it hath encouraged me to Dedicate

the same to your Royal Name and Patronage, and to no other, because I am well assured, it will not only justifie the truth of the Popish Plot, for the discovery of which I have undergone a fierce Fiery Tryal, out of which I was de∣livered by Your Majesties coming to Save us, when we were even upon the brink of Ruin and Destruction; the sense of which hath created in me an undelible Love and Loyalty to Your Majesty and Government; and I question not, but that Your Majesty will Pardon the Human Frailties that may appear in this Memorial in the manner of my expres∣sing the Truths therein Contained.
The Villainous Party, against whom I now Write, have used many Arts and ways to traduce your Majesty and Government, meerly because you promote the Grandure of your People, and the Ease and Welfare of your Sub∣jects, rather than intrench in the least upon any of their Immunities and Privileges; some of whom would be thought to be good Protestants; but their late Conspiracy to Assassinate Your Majesty, shews them to be very Tray∣tors and Rebels to your Majesty and Government; and it proves that Party to be obstinately restless, and never be brought to Reason by Mercy and Clemency. How little therefore these Criminals will deserve from Your Majesty, the World will better judge, if they will but consider how Graciously Your Majesty hath dealt with them, ever since Your happy Accession to the Impe∣rial Crown of this Realm, to the very day that their wicked Purposes were discovered to Your Majesty. I have seen some of the very same Spirit, caressed by some that were about You, whist your real hearty Friends were Slighted and Aban∣doned. Nay, I shall be so plain to say with truth, that

your Majesty hazarded the Hearts and Affections of your best Subjects, and much of your Royal Honour, in con∣niving at the Carriages of these Men, though with frustra∣tion, to win and oblige, if possible, these everlasting holy Cut-throats.
But Sir, what Arguments of Clemency and Grace can persuade such Men to be true to your Majesty, their Right∣ful and Lawful King, maintaining the Laws and Liber∣ties of your Subjects, since they profess an Allegiance out of Conscience to a contrary Sovereign, who destroy'd our Laws and Liberties, and made them sharers in his many Designs and Conspiracies against us? Or how can your Majesty expect Truth and Sincerity from these Conspira∣tors, where Treason and Lies are Virtues and Merits? You have in this Tract many Tragical Instances within fresh Memory of their Wicked Purposes and Designs; look back but to the beginning of your Majesties Reign, since which time your Majesty cannot but remember how many Proofs they have given out of their own Mouths of their more than Villainous Disaffection to your Majesty and Government, and Trayterous Intentions against your Royal Person, both at Home and Abroad, nay, before your happy Accession to the Throne. I may, without offence to your Majesty, take notice to you of your being abandoned by King Charles, in Compliance with the French King, at the Insti∣gation of the then Duke of York, and his Popish Adherents; and not only so, but your Ruin and Destruction, when you only had the Title of Prince of Orange, was designed by the Popish Party; my Affection and Respects to you then, though wholly a Stranger to your Person, made me then discover the Conspiracy against you, but none of the

Council took any notice of what related to your Self, but Prince Rupert and the Earl of Arlington, and another con∣siderable Peer, who, I suppose, did transmit the same to you when in Holland.
But blessed be God your Majesty as a Monument of the Mercies of the most High, is once more delivered out of their Hands, and in your Deliverance we that have Es∣poused you are delivered; and we question not but you will remember to distinguish between those that have testi∣fied their Sincere Loyalty to your Majesty, and those that have openly appeared Traytors to your Royal Person and Government, and question not, Great Sir, but that God who hath now so Miraculously delivered you, and in whose hand are the Hearts of all Kings and Princes, will fully Convince your Majesty of all the unworthy Prin∣ciples of your secret Enemies, and of my Integrity too, how strange soever they have endeavour'd to represent me to your Majesty; till then, with all Patience and Humility, I shall commend my Cause to the All-seeing Judge, with a Resolution to persevere through his Assistance in my Truth, Integrity and Loyalty, against all Discouragements, or Ter∣rors, or Neglects, or Blandishments either, to my last gasp.
What Peace can these Brutes have in their Souls and Consciences, that do surrender their Liberties and Religi∣on to the Mercy of a Person that would have inslaved them, and being through the Mercy of God to us, driven out from these Kingdoms for his Tyranny, he nei∣ther can nor will he own them, if he were to return. It is strange to any thinking Man, that of these Conspirators, who profess the Protestant Religion, that they should not consider the whole Series or Course of Life of that preten∣ded

King, for whom they venture Body and Soul, hath been a continued Conspiracy against them and their Re∣ligion. Why should they not sit down and consider his Contriving the Burning of London; his instigating a Con∣federacy with France, and two ungodly Wars with Hol∣land; his fomenting the Popish Plot, and contriving the Murther of Justice Godfrey, to stifle it; his forging of Trea∣son against Protestants, and suborning Witnesses to swear the Patriots of our Religion and Liberties, out of their Lives; his hiring execrable Villains to Assassinate and Murther the Great Earl of Essex, and causing several others to be clan∣destinely Murthered in hopes to conceal it; his advising and procuring the Prorogation and Dissolution of Parliaments, in order to prevent inquiry into his Crimes, so that he might es∣cape the Justice of the Nation? Why should not these Prote∣stant Professors remember his Poysoning the King his Bro∣ther, in order to his Invading the Throne; his Murdering Algernoon Sydney Esq upon the Deposition of one scanda∣lous Witness, and the cutting off the late Loyal and Brave Lord Russel, and Murdering him for Crimes alledged against him, in reference to which, if all had been Truth which was sworn against him, yet there was nothing that according to Law could have reached his Life?
Give me leave, Great Sir, to acquaint your Majesty, that none murmured more against the Proceedings of the late King than the Protestant Jacobites did: I can remem∣ber how confounded they were when he began his Reign, with a bare-fac'd avowing himself of the Romish Religion, and calling into the Nation a multitude of Priests and Je∣suits, and empowered them to Exercise their Idolatries: Nay, who were so much concern'd as some of these Men,

and in my own hearing, have owned that he was ill ad∣vised to trample upon those Laws which concern our Pro∣perty, seeing that by two Proclamations, whereof the one required the Collecting of the Customs, and the other, the continuing the Excise, which was to expire at King Charles's Death; he violently, and against all the Laws of the Land, broke in upon the Estates of many of the Peo∣ple of England; and they did own that the seven or eight suborn'd and forsworn Judges, that countenanc'd him in doing so vile a Thing ought to have been hanged; and they have often said, that if he proceeded thus he would soon bring the Kingdom about his Ears, and he must take it for his pains: How can these Men look Mankind in the Face, who have been in a barbarous Conspiracy, for the restoring of a King that had thus acted in oppressing his People, and for the Murdering of your Majesties Person, that had delivered the Nation from these Oppressions?
When I reflect upon the Reign of that late King, I can∣not but be filled with the greatest Horror, to think that there should be a number of Men left in England, that should so much as attempt his Restoration, when they well knew that he had precluded his Subjects of all hopes of Redress in Westminster-Hall, and deprived us of all Suc∣cour where our Ancestors found it. I thought that all Men would have joined with your Majesty to have decla∣red the late King James a Tyrant, Traytor and Murderer, and all that did adhere to him should have been treated as Banditti and Freebooters, and not as Gentlemen and Eng∣lish Men; but instead of this, that in the compass of seven Years, behold two or three Conspiracies against your Majesties Person and Government, detected and proved,

and yet these People will scarce so much as blush at the self-contradicting Carriage of themselves and Party.
Some of these Protestant Jacobites have been at St. Ger∣mains, and then they must Experience the late King's usage of his Protestant Friends there; and if a certain Writer may be depended upon, their usage is hard and severe; first he denied them a Protestant Chappel and Chaplain; nay, if a Protestant be any thing zealous for his Religion, they want not Irish Papists to swear a Plot upon them, and so they are confined notwithstanding their Quality, and the signal Services performed for their pretended King. Many Instances might be given of this nature; and a reasonable Man might have judged that the many Instances of those Slights and Contempts that have been put upon them, should have convinced them of the Folly and Madness of any of those that pretend to the Protestant Religion and Church of England, who should Espouse the Cause of a Man that hates their Religion and Liberties. Can they think that the present Misfortunes that the late King James lies under, would, if he should be re-invested with Power, frighten him to alter his Measures and Resoluti∣ons of invading our Laws and Liberties for time to come, seeing, that neither the abandoning of Wives, Children and Estates, nor the hazarding, nay, loss of Life in his Service, can render him just and favourable to those Pro∣testants, who have made a Sacrifice of all these things to follow him, and yet that these Men should be found in so Villanous a Conspiracy, to Murder him that delivered the Nation? What Tongue can speak for such brutish and sensless Wretches, I must leave to the Judgments of wiser Men than my self. And what can they expect from

a Man whose Father's Misfortunes, his Brothers Exile, wherein he himself was a sharer, have not wrought a Re∣formation in him? Can we expect that ever he will be more cautious of violating our Laws, intrenching upon our Liberties, or subverting our Religion; or that ever he will be made more pliable? For if he denies Men that have followed him into France, the Exercise of their Reli∣gion, what hopes have they of obtaining and enjoying it, whenever he shall return? Nay, what then must your Majesties Protestant Subjects expect, who have renounced him, and associated to defend your Majesty, as our Law∣ful and Rightful King, against this pretended King and all his Wicked and Trayterous Adherents?
But Sir, give me leave a little further to plead with your Majesty concerning these People, that certainly ne∣ver give themselves leisure to think; I am sure no Man in his right Wits but must judge it the highest degree of Stupidity and Folly, that these very Men should expect good Terms from a Person who doth not only treat his Protestant Adherents very ill, who have followed him in his Misfortunes, but also whose Religion lays him under the necessity of using them thus. What Obligations did our Church lay upon him when he was a Subject? Did she not, like a Prostitute, save him from being Prosecu∣ted for the Popish Plot, and from being Excluded from the Succession to the Crown? Who were so Hot in that point on his behalf as the then Prelates in the House of Peers, and afterwards from being driven out of the King∣dom, by the late Duke of Monmouth? yet all those Obli∣gations were of no more value with him than his Coro∣nation-Oath, which he violated without the least regret,

and spared not to invade the Protestant Religion in gene∣ral, but the Liberties of the Church of England in par∣ticular.
What wicked Traytors are these wretched Men, that shall assist the Popish Party in their attempts to pervert the Church, and to bring that about in effect which even to mention, makes every Loyal Subject of your Majesties to tremble? For certainly had these Conspirators been all of them avowed Papists, your Majesties Person and Go∣vernment had not been in that danger; but some of them that have undertaken this Horrid Design, are such as lye under no Temptations of Religion; Men thought to be secure; that these, now the Mystery of Iniquity is re∣vealed, are found Men obliged by all the Sacred Ties of Malice and Ambition, to assist in the advancing your Ma∣jesties Ruin, and the Ruin of the three Kingdoms; and much better qualified than others, under the Name of Good Church of England Men; nay, Preachers of Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance will not be shut out of this Hellish Conspiracy for Wranglers, but will have a hand against your Majesty's Person, rather than so E∣minent a piece of Service shall go unperfected. Give me leave therefore Sir, with the greatest Duty and Submissi∣on, to observe to your most Excellent Majesty the Excel∣lency of that Religion they would subvert, by shewing the Vileness of that they would introduce, and the happy Go∣vernment they would destroy in the attempt they have made upon your Majesty's Person.
These Conspirators that say they are Protestants, cannot but own that we are exceeding happy in relation to our Religion, since by your Majesty's happy Accession to the

Throne; that we are once more freed from the Romish Yoke, which so great a part of Europe do yet draw and la∣bour under; that Popery is such a thing as cannot but for want of a Word to express it, be called Religion; nor is it to be mentioned with that Civility which is other∣wise decent to be used in speaking of Differences of Hu∣mane Opinion about Divine Matters; were it open Ju∣daism, or plain Turcism, or honest Paganism; there is yet a certain Bonafides in the most extravagant Belief, and the Sincerity of an Erroneous Profession may render it more pardonable: But this Popery is a Compound of all the three, an Extract of whatsoever is most Ridiculous and Impious in them, incorporated with more peculiar Absur∣dities of its own, in which those were deficient, and all this deliberately contrived, and knowingly carried on by the Rascally and Villainous Clergy, under the Name of Chri∣stianity. The Wisdom of this fifth Religion in this last and most Insolent Attempt upon the Credulity and Con∣spiracy against the Liberty of Mankind, seems to all Un∣derstanding Men, principally to have consisted in their owning the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and the Rule of Faith and Manners; but wickedly prohibiting at the same time their common Use, or the Reading of them by those of their Communion, there being no bet∣ter or more rational way to frustrate the very design of our Lord Jesus Christ, (who first planted by the miracu∣lous Power and extraordinary Gifts of the Holy-Ghost) than to forbid the use of them in such a Language as the People could understand; for having the Scripture, which by all Christians are avowed to be of Divine Authority, but appointing it to remain in such hands as were intru∣sted

to undertake and carry on their holy Cheat, they had the Opportunity to vitiate, suppress, or interpret, to their own advantage, for the support of their Villainous Priestcraft, those admirable Evidences, by which the com∣mon People hold their Salvation; and they having by this Fraud gained their Point, there was from that time nothing so monstrous to Reason, and so abhorring from Morality, or so contrary to Scripture, which they might not in prudence venture on. The Idolatry of Adoring and praying to Saints and Angels, and worshipping Pictures, Ima∣ges, and incredible Miracles, and palpable Fables, to promote that Veneration. The whole Liturgy and Worship of the blessed Virgin, the saying of Pater Nosters and Creeds, the Honour of Saints and Ave-Maries too, not to her Ho∣nour, but of others. The Publick Service, which they can spare to God among, so many Competitors in anun∣known Tongue, and intangled with such Vestments, Con∣secrations, Exorcisms, Whisperings, Sprinklings, Censings, and Phantastical Rites, Gesticulations and Removals, so unbecoming a Christian Office, that it represents rather the Pranks and Ceremonies of a Jugler or a Conjurer: The refusal of the Cup to the Laity, the necessity of the Priests' Intention to make any of their Sacraments effe∣ctual, debarring of their Clergy from Marriage, Inter∣dicting of Meats, Auricular Confession, and Absolution, as with them Practised; Penances, Pilgrimages, Purga∣tory. But above all, their other Cheats and Rogueries, in the Villainous Solecism of Transubstantiation, whereby that Glorified Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which at the same time they allow to be in Heaven, is Sold again and Crucified daily upon all the Altars of their Commu∣nion;

for God indeed may now and then do a Miracle, but a Rascally Priest of their Synagogue can, it seems, work in one moment a thousand Impossibilities; and this by a new and Anti-scriptural Belief, compiled of Terrors to the Phancy, Contradictions to Sense, and Impositions on the Understanding. The Laity of their Communion have turned Tenants for their Souls, and in Consequence Tri∣butaries for their Estates, to an abominable nonsensical Priesthood.
But I confess my self under great Obligation to do their Synagogue right, and I do humbly acknowledge to your Majesty, that out of an equitable and vasble Consideration and Recompence of such a religious and faithful Servitude, the Priests have quitted and dischar∣ged the People of all other Services and Dependence, and given them full and perfect liberty from all Duty to God or Man, insomuch that those of the Clergy, who have been more learned, and the managers and directors of their Consciences, have so well instructed them in all the most villainous Arts of circumventing their Neigh∣bours, and of making a Jest of Heaven; that were their Disciples as apt as their Spiritual School-masters, there would for some Ages since have been a Period put to all true Piety, and common Honesty, and no other Endow∣ments remaining with them, but authorised Hypocrisy, Licentiousness and Knavery, had not the natural Worth of the better sort, and the good Simplicity of the meaner, in a very great measure preserved them; for truly nothing but an extraordinary Temper of Soul and that too assist∣ed by the Divine Influences of the Grace and Spirit of God could possibly restrain those within any Terms, or

bounds, or laws of common Humanity, who at the same time receive the Doctrin of their Casuists as the Oracles of God, and own the Authority of the Grand Impostor at Rome to be of Divine Right, as it is by him claimed and exercised. This Man of Sin by his pretended Indulgencies says, That he delivers the Souls of those that are of his Communion, out of the pains of the other World: So that what Man is he that believes that Doctrin, that would not please his vicious Appetite, that hath so good a Security? He, by his Dispensing Power annuls Contracts between Man and Man; dissolves Oaths between Princes, and of Princes with their Subjects, and gives Allowance in Cases which God and Nature prohibits. This Impostor and deceiver of the the Sons of Men, as a Clerk of the Ecclesiastical Market, hath set a Rate upon all Crimes, the more villanous they are, and the deeper their dye, and abominable, the better Commodities, and the Votaries advance in the Price as for greater Rarities: So that the worse they are in their Morals, the better Customers they are to a lewd Priest; just as if God had publish'd his holy Commandments on purpose to erect an Office for the Conscience-mongers of that cursed Synagogue. And thus that Strumpet enlar∣geth her Borders, encreaseth in her Numbers, just as the Pa∣gan Interest did the City of Rome, by opening a Sanctu∣ary to all Malefactors. And why should it not be so, if the Papal Power be of such virtue and extent as is by that Jugler of Rome so violently challenged? He calls him∣self the Ruler of Angels, Purgatory, and Hell, and saith, That his Tribunal and God's are all one; and hath proud∣ly boasted, that all that God can do, he can do, and what he doth is as God, not as Man: That he is the uni∣versal

Head of the Church; the sole Interpreter of Scrip∣ture; the Judge of Controversies: That he is above Ge∣neral Councils; that his Power is Absolute, and his De∣crees are Infallible: That he can change the nature of things, making what is Just, to be Unjust, and what is Vice, to be Virtue: That all Laws are within the Cabi∣net of his Breast; that he can dispense with the New Testament; that he is the Monarch of the World; and that he can dispose of Kingdoms and Empires as he plea∣ses. Now, if there be one word of Truth in all this, the Stiles they have given him at several times, is not such an extraordinary piece of Courtship as we reckoned, but it would be a piece of Rudeness in Men not to treat him accordingly.
The exercise of his Power and Dominion is in all points suitable to his Claim and Pretence; he antiquates the Precepts of our Great Redeemer, as things only of good Advice, and not Commanded; but makes it Mortal Sin for a Man only to doubt of any part of his Religion, and with all the Insolence imaginable, under pain of eternal Damnation, demands the Obedience and Subjection of all Christian Princes and People to his Papal Authority and Power; the denying of two things so reasonable, as blind Obedience to his Power, and an Implicit Faith to his Doctrin, being the most unpardonable Crimes under his Dispensation. He hath, I confess been of late Years somewhat more retentive than formerly, as to his excel∣lent faculty of Disposing Kingdoms, the thing not having succeeded so well with him in some Instances; but he lays the same Claim still, and hath the same Inclination; and tho Velvet-headed, hath the more itch to be pushing;

but however, in order to any occasion he keeps himself in ure always, by Cursing some Prince or other upon every Maundy Thursday; nor is there any, whether Prince or Nation, that oppose his Usurpations, but are marked out under the notion of Hereticks, for Ruin and Destru∣ction, whensoever he shall give the Signal. That word Heresie, misapplied, hath served the Romish Beast for many Ages to justifie, or rather give a colour for so many Exe∣cutions, Assassinations, Wars, Devastations and Massa∣cres, by which his Faith hath been propagated, of which our Times have not wanted Examples; and more is to be expected for the future, if these Conspirators can but at any time carry their Point; for by how much any thing is more false and unreasonable, so much more Cruelty is requisite to establish it; and to introduce that which is absurd, there must be somewhat done that is Barbarous and Inhuman. But nothing of any Sect in Religion can be more recommended by all these indearing Qualities, than Popery: The Pagans are excusable by their natural Darkness without Revelation: The Jews are tolerable, who see not beyond the Old-Testament: Mahomet was so honest, as to own what he would be at; That he him∣self was the greatest Prophet, and that his was a Reli∣gion of the Sword: So that these were all, as I may say, of another Allegiance; if they were Enemies, yet they were not Traytors: But the Romish Beast avowing Christianity by Profession, doth in Doctrin and Practice renounce it; and presumeing to be the only Catholick, doth presume to prosecute those to death who dare Worship the Author of their Religion, instead of his pretended Vicegerent.

And yet there is nothing more manifest, notwithstand∣ing all his most notorious Forgeries, and falsifications of all Writers, than that the Prelate of Rome was for seve∣ral hundreds of Years an honest Bishop, as other Men are, and never so much as dreamed of the Seven Hills of that Universal Power, which he is now come to: Nay, he was the first that opposed that Pretension. But some of them at last growing Wiser, by foisting a Counterfeit Donati∣on of Constantine, and wresting another Donation from our Saviour, advancing themselves in a Weak, Ignorant and Credulous Age to that Temporal and Spiritual Prin∣cipality that they are now seized of, Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church: Of this I may say to your Majesty; That never was a Bishoprick and a Text of Scripture so Improved by good Management; thus by exercising in the quality of Christ's Vicar the Publick Function under an invisible Prince, the Pope like the Maiors of the Palace, hath set his Master aside, and deli∣vered the power over to a new Line of Papal Succession. But who can, unless wilfully, be ignorant what wretched doings, what Bribery, what Ambitions there are; how long the Church is without a Head upon every Vacancy, till among the filthy Crew of bandying Cardinals, the Holy Ghost hath declared for a Pope of the French or Spanish Faction? Surely Sir, your Majesty will judge it one of the greatest Miracles of the Synagogue of Rome, that it should still continue, and that in all this time the Gates of Heaven should not prevail against it.
Give me leave, Great Sir, to observe to your Majesty, that it is almost inconceivable how Princes can yet suffer a Power so pernicious, and Doctrins so destructive to all

Government, that so great a part of the Land should be alienated and condemned to Pious Uses, as they call it: That so many Thousands of the People that are Clergy, should by remaining unmarried, either frustrate Humane Nature, if they live chastly; or if otherwise, adulterate it, that they should be privileged from all Labour and publick Service and exempt from the power of all Secular Juris∣diction, that they being all bound by strict Oaths and Vows of Obedience to the Pope, should evacuate the Feal∣ty that is due to the Sovereign; nay, that not only the Clergy, but the Laity too, if of the Cursed Communion of that Synagogue, should be obliged at any time to Re∣bel at the Pope's pleasure: And yet how many of the Neigh∣bouring Princes are content, or do choose to Reign up∣on those Conditions, which being so dishonourable and dangerous, surely some great and weighty Reason does cause them to submit to, whether it be out of personal Fear, having heard, perhaps, of several attempts which the blind Obedience of Popish Zealots hath executed against the Princes, or whether aiming at a more absolute and tyrannical Government, they think it still to be the Case of an Usurping Emperor, and an Usurping Bishop; and that this, as other Cheats, is to be managed by Confede∣racy. But Sir, as far as I can apprehend, there is more of Sloth than of Policy on the Princes side in this whole matter, and all that pretence of enslaving Men by the assistance of Religion, is neither more nor less than when the Bramine, by having the first Night of the Bride, as∣sures himself of her Devotion, for the future, and makes her more fit for the Husband.

This Reflection upon the state of our Neighbours, in respect to Religion, doth sufficiently illustrate our Hap∣piness we enjoy by your Majesties Accession to the Crown, of ours: Therefore it spares me the labour of describing it further, than by the rule of Contraries, our Religion and Interest, standing upon all points in a direct Opposition to the above-mentioned Errors, our Doctrin being true to the Principles of the first Institution of Christ, the Ministry being formed upon the Primitive Model, and no Ecclesiastical Power, justling with the Civil, but all concurring in the Common Obedience to the chief Ma∣gistrate: Nor therefore is there any, whether Prince, or Nation, that can at this time with less probability be re∣duced back to the Romish Communion, than the Prote∣stant Interest here in England: For if we respect our Obedi∣ence to God, what appearance is there, that after so dura∣ble and general enlightning of our Minds, with the sacred Truth of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should again put out our own Eyes to wander through the palpa∣ble Darkness of that Gross Superstition? But for as much as many Men are less concern'd for their Interest in Heaven, than on Earth; this seeming the nearer and more certain, also on this account, our Alteration from the Protestant Religion, is the more inconsistent with temporal Advan∣tage, when besides the common ill Examples and Conse∣quences observable Abroad, whereby we might grow wise at the Expence of our Neighbours, we cannot but reflect upon our own Experiments at Home, which would make even Fools docible. The whole Reign of Queen Mary the First, in which the Papists made Fuel of the Protestants; the Excommunicating and Deprivation of

Queen Elizabeth by the Pope, pursued by so many Trea∣sons and Attempts upon her Person, by her own Subjects, and the Invasion of Eighty-Eight by the Spaniard: The two Breves of the Pope, in order to exclude King James the First from the Succession to the Crown, seconded by the Gunpowder-Treason: In the time of K. Charles the first, besides what they contributed to the Civil Wars in Eng∣land, the Rebellion and Horrid Massacre in Ireland, which ended in the Ruin and Destruction of the Person and Go∣vernment of that King: In the time of King Charles the Second we saw several visible Effects of the same Spirit, as the Firing of London, the Popish Design carried on against the Person and Government of that King, not that he was a Protestant; but because he came not up to the Measures of the Jesuits and his Brother the late King James: But as for him, his whole Life was nothing else but a Contrivance or a Plot against our Religion, Laws, and Liberties: But this Horrid Conspiracy against your Majesty's Person and Government, being so happily dis∣covered, we cannot but hope that the Discovery of such a tremendous Villany, will so rivet the Protestant Interest and Religion, that it shall stand so sure, that the Gates of Hell and Rome shall not prevail against it. 'Tis true Sir, before the Discovery of the Popish Plot, in the time of King Charles the Second, many loose People, some also of Note, were perverted to the Church of Rome; but when that Villany was detected, then a Check was put for a time to the Popish Parties making such a number of Con∣verts, till the Priests saw that King Charles the Second did not Prosecute the Discovery of that Conspiracy, he being in every part and particular thereof, but that of his own

Life; then they let loose their Seducers, who were not on∣ly incouraged, but also recompensed for such a piece of Treachery. But when the late King invaded the Crown, then large steps were taken to ruin the People, and to Pox them in their Religion.
Upon your Majesties Landing in the Year 1688, the Keeper of the Prison of the King's-Bench gave me some liberty, and I went amongst some of the most substantial of my Friends, who did inform me under what a Con∣sternation our Great Conspirators were, and how ready they were to have given up all their Ill-gotten Estates, by which they had been enabled to prosecute the wicked Designs of the late King, to subvert our most Excellent Religion; and none of us did question but that they would have been called to an account for all those tray∣terous Devices of theirs; of this, I am sure, they would have given up their All to have saved their Lives: But your Majesty being resolved not to begin your Reign with Blood, was inclined not to make any severe Exam∣ples of these Men; which a thinking Man might judge would lay such an Obligation upon them all of Gratitude and Obedience to your Majesty and Government, nay, these above-named fresh Instances of the Papal Tyranny in Religion, might have been enough to have cautioned the Kingdom from giving them little hopes of being able of being brought to restore King James, who was so bi∣gotted to the Arbitrary Proceedings of the Romish Syna∣gogue; our Noble-men some of them had a great part of Church Lands in their hands, our Clergy-men great Preferments, all which must have gone notwithstanding their Zeal for the Divine Right of Succession and Passive

Obedience and Non-resistence: Therefore the Conside∣ration of Temporal Interest one would have thought might have gone a great way to have engaged them to be true to their own Cause and Quarrel. In a word, a Man that observed the Insolencies of the Popish Party against those Prelates that were committed to the Tower, would have made them for ever to have declared an ever∣lasting War against that Party of Red-letter'd Men, and heartily have come into your Majesties Interest, in order to have secured our Liberties, Properties, and Religion: But to conclude this Head, the Excellency of that Reli∣gion, of which some of the Conspirators had made a Profession, since they were English that had Bodies, Souls and Estates to save, and found your Majesty resolved (if they had pleased) to save all, they upon the score of your Royal Grace and Mercy to them shewed at the beginning of your Reign, and continued Clemen∣cy, would have invited to have joined in with your Ma∣jesty to have preserved that Religion they profess, and not in stead of that to have attempted the Murther of your Person, and the Invasion of your Realm with a Foreign Power, in order to restore an Abdicated King, who hates their Religion, and will violate their Liberties.
I come Sir, now to observe to your Majesty, the Ex∣cellency of this Civil Government, which these Conspi∣rators would change into Slavery. The Kings of Eng∣land Rule not upon the same Terms with those of our Neighbour Nations, who having by Force or by Fraud Usurped that due share which their Subjects had in the Government, are now for some Ages past in Possession of an Arbitrary Power, (which yet no Presciption can make

legal) and Excercise it over their Persons and Estates in a most Tyrannical Manner, but here in England the Sub∣jects do retain their Proportion in the Legislature, and the very meanest Commoner of England is represented in Parliament, and is a Party to those Laws by which the Prince is sworn to Govern himself and his Subjects: No Mony is to be levied, but by common Consent, no Man is for Life, Limb, or Goods, or Liberty, at the discre∣tion of the Supream Magistrate, but we have the same Right (modestly understood) to our Property, that the Prince hath to his Regality.
In all Cases where the King is concerned we have our just Remedy as against any private Person in the Neighbor∣hood in the Courts of Westminster-Hall, or in the High-Court of Parliament; his very Prerogative is no more than what the Law hath determined: His Great Seal, which is the Stamp of his Legitimate Pleasure, yet is no longer current than upon the tryal it is found legal; he cannot commit any Person by his particular Warrant, he cannot himself be Witness in any Cause, the ballance of Publick Justice being so delicate, that not the Head only, but even the Breath of the Prince would turn the Scale; nothing is to be left to the King's Will, but all is subjected to his Authority, by which it follows, that he can do no wrong, nor receive wrong; and a King of England keeping these measures, may without Arrogance be said to remain the only Intelligent Ruler over a Rational People; in recom∣pence therefore, and acknowledgment of so good a Go∣vernment under his Influence, his Person is most Sacred and Inviolable, and whatever Excesses are committed against so high a Trust, nothing of them is imputed to

him, as being free from the necessity or temptation, but his Ministers only are accountable for all, and must an∣swer it at their Perils: He hath a vast Revenue, con∣stantly arising from the Sweat of the Labourers and the Rent of the Farmer, and the Industry of the Merchant; and consequently out of the Estate of the Gentleman a large competence to defray the ordinary Charge of the Crown, and maintain its Grandure and Lustre; and if any extraordinary occasion happen, or be but with any probable descency pretended, the whole Land at what∣soever season of the Year, doth yield them a plentiful Harvest. So forward are the People to give, that a Fo∣reigner would think that they could neither will nor chuse, but that the asking of a Supply was a meer piece of For∣mality, the People of England being so ready to give it. The King of England is the Fountain of Honour, and hath the distribution of so many profitable Offices, of the Hou∣shold, of the Revenue, of State, of Law, of Religion, of the Navy; and when it is necessary that the King hath an Army, he disposeth of a multitude of Military Offices, that it seems as if this Nation had scarce Men of Abilities to supply all these Employments. So that the Kings of England are nothing inferior to other Princes, saving in being abridged in injuring their own Subjects, but have as large a Field as any of external Felicity, wherein to ex∣ercise their own Virtue, and to reward and encourage it in others. In a word, your Majesty hath enlarged our Liberties, in consenting to the Bill to Regulate Tryals in Cases of High-Treason; in which there are large Immuni∣ties granted to any that fall under that black Circumstance, that their Lives may not be at the mercy of a Mercenary

Judge, or Judges, if God should in his Judgment leave poor England to such Men: But your Majesty hath be∣gun, and I question not but your Royal inclination will carry you on to compleat our security from such Vermin. Therefore to conclude, what a Government is this we enjoy, than which nothing can come nearer the Divine Perfection! The Monarch enjoys a capacity of doing all the good imaginable to Mankind, but under a disability of doing any thing that is Evil.
This Scheme of the Civil Government the Late King did well know, and therefore in Council on the day of his Accession to the Crown, he was pleased to say, That the Laws of England were sufficient to make the King of England as great a Monarch as he could wish or desire; so that your Majesty may see that he could own that the Greatness of the English Monarchy had its Birth and rise from the Laws. Who then would have lessened him∣self as he did, by breaking in upon those very Laws that had made him Great? And who would have broken so excellent a Government as made him Secure and Happy? And what Subject of England, Papist or Protestant, that would lose such Immunities and Privileges, by joyning in with that unhappy Man to destroy themselves: Were they so in love with King James, that they were not satisfied till they had him? Nay, he and they waded through King Charles's Blood that he might Reign: Why then did they not keep the terms of the Government, which would have been the most effectual way of continuing him on the Throne. Besides all this, we cannot forget that the Par∣liaments under Queen Elizabeth, King James, King Charles the First, and King Charles the Second, made it Treason

in whosoever that should attempt to Seduce any one of the meanest of your Majesty's Subjects to the Church of Rome. And the Long Parliament held in the time of Charles the Second, to all Penalties of the Statute Law added an in∣capacity for any Man to say, that that King was a Papist, or an introducer of Popery. What Lawless and incapable Miscreants were these! What wicked Traytors were those Men who did indeavour to pervert the whole Body of Protestants, and to bring that about in effect, which even to mention, was penal; at one Italian stroke, attempting to subvert the Government and Religion, to kill the Body and damn the Soul of the Nation.
Your Majesty finds to this day, there are such a Set of Men in this Nation, who have undertaken and have made it their business under your Majesties happy, legal and perfect Government by the intended destruction of your Royal Person to introduce a French Slavery, and instead of so pure a Religion that your Majesty ventured hard to preserve, to establish the Roman Idolatry; either of which Crimes are of the highest nature; for if we look upon the Government, if the Murther of your Royal Person be a fact so horrid as no Man can find words e∣nough to declare his detestation and abhorrence of it; how much more then is the Murther of your Royal Person, with an intent to Assassinate the Kingdom? And Sir, none will deny, but that to alter the Monarchy of these Kingdoms into a Republick, is High Treason. So by the same fundamental Rule, the Crime is no less to Murther your Royal Person, in order to make the Mon∣archy Absolute.

Sir, I beg your Majesty's leave to tell you, that my Heart is much enlarged to your Majesty; I beseech your Majesty that your Royal Heart may be for this one time enlarged to me in your Grace and Pardon, for this trouble I now give your most excellent Majesty: Let me undertake upon seri∣ous inquiry to give your Majesty some satisfaction who these Men are that have from the Year 1660, to this day, at∣tempted to Subvert our Government and our Religion. Had these Men been the old honest Cavaleers that fought for Charles the I. or suffered much in the time of Charles II. it would have been allowable in them, as oft as their Wound did break out at Spring or Fall, to think of a more Arbitra∣ry Government, as a sovereign Balsom for their Aches, or to imagin that no Weapon-Salve but that of the Moss that Grows on an Enemies Skull, could cure them; or could they (to have kept their Hands in ure) have fought their Cause over again, since they saw they were neglect∣ed and left to Starve, yet their Age and times they lived in, and their unjust usage they met with from two Kings, might have pleaded something on their behalf in mitiga∣tion of Damages. But Sir, give me leave to make this Remark to your Majesty concerning those Gentlemen, that they were and are still (if any of them remain) too Generous, too good Christians and Subjects, too affectionate to the English legal Government, to be capable of such an Impression; whereas these Conspirators that carried on the design of subverting our Religion into Popery and chan∣ging the Government into downright Slavery, are such as have not one drop of Cavaleer Blood, or no Bowels at least of a Cavaleer in them, but such as starved the Cavaleers, to revel and surfeit upon their Calamities,

making their Persons and the very Cause by pretending to it themselves, almost Ridiculous.
Or had these Villains been all of the Popish commu∣nion, and avowed so to be, give me leave to say it over again to your Majesty, your danger would have been the less; their Religion would in some measure have been answerable for the Errors and Extravgancies they might have been guilty of to promote it; but these render their intended Villany more black, they were Protestants, and of the Church of England too, that joyned with Papists to Assassinate your Royal Person: What can any Man say for them? Your Majesty knows what to do with them: These Villains, because I perceive they lye under a great difficulty to find Accomplices enough at home to Mutiny and Rebel and Murther your Majesties true and loyal Subjects, therefore they put them∣selves under the Banner and Pay of the French King, to compleat their wicked designs and purposes, to bring a foreign Enemy to Invade us; that King being endowed with all those which in a French Prince, or in an Abdica∣ted King, may pass for Vertues; but in any private Man they would be Capital; and moreover, so abounding in Zeal for Popery and Slavery above all other Princes, that none else could engage both Body and Soul in such a Villanous Undertaking; to which Consideration, adding that their Interests are both one, and the one is, and the other would be the Master of absolute Dominion, and both are inveterate Enemies to your Majesty and this Protestant Kingdom; and the French King is in all respects the most likely to support, maintain and uphold them in those Attempts, they being so exactly suitable to the in∣clinations

of his Soul, yea, and of the Late King's Soul too, notwithstanding your Majesty's being his Nephew and Son-in-Law into the bargain.
Sir, these Conspirators have made it their business to asperse your Majesty's Government, because of the great Taxes that are upon the Nation; but I never find them to take notice of the Treasure that K. Charles II. wasted. It's true, he was engaged in two most impious Wars against the Dutch, and these Wars were very chargable to the Nation: But besides those two Wars, he spent abundance upon his Whores, Pimps, and Bauds, under the notion of secret Service, and yet we find nothing to be said of that: Our Taxes are greater than ever the Nation paid; but your Majesty's Loyal Subjects do not believe them so heavy, but that they can and will hold it out many Years. In a word, there are none that retain their Loy∣alty and Duty to your Majesty, but are highly pleased with your Majesty's being fully supplied to carry on so necessa∣ry a War; and there is no good Man but will rather hazard his Person to keep the Enemy abroad, than see either a French or Irish Army within your Kingdom of England, destroying our Substance, burning our Habita∣tions, and committing those Barbarities that were done in the Palatinate by the one, or in Ireland in 41 by the other; so that your Majesty may see, that we that are English Men are not so much concerned at our Taxes, as at the imminent Dangers your Majesty is daily exposed to, both at home and abroad. And (being more confident than perhaps becomes me, to judge the thoughts of Men;) I believe the Conspirators are more concerned that your Majesty is yet in the Land of the Living, than

at any of these Taxes, of which I suppose their proportion is but small.
But your Majesty is not the first and only Prince that Fugi∣tive Conspirators have traduced, as these have filled the Ears of the French King and the Late King, with monstrous Sto∣ries of your Majesty's Oppressing the Nation with unheard of Taxes, thereby insinuating to him and his chargeable Guess, how easy it would be to reduce the Nation, that they might have farther opportunity of revelling and surfeiting upon his Treasure. So the Fugitive Conspirators in the time of Q. Elizabeth, were perpetually whispering in the Ears of the then King of Spain, with prodigious Stories as false as Hell, thereby to Exasperate that then great and Powerful Mo∣narch against the Kingdom, and did disparage the Forces of the said Queen, and the posture and conduct of her Affairs; in order to make him believe, that the Conquest of England to be a matter of no great difficulty: They did calumniate that Queen's Justice, and blamed her pro∣ceedings against Seminaries and Romish Priests, and for having a jealous eye upon those of their Communion, for receiving those Priests and Jesuits thus sent into this Realm to seduce her Subjects, and to withdraw them from their Obedience; but our Conspirators could not traduce your Majesty, or blacken your Government with those Points; none might have been more easie and qui∣et under your happy Government than they, if their Vil∣lainous Principles would have suffer'd them; and not only so, but they might have had Preferments too, whilst poor Sufferers, and your hearty Friends were Starving, had not their damnable Insolencies and implacable hatred of

your Majesty's Person and the welfare of the Kingdom been an obstacle in their way; but that which I shall ob∣serve to your Majesty, that they traduced that Queen with overcharging her Subjects with heavy and unaccu∣stomed Taxes: But it was then well known, that no Prince could maintain such a Fleet at Sea, and such an Army at Land without great Expence and Charge; for her main end was to prevent a Foreign Invasion, by which that wise Queen certainly knew would be more Expensive and Chargeable to the Nation, than a Maintenance of a Force at Sea and Land would be to prevent it.
It is not unknown, that your Majesties Prudence and Conduct hath appeared, that tho your Majesty found the Nation in a Lamentable Condition, the Trade Sunk, Liberties Seized, the People in a Ferment, the Ensigns of the many Murders committed in the Reign of the Late King, upon the Gates of the City, and upon your Maje∣sty's accession to the Throne, a necessary War to be com∣menced, yet the Trade hath in some measure been pre∣served, Liberties restored, the condition of the Nation much mended, and like to be more and more impro∣ved, both as to its Honour and Interest, the People Quieted, and Reprizals about to be made for the Mur∣der of our Friends. Your Majesty hath Reigned now Seven Years, and never raised one Penny without the consent of Parliament, and by the Authority of the same; and the Late King had not Reigned seven Hours, but he Levied Mony without Parliament: But I would fain have these Fugitive Cut-throats that envy and malign your Majesty's easie Government, to compare the necessi∣ties

of Queen Elizabeth with the urgent occasion your Majesty hath of greater Taxes than ever that Princes could pretend to; for it is most plain beyond all contra∣diction, First, that Wars are now more chargeable in this Age than in that which she Reigned. Then it is plain, your Majesty hath had but little or no Assistance (the Dutch excepted) from any Protestant Prince, or any other Prince of the Confederacy; but you have been rather necessitated to help them; in the last place, your Majesty hath every year of your Reign, been obliged to have great Forces both at Sea and Land; the Charges of your Maje∣sties Predecessors have been for the most part Volunta∣ry; their Soldiers fought upon these Terms, no Purchase, no Pay; and therefore the Subjects were not so much bur∣thened by Foreign Wars, but they went forth to Conquer. Now its plain, that for a King to defend his own Realm and the Liberties thereof, is more Expensive than to Con∣quer other Princes Countries, for the Conqueror would always pay himself and Army in his new Conquest: But Sir, that which is a wonder to me is this, that they should complain to King Lewis and King James of the greatness of the Taxes here; ca hey think that although he should comply with them once more to Invade us, yet at the same time to charge your Majesty with that thing as a high Crime, must be an unmannerly Charge, since the French King himself doth the same every Year, by his own Arbitrary Despotick Power, that your Majesty hath only done by the Advice and Consent and Authority of a dutiful and loyal Parliament.

But truly Sir, I must here acquaint your Majesty, that some People have condemned the French King and King James too, for giving Credit to these Conspirators; for first they ought to have considered, That none of the vain Pamphlets that either Ferguson or L'Estrange, or any of that rascally Crew ever writ, were ever able to shake the natural and dutiful Affections of our English Nation to your Majesty; and of this I am sure they have had sufficient Experience. In the next place, many of these Conspirators are Priests and Jesuits, more fit to manage a Pen than a Launce, to dispute of Philosophy, than to di∣scourse of War; to have a low opinion of their own Parts, than to be prodigal in their Assurance; and let them say no more than what is true, and judge that to be the great truth that is best made out. In the last Place, if that those have not been of the Tribe of Levi, yet then they have been Fellows of desperate Fortunes, which they are ambitious to advance by Lies and the ruin of their Country.
I do not wonder why they traduce and asperse your Ma∣jesty's Government, for they are and have been for many Years plotting your Ruin and Destrtion, both before and since you were our King; and the business is plain, that they can never hurt your Person, till they have destroyed your Interest, and have withdrawn a considerable Party from your Majesty, by which they may make a Stand; then they may possibly (if not discovered) make an at∣tempt upon your Person, which they cannot do till your Interest is destroyed by their many traiterous Aspersions (and they believed) thrown upon your Majesty.

Nay, tho King Charles the Second did comply with them in many things; yet because he did not comply in every thing, they spared not him, but made it their busi∣ness to traduce him; it is true, his Government was Cen∣surable, because he complied not with the Terms and preserved not the fundamental Constitutions of an English Monarchy; therefore his Government was exposed to the Censure of some that opposed even his proceedings, when they had liberty, as they were Members of Parliament, for they had just Ground to believe that he closed with the French Interest, against that of his own Kingdom, and with the Popish Party, in order to betray the Protestant Interest both at Home and Abroad; and the Conspirators they let lose their Tongues against him, because he was not wholly theirs, but ever and anon gave them the slip, by which they were disappointed in their Designs; there∣fore in a Letter of theirs to their Party in Scotland, they plainly say, That he was so addicted to his Pleasure, that he was not fit to Govern; and in another Letter they charge him with unsteadiness in his Resolutions as to Religion; and when they had a design to hasten his Exit, then they charge him with all the Falseness and Vileness that might be imagined to be in the worst of Men; so that your Majesty is not the only Prince that these Miscreants have Traduced: And truly it filled me with great Horror when I saw their Industry in dispersing their filthy and scandalous Libels against your Majesty and Government, it being the method of those Men first to beget a disaffection in your Subjects against your Majesty (if it were possible) that your Destruction might be the more easily accomplish'd

by them, but your Majesty hath been very happy; for nothing these Villains could either Write or Speak, ever made the least impression upon the Hearts of your Loving Subjects; but on the other hand it filled them with Zeal against that party of Men, especially since they were so high∣ly sensible of that Grace and Clemency by which their Lives had been continued to them, for we all know that this was not the first Conspiracy that they have been en∣gaged in against your Majesty; I pray God it may be the last.
Give me leave to put your Majesty in mind of a Pas∣sage in one of Mr. Coleman's Letters to the French King's Confessor which is this; he saith there. The Design prosper∣ed so well that he doubted not, but the Business would be mana∣aged to the utter ruin of the Protestant Party. So the de∣sign of these Cut-throats prospered so well, that they did not doubt but that in a little time their Business would be managed to the Destruction of your Majesty and your Protestant Subjects; for they carried on one Design to Murder your Person, and another to Invade your King∣doms with a Foreign Force; and they were much in the right, for it would have been impossible for them to have Restored the Late King by an Invasion, and to have set up Popery and Slavery, without destroying a Protestant King and the Protestant Interest in England. All good Protestants I hope will find to their great Satisfaction, that these Traitors have brought Destruction upon them∣selves and their Party; and that not a Man of them shall Escape; for your Majesty's Proceedings with such, will be as quick as their Gunpowder, and much more

effectual: So that your humble Subjects may rejoice in your Majesties Justice upon these Men, since Grace and Clemency could not Reform them.
Sir, I was a Discoverer of a Conspiracy carried on by the Popish Party, for the Destruction of King Charles the Second, and your Majesty when Prince of Orange, and for the Subversion of the Government, and the Prote∣stant Religion in England, and all over Europe; but it was my Misfortune to discover a Conspiracy to a King, that was engaged in every part thereof, but that of his own Life; and I met with such Opposition from the then Duke of York and his Conspirators, that it was scarce possible for me to have withstood it had not I had a more than an ordinary Presence of Mind to have supported me: This, Sir, I say, was my Case, yet notwithstanding all the Opposition I met with all, I gave the Popish Party such a deadly Wound, that they could not be cured of it, no not in the Reign of the late King, though they had all the Incouragement that Men could have, because the Villany of that Par∣ty of Men stuck so upon the Minds of the People of England, that no Stone was left unturn'd to rid our Hands of them, and their Popish King, which was ef∣fectually done, when your Majesty undertook and compleated the Deliverance of this poor bleeding Na∣tion.
Many Men have wondered that the late King when he was Duke of York, should have such an Ascenden∣cy over his Brother King Charles the Second; since it is well known that when King Charles was upon

his return Home to enjoy his Crown, that the Duke of York, with the Queen Mother, was in a Conspira∣cy to have destroy'd King Charles, to the end, that he, the said Duke of York, might have return'd Home and enjoy'd the Crown himself; the Lord Arlington disco∣ver'd the same, and so the design was baffled, yet no Man was so much in favour as the Duke of York, and as a Testimony of the King's Grace and Favour; He was made Lord High Admiral of England, and held that Office till he openly refused the subscribing the Test, ac∣cording to an Act made in the Year 1673: But he en∣joying that great and mighty Office of Lord High Ad∣miral of England for several Years; He obtain'd the King's Favour; the Court was at his Will and Commandment, either for love to him, or for fear of his Greatness and Authority: He so demeaned himself to the King his Bro∣ther, that that King would never believe that the great Interest that he had acquired by the Greatness of his Of∣fice should ever be abused to the prejudice of the Go∣vernment; but for the King's Service and Benefit he in∣creased the number of his Friends and Followers, by gra∣tifying some with Naval Preferments, and others with Mony, always imploying his Purse, his Credit, and his Countenance for the strengthning his Party; and that in such a manner as that the King could not but perceive it, yet he so dissembled the Matter, and pretended to such a degree of Obedience and Affection to the King, and gratify'd him in his sinful Pleasures, that the King did not distrust his Proceedings, and that he might continue in the King's Favour, he made it his business as much as in

him lay to comply with his Humours and Humane Frail∣ties: And when he was forced to lay down that great Office, by reason of his refusal of the Sacramental Test above-mentioned, he obtain'd of the King, that his Friends and high Church Conspirators might be put in Commissioners of the Admiralty in his place, he made all the Ministers of state sure to him, so that when he was banished into Flanders, a first and a second time, and af∣ter his return he procured that the Duke of Monmouth should be banished the Court, he judging him to be his Enemy, and then his Conspirators endeavour'd not in vain to keep the said Duke of Monmouth in discredit with the King: But the then Parliament being sensible of the dangerous Conspiracy against the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and the King's Person, carried on by the Popish Party, and finding that the Duke's being a Papist had incouraged them in that Hellish Plot, they having great hopes of his coming such to the Crown, they fell upon the Duke, and to prevent the Storm from falling upon the Duke, the King sends him into Scotland, after that he had bridled and sadled that Kingdom in some measure to his Hearts content: He ap∣plies himself to his Friends to procure his return, he is ac∣cordingly permitted to return, to the great Joy of his Party: He fawns upon the King's Whore that he kept in the Matted Gallery at White hall, and who he created Dutchess of Portsmouth, who had a great Interest in the King, and obtain'd at first or last whatsoever pleased her of the King, that whosoever he was (were he never so high in the King's Favour) that displeased her in time

lost the King's good Will and good Opinion; this Duke carried himself so towards her, that he seemed to affect nothing more than her good liking, and yet not so desi∣rous thereof as that he would wholly depend thereupon, knowing that the King although he always attributed much to this infamous Whore, and was pleased that she was Reverenced and Respected, yet he could not well bear that her good Will should be sought above his own Royal Favour: But the Duke did continue his Friendship with her, hoping in time to command them both; and when ever he found any of the King's Mini∣sters not throughly complying with him, and not ready to follow his Designs, he laboured by all means to have them removed and others put in their Places, who would not fail him in his wicked Designs and Purposes, nor to depend wholly upon his Favour, and also to make him privy (if need were) to whatsoever Business and Affair of State they were commanded by the King to di∣spatch; whereby he came (tho he were out of the Coun∣cel upon the same account as he had left the Office of Lord High Admiral) to the perfect knowledge of all that was purposed and determined by the King's Privy Coun∣cil; and he was in such Favour and Credit, that even the principal Officers about the King, either for Faer or Love, or by other Mens Examples, submitted themselves wholly unto his Devotion; and he had such Interest in the King's Court and Courtiers, that all, or most part of them, seemed to be at his sole Disposition, and to affect him more than the King himself. He having Installed himself in this manner in the Court, and in a great

measure withdrew the Hearts of the principal Officers thereof from their Duty and Love to their King: He thought it also not enough to be invested in their Favours, but all the endeavours were used that he might have the Affections of the Common People; to procure this, he obtains the help of a filthy Strumpet called High-Church, whose Blasphemous Preachers of Passive-Obedience and Non-Resistance, did him mighty Service in order there∣unto: And what Feasting there was provided for the Apprentices of the City of London, who were a sort of young Men who were to be by his Conspirators debauched in order to his Service; and by the great promises of his Grace and Favour he easily and quickly perswaded the Conspirators to favour his Cause and Conspiracy: Nay, all the legal Force throughout the Kingdom, from the Lord Lieutenant of a County, to a Deputy Lieutenant, and Captains, Lieutenants, and Ensigns and Serjeants, were all and every of them his Creatures; the Justices of Peace and Sheriffs were his Admirers, and the Custom-house and Excise were all at his Devoire, from one end of the the Kingdom to the other; and generally Vintners and Ale-drapers were of his Interest; and so was old L'Estrange the Guide, and his little Scoundrel Clergy of the Church; by which means many of the Common People were so ready, willing, and desirous to perform and accomplish his Pleasure, as that in respect of their Obedience to him, he seemed, to lack nothing but the name of a King, to be one. Notwithstanding the great Honour and Reve∣rence the Court shewed him in the Reign of his Brother, and the Love and Affection the Commonalty did bear

him; the nearness of his relation to the King, and the mighty Interest he had, and the unaccustomed Authority he had in so slie a manner Usurped, the high Attempts and Imaginations he had lodged in his Heart, and the great Opinion he had of himself, yet he was so far from appearing puffed up with Pride and Disdain to those that were much below him, that he thought not scorn to give Audience to the meanest Man that had business with him.
Now, how could a Man of my Circumstances, having provoked him by the Discovery of the Hellish Conspiracy, carried on by him and his wicked Popish Party, and Po∣pishly affected, stand against such a Man of such an In∣terest; for he and his Party when they could not hurt me by their Subborned Witnesses against me, not only to destroy my Reputation, but my Life? Then they procured King Charles to take away my Maintenance and Prote∣ction; and this angry Duke he Sued me for charging him to be reconciled to the Church of Rome, and then Su∣borned Witnesses against me, and procured me in his Brother's Reign to be Indicted of two pretended Perju∣ries; but he being impatient in his Expectation, he snatch∣ed the Crown from his Brother's Head, and mounted the Throne, and then he and his Popish Witnesses, his Packt Juries, and Impudent, Lawless, Senseless and Mer∣cinary Judges compleated my Ruin; and I must have been destroyed, had not God by your Majesty's coming to England rescued me beyond all Expectation.
Give me leave Sir, with the humblest Submission to your Majesty, to observe, that where there is a Subject of

such Credit with the King, of such Authority with the Court, and such Power in every County of the Kingdom, as the Duke of York had when he was a Subject, and to have such an Interest in the Church and Civil Govern∣ment, and Military Employments, and Naval Preferments: Could it be possibly hard or difficult for him to insult over and suppress those Truths I then Revealed, for the service and preservation of the Religion, Laws and Liber∣ties of my Native Country, against him and his nume∣rous Party. And how much more was it easie for him to destroy me when he had the Crown it self upon his own Head? But above all, Great Sir, how can it be, that such a Subject, perverted to such a Villainous Religion, should not be most dangerous to his Prince and Country? And to what a lamentable State and Condition he brought it when he had Possession? your Majesty well knows.
It was therefore high time for the Protestants of this Kingdom to implore your Majesties Aid and Help in that Hour of Distress, that the Nation was brought to, by that unhappy Person, and his wicked Accomplices; and bles∣sed be God, for putting it into your Royal Heart to come over to us, and to bring along with you a Force suffici∣ent to defend your Person from him, and his Conspira∣tors; and tho he and they would have insinuated, that your Majesty came to Conquer us, and Enslave us; and notwithstanding the villainous Scribling of some that would to this day assert your Majesty's Title to be by Con∣quest. We that are Protestants, do from the bottom of our Hearts believe, That your Majesty had no other de∣sign

in your Royal Undertaking, but to procure a settle∣ment of Religion, Liberty and Property of the People of this Nation, on so sure a Foundation that there might be no danger of this Nation's Relapsing into the like Miseries at any time hereafter: And for the Justice of your Cause, your Majesty may appeal to God, and to all Pro∣testant Kings, Princes, States and People, in bringing a Force sufficient to suppress the Conspirators and their damnable hellish Conspiracy: And with the like Justice your Majesty then might require and adjure all En∣glish Protestants to assist you against those Enemies of God, his Christ, his Gospel, and the Rights of this Na∣tion and Liberties of Mankind. And your Majesty might with the like Justice have Punished those as Banditi and Free-booters, and common Rogues and Traytors to their Country, that should have appeared to Oppose your Majesty in so Glorious a Work you had undertaken for the Rescuing three Kingdoms out of the Jaws of Hell, Rome, and France.
Since God engaged me in asserting the Laws and Liber∣ties of England, and the Protestant Religion, and in dis∣covering the Malicious and Hellish Designs of the Popish Party against us, the Opposition of that Party and the Passive-Obedience and Non-Resistance Clergy-men grew strong and thick upon me, and how those Varlets run in with the Popish Party, together with their Guide, Sir Ro∣ger L'Estrange, to decry the discovery of the Popish Plot, and would to this day decry by the very same Method they then used, the present Discovery of this Hellish Design against your Majesty's Royal Person, and the Re∣ligion

and Government of this Nation, if they had but hopes to go off with Impunity, and by your Majesty's leave I dear challenge any of these Men to tell me what particular there was by me discovered, that did not in process of time come to pass: It will be to tedious to re∣cite all particulars of the discovery of the Popish Plot, that did come to pass, and from the dismal and sad Con∣sequences of that Conspiracy your Majesty under God hath delivered us, or else these Villainous Traytors would insult, and ask why and to what end your Majesty expo∣sed your Royal Person in your late Glorious Undertaking, in the Year 1688?
The evil usage I have had from our Popish high Church, Non-juring Conspirators, hath so hardened and inured me to suffering, that I praise God, who hath taught me some weak Rudiments of his heavenly Art, of drawing Light out of Darkness for mine own use; I have not been trampled upon for so many Years to so little purpose as to remain yet either ignorant or insensible of mine own Vileness, and to what Element I am nearest allied, or so tender or querulous as either to complain of the weight of those who still go over me as the Stones in the Street, or to project the suffering of any Man in order to please or solace my self, my long Deprivation and want of respects from some that should have treated me as a Christian, a Gentleman, and a Presbyter of the Church of God, is now turn'd into an Athletique habit, some what after the manner of those, who through long Fasting lose their Appetites, and withall either Con∣tract or find an Ability or Contentedness of Nature,

to live with a little or no Meat afterwards; I can, through the Strength of Christ, suffer my self to be oppressed, and from my poor Dunghil whereon I sit, behold both Friends and Enemies, that with much Contentment, and suffici∣ent Enjoyment of my self, partaking of the good Things of this Life, the more, because that God still preserves your Royal Person from the Attempts that the Trayte∣rous Conspirators have so often made to destroy You and the Nation, from the intended Invasion by our implacable Enemies, that would destroy and enslave us.
Next to Christ and this Truth, I shall, with the utmost Breath and Power I have, according to my Oath and Duty, in what Place and Station soever I am, endeavour to be found Loyal and True to your Majesty, as my Rightful and Lawful Sovereign Lord and King, as all good Subjects and Christians ought to be; and I cannot forbear, out of the great and sincere Zeal and Affection that I bear to your Majesty; bless God for the great Con∣cord there is between your Majesty and Protestant Sub∣jects, which your Majesty hath found to have turn'd to a good account to your Ease, Comfort and Peace, in the managing your Affairs of Government both in Church and State, and it is a great Comfort to your good Peo∣ple to see your Majesty relying upon your two Houses of Parliament, for your necessary Ease and Help in this day of your Just War with the French Nimrod, and Destroyer of Mankind.
It was a great Blemish in the two last Reigns to those two Kings, for that rather than they would trust in a Parliament, according to the fundamental Constitution

of this Realm, they chose rather to follow the Advice of their never to be forgotten corrupt Ministers of State, who pretended great Loyalty to those Princes in their se∣veral Reigns, or rather Compliance with the Humours and Humane Frailties of those two Monarchs; but they were neither true to those Kings nor their Country, or themselves herein, for they erected and preferred an Im∣perial Paramount, Self-end or Lust, before all which those two Kings were brought unworthily to serve and promote to the disturbance of the Publick Peace and Welfare of the Nation. It was a false Suggestion that those Conspi∣rators did use to those Kings, that a King that Rules by his Will is more great, glorious, or strong, than a King that Rules by Law, the quality of the Retinue, best proves the State of the Lord, the one being but a King of Slaves, while the other, like God, is a King of Kings and Hearts, notwithstanding that Hellish and Trayterous Doctrin, made such an Impression upon the Hearts and Souls of those Princes, that nothing prevented them from putting that sort of Doctrin into Practice; but the want of a competent Stock, with which they would have certainly set up the Trade, especially since they saw the Example of such an Allie, whose Interest, and theirs was all one; but God that hath preserved your Majesty in so many Dan∣gers, hath also preserved you from such wicked Councils and Councellors too, which is a great Specimen of your long and happy Reign over us.
Sir, my Pen hath transgressed the Line and Law of my Intentions, these confined me to a much narrower Compass in this my Epistle Dedicatory to your Majesty,

and prohibited me the troubling your Majesty to such a degree as now I have done; the truth is, my Zeal, Duty, Loyalty and hearty Affection to your Majesty hath inter∣posed and occasioned this Transgression. Your Majesty knows that Love is bountiful, and I trust, will produce a Par∣don from your Majesty, as it hath brought forth this Trans∣gression from me, in which I have with all my Heart designed nothing but what may be consistent with your Service and Interest: And, I must say thus much, that your Majesty being thus often marked out for Destruc∣tion by these Conspirators, shews, that your Majesty is neither a Friend to these Men, nor their Principles, either in Religion, or in Politicks; and that we ought to make use of it as a proof of your Majesty's Affections to the English Nation, and as an acknowledgment thereof, by me be pleased to accept of this poor Endeavour of mine, and give me leave in all Humility, to lay these Papers at your Royal Feet: Many of your Loyal Subjects are capable of presenting your Majesty with what is more Suitable to the greatness of your Understanding; but nothing can be laid before you that may satisfie your Majesty of the truth of those things which these Conspi∣rators stood guilty of for these twenty Years last past, and have now given your Majesty a plain demonstration how Restless they have been, and still are, notwithstand∣ing all the Arguments of Grace and Mercy that have been used to reduce them to Reason and Obedience.
There is now no more danger (if your Majesty plea∣ses) from these Men that have Conspired against your Life; for the danger of Conspiracies lyes in being Con∣cealed;

none ever Perished by a detected Plot, but such as have abandoned themselves to be Destroyed; and this was the Case of Charles the Second; he chose rather to de∣sert himself and Safety, rather than the Discoverer should not be exposed to the implacable Malice of those who Conspired against his Person and Government. But Sir, with your Majesty it is clear another thing, you will let the World know that you are not joyned in this Conspi∣racy by any Personal Accession, as that unhappy Prince was in that that was against him. Therefore Sir, it is past the Malice and Strength of your Adversaries, either to de∣stroy your Royal Person, or subvert your Government: Besides Sir, your Majesty using those Endeavours that becomes so great a Prince, to have these Conspirators far∣ther detected and brought to Justice, puts your Majesty within the promise of the immense Wisdom and Almigh∣ty power to interpose, to save and preserve you.
I have great grounds of assurance that your Majesty is fully satisfied of the Duty and Affection of your ever du∣tiful and Loyal Protestant Dissenting Subjects, who have been for many Years Persecuted for the Testimony of a good Conscience, in the two last Reigns, for no other reason but because they would not part with their Civil Rights as English Men, nor their Spiritual Rights as Chri∣stians, to these Murderers of the Soul and Body of the Nation. Nevertheless, in the two late Reigns they con∣tinued more quiet under their many and great Persecutions and Oppressions, than the Conspirators did under their daily Favours and Caresses. The Principles of your Dissenting Subjects teach them to obey a Lawful Autho∣rity,

whilst the Principles of these High-Church, Non-Juring and Popish Cut-throats, carry them on to Murder Kings, and Invade their Countries with a Foreign Force and Power. They could not find one of these Loyal Men that would so far undervalue themselves as to have the least acquaintance with these Villainous Cut-throats, much less to engage with them in such a barbarous Design; and no Man questions, but that your Majesty will now put a distinction between those Men who would (if they might) serve your Majesty, and those who would have Traiterously destroyed your Person and subverted your Government, by introducing Popery and Slavery among us.
That your Majesty may long Live, to assert and pre∣serve Laws; the Laws of the most High God in your own Soul to your Eternal, and the Laws of the Land to the Temporal high Peace and Felicity of your Majesty and People, and abound in all the Blessings of this and the o∣ther Life, Health, Grace, Wisdom, Wealth, Power and Vi∣ctory over all your Enemies, both at home and abroad, shall ever be the Prayers of
Great SIR,
