Madam,
THe just and grateful Resentment which I have of the unmerited kind∣ness, and friendship of your late most Worthy and Noble Husband Sir George Blount, of your Ladiship, and your whole Family, obliged me, impatiently to desire an occasion, to make a publick Ac∣knowledgement thereof. Permit me there∣fore here, to offer to your Ladyship this small Present, in which notwithstanding, I can challenge no Interest or Right, but only the Care of publishing it. The Author of it, is a Person of your own Sex, who lived about Three Hundred years since, intended it for You, and for such Readers as your self, who will not be induced to the perusing of it by Curiosity, or a desire to learn strange things, which afterward they will at best vainly admire, or perhaps out of increduli∣ty contemn. But your Ladiship Will,
 I assure my self, afford Her a place in your Closet, where at your Devout Retire∣ments, you will enjoy her Saint-like Con∣versation, attending to her, whilst with Hu∣mility and Joy, She recounts to you the Wonders of our Lords Love to Her, and of his Grace in Her. And being thus employ∣ed, I make no doubt but you will be sensi∣ble of many Beams of her Lights, and much warmth of her Charity, by reflecti∣on darted into your own Soul. Now that such may be the effects of this Book, is the desire of
(Madam)
