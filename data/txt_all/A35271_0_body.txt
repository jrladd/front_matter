MADAM,
BEing unexpectedly called out of my Obscuri∣ty,
to the Glory of serving your Highness,
(and indeed the whole Court) in an En∣tertainment
so considerable as this; my fears
and amazements were such as (I believe) Shepherds and
Herdsmen had of old, when from their Flocks and
Herds they were call'd to Prophesie to Kings. I knew
not how to interpret the meaning of that Command,
which laid on such feeble shoulders, a burden too heavy
for the strongest to bear. Fain would I have shrunk back
again into my former shades, and hid my self in my Na∣tive
Obscurity; but fearing to dispute with Oracles, and
resist Heavenly Powers, I adventur'd on dangerous Obe∣dience,
knowing that if I must perish, it was better to
perish a Martyr, than a Criminal. But recollecting my
self, I remembred that Divine Commands were Presages
rather of Favour, than Ruine; That when Heaven
prest any to his Wars, he gave 'em Courage, as well as
Pay: This made me hope, that in the glorious Work to
which I was called, I should be inspired.

And this I thought it my duty to believe, when I re∣membred
in whose Service I was employ'd, in the Service
of a Princess, over whose great and victorious Father, a
glorious Genius alwayes hover'd, assisting the meanest
of his Followers, when engaged in Services of his, of
what kind soever; and sure (thought I) he will not
neglect me, now I serve so fair, so excellent, and so conside∣rable
a part of him; now I am under the shadow of his
wings, I shall partake of his influence. This made me
think it a sin to despair, and thrust me on with all the
boldness and giddiness (but, to my sorrow, not with the
exalted Raptures) of one inspired: For, after all, it
was not with me according to my Faith. This Poem sa∣vours
too little of Inspiration, and too much of my own
weak unassisted self: Nay, as it was first written it came
even short of my self, and sure that must be a wretched
thing which wants the perfection I can give it. And
though no man is to blame for having no more Wit than
he has, yet he is an ill-manner'd Churle, who will not
spend his whole stock to entertain such a Guest. For my
defects and inabilities, Nature alone must answer, (and I
am heartily sorry for them) but I must, with all submission,
charge your Highness with being the occasion of my latter
Offence. If you will invite your Self to the greatest Table in
England, and not give 'em time to prepare, you will not
find an Entertainment fit for you. A Poem, is a thing, con∣sists
of many and different Images; and though a Man's
Estate be but small, yet if it lies in many hands, it will
equire time to get it in. Nature her self proceeds al∣ways
slowly, and gradually, to Perfection; nay, we find

Heaven pondering and consulting, when he was to make
a Creature on which he meant to bestow Excellence. I
will not pretend, that I have Materials in me, to have
formed a Poem of such perfection, as so great an Occasion
required; but I am certain I could have written some∣thing
more worthy of your Highnesses Favor, and the
great Honor to which this was preferred, had I had time
enough allowed me to ripen my Conceptions. But (Madam)
if your Highness did expect, I should have endited
Thoughts fine as your own; and made you speak as excel∣lently
as you think, you then laid a task on me too great
for any thing but an Angel For none can have Angeli∣cal
Thoughts, but they who have Angelical Virtues; and
none do, or ever did, in so much Youth, come so near the
perfection of Angels as your Self, and your young Princely
Sister, in whom all those Excellencies shine, which the best
of us can but rudely paint. But, Madam, what need was
there of that perfection of Wit, the Charms of your Per∣son,
Youth, and Meen, the Lustre of your high Quality,
and the extraordinary Grace that attended every thing
you said and did, spoke to the Eyes and Souls of all that
saw you, in a Language more Divine than Wit can in∣vent,
in a Language wherein Nature entertain'd 'em
with her own Ingenuity, and by a thousand charming Ex∣pressions
so took up all their attention, that the best of Wri∣ters
could not have made you speak any thing, your Au∣dience
would have been at leisure to regard, or for which
they would have descended from one moments pleasure of
admiring you. The foresight of this, made Fortune, who
alwayes loves to favor the least deserving, throw the

honour of this service on me: she knew there was no need
of Excellence in a Writer, when there was so much in
you; and since the best of Writers would not have ap∣peared
considerable, indulged her humor in selecting the
worst: A favor, which in many respects exalts me above
all my Contemporaries, and will make the World judge
me, though not the best, the happiest Writer of the
Age.
But, Madam, as it is the Fate of all things to be sub∣ject
to inconstancy, and neither happiness nor misery last
long, especially when in Extremes: This Poem, made
like the first Man, by the Command, and for the Service
of a Divinity, (almost out of nothing too) and pla∣ced
at the instant of its formation, in a Paradise of Hap∣piness
and Honor, now driven from its blest Estate, and
its ever flourishing Gardens, is going to wander round
the World, in a condition of Poverty, Misery, and Exile;
where, in stead of its past Felicities, the many Visions of
Heaven, when the soveraign Glories of this Isle descend∣ed
frequently to visit (and seem'd to recreate themselves
in) its Bowers; instead of the extreme Lustre it re∣ceived
from the most graceful action of your Highness,
of the Princess Anne your Sister, and of the other young
Ladies, which like so many beautiful Angels attended
you, it is now condemned to Want and Nakedness, to
starve under the cold wind of Censure, to all the sufferings
that the Native of a rich and happy Soyle, must expect
when banisht to cold and barbarous Regions. In this
condition, forced by its misery, and bound by the duty of
a Creature, it makes this humble Sacrifice of it self to

your Highness, to beg such a share of your Protection and
Favor, as may enable it to live in a condition, becoming
a Creature which had once the Honor to be so near to you,
and to receive such particular Graces from you. Your
Highnesses Favor will yet make it spend its dayes in
Honor, revive with pleasure the remembrance of the past
Glories, and give an immortality, not only to this poor
Poem, but to the (otherwise) most obscure name of,
MADAM,
