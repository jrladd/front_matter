WHat maketh me willing to publish this pamplet, your L. will easily iudge by the argument; what helpes I haue had there∣in, so many as haue hard your Lorships publike exhortations or priuate conferences in matter of religion, will as easily coniecture, it being in∣deede nothing els but a gleaning of your L. great haruest, and a cluster of your owne vin∣tage. And therefore what cause I haue to sue for your honourable approbation, I neede not proclaime vnto the world, saue that I must needes confesse my selfe by many many bonds, more then I may well make knowne, to be ty∣ed in all duty vnto your L. to whome next vn∣der almightie God and her sacred Maiestie I owe whatsoeuer I haue besides this corrupti∣ble man. I may not particularize your honou∣rable and innumerable fauours, least I exceede
the limits of a preface, and breake the bonds of sobrietie, and so incurre the iust displeasure of your Lordship. Only I craue pardon herein to acknowledge that as once in the Vniuersity by your Lordships happie hand I was brought into the sheepfolde of the great sheapheard, so in your honours seruice I haue beene led con∣tinually by the same gratious hand in and out to the greene pastures and pleasant streames of euer liuing water, and learned that which may stead me all my life long, and in the worlde to come for euer, it I be not wanting vnto my selfe. Wherefore may it please your Lordship, to vouchsafe me your wonted honourable fa∣uour to couer whatsoeuer my defects in this attempt, and to accept this testimonie of my true and due affection to your L. I shall be still more and more bounde, and I hope alwaies mindfull to bowe the knees of my heart vnto the highest, (whose recompence is a sufficient reward) for the continuāce of his gratious eye vpon you, and all your honourable affaires for euer.
