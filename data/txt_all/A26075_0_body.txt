Gentlemen,
THough I am not a Native of your County, yet I heartily bless God, that I am an Inhabitant. For I do with the greatest Thankfulness acknowledge, that my Lot is fallen in a pleasant Place amongst you: Where for many Years I have enjoyed the Satisfaction of a most comfortable Retirement. And being thus far yours, by
 Affection and Interest, I could not think it decent to Dispute your Commands, either for the Preaching or Publishing this short Sermon.
That it may, through God's Blessing, be In∣strumental to promote those Great and Noble Ends of your Yearly Meetings; viz. Friend∣ship and Charity, is the Prayer of
Worthy Gentlemen,
