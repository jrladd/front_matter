May it Please Your Most Excellent Majesties, and You Right Honourable Patriots,
THE Civil State being the Power and Sword of the Lord, to do his Commandments: Therefore when GOD commanded King Saul utterly to Destroy Amalek,  did it not fully, but spared Agag their King, and the best of the Cattle to Sacrifice to the Lord: The evil effect that befel Saul for doing the Lords Command negligently; was first to himself; God Rent the Kingdom from him; and then to the whole house of Israel, Haman one of the seed of Agag the Amalekite, sought the Destruction of all Israel, had not the Lord by a miraculous Providence prevented it.
Now, Why must Amalek be utterly destroyed? Because when God had Delivered his People out of Old Egypt, and they were Travelling Peaceably, Faint and Weary, through the Wilderness, to the Promised Rest, the Land of Canaan, a Type of Heaven; Amalek destroyed some of them: Even so the very reason is, why the Lord hath said, The Kings
of the Earth shall hate the Whore, eat her Flesh, and burn her with Fire, even these Spiritual Amalekites, the destroyers of the Lords People, that are come out of the Spiritual Egypt, Travelling to the Heaven of Everlasting Happiness and Rest with Christ in Glory, through the Wilderness of this World.
Now then, because when this Work was begun by former Kings in this Nation, as after is shewed, and not yet fully done (in utterly destroying these Spiritual Amalekites, not in their Persons, but out of Church and State, so that they might bear no Office of Trust there,) but have Retained them still; see what had like to have been the effects thereof; their Elder Brethren were coming in a pace to possess their old Places, and had so far prevailed with the King (to his great ruine) to destroy the Nation out of their Rights and Pri∣viledges, and perhaps out of their Lives at length, if the Lord had not by his miraculous Providence wrought our De∣liverance; so that the Lord hath once more put into the hands of You the Supream Powers of this Nation, to do the work the Lord hath commanded, fully: Pardon my boldness, There is a time to speak, if fitly spoken, how good it is; which may serve but as a Candle to your Sun-light, in the due sence of these things; therefore this may only serve to stir up your minds by way of Remembrance, That if this work be fully done by You, a Blessing will be upon all your good works, in setling this Nation in Peace; as saith the Scriptures, When the Lord giveth Quietness, who can make Trouble? And when he hideth his Face, who can behold him? whether it be done against a Nation or a Man only, Job. 34.29.
