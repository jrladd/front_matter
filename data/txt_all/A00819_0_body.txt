WHAT it pleased
God (right Ho∣norable)
to ina∣ble
me to speak
of late before
your Lordships
in her Maiesties Court at Green∣wich,
I haue, as neare as I could
remember, layd downe here now
in writing, to the ende, that what
then both pleased and profited
some, may in the blessing of like
mercie, do the same againe, and

what misliked anie, may be fur∣ther
considered, whether it so de∣serue
in deed, or was but only thē
mistakē. VVhich litle labor I am
bold to present vnto your Ho∣nors,
who with most holy and re∣ligious
attention heard the same,
that vnder the like fauour of your
Honorable countenance, being
foūd without cause of iust dislike,
it may both passe to the view of
others also that heard it not, and
remaine a poore testimony of my
dutifull heart and true affection
towards your Lordships euer to
my death.
