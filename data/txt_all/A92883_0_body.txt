Madam,
YOur vertuous Requests, to which your Merits gave the force of a Commandment, oblig'd me to send my Devout Companion into the World; and, Madam since it hath met with so Candid a reception by your La∣dyship, whose early Piety proves so ex∣emplary; a Second Obligation pre∣sents it self, wherein I esteem it a kind of Sacriledge to defraud you of being a Patroness to that, which you may so justly challenge.

Prayer and Meditation are the Golden Rules towards a good Life; and we can never miscarry in this dark World, if we walk by the Light of a sincere Conscience: For with these Holy Guides we implore the Almigh∣ty, to cleanse our Hearts from all vain and unlawful Thoughts, our Mouth from all foolish and idle Words, and our whole Lives from all wicked and unprofitable Deeds.
That which I offer now, Madam, to your Divine Consideration, is Mortality; a Theme which some ne∣ver care to hear of, others are ne∣gligent in preparing for it, and many use their utmost endeavours to put it, as an Evil day, far from them; but all their Strategems are in vain, for Death is so potent, and bears such sway that none can resist his invincible Power; none is exempted from the silent Grave, nor none knows how soon they may be called: Well-complexion'd Nature,
indeed, may struggle here for a time, but at last must yield it self to that pale Messenger.
Our chief Business here, is to trim our Lamps, and be vigilant; to sow the immortal Seed of Hope, and ex∣pect hereafter to reap the increase: To deprecate the Almighty, not to cut us off in the midst of our Folly; nor suffer us to expire with our Sins unpardoned: But to make us first rea∣dy for that Celestial Kingdom, and then to receive us into eternal Glory.
This, Madam, is the only intent of this ensuing Treatise: and may these short, but plain Directions have that influence on those Persons, which stand in need of these Di∣vine Truths, is the hearty and ear∣nest Prayer of,
Madam,
