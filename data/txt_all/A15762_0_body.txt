THE Patriarkes in olde time cōplained (right Honorable) that the dayes of their pilgri∣mage were short & tedious:Genes. 47 Iob 14. 2. Tim. 3.1. but we may truly say, that the days of our crooked aged are most wretched and dangerous.Apoc. 12.12 Whē Satan (whose wrath being great because he knoweth his time but short) is transformed into an Angel of of light: and his peeuish Ministers fashio∣ned like to the Apostles of Christ,2. Cor. 11 13 14. hauyng their heads so fraught with nouelties, their harts so ful of hypocrisie, and their toongs so smooth, eloquent and plausible: as by the persuadable words of mans wisdome, they are able to deceiue (if it were possi∣ble) euen the very elect.Mat. 24.24 They fil our eares with vaine iangling, striuing and conten∣ding about Church-plots and principles of doctrine (euer learning,2. Tim. 3.7. and neuer able

to come to the trueth) as though Religion consisted onely in speculation, wythout action, hearing, without doing, or know∣ledge, without execution To the great dis∣couraging and amazing of many a simple soule. Who though in zeale of conscience very careful to please God, and feareful to offend him: yet by reason of ignorance vn∣able to discerne medicine from poison, or Religion from Superstition. For whose comfort and directiō in the way of truth, godlinesse and vertue, I haue penned this litle volume. Which, as a true testimony of a thankefull minde, for those fauourable courtesies your Lordship hath vouchsafed to shew me, I haue presumed to dedicate vnto your Honor: in hope, that in passing vnder your good name, the people shal the rather be moued to take the same in good part, and apply it to their profit. Humbly beseeching you to pardon my boldenesse, and accept it as willingly, as I offer it faith∣fully. And as duety bindes me, my dailie prayers to the Almightie for your Honour shal not cease during life.
