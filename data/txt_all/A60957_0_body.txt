SIR,
I Have sometimes wondred how the Dedication of a Book or a Pamphlet to a worthy Person, could be called or thought an Instance of paying Re∣spect, or doing Honour to the Patron, where the Discourse has but little worth in't.
Upon which Principle or Opinion, Sir, the pre∣fixing your Name to this Discourse, would rather look like an Affront, than a Dedication; and make me as much inclin'd to beg your Pardon, as I should be to think I needed it; did I not know, that as you would have all you converse with, to be truly Wise, truly Happy, and truly Good; so, you may Countenance the meanest Endeavours, that with clear Intuition, undisguised Sincerity, and Purity of Intention, have such Aims and In∣tendments, which is all that can, (and I am afraid, more than ought to) be said, for this Sermon.

'Tis usual to tell the World, that the Publishing of a Sermon, was desired by some of the Hearers: Now tho I might say so too; yet should I mention who they were, it would derive as little Honour up∣on their Judgment, for desiring it, as can accrue to my own, for consenting.
Sir, if you find (as you will) two or three Pa∣ges more-here, than what was delivered; I am to assure you, that 'tis what was prepared to have been spoken; if the shortness of the Day, and some o∣ther Reasons, had not made me think fit to wave it.
The great Respect, Sir, you have alway shewn to our whole Order, and particularly to the Person whose Obsequies we lately celebrated; your Counte∣nancing and Encouraging your Excellent Lady's late pious Action of Building of a Tower, not intention∣ally to her own, but to the divine Glory, (for I am confident, if it had been possible, she would have con∣ceal'd it, till the Resurrection) That Prudence and Zeal, with which she began that Act of Piety, and has conducted it all the way, makes me (among ma∣ny others,) desirous to be thought by both, and by all that know me, to be
SIR,
