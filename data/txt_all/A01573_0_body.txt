HOnorable Sir, I acknowledge freely that
the World is oppressed with the Presse, ad
the confluence of Bookes hath bred a confu∣sion
of errours, of Vices; so hard is it to
distinguish betwixt profitable and vaine
Writinges; and hauing culled out the best, so easie is it
with much good Meate to surfet; yet is not therefore Meate
vnnecessarie: It is no sober inference, because both Text
and readers haue been corrupted with false Glosses, to reiect
all Expositions, all Applications: both are fitte, this latter
most necessary; for our Vnderstanding is better then our
Conscience: there is some light in our Minds, litle warmth
in our Affections: So against Nature is it true in this, that
the essentiall qualities of Fire, Light, and Heat, are deui∣ded;
and to say, whether our light of Knowledge be more,
or our heate of Deuotion lesse, is beyond me: Let this (con∣sidered)
plead for me, that I (doe but) rubbe this sowning
Knowledge in vs, to bring it backe to some life of Obedi∣ence:
If any feele their thicke eyes hence to receiue any
clearenesse, or their nummed Affections to gather (the
least) Spirit, let thm at once, giue God the glory, and take
to themselues the comfort. Sinne hath got strength with
age, and against all naturall order, is more powerfull, sub¦tile,

and fuller of actiue dexteritie now in the dotage of it,
then it was in the nonage: Both Pulpit & Presse are weake
enough to resist it. It therfore this small Arrow of Reproofe
can wound (but euen) one of his Limbes, it shall a litle ener∣uate
his tyranny. Whatsoeuer this Sermon is, it is wholly
yours, and he that made it: whose Patronage, I could not be
ambitious of, if I should onely fixe my eyes on my owne de∣seruinges:
but in the affiance of your good natures, mature
iudgementes, and kind constructions of my weake endea∣uours,
I haue presumed to make you the Patron of my La∣bours,
who was freely the Patron of my selfe. I know, that
Gods word can countenaunce it selfe, and needes not the
shelter of an humaine arme, not, though it had as many
Edomites to deride it, as it hath Patrons to defende it:
But I find not onely the best Writinges of the best Men, but
euen some of those Holy Bookes, inspired from Heauen, bea∣ring
in their foreheads (as from the pen-men) a dedication.
I confesse, it is not all for your Protection, somewhat for
your vse; and you are blessed in fauouring that, which shal∣be
best able to fauour you: May I therefore intreate your
Honors, to giue it happy entertainement to your owne
heartes, fauourable protection to the worldes eyes; so shall
that, and my selfe be (yet more) yours. The God of all power
and mercie, be as fythfull a shadow of refreshing to your
soules, as your kindnesse hath been free to my wantes, who
must euer remaine.
