THE former Journal of the honourable House of Commons, lately published, found so good a Reception amongst persons of Quality, that it hath given encouragement to the second to appear in Print. The purchace of so many written Coppies as have been dispers'd at so great rates (notwithstanding the many imperfections they are fraught withal) de∣monstrates sufficiently, the vallue curious people sets up∣on them; how much more acceptable therefore must they needs be, when purged from their Errors, and brought down to such a reasonable price, as to afford Gentlemen the benefit of them in their Libraries, with∣out any great Tax upon their Purses. The other Vo∣lumn gave the first light of the Discovery of the Popish PLOT; which is made more manifest in this same:
 For here the Curtain is drawn open, the Scenes plainly appear, the Actors are brought upon the publick Stage, the fair Masque of Religion is pluckt off from the Fowl Face of Treason, which appears in its own dis∣mal hue, so ugly, as to make all conscientious Men, of what profession soever to start at the horrid sight of it. Nay so far did they go on in the pursuite after these Sons of Darkness, as to detect the very Soul of this Contrivance, and wanted but little of doing them that Justice as would have put an End to this Infamous Tragedy; which is now left till another Season to be compleated upon those Wretched Conspirators. Be∣sides this, here are many other extraordinary matters contained in these few sheets; to ennumerate them, were to transcribe the Journal, which being the com∣pleat Account of a whole Session, must be of great weight to considering men. The litteral mistakes of the Press, is not (as we hope,) a Sin above the mercy of the Candid Reader. God long preserve his Sacred Majesty, and make his two Houses of Parliament Suc∣cessful in all their good Counsels and Ʋndertakings,
Farewel.
