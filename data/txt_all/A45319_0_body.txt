NOthing could fall out more hap∣pily to me, then that my bold Adversaries have appealed to your inviolable Justice; for sure I am, whiles you are (as you ever wilbe) your selves, wise, and just, my cause cannot mis∣carry in your hands. With no lesse, therfore, but better grounded confidence, I cast my self upon your unpartiall judgement; re∣joycing to think, how clearly you will distin∣guish betwixt a facing boldnesse, and a mo∣dest Evidence of truth: How can I but re∣ceive

courage from your pious, and just proceedings? It is I that vindicate, these men oppose that holy Leiturgy, which your most religious Order in this Active session com∣manded to be intirely observed. How busie Faction is to crosse that your most seasona∣ble Decree, every day yeelds new and lamen∣table proofs. If these indeavours of mine serve onely for the pursuance of your so ne∣cessary, and gracious Act; they cannot fear to be unwelcome. But, if I have hurt a good cause, by a weak and insufficient handling, let me suffer in your censure, and let my Ad∣versaries triumph in my sufferings. Contra∣rily, if after all their smooth insinuations, it shall be found, that this champertous com∣bination hath gone about, by meer shews of proof, to feed the unquiet humors of men, in the unjust dislike of most justifiable, ancient, and sacred Institutions, and to cast false blames upon my peaceable and sincere ma∣nagings of a certain Truth, let them passe for what they are, and feel that justice which they have appealed.
