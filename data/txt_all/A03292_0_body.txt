SIr, as a pledge of
the respect I owe
you, I haue made
my selfe bolde, vnder your
name, to set forth this Ser∣mon.
The olde prouerbe,
which forbiddeth to send
Owles to Athens, hath
taught mee not to send this

to you, as a matter of sup∣ply:
you (now) liue at the
wel-head (from whence I
confesse, and reioyce, my
selfe to haue drawne that
little, by which it hath
since pleased God to ena∣ble
me to the doing of som
seruice in his Church) and
were (long since) one of
those iudicious and painful
Diuines, at whose feete I
sate (with many others)
in the dayes of my prepa∣ration
to that worke; wher∣in

I now (by the assigne∣ment
of the Lorde of the
vineyard) am imployed.
In this therefore, I desire
rather to be thought to pre∣sent
you with an account of
mine own courses, thē with
any direction for yours:
The two verses before this,
I haue preached on, and
the Sermons are abroad.
As I helde it necessarie to
treate on this also, so I
thought it fitting to publish
that, which concerning it

was giuen mee to deliuer.
There is no one thing (I
thinke) in which our ordi∣narie
hearers, are either
more vnskilfull or more
backward, then this dutie
of trying doctrines: what
vnsettlednesse in opinion,
what vnsoundnes in iudge∣ment,
this hath caused, I
doubt not your selfe in your
long experience haue ob∣serued.
If I shall preuaile
ought to the curing of this
Epidemicall disease, I

shall glorifie God in that
behalfe. My endeuor that
way, I haue shewed in this
small Sermon: vvhich
(here) from your hand, I
commend to the common
vse of Gods Israel: from
Modburie in Deuon.
