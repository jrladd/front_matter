I Could not have such high thoughts of my shal∣low cogitations, as to deem them worthy to be produced before such an Auditory, or pre∣sented to the publike view: Had not there∣fore consciousnesse of dutie constrained, I had become an earnest suiter to have been excused: but of actu∣all obedience I had many, of excuse-pleading I found no pre∣sident. Your Injunction then made me to aspire to the work which now humble craves your Patronage; and whither should the labours of this kinde runne, but to that honoura∣ble Society, which (under Heaven) is the fountain of these gracious opportunities?
If willing, no man, I suppose, hath more cause to be large in Apologie then I, having long since had my poore Libra∣ry totally plundered, and my self not able, usque hunc diem, to buy one book of considerable value. Besides, from the beginning of this warre, untill the last moneth, inter

armaubi silent literae versatus. But these things I ac∣count part of my chief happinesse on earth, to have suffered much, and done a little good in the cause of Christ, and ser∣vice of the State: onely I desire, that nce it may not be thought strange, that I tender a plaine unpolished Sermon, quite naked in it's Margent, and in which nothing is cited but the holy Text; nor any author Ecclesiasticall or Mo∣rall heard speak. Seldome, if ever, hath there been offered to your hands such a rude piece of all home-spunne thoughts; neverthelesse, they breathing the force of the Divine Spi∣rit, I trust shall finde acceptance with your  and being stampt on with your approbation, they  abroad in the world currant with all, not malignant or cen∣sorious.
To encourage the progresse of your abundant vertue, I need say nothing in my Epistle, since I speak much  that purpose in the Pulpit: the smallest hint is sufficient to provoke such zeal and willingnesse as ever resideth in your breasts. Goe on therefore in pious and honorable underta∣kings: the hearts, the tongues, the Pe of all good me blesse you; how can it then be, but the God of heaven, who hath set you apart, as chosen instruments also , so universall good to his Churches, should in due time crown our endeavour: with successe; and infinitely recompente your labours in a better world? so prayeth
