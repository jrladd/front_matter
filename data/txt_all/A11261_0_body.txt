RIGT WORSHIPFVLL.
I Am so tyed vnto you by your many fa∣uours,
 as I professe I know not how to carry my selfe in thanksgiuing to you. I haue heere some few thoughts or Meditations which may doe some good, I dedi∣cate them to your Wor∣ship in way of thankes for your fauours. If you aske me for what vse they be of, I answere they are for this vse, to streng∣then vs against the De∣uill, to draw our minds
 from foule sinnes, to ali∣enate our minde from this present world which is euill; to teach vs to or∣der our liues well, and to lead vs foreward to the Kingdome of Heauen. These thinges, whiles many others let their thoughts run a thousand waies amisse, I haue min∣ded, and if they shall be read with the minde they were written, and taken on the right hand.
 They shall I trust not want their due effect, and good acceptance: I know they bee not excellent, and yet I know they be not worst. Your Worthines indeed (whom I haue oft admired) deserues farre better: yet I pray you accept these, and God I trust in time will inable mee to giue a further testi∣monie of my loue. So the Lord of glory keep
 you and all yours:
From my Study in S. Iohns of Mather∣market in Nor∣wich, this 26. of Iuly. 1616.
