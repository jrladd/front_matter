Most Reuerend Father:
THE DEDI∣cation of euery work framed against the Common Aduersa∣ry of our Church and State, seemeth vnto me of right, next vnder his Ma∣jestie, to belong vnto your Grace, in regard both of your Place, and Person. Your Place being as that of Zadock, or Nathan, to King Dauid: your Person worthy of all Honour.
 Whome God and the King haue so greatly honoured with such high and eminent gra∣ces and endowments; as which, truly, none, saue Haereticall and Prophane Spirits of en∣uy and malignitie, can dis-tast; but which the syncerely-christian ought to prosecute with all Honourable approbation and loyal∣ty. The consideration whereof, respectiue∣ly joyned with some other congruent mo∣tiues, hath emboldned me, at this time, sub∣misly to entreat your Graces Patronage of this my first Onset, in this Kind, which I haue giuen to the Iesuiticall Opposite. Wherefore in all humilitie presuming to commend the same to your Graces protecti∣on, I pray God almighty to assist and blesse your Grace, in all your weighty affaires, with his most holy Spirit, and happy succes for euer.
