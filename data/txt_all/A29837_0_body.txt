Worthy Sir,
THE many great Favours and daily
continued Courtesies which I have
received from you, may well chal∣lenge
and command a double Ex∣pression
of Thanks and Acknow∣ledgment:
and as you have ever studied how to
interweave your continual Bounty with the hap∣py
assistance of your great Art and Skill, each of
these heightning both my Advance and Profit;
should I not publickly repay you the Tribute of
all imaginable thankful Acknowledgment, my
hopes of ever doing well may soon sicken, and
like Liquors poured from one Vessel to another,
as readily lose their gust, and grow slat and dull.
And although in these publick Addresses I may
appear impertinnt to offer my Mite to you,
whose Skill in Art is large, and whose Knowledge
in Universal Learning is great; yet have I pre∣sumed
to shelter this Tumefying Brat under your
Wing, and commit it to your Patronage, not as
being worthy your Acceptance, but that it may
receive a kind Value and a candid Repute by your
Acceptation; whose Approbation hereof will be
stamp enough to make it pass current amongst

the Generous Sons of Art. That there may be
Faults in its Conduct, I am not altogether igno∣rant;
but these Lapses look'd on with an ami∣cable
view, will but appear as Moles in a fair
Face. Sir, be you pleased to give it your Blessing,
and it shall venture the Censure or Carping of
others. All I shall further adde is, that when Great∣ness
and Judgment shall be shrivelled to nothing,
or at best into a cold remembrance, your Generous
Charity as well as your great Learning will re∣main
after you as living Monuments to after
Ages. Sir, if you will please to pardon this In∣terruption
with its Imperfections, and accept the
Devotion wherewith they are offered, it will be
the greatest Honour done

Norwich,
Nov. ult. 1677.
