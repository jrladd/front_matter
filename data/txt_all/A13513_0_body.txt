MOst worthy Sir, as Quin∣tilian
in his Apothegmes
to the naked, learned,
Gimnosophists of AE∣thiopia,
very wittily
saies, Potanto Machyo cor∣batio
monomosco kayturemon Lescus, Ollipuff tin∣gere
whingo:
which is, knowledge is a main

Antithesis to ignorance, and paines and
trauell is the high way to experience. I
being therefore well acquainted with the
generous vrbanity innated or rooted in
your humanity, (in these daies of vanity,)
I dedicate (out of my affability, debility,
ability, imbecillity, facility, or agility,)
this poore Pamphlet to your nobility, in
all seruility and humility: not doubting
but the fluent fecundity of your wisdomes
profundity, in your heads rotundity, will
conserue, reserue, preserue, and obserue,
what I & my industrious labors deserue.
I do (out of mine owne cognition) auerre
and abett, that hee is senselesse that will
assent, that the Fates did assigne, with their
whole assistance, that any should aspire,
to be an associate in any assembly, boldly
to assimulate, assay, assault, or ascribe to
any mortall but your selfe, superlatiue ma∣iority
or transcendency for trauels, obser∣uations,
and oratorie. These things being
reuolued and ruminated, in the sagacitie
or acutenesse of my Pericranion, I imagi∣ned
that no man vnder the Cope was

more worthy then your selfe to be a Pa∣tronizing
Poplar to shelter my poore reed-like endeuors. Howsoeuer in the preter∣lapsed
occurrences there hath beene an
Antagonisticall repugnancy betwixt vs,
yet I hope time and trauell hath worne it
thred-bare, or brought it to a most irreco∣uerable
consumption; withall I know you
are vncapable of inexpugnable malice, in∣ueterate
malignancy or emulation. I pro∣test
tongue-tide taciturnity should haue
imprisoned this worke in the Lethargicall
dungeon, or bottomlesse Abisse of euer∣sleeping
obliuion, but that I am confident
of your patronage and acceptance, which
if it fall out (not according to any Prome∣rits
of mine) but out of mine owne expe∣ctation
of your matchles and vnparalelld
disposition, I shall heereafter sacrifice
whole Hecatombs of inuention both in
Prose and Verse, at the shrine of your vn∣fellowed
and vnfollowed vertues. So wi∣shing
more to see you then to heare from
you, because writers want worke, and the
Presse is turned voluntarie through the

scarcity of imployments, which I hope
your presence will supply, I pray that
Neptune, AEolus, Tellus, Bacchus, and all the
watery, windy, earthly, and drinking Dei∣ties
may be officious, auspicious, and de∣licious
vnto you, humbly imploring you
to take in good part this my sophisticall,
paradoxicall, submission, with a mentall
reseruation of my loue and seruice, to sym∣pathize
or be equiualent to your kind li∣king
and corroborated affecting.
