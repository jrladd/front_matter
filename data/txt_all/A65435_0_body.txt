SIR,
THE kind Reception I have met withal from my Parishioners, ever since it has been my Happiness as well as Duty to Preach unto them; and the Encouragement they have given me, in their Favourable Approbations not only of This, but all my Other Undertakings, have oblig'd me to gratify them in their Requests, so far as to appear in Publick in the following Discourse.
It is contrary to the Dictates of my own Incli∣nations, thus to venture my self Abroad: 'Tis purely to oblige them in this, as (to the utmost of my Capacity) I shall be glad to do in all other Re∣spects.
And yet, I must confess, 'tis with a Joyful Sa∣tisfaction I embrace this Opportunity, to declare un∣to the World how deeply I stand engag'd to Your Goodness and Generosity; and from hence I pre∣sume
 upon the Freedom to offer You These the First-Fruits of my Early Endeavours.
To You, Sir, they do most properly belong in every respect; to You, that have been my Worthy Friend and Patron by Your Kindness; my Father, by a perpetual Affection and Indulgence.
To You therefore I humbly Address my self, and beg the Favour of Your Patronage; knowing that (however deficient I may have been in the Manage∣ment of my Subject) You will Accept my Inten∣tions; which are sincerely design'd to promote the Glory of God among those over whom his Provi∣dence has been so signally wonderful: In giving them a Sense of the Mercies they have receiv'd at his Hands; that thereby they may be won by his exceeding Goodness, to praise him for it by their Lives and Actions, and consequently that they may prosper and flourish; as They must do, whoever have the Blessing of God upon them.
This is my whole Aim in the following Discourse; which if it succeeds in any measure, it then an∣swers the Design and hearty Wish of,
SIR,
