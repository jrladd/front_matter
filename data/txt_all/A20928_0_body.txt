IT hath been vsuall and accustomed (Right Noble and worthie Sir) in all ages, and a∣mongst all sorts of people (though otherwise neuer so rude and barbarous) to adorne and eternize the manners, liues, conuersation, gests, birth and sayings of their famous and renowmed, with monuments either openlie and in liuely sort contayning and specifying the same: or more closely and secretly insinuating as much, that so the praise and fame thereof might remaine and liue throughout all ages. The course was good and commendable; for so the excellent and re∣nowmed deceased had but his due: the excellent and renowmed liuing, a glorious and beautifull spectacle, to stirre them vp vnto couragious and vndaunted perseuerance in still making vsurie of their excellencie: and the base, vile, and abiect persons (the spots and blemishes, yea the puddle and mudpit) of actiue, pregnant, and nimble nature, might rouse themselues from the lolling bed of their continuall snorting and dead sleepe. I meane not to bla∣zon and decipher particularly, and from point to point the origi∣nall & antiquite of your Nobilitie: The vprightnes, innocencie, mildnes, humanitie, bountifulnes and loue, in matters concerning your owne priuate affayres and businesses, wherewith your Ho∣norable condition is richly set and garnished. (The vehement sus∣pition of vndermining flatterie, the discontenting of your affec∣tions leaning to the contrarie, and the stirring vp of aduersarie e∣mulation and repining enuie vtterly disswading me). Neither yet doe I meane to proclaime and lay abroad your faithfulnes in the actions of Iustice, your wisedome in the discerning of things
necessarie, and swaying of matters most conueniently for the weale publique, or your prowes and valorousnes in warlike feates and Martiall affayres; howsoeuer the cause of God, your Prince and Countrie: your birth, Dignitie and leisure, hath (I doubt not) put both you and many other godly and religious Noble men within this Realme in minde thereof, and stirred you vp amongst other your godly cares and studies, to striue to become able and worthie, if her sacred Maiestie should at any time call you or them vnto the same. But leauing all these and whatsoeuer other praises, that might iustly be giuen to the manifold vertues, shining both in your selfe, as also in your Honorable Ladie, holding out the markes of a good profession in the loue of the trueth, with sobrie∣tie, modestie, and a good conuersation (notwithstanding the seas of sinne roring round about, and ouerflowing almost all estates and persons) and that so cleerely in the eyes and mindes of all such as doe not willingly winke, and couer the bright light of inward touch, with the vaile of wilfull sencelesnes: my onely indeuour and drift is to intreate your Honors to receiue with fauourable ac∣ceptation and good liking these first fruites of my publique la∣bours, as vndertaken for the good of all: so especially dedicated and deuoted vnto your particular seruice and vse, not so much in respect of any your present necessities, through any infirmities that I am priuie vnto, as to make way for the shutting out of such, as hereafter might creepe vpon you to your vntimely annoyance, assuring my selfe that in the reading thereof you shal finde a well stored treasurie of rich and rare Iewels, and in the practising of it, the comfort of health and contentation in satietie of daies. Which the Ancient of daies, with all increase of Ho∣nor, wealth, and pietie graunt and giue vnto you, and all your succeeding posteritie.
