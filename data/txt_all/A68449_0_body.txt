THE GREAT PRO∣fite which the Christiā minde is to receyue by reading this Booke, was the cause why I tooke the paynes to Translate it out of Latin into the En∣glish toung: and the Recom∣mending therof the more di∣ligently to haue it read, was the occasion which moued me to Dedicate my parte therein to your Honors. For what Englishe man is there which will not thinke it a Booke most worthy the reading, which he seeth warranted by your Names? The honorable and generall report whereof hartneth me to present it vnto you: wherein ye shall finde the deepe and deuine Euangelist Sainct John: the marrow of all Commentaries vppon him, vnder the name of Marlorates Collection: last, and least, my faythfull tra∣uell to turne them bothe to the vse of my Countrey. The thing I know your Honors will like well, bicause, as I heare, you can skilfully iudge, so I doubt not but you haue made your choyce what to reade, which so muche bruteth the credite of your abilitie, founde out

by effect. As for my labor, may it please your Honors to like it, as comming from one, which caught with the commendation of your Learning and Wisdome gene∣rally noyzed, could not but offer my selfe to you, as the wondering Queene of Saba could not rest tyll she had seene Salomons person, of whose wisdome she had hard so muche. And withall I thought it good in offering my labor to your Honors, to ioyne you both togither, thinking with my selfe that it must needes follow, that suche skill and iudgement beeing in so Honorable a man, must needes by societie of matche worke like ef∣fect in so honorable a Mate. Wherefore not to trou∣ble your Honors with longer speache, I take my leaue, Recommending my poore Paynes to your Honors protection, the recompence whereof you shall receiue in your reading of the booke, whose fruite will bring, by Gods grace, health to your soules, and continuance of your Honor.
