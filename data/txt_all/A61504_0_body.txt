SIR
The following sheets, containing for the most part, the complaints of your people, against your Commissioner, doe so naturallie addresse themselves to your Matie., that I could not deny them this inscription; some may possiblie endeavour, to render the presumption more criminall, by censuring what is thus offered, by a concealed hand in a publick manner, for a libelling pamphlet: And truelie I am sorrie, that the mere iniquitie of the objectors, should force upon it so much of a disloyall resemblance; but sieng that it advanceth nothing, which I might not avowedlie present to your Matie., on your throne, and environed with both your Parlts., nd athere own and Iustifie, in every point; I am hopefull, that the truth and im∣portance of what is here honestlie held forth, for your own and your kingdoms good, and not the partialitie of any whose interest it is to have abuses covered, shall incline you to a more favourable reflexion. I must also tell your Matie. that after the endeavours, that have been used, to inform in the more dutifull methods, what appears lesse civill in this (that may be thought too communicative) is neverthelesse excused by a very loyall expediencie; for allbeit your Maties. goodnesse, be indeed the great comfort and hope of

your people, and their loyaltie an impregnable defence, against all sinistruous suspicions; yet this discoverie of some mens peculiar guilt in these strange doeings, wherein for their own safetie, they have dared to involve your Maties. authoritie, may both fortifie, by a generall concurrence, my weake enterprise, for your Maties. better information, and also signallie contribute to, the assistance and reliefe of dutie against too many obvious tentations. However as I am sure, that a successe in this essay, suitable to the sinceritie of the affection whence it flowes, is the most dutifull wish that any heart is capable of; so, that your Matie. may be constantlie di∣rected to those counsels and courses, that may render you the most glorious and blissed of all Princes, is and shall be ever the fervent prayer of
SIR
