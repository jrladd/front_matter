SIR,
LEt mee humblie beg of you, that you would bee pleased to take this Ser∣mon into the Sanctuary of your patronage: your free and gracious promise to be the Patron of the Author, hath imbol∣dened him to intitle you so to his issue. The violence of a wet season denied it some Au∣ditors, which it might haue had, your incou∣raging
 command to haue a sight of it, & the forcible importunity of wel-wishing friends haue pressed it, and giuen it readers which I intended it should not haue had. I apologize not, if it bee better to preach, 'tis good to print: the vnderstanding is not informed, nor the will moued alwaies by the Eare, but sometimes by the Eye; otherwise the suttle Romanists would vnclaspe the Bibles of the Laitie, and not denie them to read the Scrip∣tures. I know your deuotions and your im∣ploiment; God and your Countrie permit you not in the tearme-time to read a long Epistle. I conclude therefore with my pray∣ers to almightie God, that as he hath indow∣ed you with his more eminent graces and richer gifts, so he would put it into the heart of the King to reward them, that your Ho∣nours may one day ballance your deserts, & that in the meane time your dwelling may remaine (as now it is) the oracle of the citie.
From my study in Christ-Church, in Oxford.
Nouemb. 24.
