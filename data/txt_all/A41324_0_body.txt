SIR,
WHEN, at more than the request, of a Noble Member of Your Society, I submitted to this piece of service; I had almost capitulated, that that re∣quest should not extend beyond the Pulpit. And had not the comsciousness of my own mean performance se∣cur'd me (as I thought) from any danger of the Press; I had realy insisted more nicelly on that priviledge. But the contrary commands Sir of Your Honourable Fra∣ternity so useful to the Nation; and to which, we are all (especially in this juncture) so much behold∣ing; brought with them a supersedeas to my first thoughts: And the World now has it as You desir'd,
 that is, no otherwise than You your selves had, without any other Addition or Diminution, except a word or two upon one Head.
I have in it (as to what relates to the Text) con∣fin'd my thoughts to the Word of God: Or rather drawn them from it, as the best Rule of our Acti∣ons: And I am perswaded if we would but consider what God expects of us in every Stage and Station of our Life, we would, without any Perswasions take great care to live as Reasonable Men, and Good Christi∣ans.
I am highly sensible of its defects, but I fear 'twould be to little purpose to offer at an Apology for them (tho considering my circumstances, I have much to say for my self) And since the importunity of that Board, where You so happily praeside, would not admit of a denial; I willingly embrace the occasion to ex∣press the great sence I have of that extraordinary civility, wherewith You and They were pleas'd to treat me. As it could not be merited by me, so neither was it expected, and therefore lays me under the great∣er Obligation to own my self,
SIR,
