May it please Your Grace,
THE Great Ap∣plause
you have so
deservedly meritted, hath

encouraged me to Dedi∣cate
this small Epito∣my
to Your Honour;
and not knowing any
Man, that can with
more lively Colours re∣present
this Important
Affair to the Wisdom
of the Nation, I lay it
at Your Lordship's Feet,
as an UNDERTAKING,
(which if Your Grace
be pleased to Espouse,
for the Good of the
Kingdom) you will
thereby add another Tro∣phy
to your former At∣chievements;

and the
Glory of the Action will
be Recorded to all Po∣sterity:
For upon a Na∣tional-Fishery,
under
God, doth depend the
Safety, Honour, and
Happiness of this King∣dom,
the Flourishing
of Trade, and the
Supporting of Credit,
as in the Sequel of my
Discourse, I hope, I have
made appear.
My Lord, this Age
gives us too many Ex∣amples,
of Discouraging

Ingenuity; many Excel∣lent
Qualities lying of∣ten
hid under humble
Looks, and mean Ha∣bits,
which soon are
discountenanc'd, and sup∣press'd
by Insulting
Greatness and Popular
Opulancy: But You have
shewed by the constant
Example of Your Acti∣ons,
that You have
Agreed with Seneca, in
his Renowned Maxim;
that sola virtus vera
Nobilitas, When so ma∣ny
others, are blinded

with their absurd Va∣nity
and airy Great∣ness.
But you have ren∣dred
your self a true
Patriot to your Country;
and therefore I most
humbly implore this
Book may be sheltred
under the wings of Your
Graces Protection: who
am, Right Honourable
and Renowned
Sir,
Your Graces most humble
And most obedient Servant,
