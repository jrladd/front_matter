IN a willing obedience to your Commands, I here present to your Eyes, what You were late∣ly pleased to attend unto with great patience and Christian chearefullnesse with your eares. Christ Iesus please to speake that to the hearts of the Audi∣tory,
which I did to their eares, that in this time of great sorrow, there may that evidence be to our Ministery (which would be to every conscionable man, a matter of great joy) that some may be undeceived and brought to see the things that concerne their peace: A won∣derfull security and insensiblenesse lies upon our people every where, beside a spirit of con∣tradiction or malignity, deserving a censure like that Act. 7.51. My humble request to you is, that you will please to accept this as an ear∣nest of my affectionate service to you and the Publique. My humble request to God for you is, that he will please to carry on the weighty Services you have in hand for his glory, and the good of the Kingdome of Iesus Christ, and the bringing to passe the worke of Reformati∣on, through so maine, so great oppositions.
