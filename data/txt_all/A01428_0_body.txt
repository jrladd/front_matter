RARE PARAGON of vertne, affying, or rather presuming on your heroicall disposition, I haue aduentured to conduct to the open field of the World Two Centuries of Epigrammes, which, if they bee deign'd to march vnder the Banner of your Ho: protection, I doubt not, but that they may the safer, as they say, Passe the Mu∣ste. And the rather I build on your all-fa∣uourable patronage by reason of your Ladyships neere affinitie with that worthie, and Tresble Sir Phillip Sidney, whose golden Pen vouchsae fed to Apologize the renowned art of Poetry. If thi∣my Rurall, and vnacquainted muse Limm's no forth either in Matter, or Manner the viue ort

traitur of an Epigramme, your Ladyship may ea∣ coniecture, that it was rather Cherillus Pen, and not Apelles Pencill that shadowed it; but ho∣ping the acceptation, with your Ho: protection here∣of, if not for the Worke, yet for the names-sake, I euer rest
Your worthy Ladyships most deuoted Votorie:
WILLIAM GAMAGE.
