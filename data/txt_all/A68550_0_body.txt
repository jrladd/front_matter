Puissant-Prince.
STRONG be Your Armes, and victorious Your Armies, the Lord of Hosts be with You, and the mighty God of Iacob▪ Your Refuge.

That foretolde by Christ is now verified: a noise there is of warres, and a ru∣mour of warres: Nation ri∣seth against Nation, and Kingdome against Kingdome: and now, as John saw in the vision, is the Holy Citty trod∣den vnder foote. It must be so for a time. On they goe & haue prevailed: but yet there is hope, if we warre aright. The great Man of warre (as Moses calleth him) hath di∣rected vs in the Bible bat∣tells; vsefull I hope, for these times: but yet I leaue this to Your Majesties Heroicall wisdome to iudge. Into me∣thod
 and order I haue col∣lected them: and am bolde in all humility of heart to present them to Your Sacred Person. Your Highnesse the Saints looke vnto for safe∣guard The poore distressed Churches cry aloud for help. Is not their habitation be∣come Aceldama, the field of blood? Many Valorous Cou∣rages doe attend the oppor∣tunity of time; many valiant Martialists expect direction, and all hearken after but on∣ly a word of command. Dis∣consolate Princes craue aide: Religion it selfe saith to her Defender, set forward. The
 hearts of the people, readie with purse, I hope, will ap∣peare, as now they pray, ge∣nerally for the Churches safe∣tie.
Stand therefore (ô King) in the Forefront of the Lords Battailes; though not in per∣son, yet in the power of Your Might, to suppresse the inso∣lencie of high hearted Ene∣mies. And the strong arme of the Subduer of Hosts be with you, that this great name of Charles the First, amongst our famous Kings, may become renowned by wisdome and piety, Prowesse and Victo∣ry, throughout the Christian
 world. This be the prayer of all faithfull Subiects, and e∣ver mine.
