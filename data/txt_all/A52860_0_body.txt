Honoured Sir,
THough I am too sensible that the prefixing your name to this Discourse, will look rather like Presumption than Respect; and that I cannot hope for your acceptance of it, without a manifest in∣jury to your Judgement; yet I have (in that short time I have had the Honour to be known to you) made such large Discoveries of your Goodness, as not to doubt but it will so far Bribe your Judgement, as to make it accept of that which it cannot approve; espe∣cially when the principal end of its Dedication to you, is to Congratulate that late Honour, which his Majesty (as a Mark of his particular favour) hath so de∣servedly conferred upon you; nor am I under any apprehension, that I shall by this Publick Notice of it, draw any Odium or Envy upon you, since your being Mounted into the Saddle of Honour, was not the Favour of Fortune, but the Reward of your Exemplary Loyalty; and Honour always sits so well upon Loyal Shoulders, as that it rather attracts love and admiration, than envy; especially when attended with that great Modesty and Humility, which have been so conspicuous in you, since your ascent into the Sphere of Honour, in imitation of the Stars above, which the higher they are, the lesser they are wont to appear: Were I not as well assured of your great unwil∣lingness to have your favours repeated, as I have been sensible of your readiness to bestow them, I should present you with such a Catalogue of my obligations to you, as would swell this Epistle into a Volume; but I will not in so high a nature disoblige you, who have so infinitely obliged me,
Ansty
Aug. 30. 1681.
Honoured Sir
