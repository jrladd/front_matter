A Dedication (according to the
present Mode) must be an
Harrangue on the Accomplishments
of the Person to whom it is Addrest;
But, Sir, though your general Ac∣quaintance
with the Sciences, and

your happy Performances in the most
usefull of them, invite me (on the first
View) to embrace so excellent a
Theam; yet when I reflect how that
on this occasion no Rhetorick can be
Pardonable that is not Extraordinary;
and when I farther Consider how
well your Excellencies are known to
the World, I find that my best En∣deavours
can prove but an Imperti∣nent
Zeal. Besides, Sir, had I been
able to do Justice to your worth and
Fame, yet I have Reason to believe,

that my Silence on that Subject
would with you find better Wel∣come,
than the most Elaborate Pa∣negyrick.
As for the following Po∣ems
(which I have publisht on Rea∣sons
Satisfactory to my self, and my
Friends) they are Fortunate enough,
in having first been Pardon'd, and
then receiv'd into your Favour.
'Twere Injury to the Publick to In∣trude
on those portions of your time
that are employ'd in the Health of
your Countrey; but if the best pro∣ducts

of my humble Fancy may have
Access to your Leisure Hours, 'tis
the highest Ambition of,
SIR,
