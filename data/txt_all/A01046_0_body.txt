MY LORD:
THE glory of a great name, acqui∣red by a greater glory of Action, hath in all ages liu'd the truest chronicle to his owne Memory. In the practise of which Argu∣ment, your grouth to perfection (even in youth) hath appear'd so sincere, so vn-flattering a Penne∣man; that Posterity cannot with more delight read the merit of Noble endeauours, then noble endeavours merit thankes from Posterity to be read with de∣light. Many Nations, many eyes, have beene witnesses of your Deserts, and lou'd Them: Be pleas'd then, with the freedome of your own Nature, to admit ONE amongst All, particularly into the list of such as honour a faire Example

of Nobilitie. There is a kinde of humble Ambition, not vn-commendable, when the silence of study breakes forth in∣to Discourse, coveting rather encouragement then Applause; yet herein Censore commonly is too severe an Auditor, with∣out the moderation of an able Patronage. I have ever beene slow in courtship of greatnesse, not ignorant of such defects as are frequent to Opinion: but the Iustice of your Inclinati∣on to Industry, emboldens my weaknesse, of confidence, to rellish an experience of your Mercy, as many brave Dan∣gers have tasted of your Courage. Your Lordship stroue to be knowne to the world (when the world knew you least) by voluntary but excellent Attempts: Like Allowance I plead of being knowne to your Lordship (in this low pre∣sumption) by tending to a favourable entertaiment, a De∣uotion offred from a heart, that can be as truely sensible of a∣ny least respect, as ever professe the owner in my best, my eadiest services, A Lover of your naturall Love to Vertue,
