My Lord,
IAm so desirous to express my thankfulness to Your Lordship, as for all the rest, so especially, for the last Fa∣vour you have done me, in contri∣buting so freely to the giving me some ease from that burden which grew too heavy for me; that I make bold to prefix Your Lord∣ships

Name to this Book of a great Man in another Nation; which I have Translated, and will live, I believe, as long as Learning and Religion shall last among us.
VVhereby your Lordship will see that I have only exchanged, not given over my Labours; and that I intend not to be less diligent in my station, than when I prea∣ched more: but rather study in∣dustriously to serve the Publick good some other way.
VVhich that I might promote, I have augmented this VVork of Grotius, by the Addition of another Book: not equal indeed in strength of reasoning, and variety of read∣ing to the foregoing; but in bre∣vity and perspicuity, I hope, no∣thing inferiour: And, being a building relying, in great part, up∣on

his Foundations, will stand as firm and unshaken, as those which excel it in beauty, and neatness of contrivance.
Such as it is, I humbly present it to your Lordship; and praying God that the whole VVork may have some effect for the reclaiming those that are irreligious; or the setling those who are wavering and doubtful; and the exciting us all, to hold fast the Truth, as it is in the Lord Jesus, I remain
My Lord,
