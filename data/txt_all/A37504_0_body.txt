YOU that the Gentle Craft profess,
List to my Words both more and less,
And I shall tell you many things
Of worthy and renowned Kings:
And divers Lords and Knights also,
That were Shoomakers long ago:
Some of them in their distress,
Delighted in this business:
And some for whom great wait was laid
Did save their lives by this same Trade:
Other some, in sport and game,
Delighted much to learn the same:
No other Trade in all the Land,
They thought so fit unto their hand;
For evermore they still did find,
That shoomakers bore a gallant mind:
Men they were of high conceit,
The which wrought many a merry feat:
Stout of Courage were they still,
And in their Weapons had great skill:
Travellers by Sea and Land,
Each Countryguise to understand.
Wrong they wrought not any man,
With reason all things did they scan;
Good houses kept they evermore,
Relieving both the Sick and Poor.
in Law no money would they spend,
Their quarrels friendly would they end.
No malice did they bear to any,
But shew'd great favor unto many,
Offences they would soon forgive,
They would not in contention live,
Thus in joy they spent their days,
With pleasant Songs and Roundelais;
And God did bless them with content,
Sufficient for them he sent;
And never yet did any know,
A shoomaker a begging go:
Kind are they one to another,
Using each stranger as his Brother.
Thus lived shoomakers of Old,
As antient Writers have it told;
And thus shoomakers still would be,
So Fame from them shall never flee.
