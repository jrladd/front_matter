Worthy Friend,
LEt him that stands, saith the Apostle, take heed least he fall, and be not high minded, but fear, for God gives grace to the humble, and exalts the meek, but the proud he beholds afar off; it is good therefore for every man to look to his feet, and consider how he stands, by sense or by Faith, by Flesh or Spirit, by Grace or by Works; and where he stands,
 on holy or unholy ground, or the Sand or the Rock, upon the Sea or the dry Land, on Earth or in Heaven, in himself, or in God; whether the Moon be under his feet, and he clothed with the Sun, whether he serve God or Mammon; for if we stand in the Lord we are safe, but if we stand any where else we sink and fall: the Lords Angels pitch their tents about his, to preserve them in all his ways; they shall walk and not be wea∣ry, run and not faint; they walk as wise men, and not as fools, redeeming the time, be∣cause
 the days are evil. And while God gives You opportuni∣ty do good to all, but especially to the houshold of Faith, and be not weary of well doing, for in due time you shall reap, if you faint not; faithful is he that hath promised, who also will do it. Your labor of love is well known to many Saints in De∣dington and thereabout, in Oxfordshire, whose bowels You have refreshed; the Lord make You more and more to a∣bound in Faith and Love, that You may never see Christ na∣ked, hungry, or in prison, but
 You may minister to him, and relieve the oppressed, judg the fatherless and widow, and let the cause of the poor be main∣tained, still keeping Faith and a good Conscience in all things, that Your good example and counsel may win upon many; and if J or my poor endeavors herein may advantage You any way in this kind, it will be the travel of my Soul, and the joy of my Spirit,
Sir,
