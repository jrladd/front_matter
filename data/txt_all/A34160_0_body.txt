SIR,
AT the Instance and Importunity of the Heirs, Exe∣cutors and Administrators of Sir William Cour∣ten and Sir Paul Pyndar, and several of their most considerable Creditors, for whom I have been an Agent almost these forty years last past; am now constrained to write this brief Narra∣tive of their Services and Sufferings for the Crown and Kingdom of England: Wherein so many Orphans and Widows have long Groaned (under the misfortune of those two most Eminent Merchants in the World of their time) whose Tears are not yet wiped away.
Its held for an Opinion amongst the Casuists, that although a Trespassor▪ should be Iudicially acquitted and discharged of a particular Injury done un∣to his Neighbour, without giving him satisfaction: Yet he stands obliged in Equity and good Conscience to make him Restitution and Reparation for the Wrong and Damages sustained.
The Arguments are far stronger against those that have Spoiled Courten and Pyndar in the East and West-Indies with a Continuando. Al∣though their Rights and Properties were Invaded at Home and Abroad, no Power could divest the Proprietors and Interessed in this Case, of their Senses and Reason: In all Revolutions of Government, nothing could make them Disloyal to their Prince, nor Unfaithful to their Country; they never appeared otherwise then with their Humble Addresses for some Season∣able Satisfaction to their Iust Demands.
The Substance of the whole matters contained in this History, with the Prosecution thereupon, are reduced into the following Abstracts (only the Scire Facias brought by His Majesty, and the Plea thereupon, recited at

large, as they remain upon Record, and Humbly represented Methodically to the Right Honourable Viscount Hyde, which will naturally fall under the Consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury) being all con∣tracted at last into three several Petitions, the one relating to the Barbados, and the Products thereof, the second to the Disbursements for the Crown be∣fore the year 1641. the third to the Debts and Damages due from the East-India Company of the Netherlands, and some particular Inhabitants in Amsterdam and Middleburgh, to the Estates of Sir William Courten and Sir Paul Pyndar, wherein the Honour and Interest of the King and Kingdom are concerned to see Right done to the Petitioners respectively, who had many kind Offices done for them in the Premisses by your Father, and have all of them a great Confidence in your Zeal to Iustice, and your readiness to do them all Lawful Favours in the duty of your Office, and with that assurance I remain
SIR,  
July 12th. 1681.
