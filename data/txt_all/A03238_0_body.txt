WHom Heauen with all Choise Graces hath endow'd,
Whom both the Angels praise, and men admire:
On whom her Maker hath his bounty show'd,
Where nothing wants that mortall can desire.


Whose beauties are as farre beyond compare,
As are her inward vertues of the mind,
But in that height vnmatchably so rare
We on the Earth her equall cannot finde.


Her Parents Ioy, the Peeres selected pleasure,
The peoples admiration, Kingdomes wonder,
Of forraine climes the praise, of ours the treasure,
May this daies sacred vnion neuer sunder.


That whilst we daily of high Heauen importune,
We may be in your Royall issue blest:
You may still grow in bewtie, vertue, fortune,
So with your fame our ioyes may be increast.
Proue thou a Prophet, Muse, say t'is decreed,
All Christendome shall florish in your seed.
