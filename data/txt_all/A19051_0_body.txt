POetry (noble Lord) in these loose times,
Wherin men rather loue, then loath their crimes,
If hand in hand with piety she goe,
(Though without blushing she her face may show)
Finds but cold welcome, such things onely take,
As flatter greatnesse, or fond fancie make
A baud to base delight: yet grauer eyes
No sacred lines (though rudely drawne) despise,
And such are yours: vpon this worke of mine
Vouchsafe to let them fall, or rather shine,
With kind acceptance doe but daine to grace it,
And enuie shall want power to deface it.
