WHereas formerly there
hath been some pro∣mise
of my coming
into your parts to preach, and to
pay my Respects to your Worship
for Kindnesses of old; when you,
and others with you, did largely
declare your Desire of having me
your Minister at Paul's Walden:
I should readily have accepted of
your Kindnesses, but that the Vica∣ridge-House
was so ruinous, and a
Promise being past of my being else∣where;



yet I must needs confess my
self to be indebted since to come, and
give you a Sermon: So that I am
so long indebted upon that account,
Us{que} dum usura superat sortem;
That the very Interest doth
far exceed the Principal. How∣ever,
I would have you know, that
I still bear an honest Mind, having
a Desire to pay according to my A∣bility;
and though I cannot come
and pay what I owe in Person, yet
I have sent my Substitute, this Pa∣per
Messenger to supply my Place;
and knowing how well you, and
those about you, stand affected to the
Present Government, I have pitcht
upon Printing a Thanksgiving-Ser∣mon
for the Discovery and Disap∣pointment
of the late Dangerous
Plot of Assassinating His Majesty,

and the Invading this Kingdom
with a design of rooting out our
Religion, under the notion of the
Northern Heresie: And I know∣ing
how stedfast you have been, and
others about you, to the Truth, and
how ready you are to assist its Fa∣vourers,
and to resist its Opposers,
I thought good to present you with
a taste of what I did deliver upon
that Occasion, hoping it may fall in∣to
the Hands of some of that worthy
Family of the Hales, that former∣ly
were my Noble Benefactors. I
hope there are some of that Race a∣live
in those Parts, though I hear,
to my Grief, that Worthy Lady, the
Lady Austin, is dead. God hath
hitherto prolonged my Life, and it
is much upon my Spirit to give you
a Visit in those Parts before I die.

I do but present you with a taste of
my Labours, and wish they may be
well relisht and received by you;
it then may be an Inducement to put
out more of my Labours, yet before
I die. I remember a Passage of
Bishop Latimer's, that he Preach∣ed
in a Sermon before the King,
of one that had brought up his
Son at the University, and a Gen∣tleman
not far off from him, hav∣ing
a Living in his Gift newly fal∣len;
that he might gain it for his
Son, presents him with a Dish of
ten very fair Apples, and had put
into every one of the Apples 10
twenty Shilling Pieces, and sent
his Man with them to the Patron,
and withal to desire him to pre∣sent
his Son to the Living of his
that was fallen. The Man having

delivered them, and desiring him in
his Master's Name to remember his
Son for the Living; the Gentleman
seemed to be angry, and bid him
carry back his Master's Apples, he
would have none of them. Which
the Man did, and told his Master
that he would have none of his Ap∣ples.
Says his Master to him, Car∣ry
them again, and desire him but
to taste one of them, and as he
likes that, to accept of the rest.
Which the Man did, and tells him,
That his Master however did de∣sire
him but to taste one of them.
Which he did, and finding 10 twen∣ty
Shilling Pieces in it, crys out,
I marry, if they be all like this,
thy Master's Son shall have the
Living. I will assure you, says
the Man, they all came off of the

same Tree: Though Symony was
in use then, yet not so openly practi∣ced
as now a-days. The Ʋse that I
shall make of the Story, is only to
tempt you to a taste of my Labours
in Print, and as this is relisht it is
possible the World may have more of
them. So beseeching the Lord to
bless you, and the Worthy Families
not far off from you, I must needs
acknowledge that I still remain,
