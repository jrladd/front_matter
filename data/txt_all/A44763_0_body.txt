Madame,
COuld the Rational soul, whom Philosophy calls the Queen of forms, and Divinity, the Image of the Allmighty, be seen by the out∣ward eye of sense, she would (as Pla∣to sometimes spoke of Virtue were she so visible) rayse in us a world of admiration; We should be so ra∣vish'd with her beauty, and so struck in love, that we would leave all things else to win her favour.
An odd Humorist vapouring once that Women had no souls, was an∣swered by a modest Lady,  Sir, you are deceiv'd, for I can pduce

a good Text to the contrary. My soul doth magnifie the Lord, and it was a woman that spoke it: No less humorous was He, who would maintain that the salique Law was in force in Heaven, as well as in France, which excluded women from raigning. But much more civil was a farewell that the Count of Lemos took of the Dutchess of Pastrana, who having invited him to see a new Palace that she had built, with a stately Chappell annex'd, at his departure said, Madam, I see your body is fairly Housd, but I find that your soul is far better Housd than your Body. Madam, I have the happiness to know your L shp many years (near upon 4. lifes in the law) and truly I never knew any whose soul was better lodgd, and furnishd with more virtues and graces, which makes me resolv'd to live and die.
