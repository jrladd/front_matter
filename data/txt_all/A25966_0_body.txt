My LORD,
AMong the unhappy Irregularities that crept into our Church in the licentious days of Vsurpation, none has proved so difficult to be reformed as that of Baptizing Children in Private Houses, when there is no necessity requiring it; and that too with the Pub∣lick Form of Administration.
For not only they who are Dissenters from us in the main, but (alas!) too many who profess themselves of us, and would take it ill not to be reputed very good Sons of the Church of England, persist obstinately in this Error; and what is worse, are apt to express a high resentment, if the Clergy deny to comply with them, while they at the same time refuse to hear the Church.
But it is our happiness, that their Obstinacy, tho' great, cannot exceed or tire the pious Industry and unwearied Di∣ligence of the Religious Prelacy, to reduce us to that pri∣mitive Decency and Order for which our Church has been ever as Venerable as Eminent.
Of this your Lordship is a very signal instance, whose Zeal to free our Church from this vile Corruption is pro∣portionate to that Authority which you deservedly bear in it, and has gone a great way so successfully in the Cure of that part which you more immediately adorn and govern,

that we are almost assured to see it perfected there by Your Lordship's Hand; as we are encouraged to hope it will be through the Kingdom, by the healing Applications of its Chief and worthily Most Reverend Metropolitan.
And since what is acted by our Governours in a higher Sphere, commands our imitation in our inferior Stations; I, who am not in circumstances of manifesting my obedience in a Reformation, can only testifie my good inclinations to∣wards it, in a weak endeavour of another kind, the fol∣lowing Treatise that takes sanctuary under the Vmbrage of Your Lordship's name. For which, while I offer it to Your Lordship, as an humble acknowledgment of former fa∣vours, I must beg the additional one of Your Pardon; and I cannot despair of that for any thing that wishes well to a design You have still been forward to promote: And in that have added to many others, one more grand Evidence of our happiness in Your Presidency over us, which labors to re∣duce our Practice to the Purity and Splendor of those Rules that ought to influence and direct it.
But, My Lord, I fear to offend as much by a tedious Apologie, as by the unworthy Present I would excuse; and shall make only this for the Imperfections of this Piece, That the Author has so much of the Cares, and so little else of the World, as not to be supplied with leisure and Books for an elaborate performance, such as might be fit to offer to the Churches Service, and Your Lordship's Patronage; than which there is nothing more in the Ambition of,
My Honoured Lord,
