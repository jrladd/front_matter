Honoured Sir:
THe love of vertue, in all ages, hath made some persons illustrious, whose sublime spirite, and choyce judge∣ments, have prompted them to cherish the Arts: where∣by their names have beene magnified in their life, and their memories perpetuated after death. So in this our age, Fame hath deservedly voted and enstiled you, an eminent Mecaenas, for frequenting the Academies, and exercises of science, and for countenance and beni∣ficence to Arts and Artists, which renders you truely pious, prudent, and peerelesse. More particularly, you have honoured Musicke: of whose divine excellencies, all other Arts participate, which may glory, to be as anci∣ent as Time, and expect to live eternally. To your transcendent Noblenesse, and con∣stant love to our Art, I humbly sacrifice this poore Tribute of my service, confessing, I am old, my fruit it in Autumne, and falleth at your feet, yet if you favourably re∣flect thereon, and your obsequious followers grace me to gather it up, and present it to you, it may prove more pleasing to your judicious taste, and delightfull to the palate of others. Your patronage and cognisance, will protect it from the venome of Envie and Ignorance, which if you descend to vouchsafe, you shall highly oblige,
Honoured Sir,
