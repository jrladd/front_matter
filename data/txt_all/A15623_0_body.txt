THou (euen my selfe) whome
next God, my Prince, and
Country I am most enga∣ged
vnto; It is not vnlike∣lie,
but some will wonder,
why, contrary to the
worlds custome, I haue
made choyse of thy Patronage for this
booke, rather then the protection of such
whose mightinesse might seeme better able
to defend it; especially considering such a
Gigantick troupe of aduersaries haue ban∣ded
themselues against the Truth, that one
of them Goliah-like dares raile vpon a whole
hoast of Israel. It may be (I say) some will
wonder, and some scoffe at mee for it; for
which cause (though to answer them with
sic volo had been sufficient: yet to shew I will
not like our Great ones stand so much vpon

my authority as to make my VVill my Rea∣son)
I heere let you know why, and for what
causes I haue done it; the first is this: I
could not amongst all men finde any man,
in my opinion, so fitting for this purpose,
but either my Worke was vnworthy, or too
worthie his Patronage. Secondly, it is
said; Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit:
and I doubting my free speech would hard∣ly
make a Diapason, pleasing to the eare of
a common Mecaenas, thought it best to hold
my tong, or speake to my selfe, whose dis∣position
I am better acquainted with.
Thirdly, seeing I know but what men ap∣peare,
and not what they are; I had rather
indure the Kites tyranny, then with Aesops
Doues make the Sparrow-hauke my Cham∣pion.
Fourthly, if I haue spoken Truth it is a∣ble
to defend it selfe; if not, who-ere be my
Patron, it is I must answere for it. Fiftly, for
asmuch as I know my owne minde best; I
purpose, if need be, to become my own Ad∣uocate.
Sixtly, for my owne sake I first made
it, and therefore certaine I am I my selfe
haue most right vnto it. But seauently, and
lastly (which is indeed the principal Reason) I

haue made this Dedication to thee, poore
world-despised Selfe; euen to put thee in
minde, (seeing thou hast here boldly begun
to bid defiance to the Flesh, and vpon iust
causes quarrelled with the World) that thou
take heed to thine owne words, and not
through basenes of minde or vntowardnes
of Fortune (to thy euerlasting disgrace)
faintly giue ouer so noble a Combate; If euer
aduersitie (as tis like enough) oppresse thee,
yet remember thy owne sayings, and in des∣pight
of outward Destinies haue a care to
keepe an vndeiected heart still free for Ver∣tue.
Or on the contrary, if euer (as tis vn∣likely)
vnexpected Prosperity bee cast vpon
thee, then look to thy selfe, take to thee this
poore booke of thine, wherein thou shalt
see the dangers of it, and be, perhaps, there∣by
staid from many a perilous enterprise,
which that estate might else driue thee
into. Reade it, weekely, daily, yea and
howerly toe: what though it bee thine
owne? thou knowest mans nature to
bee so vncertaine, and prone to forget∣fulnesse,
euen in the best things, that thou
canst not haue too many Memorandums.

The wisest fall, and therefore euery day was
Philip desirous to bee remembred that hee
was a Man; thou thinkest I know, still to re∣maine
what thou art, I desire in some things
thou maist, but vnlesse thou labour it with
diligent watchfulnesse ouer affection, it is at
least much to be doubted, if not altogether
to bee despaired of; thou hast seene many
by an alteration in their estate beene so me∣tamorphosed,
as if they were not the same
men, nor of that Nation.
Nay remember it, thou thy selfe, and that
but vpon a bare hope, or imagination of
some preferment, hast bin puffed vp and ex∣alted
aboue measure: consider now then
how much more thou hadst beene so and
what had become of thee if God had not
by dashing those hopes called thee to thy
selfe againe? Alas! if hee had answered thy
ambitious expectations to thy desire, thou
hadst bin by this time past recouerie and
not thought of this; but delighted in villa∣ny,
bin ouer-mastered by passion, rusht into
all vanity and presumption; yet neuer felt a∣ny
danger, till it were too late to preuent it▪
Thou hast oft wisht thou hadst bin borne to

the like means that others are, which might
it haue beene so, now thou seest thou
shouldst hardly, or neuer, haue come to the
knowledge of those things, that are now
showne thee. Tis true, thou hast lamen∣ted
to be crost in thy preferments, but thou
seest since that it might haue been thy vn∣doing
if it had not beene so, and maist per∣swade
thy selfe, whether it be now or neuer,
it will be to thy good. For tell me, hast thou
not often felt, euen when thou wert busiest
to preuent them; fond loue, ambition, re∣uenge,
couetousnesse and such like Passions
then to inuade thee? Hast thou perceiued
it I say? How much more then would
they haue beene ready to assaile thee, when
quite forgetting them, thou hadst wholly
addicted thy self to the things of this world?
Let mee aduise my deare-selfe then, to make
vse of this thine owne worke, it will be bet∣ter
to thee then all the world: for this good
it may do thee, and to this end I made both
t and the Dedication thereof to thee, that if
euer hereafter the temptations of the world,
the flesh & the diuel, or any occasion should
make thee to forget this mind that thou art

now in: or so blind thy vnderstanding
thou shouldst not perceiue thy owne and
the Worlds follies as thou now dost; That
if thou shouldst be in that miserable state as
many are, to haue no feeling of thy danger:
that if thou shouldst bee wofully flattered
and haue no friend that dares, or loues
thee so well to put thee in mind of thy
transgressions.
Then I haue ordained this to shew
thee what once thou wert, to touch thee
againe with the feeling of thy miseries,
and to bee vnto thee that true Friend,
which, free from all faigned inuention,
shal plainely tell thee, what perhaps should
else haue neuer beene brought againe to
thy remembrance. Looke then that for
thy owne sake thou respect this, how e∣uer
to others it may seeme a trifle. Bee
carefull of thy actions, for seeing thou
knowest the dangerous Passions where∣vnto
Man is subiect, hast showne his vani∣ties,
layed open his Weakenesse, and sharpe∣ly
taxed his Presumptions: If now thou
shouldest wilfully runne thy selfe into
the same euilles, the vvorld would vpraid

thee, this Booke, yea thy Conscience accuse
thee, God and good-men hate thee, thy
fault be more odious and in-excusable, thy
iudgement more seuere, and which is worst,
thy punishment most intollerable; I say
seeke therefore (if for no other cause) so to
carry thy selfe, that at least thou maist
haue a good conscience before God, for
Si Deus tecum quis contrate, but if now ha∣uing
made the World thine enemie, expo∣sed
thy selfe to the malice thereof, and ha∣uing
so many Legions of foes without thee,
thou shouldest also, by thy negligence,
suffer the inuincible fortresse of a sound
Conscience to be crazed within thee, the Di∣ell,
that is alway watching such aduanta∣ges,
would quickly possesse it with an vn∣mercifull
troupe of Horrors, Feares, and
Desperations, that without Gods miraculous
assistance thou wouldest grow wholly past
either comfort or recouery.
For all the World cannot defend thee a∣gainst
thy Conscience, but that beeing with
hee, thou maist preuaile against all the
World. Beware then, doe not like the Zibe∣hum
yeeld a perfume to sweeten others

and be thy selfe a stinking vermine, but
let this thy owne worke bee first confirmed
by thy life and conuersation, yea let it be a
President to thy selfe, for, Tani erit aliis
quanti tibi fuerit, but if not, I say if the
World mis-esteeme either it or thee, yet doe
not thou therefore esteeme the lesse either
of thy booke or of thy selfe, but rather let
them know
That thou hast learned, still thy care, shalbe,
A rush for him, that cares a straw for thee.
But now, though for these and diuers o∣other
Reasons, I haue to thee my Owne-selfe
committed the protection, and made the
Dedication of this booke, yet my meaning
is not that thou shouldst keepe it wholly to
thine owne vse; But rather seeing it is ho∣nourable
to giue, (though none will giue
thee any thing) I haue bestowne this o
thee, that if thou canst in this corrupted
age, finde any, whom desert, and thy loue
may make so deare vnto thee, or whom
thou art perswaded will gratifie, or but
thinke well of thy honest endeauours, thou
maist bee liberall to them both of these
thy labours and expences. But this I con∣iure

thee to; be they neuer so great yet flat∣ter
not, or if he be a man whom thou know∣est
the World speakes any way iustly ill of;
either tell him his fault, or leaue him whol∣ly
out of thy Catalogue: But because I begin
to grow tedious to my owne-selfe, and since
I shall haue Opportunity enough to consi∣der
with thee what is further needfull with∣out
an Epistle, with my prayers for my
Prince, my Country, my friends, and my
wne prosperitie, without any leaue taking,
or Commendations of my Selfe; I
heartily wish my owne
Soule to fare-well.
