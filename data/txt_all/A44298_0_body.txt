GENTLEMEN,
IF this Letter shall happen in any measure to spoil your Trade, Heaven make me thank∣ful; for, well I know, that yours is the very Trade, of two Famous Princes, that have by one Method
or other, ridd out of the way, ve∣ry great numbers of Men.
A Malefactor Condemn'd to Die, ought to be free from all manner of insults as he goes to Execution. I know it, and there∣fore do not Dedicate this Letter to you, by way of Insult, but Friendly to mind you, that since your unrighteous Trade is Broke, or Breaking, You would timely be∣think your selves, what Honest Employment you may be fit for; If you'll take my advice, you shall Travel; for, to your Sorrow, you have known an over-grown Far∣rier from abroad, make a great Doctor in England; Why should not you make as good Farriers a∣broad, as they do Doctors here? This is certain, like true Farriers,
you have Prescrib'd to many a weak Man a Medicine for a Horse; so then, for the Materia Medica 'tis the same, nothing will be trou∣blesom, and uneasie to you; in your New Profession, but that you shall never get as much by Practising on the Spavin, as the Gout; but you must be content with less Earnings; What! you can't in Conscience expect as much for Kil∣ling a Horse, as a Man.
To this Change of your Profes∣sion, not only the discovery of the Frands and Dangers thereof, but also the Name of your Great Pa∣tron Hippocrates invites — What are You more than He? Come, come, , Change Name and Profession, better a Murrain a∣mong
Horses than a Plague among Men.
Having thus oblig'd you, Gen∣tlemen, in an Epistle Decicatory, by minding you of the imminent Decay of your Practice upon Hu∣mane Bodies, and teaching you how to make the best of a bad Market, by trying experiments up∣on Horse-flesh; I hope you will make me that grateful return, as to prevent the Obligation I con∣fer on you from turning to my prejudice; therefore if any Gouty Person that may happen to malign you, shall object against me, and say, I had better have made a Forlorn Regiment of you, and sent you to have been knock'd o'th' head in Flanders, than given you a Licence to Kill Horses,
remember to say this for your Selves and your Benefactor, That when the Devils were ejected out of Humane Bodies, they were suffer'd to enter into Swine.
FINIS.
