ABout xxiii. yeeres past (most
gracious and renowmed So∣ueraigne)
being prest forth for
one of the Gunners in your
Maiesties ships for the West
Indian voiage, (of which Sir
Iohn Haukins was general)
such was our successe before his
returne into England, we were
distrest through want of victuals, nor could we obtaine anie
for money: by meanes whereof many of vs (though vnto our
Generals great griefe) were constrained to be set on shoare in
the West Indies, amongst the wilde Indians. Since which
time (most dread Soueraigne) I haue passed sundrie perilles
there in the wildernesses, and escaped many dangers, where∣in
my life stood often in hazard, yet by the prouidence of the
Almightie I was preserued. And being now returned in∣to

to my natiue Countrie of England, I doe in all humblenesse
prostrate my selfe (together with the discourse of my trauels)
at your Highnes feete, humbly beseeching your Maiestie to
accept the same at your subiects hands, as our Sauiour Iesus
Christ accepted the poore widowes mite. And thus I
humbly take my leaue, praying for the
prosperous raigne of your most
excellent Maiestie.
