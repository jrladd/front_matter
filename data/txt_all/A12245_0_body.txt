SIR;
I Have heere sent you an Itali∣an plant, trans∣lated to an Eng∣lish platte: whose flower will not appeare halfe so delightfull

to your Smelling, as the fruit will become  for preser∣ving. You shall here meet with an Author walking in an un∣beat path. One, who discurtains the vices of that Time so smoothly, though smartly, as his continued Allegorie pleads his Apologie. A right Italian wit shal your Honor find him, quick & spritely: & of eminent race and ranke in his Country. And it is my joy, to addresse a Worke so richly interveined with straines of wit and iudge∣ment, to one, whom descent and desert have equally en∣nobled; and who with so

cleare and discerning a spirit can iudge of it. Now, if this new dresse doe not become him, all that I can say in mine owne defence is this, and no other; there is great difference be∣twixt Taylor and Transla∣tor: Sure I am, that the Loome is the same, if not the Lustre; the Stuffe the same, though not the Colour: where∣in Hee freely appeales to your Censure, who hath profest himselfe
Your Honours in duest observance,
RI. BRATHWAIT.
