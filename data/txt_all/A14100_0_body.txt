WALKING in this vale of Miserie, chec∣ked with the choa∣kynge cares of this mortall life, mated with the manifolde calamities whereunto the whole po∣steritie of our first Father Adam is subiect: I finde nothing (right honou∣rable my good Lorde, and Lady) wher∣in
the hart of man can take more quiet and cast foorth a surer anker of stabi∣litie to ride salfe from the vncertaine surges of this wicked worlde, or enter into a calmer Hauen: then into the vndoubted harbour, and comfortable porte of Praier. Heerein, although wee bee neuer so mutche tossed with troubles, weeried with vexations, af∣frighted with afflictions, pinched with paines, oppressed with miseries, girded with greifes, and slayne with persecutions: yet wee may finde assu∣red releife, certaine succour, constant comfort, and speedie deliuerance. And no meruell. For although it sumtimes so vnhappely fall out, that eeuen the most expert and wisest Mariners, when they haue attayned the Rode after boysterous stormes on th' open sea, thin∣kyng themselues then past all daunger, are notwithstanding cast a way in the Hauen: yet in the midst of our mise∣ries, and very depth of our daungers,
if wee turne aboute the helme of our contemplations, and arriue once with in this Rode: wee neede to feare no foule weather, wee weigh no Shippewracke, wee dreade no drowninge. The flittinge of our barke, may aptly represent our distracted conscience: the Cable thereof, our Faith, the Anker, frute of good woorkes fast linked to the same: the Ankeradge, is Christe our sauiour: on whom if our cable do strike, and our Anker take holde: the grounde neuer fayleth vs, for it is a firme rocke, it yeeldeth not at the rage of winde nor weather, for it is not setled vpon the sand. In sutch like sort, it pleased sumtime our sweet Sa∣uiour, the diuine wisdom of God the fa¦ther, by grosse and base terme to figure himself, the better to bee conceaued by our blinded vnderstanding, that know¦yng the nature and disposition of the thing: wee might likewise in all our troubles and afflictions stay, and re∣pose

and our praier to bee effectuall. Then shal wee feele immediatly a woonder∣ful operation of the holy ghost within our hartes, assuryng vs of the greate, and tendre mercie of God towards vs, wherin wee are eftsoones emboldned to crie vnto him, Abba father, thy wil bee doone in earth as it is in hea∣uen. This is the meanes whereby the auntient heroicall personages of the olde testament beecame, as it were, fa∣miliar with God. For by this hee was felt in a combat of wrestlyng al night seene in the burnyng busshe, heard in a calme after a windie tempest, and dayly cōmuned withall in the mount. By faithfull praier, God preserueth the righteous in the true way, bringeth backe sutche as goe astray, stayeth vp those that stande, helpeth vp sutche as fall, comforteth the weake consciēce, lighteneth the sorowfull hart, chee∣reth the heauie, refressheth the laden, erecteth the afflicted from the deepe
dungeon of blacke desperation, and crowneth him with immortallitie.
I neede not in this place to call now to recorde the priuie experimentes, & triall herein of many other men, since that I my poore self, for the short time that God hath led foorth my daies in this life, haue most sharpely tasted the sower of th' one, and most comfortably tried the sweete of the other. Not that I haue bin a great eye sore vnto Fortune, as wee daily see there bee di∣uerse, as by her greeuously enuied at, assaulted, beaten, cast downe, troden, spurned, driuen to dust, consumed to no thing, for I neuer possessed the occa∣sion of any sutch storming casualities. Yet in my slendre Boate hath shee ship¦ped her bitter Oare, shee hath blowne a contrarie gale in my hoysed saile, shee hath soused my Suger with Salt, and seasoned my sweete Syrup with vnpleasant Aloes, shee hath frow∣ned vpon my felicitie, and doone hir
best to bring mee to nought, and now shee triūpheth for the victorie, wher to I must of force haue yeelded, had I not sustained my selfe only with this most worthy benefite, wherby I haue bin sufficiently instructed how to estee me the frownings, or fawnings of this wicked world. As for the vse of Praier it is expedient in our youth: and ne∣cessarie in our olde age. By this the poore wretches doo tollerate their neede, and the ritche obtaine power to enioy their wealth. Both the prince and the subiect, whatsoeuer bee the puisance of the one, or the condicion of the other: haue continuall neede of recourse vnto praier, wherby they be∣come humble sueters to th'omnipotent God in respect of their imperfections and vnrighteousnesse, wherin he hath included the sunnes of men as witnes∣seth S. Iohn, saying: If wee say that wee haue no sinne: wee deceaue our selues, and there is no trueth in vs.
 And Iob likewise speaketh of all men in his owne person: If I will iustefie my selfe, mine owne mouthe shall condemne mee: If I will bee a per∣fect man, God shall prooue mee a wicked doer: and also in another place, he fitly layth foorth the mise∣ries of our nature, where hee saith: Man that is borne of a woman hath but a short date of life, and is reple∣nished with many miseries. The se∣crete assaultes whereof, when they shall, as dayly they doo, with remorse of conscience, withdraw your honou∣rable personages a while from th' ac∣customable conuersation in ordinarie affayres, priuatly to professe your guilt, and hartely to humble your sel∣ues beefore the maiestie of God, with feruent affection in lowly praier: if you shall take into your handes this litle booke, which I haue termed a Garland, eftsoones selecting some one or two
Flowers therein contained, as
occasion shall serue from your pro∣founder meditations: I doo not distrust, but that haply your honours may con∣ceaue sum sutche sootenesse of sauour therin, as shall not offend your sense, mutchlesse the maiestie of God, as to the good liking of the one, and the glory of the other: I haue bin so bold to im∣ploy the small trauaile of gathering these few Flowers into order of your honourable names, and to offre them vnto you, knitting them vp in one
Garland, expressing therby, as was mine endeuor, the absolute circle of commendable Graces and Vertues, apparant to the world, iointly couched in your Right honourable persons.
A most certain president wherof may bee, the one of you by our most prudent Prince, doubtlesse at the secret motion of GOD, raysed vnto sutch highnesse in Honour as match with the best, in∣feriour to none: I neede seeke for no farther occasions of commendation, or
auntient titles of worship or honour, the siluered heares giuing euident to∣ken of the golden wit, and the honou∣rable age▪ of the verteous forepassed life, and the many yeres of the blessing of the most highest God. On th' other side bewtified with a louing Lady, the of∣springe of an excellent race, Nice to rightwoorship full Grandsiers, daugh∣ter to a woorthy Knight, Schollar to a learned scholemaister, Sister to a right honourable Lady, Moother of mutch hoped impes, Aunt to a peerelesse coū∣tesse, Wife to a noble Counseller, La∣die of a Godly Famely, Subiect to a lo∣uinge Prince, a trewe woorshipper of Almightie God. Vnto whose good pleasure, for the prolonging and con∣tinuance of both your liues in increse of godlie Honour, and all other de∣lightes apperteininge, whereby the race of this transitorie life may bee made lesse irksome to the bodie, or pre∣iudiciall to the soule: I am bownden
dayly to pray, the effect whereof hee graunte, who tendreth our iust re∣questes, and is the only giuer of all goodnesse.
At London
this first day of Ianuarie. 1574.
