Right Noble Sir,
IF I may be bold to looke so high, I dare looke no high∣er, then your selfe in this my Dedi∣cation; were I able to bring forth a birth worthy of a higher counte∣nance, to whom should I present it, but vnto my gracious Lord of Pembroke, Nostri hujus saecu∣li miraculum, I am sure, Reipub∣licae sustentaculum, vnto whom in spem veni, for earthly encourage∣mēts. But I neuer yet could so ouer∣weene

my owne abilities, as to think their fruits worthy of such a patro∣nage. And I must deale plainly with you, I am altogether time∣rous, (if not a little presumptuous) to shrowde your Honours name in the forhead of such vnliterate lines; yet since that not onely your Noble desires for my good, but also your intensiue & extensiue exhibition of more then common loue, doe iustly challenge some testification of thank∣fulnesse (without which I might rightly incurre Claudius Caesars censure vpon ingratitude) therefore Ingratos reuocauit in seruitu∣tem. Sueton. instead of a better acknowledge∣ment, I dedicate this poore widowes mite, this formlesse first borne issue, and in that my selfe, my best deuo∣ted seruice to your noble protection. I remember what Socrates did re∣ply to Aeschines his schollar, when being poore he tooke it to heart that he was not able to gratifie him in a more ample manner, An non in∣telligis

quam magnum munus mihi dedisti? nisi forte teipsum parui aestimas; Doest thou not know (saith his Master) how great a gift thou hast giuen mee? belike thou accountest thy selfe lit∣tle worth. Implying that hee ac∣counted his gift (though poore) more precious than theirs who were rich; because (though his gift was but very small) yet he cast in all that he had; Likewise it is granted that there is no proportion betweene such a seeming something, such a lesse then nothing as this, and the great loue & obseruance which you haue condignlie merited at my hands; Yet seeing the Moralist tells mee, that where onely the qualitie of the affection and not the quantity of the present is to bee attended: Modi∣cum non differt à magno, it skils not whether the present bee great or small, so that your affection may alwaies rest beyond desert, and

gracious acceptance, farre excee∣ding expectation, in which hope resting, I craue leaue for writing, and take leaue of writing: praying God to blesse you still in this life, and to crowne you with blessednesse it selfe in the life to come.
