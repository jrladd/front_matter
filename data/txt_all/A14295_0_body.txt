MAdame, when I had ferre∣ted through euerie nooke of my Muses poore treasurie, to find some present worthy your acceptaunce, J coulde finde none so fitte, as this little Treatise of health, whose happie continuance, with faire increase of yeares, and plenteous fruitfulnesse, I haue euer wished you; that as the dewe of heauen hath sent forth the

bud of your tender age sweete, vertuous, and right worthie of the noble roote, from whence it sprang: so the sunne shine of grace will ripen those excellent blossomes to perfection. The first occasion, which made me fall into this kinde of studie, was the necessarie regard of mine owne health; necessarie I call it in diverse respects: for when sorrow and discontentment had al∣most dryed and stifled vp my vitall spi∣rites (the reasons whereof are not alto∣gither to you vnknowne) and driuen mee to this dolefull exigent, that I doubted, which were better eyther to be, as then I was, or not to be at all: at the last, Reason and Religion forced mee to take this course, least despaire should ouerwhelme the na∣turall and purer faculties of my soule. Now, since the length and processe of time by fauour of the great Prince of Hierar∣chies, hath somewhat enlarged and forti∣fied

my spirites, I haue sent you no other Physicke, then what I my selfe applied, wi∣shing, that it may lie by you without occa∣sion of vse, euen so long, that the leaues may lacke renewing, before you lacke health.
Whereto although it may be, that some close and subtell-headed petifogger may except, yea, and sue my conceipt in the Ex∣chequer of his owne opinion, in that I pro∣testing sayth to Iustinian, doe enter league with Galen,, and studying the Ciuill law, doe vndertake to meddle with Naturall and Artificiall experiments: yet my plea shall bee drawne from a principall Maxime in Nature, namely, that my health is of more consequence with me, then my Clientes case, and my friendes beeing well more reioyceth me, then the worlds be∣ing rich. But how can you doe amisse (deare sister) for whom such carefull pa∣rents,

and such a circumspect husband, haue so carefully and circumspectly proui∣ded? How can you (for whom Nature, Fortune, and worship, haue, like vnto the Poets three Goddesses, reserued the golden ball) how can you, I say, want all health, and happinesse, which this earth affoordes? Nay, more, how is it possible, that you ha∣uing made your selfe hitherto deare to God (as appeares by his wonderfull bene∣fites on you bestowed) by your vertuous conuersation in the verie Aprill of your yeares, be without the sauing health of ioy and glorie from aboue? What Direction neede you to respect, that are entered the right path? Truly, my prayers are, that you may proceed forward still in that way, but yet that you may bee lang in going; both that I may long enioy part of your felicitie, and also that other Ladies of the like sympathie of naturall inclination may

take president from your example.
It greatlie befitteth your vertuous and ingenuous nature to reioice in the blessings of the Lorde so inestimable; as first, in your noble minded father, that famous Knight, sir Gelly Meiricke, (who for integritie of life, prudence, magnanimitie, and liberall behauiour, is inferiour to no man of what qualitie soeuer): and no lesse in the ioy∣ning with such an Husband, whom bro∣therly regarde of modestie forbiddeth me to extoll with praises according to de∣serts. And when the thirde blessing by the fauourable permission of one and the same God shall betide you, euen the propa∣gation of children, as blooming vines round about your table, with both your powers equallie endued to your earthlie comfort: J know not to whome J may say, that the type and title of equall happinesse hath beene graunted more then vnto you.

But leauing these, and whatsoeuer other blessings it hath pleased the supreame Gi∣uer of all goodnesse, to raine downe vpon you, as vpon a gratefull and fertill soile: my onelie purpose and intent is to request you (Madame) to patronize, and receiue with good liking, this pamphlet of mine, fraught with Naturall and Artificial Directions, as vndertaken for the health of all: so especiallie consecrated vnto your sutable tuition and seruice in particular, not so much (I protest) in regarde of anie your vr∣gent neede, through anie distemperature, which I know; as to prescribe vnto you a dietarie plat-forme, whereby you may keepe backe all such griefes, as might per∣case steale vpon you here after, before you be aware: withall assuring my selfe, that in the often reading thereof, you shall get a trea∣surie stored with pretious Margarites, Rubies, and Diamonds; and in the vsing

of it, you shal find comfortable medicines, to prolong your life. Which the first and eter∣nall Breather of life confirme and furnish with religious ornaments, and necessarie complements thereto belonging, while it remaineth in this earthlie mould; and after death make you partaker of those trium∣phant and euer-during ioyes, which before the foundation of the worlde his Diuine Maiestie hath prepared for his Godlie and adopted children.
 From Iesus Colledge in Oxford, the first day of April, Anno Domini, 1600, Your louing Brother,
