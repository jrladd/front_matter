Honoured Sir,
THough at first it was free, and in my choice, whether or no I should publish these Discourses, yet the Publication being once Resolved, the De∣dication was not so indifferent; the Nature of the Subject, no less than the Obligations of the Author, styling them in a peculiar manner Yours: For since their drift is to carry the most Endangered, and Endanger∣ing Truth, above the Safest, when sinfull, Interest; as a Practice upon grounds of Reason the most Generous, and of Chri∣stianity the most Religious; to whom ra∣ther should this Assertion repair as to a Pa∣tron, then to Him whom it has for an in∣stance?
VVho in a case of eminent compe∣tition chose Duty before Interest, and when the Iudge grew inconsistent with the Iustice, prefered rather to be Cōstant to sure Prin∣ciples, than to an Vnconstant Government: And to retreat to an innocent and Hono∣able privacy, then to sit and Act iniquity by a Law; and make your Age and Con∣science, (the one Venerable, the other Sacred Drudges to the tyranny of Fanatick, Perju∣red Vsurpers. The next attempt of this Dis∣course is a Defence of the Ministery, and that at such a time when none owned them upon the Bench (for then you had quitted it) but when on the contrary we lived to hear one in the very face of the Vniversity, as it were in defiance of us and our Profession openly in his Charge defend the Quakers and Fanaticks, persons not fit to be nam'd in such Courts, but in an Indictment. But, Sir, in the Instructions I here presumed to give to others, concerning what they should do, you may take a narrative of what you have done: what respected their Actions as a Rule or Admonition, applyed to yours
is only a Rehearsal, whose Zeal in asserting the Ministerial Cause is so generally known, so gratefully acknowledged, that I dare af∣firme, that in what I deliver, you read the words indeed of One, but the Thanks of All. VVhich affectionate Concernment of yours for them, seems to argue a Spirituall sence, and experimentall Tast of their VVorks, and that you have reaped as much from their Labours, as others have done from their Lands: For to me it seemed alwaies strange, and next to Impossible, that a man converted by the word Preached, should ever hate and persecute a Preacher. And since you have severall times in discourse declared your self for that Government in the Church, that is founded upon Scripture, Reason, Apostolicall Practice and Antiquity, and (we are sure) the only one that can consist with the Present Government of State, I thought the latter Discourse also might fitly addresse it self to you, in the which you may read your Iudgment, as in the other your Practice. And now since it has pleased Pro∣vidence, at length to turn our Captivity, and
answer persecuted Patience with the unex∣pected returns of Settlement; to remove our Rulers, and restore our Ruler; and not onely to make our Exactors righteous∣nesse, but what is better, to give us Righ∣teousnesse instead of Exaction, and hopes of Religion to a Church worried with re∣formation; I believe upon a due and im∣partiall Reflexion on what is past, you now find no cause to Repent, that you never dipt your hands in the Bloody High Courts of Justice, properly so called only by Antiphrasis; nor ever prostituted the Scar∣let Robe to those Employments, in which you must have worne the Colour of your Sin in the Badge of your Office: but notwith∣standing all the Enticements of a Prospe∣rous Villany, abhorred the purchase, when the price was Blood. So that now being priviledged by an happy Vnconcernment in those legall murders, you may take a sweet∣er relish of your own Innocence, by behold∣ing the misery of others Guilt, who being Guilty before God, and infamous before men, Obnoxious to both, begin to find the
first fruits of their sin in the Vniversal scorn of all, their apparent Danger, and unlikely Remedy: which beginnings being at length consummated by the hand of Justice, the cry of Blood and Sacriledge will cease, mens doubts will be Satisfied, and Provi∣dence Absolved.
And thus, Sir, having presumed to ho∣nour my first Essayes in Divinity, by pre∣fixing to them a Name, to which Divines are so much obliged; I should here in the close of this Address, contribute a VVish at least to your Happiness: But since we de∣sire it not yet in another VVorld, and your Enjoyments in this (according to the Stan∣dard of a Christian desire) are so compleat, that they require no Addition; I shall turn my VVishes into Gratulations, and congratulating their fulness only wish their Continuance: Praying that you may still possess what you possess; and Doe what you Doe; that is reflect upon a clear, un∣blotted, acquitting Conscience, and feed upon the ineffable Comforts of the Memo∣rial of a Conquered temptation; without
the danger of returning to the Tryall. And this (Sir) I account the greatest felicity that you can enjoy, and therefore the great∣est that he can desire, who is
