THe sundry beames proceeding from one Sunne,
The hiue where many Bees their honey bring,
The Sea, to which a thousand riuers runne,
The garden where suruiues contiuall spring,
The Trophee hung with diuers painfull hands,
Abstract of knowledge, Briefe of Eloquence,
Aiding the weake, preseruing him that stands:
Guide to the soule, and ruler of the sense.
Such is this Volume, and the fraight hereof,
How-euer ignorance presume to scoffe.
