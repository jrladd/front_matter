Illustrious and Right Noble MADAME;
TWO speciall reasons embolden, or
rather oblige mee to expose this
Translation to the common view,
under your Gracious patronage; The
one is, because its Originall was by
the Authour composed at the com∣mand
of that Worthy Pillar of this
State, your deceased Duke of blest memory, under whose
princely tutelage it also boldly presented it self to the pub∣like
eye, so as it was chiefly beholding to that renowned
Peere for both it's life and being: The other, that this Ero∣mena,
though a Princesse, yet necessitated (for being an
alien borne) to implore a protection in this Monarchall

Ile, comes now, as well to expresse to your Grace the
greatnesse of her obligation to the honoured memory of
that noble Peere, for having so courteously protected her
in Italy, as also to sue for and request the further continu∣ance
of a like favour (here in this Ile) at the hands of
your Illustrious Grace, who are the now remaining part
of that divinely composed piece of Excellency, whereof he
was the residue; which (considering your known noble
demerits, and princely courtesie) shee hopes to obtaine,
for that fame hath assured her, that your Grace is as well
a Patronesse of Vertue, as patterne of Honour, especially
finding them so innately habituall, and so constantly per∣manent
in that Sex, and therewithall in a Princesse, their
choisest seat of residence: Vouchsafe then (Right Excel∣lent
Lady) that my obligation to obey so meriting a Prin∣cesse,
may excuse my boldnesse in ushering her Excellencie
in reall perfections so excelling, into so excellent a presence
as that of your Graces; Where with all submissive and
reverent respects I leave her to apologize (as I am perswa∣ded
her no way defective heroicall goodnesse will) in ex∣cuse
of my necessitated boldnesse; whilest I (wishing that
she prove as capable and fortunate, as (I am confident)
she is both desirous and zealous to manifest her two-fold
obligement to so highly-deserving a Patronesse) with your
gracious benigne permission, submissively kissing your
Princely hands, with all respective humblenesse retire
my selfe.
