My Lord,
THe Parliament having lately graciously considered
my humble Suit and long patience? (and I, by the
refreshment thereby obtained, getting some leisure
to entertain my naturall Genius) an earnest De∣sire
immediately possest me to perform somwhat,
which might shew me thankful to God, and to those friends,
by whose Mercy, I and my Family have been preserved, from
perishing under our late Pressures; and he who wrought that
Desire in me, offered therewith to my thought, an Under∣taking
sutable to my inclination; with hope, that he would
inable to the perfecting thereof in due season, though inter∣ruptions
will be many, and the time, whereto I must confine
my self, very short.
The Supreme Authority hath enacted a publique Thanks∣giving
throughout this Common wealth, on the thirtieth of
this January (being the last day of the late Kings life, as
also the first of Englands resuming her long lost Liberty)
a Day, which may by good reason be made an everlasting An∣niversary,
in remembrance of that, and other great Delive∣rances.
And, therefore I thought it would neither be an
impertinent expression of my Gratitude, nor unacceptable
where I owe it, to prepare proper Hymnes for that daies Ce∣lebration,
with some other brief Commemoration, to keep
in mind GODS late Mercies to this Republique, when that
daies solemnity shall be forgotten; and thereupon composed
(among other assaies, yet unfinished) the three following
Hymnes, which I thus communicate, before the perfe∣cting
of what is further intended; in hope it may be a means

to prepare the hearts of some for a more due observation of
that Day, by giving them space to consider, how pertinent
they are to the duty then required; and that they may be
thereby in readinesse for those who shall be willing to make
use of such helps to Devotion.
Hymnes are so proper to publique acknowledgements of
extraordinary Deliverances, and Mercies (spirituall, or tem∣porall)
that by the Primitive Churches, Jewish and Chri∣stian,
they were this way commemorated, and left upon re∣cord
even to this day; as appears in Holy Writ, by the Hymns,
Songs, and Psalms, of Moses, Deborah, Hannah, David,
Esay, Hezekiah, Simeon, Zachary, and Mary, with others.
The practise also of Christian Churches, in, and after the
Apostles time, makes it evident, that they sung Hymnes and
Songs upon the severall occasions, happening from time to
time. And though Scorners, and ignorant persons do in this
Age vilisie, or contemn the gift of Poesie; yet the most know∣ing,
and most pious, among all Nations, have alwaies pra∣ctised,
and do still approve the use of that Faculty, to rouze
up spirituall affections in the soul, toward the illustrating
of Gods Praises: and they who dispise it, are dispisers of
that Gift, which God hath given for his own glory, with
our advantage: For, it is none of those accomplishments,
which may be acquired by meer human industry, (though it
may be much better'd thereby) but is one of Gods Peculiars,
and infused in the mothers womb, as is generally con∣fessed
by learned and understanding men, many of which
have long studied for it in vain, by meer helps of Art.
Upon these considerations, and by the example of many
Prophets and Poets, (for in some other languages, one word
signifies both) who very well knew that advanta∣ges
may be made by the right use of that Faculty, upon
such occasions of praise as have been vouchsafed to this
Nation; I have thereby sought to illustrate Gods Mer∣cies;
with an assurance, that it shall prepare the hearts of
many, to a more cheerfull performance of what is comman∣ded,
and help to charm down those distempers which trou∣ble
the Common Peace, and hinder our reconcilement, both
to God, and to each other; and I hope it will not seem Ar∣rogance
in me to offer them to that use.
For, though it be no rare thing to see many run on er∣rants
before they are sent; and to obtrude their undigested

Conceptions upon publique Auditories; yet private persons,
qualified by their Education, Conversation, and Gifts, may
with modesty and submission make tender of that which they
conceive edifying; yea, and ought, (as I think) so to do, their
consciences perswading it to be their duty: because I find
it was a Liberty, Apostolically allowed, and taken for
private Christians to communicate their severall Gifts in
publique Congregations; and that he who brought a Hymn,
brought that which was acceptable, as appears in that place,
where the Apostle prescribes what Order is to be observed
at such Meetings. According to that approved practise, I
offer the ensuing Hymnes, composed and fitted to the Meri∣dian
of vulgar capacities; and yet (I hope) not so inartifi∣cially
composed, as to make them despised of the learned. I
have also out of such tunes as the people are acquainted with∣all,
chosen those which are best sutable to the matter and occa∣sion,
sitting the first Hymn to a strain, beseeming the begin∣nings
of Exultation: The second, to higher straines of
rejoycing, and the last to the fulnesse of praisefull
Thanksgivings; all which I humbly submit to your grave
Censure.
And I dedicate, and first send them to your Lordship, for
many good Reasons. First, by your approbation of their use∣fullnesse,
I shall be the more comfortably confirmed in that
hope which I have thereof already. Secondly, your exempla∣ry
respect may make others perhaps take the more heed of
them; and by growing acquainted with them for your sake,
respect them afterward for their own. Thirdly, you were
one of the most eminent personall instruments under God, of
that Justice upon which the many Mercies followed, which
are the subject of these Hymns; and I thought they would be
the more acceptable unto you, in regard no man had been in
greater danger, if God, by not appearing for us, had per∣mitted
our Adversaries to prevail. Lastly, an Obligation
lies upon me, to give you some visible testimony of my thank∣fullnesse
for benefits conferred.
For, Sir, notwithstanding it offends your modesty, to hear
me make offers of acknowledgements, (though it be in pri∣vate)
yet I will now take the boldnesse to tell it openly,
that, if God by his compassion, moving in the heart of your
Lordship, and one other Noble Friend, (whose modesty hath
likewise yet stopt my mouth) had not freely vouchsafed supplies

during my late streights, I and my Family, (considering in
what hazzard all my other hopes then lay) had, in probabi∣lity,
long since been quite ruined, or exposed to most despica∣ble
wants; as would be manifest, if the circumstances of my
suffering should be fully declared, and I should not now per∣haps
have had courage enough in me to have composed
these Hymnes, or to have sung a joyfull song in the Land of
the Living, this day.
They are, therefore, not so much mine, as yours, and his;
Take them therefore at your own, and with them my prayers,
that God would return your mercies a thousand fold into
your bosomes, And make them comfortable unto you, both all
the daies of your lives, and at the hours of your death. I
have nothing else to retribute but Prayers, except it be by
adding so much to the honour of your Justice and Mercy, as
the single testimony of an honest man (never aspersed with
flattering) may confer: If that be any thing worth, I can
truly say, that I have seen you active in the most eminent
prosecution of human publiqke Justice under the Sun; and
that I am a witnesse also of your extraordinary private mer∣cy,
by being twice thereby delivered from probable destructi∣on.
Vpon contemplation whereof, I am warranted to assure
you from him who can make it good, that if you persevere
(whereof I doubt not) in your heroicall progress, all the
power, threats, and mischievous practises of your most inra∣ged
and malicious Adversaries, shal be but as fire and mate∣rialls
co-operating with better Ingredients to make refined
Gold for your immortall Crown; and that their revilings,
snarlings, and detractions, shall make it more glorious then
Diamonds, Pearls, and Rubies, & shine brighter many Ages
hence, then it can now. It shall questionlesse be so; and
therefore if ought happen hereafter, that may seem bitter to
the flesh in more then ordinary measure, or threaten any ter∣rible
event, be assured, they are but operations of that Fire
which is used in preparing the essentiall Materialls of your
expected Crown. He so presageth, whose predictions you
have seen verified in more dubious matters; and he is
also unfainedly
