MY worthy Cusing, I must to thee commend,
Him who of his Talent surely has made ten,
Like as Ioseph did in AEgypt long remain,
Whilst his Brether did for Food unto him come,
So Gideon privately did live, and made no scroup,
Whilst that his Brethren swaggred round about;
But now of Iasons Fleece he hath more store,
Than ever his Brethren had before,
This Gideon Scot he is a pretty Man,
Amongst the rest of worthy Shepherds Swain,
Of Outer-siderig now he is Laird,
He was Son to Robert of Har-wood,

Robert he was a worthy Man,
He was Son to Walter of Erckletoun,
VValter sprung from that same Stock,
That was call'd Iohn Scot of the New-wark,
And Iohn he was Iames's Son,
My sleeping Muse is now layen down,
But when she wakes out of her Dream,
The rest of's Pedegree I'le explain;
Since he and Iason is so well acquaint,
His Golden Fleeces he has to him lent.
