MIrror of Knighthood, WORTHIES Caualiere,
Touchstone of Valour, Chiefe of Chiualrie;
Honor of Field, to Foe a deadly Feare,
Wars bloody Ancient, Plague to Surquedrie:
Souldiers Reliefe, Mars brauest Coronell,
Bellonas Trumpet, Battailes Larum Bell:


Sweet to thy Friends, to Strangers nothing sower,
Whose kinde Behauiour hath bin of such force,
As ore thy deadliest Foes, th'hast had great power,
Making them learne true Pitie and Remorse.
Witnes the sauadge KERNS, and IRISH wilde,
Wrought through thy Cariage sweete, both tame and milde.


Vertue and Honor, striue in thee t'exceede;
Valour and Beautie, Intrest in thee claime,
Whilst thou thy Noble House noblest indeede,
Thy House, not thee, through thy Palme-rising Fame.
Worthy art thou to be (Faire matchle Wight)
MINION to Kings to Queenes, deare FAVORITE.



Then (Courteous KNIGHT) vouchsafe with cheerfull smile,
This wofull Verse (though worthles) to accept:
Begot by Griefe, brought forth as Sorrowes Childe,
Since Thee and Thine (as Sacred) I respect.
Ah had mine ALBA seene thy louely Face,
For thy sweet sake, I (then) had found some Grace.
