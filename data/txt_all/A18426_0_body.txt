SIR, if any worke of this nature be worth the presenting to Friends Worthie, and Noble; I presume this, will not want much of that value. Other Countrie men haue thought the like worthie of Dukes and Princes acce∣ptations; Iniusti sdegnij; Il Pentamento Amorose; Calisthe, Pastorfido, &c. (all being but plaies) were all dedicate to Princes of Italie. And therefore only discourse to shew my loue to your right vertuous and noble disposition; This poor Comedie (of many desired to see printed) I thought not vtterly vnworthie that affectionate designe in me: Well knowing that your free iudgement weighs nothing by the Name, or Forme; or any vaine estimation of the vulgar; but will accept acceptable matter, as well in Plaies; as in many lesse materialls, masking in more serious Titles. And so, till some worke more worthie I can select, and per∣fect, out of my other Studies, that may better expresse me; and more fit the grauitie of your ripe inclination, I rest.
