SIR,
I Did suffer at the first some contention with∣in me, and looking upon my self, was inclined to stifle my ambitious thoughts in this Dedi∣cation; but when some time, and a happy con∣versation, had preferred me to more acquaintance with you, (which was more argument to me, than the fame I had heard of your reputation, with the most temperate and ingenious men) I found you not only an excellent Judge, but a good Man: at this my modesty took full encouragement, to make this offering, which as I conceive to be the best of my flock, I knew not a better Altar whereon to make it a sacrifice, with this protestation, that it comes (and that is it only, which makes all devoti∣ons
acceptable) from the heart, and your candid acceptance will bind me with all my services, and remembrance, to merit a reception with you, in the quality and honour of,
Sir,
