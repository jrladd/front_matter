My Lord,
THe Publisher of this Discourse has no other motive of his Address to your Lordship, than that the Design may receive Protection from some Powerful Hand, by which being Shelter'd in its Infancy from the blasts of Malevolence (which will blow from more corners than one) it may have leave to strike Root and grow to strength e∣nough to be able to stand alone. The Subject Matter seems to belong to your Lordship in Propriety as you are Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; and the Patronage of so Noble and National a Project cou'd be claim'd no where so rightfully as from your Lordship, who being e∣qually great by Birth, Power, the Favour of your Prince and the Love of your Country; I cou'd not withstand the Iustice of making this Oblation of my Duty and Good wishes to your Lordship, by thus tendering it to your Election to be the Father and Protectour of so Needful and Magnificent a Work, abounding in Publick Honour, Safety and Emolument; whereby you may consign your Name to Posterity, by a Monument more durable and of greater dignity than the Records and Patents of your Ancestors or the Statues of Antiquity.
The Manuscript fell casually into my hands during the last Session of Parliament, which being relish'd by such Worthy Members of that Honourable Body as I had an Opportunity to impart it to; I thought I could not do a more Grateful Office to my Country, than to be the means of its Publication, for which freedom I ask the Authors pardon, as I do your Lordship's for the presumption of this Dedication: who am,
Your Lordship's most Humble and Dutiful Servant,
