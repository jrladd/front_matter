SIR, I present this my Sermon vnto you, and place your worthy name in the fore∣frōt thereof; thereby to shew my respectiue loue vnto you, & to let you vnderstand; that if there be any fault committed in the publishing ther∣of; that you ought to beare a great portion of the blame, who haue bin (amongst very many others) earnest. with mee to afford it publike attire. If the Pon ifi∣cians be distasted therewith, they may in some part thanke them selues; some of them haue beene too cla∣mourous out of the relation either of ignorant, male∣uolent, or semi-popish hearers, in rumoring the same, to haue beene but a rouing discourse, sometimes ouer∣learned; somewhiles vnlcarned; but alwaies very bit∣ter against the Papists; so bitter, that in it, I branded all those of that sect and heresic (excepting none what∣soeuer) with the vile marke of disloyalty & traiterous spirits. In consideration whereof, I was easier induced to let it see light, and in so publike a habit to vndergoe all censures: and (to giue thereader some satisfaction) this also the rather, because through confuse noises, and clatterings, of voices, and of dores (my selfe, stay∣ing not lesse then a whole houre in an open pew, be∣fore the deliuery of my Sermon;) the recollection of my memory was then somewhat confused: so that, for that cause, and through want of time also, I did not,
 nor could not pronounce all thereof, so fully, and in that sort as I intended it. The scope thereof (kind Sir) being briefly and contractly (not intended for so publike, and so honourable an assembly) to delineat the inestimable perfections and dignities of Christ; to perswade all my Auditours to a sincere and most zea∣lous affiance for saluation in his onely blood: to most assured loyalties to their Prince, and Countrey, and to a detestation against all Popsh, Ignatian, bloody, and sanguineous attempts, against the state of this Church and Countrey: I doe not know any one of your wor∣thy ranke and calling, to whom a discourse of this kind would prooue more acceptable, more welcome. Make acceptance of it (Sir) therefore, with that loue and respect, with which it is sent; and doe mee this fauour, that if you heare any semi-papists, or anie that are leaning that way, or any other, doubtfullie to coniecture or surmise, whether my cnuersion bee from the heart or not; or for hope of preferment, to speake as you haue heard, as you thinke, and perfectlie know of mee: for you know, and knew from the begin∣ning, from whom my encouragements haue beene; from God; from Iesus Christ: whose name therefore, be euer magnified and blessed; to whose blessings, and gratious fauours, I commend both you and yours, for euer.
From my chamber, this 28. of Aprill, 1612.
