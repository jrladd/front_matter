R Remembring how a Persian poore presented to his King,
O Of water cleare in homely handes from out the sprouting Spring:
B Because the King wel vnderstood, how Zeale in Gyuers thought,
E Exceeded far the simple Gift, the seelie Geeuer brought:
R Receiued it in gracious part, and thankeful was therfore,
T That such as greater Gyfts did gyue, of ThaÌ„ks deseru'd no more.


L Likewise (my Lord) with this poore gift your Honor I present:
E Example of the Persian Prince, I trust shal moue content.
Y Your Honors Bountie towardes mee, more then I heere confesse.
C Compelleth mee in humble sort my dutie to expresse.
E Esteeme therfore (my Right good Lord, the valour of the mynd:
S So as the Geeuer shal deserue your Fauour for to fynde.
T The Lord of Lords and King of Kings, vnder whose might we be,
E Encrease your Honor & your health, good dayes and yeres to see
R Remember yet among the rest, that Death wyl haue his fee.
