Cleanser, clearer, and avoyder of the most Turpitudi∣nous, Merdurinous, excrementall offals, Muck and Garbadge. Refiner, Purger, Clarifier, Purifier, Mundi∣fier, Excluder, and Expulser of Putrifactious and Pesti∣ferous Contagions; the Potentissimo, Excellentissi∣mo, Invader, Scatterer, Disperser, Consumer and Con∣founder of offensive unsavoury savours, smels, scents, and vapours: Great Soldan, Sultan, and Grand Signiour over all varieties of stinks and stinkards; most Trium∣phant Termagant, unresistable Conquerour and Com∣mander of the major and minor (the great and the lesse) Turditanians, chiefe Corigidor and Beadle of all the Pre∣cinct, sole Transplanter, Terrifier, Controler, and Cor∣rector

The terrible Hue and Cry Cryer, chiefe Court Cryer, Jayle-Keeper, and onely confiner of the Hogs; chiefe and most frequent vigilant Watchman, demy Constable, and Image of Au∣thority, the most accomplished Cobler, exquisite Transla∣ter, and exact Reformer of oppressed, decayed, wicked and oppressed seales: And the onely justiciary rectifier, un∣derlayer and setter upright of such Brethren and Si∣sters, as doe go aside, and tread their foot awry in these dayes of vanity, and paths of iniquity: In hope (Great Sir) I have not abated you of the least tittle of your Title, your Honorable stile being so high, that no Christian, Pagan, Heathen, Turke, Jew, Infidell, Cuckold or Can∣niball, can never climbe to the top of it, there being a late report that your multiplicity and many affaires of State have distarbed your rest, and impaired your health, insomuch as it is thought your pericranion is crazed or cracked, and you thereby in danger to fall into a Callen∣turian disease, which is to be doubted may produce a Ver∣tigo in your head, whereby your wit may be troubled with a superfluous flax, which may prove a molestation to your selfe, and the whole Towne, that hath in it selfe, and in every place round about it, more troubles then they can well beare. But if their hard fortune should be, that when you are working to your owne Ends, and that you should call for your Aule, and Death should mistake and

bring you your Last, whereby such a privy member as your selfe might be publickly lost; it is feared, griefe would overflow the whole Towne, and that some of the Townesmen (with the helpe of their Wives) would runne starke horne mad: To prevent this great detriment of such a losse as that Towne may undergo in this time of scarcity of wit, wisdome, and wise men; for feare you should fall into the dangerous diseases of the Mubble∣fubbles, or the grumbling in the Gizzard: Therefore (10 drive away dumps) and to give you some Recreation, I have made bold to present your Greatnesse with this Dedication, which if you will vouchsafe but to read and understand, and in so doing you shall do more for the Au∣hour, then he ever was, or shall do himselfe.
