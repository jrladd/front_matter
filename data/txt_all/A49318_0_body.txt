My Lord,
WHEN I was first desi∣red to make this Sermon publick, I was sensible that it wanted, and yet was afraid to entitle it to so great a Patronage; but the Know∣ledge and happy Experience I have of your noble and generous Temper, toge∣ther with the many and great Obligations I lie under from your Lordship, do not



only encourage, but oblige me to take all Opportunities of testifying the Sence I have of your Favors, and my Gratitude to the World; so that I have this to plead in excuse of my Presumption, that even Duty and Justice required this Dedication: For you have a Right and Title to all the Results of my Stu∣dies of this Nature, provided they were worthy of your Acceptance, seeing it was your Lordships Favor to which I at first ow'd these quiet and happy Oppor∣tunities of a Studious Retirement.
And that which further adds to my Obligations is this, that the Remote∣ness of the Place doth not put me beyond the Reach of that Continued Kindness, whose Influence, like that of Heaven, challenges a kind of an Ubiquity.


Upon these Accounts, my Lord, I pre∣sume to prefix so great a Name before so mean a Piece: Mean I call it, not in Respect of the Subject Matter, but as to the manner of my handling it. The Subject is great and worthy, containing the Reasons both of our Religion and Loyalty; and whatever Defects I may be otherwise guilty of in treating of them, I shall yet make this abundant Compen∣sation to the World, in propounding so great an Example of both as your Lord∣ship is, to its Imitation.
The Jews required a Sign, and the Greeks looked after Wisdom. Those Signs indeed are now ceas'd, nor is this an Age of Miracles; yet, thanks be to God, we can yet justly boast of such moral Miracles (if I may so speak) of Religi∣on and Learning as your Lordship may be justly counted.


My Lord, I shall only add my Pray∣ers to God, that the King and King∣dom, that both Church and State may be long happy in your able and faithful Councils, that Religion and Learning may long enjoy so great a Patron, and Allegiance and Loyalty may be long encouraged and promoted by such a great and eminent Example, and remain,
My Lord,
