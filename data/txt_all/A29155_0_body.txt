Gentlemen,
I Am so many ways indebted to you, both for your obliging Election of me to be your Minister, and for the several Civilities which I have received since my living amongst you, that I could not refuse so small an acknowledgment, as that of publishing the following Discourse at your Request; tho I am not ignorant, that besides its own defects, the very subject matter of it will ex∣pose it to the Censure of some, who will not allow others the liberty to speak well of the Government, whilst they assume to themselves the priviledge of Railing at it, and speaking evil of Dignities. But since I proposed to my self no other end in it, when I delivered it from the Pulpit, than the in∣struction of my Congregation, and the discharging of a good Conscience: I am little concerned what Re∣ception it may meet with abroad, being abundantly satisfied (by the desire you have testified to have it made publick) that it has had its wish'd effect
upon You who heard it, and for whose use and advan∣tage it was primarily designed. As therefore I have consented to the Publication of it, for no other reason, but because I could not deny you the absolute dis∣posal of that which is so justly your own; so the only return that I expect or desire, is that you will go on to exemplifie it in your practice; and ap∣prove your selves in all things else, as true Friends to the Government, as you have done in your fa∣vourable acceptation of the following Discourse. That it may please God to give you frequent occa∣sions of Praises and Thanksgivings, and to per∣fect the Deliverance which he has so happily be∣gun, shall be the constant Prayer of
Decem. 4th. 1691.
