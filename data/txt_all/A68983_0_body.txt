Worthy KNIGHT,
BEing well acquainted with your true knowledge of the Honour of the Court, and the Pleasure of the Coun∣trey: your iudiciall Obseruation in your Tra∣uels abroad, and your sweet retyred Life at home: Finding my Seruice indebted to many of your vndeserued bountifull Fauours, and willing, in some fruites of my Labour, to shewe the thankfulnesse of my Loue, I haue aduentu∣red to present your Patience with a short Dis∣course, in the manner of a Dialogue, betweene a Courtier and a Countriman, touching the Liues of either: What Matter of worth is in it I will leaue to your discretion to consider of,

with my bounden Seruice to the honour of your Commaund, hoping that either heere or in the Country it will be a pretty passage of idle time, with some matter of mirth to remoue me∣lancholy. And so in Prayer for your health, and your good Ladies, to whom, with your selfe, Dedicating this short Dialogue, I rest
