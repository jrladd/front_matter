SIR,
THis Herald, whose very phrase bewraies him enough to be french, though he neuer spoke his owne french yet; and who ra∣ther chose, vpon, so vrgent a ne∣cessity, to speake ill & in a strange language, then not at all; now most rightly presents himselfe first vnto your highnes: because aswell by your merit, as by your fortune, you are one of the chiefest (if not euen the first) vpon whome he calls for the performance of the greatest, most Chri∣stian and most royall duty that euer was yeelded, to the greatest person deceased, to the greatest persons li∣ving. It is no lesse then the cause of God, no lesse then the cause of the Gods; seing, Princes are stiled so, by him that onely is so, and who, by a most excel∣lent fashion, aboue all other men, after his owne Image made them so: And what a more godly ground for all Christians to take the crosse on them, against him that vnder a gawdy show of many false crosses, the morecrossely because closely, crosseth the onely and true Crosse of Christ? Wherein, if it be not your selfe (vnder the happy auspices of your glorious father, or rather hee himselfe by you) then I see no Generall in the world, when our Christian Army must come into the field. An other reason I haue more especially and wholy to apply to your highnes, that which is intended to many; A most speciall and holy zeale to your Princely seruice, which euen eight yeares agoe, brought me into your Country, and still working in my hart, now enfor∣ces me rather to giue you a small touch ther∣of, how meane soeuer, then it should be longer hid from you, how much I am
