GReat Names, and High Titles are always attended by a Train of Suitors and Ad∣dressors; and therefore, worthy Sirs, when this Epistle Dedicatory comes to Your Hands, pray do Your Selves and Ʋs that Right, to accept it as no other than a piece of Homage to the Execu∣tors of the late Honourable Captain. Great Names did I say? Yes, Gentlemen Executors, Yours as Great as it is, is indeed but a Name. And considering what it has cost you, give me leave to rebuke the hard World you live in, for en∣vying You even that poor Feather in Your Cap, when You have almost paid as dear for the Ho∣nour, as the Court Fees for a Baronet. Nay, to have a cautioning Epistle too from Swackly, with no less Denunciation against You, than to command You to take Your High and Mighty Last Will and Testament from off the Prerogative Roll, or to answer the Refusal in Westminster Hall. Raze Your Records! Do they say! an Executor∣ship no more than an Olivers Knighthood. 'Tis

a little of the severest, my Masters. Expunge Your Title, and blot out Your Scutcheon, when 'tis all You have to shew for Your Money! However, since You have met such unkind Treatment from the rest of Mankind, we are resolved to make You some little Reparation, viz. by prefixing your Names to the History of our Deceased Heroe, as a Monu∣ment to Your Memories, which the rest of the ma∣licious World denies You.
Nay Gentlemen, considering the severity of Your hard Fortune, pray excuse our Zeal in giv∣ing You a little Advice how to retrieve Your Losses. Since you are like to be such Sufferers by Your Exe∣cutorships, e'ne recover all again by Your Overseer and Church-Wardenship. Bring in Your next Pa∣rish Bill, charg'd with such an over-grown Found∣ling laid at your Doors, and Attach the Money in Your own Hands for Nursing it.
