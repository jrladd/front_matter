Right Honourable,
THE Publishing this Discourse is purely an act of Obedience to Your Order; it being design'd to have gone no farther, than the Place in which it was Preach'd.
When You were pleas'd to come in a Body to my Church, upon so solemn an Occasion, as that of partaking of the Holy Communion, in compliance with a Law which makes the doing so a Test, to all who are admitted to Publick Offices and Em∣ployments, I thought it became me to lay hold on the Opportunity, to exhort You earnestly to promote the Good of that Church, whereof by this Practice You own Your selves to be Members.

What I have urg'd for our being (as far as is possible) united, not only in Judgment and Affe∣ction; but in Communion too, is upon such Reasons as will hold equally, where there is an In∣dulgence granted by Law, and where there is not; namely, The Precepts of the Holy Scriptures, and the Nature of the Christian Body; by both which every Christian is certainly oblig'd to promote the Peace and Unity of the Church of Christ, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake; out of regard to Christ and his Church, even where he is lyable to no Civil Mulcts or Penal∣ties for doing otherwise.
And to prevent all jealousie, as if I had the least Intention hereby to express my dislike of In∣dulgence towards tender Consciences, I take this Occasion to declare, That I heartily approve it, as being thorowly perswaded, that for one Christian to persecute another, who Conscientiously differs from him, meerly for his so doing, is a gross violation, not only of the Law of Christianity, but even of Nature it self.
Nay farther, I believe it the Duty of Church-Governours to insist upon no narrower Terms of Communion, than such as, to the best of their Judg∣ments, regulated by Scripture, have a plain and
evident tendency to maintain Truth, promote Piety and Vertue, and preserve good Order in the Churches under their Care. Which I mention with the greater freedom, because I am well satisfied that this was the Principle upon which those who settled the Reformation amongst us, in the Reign of King Edward and Queen Elizabeth, acted; and be∣cause I doubt not but that it is the Principle also of our present Governours both in Church and State.
But after this, the Duty of every private Chri∣stian is as plain; namely, to comply with the Terms establish'd, as far as he Lawfully may, valuing the Peace of the Church much beyond the gratifica∣tion of himself, and being ready to do every thing for the maintaining its Unity, which he thinks Law∣ful to be done upon any other account whatsoever.
How the Christians of this Nation came to divide themselves into so many distinct and separate Com∣munions, I will not now inquire: but till we can attain to this Disposition, I can foresee nothing else, but that our Divisions must be propagated without Reason, and without End, from one Generation to another; which is but a melancholy Thought to any one who remembers how much stress both our Saviour and his Apostles have laid upon Peace and Unity.

The Prayer which our Lord offer'd up, a little before his Suffering, for all who should believe in him, was in these words; That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; and that for this Reason, That the World may believe that thou hast sent me. And St. Paul, in a set Discourse occasion'd by Contentions in the Church of Corinth, concerning the Gifts with which some were endued to a greater degree than others, prefers Charity (meaning that Charity whereby the Peace and Unity of the Church is maintain'd) much before the best of Gifts, the strongest Faith, the most profuse Liberality, and even Martyrdom it self.
Our Blessed Saviour, as an Example to his Followers, constantly joyn'd in the Publick Exer∣cises of God's Worship, both in the Temple and in the Synagogue, notwithstanding the many and gross Corruptions which were at that time crept into the Jewish Church.
The Apostles in like manner, and the other Chri∣stians who dwelt at Jerusalem, though as they were oblig'd by the Christian Institution, they assembled apart from the Jews, for the performing that Worship which was peculiarly Christian, yet
we never find that they deserted either the Temple or the Synagogues, till the final desolation of their Country. And St. Paul himself, who so often and so vehemently, upon just occasions, asserted and pleaded for the Liberty of Christians, as being set free from the Jewish Yoke, yet did not at all scruple the making use of those Ceremonies, which himself had declar'd to be abrogated, when ever it might serve to the benefit of the Church.
After which Considerations, 'tis very strange that any Christian should entertain such slight ap∣prehensions of the Evil and Danger of dividing the Christian Church, as abundance amongst us have done.
Pardon me, if I seem to press this matter with Zeal upon You, who, under His Majesty, have the Government of this great City committed to You, and whose Examples are like to have much greater Influence than the Examples of private Men. Whatsoever others do, it certainly becomes those who are in Publick Stations, to fulfil all Righteousness; and I think I may be allow'd to say, without Offence, that a Magistrate should be one who needs no Indulgence, but that which is by common consent given to Humane Nature in general.

That whatsoever is truly and justly propos'd in the following Discourse may be of Use to the Pub∣lick, and that we may all in our respective Sta∣tions, zealously and constantly, promote the Ho∣nour of Almighty God, the Good of his Church, and the Welfare of the Kingdom, is the hearty Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
