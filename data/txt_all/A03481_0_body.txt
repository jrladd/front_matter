GReat no doubt (Right honorable) are the blowes which our aduersa∣ries the Papists haue giuen vs, and yet our Church not once moueth or giueth place to the traditions of men: But yet in this notable victory and try∣umph ouer them, we may well be compared to a company of souldiors, who hauing gotten a pray, and falling foorth amongst themselues for the diuision of it, in the meane time the enemie comes, and spoiles them all, and takes it quite from them. Wee of England haue in peace pos∣sessed
 the word of truth a long time, but about vnnecessary trifles we are readie to go together by the eares; a strange matter, that out of light should spring such palpable darknesse, and that our Ministerie should trauell as it were of sects. Well, let vs take heed, that while we thus con∣sume one another, hee take not this iewell (for which the Merchant sold all that he had to buy it) and giue it to a Nation that will bring forth the fruites thereof. Though the watchmen sitte on the tower, and tell vs daily they espie immi∣neat daungers; yea, though his preachers tell vs destruction will bee to Iuda, and desolation to Ierusalem, yet we care not for the safetie of our country, nor for the pretious Gospell which we would seeme to professe, our consciences are seared vp; and the spirite of pride hath got the dominion ouer vs, which a learned Father ma∣keth the cause of schisme and dissention.
In this little Booke (Right Honourable) I haue prescribed a potion to cure such a gree∣uous disease, the qualitie thereof you shall bet∣ter perceiue if you reade it through: and the ra∣ther I presume of your honor, for that of a child you haue beene ready to benefite the Church, beeing a father to the fatherlesse and widowe, a restorer of the Leuites portion, a defier of the world, and a chiefe defender of our Nation, that
 night and day haue beene in the perill of sea, in perill of robbers, yea sometime with Paule in peril of death and that for our safety, who liue at rest, eating the fruits of our labours in peace therefore since pouertie cannot giue to honour the thinges of this worlde, yet such as we haue with Peter that will we giue: beseeching your Honour the rather to accept of it, because it proceeded from a willing minde, and from a faithfull Northren heart, and thus I leaue it to your godly consideration, to whome our Vniuersitie is bounde in weightier matters.
