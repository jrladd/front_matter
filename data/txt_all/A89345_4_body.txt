Brother,
A Kingdome or Common∣wealth is corpus politi∣cum, consisting of many, and in themselvs disagreeing mem∣bers, but mixt and united in one Civil society by the rules of Mo∣rality; that which formes and unites this Body, is Govern∣ment,

without which it would not be a Body, but a Chaos
—rudis indigestaque moles
Non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum.
But rules of Policy and Govern∣ment are investigable by Reason, not by Sense; therefore Man only, who is animal rationale, is pro∣perly termed ; the Rea∣sonable Soul of Man runs through the whole Body of practick Philo∣sophy, teaching the duty of a good man in Ethicks, of a good Master of a Family in Oeconomicks, of a good Citizen and Magistrate in Politicks; which Duties consist in the exercise of all Moral Virtues,

especially those four Cardinal ones of Prudence, Temperance, Forti∣tude, and above all (of a Magi∣strate) that of Justice; Justice distributive, as well as commuta∣tive, without which no men of old were linked together in a Civil so∣ciety; nor at this day without it can be preserved.
And though Solomon saw an Evill, and that a great one, under the Sun, an error proceeding from the Rulers, who placed ignorance and mean persons in high Thrones, when Wisdome and Nobility sate in ipsa abiectione, whereby hap∣pily Magistracie was brought into contempt, and Justice perverted,

through the weakness or wilfulness of such Juridicials, who fall short of the perfection of those Moral Virtues, those habits of the Mind, which doe compleat a Magi∣strate; yet against such Evill our Lawes have wisely provided, That none shall bear any high Of∣fice of Magistracie, no not the Office of a Justice of Peace in the Countrey, but Plus hault & meultz vailantz, men of the best ranck and qualitie, of the best reputation, and most substantial, as Lambert hath it.
Such a one may you be in your place and calling, whose nurture and education from your youth up,

hath been in the studies of the Law, and in the study of Ethicks, as well Ethicae Christianorum as Ethicae Ethnicorum; not that Natural, onely drawn from the rules of Heathenish Philoso∣phie, but from the Fountain of Christian Divinity, which will so furnish you with all Intellectual Habits, not of Natural Virtues onely, acquired ex crebris actio∣nibus assuefactione & consue∣tudine, but of Supernatural also, infused from above, as may ren∣der you capable, and sufficient∣ly meriting those high employ∣ments unto which you are called.
Hence may you discover the ne∣cessity of this noble Science of the Soul, even for you whose conversa∣tion amongst men is Practical, and the Operations of your Soul such too, consisting in the excercise of Moral Virtues whose residence is in the Soul; the Reasonable Soul is the subject and receptacle of all Virtuous Habits acquired by Na∣ture, or infused by Grace.
Yet is there another noble Sci∣ence of the Soul, whose end is not Action, but Contemplation, or Spe∣culation of the divine Essence; this I presume is your chief study and delight, in which you spend those spare houres of retirement are gain∣ed

from your State-employments; If these my poor and weak labours may be any help and furtherance of your meditations in that kind, I freely and heartily dedicate them to you, and rest
