REmembring sir, the great good wil and vndeserued kind∣nesse which your Worship hath shewed vnto me, makes mee to thinke my self much bound vn∣to you, & so much, as if I should not by some means shew my selfe thankfull to your Wor∣ship, I might be condemned of great ingrati∣tude. Wherefore I haue thought good euen now (being vrged thervnto by the kindnesse which I haue found at your hands) to shew my thankfull mind towards you, although not in so ample manner as I would doe, or as I hope hereafter I shall doe, when it shal please God to make me better able, till which time I humbly desire you to accept at my hands this token of my feruent good will: wherein I haue made bold to set foorth vnder your Worships Pa∣tronage, this Booke, entituled The delectable

Historie of Celestina the Faire: hoping it wil be the better regarded of your Worship, first in respect of the indeuour and pains which hath bene taken in translating and publishing of the same, to the intent the reading thereof might be some pleasure and delight both to your Worship and your good friends: and se∣condly in respect of my thankful and willing mind towards you, who wisheth vnto your Worship all bountifull happinesse in this life, according to your hearts desire, and in the life to come eter∣nall felicitie.
