My Lord,
IF we consider what pains Men will take to be ex∣quisitely wicked, what di∣ligence they will use to serve the worst Masters in the worst of Causes; and as if the way to Hell was not broad and steep enough, with the sweat

of their Brows; loss of their Estate, Rest, and Ease, procure to themselves Infamy, Death, and Damnation. It not onely shews us the Malignity and Poyson of their Natures, that can never rest; but is still throwing them sometimes in∣to the Fire, and sometimes in∣to the Water: but it reminds us of that indispensable Obli∣gation and Duty every Ver∣tuous and Loyal Soul lies un∣der, with his utmost Power, In∣tegrity, and Sincerity to serve his God and his King, and purchase Heaven and Happi∣ness. And since there is not the most contemptible Instru∣ment, but by our Enemies is made use of, and hath his task

allotted him; some to revile the Government, some to in∣vent some to spread Rumours and Fears; some to assist with their Heads, some with their Hands, and those with their Purses; every little wheel helping to move on the ill modelled Fabrick: and since every Loyal Person hath an interest and share in his Prince, every one is concerned in the safety of the Father of his Country; in such times when he is visibly aim'd at by ill-de∣signing Men; I thought I might claim the priviledge of Craesus Son, and cry (God) save the King!
And I am the more em∣boldned to shelter my self

under your Lordships Pro∣tection, because though my unfitness for so great an At∣tempt as this might deter me; yet I am assured the design cannot be unacceptable to your Lordship, who have shewed so steady and unby∣assed a Loyalty, even in the worst of times; all your A∣ctions having carried that Spirit of Loyalty, Worth, and Grandeur, that as they are the glory of this Age, so they may be a Pattern for succeed∣ing Times.
How needful it is that eve∣ry one in his several Station should countermine that rest∣less Party, and quench those Fires they incessantly kindle;

Your Honours Prudence must needs be sensible of, who, not onely are placed in Birth and Authority eminently above, and have a true Prospect of those occurrences which we but darkly apprehend; but having in your own Person set the Tumultuous rage of that Seditious Band; which yet hath given a luster to all your glories, the Rabble having no sense of Vertue, but to hate it; and there being no more a pregnant sign of true worth, and Excellency than their Ma∣lice: as Christianity was ho∣nour'd by being Persecuted by a Nero. Vouchsafe, Great Sir, to accept this small Testi∣mony of that boundless ho∣nour

and service I have for your Lordship, and may the Honesty and Integrity of the Design Attone for the other Faults, since it comes from an heart full of Gratitude for for∣mer Favours, and from him whose highest Ambition (next to serving his God and his King) is to shew how much he is, My Lord,
