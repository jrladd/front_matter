My Lord,
YOur at this time being the great Parent and Fa∣ther of this large and populous City, causeth me to acquaint your Honour with my present Intenti∣on to make publick, these brief and short rules for the Syllabication of our English Tongue, they being a preparation to an Art by me invented, for a speedy, certain, and judicious facilitating, and per∣fecting of the Orthography thereof. In this first di∣vulging whereof, I apprehend none more fit, (conside∣ring their Occasions to make use thereof) whereunto to commit the same for Patronage, than the Prenti∣ces of your City of London, they being the lowest estate and rank, under your Lordships great care and charge, whose right welfare and propriety is determined, stated, and secured, by your Authority
 and Fatherly care; Wherfore in my thoughts here∣on, I conceived it a foul piece of Impudence, and disorderly boldnesse in me, to let such an attempt appear in the world, before I had made an Ad∣dress to your Honour for Allowance and appro∣bation thereof: I humbly therefore prostrate both my self, and these my Indeavours, at your Lord∣ships feet, in all humbl wise craving your good leav in, and favourabl acceptance of this my clear in∣tention in this enterprize, for the unspeakable bene∣fit of my Nativ Countrey; which if your Lord∣ship will pleas to further, I shall ever remain,

March 1654.
