May it please your Grace,
IT was a Mighty Veneration the first and better Ages had for their Governours, The Guides of their Souls, agree∣ably to the Rules of Christianity, and even to the common sense of Mankind; And that quite contrary now-a-dayes, the Holy Orders are vilely esteemed by
Abundance of Men, (and those some∣times pretending a High Zeal for Reli∣gion,) is to be imputed very much to their bad Education in their tender years, and perhaps to no one thing more.
But it is not against this Evil alone, that a good Education of our Youth would provide an effectual Remedy, but in my opinion, against a Multitude of Epidemical Errors and Immoralities. It is certain, True Religion thrives best when planted betimes, having its Foundation in an early Piety. Happy are those Chil∣dren whose Lot is to be begotten of Godly Parents, careful to season their Minds with vertuous and sober Princi∣ples, and while they are Children, to acquaint them with the Scriptures of Truth and Godliness None start with greater Advantages in the Christian Race, nor usually persevere with a more vi∣gorous Constancy therein, then they who are taught to remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, the first Fruits of their Time being Consecrated to God and Religion, before corrupt affections have
clapt a Bias upon their Inclinations, and a Train of Vices hath depraved, and in great measure laid a sleep the Natural No∣tions of Good and Evil in them.
To this great purpose Catechizing and Diligence in teaching the Catechism is continually and very appositely urged upon Us of the Parochial Clergy, by our Ordinaries in their Annual Visitations, according to the Royal Injunctions. And loth I am to say, or even to think any of my Brethren so culpable, as either to be so ignorant as to need my Instructions, or so negligent as to want my Excite∣ments in so necessary and (as is Uni∣versally acknowledged) so profitable an Office of their Ministration.
It is for the common People's sake therefore, that I expose these Specimens of my Labours in this kind to a publick View. I think it a great Blessing to them, that they may have the Advantage of being taught by both their senses, their Eyes as well as their Ears. What is taught by the Ear may affect and pierce more, but the Letter written endureth
longer, and the Souls of men have the Advantage of a more deliberate Consi∣deration, and a longer continuance therein.
Having therefore a Desire to do good both ways, according to my poor Abilities, (not so much fearing Censures, as endea∣vouring to Edifie,) I submissively offer these my Labours to your Graces Patro∣nage, as justly yours, being performed in your Charge, by one under your Fa∣therly Jurisdiction, who unfeignedly pray∣eth for the Peace and Prosperity of Gods Holy Catholick Church, and the conti∣nual dew of his Heavenly Blessing upon the Bishops and Clergy thereof, and par∣ticularly a double Portion of his Spirit up∣on your Grace; that we may be long hap∣py in your Wise and Active Conduct; and one who earnestly begging your Graces Prayers for him, heartily desires to approve himself upon all Occasions.
