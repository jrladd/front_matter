A Worke not smelling of the Lampe, to night,
But fitted for your Maiesties disport,
And writ to the Meridian of your Court,
VVee bring; and hope it may produce delight:
The rather, being offered, as a Rite
To Schollers, that can iudge, and faire report
The sense they heare, aboue the vulgar sort
Of Nut-crackers, that onely come for sight.
Wherein, although our Title, Sir, be Newes.
Wee yet aduenture, here, to tell you none;
But shew you common follies, and so knowne,
That though they are not truths, th'innocent Muse
Hath made so like, as Phant'sie could them state,
Or Poetry, without scandall, imitate.
