SIR, There is no wise man would giue his thoughts for all the world: Which as they are the most plea∣sing, and noble businesse of man, being the naturall and immediate issue of that reason, whereby he is seuered from brute crea∣tures: So they are in their
vse most beneficiall to our selues, and others. For, by the meanes hereof, we en∣ioy both God and our selues; and hereby wee make others partners of those rich excellencies, which God hath hid in the mind. And though it be most easie and safe, for a man, with the Psalmist, to commune with his owne heart in silence; yet is it more behoouefull to the common good, for which (both as men and Christi∣ans) we are ordained, that those thoughts, which our experience hath found comfortable and fruitfull
to our selues, should (with neglect of all censures) be communicated to others. The concealement wherof (me thinkes) can proceed from no other ground, but either timerousnesse, or enuy. Which consideration hath induced me to clothe these naked thoughts in plaine and simple words, and to aduenture them into the light, after their fellowes: Consecrating them the rather to your name for that (besides all other respects of duetie) they are part of those Me∣ditatiōs, which in my late peregrination with you,
tooke me vp vnder the so∣litary hilles of Ardenna; wāting as thē the opportu∣nity of other imployment. I offer them to you, not for that your selfe is not sto∣red with choice of better; but as poore men vse to bring presents to the rich: If they may carrie accep∣tatiō from you, and bring profit vnto any soule, it shall abundantly satisfie me; who should thinke it honour enough, if I might bee vouchsafed to bring but one pin towardes the decking of the spouse of Christ; whiles others, out of their abūdance, adorne
her with costly robes, and rich medals. I commend their successe to God, their patronage to you, their vse to the world. That God multiplie his rare fauours vpon you, and your worthy La∣die; and go you on to fauour
