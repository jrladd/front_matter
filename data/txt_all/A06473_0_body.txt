Right Honorable:
YOur BrothersLieute∣nant Co∣ronell Goring. real worth she∣wed to mee in the Warres abroad, im∣boldned me to present this new borne babe to your Protection, not

doubting but to finde the same Reality of worth in your Selfe in the Court at home, as I found in Him in for∣raigne Leagers: The Subiect is new & Mer∣ry, the fitter eyther for Court or Field. It was conceiued and perfect∣ed in ten daves space; and how desires tuiti∣on vnder your Lord∣ship. It is the Emblem of my affection, and so hopes to be lou'd & lik'd the better & soo∣ner;

it is the first, but not perhaps to bee the last. I had thought to haue presented it vnto your Lordship, before this time in Print, as I did in the Manuscript, had not eyther some maleuolent spirit, or enuious Planet crost me in my designes. I wish that it may bee e∣steem'd nere the worse, though from so meane a hand, and so vnwor∣thy a person as my self. Lend it a fauourable

smle to comfort and cherish it, and it shal be the highth of my de∣sires; thus presenting my selfe, it, and what is, or shall be mine, to your Honor. I hum∣bly take my leaue.
