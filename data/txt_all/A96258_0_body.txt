Honourable Mrs.
THe principall motive which impelled mee to consecrate the sub∣sequent Treatise unto
 your Name, is the same which at the first invited me to pen it, and that was to pu∣blish it to the benefit of the Towne and Countrey wherein I live, that every one that would but take the paines to peruse this little Tract, & make triall of the receipts of Physick and Chirur∣gery at large declared therein, might much benefit themselves, &
 doe much good to their acquaintance & friends.
Honoured Mistress, nothing hath more afflicted me than the death of him who truly honoured you in his life, and was truly beloved by you to his death, your dear Brother, my best Friend, William Morley Esquire, who died of this contagious dis∣ease, the Small Pox. I
 shall ever admire and proclaim his vertues and goodness, who of his innate & noble di∣sposition, loved all his followers in generall, as his fellow-souldi∣ers. I wept for him at his death, as for a Brother, and after death saw him ho∣nourably buried, as a Souldier; but I'le la∣ment no more his death, who is transla∣ted into a better life,
 nor weepe for him that is in joy, nor put on mourning clothes for him that is clo∣thed with Immorta∣lity; whom death hath parted, I hope blessed eternity shall at length bring toge∣ther again. So I leave him and returne to you; I have strived to shape my subject to the affection of so ho∣nourable a Patroness as your self, to whom
 I dedicate this rude piece, which I could have wished might have been underta∣ken by a more able workman: vouchsafe therefore to shroud under your protecti∣on this unpolished worke which I offer not as a Present, but as a Homage I owe you. And therefore the marke I chiefly aimed at, was not at a∣ny vain hope of praise
 to my self (which how little I hereby deserve I am not so weak but to perceive) but to leave a testimony to my Countrey, how much I desire her be∣nefit, and to your self, how much I am bound to remain,
Mistress,
