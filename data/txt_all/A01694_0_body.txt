TRuely honor'd Lady, and by me (for many your great fauours) to bee euer (more) then honoured: As some testimony of my dutifull remembrance, to answere by humble thankfulnesse, what all o∣ther meanes vtterly dis-able me of, some part of such your especiall open handed graces receiued; I offer you a translated Apologie of womens faire vertues, written in French by a Lord of great reckoning, giuen by him to a

very honorable Dutchesse: since, trans∣lated by a fellow and friend of myne now absent, who gaue me trust to see it should not wander in the world vn∣regarded, or depriued of that beati∣tude which makes bookes respected, whereto animated beside by diuers my good friends: I haue (noble Lady) the rather thus presumed. If eyther then for the subiect, my selfe, or my friendes sake, it may seeme any way pleasing to you: the French Lord ne∣uer thought his labour halfe so graced, as I will continually confesse our for∣tunes honored.
