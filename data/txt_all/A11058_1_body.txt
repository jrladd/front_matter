RIGHT HONORABLE,
THE Athenians while they were in doubt whom they shold chuse to be the Patron of their Citie, at last  that  was preferred, because of her wisedome and learning to Neptune

the rich god of the great Ocean, for they thought their could be no grea∣ter glorie then to haue a learned Pa∣tron, therefore they preferred her peaceable Oliue, to his warlike horse, her peare to his three-forked Scepter, her virginitie, to his ample authoritie, her Dragon to his Triton, and her learning to his vaste dominion, and good reason, for according to the Co∣mic: . Euen so this little Booke could not finde a fit∣ter Patron to grace and defend her, then your Lordship, in whom wit and learning, greatnesse and goodnesse, sci∣ence and conscience haue met toge∣ther. Truly, God hath inriched your Honour, with a great measure of lear∣ning and other excellent parts, that it was not without iust cause, that our great Mecenas and immortall glorie of the Muses hath aduanced your Lordship, that vnder him you might see learning aduanced. Whose Life so

long as the God of Iacob doth conti∣nue we neede not feare, that illiterate Lacedemonians, or ignorant Thraci∣ans, shall beare rule either in our Church or Common-wealth, , no Marius shall be countenan∣ced, to condemne the Greeke, Latine and Hebrew tongues; no Caligula to abolish the verses of diuine Virgil and Homer, or the workes of Liuius and Seneca; no Caracalla to persecute Phi∣losophers and burne the works of great Aristotle; no Licinius to account lear∣ning the pestilence of the state, but the Muses shall sit and sing securely vpon Helicon, and knit garlands of Laurell to Crowne his sacred head, and sing eter∣nall Peans to the honour of there great Peace-maker, Qui Musis haec otia fecit, and amongst the rest,

Si quid mea carmina possunt,
Nulla dies vnquam memori eum eximet uo.

Receiue then Right Honorable, this Athenian client vnto your tuition, in

whom although there be neither  nor , yet if your Lord∣ship be pleased to approoue her, shee cares not who reprooue her. So be∣seeching God who hath made you great in this kingdome, to make you also great in his Kingdome; I humbly take my leaue and will continue,

Dum res, & aetas, & Sororum,
Fila trium patiuntur atra.
