May it please Your HONOURS,
I Know it is usuall in addresses of this nature, to those who court favour to themselves, or ap∣plause to their Books, to make the utmost stret∣ches, in complementing those Persons of Qua∣lity whose patronage they claim, and to spend themselves in copious panegyricks fetched from all the To∣picks

of flattery, so far as they are capable to improve them: But I have the happiness of being fred from this trouble, you being such as neither need, nor desire to be caressed in that manner; And I may justly call this an hap∣piness to me, since my naturall temper removes me to the greatest distance from the confines of that service vice. I can not indeed withold my self from acknowledging, that I owe you all the expressions of Gratitude which I can ne∣ver be able to pay; and when I tell the world, that as you have honours entailed upon you from a long Series of Il∣lustrious Ancestors, so you are like to transmit them unble∣mished to your Posterity, to whose honours it will be an addition, to have it remembered that they are yours; and that for your Noble Qualities and Vertues, you are justly esteemed and beloved of all who have the honour of your acquaintance, I am assured that I doe not transgress the Rules of the severest modestie, their is only one thing which I must utter to your commendation, because it ought not to be concealed, namely, your being faithfull to God and Conscience, in adhereing to the true Protestant Reli∣gion, in a time when many have made defection, and you have been assaulted with such tentations, as nothing but a brave Resolution, and a mighty grace could have enabled you to conquer: And tho you have been happily united, both in the conflict and Victory; yet let it not be offensive that I relate what part each of you have acted therein, and of this I shall say nothing but with the assurance of a Wit∣ness and with the Ingenuity becoming a man of my Pro∣fession.
Those who understood your Inclinations, knew, that you could have been well pleased, that the Romish Missio∣naries

would have saved themselves the trouble of the Vi∣sits they made you, And it was the opinion of some who were sollicitous for your safety, that you should have rid your selves of them, by denying them access; but as the sweetness of your tempers, doth (as it were by an inevitable force) carry you to deport your selves with an ob∣liging civility to all persons, so for other weighty consi∣derations, you did not relish that advice.
Upon you (MY LORD) they did begin to make some direct attempts, to seduce you from your Holy profession; but Your Lo: took a wise and compendious method to avoid their snares, by giving them to understand, that your mind was fully satisfied of the truth of your Religion, and that you had something else to doe, then entangle your self in perplexing debates with them knowing no good fruit that was to be reaped thereby: This resolute answer, made them perceive, it was in vain to insist any further that way; but they hoped, by fetching a compass a little about, to gain more ground.
It hath been an old craft of seducers (considering what interest Ladies have in the affection of their Husbands, and what power with their Children) to make their utmost essayes to proselite them to their Errours, not doubting, but if they succeed, they shall quickly have the whole familie at their Devotion: And therefore You MADAM was the prize on which they set their eyes; But Your La: did for see the danger, and provided to encounter it. These Cham∣pions of the Romish Religion who were to make their ad∣dresses to you, were given out to be men of vaste learning and admirable parts (for that is one of the arts of Papists, as they boast that their Church is infallible, so they would

have the world believe, that their Clergie are an invincible sort of men, that they may fright those whom they besiege u∣pon the first summonds to make a surrender) you therefore applied your self to a diligent use of all means, for your e∣stablishment in the Truth, you Prayed, and Read, and con∣ferred, and pondered deeply the matters of Religion, and thought, all you could doe in these wayes, no more then was needfull in so weightie an affair. Heaven hath endued you with a great stock of excellent gifts, a composed and comprehensive mind, a clearness and solidity of Iudgment, a deep reach, and readiness of expression, and these being joyned with singleness and sincerity of heart, are such ram∣parts and defences against seduction that they make the Soul almost impregnable: And that good God, who is never wanting to the assistance of his faithfull Servants, did furnish you with such light, and Grace, that your Faith hath remain∣ed unshaken. Those who designed to seduce you, soon per∣cieved, that they had not to doe with a person of an ordi∣nary capacity: Their usuall common places of arguments, they found you could easily answer; and your prejudices against their Religion though you proposed them only by way of Queries, and with the modestie of a Learner, were yet so framed, that it was evident to them, you had so pe∣netrated into the controversies of Religion, that they thought it a sort of Victory to get of, without being at some vi∣sible disadvantages, and I hardly knew any of them who ha∣ving once made an essay, were sond of a second encounter.
The Remembrance of the particular passages of your be∣haviour, is still very gratefull to me, and the relating of them would sure be very pleasing to others, but your mo∣destie and humility is such, that I may not adventure to

publish them: Onely give me leave to say concerning you both, that if either crastie insiauations, or the charmes of friendship, or worldly considerations, or long importunities, or any thing that could be projected by the wit and subti∣lity of Seducers, could have corrupted or byassed your minds, none of these methods were left unessayed: And when all these efforts proved unsuccessfull, and all Topicks were exhausted; yet that they might be ever like themselves; they had the impudence to write, and spread reports to distant places in this Kingdom, that you were their Converts, or just at the turning point: Whether this was done out of spite, or to be an Argument, to prevail with others of a se∣quacious humour to imitate such noble Precedents I cannot determine; but this I know that Hell it self could invent nothing more false
The Gracious God hath in part rewarded your integrity, and constancy, and I hope will doe it yet more: Your saith is strengthned, by these winds of temptation, you have the joyes of a good Conscience, you are hereby endeared to all serious and Godly persons, and providence hath of late interposed to bring some secular affairs of great concernment to your Noble Familie to a confortable and desired period, and that at a nick of time, when it could searce have been expected, and a few days longer delay might have quite ruined them. I hope you will in all this observe the lov∣ing kindness of the Lord, and ever remember your engage∣ments to Iesus Christ who hath interceeded for you, that your saith might not fail.
I have little to say concerning this Poem which I offer unto you, I confess it is a mean present, yet you know its offe∣red from an affectionat mind: After I had write the first

copie of it, I put it immediatly in your hands; and you were pleas'd to commend it, severall copies of it are since spread, of which some are very incorrect, to doe my self justice I have at length resolved to publish it: It cannot much serve the ends of my reputation, and so I may hope that it cannot be imputed to vanitie. My publishing it under your shaddow, can only signifie that which I am well e∣nough pleased the World should know, namely, that you have a great goodness for me, when I can presume that you will favourably accept of such a trifile: Gratitude oblig∣eth me to make you richer offerings, but I have them not to make; my Prayers to God for you, are the best com∣pensations I can give for your favours to me, and these are, and daily shall be offered up unto Heaven, for the prospe∣ritie of your Souls, the increass of your grace and the flo∣rishing of your Noble Family by
RIGHT HONORABLE,
