SIr, by your Art, and Pythagorean Pen, 
I'd prove a Metempsychosis agen;
And were His Soul of Decimals but made, 
As Plato's Soul o'th' world of Seven is said,
I'd swear 'twas slunk to you; but that you shew
More Skill than e're his rambling fancy knew, 
Let roving Rabbies praise their Seven and Four; 
We'l shew them Misteries enough and more:
The Heav'nly Orbs are Ten, their Motions all
Conspire to make a perfect Decimal: 
This is their Musick, and they shall be thus,
In spight of Tycho or Copernicus. 
'Tis said the Muses are but Nine, but who
(Rather than fail) cann't add Apollo too? 
Thus may we range the world, and quickly find,
We all to th' number of our Fingers bind. 
Thus Logick all the wandring Species brings,
And places under tenfold Heads of things. 
Thus I, to give the Author praise in all,
Reduce my Verses to a Decimal.
