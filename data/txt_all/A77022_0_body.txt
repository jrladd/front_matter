Beloved in the Lord,
HAving for some Years been a Companion with you in the fel∣owship of the Gospel; and by the hand of God upon me, and your requirement, have been nstrumental among you as pportunities have been of∣fered,
 to impart unto your Edification what I through grace received: Now, consi¦dering that Mortality is ap∣proaching near towards me and having those words of the Apostle Peter upon my spirit which saith: Moreover, I wil endeavour, that after my De∣cease, you may be able to hav these things always in Remem¦brance, 2 Pet. 1.15. And like¦wise considering the abound¦ing of Iniquity & Errors, bot in Opinion & Practice in thes latter days; all which do wit¦ness the truth of that in a grea part, which our Saviour Chris and his Apostles in holy w have fore-told; the which  much manifested in Papis
 Rantisme, Quakerisme, and superstitious Ceremonalism: as also the abounding of self-love, self-endedness, and pro∣phane and vicious Atheisme. I thought it my care and duty to present unto you this small Treatise; wherein is compri∣sed most of the chief heads, and principle grounds of doctrine, that by me hath been deliver∣ed unto you; hoping that you will make these lines herein contained, your Companions; sometimes when you sit at your Table, or Window, or by the Fire-side, that they may be your Remembrancers, how you have heard and received; and that you may hold fast un∣to all stability & perseverance
 in judgment, and practice, th truths therein contained tha are agreeable to the revealed will of God; that when I have put off this Tabernacle, and am Deceased, these few glean∣ings out of Gods Vintage may be of some use unto you, the better to enable you to stand fast in the Truth, in unity of the Spirit, striving together for the faith of the Gospel. So with my Prayers to God for you, hoping to see your faces in Heavenly Mansion places, I remain your Servant in what I may, for Jesus sake both Night and Day.
