MADAM,
Although the greatnes of your blood doth chalenge much
respect, yet I knovve by ex∣perience, that your LADI∣SHIP thinketh vertue to be only and true nobilitie; and that to be Gods seruāt, you esteeme it your greatest glorie. This therfore ver∣tuous and religious disposi∣tiō of yours, beinge the on∣ly loadstone that dravveth my affection to loue, and honour you, hath embol∣dened me to present vnto your LADISHIPS veivve, this little treatise of men∣tall prayer, vvith the life of the Authour, vvhich longe since, and alvvayes from
the first time I tooke it in hand, I intēded to shrovvde vnder the vvinges of your protection, but beinge hin∣dred by some occasions, vvherin holy obedience hath emploied me; I could neuer compas my desires till novve. I novve ther∣fore send it to your LADI∣SHIP desiringe you to ac∣cept of it, not for my de∣sertes, vvhich indeede haue bene none to claime such a fauour, but for the digni∣tie of the matter of vvhich it treateth (though I am afraied made much vvorse
by my vnskilfull pen) as also for the sanctitie of the Authour vvho made it, and your LADISHIP vvill in∣crease my many obliga∣tions tovvardes you, and alvvayes oblige me to rest and remaine.
MADAM,
