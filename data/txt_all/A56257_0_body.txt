My LORD,
THE extraordinary Character you have acquird by the joint Consent of those that have the Honour of your Acquaintance, Encourages me to deviate from the common Road, used by our Modern Authors; being made sufficiently sensible, how much a

Mind endow'd with Genorous and Mo∣dest Inclinations (the inseparable Com∣panions of a Great Soul) disdains the fulsome Praises, which those Gentle∣men make the Chief Subject of their Dedications, whenever they pretend to Court the Patronage of Persons of Quality, in behalf of their Treatises. I must confess, I should scarce have had so much Presumption thus to in∣trude my self into your Lordship's Fa∣vour, if I had not been sufficiently persuaded, that the Renown our Au∣thor has so deservedly gaind both here and abroad (and that under the Protection of some of the greatest Princs in Europe) would be pre∣vailing enough with your Lordship, to pardon an Undertaking, which, if in it self justifiable in nothing else, might perhaps claim the benefit of a general Custom from your Goodness. The Reputation of our Author being so universally and unquestionably e∣stablished

among all such as have a true relish of Learning, I might with∣out the least Prejudice to him, super∣cede to enlarge here upon this Treatise, if it were not rather out of a desire to satisfie the Curiosity of some, who be∣leive to have sufficient Reason for certain Objections made against some Assertions contained in this Treatise, than with an Intention to make the least Addition to a Piece, which, whe∣ther in regard of the nicety of the Sub∣ject it Treats of, or of the Concatina∣tion and force of its Arguments, de∣serves to be reckoned among the best now extant in Europe. Those, who cen∣ter the utmost Felicity of Civil Socie∣ty in a Democratical form of Govern∣ment, have not been wanting to charge our Author with too much Passion for that Doctrine, of Passive Obedience, which leaves Subjects to the absolute Disposal of their Princes; But, be∣sides that, the Appendix annexed to

this Treatise, written by our Author, in opposition to Mr. Hobbes's Mon∣strous Principles concerning this un∣limited Power, may sufficiently clear him from this Imputation; If these Gentlemen would have taken the pains to make a due comparison of the se∣veral Passages both in this, and other Treatises of our Author, relating to this Subject, they might, without much difficulty, have been convincd of their Error; As far as I am capable of pe∣netrating into the Matter, it is the word Princeps, or Prince, which sticks most closely in their Stomachs, not con∣sidering, That the Words, Summi Imperantes, or Sovereigns; and that of Princeps, or Prince, are Sy∣noms to our Author; and that out of a great many Passages in this Trea∣tise, it is sufficiently apparent, that he attributes the Sovereign Power not always to one single Person, but some∣times

also to a Council invested with the Supream Administration of the So∣vereign Authority in the Common∣wealth. If it were but only for that Advice given by our Author at the very beginning of his Appendix to young Lawyers, to wit, to take care, that under the Pretence of main∣taining the Prerogatives of Princes, they should not be prodigal of their Liberty and Property, and his as∣serting the Foundation of Civil Socie∣ties to be built upon the Common Consent of mutual Defence against Violences; This alone, I say, might be a convincing Argument to any un∣byass'd Person, that his Aim was very remote from maintaining an Ar∣bitrary Power in the State, The next thing laid to our Author's Charge is, that he so entirely separates the Chri∣stian Religion from the State, as not to have the least Interference with one another; whereas the contrary is now

a-days practised in most Christian Stas, and in the Commonwealth of the Jews (instituted by God▪s peculi∣ar Direction) this Union was insepa∣rable. It cannot be denied, but that the outward Form of Church Govern∣ment, especially among the Protest∣ants, is in a great measure, and in most places adapted to that of the State; it being evident, that most of the Monarchical States, Episcopa∣cy, as most suitable with that Consti∣tution, was never abolished; as on the contrary, the same was quite extirpa∣ted in the Protestant Common∣wealths. This is most particularly observable among the Lutherans, who, tho' all agreeing in Point of Doctrine, are nevertheless, so far different from one another in the Ceremonial Point, and outward Form of Church Govern∣ment, that in outward Appearance, they seem'd to be so many several Churches. Thus in the two Northern

Kingdoms of Sweden and Denmark, the Episcopal Authority (tho' much diminish∣ed in its Revenues) is retained to this day; whereas in some Commonwealths in Germany, where the same Religion is E∣stablished, it is quite abolished, and not the least footsteps of Subordination of Priests to be met with. But this Objection is ea∣sily cleared, if we take into due Considera∣tion, that it being the Intention of our Author to represent in those places Reli∣ligion in its genuine and native Constitu∣tion, freed from all what is foreign to its true Genius, he did not think it conveni∣ent, to clog it with any thing that was not an Essential part of it; especially when his chief aim was to shew the real difference betwixt the Christian and Jewish Religi∣on. There are also not a few, who prom∣pted by a preposterous Zeal, have imputed to our Author a certain kind of Liberti∣nism in Religion, for which, I can see no other Reason, than that they are dissatisfi∣ed with his Assertions against any thing that has the least resemblance of Persecu∣tion upon the score of Difference of Opini∣ons. I am well satisfied, that the Rea∣sons alledged by him, are so solid in them∣selves, and so exactly applied to this Pur∣pose, that they cannot but be Convincing

to all such, as are not prepossssed either with By Interest, or a most stupid Igno∣rance, For, if the Slavery of the Body be absolutely repugnant to the Inclinations of a generous Soul, How much more in∣supportable must the Slavery of the Mind be to a sublime Genius, elevated above the common Sphere of bigotted Zealots Ig∣norance, being the Mother of perverted Zeal, and consequently of a persecuting Spirit, the same ought to be look'd upon as the common Enemy of all such as are guided by the Light of true Reason? I cannot but take notice here, that our En∣glish Modern Clergy has of late gain'd so peculiar a Character of following so close∣ly these footsteps of convincing such as differ from them in Opinion, rather by strength of Argument, than any forcible Means, that I do not know whether they are not preferrable in this Point, before any other in Europe. If any one questions th Truth of it, I appeal to Mr. Toland's Case, concerning his Treatise, Entituled, Christianity not Mysterious. It is both beyond my scope, and the compass of a Letter, to enter upon the Merits of the Cause on both Sides, it will be sufficient here to refer my self to what has been Published against him lately here in En∣gland,

and in other Places; All which, if duely compared, will soon evince, how much the English Clergy as out-done the rest, both by force of Argument, and a generous, gentle Behaviour. But I am afraid I have abused your Lordship's Pa∣tience; I will therefore conclude with re∣commending both my Author and my Self, to your Lordship's Protection, beg∣ging Leave to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
