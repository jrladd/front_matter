GOod Sir, after I had read with com∣fort, that which I gayned from you with much intreaty, I meane a copie of your Sermon, preached at my wiues Funerall; I was so ful and pregnant of the birth, that I could beare no longer, but must needs bring foorth the same, and lay it in the lap of Gods children: which how euer I vse it in the nursing, was from your selfe a perest birth. Happily you will deem I do you wrong, to publish the same without your futher warrantie: indeede you may and my selfe should thinke none other; but that fearing vpon a second intreaty you might either perswade me in your loue, or ouer-awe me by your authority▪ to de∣sist from printing the same: I haue thought good rather to venture vpon all carthly replies, thē to hazard the want of so heauenly a solace.



Good sir pardon my boldnes, for and if you would giue me your house full of gold, I cannot keepe in, what God will haue out: nor can I bee silent where God will speake: The best is, I lacke no priuiledge: The Lord hath giuen good success: The Examiner full allowance: The Learned good approuall: And my conscience is cleare within: I doe it neither to your praise, or my own, but with a single heart to set out the Lords glory. And for the wantonnes of the world, the iniquitie of the time, and the multitude of ma∣licious wreslers, of whom you speake; let them alone, whilest they but pine themselues in feeding vpon our best things. The Lord giue you grace, countenance, and continuance in the bleshed worke of the Ministery, for his Sions sake.
London this 20. of Nouember 1601.
