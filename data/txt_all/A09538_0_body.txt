YOur late fauourable intertaine∣ment
(Right Honorable) vouch∣safed
to this my hard fauoured
Childe, is now my incourage∣ment
againe to present her to
you, clad in this new habite. She
hath cause to shroude her selfe vnder Honours
wing: for so rude is her habite, and so meane her
parentage; that were not such patronage a safe
refuge to her, when the malicious shall persecute
her: I feare she would be accounted a roague; and
for wandring abroad in so vnfauourable a time,
be scourged with the whip of disgrace, and lashed

with the sharpe rod of euery Criticks censure.
Those many fauours, which you honourably
extended to my father, whilst he liued, and still
continue to his name and children; claime a farre
greater testimony of gratefulnes, then the greatest
of my small indeuours can affoord: notwithstan∣ding,
accept a dutifull minde, witnessed in a rude
sort; and when Time shall with some of his fea∣thers,
better cloath my scarce-feathered Muse:
she will better testifie how highly she honours and
admires your worth. In meane time pardon her
present vnworthines, and once againe take in
good worth this mine vnworthy present: where∣of,
hauing reason to rest perswaded, I leaue further
to interrupt your serious affayres, and so humbly
take my leaue.
