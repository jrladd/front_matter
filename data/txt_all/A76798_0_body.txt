MY LORD,
TO testifie that due acknowledgement of Your Lordships favors, whereto I am obliged, I have hereto prefixt Your Lordships name. Among all studies none are to be preferr'd before the study of the Scriptures. LU∣THER, when one Chapter was opened to him, said, Me thinks I see heaven opened. Here are several Chapters opened, wherein, if God shall open himself to Your Lordships heart, heaven shall undoubtedly be opened unto you. Let not Your Lordship herein expect the flourishing garnish of humane Elo∣quence, nor the glorious varnish of Rhetorical expressions, but naked truth, or at least the same drest up in an homely garb. Truth is more potent them Eloquence, the spirit better then wit, Faith greater then Learning, and the foolishness of God stronger then men. All knowledge, save that of the Scriptures, is but perishing food, yea the very knowledge
of the Scriptures is no better, unless, as the understanding be affected with the truth of them, the will be affected with the goodness therein presented. In vain is all knowledge if it be not improved to the benefit of our own souls. If our know∣ledge consist onely in methodical discoursing of God, we shall glorifie him onely as the Painter doth the party whose picture he hath exactly taken. With all the truths of God our hearts should have such correspondence, as between the Character and Letter instamp'd. My Lord, if now and then you shall re∣deem an hour from Court-affairs to Closet-contemplation to peruse this ensuing Treatise, I hope (through the blessing of God) your labor will not be in vain. I have no more at present, save to exhort you to take opportunities of doing much for God, who hath done so much for you, that so your faith and fruits of righteousness, may abound in the day of account, which with my prayers to the Lord for Your Lordship, Your Lady, and Posterity, is the hearty request of,
MY LORD,
