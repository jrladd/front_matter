SIR, what you seriously be∣gan long since, and haue alwayes beene very careful for the full perfection of, at length thus finished, al∣though perhaps not so well to your expectation, I present you with, as one before all most woorthy of the same, both in re∣spect of your earnest trauaile therin, & the great desire you haue continually had for the generall profite. My humble desire is, that you would▪ take into your kinde protection, this old and new burden of wit, newe in this forme and title, though otherwise old, and of great antiquitie, as beeing a methodicall collection of the most choice and select admonitions and sentences, compendi∣ously drawne from infinite varietie, diuine, hi∣storicall,

poeticall, politique, morrall, and hu∣mane. As for the enuious and ouercurious, they shall the lesse trouble mee, sith I knowe there is nothing in this worlde but is subiect to the Erynnis of ill disposed persons, whose malice is as fatall as the darte of Cephalus, or Paris shaft, which neyther a seauenfold-shielde, nor Vulcans cunning workmanshippe, nor Pallas Aegis can auoyde. Thus humbly crauing par∣don for my boldnesse, beseeching GOD daily to encrease the affection you beare to learning, I take my leaue.
