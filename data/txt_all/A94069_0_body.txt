SIR,
THis Book falling by Providence into my hands, and the earnest intreaty of divers Christian and pious friends in London, having drawn from me the Epistle to the Reader, as also having heard much of your being an admirer of the Author here∣of (Reverend Master Strong, now blessed in the Eternall Mansions above) I made bold to commend the book also to
your selfe, as an humble ac∣knowledgment of the faithfull service I owe you, by the same way of fellowship and com∣munion in Gospell-Ordinan∣ces, with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ our Lord: we must all attain to that blessed and eternall communion, where the presence of God & Christ in glory, shall transcend the purest Ordinances here below. But if either we turn our backs upon holy and pre¦tious truths received, and once publickly professed, or let our zeal cool, or by sitting still go not forward, we both lose the comfort of communion here, and shall have lesse communi∣on in glory. No doubt, Sir, but it is a wild age wherein we live; many stupendious chan∣ges, strange turnings, and a∣mazing
alterations we have seen, both in Church and State, and who knowes what yet any of us must undergo; we have therefore more need to stick to our principles, more faithfully to own Gods name, and to maintain our practise in holinesse with more vigor and constancy, that in the end we may reap, if we faint not. Which that you, Sir, my Ho∣nourable friend, may still per∣form, and bring a greater glory to God, and do more good to that my native City of Coven∣try, where I was once an un∣worthy Lecturer, and to the whole Country better service, shining more gloriously in the end of your daies; that so when you have finished your course with joy, and kept the faith, the houre of temptation
which now is upon all the earth, that then you may re∣ceive the Crown laid up for you, which your Son & Wife, now both blessed and glorious, are enjoying to all eternity, is, and shall be the hearty and earnest prayer of him, who doubts not of your candid ac∣ceptation of this my bold pre∣sumption, but desires in all things ever to be found,
Sir

From my Study Brides-Church∣yard, London.
