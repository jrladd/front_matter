MADAM,
ALthough Death may be stiled the sum∣mum bonum of Mankind, yet now has he proved fatal to mortality, by depriving three Kingdoms of that Jewel, which promised Poste∣rity eternal happiness; the many vertues of your royal Child, which outstript his tender years, made Heaven take notice of his early piety, & thought him a blessing too great for Mortals to enjoy: the immature dissolution of the late hope∣ful Branch has caused weeping grief to fly over this Island, for which unexpressible loss can not we be happy till Death transports us to the Ce∣lestial Regions, where we may eternally be ad∣miring that object, which the whole Nation so much adored whilst surviving: the absence of such a sacred Child (without whose conversation the joyes of Angels could not be compleat) must needs cut to the heart: the greatest Orators, that ere the World produced, cannot sufficiently ndole the royal Family's sorrow, therefore I
 do not presume to comfort such an insupportable affliction: I only attempt to lay this Tractate of the Consolation of Death on the shrine of your benigne favour, because it was occasionally writ∣ten on the too late unhappy misfortune of Eng∣land, for I am highly sensible that any thing of devotion finds grace in your sight, whose dazling beams of unparelleld godliness strike your admi∣ring beholders with as much stupefaction, as the brightness of the overshadowing Cloud did the amazed Disciples on Mount Tabor; Matchless Lady of Piety! your royal self being the only hopes great Brittain has now left to make her happy, I pray the Almighty King of Kings may lengthen your life with a Nestorian age, that by your resplendent Vertues we may be guided to those evelrasting Mansions, where the blessed Duke now sits crowned with immortality, so (divine Princess) I rest
