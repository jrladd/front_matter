If that you muse, to see your Name so short,
My Muse doth render this iust reason for't.
I grudge the paper should take any part.
Of what is written wholy in my heart.
KInde Sir, you may thinke it fit, I should haue dedicated this pra∣ctise to some very ene∣my: that hereby, I might haue taught him to be∣come
my friend, and Sui∣table to mine owne hu∣mor: but knowing that a horse marred in the brea∣king, will euer after re∣taine some iadish tricke; and that an ill bred na∣ture, can neuer make a good Friend with all the after teaching; I haue on the contrary, committed my Friend vnto my Friend, where it shall bee sure of friendly enter∣tainement: were it but my seruant, I would not send it to Nabal, for a churlish repulse: much lesse to Hanun to bee shorne, and torne, and af∣ter
scorned, and laughed at: if not my seruant; how then my Friend? which being right, and such an one as I desire to haue, I Kindly recom∣mend it to your selfe, which shall euer tell you, in my absence, that I loue you; which (I am sure Isocrates saith) is the propertie of a true Friend: and onely e∣nough for me, who be∣ing present with you, re∣ceiue such supply of your curtesies, by the minute; that I haue not time e∣nough to count them: lesse, to studie to requite
them, till I am parted from you. The God of peace be with you: and guide your steps to the glory of his sauing grace.
