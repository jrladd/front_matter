My LORD,
IN all Dedications, there is something of Design, Self, or Interest,—Et omni∣um sunt stultissimi qui auriculas studi∣ose tegunt: Especially before one so quick∣sighted and descerning as your Lordship; and therefore I shall with very little Re∣serve, tell your Honour all the ends that in∣duc't me to make choice of your illu∣strious Patronage: One is to testifie that real Reverence and Veneration I have to your Person, Place, and Dignities: and upon this account, common Decency and good Manners would have upbraided me to have made choice of any others Protection; especially in such dangerous and deadly times we now live in; Detraction like Infection being almost in every ones mouth, ready to poyson the best and greatest endeavours that can be used for a Preservative; and therefore neither Art, nor Nature,

nor Self, nor Interest could in charity advise me otherwise, then to take such an effectual and soveraign Preservative as your Patro∣nage, before I ventured into the open and common Air.
Nor could Policie direct me better then to borrow your Name; for if there be no other worth in the Treatise, yet, it will both in∣vite, and somewhat recompence the Reader to see so fair and stately a Frontispiece as your Honours Name place't before it: at least, they must like it much the better, and think it the more deserving for bearing so great a Sail.
And though I cannot, without huge Arrogancy pretend it to be a Present sutable to your Greatness and Deserts; yet it may pass for an acknowledgement of that high opinion, or rather certain knowledge, I have of your Vertues and Merits.
I have many other reasons to alledge in defence of the Dedica∣tion, as, your Lordships Power and Abilities to promote and re∣duce to practise, what others only can advise, discourse, think on, and wish for.
But, my Porch (I see) grows wide; and a large Preface will not so well sute with that little knowledge you have of me, and acquain∣tance I have with your Honour: besides, long Apologies, have usu∣ally more of bud, blossom, and colour, then consequence; and most commonly are like May-Poles, long and fruitless.
And therefore notwithstanding all the Alligations I have or can use, I shall intirely cast my self upon your Lordships goodness for Approbation and Acceptance, of what is due to you from
