MY verie gracious and good Mistres, the loue and dutie I
bare to your Father whilst hee liued now after his de∣ceasase
is to your hereditarie; to whom by the blessing
of your birth he left his vertues. VVho bequeathed you
those which were his, gaue you whatsoeuer good is mine, as deuo∣ted
to his, he being gone, whom I honoured so much whilst hee li∣ued;
which you may iustly challenge by all lawes of thankeful∣nes.
My selfe hauing beene a witnes of your excellent education,
and mild disposition (as I may say) euer from your Cradle, dedi∣cate
this Epistle of this vertuous and goodly Ladie to your selfe;
so like her in all perfection, both of wisedome and learning, which
I pray you accept, til time shall enable me to leaue you some grea∣ter
monument of my loue.
