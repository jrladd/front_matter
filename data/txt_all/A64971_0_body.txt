Dear Sister,
THough it be a great affliction to lose so excellent an Hus∣band as you enjoyed, and at whose Funeral this ensu∣ing Sermon was preached; yet that he was so excellent may also be an argument of Consolation. The thoughts of his be∣ing at rest in Heaven, and rewarded with that Crown which the Great Shepherd has promised to those Pastors who are faithful, may help to quiet and satisfie your spirit; especially considering, as Death was unconceivably gainful to him, so the Husband that lives for ever, can easily make up the loss of that mortal one who is taken from you.
Think of the Joys his Soul is fill'd with in Glory, when you find your sorrow swelling, and your grief transgressing due bounds. And withal remember, that He who has betrothed you unto himself for ever, is always near you, and has engaged himself, never to fail you, nor forsake you. How unchange∣able is his love! How great is his faithfulness! How tender are his bowels! How certainly does he sympathize with you in your sorrows! And how ready is he, to give that grace which is sutable and sufficient!
You performed your duty abundantly to your dear Hus∣band while he lived; and I must needs say, that by your love to him, and care of him, you have made the Church of Christ and Souls your Debtors. Pray do not fail in doing
 your duty now; which is, patiently to submit unto the will of God. The Gospel will be credited, and you will be no loser by such a submission.
The Lord increase grace in you exceedingly; and so shed abroad his love in your heart by his Spirit, as that the days of your Widowhood, may be the most comfortable you have ever lived. So prays,
