R. REVEREND:
YOu cannot but haue obserued, how when in time of ignorance, errour, and transgressi∣on, a Riddle was proposed in the Court of King Darius, what of all things was grea∣test and strongest: there were who stood for Wine, some for Kings, a third sort for Women; but Zorobabel inlightened by the God of Truth, gaue his verdict for Truth: That Truth was of all things grea∣test and strongest: Which his opinion, if it were then ap∣plauded by the people, approued by the Senators of State, honored and rewarded by King Darius himselfe; we, who beleeue the manifestation of the Word-Truth, and the il∣lightning of the World by the Word of Truth; may not maruell to obserue that Truth, now in this last houre (iustified of her own children) sits Ouant and Trium∣phant, not onely ouer Wine, Women, and Kings, as they

are in the common vsance of mankind; but also ouer and against Wine, Women, and Kings, as they are abused by that vsurping King of Kings, Who sits in the Tem∣ple of God, out-shewing himself as if he were a God; who though by sly contempt of Coniugall Chastitie (in his seduced Votaries) seemes to pretend Virginall purity, yet how vaine such his pretences haue beene, the pennes of his owne haue euidently discouered; though hee and his would be thought not to ouer-delight in any deli∣cacies or delicious Wines; yet in this respect precisely ta∣ken; they doe carke and care for the flesh, posting from all quarters and coasts, delicacies and delicious viands, and Wines for their Holy Father, and his Purpurats: yea, pro∣uiding for English Seminarists in Rome, not plaine Ro∣manisco, the common and vsuall briskish Wine of Italy, but Vino deripa Wine of the Bank (fit to beget Spanish Iinnets) must bee their cotidian liquor. Though inwords he pretend himselfe to be Seruant of the Ser∣uants of God, yet Truth euinces him to assume vnto himselfe either directly or indirectly (that is the lest) an o∣uertopping Soueraigntie ouer all that is sacred and ve∣nerable.
The preuailing of Truth against this Man of vntruth, hath not in any thing more euidently appeared, then in a gracious precedent illustration of Truth (before the powerfull and illustrious comming of the God of Truth) whereby he, who formerly by the Inhabitants of the Earth, was admired and adored as a Vice-God, a Vice-Christ; is now by the consent of renowned Peo∣ples, by the approuance of sagest Peeres of States, by opi∣nion of iudicious Kings and Princes, by censure of lear∣nedest Clerkes in Christendome, found to be the Apo∣calistticall Beast himselfe: and their Pontificious, Om∣nipotency,

and Burghesian Eternity to be naught else, then the very top-crowne of Antichristianisme. For the lay∣ing open and professing of this kind of Truth, the Spirit of God, who in the thickest of Egyptian darknesse, did here and there in times past excite some Worthies: hath in this last houre, (the third, fourth, and fifth Angells, euen yet powring forth their Vialls:) Like as in other Churches others, so in this renowned one of Great Brittain raised vp you, an Armie of Valiants, arightly ordered; who with tongue and penne do happily and dexteriously (without ceasing) per∣forme the same.
To which seruice it hath pleased him, who brought me from out the Babilonian Vr, to call me, an vnworthy one, and one farre lesse, then so great and gracious a miserati∣on; wherein, how farre and graciously, the Spirit of Truth hath enabled me in this and my other writings, I doe with all lowly reuerent and indifferent respect referre and remit to you all; all Louers of Truth; and to the thrice Reuerend and venerable Sees and Chayres of your learning, the renow∣ned Vniuersities of this Ile I said with indifferent re∣spect: for although I may not account  them Twins in eue∣ry respect alike, yet in regard of that Light (for the discer∣ning betwixt Truth and falshood) which they haue happi∣ly receiued from the God of Light, I dare write them, Semblable and Symbolizing Obs, illustrating this fa∣mous Church of Britaine, yea emaning forth their illu∣strius Beames, to the vtmost of the world. And by how plentifull and liber all a hand, he hath imbreathed of his Spirit into; and hath powred of his dew of Hermon vpon the Head of the most Gracious Primat of England (A thrice-worthy and best deseruing Patron of all Conuerts, and vnder God the only Feeder of Me and Mine) vnto the very skirts of the Garment, it doth most linely appeare, by

many, not wandring, but fixed Starres, seated and re∣splendant in this most illustrious Church of Great Bri∣taine.
Amongst whom, with speciall and deserued respect, I haue presumed (before this my Epistle) to prefix the names of some, by them speaking to you all: From them, & from you all, humbly desiring a fauourable and gracious countenancing both of Me, and Mine; in particalar of this my Argument of Truth and Ingenuity; for following my Text closely, I haue endeuoured (such is your wont) to open the genuine sense of the Holy Ghost therein contained: in the prosecuti∣on whereof, if some bitter and tart speeches against the Beast, &c. do occur; from the Lord they are.
Secondly of duty, for according to my bounden duty and seruice, I haue herein endeauoured to blazon the deserued ho∣nor of my Soueraigne Lord and Master: for his vndoubt∣able integrity in the thrice holy Religion he professeth, which by some (not peircing into the secrets of State) may vnworthily haue bin questioned.
Thirdly of Sincerity, for in regard of the sincerity of my conuersion from out of Babylon, I dare boldly stile my selfe, A Nathaniel in whom there is no guile.
Fourthly, I said of Zeale; for zeale against a certaine blaspheming Rabshaketh of the Beast, hath brought forth this argument of zeale against the Beast, and the obstinate Admirers and Adorers of the Beast? It was my hap to re∣ceiue from the hands of a worthy Knight and his Lady, a certaine blasphemous Pamphlet (put into their hands by Se∣ducers) intitled, A humble Appeale to his most Excellent Maiestie, and written by one Iohn Hunt, calling himselfe, A Roman Catholike. This blasphemous Rabshaketh, I find in the sixt Chapter of his Pamphlet, formally and vnauoyd∣ably

(I say formally and vndeniably) blaspheming our most Glorious God. (God bee mercifull to mee in repeating the words:) These are his words, That the God of the Protestants (whom he knowes to be Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost) is the most vnciuill and euill-mannered God, of all those, who haue borne the names of gods vpō earth: yea worse then Pan, God of the Clownes, which can indure no Ceremonies, nor Good manners at all: Reading these, with diuers such like, my bowels trembled within me, and my zeale for the Lord was set on fire, and I said vnto my Soule, Spare no arrowes, but shoot against Babylon, for that shee hath sinned against the Lord: And I say more againe, Anathema, Maran-atha, to him whose zeale for the Lord, is not with such blasphemies incensed and set on fire, against the blasphemers. I dare not once suspect that Royall Maiestie (though the blasphemous Pamphlet be dedicated presumptuously to it) or Parla∣lament-Excellency, or Senate-Integrity of this Chri∣stian-State hath euer had any speciall notice or informa∣tion of so blasphemous a Pamphlet; formerly in time of Conniuency, and yet still (to the ioy of the Aduersaries, and vnspeakable scandall of the Pious and Godly) hun∣ting vp and downe this Kingdome: Arise, O God, and put into the knowledge, and heart of our Soueraign, to auenge such thy blasphemous Aduersaries, and all their witting Abettors with deserued reproach, Amen! Wee pray againe; Arise, O Lord, and auenge thy owne Cause, and as dust before the face of the wind, so scatter thou the Enemies of thy Glorious name, Amen, Amen.
And so humbly praying, the God of Truth, to make you all perfect in the knowledge and loue of Truth; I

rest a reuerent Euer-admirer of your Admirable lear∣ning in Truth: and humbly pray, that wee all may bee zealous Euer-imitators, of our Glorious and Angel-like Predecessours, for the Reformation and constant defence of that Pietie and Truth, The Testimony of IESVS, Amen.
