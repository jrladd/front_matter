I HERE present You with a Ser∣mon, which was first Preach'd (with∣out any design of being made Publick) and is now Printed, wholly in compliance with Your desire.
You, who know how few hours were al∣lotted me for the Composure, will di∣spence with it Read, as well as Heard, although it be no Polite and Elaborate Discourse; and for others, that are less Candid, I am not Solicitous.
Plain and useful are the Characters I affect, if it may be any ways Instrumental to promote the good estate of their Souls
who peruse it, and serve to express a real Gratitude for Your Favours, it will fully answer my Design; who daily pray for your Temporal and Spiritual Wellfare in this World, and Your Eter∣nal Happiness in the next; and am,
SIR,
