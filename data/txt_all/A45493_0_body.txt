Right Honourable,
THE present Juncture of our Affairs is such, that nothing but the most active Zeal for our Re∣ligion, the most constant Loyalty to the King, and the firmest Ʋnion among our selves, can (without a Miracle) secure this Church and King∣dom.
The design of the following Dis∣course is to recommend these great indi∣spensable Duties, and to root out all those Lusts and Passions, which are destru∣ctive of true Religion or Human Socie∣ty, and apt to foment Intestine Divisions or Forreign Ʋsurpations: God grant that in this our Day, we may yet know the things that belong to our Peace, the preservation of his Majesties Person and Government, and the conti∣nuance of the true Reformed Religion among us.
I am Right Honourable,
