Gentlemen,
I Have made bold to prefix your Names to the ensuing Discourse, but I have not any of the ordinary Reasons for Dedica∣tions to alledge for my self. I pretend not to Cancel old Obligations, nor seek for Prote∣ction from Censures; but the truth is (and a free Confession shall Attone I hope in some measure for my presumption) that being de∣sirous
to do all the Honour I could to the School I belong to, and all the right I could to the Argument I undertook, I knew no better way, then to produce your Names in your present Station, as so many Worthy Mem∣bers of the one, and so many Living Ex∣amples of the other.
