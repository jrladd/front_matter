BEing willing, a∣mongst
others of
my Function, to
performe some
office to the glory of Gods
people, & considering with
my selfe the times we liue
in, together with our owne
frailties: I haue in that re∣gard
(most vertuous Lady)
labored to compose a small
volume of short Prayers

and to contriue it into this
Method; assuring my selfe
that nothing is or can be
more acceptable to Al∣mightie
God, then the har∣tie
Prayers of his people.
In which Collection I
haue also inserted three
most sweete Prayers, made
by the late Queene Eliza∣beth
of famous memorie.
Which as vpon her occasi∣ons
she powred forth before
the Lord, (as it is written of
King Salomon) kneeling on
her knees, & stretching of her
hands to heauen: so I thought
them most worthy to be re∣gistred
for perpetuall me∣morie,
being compiled by

so renowned a person as her
selfe, and carying in matter
pithe, in stile Maiestie, and
in words true deuotion.
And vnderstanding of
your Graces loue of vertue,
with the humblenesse of
your minde, and zeale of
seruing God, I am therefore
enboldened in the fore∣head
of this my Myte, to
stampe your royall Name:
not doubting of your Gra∣ces
fauourable allowance.
Which being my humble
suite and desire, & crauing
pardon for this boldnesse, I
cease not as heartily to pray
that the manifold graces of
the most High may be mul∣tiplyed

vpon your Estate,
and your Grace long pre∣serued
to the ioy and com∣fort
of your most roiall Pa∣rents
(our Soueraigne King
and Queene) the good of
Gods Church, and the fi∣nall
saluation of your owne
soule.
