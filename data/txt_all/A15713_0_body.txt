RIght Noble Impe.
THose little creatures the Silk-wormes, shunning duality of meates, and betak∣ing themselues wholy to the fresh leasage of the Mulberie tree, frame (by Natures instinct and vertue of the Plant) so faire, and so sweet a webbe, that the greatest personage will not thinke much to weare it. I am the mea∣nest of the seruants of God, farre lesse than the least of his mercies: yet by the operati∣on of his blessed spirit (the soule of my soule) and the efficacie of his holy word (whereon alone I wish to feede) I trust I haue shaped such a garment as the best Christian will not disdaine to put on. A Mourning Garment it is: For lighter colours beseeme not Gods Childe in this carelesse Age, where Ladye Faith goes bare-foote (alas) all alone, atten∣ded by no good workes, which makes her wash handkerchers in her teares.
I present this vesture to your Lordship, not
 doubting but you will accept it, and adorne your selfe with it. And I desire it may be a token of a dutifull and thankfull minde, for the numberlesse fauours our happy vnhappy name hath receiued from your most noble, and for zeale of religion most worthie An∣cestors.
The Lord blesse your Honor, that as you growe in stature, and yeares, so you may growe in grace and fauouor with God, and men.
