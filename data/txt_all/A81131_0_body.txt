WHen I was called by your voice to prepare this Sermon, your affairs were much unsetled, and so were the hearts of most about them. This (besides the everlasting usefullnesse of the subject) was one speciall mo∣tive leading me to this Text and these Meditations; It hath pleased God, since that, to shine very graciously upon your Counsels, and to prosper Those Heroes who act abroad by your Orders and Authority, with a∣mazing successes: which raise this hope, that God instead of punishing, is healing our unbelief; as also that (pos∣sibly) this Sermon hath had (through his blessing) a hand in helping on the cure. When the woman touched Christ by faith, he quickly perceived that vertue was gone out of him: while we cannot but perceive that
 much vertue is gone out from Christ, in giving our late Victories; may we not conclude, that some body hath touched him? Faith may justly be sirnamed Long-hand, it can reach to Heaven. And one battell wonne by the hand of faith reaching Heaven, is more glorious then a thousand by an earthly naked sword. We read (Num. 21. 14.) of an ancient record (of which there are now no remains but that mention) whose Title-page, is, The Book of the warres of the Lord. And why the warres of the Lord? Surely, because the Lord engaged for his people in those warres. What ever else may, the actings of holy faith will engage the Lord. Act faith, and then the records of these times (on your side) shall bear thus to all posterity, The Book of the warres and counsels of the Lord. If these words preached have had, or print∣ed, shall yet give any advantage toward such a Title of your Acts and Monuments, in the great work of our Nationall establishment, you have the desires and ends, which lye next to the glory of God, in the heart of,
Sirs,
