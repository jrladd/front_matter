VNknowne to you I am, yet knowne I am
To th' better part of you, your vertuous name;
Which like a precious odour hath infus'd
Your loue so much in me, as I haue chus'd
Your selfe, to patronize what I haue writ,
Whose name I thought had power to shelter it.
I grant indeed, Smooth Sic tereti cursu repetit spiracu∣la montis Aquila, quae valles spernit, vt alta petat. Sol radios mit∣tit, radios{que} re∣flectit ocellis; Aquila sis vis semper (Amice) tuo. Alcyat. in Emblem. Sa. ibid. Plin. in Nat. Hist. Aelian. ibid. Greg. in Mor. expo. in Iob. Eagle for your name,
Includes that Sun-reflecting (Anagram)
These birds which in my Odes their fates display,
Are some night-birds, as others of the day;
Which in my iudgement, tenders more delight,
To see how sin's orecurtained by night,
Whereas the day sends forth his golden raies,
And shewes such birds as chant their makers praise.
Which Morall, as it suites these times of ours,
I do disclaime my right in't, it is yours,
If you esteeme it worthie to obtaine
Your approbation: This is all our ayme.

R. B.
