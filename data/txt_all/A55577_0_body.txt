Most Honoured Sirs,
THE favourable Acceptance you give to all those who, according to your Institution, are studious to increase both Natural Knowledge, and the Commodities of Humane Life, hath encouraged me to present you with these Experiments as my best Endeavours to follow your Example: I confess they are nothing near deserving to be offered to such sagacious Wits; but I have seen how quickly and easily you distinguish between good and bad in all manner of Writings, and how kindly you bear with the defects of those whose designs are good; I hope therefore you will be pleased to honour this small Treatise with your Protection, and give me leave to profess my self with all imaginable Respect,
Most Honoured SIRs,
