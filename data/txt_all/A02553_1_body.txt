MAdame, I knowe your Christian in∣genuti such, that you will not grudge others the communication of this your priut right: which ye I durst not haue presumed to aduenture, if I feared that either the benefit of it

would be lesse, or the accep∣tation. Now it shall be no lesse yours, onely it shall be more knowne to be yours. Vouchsase therefore to take part with your worthy hus∣band, of these my simple Meditations. And if your long and gracious experi∣ence, haue written you a larger volume of wholsome lawes, and better informed you by precepts fetcht from your owne eeling, then I can hope for, by my bre speculation, yet where these my not vnlikely rules shall accord with yours, let your redoubled assent allow thē, and they cōfirme it. I made

them not for the eye, ut for the heart; neither doo I cō∣mend thē to your reading, but your practise: wherein also it shall not be enough, that you are a meere and ordinary agent, but that you be a patterne propoun∣ded vnto others imitation: so shall your vertuous and holy progresse, besides your owne peace and happinesse, be my crowne, and reioy∣cing in the day of our com∣mon appearance. Halsted. Dec. 4.
