SIR, though I know, you euer stood little affected to these vnprofitable rites of Dedication; (which disposi∣tion in you, hath made me hetherto dispence with your right in my o∣ther impressions) yet, least the world may repute it a neglect in me, of so ancient and worthy a friend; (hauing heard your ap∣probation of these in their presentment) I could not but prescribe them with your name; And that my affection may extend to your Posteritie, I haue enti∣tled to it, herein, your hope and comfort in your ge∣nerous sonne; whom I doubt not, that most reuerenc'd Mother of Manly Sciences; to whose instruction your vertuous care commits him; will so profitably initiate in her learned labours, that they will make him florish in his riper life, ouer the idle liues of our ignorant Gentlemen; and enable him to supply the Honorable places, of your name; extending your yeares, and his right noble Mothers (in the true comforts of his ver∣tues) to the sight of much, and most happy Progenie; which most affectionately wishing; and diuiding these poore dismemberd Poems betwixt you, I desire to liue still in your gracefull loues; and euer,
