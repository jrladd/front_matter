Gentlemen,
THE general Joy and Thankfulness which have ap∣pear'd throughout the Kingdom, upon the discovery and defeat of the late Designs of France against Us, make me hope that the Eyes of this People, which some have been so busie to put out, by all the Dust they could raise, are at last clear'd; and that many well-meaning Per∣sons, who have been misled by the Cunning of such as lie in wait to deceive, do now begin to see that after all the pretences of Honour on the other side the Water, and Con∣science on this, the Question is come to this short Issue, Whether we will live like a Free-People under our English Laws and Government which have been so bravely asserted by our Ancestors, and enjoy our Reform'd Religion, which has been seal'd with the Blood of Martyrs, of our Spiritual Fathers and Brethren in Christ; or, Exchange these for a French Servitude and Papal Bondage, and bring a Yoke upon our selves and Posterity, which neither we nor our Fathers have been able to bear?
This You and your Worthy Citizens were certainly sen∣sible of, when upon the late Thanksgiving-Day for the De∣liverance of His Majesty and these Kingdoms from the designed Assassination and Invasion You appear'd in such Numbers in the House of God, and exprest your respect to it in such Instances as have scarcely been parallell'd, upon any occasion, in this place.

I heartily wish, That my Health and Leisure would have permitted me to have made that part of the Solemnity that fell to my share of a Piece with the others; and that when all the rest deserv'd to be set in as bright a Light as that with which You illuminated your Streets upon the Evening of that Joyful Day, it only might not have wanted a Veil to cover it.
But, however needful it may be, I am sure I must not offer at any Apology for making it publick: None can be made on my part, but what may be answer'd in those words of St. Peter to Ananias, While it remain'd with thee was it not thine own? And as to You, Gentlemen, Now it is yours (tho' You may wish that I had made such a return to your Commands as the Elder Brother did to those of his Father in the Gospel, who said, Sir, I go, and did not, rather than with the second, profest my unwillingness to comply, and afterwards repented and did it) You must be contented to account for it, to take it wholly upon your selves, and not expect that I should say one word for it, for that would be unwarily to intitle my self to its Defence, when I can so fairly rid my hands of it, and lay it at your Doors.
If any of those good Ends shall be served by Printing it, which You spoke of when You honoured me with a Visit the Day after it was Preach'd, I shall think it but reaso∣nable that the acknowledgments thereof should be made only to You, who must bear all the ill Consequences of it, as having commanded it from me by your Authority, which I do own is very great over,
Worcester, Apr. 20. 1696.
