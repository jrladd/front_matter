Right Worshipfull,
I Here present you with the Works, that is, with the actions and wri∣tings of your great Uncle, Sir Francis Vere; unto which as you have a right by bloud, common to some others with you; so have you also right by purchase, proper and peculiar to your self a∣lone, having freely contributed to adorn the Im∣pression, wherein you have consulted as the Rea∣ders delight and satisfaction, so the honour and reputation of your family. I have read of one, that used to wear his fathers picture alwaies a∣bout him, that by often looking thereon he might be reminded to imitate his vertues, and to admit of nothing unworthy the memory of such an Ancestour; Now Sir, I think you shall not need any other monitour then your own name, if but as often as you write it, or hear it spoken, you recall into your thoughts those your Proge∣nitours, who contributed to it; your Honoured

father, Sir Roger Townshend, and your Grand∣father the truly Honourable and valiant the Lord Vere of Tilbury, men famous in their ge∣nerations for owning religion, not onely by pro∣fession, but also by the practise and patronage of it; whose vertues while you shall make the pat∣tern of your imitation, you will increase in fa∣vour with God and men, and answer the just expectations of your countrey. And that you may so do it is the earnest desire, and hearty prayer of
Sir,
