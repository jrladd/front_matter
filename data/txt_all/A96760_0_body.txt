THe said Petitioner hath suffered so much and so long, by trusting to the Publick faith of this Nation, and their Securities given by Act of Parliament, that it hath much impaired his Estate and Credit, and so multiplied his troubles and grievances per∣tinent to your Cognizance in order to his Relief, that, he dares not offer them in this Petition, lest it prove so large, that at first view it may infringe your patience. Therefore, he is constrained to make way by this Previous Address, adjoyning thereto an humble Narrative of some part of his sad sufferings, with a Series of his Cause, as briefly Epitomized as above 16 years Oppressions would permit; which Narrative he prays your Honours (as you desire GOD should be propitious to you, and those whom you represent) to take into speedy consideration, lest Redress either come too late, or may cost twice so much as will relieve him at this present: For, it will be no Injustice to take Cognizance of those Causes out of Course, that will else be∣come remedilesse, or so hazardous by delay, as this Petitioners will be if deferred, whom perhaps, GOD hath permitted to be so incumbred and insnared, as well for some ends relating to the Publick, or to his own Glory, as for the said Petitioners correction
Justice and Mercy are the chief supports and Ornaments of Kingdoms and Republicks; and the great Body, which your Honours represent, consists of Individuals, whose preservation being neglected One by One, the Whole will be at last consumed. Otherwhiles also Justice neglected, or Injustice done to private men, occasions Plagues to be inflicted on States and Publick persons; and it may be it hath so succeeded within our knowledge: For the five last Parliaments did shut private Complaints so long out of this House, to the remedilesse destruction of many, that those Parliaments were at last shut out of it, and destroyed. Peradventure likewise, that GOD, who alone can make men to be of One minde in a House, will not re∣pair our breaches, untill failings be expiated by more acceptable oblations then such cheap and easie Sacrifices, as formal fastings: Even by some signal Acts of Justice and Mercy, seasonably, and impartial∣ly performed for relief of persons extreamly and notoriously oppressed; among whom, if there be any whose present condition deserves more compassion then this Petitioners, he is contented they should be first relieved.
Your Honours will not wholly loose your time, or labour, in hearing the annexed Narrative, or the proofs of the Petitioners Allegations which he shall produce: For, his sufferings being well weighed with the advantages which he hath had in several respects, more then many other oppressed men to vindicate his Cause, and that he hath notwithstanding been hitherto without relief; your Wisdoms may thereby ob∣serve, the sad constitution of these times, and conjecture the miserable condition whereto many thou∣sands of the faithfull servants of this Commonwealth have been exposed, who had lesse means to make known their Oppressions; and thence also may collect what is likely to be the sequel.
Therefore, he again beseecheth your Honours (notwithstanding the length thereof) to take the said Narrative into speedy consideration, and to grant the several Requests thereto subjoyned, as in Justice, Equity, or Compassion you shall finde cause; that GOD, who sheweth Mercie to the Mercifull, may free you from your Incumbrances, and so prosper your consultations, that all future Generations may call you BLESSED; to which end this Petitioner will continue his prayers.
