SIR,
THe good offices you have often done, for many
godly Ministers, and (by them) to the Church
of God in this Nation, Done, not by the
importunity of Petitioners (spurred on by
necessity) but with the alacrity of your inge∣nious
and generous spirit, nor with any, either expectation
or desire of a Fee before-hand, or a gratuity afterwards,
have deeply ingaged them, highly to honour you, and hear∣tily
to pray for you, so much the more, as they have the
less manifested their thankfulness by any reall returns: and
that by your Antipathy to them, not by their oblivion of
them, or unwillingness to tender them to your acceptance;
for (on my Knowledge) divers of them had a consultation
to present you with a joynt testimony of their gratitude,
though not answerable, either to your merit, or their own

mindes, but I diverted them from that intention, by telling
them, (which I had in effect though not in terminis,
from your own mouth) that the success and satisfaction of
your endeavours was sufficient content to you, and that
you were resolute not to receive any thing, which looked
like a Reward for what you had done; and by that little
acquaintance and conference I had with your Colleague Mr I,
I had cause to account him your Brother Benevolence to∣wards
objects of charity in the like kinde. I will adde one
observation more, of a subordinate Officer to you both, who
notwithstanding his great pains, and quick dispatch of a
business of much concernment to the peace and comfort of
the Ministry, when a just salary of his service was offered,
shut his hands as close against it, and more seriously then
any Capochin Frier would do, against an oblation of white
or yellow Mammon, tendred unto him. This especially, as
compared with the contrary disposition in others, gave me
occasion, for a time, to pause upon the comparison of the
precedent and present times. 2. To praise God for our
happy change for the better, in that particular; and . To
give this publique Testimony to your Charity and Integri∣ty,
in the name of my self and of many of my Brethren,
whose Benefactor you have been, as the Right Honourable
Senators of the Court our Patrons, and his Highness our
Protector, of whose favour, some of us happly would not
be found altogether unworthy, if what we have done and
suffered for the Service and Safety of the Publique, were
as well known, as the benefit and countenance we have
received from our Superiours, either while the long Parlia∣ment
sate, or since (as too long) it was put to a Nonplus.
But the relation of this will neither sort with our modesty
to write, nor with your many and pnderous mployments to
reade, who have fewer spare minutes, then most others

have spare hours or daies; therefore (leaving these Pole∣micall
Papers to your best leasure for perusal) I will only
take leave of you, with the application of the praier of
Nehemiah for himself, to your condition and ours, The
Lord your God and ours remember you, and wipe not
out your good deeds which you have done for the
House of your God, and the Offices thereof: This is the
sincere and hearty Prayer of,
Solyhull,
June 18, 1656.
Sir, Your most faithfull,
affectionate and humble servant,
