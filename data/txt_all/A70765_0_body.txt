Sir,
A Brest Fortified with Loyalty is the CITY of Refuge this Worke flyes to, whereof your Noble Selfe being Governour, it craves with Boldnesse a Gracious Entrance, and doubts not of your Favou∣rable Protection. If my particular Duty did not engage me, your Noble Worth would soone Invite me to Dedicate my Labours to your Honourable Patro∣nage; for who shall better Patronize that Worke whose Subject is Loyalty, than he who is a Loyall Subject? who better
encourage the Pen in the Cause of Kings, than he, who with Glory hath engaged his Sword in the Kings Cause? But Sir, I will not detract from your Worth by presuming to declare it; being a thing bet∣ter known by your Actions, than I can expresse by Words. Onely this; whilest this CITY gloryes so much in being under your Government, the Souldiers under your Command, give the Scholler leave to glory in being under your Patronage. Goe on Sir in your Loyalty to the Crown, and God shall Crown your Loyalty, let your aime still be Gods Glo∣ry and your Soveraignes Honour; and that shall make for your Soules Happy∣nesse, and this Kingdomes Peace. Sir,
York, March the 10. 1642.
