HAVING receaued so singuler benefites from you, as needes I must, (more then to any o∣ther earthly creatures) acknowledge my selfe indebted to you; and hauing from you receued both the copie, the counsail, and other commodities, to translate this woorthie Treatise into our English tongue; I could doo no lesse, as-wel in respect of your for∣mer merits, as of the means you gaue me, to attempt and finish this worke, but make you the Patrones of my smal paines, and vowe the cote and simple attire to them, who gaue the mould, and soueraine subiect to me. God graūt my skil haue answered to my wil, then shal I without al affec|

haue translated that into plaine, and not impure Englishe, which was first written by a woorthy Father of your company, in plaine and right pure I∣taliā. Accept therfore, Reuerend Fa∣thers, and Brethren, a birde of your owne broode, plucked out of her na∣tural plume, and garnished with for∣reine fether. Accept this my seelie trauaile, as a testimonie of a reuerent zeale, I bear to your whole Socieite; and as a  of further re∣warde I owe you: which our good God, hauing geuen you his worde for me, wil furnish you most aboun∣dantlye. He preserue, increase, and strengthen you for euer; and graunt me and al others grace to folow your good instructions.
At Paris, the. 20. of June. 1579,
