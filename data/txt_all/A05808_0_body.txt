ALthough that the sōdry & diners sortes of prymers (my special good Lord & singular frend) here before set forth as wel (in many thinges) supersticions, as derogatyue vnto the true honour of god, might haue enforced (and dyd in dede) me to haue desyred a syncere correccion herein, yet the feruent desyre that I perceyue in your lordeshyp to ye true honour of God, the vnite & weale of the Christian cominalte, hath much more (as the prourrbe sayeth) set the spurre vnto the hasty runner & in maner compelled me to shewe som token of my dewe seruyce toward gods honour, and towarde your fauourable goodnes, in settynge forth this rude and symple worke, as vnto whom your much and manyfolde fauour hath constrayned & bound me, next vnto almyghty god & my souerayne Lorde the kyng, to your prest & assidious seruyce al my lyfe dayes. And for as much as we haue of tyme in experience that a worke taketh no smale estimacion wt the commen people, both of the aucthor and specially of him vnto whom it is dedicated. For this cause haue I this my rude and grosse enterpryse dedicated vnto your lordeshyppes name, nod because I thought it to be so exquisite and of so exacte a iudge∣ment (as the learned wold desyre) & worthy of so wyse & learned a patrone, but rather commyttyng it to the most wysest iudgemēt of the kynges most sapient councell, wherof ye are, that yf so be it sholde seme vnto the same a thynge worthy or mete to be had in common vsage, then by the iudgement of the same approued, it myght the rather and with the more auidite be receyued of the pe¦ple, yf not, yet to be a tokē of my poore good wyl, and desyre that I bare vnto such a thyng to be done of som other, that are of more perfect iudgement and lyterature, and also to be a token of the of fyce and seruyce that I owe vnto goddes syncere honour and to your lordeshyppes sauourable goodnes.
