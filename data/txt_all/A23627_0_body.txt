My Lord,
THAT this Treatise waited
for a share in the Cere∣mony
of receiving your Lordship

from Venice, Arguments are not
wanting; for besides the Interest
that I bear by living within your
Influence, There is a common
Obligation to appear in the ge∣neral
Train of those that grate∣fully
attend your Return from
your Embassy, from a just Sense
of the Blessings these Kingdoms
receive from your Employment,
and your Country by your Re∣turn
and Presence. But that I
inscribe it to your Lordship's
Name, I am more necessarily▪ in∣duced,
in that it is not easie to
find so fit a Patron and so great
a Judge: Your Greatness that
impowers you to countenance a
Book, hath a Brightness more
than common to your own Qua∣lity,
and hath all the Worth and

Beauty, that Integrity, Virtue
and Goodness can give it. As
a Judge how you are Qualify'd,
I shall not attempt; but only
observe your Lordships excellent
Temper to be so great a Help,
as that just Notions of things
are not to be had without. As
a Character is better waved, Ju∣stice
being seldom done in De∣dications;
so I am happy that
it is not the least part of your
Character, that your Excellencies
have a Foundation above that of
common Applause. However
you need it not, I had the Hon∣our
to observe your Lordships
first Years, possess'd of the Esteem
of one who had a Fame for
Learning, among those that are
acknowledged to be the greatest

Masters of it in Europe; and now
your Riper ones in the nearest
Imployment of the greatest of
Princes.
The Subject, My Lord, gives
you a Right to it; who accounts
the noblest Subject is to know a
Man's self, and who makes the
Practise of doing Good your Plea∣sure:
And the Touches I have
given at Humane Nature, your
Lordship's several Travels abroad
have given you a particular Pa∣late
for. I have offer'd somewhat
at the two grand Problems, the
Mechanism of Life, and Use of
Respiration, and at the Distinct
Notion of Humane Nature. But
I own the Thoughts are shatter'd,
and not exact, What your Good

Opinion Supports, I shall set
above the Rate of common Esti∣mation;
so what your Judgment
condemns, shall lose all Value and
Concern with me: However it
gives me an Opportunity to sig∣nifie,
that I am,
My Lord,
