RIGHT VVorshipfull and renoumed Knight: It hath happened of late, I know not how; whether by my folly, or fortune, to commit some of my labours to the presse. VVhich (the weaker the work is) haue more need of an Honorable Patron. Euery thing perswades mee, (though they seeme not absolute) that your Countenance is a sufficient warrant for them against sharp tongues & vnfriendly censures; Knowing your rare ver∣tues, and honorable accomplishments to be such: as may iustly challenge their better regard and opinion, whome it shall please you to Patronize. If per∣chance they shall proue worthie your patronage: My affection, dutie, and good will, bind mee rather to Dedicate them to you, then to any other: both for the reuerence, & honour I owe to all other your most singuler vertues; and especially also for your excellent skill in Musicke, and your great loue and fauour of Musicke. There remaineth onely your fauorable acceptance, which humbly crauing at your hands, with protestation of all dutie, and seruice: I humbly take my leaue. From th' Augustinè Fryers the XII. of Aprill. 1598.
