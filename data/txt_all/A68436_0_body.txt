AFTER that I had bestowed both paynes, trauaile and charges (Right honourable) aboute the reducyng of this delightfull Historie of Gerileon into this our mother tongue, and had therein vsed the aduise and conference of sundrie my freendes, I was aswell by their counsaill embolde∣ned, as otherwise of myne owne nature, willyng, to presente and consecrate the first fruites therof (by waie of Dedication) vnto your good and honourable Lordship. The Historie it self beyng firste written in Frenche, was (in deede) for the greater parte thereof, after a kynde of sorte, translated by a certaine yonge man, more hardie and venturous in attempte, then luckie and Fortunate in atchieuaunce; whose good meaning, as it semeth to merite pardon, and perhappes some thankes: so vppon further scrutinie, examination, and conference of the copie with his Translation, it was easie to finde where he had tripped, and where (vnawares) he had vtterly loste his waie. Wherevpon I was driuen to sustaine a double labour: One in perfectyng his imperfections: The other in finishyng and sup∣plying that parte of the Booke, where he had abruptly brokē of, and absurdlie skipped ouer. And for that the copie thereof (commyng at the firste into my handes by chaunce emong other thynges) was so farced with prodigious phrases, and so apparauntly halted in sense and vnderstandyng, I caused the
same to bee repervsed, and looked ouer anewe, that no dili∣gence should want, wherein my industrie might any thyng a∣uaile. Which labour and trauaile I humbly dedicate vnto your Honour: not doubting, but that as the Booke it self shall som∣what dignifie your worthie person, and emblazon your re∣noumed fame: so againe, that it shall bee from the bright bea∣mes of your shining vertues, both the better countenaunced, and the freendlier accepted of all worthie yonge Gentlemen, delightyng in Cheualrie, Martiall exploites, and suche amou∣rous discourses, as are tolerablie incident to the greene Prime of youthfull yeres. In fine, herein is verie aptly shadowed out, a perfecte type of Dame Vertues Pilgrimage, whose naturall course, vsuall trade, and ordinarie happe, is through many sharpe daungers, bruntes, and aduentures, to purchase the gole of honour and renoume in this life, and afterwarde a Croune of immortall Fame and glorie in the life to come: vnto the whiche I humblie beseche Almightie GOD, after many yeres heere happely besto∣wed, to bryng your good Lordship.
