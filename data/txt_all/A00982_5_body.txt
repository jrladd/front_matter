NIne Worthies were described long agone,
And as forgotten are intumbed dead:
No Monument remaines of any one,
Though they were Shrined better then in Lead:
But Iosua, Dauid, Macchabeus be
In Bible booked for first Worthies three.
Next in that Ranke (and so the number nine)
Were Iulius, Alexander Macedon,
Hector of Troy, and Godfrey-de-Boloigne,
Arthur of Britaine, Charles King Pepins sonne.
In other bookes their Stories written are;
With whom eight HENRIES welnigh may coÌ„pare.
The ninth, in hope more worthy then the eight:
Vpon whose shoulders wisest heads haue hurld
Of future honour a farre greater weight,
Applauded of Europa, and the World.
Besides all these, one Worthy more I sing;
The worthiest of Worthies, IAMES our King.
