SIR, the Loue (which your immor∣tall Ariosto tels to the world) that you really beare to Diuine, (but now Poore and Contemned) Poesie, hath a long time made me an Honorer of those bright ascen∣ding Vertues in you, which those Holy and Pure Flames of Her haue kindled in your bo∣some. Happy you are by Birth, Happy, by your bringing vp, but most happy in that the Muses were your Nurses, to whome you haue beene so tender, that they make you an Elder sonne and Heyre of their Goodliest Possessions. So that your Loue to Them, hath drawne from Others, an Honourable Loue and Regarde of you. The Path which True Noblenesse had wont (and ought) to tread, lyes directly before you: you haue beene euer, and are now in the way, which emboldens me to presume, that as our Greatest Commanders will not disdaine to instruct e∣uen Fresh-water souldiers in the Schoole-poynts of war, so (out of your Noble disposition) you will vouchsafe to viewe the labours of so dull a Pen, as This that writes, vnto you. Two Citties haue I summoned to a Parley, and of their great Enter-view haue I chosen you to be Arbi∣ter. It is Boldnes in me, I confesse, but it is the Boldnes, of my Loue, referring which (and my selfe) to your wor∣thy Censure, I Rest.
