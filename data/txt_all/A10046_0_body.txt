MOST GRATIOVS PRINCE with all reverence and de∣votion, I present to your Highnesse this labour. To whom shoulde I dedicate it? But to your Princelie goodnes, to whose service I haue consecrated my tongue, and pen, and heart, and all the offices of my life: it is an answer to a revolted late Minister, a busines (I may say) imposed me, by some, of very ho∣norable respect, & much encouraged by o∣thers, especially the most Reverend Archbi∣shop: our late Chancelour. It is the maintenance of truth, O let it receiue countenance from the
 royall heire apparant of the defender of the truth. The infection of Popery spreads too farre: some come not to our Church, others fly our Land and Church, both revile and slander the Church. The eies, and harts, and hopes of all the Protestant world, be fixed vpon your Highnesse, all expecting your Gracious faith∣fulnes, & readines in the extirpation of that man of sinne. March valiantly herein, Most Gracious Prince, and the God of Princes shall protect you, his Grace and Providence shall reward your faith and Confidence, and shall heape vpon your Highnesse, favor, and honor, and glory, in both worldes. For which, as long as I haue being, I shall never cease praying.
