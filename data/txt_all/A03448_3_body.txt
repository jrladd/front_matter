HAuing by your singular curtesie receyued great helpe in my description of the riuers and streames of Britain, and by conference of my trauaile vvith the platformes of those fevv shires of England vvhich are by your infi∣nite charges alreadie finished (as the rest shall be in time by Gods helpe, for the inestimable benefite of suche as inhabite this Ilande) not a little pullished those rough courses of diuerse vvaters not exactly before time de∣scribed by Leland our Countreyman, or any auncient vvriter, I coulde not deuise anye thing more agreable vvith mine abilitie & your good nature (vvhich great∣ly fauoureth anye thing that is done for a commoditie vnto many) than to shevv some token of my thankefulnesse for these your manifold kindnesses, by the dedication of my simple translation of the description of Scotland at this tyme vnto your vvorship. In deede the trauaile taken herein is not great, by∣cause I tie not my translation vnto his letter, neither the treatise of it selfe such, as ta∣keth vp any huge rovvme in the volume of this Chronicle. But such as it is, & vvhat soeuer it is, I yeeld it vvholy vnto you, as a testimonie of my good vvill, vvhich de∣testeth vtterly to receyue any benefit though it be neuer so smal, and not to be thank∣full for it. Certes my vocation is such, as calleth me to a farre other kind of studie, so that I exercise these things onely for recreation sake: and to say the truth, it is muche vnsitting for him that professeth Diuinitie, to applie his time any other vvise vnto contemplation of ciuill Histories. And this is the cause vvherfore I haue chosen ra∣ther, onely vvith the losse of three or foure dayes to translate Hector out of the Scot∣tish (a tongue verie like vnto ours) than vvith more expence of time to diuise a nevve, or follovv the Latin copie, vvhich is farre more large and copious. Hovv excellently if you consider the arte, Boethus hath penned it and the rest of his Historie in the La∣tin, the skilfull are not ignorant: but hovv profitably and compendiously Iohn Bel∣lendon Archdeacon of Murrey his interpretour hath turned him from the Latin into the Scottish tongue, there are verie fevve English men that knovv, bycause vve want the bookes. VVherefore sith the learned reade him in his ovvne stile, and his Coun∣treymen in their naturall language, vvhy should not vve borovv his description and read the same in English likevvise, sith the knovvledge thereof may redounde to the great benefit of so many as heare or read the same. Accept therefore (right vvorship∣full) this my simple offer, and although I assure my selfe, your naturall inclination to be such, as that it vvill take nothing in ill part that is vvell meant tovvard you, hovve rudely soeuer it bee handled in the doing, yet I vvill not let to craue pardon for my presumption, in that I dare be so bold as to offer such a trifle vnto you, whom more vveightie affayres doe dayly call from things of so small impor∣taunce. Almightie God keepe your vvorship from time to time in his feare, and blesse you and my good Ladie your vvife, vvith such increase of his benefites, as may most redounde to his glorie, and your ovvne ad∣uauntage.
