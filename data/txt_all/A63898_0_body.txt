Right Honourable,
I Have presumed in Obedience to the Com∣mands of my Superiours, which are a Law to me, and ought to be so to every Honest man, to publish the following Discourse; in which adventure I am so far from having any o∣ther Motive than that of perfect Submission to all the lawful injunctions of Authority, that if I had been only to consult mine own inclination, I think I should have deferred it till some far∣ther
 time; for otherwise I will not deny, but that I did design this and somewhat more upon this Subject should appear abroad, out of some hope which I have, that as the Subject its self which I have undertaken will be very season∣able and suitable to the present juncture of time, so also that what I have to suggest upon it may not be altogether unuseful or unaccepta∣ble to the World, or at least to that part of it, which has either the patience to hear Reason or the Justice to suffer themselves to be di∣rected by it.
However it may be a certain Argument, that I have no other Design than that of Obe∣dience to Your Lordship, and the Honourable Court, that what I have now exposed to the View of the Publick, is an Imperfect thing, as will sufficiently appear by the perusal of the Sermon its self, which leaves one of the par∣ticulars proposed in a great measure uncon∣sidered, I mean, that Second Head of the Feast of Ʋnleavened Bread, which will con∣tain these Two Particulars, First, of the Time, and Secondly of the Nature of that
 Last supper, which our Saviour Celebrated with his Disciples; which being a Disquisi∣tion of a Philological nature, and so not al∣together so proper for the Pulpit, I have the confidence to hope, that what I have perform∣ed upon This Occasion may seem the less de∣fective for its want of that part.
Such as it is, I do here in most Humble manner Present it to Your Patronage and Protection, Hoping for Your kind and fa∣vourable Acceptance, And am,
Right Honourable,

LONDON, October 27. 1679.
