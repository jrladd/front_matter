MOST gratious
Princesse; vouch∣safe
(I beseech
you) the remem∣brance
of that du∣ty,
which we owe vnto God for all
his benefits; namely, to take vp
the cup of saluation and call vp∣on
the name of the Lord. This is
the subiect of this smal Treatise.
Which I am the rather embolde∣ned
to present vnto your grace,
because, as the Lord hath renu∣ed
his mercies continually vpon
your princely person, especially

shewed himselfe merueilous in
that your admirable deliuerance
from these bloodie hunters: so
it pleased your highnes to accept
very fauourably the remem∣brance
thereof, and to patronage
my first labors (to that end) with
the prime of your Graces prote∣ction:
which as it hath the rather
bound me to consecrate my selfe
and al my studies to your Graces
deuotion; so doe I in all humble
maner tender vnto your Excel∣lency,
a pledge hereof in these
short meditations; which as they
may bee your daily practise of
thankefulnes to God for all his
mercies toward you: so will they
also proue verie profitable di∣rections
for the information of
your tender yeeres in the waies
of God: that so beeing daily
crowned with new blessing, you

may at length be fitted for that
crowne of glory, which the Lord
Iesus hath purchased for you. To
whose blessed protection I doe
most heartily commend
your Highnes: and so
most humbly take
my leaue.
