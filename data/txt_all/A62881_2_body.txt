My Lord,
THERE needs no Apology for my Addressing to Your Grace this Poem in Memory of Your Illustrious and and Immediate Ancestors, who pass'd the Sphere of Life with an uninterrupted Course of Glory.
The Duke of ORMOND (whose Obsequies I have here endeavour'd to Cele∣brate)
was a Prince of such accomplish'd Person and Endowments of Mind, as if Na∣ture in Him had design'd to triumph over Invention, to transcend the most exalted Ideas of Poetry, and to shew the Moralist such an Example of consummate Worth as he had never meet with, but in Speculation.
He seem'd always at his Meridian, what ever he did or said was Great and suitable to his mighty Self.
Wherefore, as a just Reward to his tran∣scendent Merit he surviv'd to see his Noble Genius copy'd in his Son the Illustrious Earl of OSSORY; who, both for Pacifick Virtues and Renown in Arms was likewise an Ornament of the Age in which he liv'd.
The Muses would justly forfeit ther Charter should they refuse their Tribute to the Shrines of such deserving and noble Patrons.

My Lord,
I am sensible that their Encomium is more acceptable toyou than your own, tho' in truth it be the Same, for nothing can be worthily said of them in which you are not Personally concern'd.
Their Fame is as inseparable from You as their Blood, and no less Hereditary than their Titles and Dignity. In Camp and Court, in Publick and Private Respects you have maintain'd their Character to the high∣est pitch of Honour.
This is the least that can be said of Your Grace, which, yet is enough to convince the World that true English Worth and Great∣ness of Soul is not every where expir'd.
And that you may long survive a glo∣rious Example thereof is Implor'd, as
a Publick Blessing, by all true Lovers of their Country, but by none more zealously, than
My Lord,
