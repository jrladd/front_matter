APelles man did all his Wits imploy
To paint the shape of Laedais Daughter faire:
But when he saw his worke prou'd naught, poore Boy,
He wept for woe, and tooke exceeding care:
Then deck'd he her with Iewels rich and rare:
Which when the braue Apelles did behold.
Paint on (quoth hee) poore Boy, and haue no feare,
When Beautie fayles, well done t'enrich with Gold.
I am (faire Princesse) like the Painters man,
As ignorant, as scant of skill as hee:
Yet will J striue and doe the best J can,
To manifest my louing minde to thee.
But to supply the weaknesse of my skill,
In place of Gold (great Lady) take goodwill.
