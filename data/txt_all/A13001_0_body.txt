BAse Vulcans crowne with Laurell to adorne,
That still stands plodding by his Anuills side,
Would make the seely smith be laught to scorn,
And wiser heads the foolish gift deride.


Euen so some Thrasoes fancy to haue fed,
With Muses flowres that know not what they be,
Had bin to bring Silenus Asse a bed,
That vnderstands a rime as well as he.


Which made me consecrate this verse of mine
To him, that can with iudgement reade the same,
Yet stand not too praecize on euery line.
But rather such a web as I could frame
In slender lines, yet slender as they be,
My Muse Arachne-like presents to thee.
