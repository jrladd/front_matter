GOod Madam; I should bee very in∣gratefull, if I should not dedicate the first fruits of any publike labour of mine, how great or small soever, unto some of your Noble Family: from whence I have received, not onely the first, but all the fruits of my present mainte∣nance in the world. And amongst these that doe now sur∣vive, there is none can challenge so great an interest as your Honour: not onely, as you are the present Patro∣nesse of my Living; but in many other personall and particular respects; by which I, and mine, stand more obliged to your Ladiship, than to any others. May you therefore please to accept of this poore paper present: not
 as a satisfaction, but an acknowledgement onely, of my so many great engagements: And withall to let it passe under your Honourable Name and countenance unto the world: it shall much more increase my debt unto you: which seeing I shall have no better meanes and opportu∣nities to pay, I doe hereby promise that the failings and deficiencies thereof, shall be supplied with prayers, for the health and happinesse, not of your selfe alone, but of all your noble issue also; together with the rest of your Family, by him that truly honoureth, and faithfully serveth your Ladiship in the Lord:
