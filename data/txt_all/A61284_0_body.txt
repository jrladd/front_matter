My Beloved and Christian Friends,
IT is the holy Scriptures commendation, That it's written for every Mans Instruction and as there is a mystery of Godliness and Piety, so there is a mystery of Sin and Iniquity; and as there are Mines of Heavenly Treasure, so there are Mine∣rals of Tin and Clay: Now Many are so wrapt in darkness in the depth of Impiety, and others busied la∣bouring in the Earth for Clay, that they have not hitherto discovered the Celestial and hidden Myste∣ries, nor found out the Spiritual Mines of Divine Treasures; which precious things cannot be obtained, unless by Gods holy Spirit a Man be inspired; for
by Divine light a Man must come to discern ever∣lasting Mines and Mysteries, and by the eternal Spirit, which searcheth the hidden and most secret things; And as these are not Matters of Indifferency or Temporary, so they are to be sought with more than ordinary diligence and industry; and for our better guidance, and more sure direction, we must make use of the helps of Divine Inspiration. I can do no lesse but call upon all Christian Professors to be∣take themselves to the Canonical Books of the holy Scriptures; For among all other Benefits and Bene∣dictions, we are to bless God for those holy Writings; for they are the best helps, that are helps in the best things; And as a Mapp directs both to Town and Country, so doth holy Writ discover the Borders and Treasures of the Heavenly and Holy City; indeed they are like a light to our feet, and a lanthorn to our paths, to guide us aright in all Gods pure and holy wayes, and to the finding out of the most choyce and invaluable Riches, far better to the Saints than Pearls and Jewels; for they are more than a Libra∣ry for Instruction, like a Store-house for Soul-provi∣sion, and like a Spiritual Armorie for Munition, where is to be found all manner of heavenly Food for Nutriment, and all kinde of holy Garments for Ornament; I may say, 'tis like an Apotheries shop for Receipts and Remedies, even the most soveraign helps against all in troubles and diseases; such Mine∣rals will make Potions for Soul-sick Patients, which
being skilfully compounded, and carefully applied, may prove effectual Means and powerfull Remedies to expel and drive away most dangerous Distempers. From hence Christians may be directed and provided with Skill and right Judgement, and principled and furnished with Rules for all Order, Discipline and Government, whether it be within the Dominion of Congregational, Personal, or Family Jurisdiction. Besides this, a Man may collect and form an Evi∣dence in order to the claiming an Interest to the ever∣lasting Inheritance. To be be short, here is all varie∣ty of Soul-concernment and Contentment towards the fitting a Mans self, clearing his Assurance for his Eternal Preferment; We may say of the Holy Scrip∣tures in Resolution, as once was said in answer to Circumcision, That they are profitable every way; even to such as order their Lives according to them, have both the promise of this life, and that which is to come. Now as the Sun goes his course, and gives light in his place, and every Star in his order gives some light in his course: So ought every Christian to be a light in his day, with respect to order and place; and as a Member of the Mystical Body I would cast a Mite into the Publick Treasurie; and as one of the unworthy Successors of our antient Fathers, who sent their Epistles to the Believing Churches, I have now an Occasion as well as a Pattern to pre∣sent something to Christs Congregation: Or any Well-wishers who see any thing worth of acceptation,
that may deserve the place of Counsel or Direction, wherein they may see themselves concerned in Consci∣ence, and ingaged in Duties to conform thereunto, according to Scripture-obligations: Now because a Paper-direction may be received, where a Mans Person will be refused; and a Matter printed may be imbraced, where a Sermon cannot be preached; and because the greatest things have the smallest be∣ginnings, and the Lord hath ordained strength out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings, are moving Causes of my entering upon this Work; and so I com∣mit this small Labour to be perused and proved con∣sonant to the prime Rules of Christianity, and the pure Principles of Charity, and so to receive its ap∣probation or correction. Now if this little Mite be by any accepted and imbraced, if any by it be in∣structed and profited, the Author hath his End, and is well recompenced and satisfied.
Brethren, This is the first of my looking towards the Press, I hope I shall have an Allowance from you more or less, where I have failed in Method or Cir∣cumstance, I hope you will blot it out of your Re∣membrance.
