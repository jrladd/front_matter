My Lord,
I Was never so proud, as to think I could write any thing that might abide the test of your judicious eye; what I now send, appeales to your Can∣dor, intreating you to lay aside the per∣son

of a Iudge, for that of a Friend. It is at best but a Pamph∣let, whether you con∣sider its bulke, or worth. The result of a few pensive houres spent in recollecting what the memory had registred from publike observance, or private reading, in a Theme so sadly co∣pious as this is. If it be not impertinent to tell you what hin∣ted to this trifle, it

was this; Having had opportunity to looke abroad into the world, I tooke some notice of the Contra∣stos of the Italian Princes; I remark'd the Spaniards griping Portugal; his grounds for the challenge of that Kingdome, & his way of manag∣ing those grounds; I lookt upon his me∣thod of propagating Christianity in the West: (where one

saies the Indian is bound to be religi∣ous and poore upon pain of death.) More∣over, I observed with what Artifice the Pope moderated in the European quar∣rels, and with what devices he twisted the Gopsll, and the Advantage of the Chaire togehir; and in all the struglings and disputes, that have of late years be∣falne this corner of

the: World, I found hat although the pletence was, fiue and spirituall, yet the ultimate end, and sedpe, was gold, and greatnesse, and se∣cular glory.
But (my Lord) to come nearer, when I saw Kingdomes tot∣tering, one Nation beeding against ano∣ther, yea, one piece of a Nation justling the other, and split into so many parties, and

petty enmities: and each of these quoting Bible to palliate his mad, and exorbitant opinions; I sigh'd, and it grieved mee to see popular easinesse, and well-meaning abus'd by Ambiti∣ous self-seeking men; for there is a Genera∣tion that is born to bee the plague, and disquiet, and scourge of the Age it lives in; that gladly sacrifice the publike peace to

private interest; and when they see all fi∣red, with joy warme their hands at those unhappy flames, which themselves kindle, tuning their merry Harps; when others are weeping over a kingdomes fu∣nerall.
But above all, it pierced my heart to see the Clergy in such an high degree accessory to the civill distempers, and con∣tentions

that have every where shak'd the Foundations of Church and State; so that (as a Catholike noted) there hath been no floud of mi∣sery, but did spring from, or at least was much swel'd by their Holy-water. I search∣ed Evangelicall Re∣cords, and there was nothing but milde and soft Do∣ctrines, I inquired in∣to the breathings of

the Spirit, and they were pacificatory; I wondered from what Precedents and Scrip∣ture incouragements these men deduc'd their practises; and at last was forced to conclude, that they were only pretended Chaplaines to the Prince of Peace; Those Torches that should have been for saving Light, were degenerated into fire∣brands; Those Trum∣pets

that should have sounded retreats to popular furies, knew no other musicke but Martiall All-armes.
I have endeavoured in the sequell to re∣present to you the Arts of Ambition by giving you the pi∣cture of a person o∣ver covetous of glo∣ry, the peice is course, but yet like; drawne onely in water co∣lours, which some of greater Leisure and

Abilities may possi∣bly hereafter lay in oyle.
You know that the desires of man are vast as his thoughts, boundless as the Ocean, , A bored tub is not more insatiate. Tis pity that great∣nesse should at any time be out of the Rode of goodnesse; and I would some∣times, if I durst, with

Socrates, curse him that first separated pro∣fitable and honest▪ 
It does to me a lit∣tle relish of Paradox, that where ever I come, Machiavell is verbally curs'd and damn'd, and yet pra∣ctically imbraced and asserted; for there is no Kingdome but hath a Race of men that are ingenious at the perill of the pub∣like; so that as one said of Galba in re∣spect

of his crooked body: Ingenium Galbae malè habitat; so may I say of these in re∣gard of their crooked use; That wit could not have chosen a worse mansion, then where it is viriated, and made a Pander to wickednesse.
If you aske mee what I mean to trou∣ble the world, that is already under such a glut of Books? You may easily perceive

that I consulted not at all with advanta∣ging my name, or wooing publike e∣steeme by what I now write; I knew there was much of naked truth in it, and though it might pos∣sibly be of some cau∣tion to prevent the insinuation of pious frauds, and Religious fallacies into my na∣tive Country: If any plaine-hearted, ho∣nest man shall cast a∣way

an houre in per∣using it, he may per∣haps finde something in it resembling his owne thoughts, and not altogether strange to his owne experience. It is not the least of our mis∣fortunes, that sins and vices are cost times endear'd to us by false Titles and Comple∣ments: being cou∣zened with a speci∣ous name, though much incoherent to

the thing we ascribe it: or ele, omiing the vice which is the maine, it intimates onely the eie which is the By  As for example, we call an ambitious man , a person of notable aime and high enterprize whereas in truth, signifies, an indirect affectour of Gran∣deur: And I finde that by incautelous inter∣tainment of these

Phrases, our judg∣ments are often brib'd to misapprehensions, & we seduced to bad actions. I have endea∣voured in the ensu∣ing discourse to wipe off the paint and fu∣cu: that so things may appeare in their true complexo, un∣adulterated with the slights and subtilties of Deluders.
My Lord, That your Lordship may be one of those which

the darke Poet calls
, that the youth of your Ho∣nours may be renew∣ed to you, that your happines may be ac∣quainted with no o∣ther season but a spring, is the earnest vote
