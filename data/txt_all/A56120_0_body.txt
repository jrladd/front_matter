May it please your Lordship,
THE ensuing Discourse, being solely the Product of your Lordship's Com∣mand, seems naturally to fly to you for Pa∣tronage. I am very sensible it must meet with a great deal of that Goodness of Soul, and pious Inclination, which belongs to your Lordship, to render it acceptable: But the Deference I owe your Injunction, for having
it made publick, encourages me to hope it may occasion some good Thoughts and En∣deavours in the World: Which that it may, I heartily beg of God, and humbly subscribe my self,
