Sir,
HEre I send un∣to you the Memoires of our Deceased Friend, that you have oft∣times desired to peruse; I hope you will meet in
 them with that satisfacti∣on that you do expect; for they contain many use∣ful Observations, adorned with variety of most pleasant
ADVENTURES: They may appear very strange to such as have seen nothing but their Cradle; with them they may obtain the Credit of a well humoured Ro∣mance: But Sir, You are sufficiently acquaint∣ed with the integrity of  the AUTHOR, to cause you to put a higher value upon this Relation; and I know that you are so well informed of the Proceedings of the Afri∣can People, that you will not find in it such incre∣dible Wonders as preju∣diced persons may ima∣gine. Two or three Pas∣sages look like Miracles, but they may be confirm∣ed by several of our Na∣tion, both Merchants and  Travellers, that have seen in those parts the things related; from them any may be further in∣formed. The Author was not willing to let the world know so much of his Life, had he not been sollicited and almost for∣ced to it by the importuni∣ty of those whose Request he did not dare to deny. Death hath carried him another Voyage while he was writing this, and  forced him to leave his Work unperfect in my hands; could he but re∣turn, I doubt not but we might have another Re∣lation from him as plea∣sant as this, and no less wonderful.
This Age in which we live is apt to discre∣dit what it understands not, or sees not acted be∣fore its Eyes; but its Malice or Censures will never injure the Author;  he is safe out of the Reach of Envy: So may this his Relation be in the Pro∣tection of so powerful and kind a Patron. I am,
Sir,
