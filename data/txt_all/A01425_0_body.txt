GENTLEMEN; 
for in
your Drinke, you will
bee no lesse, I present
you with this small
Collation: If either
Wine and Sugar, Beere
and Nutmeg, a Cup of
Ale and a Toste, Tobacco, or all together, may
meete your Acceptation, I am glad I had it
for you. There is difference betweene
them; but your Palat may reconcile all. If
any thing distaste you, there is Water to
wash your hands of the whole Pamphlet.
So hoping you will accept a Pledge of my
Seruice, and haue a care of your owne
health, I begin to you.
