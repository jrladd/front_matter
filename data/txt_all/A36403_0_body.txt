Noble Sir,
YOur own high merit not onely, but that renowned Family of yours (enâˆ£vid a little not) Lord Cromvvel Earl of Essex, such a Benefactor or Pillar of Church, begets this boldness in her to salute you, though farther to be acquainted have not the honor; but so much honoring them or their memory, through whose clemency or zeal, when the Faith lay at stake, we enjoy'd the Scriptures first in the vulgar or mother tongue, which began with the Commandments and Lords Prayer, &c. She saying nothing but according to the Scriptures; whereof thus,
August, 1647.
