MAruaile you may, at the
bolde approach of these
my vnblushing lines, the
first borne of my barren
inuention, who begotten
in my anticke age, now steps into the world
to seeke some worthie Godfather: but cer∣tes
if you weigh the inducing motiues,
whose all-iust (respect) perswading orato∣rie,
tempted my triuiall muse to this pre∣sumption:
I dare before hand, seale my
selfe a pardon, and promise gracious ac∣ceptance,
to this my poore Orphant in your
bosome. I hope you shall finde him ready
to acknowledge you before the world, not

for his owne sake alone, but for mine also,
who confesse my selfe so much indebted
to your loue, as me thinkes I can neuer de∣clare
it sufficiently, till thus the world be
witnes to it.
