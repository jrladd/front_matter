MADAME
These poore productions of myne, which were bredd and brought out amidst a multitude of dayly distractions, can scarce with iustice flye to any other Patronage, then your La. and your vertuous children, whose in∣stant desires gaue them beeing, while their pietie did not so much, and so earnestly begge them, as euen force them from my
 pouertie. Howeuer, were I free from that iuste tye, there is yet another, from which I will neuer admitt dispensation, which makes these, and all that's in my power, alreadie yours and theirs; to witt the affe∣ction which I owe, and haue vowed to your seruice, that is, your aduancement in vertue. As issuing from that sourse, they cannot doubt of acceptance. What proceeds from knowen loue and respect, cannot misse to meete with it mutually in well borne hartes.
If you find them vsefull for you, I haue my designe. If they leade you to a neerer approche with IESVS and MARIE and a more liuely expression of their liues in yours, I haue my end, and you the fruite. If finally, you profit by them, I haue my reward.
What effect soeuer they may chance to haue with others, please not to let them fayle to be to you certayne testimonies, that my cheife desires for myselfe, and you
 are (as I haue often intimated to you) that we esteeme our selues to know no∣thing, here below, but Iesus-Christ, and him crucified: that is, that we putt downe for a most Catholike and Apostoli∣call truth that the life and passion of our sweete Sauiour, is the most approued; the most secure, and best Schoole of all perfe∣ction; since according to your holy Fathers excellent Sentence Summa Religionis est imitari quemcolimus, the perfection end, and accomplishment of Religion, is the Imitation of him (Iesus-Christ) whom we worshippe. In whom I shall euer be.
MADAME
