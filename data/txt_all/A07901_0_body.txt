THis Booke (right Hono¦rable) as I haue beene care full to note downe nothing in it, that myghte impeach mee, either with error or vn∣trueth, mallice or affection to any, but euen haue ordered the same, according to certeintie and knowledge: so when I had fully finished it, and doone the vt∣termost of my endeuoure therin, I con∣sidered with my selfe, I was to present

the same, to such personages of Honor, wisedome, and grauitie, as, did mallice rule me, they coulde quickly espie it, or affecting my selfe to any, they woulde soone discerne it: then would Honour reprooue me for the one, & their noble nature reprehende me in the other.
To discharge my selfe of bothe these, and purchase the fauoure wherewith your Honors are continually adorned: I directed my compasse by trueth, per∣swading my selfe, that albeit in some, Veritas odium parit: yet in your Honours, Magna est veritas et prae∣ualet.
Fewe woordes suffiseth your wise∣domes, and circumstaūce without sub∣staunce, may incurre disliking: accor∣dinge as when I presented your Ho∣nours with my booke, called the Dis∣couerie

of Campion, I promised, so now in my English Romaine life, I haue performed: thinking my selfe in as safe securitie, vnder your Honoura∣ble fauor, as Vlisses supposed himselfe vnder the buckler of Aiax.
