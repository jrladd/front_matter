VErie worshipfull and my deare Ne∣phew,
I cannot but I must summond
you, the processe beeing in matter of
Tabacco, as a witnesse to testifie the
worth thereof, and since you are char∣ged,
the custome requireth that you haue a just co∣pie
of the Libell, which I present heere vnto you,
not so much that you may depose what you
know of the vertues thereof, as that you may learne

by this discourse to continue with discretion in the
practise of this precious Plant, to the ende you may
eschew by precepts of Art the dulefull heritage of a
naturall and paternall disease, and that you may
blisse the house of your natiuitie with a long, holie
and wholesome life, and that house feele some conso∣lation
by the counsell and care of him who beeing a
bough of that old and vnfading tree, shal endeuoure
to bring foorth such fruit as may both profite and
pleasure all the branches and buddes thereof, and
you before all as the principall stocke, which
I wish may liue longer then many
long liuing Oakes, to the or∣nament
of our race and
the comfort of
