Right Reverend
(as to me, so to many moe far more precious souls in Scotland)
Fathers in CHRIST,
ALthough it may be lookt upon as somewhat superfluous, or at least a little impertinent or unusual, to prefix a Dedicatory Epistle to an Epistolary Discourse; yet there be many urgent reasons which I have, not onely to tender the testimonies of those

most cordiall respects that I owe to such (friendship and) friends, and to so many friendly (yea fatherly) obligations, as I have had (from some) of you, (which do most fre∣quently use to be the rise and ground of lines entituled Dedications:) But also to evidence (in me) the remembrance of those relations in which I stand, in reference to those, under whose over-sight I have had both my Book at Schools, and my education in Christianity; And those reasons doe call aloud to me, to give an account to you (as of all my pains and studies, so chiefly) of those ten or twelve sheets following written in this contro∣versal way: And that first, because those principles, and such like as are herein pointed at, I did first drink in from the word of Truth, explained by your Doctrine; and af∣terwards, although I was more and more con∣firmed in them, by my own search and study of them, for some three or four years after I had left the Schools, yet it was most by being under the dropping of your doctrine, and the eye of your (well-ordered) Discipline. And lastly, about three or four years agone, Pro∣vidence carrying me abroad in the world, I went from home with your countenancing re∣commendation, to prosecute the principles and

studies which I had begun under your teach∣ing; so that (as I should be) I am loath to make any thing publique to the world, which I would not willingly present to your view, and which I did fear you would not willingly own, at least for any thing that should be ma∣terially considerable in any work of mine. These and such like were some of the reasons, Reverend Sirs, which were the main motives chiefly moving me, not to publish this follow∣ing Tractat, without prefixing the (most deser∣ved) mention of the worth of your names be∣fore it; desiring thereby to give an account and testimony of this, that I have not left the Principles and Studies which I was brought up in, and did begin under your Ministry: For which end I do lay it down at your feet, as cordially as I doe direct it, freely, to the hands of those who are chiefly concerned in it. And if it be accepted by you, upon this ac∣count (as I am somewhat hopefull it shall, at least for the matter of it: The points dispu∣ted in the first two discourses about the Imma∣nent Acts of Gods Knowledge and Will, and about the Nature of Remission of Sins, be∣ing, I hope, agreeable to truth, and to your own principles; & that which is chiefly aimed at, & pressed afterwards to the end, to wit, the more

diligent study of the original words of God by Ministers, being so agreeable to your own pra∣ctise, which for several years by-gone, hath bin to be carefull not to admit any to be a Teach∣er of the word of God to others, who doth not understand it (in its original) himselfe, and therefore not to ordain any, nor to set any apart as a Minister of the Gospel, without a special tryal, as of all other his abilities and qualifi∣cations for that holy calling, so chiefly of his competency in the textual knowledge of the Hebrew Bible, and the Greek New Testament. If, I say upon on those grounds, these lines, and the matter of the missive which followeth them be not disowned by you:) Then I have ful sa∣tisfaction, as to one of the chief of my desires, ent the particular; and I shall endeavour hereafter, God willing, more and more to make out my self and my pains, for your approbati∣on, in any of my hereafter to be published un∣dertakings: Onely I do further entreat you, that ye would be pleased frequently to mind the Throne of Grace, in my behalf, that I may be assisted with grace and strength from thence, not onely to grow up and to continue stedfast in your Orthodox Principles of Truth, but also (which I desire to groan and mourn under as that which is mainly wanting, viz.) to be a

follower of you, as ye are of Christ, in Christian Mortification of spirit, and in the wayes of piety and holiness. Thus, hoping that you wil be mindful of this great request, I rest, beseeching also the same gracious throne, for, no less then, Al-sufficiency it selfe to be made out to all of you, and to all the faithfull Ministers of Christ, suitably to all your, and their most weighty employments, and great difficulties, in these last, worst, and most dan∣gerous dayes; that so his grace may be alwaies sufficient for you, to bear you wrestling tho∣rough, and prevailing over all the difficult and perplexed emergencies, which possibly you can rencounter with, in discharging all, or any part of your duties, and in taking heed to your selves, and to the flock of God, over which your Lord and Master hath made you Over∣seers, until you run your whole race with pati∣ence, and finish all your course with joy, and afterwards receive the Crown of Righte∣ousness laid up for you, and for all those who through Faith are kept (persevering to the end) by the power of God to salvation; Ac∣cording to the prayers of him, who counts it a special priviledge, if he shall be owned subscri∣bing himself, Worthy Sirs,
