PIthy & pleasaunt was that inuētion of our
auncient English poet Ieffray Chaucer, in his
booke intituled (the parliament of Birdes)
wherein hee describeth the straunge and
sweete harmonie amonge the fowles of all
kindes, no one refusing to vtter such melodie
as nature in her course affoorded. The consi∣deration
whereof (right worshipfull) enbold∣neth
me to shew my simple skill in these poore
Canzonets. Although many excellent and
famous musicions haue sette foorth in Impression many and excellent
workes, yet as the sillie sparrow presumeth to chirpe in presence of the
melodious nightingall, so bluntly and boldly as a poore member among
the musicall sort, I make bold to intrude these sillie works as the first
fruits of my labor, crauing your gentle acceptaunce, whome I chose
for their patrone, both for your worthines & excellency in iudgemēt,
your manifold courtesies and louing kindnes, at all times, which binde
me in dutie to loue you: To shewe the effects thereof, I know no waie
but this simple meane proceeding (ex abundantia Cordis) And to
auoide tediousnes, wishing you all peace of mind, worldly prosperitie &
euerlasting felicitie: I take my leaue.
