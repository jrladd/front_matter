SIR,
YOur candid Interpretati∣ons
of these conceits se∣verally,
hath animated
mee to a gleaning them up toge∣ther;
and betrai'd you to a Dedi∣cation,
they say, Quae prosunt sin∣gula,
multa juvant. Nor is it un∣usuall,
for men of my condition,
in this nature, to repend the good
nature of their munificent friends



However, did my starres pro∣mise
mee any other requite, This
trifling barke (ballanced with
scarce any thing but sand and
stones) should to the fortune of
the doubtfull waves without a
Palinure: in hope, either the shores
would protect the shallow, or
the deep drown it, out of sight,
and time, out of minde. I con∣fesse
I can look upon it, no other∣wise
then a degree of impudence,
to obtrude that upon your patro∣nage
which I my selfe have scarce
confidence to owne: Neverthe∣lesse,
deigne it your accept, since,
though you finde in it (probably)
nothing good, you may yet assure



your self of the good will, and
good intents of him, that resolves
to leave nothing unattempted,
might any wayes render him
Sir,
