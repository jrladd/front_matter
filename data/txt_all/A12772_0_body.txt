SIr, to gra∣tulate your safe return frō Ireland, I had no∣thing so rea¦die, nor thought any thing so meete, as these sweete conceited Sonets, the deede of that welde seruing gentle∣man, maister Edmond Spen∣ser: whose name sufficiently

warranting the worthiness of the work: I do more con∣fidently presume to publish it in his absence, vnder your name to whom (in my poore opinion) the patronage ther¦of, doth in some respectes properly appertaine. For, besides your iudgement and delighte in learned poesie: This gentle Muse for her former perfection long wish¦ed for in Englande, nowe at the length crossing the Seas in your happy companye, (though to your selfe vn∣knowne) seemeth to make choyse of you, as meetest to

giue her deserued counte∣naunce, after her retourne: entertaine her, then, (Right worshipfull) in sorte best be∣seeming your gentle minde, and her merite, and take in worth my good will herein, who seeke no more, but to shew my selfe yours in all dutifull af∣fection.
