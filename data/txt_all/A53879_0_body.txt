THese Verses were an Epicedium of the Muses
of Oxford, made to adorn the Herse of your
Noble Father, who Dy'd so Gloriously at Lans∣down,
in Defence of his Prince and Country. It is
Apparent what a Publique loss his Death was, that
one of the first Universities of Europe should think
fit to Lament it; A Respect, it may be, never done
before to any but to the Royal Family. But as there

are few Persons (my Lord) so Deserving to be Ce∣lebrated
as your Father; so are there few Families,
which have had that Military Glory in them. Not
to go back so far as your great Ancestor Hamon
Dentatus Earl of Corboil, descended from the
Warlike Rollo Duke of Normandy; Nor to Men∣tion
his two Renowned Sons, Robert Fitzhamon,
and Sr Richard de Granvill, who came over with
William the Conqueror, and Ayded him at the Battle
of Hastings, to Wyn the Crown of England, and
afterward in the Conquest of Wales; there are late
Instances of other of your Progenitors who have
Illustrated your Race by their valiant Actions.
In the War with France, betwixt Henry the 8th.
and Francis the first, Sir Roger Granvil lost
his life at Sea: And his Son Sir Richard
Granvil, when he was very Young went a Volen∣tier
into Hungary to serve the Emperour Ferdi∣nand
against the Turk, and after that was with
Don John of Austria at the Battle of Lepanto, the
greatest Day that ever was at Sea since that of
Actium. At his Return home, applying himself
to the Sea, he became an Expert Captain and
Admirall, & after Several Voyages into the West-Indies,
and elsewhere, & Services done his Coun∣try,
with much Honour and Successe, he was at
last Slayn at the Azores Islands, having with one of
the Queen's Ships alone, being unhappily Sepe∣rated

from the rest of the Fleet, whereof he was
Vice-Admiral, Sustain'd a fight against the whole
Naval power of Spain; never yeilding, though
his Guns were dismounted, his men almost all
hurt or kill'd, himself Mortally Wounded, and
his Decks blown up, that there was no place left
to fight upon; so that his Enemies were Asto∣nished
at his valour, and Concern'd to save him,
as if he had been of their own Nation: but his
Wounds being too Mortall to be cured, he Expi∣red
in a Few Hours, and was Buried in the Ocean,
which had been the Theatre of his Glory.
I cannot forget another Sir Richard Granvill
your Lordships Uncle, who having done his Ap∣prentice-ship
in Arms in the Low-Countrys and
German-Wars, serv'd his late Majesty in the Nor∣thern
Expeditions, and then in the Wars of Ire∣land;
and at length coming to command one of the
Kings Armies in the West, kept that Country in
his Majesties Obedience, till the Rest of England
was lost, & the fortune of the Parliament prevail'd
every where: A severe Observer of Military Disci∣pline;
and my Lord General the Old Duke of Al∣bemarle
was wont to say, one of the best Captains
we had in all the War of England and Ireland.
As the Name and fortune of your Ancestors are
Descended to your Lordship, so is their Virtue too,
which appeared so early in you, that before you

were Seaventeen years Old, you enter'd into your
Fathers Command; and after you had serv'd the
King upon several Engagements in the Army, and
particularly in Cornwall, at the Defeat of the Earl of
Essex, you brought those Valiant Companies, in
the Head of which your Father was slain at Lans∣down,
to fight for his Majesty at the Second Battel
of Newbery, where you were like to have under∣gone
your Fathers fate, as well as Imitated his Vir∣tue,
for being Engaged in the Thickest of the
Enemies, and having receiv'd severall wounds, and
one most Dangerous One in the Head, with the
blow of a Halberd, which beat you to the Ground,
you lay for some time without Sense or Motion, 'till
a Body of the Kings Horse Charging the Enemy
a-fresh, beat them off the ground upon which you
fought, where you were found amongst the Dead,
Cover'd with Dust and Blood; and being known,
were carried into that place of the Field, where the
King & Prince of Wales (his now Present Majesty)
were, who sent you to Dennington Castle to be
treated for your Wounds. It could not My Lord
but be matter of great Contentment to you, to
have his Majesty himself a witness of the Blood
you had lost for him, and a Spectator of that Loy∣alty
and Courage, which are the Hereditary Qua∣lities
of your Family.
No sooner were the Armies drawn off from the

Field of Newbery, but you were presently Besieged
in▪ Dennington, where for some time you lay in
Extream Danger of your life, not only by those
Desperate Wounds you had got in the late Battel,
but in the hazzard you were in, of Receiving new
ones from the Enemy, the Bullets flying continu∣ally
through the Room where you lay under Cure,
'till you were Releived by the Victorious Forces
of his Majesty at the Third Battel of Newbery:
Nor have you only Serv'd the King with your
Sword in the Field, but been another way a Chief
Instrument of the Greatest good that ever came to
England, I mean the Restauration of his Majesty,
and of the Laws and Liberty of your Oppressed
Country. This my Lord was brought to pass by
your Prudent and Successfull Negotiation with my
Lord General Monck, you having a particular Com∣mission
from the King to treat with him; with
whom when you had Conserted all things for his
Majesties Return, and that without Imposing the
least Condition upon him, you Posted away to
Bruxells to give him an Account of it: In which
Journey as well as in the Rest of your Conduct
in this Affair, you exposed your self to no Ordinary
Danger, and most certainly serv'd the King your
Master more Effectually, then if you had won
more then One Battel for him.
My Lord General who seem'd to be Inspir'd in

the Carrying-on of this Great Business, was so Cir∣cumspect,
that he would not write to the King by
your Lordship, for fear you might be Searched
upon the Way, and what you carried Intercepted,
and his Great Design Discover'd before it was
Ripe, and therefore left all to your Care and Pru∣dent
Management; But at your Return, he wrote
a Letter to his Majesty, wherein he confirmed to
him under his Hand what he had Promised and A∣greed
in his Treaty with your Lordship, viz. That
he would Employ all the Power he had to set the
King upon his Throne, and that without Conditi∣ons.
This Letter was delivered to his Majesty at
Breda by your Noble Brother Mr Bernard Gran∣vill:
If ever Letter were wellcome to a Prince,
this had Reason to be so, since it contained no less
then a humane Assurance that his Majesties Tra∣vels
were at an End, and that the time was come
that Allmighty God would Restore him to his
Crowns & Kingdoms, from which his Majesty was so
long & so Unjustly kept by most Bloody Usurpers.
Your Lordship is not only happy in the Con∣science
of your own Actions, and Virtuous Ex∣amples
of those who are gone before you, but in
the most hopefull Prospect you have of your
Descendents. For my Lord Landsdown treading
in the Steps of his Brave Ancestors, hath been
already Courting Honour in the Wars of Hungary,

where he hath distinctly signalized himself in all
those great Occasions, particularly at Kornenberch,
where the Duke of Loraine Defeated Twelve
Thousand Spahyes in a rase Campagne at the
Releiving of Vienna, which was Besieged by an
Army of Two Hundred Thousand Combattants;
At the Battel of Baracan, where the King of Poland,
& his whole Army had been Certainly lost, if the
Duke of Loraine, with whom my Lord Lansdown
then was, had not come in, & turn'd the Day at the
very instant that fortune was Declaring for the Infi∣dels;
& lastly, at the taking of Gran, the Second Ci∣ty
of the Kingdom: and now he is retnrn'd Home
with Laurells, & a lasting Monument of his A∣chievements,
being Dignified with the Quality of
Count of the Empire, and Honoured to bear his
Paternal Coat of Arms upon the Roman Eagle.
But it is an Epistle (My Lord) that I am wri∣ting,
and not a History, and therefore I will Con∣clude,
humbly Intreating your Lordship to give
your Patronage to these Verses, which I Conceive
I have some Right to Dispose of, since by the fate
of Survivorship they belong to me, who am the
only man Living of All those Names you find
here; Except one▪ Right Reverend Lord, whose
Obliging consent is Obtain'd to this Edition. And
therefore I cause them to be Reprinted, and Con∣secrated
to the Immortall Memory of your most

Noble Father, as the greatest Testimony I am able
to give your Lordship of the Honour I have for
you, & your Family; Desiring further your Lord∣ships
Pardon for Presuming to Reprint and Bind
in One Volume together with the said Verses, a
Letter from his Late Majesty, the Royal Martyr,
to Sr Bevill Granvill, your said Noble Father; and
another with his said Majesties most Gracious Pa∣rent
to the County of Cornwall; with his Present
Majesties Warrant, given to your Lordship at
Brussells, for your Signal Services, (already Printed
in the History of his Majesties Restauration,) and
a particular account of his said Majesties Grace and
Favour to the Loyal Towns & Burroughs within
the Dutchy of Cornwall, upon your Lordships
Favourable Mediation for your Country-men:
Together with the relation of that Famous Sea∣fight
of your aforesaid Great Grandfather Sir
Richard Granvill, Written by the incomparable
Sir Walter Raleigh.
I am,
From the Inner-Tem∣ple,
Nov. 1. 1684.
My Lord,
