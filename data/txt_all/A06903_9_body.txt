AS a horse was at the first created for mans vse & ser∣uice, so I imagine in that creation it was intended that man should in his care and respect of the beast, after his iourney, shew both the thankfulnes of his nature, and the reward due for necessarie imployment: frō whence I gather (and those which either haue beene mounted ∣on Iades, or for want of gouernment haue had their horses faile them in their greatest needes) can iudge, how necessa∣rie a thing it is to knowe how a horse should bee ordered both in his iourneying & after the end of his labour, in which if I haue in this treatise following, giuen you such sufficient precepts as may both enable your horses, & dis∣charge you of much care and fearefulnesse, I doubt not but whatsoeuer malignitie shall suggest against me, yet euerie vpright brest will both fortefie and defend me, & somuch the rather in that howsoeuer I may bee thought obscure, yet I knowe I shall not be found absurde. Farwell.
