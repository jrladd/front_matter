THE Obligations I have (most Ho∣noured) to You, each in particu∣lar, are very pressing upon me, to make Any, and the most Publick Acknowledg∣ments I am able. But indeed I can sin∣cerely profess it in his presence, who knows all Hearts, It is the abundant Knowledge I have of your Sense of, and Love to the Truths of the Gospel in your Hearts, and Converses, that hath Principally determin'd me to make a Pre∣sentation to you of so singular an Evan∣gelical
Doctrine, as the following Dis∣course aspires to set forth in a True Gos∣pel Light before You, and by You to the Churches of Christ, as a Crown of Memorial to you in the Temple of the Lord; In all constant Humblest Supplications for all Blessings, and of the Kingdom particularly, upon you, and your Honoured Relations, and with an especial Regard (Sir) to that Eminent Publick Station, God hath pleas'd to place you in; and in which, I may without any Sus∣pition of Flattery say with Solomon, The City Rejoyceth in it. I am,
Most Honoured,
