Excellent Madam,
SHould I present you with your merited praise,
What Muse should I invoke? what rapture raise?
For my minerva, tis too high a straine,
As farre surpassing both my pen and braine.
When I shall say, the Lilly doth excell
For whitenesse, or the Violet for the smell;
Or for a modest blush, the Garden Rose;
What speake I more in this then each man knowes?
Or if I shall proclaime the Turtle chast;
Or praise the ripe fruits for their pleasing taste,
The Nightingale commend for many a tune,
And say shee farre excells the Bird of Iune.
If in their grace I strive to doe my best,
What write I more, then is by all confest?
If I shall say y'are beautifull and faire,
Matchlesse, unparalleld, in all parts rare;
And to those outward should I then annex
The inward vertues, that most grace your Sex!
To name which, would exceede number, or to tell
The severall tongues, in which you so excell,
Greeke, Roman, French, Castillian, and with those,
Tuscan, Teutonick, in all which you pose
The forreigne Linguist: in the most select
Both native Ideom, and choise dalect.
Or, for all learning Morrall or Divine,
To list you a tenth Muse amongst the nine?
When to the height of all these I am growne,
I shall adde nothing to you save your owne.
Nor can my praise the least advantage win you
Since all that know you know these to be in you.
If to your honours, both of Birth and Booke,
You shall but daine an animating looke,
To' inlifen these dull papers; they shall strive,
Alternatly to make your name survive.
Acknowledging, in a submisse surrender
They had dy'd blind, not lightned by your splendor.
