GENTLEMEN,
I Now at length Present you with that Sermon which at your desire I Preached at the Second Anniversary Meeting of our Countrey-men, and which you were pleased so far to Approve as to Request the Publi∣cation of it. That I have not performed your Request so soon as might be expected, I hope you will pardon me, since I had not till this time a convenient leisure to Transcribe

my Papers for the Press. If this plain Dis∣course, now that it is publick, do any way con∣duce to promote Doing Good which is the Argument of it, I shall thank God for the Success, and You for putting me upon the Attempt.
Gentlemen,
