IT is reported of Caesar, Right Ho∣nourable Lord, that he never re∣joyced more then when he heard his valiant exploits were spoken of in simple Cottages, alledging this, that a bright Sun shines in every corner; which makes not the beames worse, but the

place better. My Lord, having seen the follow∣ing Panegyricke in Latine, a Language too high for the greatest part of our Nation to un∣derstand: and considering that it was a jewell exposed only to the view, not to the understan∣dings of all, made me presume to render it into English, that even the meanest of our Natives might be able in their hearts with joy and thankfulness to confess the greatness of their Obligations to your Excellency; by whose successefull and divinely victorious hand the yoke is broken off their necks, and their hap∣py Liberty restored, that thereby, with that great Macedonian Conquerour, there may not be so much as a Miller but both loves and prai∣ses thee.
Neither durst I offer to any other hand what is only fit to be laid on thine own Altars, least I might become presumptuously foolish, but that as the Acts sung in the ensuing Panegy∣rick were thine own, the honour of them thine own, so thou only thy selfe wert fit to be their Patron. Accept therefore, Most Noble Sir, these weake endeavours, whose only aime hath been to publish and make known thy Vertues in our uttermost Borders, and that it may ap∣peare

how evidently the hand of God hath gone along with thee in all thy Actions, and carried thee with triumphall honours through the midst of so many dangers.
May the Great God of Heaven and Earth still carry you on that you may add triumph to triumph, and be victorious on every side, till arrived at that height of earthly happiness than which no man can enjoy more, you may at last be crowned with eternall felicity; which is the humble desire, and hearty Prayer of
Jan. 30. 1652.My Lord,
