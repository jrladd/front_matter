Right Honourable,
AS a Man, or Christian, out of pure love to Mankind, I chuse
rather to cast my self at Your Lordships Feet, and come under Your greatest
Censure for this high Pre∣sumption, than to omit so necessary a Duty and
Discovery as the substance of this discourse Imports; Therefore dare not
conceale the least inconvenience that may befall the Publique, but take bolness
to present my thoughts that Your non-apprehending the Prejudices hindring
Im∣provement, nor clearely your own Capassities to remove them, and may be want
of oportunity to consult about these lesser things (though very great in
themselves (the practise whereof throughly promoted, might make the greater
more easie) compared with our weighty and pre∣sent affairs, may in some measure
be an accidentall cause that Improvements of our Lands go on no better,
al∣though materially the cause is in our own sloth, Preju∣dice and ill
Husbandry. And though I dare not present this rude Treatise unto Your Honors,
to crave so high Patro∣nage, yet I shall adventure these many most humble
Re∣presentations of some Prejudices to Improvements that remain founded by a
Law; And of some other Obstacles, as firmly rooted by Corruption, that without
your Ho∣nors Power, and Wisdoms help therein; the Improve∣ments 
here tendred will be in great measure hindred.
To the removall whereof, if Your Honors shall see cause to give
incouragement, either by an Addition of such Lawes as shall appear unto you
wanting, or Repealing such as hinder, I shall not question but mens spirits
will be raised to such Experimenting of the principles of Inge∣nuity, as that
wee may see this Common-wealth soon rai∣sed to her utmost fruitfullness and
greatest glory.
The particulars here are too many here to discourse at large; I
shall therefore take boldness to present some few with some brief reasons to
evince the same; and they are very great discouragements to the Ingenuous and
Active Prosecution of the Improvements of the Nation.
The first Prejudice is, That if a Tenant be at never so great
paines or cost for the improvement of his Land, he doth thereby but occasion a
greater Rack upon himself, or else invests his Land-Lord into his cost and
labour gra∣tis, or at best lies at his Land-Lords mercy for requitall;
which occasions a neglect of all good Husbandry; to his own, the Land, the
Land-Lord, and the Common-wealths suffering. Now this I humbly conceive may be
removed, if there were a Law Inacted, by which every Land-Lord should be
obliged, either to give him reasonable allow∣ance for his clear Improvement, or
else suffer him or his to enjoy it so much longer as till he hath had a
proportio∣nable requitall: As in Flanders and else where, in hiring
Leases upon Improvement, if the Farmer Improve it to such a Rate above the
present value, the Land-Lord gives either so many years purchase for it, or
allowes him a part of it, or confirms more time; of which the Tenant being
secured, he would Act Ingenuity with violence as upon his own, and draw forth
the Earth to yeeld her utmost fruitfullness, which once being wrought unto
perfection, will easily be maintained and kept up at the height of 
fruitfullness, which will be the Common-wealths great advantage: Some Tenants
have Advanced Land from Twenty pounds to Forty pounds per an, and
depending upon the Land-Lords favour have been wip'd of all; and many Farmers
by this uncertainty have been impoverished and left under great disgrace, which
might as well have been advanced.
The second Prejudice is against that great Improve∣ment by
floating Lands, which exposeth the Improver to sute of Law for Turning a
Watercourse, by Millers or o∣thers, which are minded to molest the Improvement,
al∣though the Improvement be ten fold greaer than the Prejudice can be, and the
Advantage be far more publique than the others pretended loss can be, yet few
dare ad∣venture upon the work, for fear of being sued or molested.
Many great Improvements have been, and are to this day hindred and
ly dead because the Miller cannot be com∣pounded with at any rate; some I know,
whose Improve∣ments might be Ten-fold and more, the Millers Preju∣dice little,
if any at all, because your exact husbands so clear all their boggy, low parts,
and some time by their large draines break through many springs and issuing
wa∣ters, that they carry a better stream unto the Miller than he had before,
and his Improvement shall be able to sup∣ply a great part of the Country with
Hay and Grass, where was before but little, and may be the Millars mill may be
worth five or six pound per an. few worth ten, that usually stand upon
these waters, and let him be damnified what e∣ver he can, it is in no
proportion to the Common wealths loss to such an Improvement.
The third Prejudice is, where all mens Land lie inter∣mixed in
Common Fields or Meddowes; The Ingenuous are disabled to the Improving theirs,
because others will not, neither sometimes can the Improvement be made up∣on 
 any, unless upon all joyntly, or else upon an unsup∣potable Charge
or Burthen. As also the not cutting straight such watercourses, of such brookes
and gutters that are exceeding crooked, which some that would cannot, be∣cause
of others interests that will not, abundance of the best land in this Nation is
hereby lost, and wonderfull Im∣provements hindered, the waters raised, the
lands flou∣ded, sheep rotted, and cattell spoyled, all by this neglect.
The remedies to all the three aforesaid Prejudices, to re∣solve
the greatest advantage to the Common-wealth, and then command them either unto
a loving Conjunction in the Exchange and Improvement, or else disabling any one
to hinder another that is desirous of it, giving such recompence for any
dammage he shall make, as shall be ad∣judged reasonable by indifferent men, or
competent Judges.
A Fourth is Unlimited Commons, or Commoning without stint, upon
any Heath, Moor, Forrest, or other Common; This is a great Prejudice to many
poor men, both Cottiers and Land-Holders, who have not of their own to stock
their Commons, and so lose all, that have least need, and for whom those
Commons were chiefly in∣tended: And also a great hindrance to all; for being
with∣out that, every man laies on at random, and as many as they can get, and
so Overstock the same, that ordinarily they pine and starve their Goods
therein; and once in four or five yeares you shall observe such a Rot of Sheep,
that all that the Oppressor hath gained by eating out his poor Neighbours all
the other years, is swept away in one, and so, little advantage redoundeth to
any: So that many thousand Acres of Land are as it were useless, which were all
men limited according to their Proportion of Land or Dwellings to which the
Common is due, the poor that could not stock theirs, might set them, and reap
some be∣nefit  by them: And were they easily stinted, their
Com∣mons might be as good as their own Severals to every man that hath an
interest.
A Fifth Prejudice is, A Law wanting to compell all men to kill
their Wonts or Moales; the good Husband doth, and the slothfull man neglects
it, and thereby raiseth such a Magazine or Nursery, that they cannot be
destroy∣ed, but as fast as one destroies them, the other nurseth a fresh spply
to fill the Country: the Prejudice is greater than can be reported.
The sixt Prejudice is the not compelling men to plant Wood where
they do cut down, then to set again a treble proportion or more to what they do
destroy, especially now so much of the gallant Wood of the Nation is expo∣sed
to sale: We forget that it is a mighty pillar in the up∣holding this poor
Island, and how honorable a custom it is in other Nations, that look what
Timber they cut down, they must plant five or ten times as much in stead
thereof: And that all men might be compelled to plow their coar∣ser, old mossy,
rushy, bankie pasture Lands, being now fittest for it and will be bettered by
it, and suffers for want of it, and the Country needs it, and none prejudiced:
and for the best land every man left to his own liberty.
A Seventh Prejudice is the want of a through searching of the
Bowels of the Earth, a business more fit to be under∣taken by the Honourable
Representation of the whole Common-wealth, than by any particular man; Whence
are all our Mines of Lead, Tinne, Iron, Coales, and Silver Mines in
Wales, were they not once hid, and as uncertain as we are now certain
of them? and what should hinder but that in many places else the like may be
discovered? as suppose Coal in Northampton, Buckingham, and Oxf.
Sh. what a great benefit to those Countries would it be? Nay, if some
sorts of Stone could bee but found out in some o∣ther  parts, what
might it arise unto? Nay, say that either Marl, Chalk, or Lime, or some other
fat Earth could be found in some other parts where they are wanting, how much
would it inrich those parts? And who can say but Sil∣ver may as well be found
in other places as in Wales or o∣ther parts? I am sure that no man
knowes but he that hath searched it, and the hundred thousand part of this
Nation hath never yet been tryed.
The Eighth Prejudice may be the many Watermills, which destroy
abundance of gallant Land, by pounding up the water to that height, even to the
very top of the ground, and above the naturall height, that it lyeth swel∣ling,
and soaking, and spewing, that it runneth very much land to a Bogg, or to mire,
or else to Flagg and Rush, or Mareblab, which otherwise was as gallant land
naturally as could be, I am confident many a thousand a year are thus
destroyed, some mills worth above 10 or 12. pound per an. destroy
lands worth 20. 30. or 40. per. an. I know it of my own knowledge, I
had some few yeares since a Mill Dam in my land which destroyed one half of a
gal∣lant meaddow, meanes was used that it was removed, and that very land is
returned to his perfect pureness again.
I prescribe not the utter destruction of all, of some I do, and
others to have their water brought to a lower gage, and where they are wanting,
Wind-mills erected, as in all the Fen Country are no other, or else
incouragement given to some that I am confident are able to discover a
com∣pleat way for grinding all sorts of Corn by the strength of horse and man
as feasible as malt is. I am able to give some assistance my self to this work,
but shall far prefer others thereto, A Gentleman that hath waded so deeply
therein as hath discovered publiquely his modell at Lambeth de∣serveth
great incouragement.
And the last though not the least is the raign of many  abominable Lusts, as Sloth and Idleness, with their Daugh∣ters,
Drunkenness, Gaming, Licentious Liberty. Were not the greatest and best, and
all men made to be usefull to the body? why continue many men as members cut
off from it, as if they were made to consume it, are neither usefull in their
bodies, minds, or purses to the common good? how comes City and Country to be
filled with Drones and Rogues, our highwaies with hackers, and all places with
sloth and wickedness? I say no more but pray some quickning Act to the
execution of our Lawes against these worse than heathenish Abhominations.
All which, with many more great annnoyances and An∣nusances
(though some may think every man will be ready to remove, but we being under
such a drowsie Age, that though each particular shall be advantaged as well as
the whole body, yet it will not be indeavored as far as I am a∣ble to see into
mens minds or practices) are no way possibly removeable, but by Your Honours
either compelling them by acting Ingenuity themselves, or else so incouraging
o∣thers that are desirons thereof, that None may Prejudice Improvements, by
denying any liberty for carrying on the Work, receiving reasonable satisfaction
for the Dammage. To which if your Honours please to add but one thing more, to
give your best incouragements to all ingenious honest-hearts, some such there
are that have more within them than they can express, and many such you need,
and the Common-wealth more, whom while you are carefull to countenance, from
Hucksters and Impostors, God will either keep you or inable you to discover,
but if any one can make A clear discovery of any new Invention for the advance
of Lands, Trade or Merchandize, If your Honours please to confirm it to him for
a season, to reinburse him∣self a little, it being unconceivable what some
Ingenuous men run themselves out herein, I cannot see the least Pre∣judice 
 to any, but a great incouragement to all, nor can I have the least
glance homeward, though plain dealing be a jewell, I finding my poor plain
principles will never reach the honour of an intire discovery, if I can either
draw any thing to life out of the deep judgements or opinion of the more
learned, and have out any thing to a profitable ex∣periment from my own
practice, and hereby gain oppor∣tunity to cast it as a Freewill Offering into
the Common Wealths Treasury, as the best and all I have to give, is my utmost
Emulation. All which humble Proposals, though Unbeseeming me to present, yet a
hope will not be thought Unworthy the grave and serious Consideration of Your
Honours Wisedome, as being so much conducing to Publique Welfare, in which you
are all ingaged; to whom in this your Publique Welfare, in which you are all
ingaged; to whom in this your publique relation, I have said so much as I must
humbly beg your Honours pardon, and shall say no more because in the succeeding
Epistles your particular advantages will be cleared, and in the discourse at
large your selves discovered to be as much discovered to be as much concerned
and as capeable (in the common-wealths advantage) of as great if not greater
Improvement upon all your own particular Estates as any, which I leave before
you untill the fittest season for your Lordships Consideration and actings, as
may seem to you most conducing to the good of all Concernments. The All-wise
God guid you in your great Affaires, and make you gloriously Instrumentall to
the prosperity of the Na∣tions; These are and shall be the uncessant and
Earnest de∣sires of
