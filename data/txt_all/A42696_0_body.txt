THE Design of this plain Discourse, was to
minister a word of Counsel (and if the
Lord would bless it) of Comfort to you, un∣der
that awful and afflicting Providence,
that hath of late befallen you, which tho' very surpriz∣ing,
yet is it common to good and bad: And as it was
principally delivered on your account, so at your request
I have Transcribed the Copy, and put it into your hand
to be disposed of at your pleasure. The Publishing of it
was far from my Thoughts, when I preached it, and
is altogether averse to my Inclination, tho' to grati∣fie
you (whose desire I could not well with-stand) I
gave my self the trouble of writing it over. You have,
my Friends, no cause to give too much vent unto your
Sorrow, for upon very good grounds you have reason
to hope, that he whom you love, is with Him that loves
him better than you, and is safely arriv'd at the Ha∣ven
of Rest, that you are desirous at last to come unto.
What tho' his Race was short, his Rest is the longer:
and if he be gone a little before you, you follow after;
and if you are prepared, as I doubt not he was, you
will meet together in an unspeakable, unconceivable, far
better State and Place, then was to be injoyed, or can,
in this Vail of Tears. He is wholly set free from all
those Evils that you are still exposed unto, and is warm
in that bosom wherein you hope to be lodged for ever.
My love to him (for the Relation I stood in) was very
great from his Childhood, for I do not remember that
I did ever see any thing in him, but what did deserve
it: his Nature was very lively, and his Deportment
very obliging, that drew Respect unto him from Neigh∣bours
as well as Relations, that had knowledge of him.
And since his departure out of his Native Country, you
have had such a full Account, from good hands, of his

pious and gracious Behaviour, that should command
your silence under this sharp Providence. And, methinks
should not make it difficult for you to determine, whe∣ther
you have greater cause of mourning, in parting
from such a Child, than of rejoycing that you had so
good and hopeful a one, How many, alas! poor Pa∣rents,
that beget, and bring forth Children for the De∣stroyer;
when you had one for the Saviour, whom he
sought, and now doth, and will for ever enjoy. It be∣comes
you not therefore to mourn, as those that have
no hope: That the Lord, who hath done it, would san∣ctifie
this Stroak, and by the manifestations of his love
to your Souls, sweeten this bitter Cup, and fully satisfie
you with his Will, is and shall be the Prayer of
