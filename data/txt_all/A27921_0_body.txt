May it please Your Honour,
THE presumption of this Dedication
was first taken from that Religious
and Honourable Character, which
Your Piety and Moderation have made fa∣mous,
and celebrated among Godly Men of
divers Perswasions; from whence I did con∣clude,
That the shelter of Your Honour's Pa∣tronage
would not only be a sufficient Prote∣ction
for this well-designed Work, from what∣ever
reflections may happen to be cast against
it; but would also introduce the much more
general acceptance of it to multitudes of well-disposed
people.
And now, Sir, that Your Condescension
hath been so great, in stooping to peruse the
Preface, and inspect the Work; and after all,
That Your Wisdom hath crowned it with
Your Approbation and Countenance, and also
vouchsafed that generous Grant, of permit∣ting
Your Honourable Name to be prefixed
in the Front of it; the Eyes of those who
are truly vertuous, will have a regard an∣swerable
thereunto, and they will be animated

thereby to pursue the footsteps of a Precedent
so highly Noble, and universally Renowned.
Sir, Complements are things beneath the
dignity and gravity of the Subject, or Your
self: But Duty and Gratitude call upon me
to acknowledge, That by how much I am a
Stranger to Your Honour, by so much the
more infinitely, do these immense Favours ren∣der
me beyond expression,
