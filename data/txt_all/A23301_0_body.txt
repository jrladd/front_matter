Lady,
THe Authour
of this Essay
made you his
Patern, which
(being a Posthume) begs
you the Patronesse: let
its infancy pleade its ex∣cuse,
if it deliver in bro∣ken
words but halfe your
worth  and if you please
to take it into your pro∣tection,
it may hereafter

come forth more know∣ing
of your vertues; some
incredulous people it is
likely to meet with, who
will deride it, as Apocry∣pha;
their sinne is their
punishment; they have
not seene you: and whilst
through their malice they
condemne the Authour;
by the truth of your ver∣tues,
hee becomes a mar∣tyr:
the Title of this Ma∣nuell
is generall, the ex∣cellency
of Womans
creation, the intended
ayme of the Author was
particular, your praise:

that he might satisfie the
doubtfull; your perfecti∣ons
(though they are ad∣mirable)
are not miracu∣lous,
which if they were,
your glory would be les∣sened,
because they were
not so fully your owne:
and those of your Sexe,
could not be so justly ac∣cused
of enclining to the
vices of the times, if it
were not a declining from
their naturall puritie:
your beginnings being
equall, makes their in∣fancy
proportioned with
your glory, but justice;

and this worke of his, and
my dedication but a duty,
whereby I am obliged to
acknowledge my selfe,
Vertuous Lady,
