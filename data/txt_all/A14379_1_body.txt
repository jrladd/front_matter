THese Lines and Layes, once, twice,De¦repetita placebunt▪ againe, o're-read,
Refresht my Soule, and rauisht haue, my Heart;
So great Content and Comfort, in Mee, bred,
I could not choose, but to your-sefe, impart:
They haue Mee chang'd, for once, & made mee Poet,
Your Muse, Nought-els, that I do know, could doe it.


I'll Say in Prose, what you doe Sing in Verse
Most Christianly; The Lord is to be praised;
And in a home-spunne Speach, I'll still reherse,
What you most sweetly, soundly, heere, haue phrased.
In this Angellike Song, a part I Loue;
And though I say't but Here, I'll Sing't Reuel cap, 19. verse 1. Aboue.
