IT is neither arrogance nor ambition that makes me thus boldly to intrude into your presence, for I know so great a Sun will quickly dazle my weak eyes, but because the former parts were honoured with your royal Fathers name, this therefore hopes to be sheltered under your Princely wing, this but concluding what they begun, and ma∣king you the happy repayrer of those Breaches, which that powerfull and restless faction of Independency made on the Regalia of En∣gland, that posterity may as well see, in this, their felicity, by you, in the ruine of that faction, as formerly they read their own misery, in the Treasonable actings thereof, against his late Majesty of ever glo∣rious memory.
I have no more but only to pray, that you may in this World be blessed with the
wisdom, and happynesse of Solomon, a peaceable, long and all glorious Reign: the age of Methuselah, wherein you may enjoy the full contents of a most happy life, and at last full of honour and dayes arrive to the perfect fruition of a more glorious Kingdom, in Gods presence, before whom is fullness of joy, and at his right hand plea∣sures for evermore.
