THe bright burning Taper of Geneva,Cal. praef. ad Reg. Gal. Est hic divini verb quasi quidam genius, ut nun quam emerga quieto & dorm ente Satana. as
warme in his Devotions, as cleare and
lightsome in his Disputes, truly obser∣veth,
that the pure doctrine of the Gospel
never appeares as it were above the water,
but Satans watchful eye is upon it, and he
casts an envious gloate at it, and hath his
Tobiases and Sanballats either to jeere or fright the sincere
Professors out of the powerfull preaching thereof. In which
regard it is, that as the Jewes in their edifying the materiall
Temple, so you in the repairing of the Spirituall,Neh. 4. 17. Wih one of his hands he wrought in the work, with the other he held a weapon, have a wea∣pon
in the one hand, and a toole in the other; and you have hi∣therto
more imployed the Sword then the Mattock or
Spade, by reason of the great opposition on all hands: and
after you shall (through Gods blessing) have laid the roofe

on this sacred building, and gratefull posterity put a garland
of glory upon your heads for it, yet still there will be use of
an arming sword, not of War, but of Justice, to cut off Super∣stition
and Idolatry on the one side, and Profanenesse and
Sacriledge on the other: Heretiques with one edge, and
Schismatiques with the other. For as in the beginning of
the Reformation, so now in the endeavoured perfection
thereof, the mortall enemie of our immortall soules sets on
work all sorts of Heretiques and Schismatiques to hinder, di∣sturbe,
and (if it were possible) destroy this excellent work.
The Heretiques he employeth to pervert the Catholique
doctrine, the Schismatiques to subvert the Apostolike disci∣pline
of the Church: the Heretiques endeavour to shake the
foundations, the Schismatiques to make breaches in the
walls: the Heretiques to rot the maine timber, the Schis∣matiques
to pull in sunder the rafters of this sacred stru∣cture.
Now of all Heretiques and Schismatiques the Anabap∣tist
in three regards ought to be most carefully looked unto,
and severely punished, if not utterly exterminated and ba∣nished
out of the Church and Kingdome.
First, In regard of their affinity with many other damna∣ble
Heretiques, both Ancient and Later; for they are allyed
unto, and may claime kindred with, 1. The Millenarians in
the first Age, proclaiming Christs Temporal Kingdome up∣on
earth for a thousand yeares, before the day of Judgment.
2. With the Marcionites in the second Age, who denyed the
substance of Christs humane body made of a woman.Gal. 4. 4. 3. The
Catharists or Novatians in the third Age, who denyed Repen∣tance
and restitution to the Church thereupon, to those that
fell in time of persecution. 4. With the Donatists in the
fourth Age, who re-baptized all those that had received
Baptisme before in the Catholique Church. Lastly, with

a rabble of Heretiques in the latter Ages, namely, the Apo∣stolici,
the Adamites, the Enthusiasts, the Psycopannychists, the
Polygamists, the Iesuits, the Arminians, and the Brownists; of
all which and their Errours, I have set downe a particular
Catalogue, Chap. 2. As it was said of Caius Caesar, In uno Cae∣sare
multi Marii; and as Cicero saith of the Familie of the Bruti,
that it had in it multorum insitam at{que} illuminatam virtutem: so
in one Anabaptist you have many Heretiques, and in this one
Sect as it were one stock, many erroneous and schismaticall
positions, and practices ingraffed, and as it were inoculated.
Secondly, in regard of their audacious attempts upon
Church and State, and their insolent acts committed in the
face of the Sun, and in the eye of the high Court of Parlia∣ment.
Whereas other depravers of the Doctrine, or distur∣bers
of the Peace of the Church, whether Papists, Socini∣ans,
or Arminians, who in the later times have braved it
and set up their top and top-gallant, yet since Argus with his
hundred eyes hath pryed into every corner of this King∣dome,
and severall roomes in the great Ship of the Church,
have bestowed themselves under the hatches, and layne close
in obscurity: these with the forwardest of the Brownists
strut in the upper deck, and discover themselves with open
face, , and upbraid the State with their merit in
hazarding their estate and persons in this present War, and
boast with swelling words of vanity that they expect some∣what
more then a toleration.See The com∣passionate Sa∣maritane, p. 75, 76. that the Parl. will stop all proceedings against them, and for the fu∣ture provide that as well particular and private congregations as publike, may have publike prote∣ction; that all Statures against the Separatists be reviewed, and repealed; that the Presse may be free for any man that writes nothing scandalous or dangerous to the State; that this Parliament prove themselves loving Fathers to all sorts of good men, bearing respect unto all, and so inviting an equall assistance and affection from all. They preach, and print, and
practise their Hereticall impieties openly; they hold their
Conventicles weekly in our chiefe Cities, and Suburbs
thereof, and there prophesie by turnes; and (that I may use

the phrase of Tertullian) aedificantur in ruinam, they build one
another in the faith of their Sect, to the ruine of their soules; they
flock in great multitudes to their Iordans, and both Sexes
enter into the River, and are dipt after their manner with a
kind of spell containing the heads of their erroneous tenets,
and their engaging themselves in their schismaticall Cove∣nants,
and (if I may so speak) combination of separation. And
as they defile our Rivers with their impure washings, and
our Pulpits with their false prophecies and phanaticall en∣thusiasmes,
so the Presses sweat and groane under the load
of their blasphemies. For they print not onely Anabaptisme,
from whence they take their name; but many other most
damnable doctrines, tending to carnall liberty, Familisme,
and a medley and hodg-podge of all Religions. Witnesse the
Book printed 1644.Pref. p.  called The Bloodie Tenet, which the Au∣thor
affirmeth he wrote in Milke; and if he did so, he hath
put much Rats bane into it, as namely, That it is the will and
command of God, that since the comming of his Sonne the Lord
Iesus, a permission of the most Paganish, Iewish, Turkish, or Anti∣christian
Consciences and Worships be granted to all men in all Na∣tions
and Countryes; That Civill States with their Officers of Iu∣stice
are not Governours or Defenders of the Spirituall and Christi∣an
state and worship; That the doctrine of Persecution in case of
Conscience (maintained by Master Calvin, Beza, Cotton, and
the Ministers of the New English Churches) is guilty of all the
blood of the soules crying for vengeance under the Altar: Wit∣nesse
a Tractate of Divorce, in which the bonds of marri∣age
are let loose to inordinate lust, and putting away wives
for many other causes besides that which our Saviour only
approveth, namely, in case of Adultery. Witnesse a Pam∣phlet
newly come forth, intituled, Mans Mortality, in which
the soule is cast into an Endymion sleep, from the houre of
death to the day of Judgement. Witnesse a bold Libell of∣fered

to hundreds, and to some at the doore of the house of
Commons, called The Vindication of the Royall Commission of
King Iesus, wherein the brazen fac'd Author blusheth not
to brand all the Reformed Churches, and the whole Chri∣stian
world at this day, which christen their children, & sign
them with the seale of the Covenant, with the odious name
of an Antichristian faction.
Thirdly, In regard of the peculiar malignity this heresie
hath to Magistracie; other heresies are stricken by Authori∣ty,
this strikes at Authority it selfe, undermineth the powers
that are ordained of God, and endeavoureth to wrest the sword
out of the Magistrates hand, to whom God hath given it for
the cutting off of all heresie, and impiety; and if this Sect
prevaile, we shall have no Monarchie in the State, nor Hie∣rarchie
in the Church, but an Anarchie in both. It grieveth
a Religious eye to see other vermine corrupting other Flo∣wers
of Paradise, as our sweet Violets, and fragrant Roses, and
fairest Lillies, and various Iulyflowers, and blushing Emmenies,
and beautifull Tulips: but most of all to see this heresie, like
a venemous serpent, lying at the root of the Crown-Imperiall,
which if it be not killed, will so poyson it, that the leaves
will fall off by degrees, and the stalke it selfe shortly wither.
We read in the Prophecie of Zacharie of two staves, the
staffe of beauty, and the staffe of bonds, which supported the
State and Church of Israel. By the staffe of beauty or comli∣nesse,
the Lawes of every Kingdome and Common-wealth
may be understood, which beare up the State, and preserve
decent order and comlinesse among men; By the staffe of
bonds the covenants and oathes whereby the members are
firmly tyed to their head, and one to another. If the staffe of
beauty be broken, there will be a down-fall of all good or∣der
and government: if the staffe of bonds be broken, all things
will be at a loose end. Me thinks I see these two staves shining

in the golden Maces borne before you; the staffe of beauty in
that borne before the House of Commons, in which the
Legislative power and the beautifull order of the severall E∣states
of this Kingdome are conspicuous; the staffe of bonds
in that which is carryed before the House of Peers, in which
the power of Iudicature, even to bonds and death, principally
resideth. Now because these heretiques alone professedly
teach the exautorating all Christian Magistrates, Bloody net, p. 2. and in ex∣presse
termes deny both the Legislative power in the Com∣mons
to propound or enact Lawes in matter of Religion,
and all coercive power in the house of Peeres, or any other,
to inflict civill punishment for the violation of them, and so
as much as in them lyeth, they endeavour to break both these
staves of the Prophet, they deserve the smartest stroak from
both.dec. 1. l. 10. irius cum ates Sam∣n galeas os{que} insig∣ armorum tratus vi∣t, multa de enti hosti∣vana magis e quam ef∣i ad even∣ disseruit: nim cri∣vulnera fa- & per pi∣ & aurata  transire anum pi∣ & cando∣tanicarum tem{que} a∣ubi res geratur, tari.
With these Heretiques I enter into Lists in the ensuing
Tractate, and without any flourish of Rhetorick at all fall
upon them with Logicall and Theologicall weapons, weild∣ed
after a Scholasticall manner; for it is most true which Pa∣pirius
Cursor sometimes spake in the head of his Troops,
advancing on in their march against the Armie of the Sam∣nites,
more glorious in shew then formidable, as consisting
of men more sumptuously then strongly armed, encoura∣ging
his souldiers after this manner: Feare not this Pageant
rather then Armie; their large feathers and imbroydered
scarfes give no wounds; their rich belts, and painted tar∣gets,
and thin gilt breast-plates will not endure the push of
the Roman pike. It is not beauty, and gorgeous apparell,
but strength, and valour, and Armour of proof makes a War∣riour.
And therefore that brave Commander of the Tro∣jans,
Hector, deservedly checkt his brother Paris, a Paragon
of beauty, and an excellent Carpet Knight, in the flower of his
age,er. Il. for undertaking a single combat with Menclaus, saying,

,
,
Pickt phrases and witty conceits and ornaments of Rheto∣rick
doe well in Panegyricks, & Paraeneticks, but they are of
little or no use in Polemicks, in which thus Ennius informs
us, Vi geritur res: Spernitur orator bonus, horridu' miles amatur.
But why doe I trouble my selfe with these new upstart
Sectaries? There is a learned and reverend Assembly of
Divines attending on you, who will take care nequid Eccle∣sia
detrimenti capiat. Who prest me for this service? My An∣swer
hereunto is as ready as true, That though I were not
pressed, yet I was challenged to it. And if I had declined
this Combat, as others did, the Adversary would have
growne most insolent,Theod. hist. l. Gast. de Ana l. 1. Quoties  ve publice, s privatim con∣grederemur cu Anabaptistis, semper vict abibat verit quae a nobis stat. and all the City and Borough rung
of their vaunting brags, and confidence in their cause, and
our diffidence in ours; therefore I gave them a meeting at
the time and place appointed. And though I were but one,
and they many, yet they were not able to withstand
, the irresistible and all-conquering force
of truth: neither did they after that send any more challen∣ges.
And I had then pursued the combat with my pen, had
not the more necessary functions of my Pastorall chargeSee Romarue
hindered me. But now being discharged against my will,Solin. pol. his c. 9. Fons est i Sardin. qui contra venenum S lifugae (est eni animantis ej morsus morti∣fer) a summo omnium opific in remedium conditus est; u oritur malum ibi quo{que} inve∣nitur prompt remedium.
of preaching at my Cures, and having lately published an
Answer to a Popish Challenge: I could not think of any
fitter employment for the present, then to perfect the notes
taken long since in that Disputation, and to supply whatso∣ever
might seeme lacking to the fuller confutation of those
erroneous tenets, & to commend both to the publike view,
that the Antidote might be there ready, where the infection first
brake out. As Solinus writeth, that in Sardinia where there is
a venemous Serpent called Solifuga, (whose biting is pre∣sent
death) there is also at hand a Fountaine, in which they

who wash themselves after they are bit, are presently cured.
This venemous Serpent (verè Solifuga) flying from, and
shunning the light of Gods Word, is the Anabaptist, who
in these later times first shewed his shining head, and spec∣kled
skin, and thrust out his sting neere the place of my resi∣dence,
for more then twenty yeeres: And if these Disputa∣tions
and Writings of mine may prove like the Waters of
the Fountaine in Sardinia,etron. Arbit. nde datum est ulnus, contigit de salus. soveraigne against the sting and
teeth of this Serpent, I shall account my paines well spent;
and whilst I endeavour to free others from spirituall thral∣dome,
forget the tediousnesse of my corporall, and possesse
my soule in patience, till God shall send deliverance; to whose
gracious direction, and powerfull protection, I commend
you, beseeching God to crowne your sincere intentions, and
religious endeavours, for the Reformation of Church and
State, with such successe, that this your meeting may be like
to that in the 25. yeare of Edw. 3. which is known to poste∣rity
by the name of Benedictum Parliamentum, the blessed
Parliament.
