I Have great cause to feare the liquor I have expressed from these unripe grapes may disrelish in your expe∣rienced, and judicious Pa∣lates: and that what I now

designe as an humble testi∣mony of my duty and obser∣vance, I may my selfe ere long condemn to the flames as a libell and indignity to the relation I am ho∣noured with from you. Yet having thus adventured the usage of the World (which certainly is grown in all respects more pee∣vish, & ill-natur'd of late then formerly) I knew not how to scruple my appro∣ach to your gates, whither

(if to any place) proscri∣bed Candor and Humanity has retired. Were I to limne out the exact pour∣traicture of that charity, Christian prudence, and moderation (to which I chiefely purpos'd to do ho∣mage in these sheetes) I should place no other Ar∣chetype before my eyes but your selves. But I shall pray for an Apelles for that piece: in the meāe time may it please you to illust∣rate

these obscure shad∣dowes with your grati∣ous radiation, and accep∣tance.
