My Lord,
THis Sermon being delivered by a son of mine, whom it hath pleased God to call to his speci∣all service in the Ministery of his Gospel, upon the anniversary day of the Inaugura∣tion of our gracious Soveraigne, the 27 of March last. In the passing of it, not only thorough my eares (for I may well be deemed partiall) but of di∣verse others of the then Auditors (who surely could not be partiall) it found such approbation, as wee did not thinke fit it should be confined within those narrow limits of a small Parish but that it should bee communicated to others, by this diffusive way of silent speaking by these dumb Characters, to the

eyes, eares and hearts of all who please. My Lord, I have long studied to find out some way or other, wherely I might returne some acknowledgement of those many undeserved favours, which I have re∣ceived from your Lordship, and having the free ten∣der of this Sermon, from the Deliverer of it as a pledge of his duty to mee: I could not but think fit (I having nothing else so worthy) to present it to your Lordship, the rather; First because the subject of it is touching Rulers and Magistrates, a∣mongst which your Lordship sits in none of the lowest rankes. Secondly, because it teacheth the duty of the people to their Rulers and Magistrates, and how they ought to deport themselves towards them in words and actions. A thing very necessary in this licenci∣ous age of ours where every man conceives hee may not only thinke what hee list, but utter what he thinkes, be it of the greatest or highest: I shall humbly desire your Lordship, to set apart one va∣cant houre for the perusall of it, and consider it comes from a higher Spirit than from the spirit of the Speaker; Wherefore it cannot bee altogether unworthy Your Lordships sparing so much time for contemplation of it: We shall wish it may prove acceptable to Your Lord∣ship; And for us, both the Author and the Pre∣senter,

Wee shall ever (as exceedingly obliged) rest desirous to take hold of all occasions to offer to Your Lord∣ship all fit testimonies of our duties and respects and shall ever remaine
