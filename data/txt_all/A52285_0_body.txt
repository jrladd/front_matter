SIR!
THIS Sermon Preached upon a Publick Occasion, and now Printed for a Publick End; the Law of Custom requires it should be Presented to a Publick Person; and to whom more sit than your self, our Worthy Representative in Parliament: But besides, their is a more particular reason which obliges this Dedi∣cation; your Candid Expressing your self to some Friends, who waited on you before the last Election, in such a manner as have secured your Interest in the Affections of the Best and most Sober Inhabitants in Hampshire: So that a New Election will be but a repeated Confirma∣tion of the same Person: Your Generous Presenting the Dissenting Ministers Association to his Majesty, has bound me in Gratitude, to return you Publick Thanks.
SIR!
It has been very delightful to me, to hear of your Exemplary briety and great Civility, above the common rate of the Gentle∣en of our Age. Now may that God who has made you Great, ke you Good, and incline your heart to the Purity of Religion,
which as it is the Greatest Comfort of a Christian, so it will be the best Ornament of a Gentleman. You have a great Coppy to write after, if you survey the Life of your Renowned Grandfather, whose memory is precious in the hearts of the best among us. As you enjoy his Estate, my hearty prayer is, that you may Inherit his Vertues, which to our comfort you have given no small hopes of: Go on Worthy Sir, to do Worthily in Ephrata, that you may be for ever Famous in our Bethlehem: So begging Pardon for my Presumption, I shall trouble you no further, but Subscribe my self,
