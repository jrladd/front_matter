WHat Comets are, the Wisest Heads admire,
Though what they mean, is all the most enquire.
Both sorts to satisfie was ne're my thought:
Alas! they're not agreed yet what to doubt.
But though to salve all Wonder I despair,
'Tis no presumption to allay the fear.


You, Noble Pair, in whom concentred meet,
Beauty and Vertue, Grace, and All that's sweet,
Pardon if this intitul'd to such jars:
Comets take Patronage of Brightest Stars.
