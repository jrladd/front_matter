My Honoured Friends,
TO justify my Publication of this Sermon, which the Reader will easily perceive was not intended by me for the Press, I must acquaint the World, that it is done in perfect Obedience to your Commands. Your great Loyalty and Zeal for Their Majesties Government, gave you too good an Opinion of it when you heard it from the Pulpit; and if it should

not answer your Expectations from the Press, yet I hope you will own it as a Te∣stimony of my due Submission to your Iudg∣ments, and of those just Respects, which your many and repeated Favours daily chal∣lenge from,
Gentlemen,
