MY LORD,
I Should not have presum'd to have prefix'd so Great a Name to so mean a Work, had I not been sufficiently assur'd that Candour and Good∣ness, are not the least of those Excellent Qualities, which have acquir'd You the Love and Esteem of all that have the Honour to know You. 'Tis this Considera∣tion, joyn'd with the Experience of Your Lordship's former Fa∣vours, which rais'd me to the Con∣fidence of expressing my Obliga∣tions to Your Honour, by dedica∣ting

not so much the following Sheets, as My Self, the Compiler of them, to Your Lordship's Ser∣vice. But I am afraid both the Piece and its Author, are so in∣considerable in themselves, and so unworthy of Your Lordship's Eye & Regard; that my Offering will seem to most Men, to have more of Presumption than Gratitude in it. And truly, MY LORD, I am so sensible of the Objection, That tho' I would willingly shroud my self under Your Lordship's Pa∣tronage, yet I dare not in the least implore it for the Essay it¦self; which hath so many faults, that some may be apt to cen∣sure the whole Undertaking as an unpardonable One: and I am unwilling that Your Lordship's Name shoud be used, in the de∣fence of a Trifle, which it might

have been perhaps more for the Author's Credit to have conceal'd than publish'd.
And now having said thus much in Excuse of my self, I must con∣fess I was never under a greater Temptation, to say something, ac∣cording to the Modern Custome of Dedications, in Praise of Your LP; but that I fear I should need ano∣ther kind of Apology, should I at∣tempt to give a Character of Your Personal Worth and Excellency; or enlarge upon those Eminent Ser∣vices, with which You have oblig'd both Your Prince and Country, in the most hazardous Tryals of Your Loyalty & Affection to each, when either the rights of the Crown, or the Liberties of the People call'd for your Assistance: Your Lordship being still one of the First, that was content to have these Your Obliga∣tions

cancell'd and forgotten; and who never suffer'd either the Ca∣resses of the Court, or the Applause of the Populace, to tempt You from Your Duty, or Your Post: But having adorn'd the Great Office You under∣took, and nobly defended the Re∣ligion You profess'd, (by steering be∣twixt the hot blasts of Zeal, & the colder calms of Indifferency) You generously declin'd to make Your Services appear mercenary, or by raising Your Self to a higher Sta∣tion, give the World occasion to su∣spect that You courted Virtue and Religion for any other than their own Rewards: Which that Your Lordship may happily enjoy is the Constant and Affectionate Wish of
YOUR LORDSHIP'S
Most Oblig'd, Faithful and Humble Servant,
