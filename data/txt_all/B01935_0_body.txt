MADAM,
JT is now high time that your Prince∣ly Eyes should no longer contract redness from teares but a brave fire from Revenge, That you should deal with your Passion as the generous ORMOND with that infamous fire-brand of the world that Canker to the Royall Stock and Branches CROMWELL, suffer it to possesse some Out∣skirts and frontiers of your Soule, that by the expansion of his incroachments its Spirits may be wasted and layd open for Ruine; And your victorious Reason (contracting all its forces)
 sweep all such treacherous Invaders from the face of the world, and leave nothing of it in Nature but a Memory, which may make it stik to all Posterity.
ocia's Coales are of no further use for dspaie, all they can bee serviceable in, is to create a flame to which the barbarous Re∣bels must be fuell, and the fire may bee a Purifier to the Region of Soveraignty, clee∣ring all the Ayre from those two greatest Plagues to Order and Mankind Rebellion and Rigicide. God has now ripened them for the Sickle of Revenge; it is highly oppor∣tune to shake them from the trees of Autho∣rity and Rapine whereon they hang, and since hanging is naturall for such Gomorrah Ap∣ples, Tyburne in England is the properest place in the world for such fruits, if their rottennesse bee not too violent Eye-sores to the view, and of too great a Stench to the Nose∣thrils of Passengers.

The 30.th of January shall bee recko∣ned amongst those Ominous dayes which are fatall to the repose and safetie of Nati∣ons, which though it antecede heere that in ENGLAND by tenne dayes, yet my passi∣on of Revenge, and my engagement to fol∣low that Standard of your Heroick Sonne, which must carry with it a Restitution of the World to Lawes, Libertie, Religion, Conscience, and all Obligations divine and Humane, hath made mee make use of the Kalender in FRANCE, and present an An∣niversary upon the most horrid Murther the Sunne ever view'd; not to stirre up your un-exampled Pietie to Teares, but to awake your owne Royall and all other Loyall Bo∣somes to revenge; which, when it shall breake foorth in its just magnitude and demensions, the Rebells will confesse, that Our long Silence is like a Calme, whose
 unsuspected tranquillity is followed by nothing lesse dangerous then totally subverting Earth∣quakes, or universally consuming Thun∣ders.
MADAME. The Persian Princes had a constant Monitor to remember them of Greeke affronts and injuries, may this Anniversary bee your Remembrancer that all Europe is engaged to your assistance; that you have a fate more no∣ble impending then to live in exile, or un re∣venged; that you have a Sonne, who, by his fiery persecutions and Vertues, will, one day, make good in his examples, all which is ever related of the most excellent Princes; That there is a Nation which with infinite groanes implores its restitution to Monarchy, its re∣demption from Rebellion, in which it is fa∣tally captivated and engulphed, and (which, MADAME, deserves a Lower ranke amongst those more Majestique concernments) let it
 bee a speaking testimony to the World, that J am (in Spight of all Revolutions occasioned by Thieves, Rebells, and Regicids.)
