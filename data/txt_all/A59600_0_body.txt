Madam,
AMongst the many Ex∣cellencies where∣with it hath pleased the Father of Lights to adorn and illustrate you, this is not
 the least of your Vertues, that you do not love to be told of them: And for my part, such is the Reverend re∣gard that I bear to your sweet modesty, that I fear to write what I suspect your Honour would blush to read. In my judgement I do esteem your Ho∣nour to be a Person fit to be addrest to for your Patro∣nage of a Discourse of this nature, and that I in so do∣ing am not far from the same circumstances wherein the great Doctor of the Gentiles stood toward King Agrippa, when he accounted him∣self happy that he had to
 do with so competent a Judge. And in ingenuous gratitude I account my self tantum non bound publickly to beg your perusal and owning of this latter Dis∣course, whose acceptance of the former (when it was only offer'd you as a pri∣vate Present) I found so kind and affectionate. I know your Honour is not asham'd of Religion, nei∣ther name nor thing, and I hope you will neither be asham'd of, nor offended at him, who out of a sin∣cere desire to promote the happiness of mens Souls,
 hath adventur'd to explain and recommend it to the World, though he be but,
Madam,
