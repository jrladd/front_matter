FRom th' ARK of Hope, still tossed in distresse
on th' angry Deluge of disastrous plight,
My silly Doue, heer takès her Second slight,
To view (great Lord) thy World of worthiness:
Vouchsafe (rare Plant of perfect Noblenes)
Som branch of safety, whereon she may light;
Som Oliue leaf, that may presage me right
A safe escape from this wet wildernes.
So, when the Floud of my deep Cares shall fall,
And I be landed on sweet Comfort's Hill;
First, my pure thoughts to Heav'n present I shall:
Then, on thy fauours meditating still▪
My Zealous Muse shall daily striue to frame
Som fairer Tropheis to thy glorious Name.
