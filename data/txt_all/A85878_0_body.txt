Worthy Sir,
(VNto whom being gone from you I am still a Prisoner, and obliged in gratefull bands:) Suffer I pray si this escaped Bird out of your Cage (for there it was hatched and fledg'd) to returne (like a Robin in the Winter) to warme it selfe, at your house, that is, to have the Protection of your Ac∣ceptance.
I know the Proverb will bite me, and say I am an ill Bird (for defiling or 

rather publishing some undecencies of my late nest,) it is not Sir, with any intention to increase the dung, but clense the Augean Stable wherein your Herculean hands have labour'd, and daily doe, to the very great applause even of those who are not o∣therwise so well pleased with their Capti∣vity.
Nothing herein reflects upon any one personally, and not in the least thought upon your selfe; The passages are true, the mirth innocent, the Author is as hee shall al∣waies acknowledge himselfe to be Sir,
