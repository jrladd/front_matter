WHEN I throughly conferred, (right Honourable and my ve∣ry good Lady) your noble for∣wardenesse in all godly Litera∣ture, your graue and approued iudgement, with my base sim∣plicitie, and slender vnderstanding: I stoode ho∣uering a great while betwene the extremities of a double doubt, whether I were beste to sollicite your good Ladiship with the view of these thrift lesse lines or no. But when I called to mynde your Honors courteous disposition of Nature, and readye inclination to accept of the trauells of all suche as do but stande aloofe, yet beare a certaine peculiar reuerence to good letters, a freshe hope so armde or rather warmde my for∣mer frosen doubt, that all feare sette aparte, I
 rashly aduentured the publishing of this peeuish Pamphlet vnder the patronage of your Honors name: where I knowe it may haue as safe a re∣fuge, as if it were protected vnder the Target of Minerua, againste the poisoned Inuectiues & malicious reproches of all slaunderous tongs. Perhaps (Madam) your Honor wyll haue me in some suspition of Arrogancie, in as muche as I haue presumed to trouble, or rather weary your honorable eares with so vaine an argument, as these fantasticall trifles: But yet my faithfull and affectionate zeale (vnto youre good Ladi∣ship so forwardly addicted) had in due conside∣ration: my ouer boldnesse may be rather attri∣buted to my want of knowlege, than presump∣tion, in as much as your Honor is not altogi∣ther ignorant, that I neuer marched among the Muses, nor serued in the campe where Learning as Chieftaine had hir sacred residence. But had I Platoes diuine Imginations, Aristotles Philo∣sophy, Archie's Geometrie, Orpheus Mu∣sicke, or Tullies Eloquence, yet wold I not haue such a glorious opinion of my own excellency, but I could willingly, and would moste gladly
 submit my selfe, my skill, and all vnto your La∣diships approued iudgement, and fauorable pro∣tection: especially, being one, whose honorable opinion of my poore skill vnworthily, and ma∣nifolde bounties vndeserued, haue bin sundrye times of my parte well proued and tasted, to my no little credite, and very great benefite. I might haue taken sufficient occasion in these su∣perfluous Pamphlets to haue entred into a ne∣cessary Enchomiasticon of your Honors sundrye good vertues and noble qualities, if without the helpe of my barren blazoning, they were not already so notified to all the worlde, that youre Ladiships iust praises are in euery mans mouth: and besids in the attempting of it, there depēds a double daunger. Firste, leaste seeming to wade so farre into the discourse thereof, as the matter yeelds iuste scope, by this meanes I get the name and note of a Thrasonicall Clawback: The other doubt is, leaste vndertaking so diffi∣culte a taske, and not able to discharge it accor∣ding to the dignitie and worthinesse thereof, I wrappe my selfe in such an intricate Labyrinth, that I shall hardely winde my selfe out without
 some spotte, or blemishe to my credite. And therefore I will yeelde thaccomplishing of that enterprise to other, whose Muse ca better wade through so daungerous a forde, than mine.
Meane space in moste deuout maner I am to request your Ladiships fauourable acceptation of these treatises, and to esteeme of them, as a perfect testimony of the good heart and duti∣full zeale of
