RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
IF Books were to be estee∣med
for their Bulke, and
not for their Worth:
I would not presume to Dedi∣cate

so little a Book as this is, to
so great a Lord as You are. But
since it is their Goodnesse, and not
their Bignesse, that makes them re∣commendable:
the Book it selfe,
I hope, shall answer for me. For in
It, your Honour shall finde a great
deale of good matter, contained in
a little roome. In It, You shall
see the Doctrine of the Church of
Rome flatly condemned; and
the Doctrine of the Reformed
Church, fully Justified: And that,
not by any passages taken out of the
broken Cisternes of the Traditi∣ons
of men; but by many expresse
Texts, and necessary Consequences
drawn out of the Pure Fountain of
the very word of God. In a word,

though it be of a contemptible Sta∣ture:
yet you shall finde It to be a
pretty tall Man of his hands; skil∣full
in his weapons; and so full of
mettle and spirit, that like a little
DAVID (comeing in the name
of the Lord, and being armed with
his Word) he foyles and utterly
overthrowes that Great GOLIAH
of Gath, I meane the Church of
Rome.
And now, most Illustrious Lord,
the thing that hath encouraged me
to make choice of Your Honour,
and seeke after Your Patronage,
is, that my Author (of Noble ex∣traction
himselfe) Dedicated this
Book of his to a Great and Re∣ligious
Princesse of my Nation,

Daughter to that Renowned
Prince, the late Duke of RO∣HAN:
by which example, I thought
my selfe obliged not to disparage it
in England.
But the most prevalent Motive,
and, as I may say, the very Load∣stone
that hath attracted me there∣unto,
is, chiefly, those transcendent
vertues which I see shine so bright∣ly
in Your Honor, and wherewith
God hath adorned Your Soule
as with a garment: I meane that
Fervent love You have to the
Truth: That Ardent Affection
You shew to the Sincerity of Re∣ligion:
and that Inbred and
Holy Hatred You beare, not one∣ly
to all Popery and Supersti∣tion:

but also to the least thing
that might conduce thereunto.
And for the Confirmation of
this testimony of mine: Give me
leave, Most Noble Lord, to
boast that I am very strong; and
may, with as much right as any
man, use in this the common En∣glish
Proverbe, that saith, I come
with a Witnesse: since I bring
no lesse with mee than the
Voyce of the whole King∣dome.
For indeed, Right Honora∣ble,
though I have been in most
places of England, and have
carefully and diligently observed
the bent and affections of the Peo∣ple:
I never yet met with any man

that dissented from that opinion.
What hopes then should not I
have that Your Honor will ac∣cept
of this poore Labour of mine,
and afford It Your Protection,
since It sutes so wel with Your dis∣position;
and that You shall see
in It the Truth of that Religion
which You Professe; and the Fal∣shood
of that Religion which
You Detest.
Vouchsafe therefore Most Illu∣strious
Lord, to receive It with a
gracious eye, and to afford It Your
Countenance. I know that for
Your Honors sake, it will be
welcome to this Nation, when
they see Your Honorable Name
in the front of It. And I make

no question but after they have
read It, they will love it also for
its owne sake. If in these times
(wherein many looke back towards
Babylon again, and Popery hath
been here so bold as to thinke
her selfe at home) the Publicke re∣ceive
any fruit thereby, they shall
be obliged unto Your Honor for
it: but I more especially, who
will acknowledge my selfe bound
so long as I live, to be and re∣maine,
