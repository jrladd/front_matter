Right Honourable,
WHen I had the Happiness to be first known to your Lordship, during your Late Tyrannical and tedious Imprisonment at Windsor Castle (for which I still acknowledge my self obliged to your own Condescention, inviting me thereunto) I remember your Lordship was pleased to ac∣quaint me, that some Books of mine formerly published, had been part of the entertainment of your private hours, du∣ring the vacancy which that barbarous Persecution gave you from Publick Business. And the remembrance hereof em∣boldneth me to presume, that your Lordships Library will af∣ford this Little Piece also a place among its Fellows: Nor
 am I altogether out of hope, that it may have the like favour of approbation at your Lordships hands, from the experience then given me of the value which your Lordship then assured me you put upon them: Especially, when I consider, that the subject matter of it is Loyalty; for which your Lordship then suffered so deeply under the heavy hands of the Late bloudy Tyrant and Usurper: and for which I have been for seve∣ral years persecuted by the Murderers of our Late Sovereign of Glorious Memory, for endeavouring to obstruct them in the quiet possession of his vacant Seat, by both refusing to subscribe, and also bearing publick Testimony from the Pul∣pit against the Subscription of that accursed Engagement, imposed by them in order to a post-justification of that horrid Fact, the Extirpation of the Royal Posterity, and the Set∣tlement of themselves in their Rights, by colour of a pub∣lick and National Consent.
And I assure you (my Lord) that the Concience here∣of (together with that little Contribution which (in my low capacity) I have (through Gods Goodness) lived to give towards the Restauration and Settlement of his present Ma∣jesty, my most Gracious Soveraign, and Royal Master, (whom the Divine Protection long preserve) is not the least of my Comforts, nor (I hope) shall be to my dying Day. Upon the comfortable experience whereof (as also upon the conviction of those Doctrines, which in this, and my for∣mer Parallel, I have published to the world) I am resolved as long as I live (through Gods Grace) to seek the Peace and Welfare, and Support (to my capacity) the Crown and Dignity of my most rightful Soveraign, and bid a per∣fect defiance to all Persons and Principles whatsoever, that are given to change.
Now the Lord grant that the guilt of the Late Horrid Murder upon the Lords Anointed, may be so wiped off from the Score of these Nations, that we be never visited with
 those very evils, or worse, (for a just punishment thereof) to prevent which, the Contrivers and Executors of it, took so ir∣regular and unlawful a course. I mean, that the violent re∣vengefulness of some Spirits among us, may not re-produce such woful Tragedies, as God hath mercifully delivered us from once and again, within a few years last past, and perpe∣tually honour his just and rightful Successor, our present So∣veraign, with the most Noble and Glorious Title, of the Allayer of our mutual heats and animosities, the Modera∣tor of all our Differences, and the Reconciler of us each to other (even whether we will or no) by the Interposition of his Royal Authority. Let  be his per∣petual Motto, and the inviolable Observation of all his Acts of Pardon and Oblivion, be his Memorial and Honourable Remembrance to all Generations; and may your Lordships Counsels be perpetually assistant to Him (as I doubt not but they will) in all things of that Tendency; which will not only preserve your Name in that Repute which you have hither∣to maintained amongst all pious and sober persons, but render you a Councellor in whom there will be safety to the Person and Throne of his Sacred Majesty, and make good the Chara∣cter, which amongst other your Honourers, have been given of your Lordships Wisdom and Temper, by
Right Honourable,
