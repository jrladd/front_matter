Deare Neece,
IT is on all hands confest, that some things here may be thought as unsuitable to my Years, as your Education (not yet removed from a vertuous Mo∣ther,) By those are not acquain∣ted with the externall Impulse which makes their Publication to the world unavoidably Ne∣cessary, in reference to the pre∣venting a false Impression; no lesse Then that more Inward of naturall affection to you (not knowing but this may be my

last opportunity) to do right to Gratitude. So as if any expres∣sion here should be of force to make you blush, it would by augmenting your Beauty prove a Good Effect of a cause at the worst but respectively Evil; and only in reference to such a Su∣perlative goodness as you are in∣dowed withall: whose appre∣hension of Ill results rather from Admonition and Prudence, then Experience or Consent. Faults al∣ready become in many ripe for punishment, being not yet arri∣ved within the Circle of your thoughts. Wherefore (since the worst can be found in these pa-Pers, if candidly taken, does not

come short of some of the best are daily made vendible,) I desire you to vail your Judge∣ment with Charity; known in remoter Relations so extensive as to cover more Levity, then I hope is extant here: Orif blee∣red by Interest, I should mi∣stake no lesse in its own desert, then the acceptance of the VVorld, it can not disparage your Name long; which no doubt will sodainly be changed, and you left free, either to own or reject what is here presented: unlesse God for the punish∣ment of the present Age will make men unwilling, because unworthy to approch so much

virtue, and other excellencies as are naturall in you; the repetition of which would not onely call up the bloud into your face, but confound mine, were I guilty of half the infidelity in your Sex that ignorance, folly and malice hath voted to my share: who am so zealous through the mediation of your perfections in the vin∣dication of women, that I am not onely ready to become a Con∣vert, but a Martyr, rather then appeare any thing but, 
Dear Neece,
