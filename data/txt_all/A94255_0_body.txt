Madam,
THis strange maid, being now the second time, drest up in her English Habit, cometh to kiss your hand. She hopes you will admit her to your Closet, and speak a

good word for her to your worthy Friends, and endear her to Them also. Her Company will be the more delightfull, because her discourse is very rational, and much tending to the perfecti∣on of that Sexe, where∣of you, excellent Lady, by your Noble Vir∣tues are so great an Or∣nament and Example.
