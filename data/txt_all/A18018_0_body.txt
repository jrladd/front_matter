THe Iewes beeing captiued in Babilō (Right worship∣full Sir) were not a little sorrow∣full, not onely for their miserable thraldome of body: but also for this, that they could not then, and there exercise themselues in the right ser∣uice of the true God, as they might sometimes freely haue done in the Citie of Ierusalem and land of Iudah:
 therefore, when the Babilonians (in their merrie moode) required them to sing one of the Songs of Zion: they in their heauinesse answered them: How shall we sing the Lords Song in a strange land? howsoeuer it was delightsome to the Babilonians, now triumphing ouer those Iewes, to heare them to sing one of the Songs of Zion: it was (doubtlesse) no Iesse wofull to the Iewes, to sing the Lords Song, then and there among such as scorned and cōtemned both them and their holy religion: then it was sometimes loathsome vnto those Iewes, to heare the holy Pro∣phets to sing and modulate such di∣uine Canticles and Songs at home in their owne land. But thus did the Lord deale with thē in his vpright iudgements, that for as much as they neither loued, nor delighted in, but altogither loathed and disdai∣ned, both the Lords messengers and
 their holy Songs & diuine Sermōs, euen then, when they had a time of grace and peace, with fit opportuni∣tie to heare & sing the same to their owne solace and the glorie of their God: and therein resembled them that would not daunce vnto them that piped, and proued like the bar∣ren and vngratefull vineyard: there∣fore a time & place ouertooke thē, where in (they being miserably cap∣tiued) were thralls vnto such, as did (in the like sort) both disdaine them, and deride those holy Songs and so∣laces in the which their soules shuld take the greatest delight and cōmo∣dity: neither had they the like peace and opportunitie to vse and exercise that which they had both neglected and grossely abused in the due time: wherein as their vnthankfulnesse was deciphered towards the Lord God after his manifold benefites on them bestowed: so his iudgements
 laid on them for the same, were like∣wise expressed and made knowne. The Lords Prophets foreseeing such things to ensue on that vnthāk¦full people, did not omit, nor for∣beare, to foreshew them therof, and the same by many Arguments to ap∣proue, wishing and admonishing them to accept gratefully, and to vse reuerently the graces of Gods spirit offered them, the which would bee for their good; and that the neglect thereof, would surely bring vpon them intollerable troubles & woes both of body and mind: the which gentle admonition, when the Pro∣phets perceiued, how lightly the Iewes did regard & loosely obserue, it grieued them not a little, howsoe∣uer those hard hearted Iewes could not bee moued to lament for them∣selues, vntill their dayes of sorrowes came. Hereat Ieremy wept bitterly for them, whereof also hee made a
 Booke of mournfull Songs, entituled, s Lamentations. And this Isayah the Pro∣het perceiuing (being now moued by e spirit of God in the anguish of his fflicted mind) did not onely reprooue  threaten thē in his ordinarie Sermōs, ght wofull that they so little regarded heir owne health▪ but also composed a ertaine mournfull Song, which he en∣tuled, The Song of his Beloued, touching is Vineyard. In the which he depainted nd set forth before them, their horrible ngratitude towards their God, whom hey had moued to sigh and complaine hereof, and prognosticated their future iseries. And surely, as these Sōgs were omposed and sung vnto them for testi∣onies against them, and to admonish hem: so also were they both written & reserued in the holy Register for ex∣mples vnto vs, on whom the ends of he world are come; to teach, instruct, nd warne vs, not onely to accept, em∣race, and highly regard the Songs of he Lord and his diuine religion in this
 our owne land and time: but also, to yeeld vnto him the sweete and timely fruites of the same: lest (peraduenture) being iustly depriued both of this bene∣fit, & of al meete opportunities towards the recouery of this lost treasure, we shall not only desire to see one day of the Sonne of man, and shall not see it; thirst after that which we neglected & not haue it; and long for that which we loathed and not obtaine it: but also full longsomly lament the losse of our hap∣pinesse, and the sense of our miserable condition with those wretched Iewes.
All these things (Right worshipfull Sir) when I had deepely waighed, and wel cōpared both this our time, & the people and condition of the same, with that state & conditiō of the Iewes (being yet at home in their ownland, then whē the Prophet Isayah was moued to sing this heauy Song) I was also moued in that my meditation, o renew & modu∣late the same, though thus simply, yet (as I presume) in right concord & har∣mony,
 for the solace, instruction, & ad∣onitiō of my brethren & countrymē, d to publish it vnder this Title, The ong of the Beloued, &c. And this being us composed and modulated, I haue ought it good to dedicate & cōmend hiefly to your Worship, therby to ex∣resse my willingnes, not only to bene∣t others (though not with siluer and old, yet with such as I haue) but also y desire to vtter some sparkle of my hankful mind towards your W. whose nciēt good wil, bonnty & right friend∣y courtesies extended towards me & ine, as I gladly acknowledge & keep n grateful memory▪ so would I with all y hart indeuor to requite to my pow∣r▪ Let it please your W. therfore to take his poore present, & to esteeme y• same ccording to my good meaning: but hiefly after the goodnes of the thing it elf, being (indeed) the Lords Song, and herfore worthy to be so entitled: & the which being weyed in equal ballāce, is ightly preferred aboue siluer & gold: nd is no lesse comfortable to them that
 are sorie for the affliction of Ioseph, an loue the Lord Iesus: and therefore  nothing doubt, but that as your Wor∣ship hath vttered your louing affection to the Lord and his truth, by hearing of his word preached, by reading of the Scriptures, by perusing the godly la¦bours of the best learned, and by th friendly entertaining and defence of hi Ministers, with other Christian ver¦tues: so ye will gladly accept, embrace and defend the truth of this excellen Solace of the glory of God, the comfor of the Saints, and the right good seruic of her royal Maiestie, in that high func¦tion wherein ye are now placed. An thus I commend your Worship, wit my good Lady, to the Lord God, who euer blesse you and your familie, an giue you all prosperitie in Christ Iesu
