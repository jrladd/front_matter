Worthy SIR,
THe noted Case of Ʋsury is both Theologicall and Politicall: the evill sometimes seene and felt there∣in, being an enemy both to God, rebelling against his Lawes; and to the Common-wealth, oppressing it feeble members; Hence we see both Divines and States-men in Battell-array, and joyning their Forces to subdue that their Adversary in common: and as that Assassinate layes so about him, as to fight al∣wayes against God and man together, so to prevent his marching for∣ward, those his Assaylaents, to doe better Execution on him, doe on both sides at once fall in, and breake up his plundering Quarters. The Di∣vine acteth the States-mans part sometimes besides his owne, in rip∣ping open the close packt mischiefe he doth to the Publicke-weale, and labouring its Redresse. The State-man at other times playes the Di∣vine so well as the Lawyer, anatomizing the engendring wombe of his sinfulnesse against God, and directing to the Remedie thereof; In thus doing they have greatly advanced each others designe, and yet neither hath obtained his full desire: wherefore as for my stepping in to helpe them both, their examples may be my warrant; so if I acheive not mine enterprise, their successe shall be my comfort. I have therefore be∣gun to publish mine endeavours in this way. Some old doting Mo∣mus, or young one-eyed Zoilus will be quarrelling thereat, and be∣daube
 mee with some foule aspersion or other (for never were there two Monsters (so they ought to seeme unto Christians) so much Perso∣nated as in this present ago) wherefore to excuse my boldnesse (which by the Envious will be made a crime) Plutarch shall pleade,In his Pre∣cepts of policy saying, In any Government whatsoever, a good Subject ought to strive, (as it were) a Vie even with the Rulers, if they be Persons of good sort, and gracious behaviour, in diligence, care, and forecast for the benefit of the State, even in going to them, to give notice and intelli∣gence of whatsoever is meet to be done, and putting into their hands to be executed that which he hath with mature deliberation rightly re∣solved upon, thereby giving them meanes to winne honour to themselves, and that by the benefit of the Common-wealth. My addresse in parti∣lar, is Sir unto you, (whose sincerity towards God our Heavenly Fa∣ther, and fidelity towards England our Earthly Mother is so well knowne) partly, because you are a Burges in Parliament for Rie, a Towne, to which I am most indebted, for giving mee my first enter∣tainment in this world, as it did both first and last unto my deceased Parents: who when they lived, as they highly esteemed of you, so were they respected by you; But especially because of my Obligement by your manifold and unmerited kindnesse to mee; for which even an heathen would hate to be unthankefull. It is my griefe I can returne no livelier expressions of my gratefull minde, yet am I not afraid to present these, knowing your gracious disposition to be such, as, like God, you looke at the heart,. more then at the hand of the giver. Wherefore not doubting of your right hands acceptance of this small token of my good-will, (though it answer to your worth no more then it doth to mine owne de∣sire) to my prayers as in generall for an Almighty Blessing on the Great Councell, to continue its prosperous proceedings unto the perfection of that great, because so good, worke begun in Church and State, so in particular, both for your present health, whereby you may be the better enabled to serve your God and Countrey, and see your desires crowned with accomplishment, before you goe hence; and for your future hap∣pinesse crowning you with unspeakeable joyes, when you shall leave this Vale of Trouble, and enter into the holy Hill of Rest, there to rest from all your labours for evermore. I onely adde the Name of

Ashburnham. May 6. 1646.
