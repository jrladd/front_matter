MY LORD,
I HAVE observed, that Persons en∣gaged by love, have used this way to make their acknowledgmēts that when they give their labours
to the Worlds view, they present them to that hand which hath by kindenesse most obliged them; I judge this practice to arise from in∣genuity of spirit, that where men cannot pay a debt, there they wil acknowledge themselves debters. Now I beseech your Excellency to give mee leave to take up this pra∣ctice, I am not able to pay the ob∣ligements of your Lord-ships love and kindenesse to mee; nor in this doe I attempt any higher thing, then to acknowledg my selfe your Lord-ships debter for more unde∣served favours then any person I know, amongst those many thou∣sands that are fellow-debters with mee. And if your Excellency shal be pleased to own and accept of this poore acknowledgement, I shall
declare it to be the fruites of your owne wonted goodnesse, & my self not at all the lesse, but the more your debter. I am the more en∣couraged to Dedicate this to your Lord-ship from the observation that I have made of your spirit, to be willing to owne truth and hone∣sty in the lowest person & the mea∣nest dress. What I here present to your hands, I trust will bee found truths by the word and spirit of truth: but I confes unto your Lord∣ship, it is in a very mean attire, with∣out the ornament of humane lear∣ning: And I expect Worldlings should slight and scorn it upon that account: but if they appear truths, as truth is in Jesus, I am confident they wil be beautiful in your Ex∣cellencies eye. I have had much
struglings between my flesh & spi∣rit, whether to bury, or to bring forth these breathings of God upon my soule. The spirit of God hath made them very sweet to me, and my spirit judged they might be so to others, therefore was I willing to breath them forth: but then my flesh objected that the stile was low and meane, and that this subject out of my hand would administer matter of scorne from the World: and if one of a thousand did value it, yet a thousand for one would slight me and it. Til it pleased God to ca∣ry me above scorn, I could not rise to this resolutiō, to bring that forth to the World, which God by his Spirit had brought into my soule: but when I had resolved the world should have it, I was not long to
seeke in my self of a hand first to present it to, but resolved to pre∣sume upon your Excellencies excee∣ding love and goodnesse, so as to present it unto your Lordship as the acknowledgement of my reall af∣fections & abundant engagements to your Excellency.
Sir, I blesse the Lord I have no base ends in this appearing to the World; for if the reasonings of my flesh could have prevailed, this had never beene an object for Worldlings scorne. And if the Lord shal give you time to read it, I hope it wil appeare to your Ex∣cellency, and to every spiritual eye that shal looke into it, that my de∣signe is to lift up something above my selfe, (Namely God in Christ.)

And finding the same spirit to be in your bosome, I am encouraged to dedicate this following Treatise to your Lordship, and take that boldenesse as to subscribe my selfe your Excellencies very much enga∣ged, and ever faithful servant,
