SIR,
IT hath ever been a∣mongst the first of
my wishes and desires,
to render my self known,

(and if possible) accep∣table
to Your Grace, by
some special and signal
Service: But seeing
(through the malevo∣lence
of an angry, and
frowning Fortune) that
honour is denyed to me;
yet, generous Prince, do
not disdain to look upon
the effects of my ambition,
(poor and inconsiderable
as they are) with a pro∣pitious
eye. If I be pre∣sumptuously
bold, in this
testimony of my profound

respect, I hope your Grace
will impute it to no other
cause, but to your gene∣rous,
courteous, and affa∣ble
deportment to all,
which disdains not the
meanest and obscurest, as
well as the more glorious,
and resplendent objects.
I throw my first Labours,
& Rustick▪ yet Maiden-Muse
at your Graces
Feet; and I humbly im∣plore,
that both may be
shrowded under the wings
of Your Noble Patro∣nage,

where they shall
find a sufficient Protecti∣on,
against all carping
Zoylists, and ill affected
Detractors, which will be
an infinite satisfaction
and honour to
