TO thee, true picture of humanitie,
Learnings deare friend, wisdomes high fauorite,
That dost discerne twixt froathie vanitie
Of want on rimes, (bellowes of lewd delight,)


And learned straines of sacred poesie:
My Muse this shorter sonnet doth addresse,
Till for thy loue and gracefull courtesie,
She may in better Layes her zeale expresse.


For when (of better growth) she shall enroule
The praise of Worthies in records of fame;
Forgetfulnesse shall not her pen controule,
For not enregistring thy worthie name.
â–ªFor thy deserts do truly her assure,
Thou rightfully art he that Chaloner,  Hal'honneur. Hal'honneur.
