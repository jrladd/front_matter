MAY it please your Maie∣stie,
so long as breath is in
my breast, life in the hart,
and spirit in the heade, I
cannot hold the hand frō
penning of some accepta∣ble
deuice to your Maie∣stie,
not to compare (in mine own ouer wee∣ning)
with the rare Poets of our florishing age,
but rather counterfeyting to sette foorth the
workes of an extraordinarie Painter, that hath
drawne in a pleasant conceite, diuers flowers,
fruites, and famous Townes: which pleasant
conceite I haue presumed (this Newe-yeeres
day) to present to your Maiestie, in signe and
token that your gracious goodnesse towardes
me oftentimes (and cheefely now for my pen∣cyon)

shal neuer goe out of my remembrance,
with all dutifull seruices, belonging to a loyall
subiect. So vnder your princely fauour & pro∣tection,
praying for your prosperous preserua∣tion
and Royall estate, I proceede to my pur∣posed
matter.
