Most Dread Sovereign, and ever
Blessed of the Lord,
MAY it suffice to shew and say unto
Your most High and Sacred Majesty,
That the Design of Chelsey College
(which I now, in the demonstration of it, pru∣dently
and most humbly dedicate unto Your
Majesty) was first of all by Your Royal Grand-Father
King James graciously and greatly ap∣plauded,
whose most excellent Sagacity ha∣ving
understood the wisdom of God in it, gave
thereunto, with his Parliament, it's Feat and
glorious Form. Afterwards it was no less ap∣proved
off by Your Royal Father of ever bles∣sed
Memory; by Him it was abundantly
Commended, who with great zeal comman∣ded

his late Archbishop Laud to promote to
the utmost this admired Design, and speedily
to put it into all good posture and Accommo∣dation.
And therefore this Plot is of most
pretious Concernment in all sorts of due Re∣verences,
for the great and incomparable well∣fare
of the Church of Christ: For so it was in
the real and tender account of those Noble Sons
of Honour and true prudency of the first Par∣liament
of Your Royal Grand-father: which
is therefore above all recommended to Your
Gracious Majesty, whom the most High and
Holy One hath so Miraculously Preserved, so
wonderfully and blessedly Restored, to be in
many things and waies the Repairer of decayed
Persons and Places. And especially, because
the Case and Dignity of Chelsey College had a
known and very large interest in the pious af∣fections
of Your famous and Glorious Uncle,
Prince Henry, which he set his heart upon, to get
immortal Honour by his most endeared fa∣vour
and Princely respects thereunto, studying
with all his power and prudence to advance
this College to be the Pillar, yea, the standing
and living Monument of his flourishing Fame
and deserved Glory. But the Lord made and

found him fully ripe for his Celestial Throne;
that he might make Your Blessed Father (the
Mirrour of Princes) most fit to sway the Scepter
of these Kingdoms, whose Princely Affections
and Commands were full of integrity for the
Compleating of this Seat and Nurse of Lear∣ning
and Truth. Now, if Your Majesty shall be
pleased in regard of this, with the aforesaid re∣spects,
to espouse this College, and to meditate
the perfecting of it, for the most Blessed im∣ployment
thereof; oh then, how shall the Hearts
and Tongues of all Good men (whose eyes
behold You as most Happy, propense, and
Pretious) blesse Your Sacred Self, and multi∣ply
their delight and most holy Prayers in and
for You, that from the first entring upon Your
temporal, You readily Contemplate to make
this Your eternal Praise and Dignity? The ra∣ther
let Your most Admired Majesty humbly be
beseeched to set Your Kingly Countenance on
this Design of so much weight and worth,
for that the King of Kings hath in his amazing
and astonishing way of never-to-be-forgotten
Mercy, now at length, like Noah's Dove, re∣turned
You without Gall (in all gracious Cle∣mency)
with an Olive hopefull branch of

long-desired and blessed Peace into the Ark of
our most happy Church and State; where, let
the High and Lofty One ever delight in and
over Your Majesty to doe You good, with the
Richest and Choicest Blessings of this and the
next life poured out both into and upon Your
gracious Heart and Head. And the Lord grant
that You may be Crowned with the Glory of a
long, prosperous, and uninterrupted Reign over
us, That holy Truth and Peace being perfected,
You may so have the Heavenly and eternal
Kingdom begun in You,
 which is The utmost flame of the zeal of the
most holy and hearty Prayer of
