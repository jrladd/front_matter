THere rests the height of knowledge, when wee see
The Praticke part linck'd with the Theorie;
To both these, Obseruation. To contend,
Whether this Art th'ast best obseru'd, or pen'd,
Is questionable: most, thou say'st doe draw
A lawlesse drinking into rules of law.
The Souldier, Clearke, and Sea-man, from this part
Speake all in their owne termes, and drinke by Art;
Yet heer's the master piece thy Art could faine,
To shew to drinke, and drinking to abstaine.
