PVrposing (right Reuerend & Ho∣norable) to publish this little book, it came into my mind to commend the same to your honourable pro∣tection. For it seemed to me, that although all good men of al estates are bound in conscience and loue, to contend earnestly for the faith, which (as S. Iude saith) was once giuen to the Saintes: yet are there some more proper reasons, in regard of your two callings, which chal∣lenge in my iudgement, a more peculiar eye and watch vnto these causes. For being both of the same most Honourable table, of her Maiesties most graue wise and Christian Counsell, where all are set in the same charge and ioyned in the same care, namely in all prouident and

godly ouersight, to manage the great affaires, pertaining to Gods worship and glorie, and the blessed safetie of the Queenes most excellent Maiestie (whom God vouchsafe long to preserue among vs:) yet the one being a minister and Bishoppe of the gospell, and set ouer many others, for the good and faithfull teaching and practising of the christian faith in this land: And the other a professed and chiefe Iudge, for the executing of all lawes and statutes, ordeined for the maintenaunce of true religion, iustice, peace and godlines: this being a necessarie declaration of our Christian faith and religion, established by the pub∣like magistracie, and lawes of this realme, and a faithfull displaying of the iniquitie of poperie, being a mortall ene∣mie and a verie great opposite vnto the same: It could not so properly respect any other, whose ofifce and profession did so neerely and naturally offer it selfe to patronize and protect so iust a matter of this kind. Therefore I humblie craue your Honours fauour, to accept of this my tra∣uaile, and your fatherly countenaunce vppon mine ho∣nest labours. Which, although I frankly acknowledge, might haue beene more eloquently and exquisitly hand∣led, by some man of greater giftes: yet I hope, that in some measure it shalll satisfie the expectation of such honest and Christian readers, who both can and will iudge according to equitie und truth. For my purpose being, (considering the season) to shew the antiquitie and certaine truth of our faith and religion, nowe pro∣fessed in England, and the newnesse, vncertaintie and falshoode of the popish superstition: to this ende that it might bee a stay to many which wauer and seeme nowe readie to fall away: I endeuoured rather to ioyne plain∣nesse

and perspicuitie with breuitie, then by large ampli∣fication to shew great learning, and by direct arguments to make manifest an vndoubted truth to the conscience of all men, for the gayning of some vnto Christ, rather then by saying what I could to trouble the reader with abundance of matter, or hunt for that which is vayne and fruitlesse. And this verily I thought most necessarie, and the rather because diuers men in differing manner haue heretofore handled this argument, both that I might giue occasion to men to enquire after and to reade such godly writinges: and also because the present season seemeth to call for the same, when poperie beginneth to ouerspreade, and after a sort to set vp his brissels against the gospell, and men of that superstition are verie much lifted vp: that it might appeare, what a foolish, wicked, new broacht and monstrous heresie and aposta∣sie they so much contend for & so egerly labour for: be∣ing greedie of that which will slay their soules, and proud of that whereof they ought to bee ashamed. Therefore I haue made choice of such methode and reasons, as I hope thorow Gods blessing, shall effect that I purposed, and make that manifest which I desire. Whereof knowing that your Honours can iudge with wisedome, and that your Christian care tendeth to this ende, that the people by all good meanes should bee staide, in their faithfull obedience to God and our most gracious prince: I was bolde to present this booke vnto you, most humblie be∣seeching you to accepte of my bounden duetie to my Prince, countrie, and to the Church of GOD: ear∣nestlie praying GOD to bee with you alwayes with his gracious fauour and good spirite, to guide you

and prosper you in all good and godly endeuours, to his ho∣nour and glorie, to the good of prince and coun∣trie, to the increase of the Church, and to your owne soules comfort in Iesus Christ, Amen.
