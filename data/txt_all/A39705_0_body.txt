TO you, as to the onely few, I de∣dicate this Book, for there are not many so wise and happy now adayes. You neither thinking harm, nor doing any, and so have the lesse done to you, whilst those who alwaies trouble others and themselves, never want others to trouble them again, and so live wretchedly and miserably all their lives.
Let us do then in these times as I have seen the wiser sort of passengers doe in Holland ships, when the weather has been a little foul, get under hatches, and make our selves as merry as we can, whilst for those busie bodies, who will needs be talking and medling above decks, I have seen the skipper with a good ropes end sometimes, courteously intreat them to go down and not trouble them.
Mean time thou maist entertaine thy selfe with this, which I desire thou wouldst be so charitable to believe, is no part of my Study, but my Recreation, written chiefly to divert the grief and melancholy of a certain illustri∣ous personage, too much pressing & oppressing her noble minde, and that in as few dayes (almost) as 'tis divided into Jornadas, with onely the allowance of some small time for the polishing it, which I have not done so accu∣rately; but thou maist well perceive, I affect not these, difficiles nugae, or studied toyes: however, if you like it, I care not, for your dull melancholy people, who never laughed since the Kings death; and relish Iests as Horses doe Italian Sallets, and French Ra∣gouts. If they like it not, let them take Hele∣bore.
Farewell, and laugh, and be merry.
