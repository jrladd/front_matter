My Lord,
BEing about to publish the ensuing little Book, These are humbly to beg your Lordship's Patrociny, which I am emboldened to do on the following Reasons.
First, Because it had its Birth under your Lordship's Roof, while I had the Honour to be one of your Lordship's Domesticks.
And in the next place, because it is in it self improveable for promoting of Piety and Business, in both which respects your Lord∣ship hath rendred your self eminent amongst those of your Rank.
By a long and undaunted owning and pro∣fessing of the former, both in publick and private Capacities, your Lordship is no less signalized than your renowned Ancestor was at the famous Battel of Solan Mosse, where

he purchased Victory for his Country, entailed Honour upon his Family, and enrolled him∣self in the Registers of Fame as a Hero of the first Magnitude, whose Atchievement oc∣casions one of the noblest Passages that the History of the Kingdom affords.
By your Lordship's Skill and Dexterity in managing the latter, you have aggrandized your Revenues, and made them more adaequate than formerly to the Splendor of your Family.
These things being considered, it seems very natural for this Enchiridion to cast it self at your Lordship's feet and beg your Protection, which tho the subject matter thereof be but mean, and seemingly below your Lordship's Grandeur to Patronize, yet being the best way I can conceive my self able to express my Gratitude for Obligations I am under to your Lordship, I hope it will be taken in good part from him who shall always look upon it as his Honour to have been, and ambitious still to entitle himself,
My Lord,
