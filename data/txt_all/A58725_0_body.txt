MAy it Please your Lordship, the pre∣sent times being Pestered with nothing but Invective Pamphlets and Scurilous Libels, most of which are cunningly design∣ed either to invalidate the Truth of a real Plot, or to
insinuate and prove a fict∣tious one, and the Bookselle Shelves, especially their cou∣ters, being filled with no thing else but Intelligencies  Addresses, Absolom and Achit∣phels, Medals, Prologues, Ep∣logues, with innumerabl more of the like Tendency  it's not easy for a Perplex Prince to get room in thei Shops, or find Leasure i their Customers to perus unpleasing Stories. The Per∣plext Prince! say some; Away with him, and tell us of the Vi∣ctorious Prince, who having sur∣mounted all Difficulties, Tram∣ples upon all that oppose him  and like the Rising Sun, marche
in Splendor and Triumph towards the Meridian of his Glory. The Perplext Prince, says others, how can that be? since he was indewed by Heaven with a Pow∣er to remove all Persons that occasioned any displeasing or Perplexing Thoughts, and altho he might in the Exercise of this Power have been guilty of some kind of Injustice, yet the Digni∣ty of his Office would have wash∣ed away the stain, for Kings can do no wrong.
My Lord, this and its be∣ing so usual to dedicate Books of this Nature to Per∣sons of your Illustrious Cha∣racter, that we seldom find
any venture into the World without it, since Books have their Fates attend them, as well as Citie and Kingdoms, is the only Motive which hath imboldened me to make this attempt upon your Lordships goodness. Its proba∣ble you may think it strange that a Person with whom you are altogether unacquainted, and never saw in your life, should presume to obtrude a Dedication upon you; to which I shall only say, that although it be somewhat un∣usual, yet it is not altogether impracticable, I having seen others tread the same Path before me, whereby I was
the more incouraged to ad∣venture after them.
And so hoping this No∣vell will afford your Lord∣ship some agreeable Diver∣sion when your vacant hours from more weighty Affairs shall permit your perusal thereof, I account my self happy in having this occa∣sion to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
