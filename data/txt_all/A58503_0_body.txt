THE Itch of Popularity is an Epidemical Disease, and Men often are tickled with Fame of any kind, though purchac'd like that of Erostratus, viz. by throwing the Firebrand. Much such another Glory must the Author of this Pamphlet set up for. But to encourage so hardy an Undertaking, 'tis well he tells us, That the King is a Prince in whom we know no Vices, but what have been esteem'd Vertues in others, viz. his undeserved Clemency to his Ene∣mies. 'Tis a Sign indeed that he believes him merci∣ful, even to a Fault; otherwise this licentious Piece of Scrible would never have dared to expose its Face in the World, for fear of exposing that of the Author's a little indecently, and well if he scaped so. However, if Mercy be the King's Fault, 'tis none of this Pamphle∣teer's; for never was Crown'd Head treated more bar∣barously
by a Mass of the rankest Suggestions that ever past with Impunity.
'Tis true if he meant what he says, that the Royal Clemency was his only Vice, the Author's whole Outcry of Slavery would be husht, and his Argument vain. But this Author that never says one thing twice, can write Panegyricks in one Page, and Satyrs in another; and begs your leave that Prevarication, Inconsistence, Chimera's, and even Contradiction it self, may be currant Standard in his way of VVriting; otherwise the greatest Beauties of his whole Argument will be lost.
