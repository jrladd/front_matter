FRiendly, frolicke, franke, free-hearted, famous flourishing Fish∣mongers;
And braue, bold, battring, Beefe-braining Butchers,
to both your Companies in generall I wish health and happinessed
acknowledge you to be Haberdafhers for the belly, & I wish a plen∣tifull
encrease of good appetites and hungry stomackes, that euery
one in their calling may proue valiant of their teeth, whereby
you may feede merily by the profit you receiue bynimble-chop'd feeders. I haue
plainely and briefely set downe Iack a Lents good deeds and his bad, his friends
and his foes, the great need and necessitie that wee haue of his comming once
a yeere into this Kingdome, and the great pitty that hee is no better entertained
and obserued. And though it bee written in a mery stile, yet I dare presume
that mirth and truth walke together in it. In a word, reade it if you like, and
iudge it as you lift, please your selues and I am pleasde: and let I. S. hold
Iacke a Lents stirrop whilest hee alights, for of all men I haue most reason to
preferre him for a tricke hee shewed mee lately. So I rest yours euer, and his
as farre as hee dares sweare for twelue-pence.
