AS I haue taken some paines and trauell (Right Ho∣norable) to pleasure and pro∣fit manye, by the publishing such rare, straung & excellent thinges, as many could haue byn content to hide and keepe secrete: Euen so I haue byn carefull, to dedicate the same to some worthy and meete Personage, that woulde take the same thkful∣lye, peruse the same willingly, and imbrace it accor∣dingly. And though I am acquainted with som, know diuerse, and heare of many, to whome I might well and worthely present the same: yet amongst all other, I haue chosen your good Ladishippe of goodwill and zeale (pardon my rude rashnesse I beseech you) to haue the first smell of these sweete, pleasant, straung, beautifull and precious Flowers, not growing in one Garden: but in sundry Soyles, not quickly found, but long agathering, and not all of one property, but of di∣uerse quallities. Whose Affabillitie hath allurde mee: whose Curtesie hath compelde mee, and whose Fame hath inforst me, thus boldely or rather presumptuously

to offer you the same. And though at the firste it maye seeme too simple for you, yet I am certaine, that diuers thinges therin will delight you, some will also satisfy you, part therof will peasure you, sundry from harmes may shielde you, plenty of them may preserue you, and a number besides needefull for you. Beseeching your Honor not to respect the Geuer, but the Gyft: not the Man, but the Matter: not the Skill, but the Will. Whiche if you accept as willinglye, as I offerre faythfully: I shall thinke my long paynes and trauell therein fully recompenst. Thus ceasing herein any fur∣ther to trouble your Honor, do commit you to the cus∣tody of him, whose wisdome first framd vs, whose fauor dooth feede vs, whose might dooth maintaine vs, whose goodnes dooth guide vs, and whose power dooth protect vs.
