Right Honourable:
THat many haue no better ac∣quaintance
with Christ and
his Apostles, is because they
are such strangers with Mo∣ses
and Aaron: were cu∣stomes
antiquated thorowly
knowne, many difficulties in Scripture would ap∣peare

elegancies, and the places which now
(through obscuritie) dishearten the Reader,
would then become sweet inuitements to an vn∣wearied
assiduitie in perusing those sacred Ora∣cles.
If my present labours shall giue such light
to some obscure passages, that thereby Gods peo∣ple
shall be drawne on with the greater delight, to
exercise themselues in reading of Holy Writ, it
shall not repent me of my tedious trauell in these
rites and customes of Generations long since past,
which whosoeuer vndertaketh, shall finde the
way long and thornie, the path ouergrowne and
hardly discerneable, the Guides few to direct, and
those speaking in strange languages, and many apt
to disccurage him, because themselues are either
lazie and will not, or lame and cannot walke the
same way. But now (through Gods assistance)
being come to the end of my iourney, the discoue∣ries
made on the way, such as they are (and such
some are, as not obserued before) humbly craue
your Lordships protection.
From Kensington,
Feb. 21. 1624.
