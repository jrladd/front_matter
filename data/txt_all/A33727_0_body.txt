Most Worthy Sir,
IT was the Expression of Varius Gemi∣nus concerning Caesar, That whosoever durst speak to him, Ejus videatur ig∣norare, magnitudinem; he that durst not, singularem ejus nesciat humani∣tatem. Upon this Consideration, as to your self, there hath been some suspense whether I should adventure these unpoli∣shed Meditations upon your Perusall and Protection, whilst on the one hand that exemplary humility and humanity with which God hath brightned the rest of your Perfections, hath invited me to; on the other hand, the Greatness and Elevation of your State discouraged me from that Enterprize. Yet so fixed and

prevailing, at the last, do the considerations of your Nobleness, Ingenuity, and Candor prove, that here they lie at your feet; if not to challenge Approbation from you, yet at least, to pay the Devotion of the Author to your Honourable Name and Per∣son.
Had I sought the vain applause of men, I should not have communicated to the World my own imperfections, of which this Tract cannot but be a Discovery unto all: Nor yet, had I sought my own advantage, should I have suffered these Conce∣ptions to have had a Birth so late and unseasonable, as being in∣deed born out of due time; being that a more early publi∣cation of those Principles herein contained, might have been, perhaps, as effectual to prevent the losses, disappointments, and pre-occupate the credit of whispering reproaches, which I have since undergone, as the supposal and surmise thereof, have been in former years, to procure unto me h small adversity from those present Powers.
But of the thing it self, and the exhibition of it now to pub∣lick censure and view, these are the Grounds and Reasons.
Since the preaching hereof, I have, with no little sadness of spirit, observed the impetuous torrent of most unmerciful re∣proaches, pouring out it self upon many pretious servants of Ie∣sus Christ within this County, and indeed upon the whole Body of them who labour under continued travels of soul, after necessa∣ry Reformation in the house of our GOD. And according to the platform used by the Churches Enemies in the primitive A∣ges of Christianity, so also now the evil will of some persons en∣deavours to fasten upon us, the black imputations of Disaffecti∣on, and Disloyalty, and Dissatisfaction with his Majesties Su∣premacie according to the Law. Of what consequences such

Disguises by uncharitable Brethren, put upon us without our desert, may be, to the deprivation of us of our Ministerial fun∣ction, the dispossessing of us from any interest in the Royal Breast of his most Excellent Majesty, and the pre-possessing of the spirit of authority with prejudice against our humble expe∣ctations and prayers for such a settlement in the Church as may comport in point of righteousness, with that establishment which now is in our State, your own apprehensions will readily suggest unto you.
I must confess, I could hardly have believed that a Clergy of so famous a Fidelity to their Allegiance, as that of this County hath been, in the worst of times, ever since any observation was possible to them of a designed invasion upon Monarchical Inte∣rest, that have so notoriously disavowed the Titles and Tri∣umphs of Usurpation, and so deeply suffered upon that account, should indeed and in earnest be thus misunderstood by any sort of men; but that my self have so lately experienced the revi∣val of that Charge and Calumny, and been prosecuted thereup∣on, with so much unseasonable and unreasonable fervour, as must necessarily arise either from a real perswasion, or a most inordinate passion.
Sir, It hath been and is my great honour and satisfaction, that I have some considerable acquaintance with those many Orthodox, Godly, and Learned men, whom God hath set up as glorious Lights and Stars in this Northern Hemisphere: and I am bold to say, that what is in this Paper, as to the sacred Interest of our lawful present Power, is the Language, Spirit, Principle, and conscientious Iudgement of them all, and dropt from the same Spirit that ruleth in the hearts of these precious Dispensers of the Gospel. Since these fatal Circumvolutions, many Stars of the greatest magnitude have finished their course;

such as Herle, Hollinworth, Gee, and others; and for the rest of us, I can say with knowledge, as Tertullian speaks of the Christians in his time, Ad Coelum suspicientes ex∣pansis manibus precamur pro imperatoribus vitam prolixam, imperium securam, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, Senatum fidelem, populum probum, orbem qui∣etum, quaecunque hominis & Caesaris vota sunt. And if, by misconception, subordinate Authorities shall yet please to frown upon us, we shall say with him, Hoc agite, boni praesides, extorquete animam supplicantem pro impera∣tore.
Sir, Let me adde, They are not few, nor small afflictions and losses which my self, and some others, have undergone now very lately, upon the account of our objected Non-conformi∣ty, and our real desires to wait the Royal pleasure of his sacred Majesty in point of Publique Worship; as also our willingness not to anticipate or pre-occupate the publique resolutions of State, by our own private determination of that controversie in our particular practise. We are under good hopes that the De∣termination of those things (which in their present posture may so easily be made the advantage of serving the particular spleens and passions of men, against many godly, and orthodox, and peaceable in the land) will produce such a Reformation and Moderation as will issue in mutual satisfaction to all of indif∣ferent perswasions.
For my own part, although I do profess my self zealously affe∣cted to a common Uniformity, provided it be bottom'd upon such foundations as do not carry in them just cause of dissent or dis∣content: Yet I cannot but remember what Tertullian speaks, When men do adimere libertatem Religionis, & interdi∣cere optionem Divinitatis; which he there calls Elogium

non Religionis sed Irreligiositatis. I know nothing, in our Ecclesiastical Affairs, but may with comfort and consent draw in the whole Body into a common Mediocrity, if the sober ventilation of controverted things might have place, and the passion, prejudice and opportunities of divided Interests might be exploded.
Sir, You may be a blessed Instrument for this happy compo∣sure. But hower it shall be, after all such passages, I publish this, that all men may see, That it was not the confidence of con∣formity with our Principles, that was the foundation of our as∣serting of the Royal Interest; that we bottom not our Allegi∣ance upon the comporting of Authority with our Iudgements; that subjection is owned to be our duty, although we should fall under the most diametral opposition of Civil Laws and Sancti∣ons to our Principles in the things of God; that we will give submission to lawful Powers, though we should suffer the deep∣est affliction by lawful Powers, which yet we hope we shall never see. Subjection to Authority, and subjection to Iesus Christ, are not things of inconsistencie, but where Christian profession is made up more of the dross of self-interest, then of the refi∣ned Gold of the Sanctuary.
Sir, I humbly beg your Honours Pardon for this accompt; You are one of the Healers of our Breaches. You are able to take off the Disguise is put upon us, by your own knowledge of our Fidelity, when the work of the Lord had little else to support it but prayers and tears; You may stand as a Mediator in the behalf of the Church, for Peace, and Reformation, and Mo∣deration. That God that honours them that honour him, fill your heart more and more with his blessed Grace & Spirit, Your Soul with Peace, Your Family with Prosperity, Your Life with Comfort, and Your Death with Blessedness; Your Memorial

with the richest Perfumes; Your Example with a Crowd of Followers, who treading in Your steps, may know how to confe∣derate those two Sacred Interests of CAESAR and GOD.
Preston, Octob. 31. 1660.
