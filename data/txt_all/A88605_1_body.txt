Honoured Cousins,
YOu being the top-branches of those two Families from whence the deceased Authour of these Epistles had his descent, and thereby having a genuine propriety in them, it were unnaturall, by way of Dedicati∣on, to put them under the umbrage and protection of any other. He had many Testimonies of your affection whilest living, and I know you retain his memory not unsuitable: they
therefore incounter the Eye of the ingenuous Reader, under the patro∣nage and conduct of your names. Ac∣cept the tender of them as a pledge of my reall affection; and if ever Providence smile me into a capacity of dressing my power in a more be∣coming attire, I shall be ready to ap∣prove my self,
Cousin, 
Nephew,
