MADAM.

MInerva now hath lent a Birth,
In waggish Prose to give your Grace some Mirth,
In which both Iuvenall and Martiall,
Meet, and doe mixe their honey with their gall;
Here I adventured to cut a Sluce
Into the Times enormious abuse,
I point at no Man single, but Truth knowes
That horse is gall'd that winches as he goes:
Laugh then (blest Lady) and amongst the rest,
Protect this Pamphlet peeping out in jest.
