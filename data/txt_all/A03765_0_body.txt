RIght Honorable, the day now vsually solemnized to the ho∣nour of God, and memory of those blessings wherewith hee hath enriched this land in par∣ticular, and his Church in ge∣nerall, by the godly and religious government of her excellent Maiestie, was with the first cele∣brated (as we take it,) in this her most loyall and Christian Vniversitie of Oxford, notwithout the example of former times, wherein the like hath beene practised to some of her Maiesties prede∣cessors, though with different ceremonie in a different religion. Since which time it having ta∣ken progresse togither with Gods manifold bles∣sings, & enlargement both in place and ceremo∣nies, testifying the loyall harts, and duetifull lo∣ving

affection of her subiects, both to her royall person, sincere religion, and most blessed go∣vernment, as also their harty thankefulnes vnto God for them: it hath beene oppugned by the Preistes & Iesuites, the enemies of her gracious peace and happie prosperitie, whether with grea∣ter malice or ignorance I cannot well determine. VVherefore being called to the celebration of this most happy festiuity, by the nature of my office, which by your Lordships appointment (though vnworthily) I susteine: I thought it a part both of my duety to God, and loyalty to my so∣veraigne Mistres, to vndergoe the defence of the festivities of our Church, which haue their adversaries at home among vs, as of the celebra∣tion of the day of her most blessed inauguration into this kingdome, which hath found some ma∣ligners both at home and abroad, & to dedicate the same to your Honor, as my chiefest Patrone vnder her Highnes, not presuming to present her sacred Maiestie with so meane and simple a service, & so in al humility I take my leave. From Christ-church. Novem. 29. An. Dom. 1602.
