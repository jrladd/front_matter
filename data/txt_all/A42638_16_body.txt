YOur Lordship, who during the time of your extraordi∣nary Embassage in Italy, hath not only seen the best Buildings, and knoweth how to order what is best convenient, needs no advice, since your Lordships experiences in Building hath already proved it; yet my respects in the offering to your hands a little Manual, for a Testimony, that during my travels, I did not attach my Eyes onely on the generality of Ob∣jects, but did exactly consider some particulars worthy of note, (will not as I do humbly con∣ceive)



be rejected, as being con∣trary to the disposition of Per∣sons of your high Descent (that of Habsburgh) who have not been abused in their Education though it happens but too much; Neither is it natural to all those, which are born un∣der one Constellation, to have like Influences; since it hapned that when Charles the Fifth, Emperour of Germany, had his great genius elevated in Im∣perial thoughts, at the same mo∣ment he was Crowned, and a Ba∣ker his Nurses Son, born in the very same moment as Charles the Emperour was, who was obser∣ved only to be merry among his Friends, at the same instant of the said Emperours Coronation.
Wherefore reflecting upon your Noble Birth, My Lord, my confidence to offer such a little



and Inconsiderable Piece of Work, cannot be lookt upon as unseasonable: My Mark being Respect, and the Effect my Du∣ty; and so I do humbly beseech you, my Lord, to let it pass, for though to so great an experience as that of your Lordship, it should signifie nothing New; It may nevertheless, by your Lordships Favour, finde a place where things are made good, and so may prove as pleasing, as your Lordships Paradise-like-Garden at Neewnem, where an Euphrates flows: And truly, my Lord, a Ground without such Waters, is as a fair Ladies Chamber with∣out a large and clear Looking-Glasse: With more I shall not presume to abuse your Lord∣ships Patience; since as the French say, Ilfaut se lever de table

avee bon apetit. Mine shall never long more, than receiving the Honour of your Lordships Com∣mands, as being, my Lord.
