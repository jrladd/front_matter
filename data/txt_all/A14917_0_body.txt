HOwsoeuer (most bounteous Sir) this
subiect which I present, may be either
disagreeing to your disposition, or be∣ing
but a Shepheards lowly pastorall,
farre vnworthie so worthie a Patron: yet the wil∣lingness
of my soule, to shew some signe of good
will to my countrymen, enforceth mee to conse∣crate
my cheefest studies to the setting forth
of their admired vertues: which considered, I
doubt not but your Worship with curtesie, will
accept my rusticke inciuilitie, and with fauoura∣ble
Patronage, pardon my wood-borne imper∣fections.
