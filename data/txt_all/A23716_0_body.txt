My LORD,
WHEN I consider with what reluctancies I appear thus in publick; I have all reason to suspect and fear, lest this offering, which like an unwilling Sacrifice was dragg'd to the Altar, and which hath great defects too, will be far from propitiating either for its self or for the votary. But I must crave leave to add, that how averse soever I was to the publishing this rude Discourse, I make

the Dedication with all possible zeal, and ready cheerfulness. For I exspect your Lordship to be a Patron, not only to my Sermon, but to my Subject. Such a se∣parate eminence of virtue and of sweet∣ness mixt together may hope to ingra∣tiate Your Function, to a Generation of men that will not yet know their own good, but resist mercy, and are not content to be happy. And for my self, Your Lordships great goodness and ob∣ligingness hath encourag'd me, not only to hope that you will pardon all the miscarriages of what I now pre∣sent, but also to presume to shelter it and my self under your Lordships Name and Command, and to honour my self before the world by this address, and by assuming the relation of
My Lord,
