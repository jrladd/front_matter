YOur friendly disposition (right Worship∣full) giving grace to the well meaning mindes, hath edboldened me amongst others, to testifie that good will in outward shew, which my heart of long time hath secretly bore to your Worship; and now taking op∣portunity, I present to your fovourable cen∣sure, this small book, containing many quick flashes of the witty jests of old Hobson the merry Londoner, lately a Citizen of good e∣stimation. And I thinke not altogether for∣gotten of your Worship: Receive this little Treatise (I beseech you) with favour answer∣able to my good will, & as your leasure shall serve, bestow now and then a little reading thereof, which if it please you to doe, I doubt not but you will like well of the labour, and besides the honest recreation which it offord∣eth, apply what your worship maketh choise of, unto your private pleasure: and this wi∣shing your prosperity, acceptance to this my gift, and opinion of the giver: I conclude, ho∣ping that my honest wish shall not be yoid of a happy successe.
