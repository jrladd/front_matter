My LORD,
IN Obedience to your Lordship's parti∣cular Desire, as well as the publick Order from the Court to me, I here present you from the Press, what your Lordship was pleased so much to favour with your liking from the Pulpit.
The Discourse is rustick, plain, and pure∣ly practical; and was design'd, not so much to work the Head, or tickle the Fancy, as to
affect the Heart, and reform the Life to a real and universal Uprightness before God; which end if it answer, I am not at all sollicitous how it may fare in other respects.
That the Blessing of God may attend both it, and the Government of this City, is the hearty Prayer of,
