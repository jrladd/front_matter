IF the tribute of poore mens labours (Right Honourable, and my most best Lord) be the al-witnesses of our most seruiceable loues: then I hope mine which comes to kisse your hand, will protest and vowe for me, that my zeale and duty towards you and your house, hath no date but in my last breath. And al be this worke, which hath beene my many yeares experience (for the rude and defor∣med collection) may seeme too hum∣ble

for your support: yet in as much as I know both your owne excellent and well approued knowldge in the same art (and so best able to iudge either of my worth or vanitie) and your most noble affection to men of any vertue, I dare with better bold∣nesse present you with this my last sacrifice of writing, beseeching you in it to behold not only how my time is imployed, but how infinit my lon∣ging is to bee numbred onely your creature.
