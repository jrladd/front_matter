ALthough good will and perfect friendship is not to be requited nor sought with mony, yet such is the exellencie thereof, that it is often∣times requited with some ingrati∣tude, wherwith the vertue is much more beautified, as it was with the good and wise King Don Alonso of Spaine: who be∣ing giuen to vnderstand, that one vnto whome hee had done great good by preferring him to honour, besides many liberal gifts, was verie vnthankfull for the same; he answered in a milde maner, that a great good turne is neuer requited without some ingrati∣tude, euen so I may compare you in this happinesse vnto him, and in vnhappinesse my selfe vnto the o∣ther: who for much good, haue returned but ill; wherefore I am the bolder, being acquainted so wel with your good disposition, to shew my self thank∣full, being well assured that you cannot think of my seruice euill, seeing, (as I haue saide) you haue al∣waies done well, beeing deliuered vnto mee by a

Gentleman of mine acquaintaunce, a small Spanish Pamphlet, by him new done into English, intituled Lazarillo de Tormes, a Spanyard, discoursing the many hard fortunes & aduersities he susteined in the Sea, beeing transformed into a Tuni Fish; though but a toy, yet I assure you passing pleasaunt and de∣lectable; which I haue aduentured to dedicate vn∣to you: Onely crauing you will accept it as friend∣ly, as I present it willingly, and then I haue my one∣ly request. And so resting in hope of your fauoura∣ble acceptance, I commit you to the Almightie, and this poore Lazarillo, to the friendly Readers cen∣sure.
