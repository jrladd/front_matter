SIR, hauing acquainted you with
this long and laborious translation
(a subiect so learned and excellent
as in any language (I thinke) the
like is rare to be found) And fin∣ding
you willing to giue it enter∣tainement:
I discharged my affecti∣ons
frō all great men of the world,
such as looke on learning awry, and
asquint, or with a nod, or, I thanke yee, requite great studious
labours, And made choice of you, whome I knowe not onely ca∣pable
of greater matters in your selfe, but a most kind fauourer
of any paines this way imployed.
The Author in Italian calles it: Il Muto che Parla Con∣cetti
Scritturali. And the best English title I coulde giue it (in
my mind) is, The dumbe Diuine Speaker: or, dumbe Spea∣ker
of Diuinitie, because the whole course of matter is thereon
absolutely grounded, and in silent dumbnesse, deliuereth an ex∣quisite methode for the gouernment of our speaking.
Take you the honour of my paynes, as one whome entirely I af∣fect,
with you, I giue the world my labours best benefite: expecting
from you but your wonted kindnesse, And if the world giue me
good words, tis all I aske of it.
