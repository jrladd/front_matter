Honoured Sir,
THE vanity of the creature, which is by daily, and sometimes by dear experience taught us, hath this happy influence on all pious minds, to raise in them the greater reverence of, and closer adherence to the Creator; Whom to know, is highest wisdom; whom to serve, is perfect freedom: whom rightly to worship, is indispensible duty; and whom to enjoy is incompre∣hensible felicity. But where there is a Reverential awe of the Supreme Deity form'd in the heart, there will be sutable expres∣sions in the external deportment, especially in the acts of solemn de∣votion; so that the irreverence of the outer man proclaims to the world but the hidden Atheism of the inner. It hath been always matter of indignation with me, to see the Ludicra Fortunae, the Interludes of Fortune, magnified with the honour of Courtly Cere∣monies, and the Worship of that God who dispenseth all these little things as he pleaseth, vilified by those that irreverently draw nigh to him. Though I am no Hyperaspistes of uninstituted ceremo∣nies; yet God forbid that I should not declare against prophane In∣decencies. I confess I know not whose Successor I am in the province that I have undertaken, or who hath been before me in it. I am like one that is going a pilgrimage over the Alpes via aspera & consolita, in a rough and untrod path; but that sacred thred of Scripture which I have taken with me, I trust, will bring me safe to the Temple I aim at. I know I shall displease some, and seem as an idle wanderer to others; but thanks be to God, who hath instructed me to live above the unjust censures of men, and to re∣joyce in the conscience of my integrity. Sir, It is my duty and
your deserts that oblige me to offer you this little part of my Stu∣dies; and not only duty, but hope of acceptance: Hope founded not on the Merit of the Action, but on the nature of the Subject, and the known sutableneso of your apprehensions and practice: so that, by this, I dare not so much as pretend to pay one mite of my debt, but to run further on the score. Your favourable acceptance makes me more your debtor. The faults which more or less alway attend my best endeavours, I am conscious of, and confess them both to God and man. As God hath promised remittere confitenti, to forgive the Confessor, so I hope will you. Certainly I have not wilfully swerved from the Truth. If this poor Essay may interess it self in Gods blessing, and your favour and good opinion, I may expect the success that will fully answer the ends of,
Honoured Sir,
