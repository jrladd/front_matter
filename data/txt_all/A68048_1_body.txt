DEVOVT sisters in Christ, and deer
Cosins. Many yeares haue passed
since this booke was dedicated to
the aboue sayd of S. Briget, but being
twoe sundry tymes put to print in England
(whear I was then in Prison) it was both
tymes taken, though it doth not in any wise
touch either Controuersies or matters of Sta∣te.
Since which tyme hath bein erected that
your Religious howse at Bruxells, and aswell
the same as that of Louayne hath bein better
knowne vnto mee, for the entercourse of let∣ters
betwixt yow and mee (my louing Cosins
at Louayne) and by your rendition (my good
Cosin at Bruxells.) And because I owe yow
and your howses the like office as to the a∣boue
sayd (for the same causes of kinred and
Countrie) and that, as sayth the Philosopher,
Bonum quò communius eo melius, The good is
so much the better, by how much it is

more common: and (finally) for that the
subiect of the booke particularly fitteth those
of your vocation; I haue thought good to
direct it also vnto yow, the respect of the
smallnesse of the worke disswading therfrom,
wayeng lesse in the one scale of the ballance
of my consideration, then the ponderousnesse
of the sayd causes put against it in the other,
especially the Ballance being held in the hand
of that charitable affection which shall neuer
cease to worke, and doe the office which kin∣ne
and Countrie call vpon mee to performe.
And though the thing both in respect of it
self, and of so sinfull and vile a wretch from
whome it cometh, be of so small valew and
so vnworthy the printing, that I haue often
tymes hindred the same (howsoeuer the
great persuasion of others, and due affection
to the aboue named, made mee consent ther∣unto
in England) yet in tyme perceiuing it is so
acceptable in these partes to all sortes, aswell
of authoritie as of learning and perfection;
and seing it so much published throughout
France though paynfully by writing; I haue
bein more encouraged to present the same
vnto yow: though for the third part therof, it
is not thought meet to be published, as trea∣ting
of matters somewhat high for the capa∣citie
of the common sort. And if it bring
yow any spirituall profit, I beseech yow re∣compense
mee with this prayer, that I be not

like the candle which whilst it lighteneth
others consumeth it self; nor as the Con∣duict
pipe, which conuayeth water
from the fountaine to others,
not retayning any for it
self. Fare yee
well.
Your poor Brother and Cossin in
