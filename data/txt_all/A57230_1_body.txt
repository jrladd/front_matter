Most Reverend, and my very good Lord,
YOur word shall be my warrant, and your desire my duty, to
publish my Annotations upon GENESIS, together
also with my Explanations and Observations upon the
Old Testament, yet I would be loth your Lordship should beare any
share of the blame, or harsh censure that may hap to passe upon them,
Coming abroad, I know not to whom I may rather dedicate them,
then to him who is the cause that they see the light. And the inscri∣bing
of whose name, will bring lustre and credit to the Work it self,
however otherways but too weak and unworthy. To speak much in
this kinde of your selfe to your selfe, suits not so well, with that hu∣mility
and modesty which befitteth us both. And in so doing I
should but light a candle before the Sunne. Yet you will give me
leave to enjoy, and make this expression of mine own comforts,
which I have still derived from all those endearments, wherewith
you have vouchsafed to oblige and honour me, even from our young∣er
years, in our joynt Educations and first Employments, until now
that we both are ready to leave the stage of this life. My thank∣fulnesse
for your favours may haply receive some piece of emprove∣ment
hereby. And my Prayers shall still be continued, for the Pro∣longation
of your dayes, to the further good and glory of the Church
of God. This tribute you may duly and daily expect from
