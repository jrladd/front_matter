Sir,
BY your hand, as it were, I present these Collections to the Nobility and Gentry of our County, and to all other lovers of this kind of knowledge, that your name may procure the Book that esteem, which its own worth cannot give it: This priviledge I claim and use with the greater confidence, not only because I am suffici∣ently assured of your kindness and good nature, but also because indeed you put me upon the work, and therefore though I may not have done so much, or so well as you intended I should, I think you are a little obliged to countenance your own choice of the Instrument. You may remember that some very few years after your Visitation of our County, you and I being with our Friend Mr. Gervas Pigot, since deceased, at his House at Thrum∣pton, he brought us a kind of a Transcript of something, which your old Acquaintance Gilbert Boun, Serjeant at Law (my Wives Father) was designing, or beginning, towards a Description of Nottinghamshire, whereof he had been Feodary, which proved to be only Doomsday Book, and a short Note or two on every

Town, but that served to give occasion to both your importuni∣ties that I should attempt something further in it, which I proved more willing than able effectually to obey, notwithstanding your promised assistance and directions, which indeed my profession and other concerns, would not suffer me in all things exactly to fol∣low; for I could never get opportunity to go my self and stay at York, to abstract what might be useful for me from that Re∣gistry, as you ever advised me; and others it seems could not well do it for me, for I had several undertakers who all failed in the point. Yet I have made hard shift to be as little justly to blame in other things as possibly I could, so that I hope you will not disown me; and if you do not, I shall be less sollicitous what others think, for I allow no man for a Iudge who hath not done something of this nature himself. And they that have, even for your sake, I am sure will be apt to be merciful to
