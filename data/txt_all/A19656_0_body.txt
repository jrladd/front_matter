(amongeste other my labours for the sitteyngforth
of the trueth of the christian fayeth) t
ouerthrowe thys theyr bullwarcke, that these
proude philistans maye knowe that the Lord
of hosts hath not lefte his churche so estitut
of the good gyftes of the spirite, but that th
verie little ones (of his armie) are able to driu
them from al theyr holdes, and cause them to

suffer them to yelde to the trueth The spi∣rite
of the lyueinge God leade the in the
waye of trueth, that thou be not decei∣ued
by these false a dissemblinge hy∣pocrites,
which vnder the name
catholike fayeth woulde
stil mayntayne the Ro∣mishe
