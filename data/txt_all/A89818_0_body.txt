SIR,
IT is certainly but reason, that Innocence, since it so easily meets with Persecutors, should at length light on some Patrons and Assertors, that as those are the Agents & Emis∣saries of Ignorance and Barba∣rism, making it their business to ruine it, so these might, as the Guardian-Angells of re∣stored Civility and Letters, en∣deavour to vindicate it. You have here the greatest miracles

of Mankind in their severall times impeach'd of a crime, the greatest can be committed a∣gainst either divine or humane Lawes, viz. a Geotick, or su∣perstitious & Diabolical Ma∣gick, violently prosecuted by a sort of people whose design it is, by noise and number to stifle Truth, and consequently, to make the most innocent the most guilty. In so much that all the liberty they now seeme to have, is that of saying some∣thing for themselves, which is hop'd may prove so considera∣ble as not only to divert the Sentence, but knock off the fetters they have so long

groan'd under, and gain them an absolute Liberate.
To which end, Sir, you are in this Countrey the Person they make their appeale to, with a certain confidence, that as the prejudice of former Jud∣ges hath not a litle contribu∣ted to their misfortune, so your integrity may restore them to a reputation among men, great as when they were the light and ornaments of the Ages they livd in. This is a a trouble you might easily be induc'd to take upon you, did you imagine to your self no o∣ther consequences of i, than that, being look'd on as an

effect of your Goodness, you will oblige all those who can∣not but compassionate the un∣deserved sufferings of such excellent men, & may expect that acclamation and applause, which ever attends the impar∣tial execution of Justice. But when you reflect on the parti∣cular advantages accrewing to your self by this Apology, you will haply be satisfyed, there is something extraordi∣nary in the address of it to you. For, what higher motives can Posterity have to believe, that the great perfections you are master of, the general affection you command, the publick fa∣vour

shines upon you, (which when uncourted ever speaks a certain excess of merit) are not the effects of any thing more than natural, than to find you rescuing the oppressed inno∣cency of men, whom onely a transcendency of abilities made the objects of envy and detraction? What can more satisfy the world, that, when you have done things, excee∣ding common apprehensions, it proceeds from your vast knowledge and acquaintance with those Sciences whose lustre dazles ordinary capaci∣ties, than to find you relieving such as only popular ignorance

and mistake have made unfor∣tunate? And of this, what o∣ther effect can there be than that you live in the fame which they, by your Patro∣nage, are restored unto; and consequently, in the esteem and veneration of all the Sons and Lovers of Learning, but particularly, as the meanest of that number, that of,
