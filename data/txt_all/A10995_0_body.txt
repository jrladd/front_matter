RIght Honourable, Counsel and Helpe, as the Platonistes affirme, be the Two maine pillars and Suppor∣ters of euery commonwealth, of which that saying of Ecclesiastes is verified, Two are better then one; for One of these Two without the other, is but as a Reed shaken with euery blast of winde; but being both together, they are like the Two brasen pillars set vp by Salomon in the Temple at Ierusalē, of which the one was called Iachin, which is, he will establish, and the other BoaZ, that is, by in∣terpretation in strength; for Counsel and Helpe vnited doe Establish and Strengthen any state, whether it be Ecclesiastical or Ciuill; as for instance; what auaile the lawes and constitutions of Sage Counsel, made to establish the Truth, vnlesse the Lawemakers put to their helping hands to strengthen by fauour and

maintenance, such as be the Ministers & preachers of the Gospell? Certainely nothing at all: & there∣fore our Sauiour may herein be a patterne to all great personages (whom God hath ordained to be Iachin and Boaz: namely, Establishing and strengthe∣ning pillars of his Temple) of whom it is written, that when he appeared in a vision to Iohn the diuine, his two feete seemed as fierie pillars, the one standing vpon the land, and the other vpon the sea; and the spouse in the Canticles, compareth his legges to Mar∣ble pillars set vpon sockets of fine gold; whereby is inti∣mated,Aug. in Psal. 58. that Christ does walke in the middest of his Church by Counsel and Helpe, so establishing & streng∣thening it; that neither the malice of Sathā, though he be Leo aperte saeuiens, & draco occuliè insidians, one that by open & outragious crueltie shewes himselfe a Ly∣on; and by his couert and secret poysoning of religion, a very Dragon; nor the Inchantments of the world, though she like the Purple whore, makes such as he of her attendance, drunke with the Cup of her abo∣minable vanities; nor the gates of hell, though like the great red Dragon they vomit and cast vp conti∣nually floods of poyson; shall neuer be able to pre∣uaile against it. This Counsell and this Helpe, are the Pillar like feete of euery Noble Theophilus, who trea∣deth the steppes of Christ, & walketh in his pathes; and such a Theophilus may your Lordship be iustly accounted; for not onely by Counsel, as being one of the chiefest Oracles of this land, but also by Helpe, as being one of the best Nurcing fathers of the Church, your Honour seeketh the welfare of Zion, and the good of Gods Temple. It is not I alone that

say thus; but it is Musarum vox, the voice of the lear∣ned Twins of this Realme, the Two vniuersities, ma∣ny of whose sonnes had died and beene buried in their selles, had not your Honour called thē forth, and sent them into Gods vineyard; amongst these I may ranke my selfe, hauing lately tasted of your vnlookt for, and vndeserued bountie towards me: In liewe whereof, as a Sacrifice of Thanksguing, I of∣fer vp and dedicate to your honourable name, and protection, these my Labours, being the sincere testimonies of my thankefull heart; humblie desi∣ring almightie God, that as your Lordship hath bene a Pillar of his Temple vpon earth, so he would make you in the life to come, a Pillar of his Temple in heauen, and write vpon you his owne Newe name.
