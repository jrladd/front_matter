TO the consideration of your
fauourable constructions I
present these sixe yeares con∣tinued
trials from New En∣gland:
if you please to peruse
them, and make vse of them,
I am richly rewarded. The subiect deserueth a
farre better habit, but it is as good as the father
can giue it. Let not therefore a souldiers plain∣nesse
cause you refuse to accept it, how euer you
please to dispose of him, that humbly sacreth him∣selfe
and best abilities to his Countries good, and
the exquisite iudgement of your renowned per∣fections.
