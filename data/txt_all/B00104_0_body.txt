MY LORD,
ABoue three Yeares agoe, this Popish De∣maund, in the Iesuite's owne Hand-wryting, being given to
 that moste Religious Gentle∣man, and hopefull Branch, of that Noble Stocke, FRAN∣CIS HAY, Sonne to the Earle of ERROLL; with no lesse bragging, than that all the Ministers were not able to an∣swere it: Amongst the meanest of whome, it having pleased that worthie Gentle-man, to imploy my Paynes; I drew vp an Answere, at that tyme, more to giue him-selfe contentment, (whose constancie they would haue brangled) than any-wayes to satisfie those, who by the more learned Travels of others, could never yet bee made sen∣sible, in anie poynt of their er∣ronius Giddinesse, by that in∣ebriating Cup of their who∣rish Mother. Alwayes, since that tyme, how-so-ever, I ne∣ver
 heard more of that pur∣pose, and that the Demander re∣sted silent; yet the busie Surmi∣ses of late, and causlesse brags, of some of that Popish Crew, comming to myne Eares; al∣leadging in their vaunting and wanton humour, that a Demand had long a-goe beene made to some Ministers, concerning their BIBLES translation, and a mayne Article of the CREED; where-vnto they were never, hither-to, able to reply: Together with the ear∣nest desire of others, well-affe∣cted, hath made mee to revise my Paynes, and of new to put Pen to Paper; and so to bring foorth, to more publicke view, and more common benefite, what other-wyse was onlie in∣tended for a private vse: Wher∣by
 anie, of indifferent judge∣ment, may see, how justlie they beltch foorth their boysterous Brags, and heaue with the stile of Invincible, (as they did a-before their Spanish Armado) what-so-ever commeth from the Finger-tops of their ghost∣lie Fathers: as if their Brayne could hatch nothing, but a per∣fect Pallas: tho with a-lyke suc∣cesse of disappoyntment, that preparation, and their paynes, are seene to symbolize. The LORD grant, that still HIS CHVRCHES Foes, may be as a rolling Wheele, and as Stubble before the Wynde; whom He may persecute,Psal. 83.13. with His Tempest, and make afraid, with His Storme.
These Paynes, then, Most Noble, and Religious Lord, I
 haue for this cause dedicated to your learned Patronage; as One, both in Blood, and Affe∣ction, most neare, and entirelie linked with that Noble Gentle∣man, who instigated mee, first, to the taking of the same. And in respect your fervent loue to RELIGION, is not onelie evident; but also your zealous and judicious Defence of the TRVETH, at all fit occasi∣ons is not our, (to all those that know Your Honour) never to bee wanting: And who is able, therefore, sufficientlie, by Skill and Arte, to mayntayne against all Opposers, This, and what poynt so-ever else of sacred VERITIE, which shelte∣reth it selfe vnder the Shield of Your learned Patrocinie. Wi∣shing, also, that This may re∣ceyue
 such acceptation, accor∣ding to Your Lordships imbred courteous and gentle Disposi∣tion, that it may bee reputed, and remayne, as a small, but sincere Testimonie, of the most respectiue duetie, and entire af∣fection of one, who with the apprecation of all Happinesse, shall ever continue
