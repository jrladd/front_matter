In most humble wise sheweth,
THat Your Majesty's good Subjects, with much hard Labour and great Disbursements, have subdued a Wilderness, built our Houses, and planted Orchards, being incouraged by our indubitable Right to the Soil by the Royal Charter granted unto the First Planters, together with our Purchase of the Natives; as also by sundry Letters and Declarations sent to the late Governour and Company, from His late Majesty Your Royal Brother,

assuring us of the full enjoyment of our Properties and Possessions, as is more especially contained in the Declaration sent when the Quo Warranto was issued out against our Charter.
But we are necessitated to make this our Moan and Complaint to Your Excellent Majesty, for that our Title is now questioned to our Lands, by us quietly possessed for near sixty Years, and without which we cannot subsist. Our humble Address to our Governour Sir Edmond Andross, shewing our just Title, long and peaceable possession, together with our Claim of the benefit of Your Majesty's Letters and Declarations, assuring all Your good Subjects, that they shall not be molested in their Properties and Possessions, not availing.
Royal Sir, We are a poor People, and have no way to procure Money to defend our Cause in the Law; nor know we of Friends at Court, and therefore unto Your Royal Majesty, as the publick Father of all your Subjects, do we make this our humble Address for eâˆ£lief, beseeching Your Majesty graciously to pass Your Royal Act for the Confirmation of Your Majesty's Subjects, here in our Posessions to us derived from our late Governour and Company of this Your Majesty's Colony: We now humbly cast our selves, and distressed Condition of our Wives and Children, at Your Majesty's Feet, and conclude with the saying of Queen Esther, If we Perish, we Perish.
Thus that Petition.
