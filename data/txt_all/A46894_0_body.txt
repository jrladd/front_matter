I Am bold to present you with these following
Histories and Meditations; the which, if
 your liesure you will please to peruse,
though they be plaine, yet I doubt not, but they will
administer you some comfort, in regard they are e∣tracted
out of some choise places of holy Scripture,
which is the fountaine whence our chiefest consolati∣ons
flowe: and never any age did stand in more need
of spirituall comforts, then wee doe in these 
times of ours, which occasioned me to the com∣posing
of them, and I am in hope that they will 
equally profitable as they are seasonable. I shall desir
your favourable construction for some errours in th
Presse; or what failing may be in my selfe 
composure. So wishing you as much happy solace in
the perusing, as it pleased God to afford mee in 
penning of them, I rest,
From my chamber in
Holborn, 28. Septemb.
