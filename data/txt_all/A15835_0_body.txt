SIR, to giue you some Testimonie of my good will, I shall hazard to doe I know not what. Infinite are the books in this age: and of the greater number, we may say with Socrates, I he paper is more worth then the matter. Of Sermons, how many are extant? For who almost preacheth, that printeth not: In so much as the Presse may say vnto the Pulpit, in the words of Esau to his brother Iacob; Plurima habeo, sint tua tibi:
Gen. 32.9. Keepe that which thou hast, I haue enough. Yet haply, it may be the will of God, in these last and sinfull times, that our visions should bee written,
Hab. 2.2. and made plaine vpon Tables. In so great a multitude, mine, I confesse, might haue well stood out. But when I considered, it was not so much mine, as yours, for whom it was preached: nor so much yours as theirs, before whom it was deliuered, I was at length, not vnwil∣ling, (if it got forth in the crowde,)
Mal. 3.16. that it might be a Booke of re∣membrance vnto You, and the rest who shall succeede: wherein you may be admonished how weighty that office is which you beare; and what affections ought to possesse you in the course of your Gouern∣ment. Let me say therefore in the words of the Prophet: This com∣mandement is for you, and for those that come after you,
Mal. 2.1. in that place of Magistracie, euen this Precept of God to Moses; Carry them in thy Bosome. I once sent it to the care, now I present it to the eye, that one way or other it may get to the heart. Ʋnto this, I haue added one more, to beare it company: that these two, as the Twinnes of Hippocrates, may fare alike abroad in the world, either to laugh or mourne together. Both these I send and commend vnto you, and you vnto the word of his grace,
Act. 20.32. who is able to build you further, and to giue you an inheritance amongst them which are sanctified. Southwalsham, Iune 1. 1617.
