HAuing beene an Eare-witnesse
of that full satisfaction,
which vpon strict and long
Examination, your High∣nesse
yeelded my Lords
Grace of Canterburie, and
my Lord of Bath and VVels, in the Grounds
and Principles of Christian Religion, I was en∣couraged
to adde forme and life to these ensuing
Obseruations, lately collected touching Confir∣mation,
that from thence your Highnesse might
not onely be informed how iustly the Church of
England, together with many other godly and
vsefull Ceremonies, retayneth this laudable and

auncient Custome, but farther be induced to the
receiuing of it with the greater cheerefulnesse in
your owne Person, assuring my selfe that your
Highnesse Example will serue to draw on many
Inferiours, eyther to take it more commonly and
willingly themselues, or at the least, to esteeme
it more reuerently in others. Now the God of
Heauen, who hath planted that Grace in you,
which to the great content and comfort of my
Soule, I perceiue to encrease daily, confirme it in
you, and you in it, to the glory of his Name, the
good of his Church, and the Saluation of your
owne Soule.
