Noble Senators,
I Need not make my Apology, if I dedicate this little Dis∣course to You, because it most concerns You, not onely for that the Dishonor of Your own Members reflects on You all, but also for that You are first struck at, and these are but sparks of that fire, that have been first kindled (if possible) to consume You. As I have with much joy and admiration, in my solitary and private conversation, viewed the
 eminent actings of providences among You; so I have, with almost as much lamentation and wonder, bewailed the unhandsom and unsuitable deportments of mens spirits and actions, opposing of You; But most of all the exceeding boldness and impudency, together with the transcendent rage and venom of that generation of men which are truly called LEVELLERS, a Faction grown out of Your own Bowels, whom I know not what to call, but the putrifaction of GOD'S Mercies and Your Indulgencies, whose Principles, as they are begotten by the corruptions of Persons and Governments, so they are maintained and onely thrive by Tu∣mults and Confusions; a People who have as many Governments as Religions, and as little of the true Religion, as they have of Estates and Fortunes in this Nation; men of no more reputation, then what they get among discontented and bank-rooted persons, by holding forth taking and seeming Propositions of Levelling and Licentiousness: And yet these men are suffered (in perpetuum nostri seculi infamium) to scandalize Your Supream Authority, to raise Mutinies and Tumults against You, to slander Your most publique and active Instruments, and tolerated, yea, by many countenanced, as if they were the most useful Instruments, or had some mysterious glory in their Persons and Pamphlets, that it were Blasphemy for any sober man to speak against. But, among all this popular and seditious Gange, there is none hath more disho∣nored this Nation, and contemned Your Authority, then Lievtenant Colonel John Lilburn, their desperate and wretched Instrument, who thinks he can attain to no higher reputation, then to deny Your Authority: He hath called You once and again, a Junto, Colonel Prides Junto, a Mock-Parliament, a company of Theeves, and Murtherers, and Felons; made publique Libels against the Councel of State, the Army, General, Lievtenant General, all Your Officers; slighted all Your Orders, Ordinances, Acts, and glories in it to Your very faces; What a Reproach is this to Your Go∣vernment? What a Weakening to Your Cause, and Discourage∣ment to Your Friends? What an emboldening Your Enemies, that John Lilburn, a man of such an inconsiderable Interest, one who could hardly ever challenge more Land in England then might Geometrically serve to make his grave, should be suffered thus publiquely, and upon Record, to defame not onely Your Persons singly, but scorn Your very Government and Authority, as honest
 men do tyranny and inhumanity, without any signal punishment to the terror of the rest? And, if I may speak vox populi, the Vul∣gar think, Your Guilt is the cause of Your Patience, and his In∣nocency of his Boldness: and what arcanum imperii there may be in Your brests, I know not; But You little know, how these foolish Papers do Gangrene the most of men, and according to their dif∣ferent tempers and affections, have their divers and ominous oper∣ations: The worser sort of men rejoyce, and take heart, and feed their Malignant humors and discontents by them; The indifferent and moderate ones know not what to say, but think enough; The better sort, and Your Friends, are much disheartened, and stag∣gered, and have cause to think You are doubtful of Your own Au∣thority, since You are so cold in maintaining it. Pardon me, if I, out of the abundant sense of Your Honors and the Nations Happiness, be somewhat zealous in stirring You up to look about You. England hath been a stage of Glory and divine Manifesta∣tions: You have been carryed on, by a wonder of Providence, through many Difficulties, and have been made Instruments of gallant actions, among all which, that Act of Justice, done by You on the late King, renders You a Glory to This, and a Ter∣ror to all other Nations: And shall the Honor of these transacti∣ons (wherein the finger of the Almighty himself hath been de∣monstrable) be undermined by the discontents of a few Mechanick Levellers? or be suffered to be blasted by the puny pen of a di∣stracted Humorist? What will after ages say? What will other Nations think? Either maintain Your Government, or give Com∣mission to all men to affront You: It's Equity and Justice that some should be made Examples to others, now, as others have been made to them heretofore: If You give way to this, You shall not want abuses, and all Your Friends.
It is the opinion and serious judgment of many sober and wise, yea godly men, that bless GOD for this Change, and lament the miseries of the times, that one great occasion, if it be not a cause of this sort of mens opposition to you, flows from that unlimited Tole∣ration of RELIGION which is yet granted in this Nation, and think that there is somewhat divine and judicial in it, that the first fruits of their new Opinions and Principles should be the abusing your Authority and Government, that you may see be∣times what the end of such a Toleration will be, and prevent it.
 For it's most observable, that as it was the great and funda∣mental Principle in their Agreement of the People, (without which all other civil Grants was nothing,) so it may be almost mathematically demonstrated, that all that turn Levellers, first leave the Principles of Scripture-Religion, that they may be with∣out check of conscience for any civil disorder. Religion is a sa∣cred bond and tye on mens spirits, as well to Civil, as to Spi∣ritual Rules, and when once men forsake these Principles, no hearty or cordial obedience can be expected: As Tyrants and Politicians first strive to enslave mens consciences, and then they are sure of their persons; so when men mean to level all things to their lusts and humours, they first make shipwrack of a good conscience. And it's not to be wondered, that men should deny the common and ordinary Rules of Civil Government, who have professedly denyed all Rules and Institutions both of Law and Gospel; for though Religion and Civil Government be of different natures, yet they are commonly inter-woven together, as to the flourishing of each other; that Government shall never thrive where Religion is not advanced, nor will Religion much flourish in the midst of Factions or Schisms, or under Popular or Tyrannical Governments of States; yet commonly the one is blessed by the other, Gods design being to advance himself first, to set up his own Name, and then to prosper Nations.
I am constrained (Honourable Worthies) to represent this Consideration to you, that you would vindicate your own names in advancing Christs, and expect no hearty conjunction of any with you, in this Government, but honest and consciencious men, who can only be engaged by Principles of Religion, and Civil Freedom; for men that have left the Principles of the Scripture, the Rule of Religion, expect nothing else but they shall, as they find their lst act, soon oppose the most fundamental Maximes you can lay down as a basis to your Goverment. It is the fear of this unlimited Toleration makes many honest Presbyterians stand at such a distance, and so unwilling to submit to this change; yea, that makes you lose many a godly heart, which else would rejoyce in former acts done by you, while they see no more signal Character of favour and respect professedly set on the Principles of the Gospel, then on Heathenism, or Judaism, and con∣tinually hear Blasphemies spoken cum privilegio, at least without
 punishment. Is our Religion so uncertain, or doubtful, that it need to have false Religions to try it by? Is Blasphemy a less sin then it was? or, is Gods honor faln in its worth and excellency, that it should not be as much preserved as ever? God forbid. Liberty of Conscience must be given onely to men that can be supposed conscienciously to differ, not onely from Religion, but some externall way of practising the same Principle. But I leave it to Your wise and serious Consideration, onely present You with this Vindication of two of Your faithful and active Agents of this Nation, You have Power enough to vindicate Your own Authority; I can do no more then witness against the false and wicked aspersions of Lievt. Col. John Lilburn against them, and sub∣mit it to Your Iudgments, as those who ought to take the prime cogni∣zance of it, that You may know what Servants You, and this State hath, and what an evil and intolerable person this John Lilburn is to live under the favor and smiling aspect of such a State, or, which he makes the onely Butt of his madness and malice.
