HEau'n-shaking Wrath, pour'd out like flaming fire,
Bending the rockes, tearing the hils asunder,
Tossing the earth, and all things bringing vnder:
Who would not from the same in haste retire?
Me thinkes I quake whil'st I the same admire;
No wonder then such wet their couch with teares,
Who but in part conceiue these horride fear's,
Not knowing where to shrowd them from his ire.
A Fortresse strong I know you wish to gaine,
Whence sinne and Satan you may both defie:
Looke then in this where you your state may trie,
Freeing your selfe from feare of endlesse paine:
Much could I wish, but all must rest in this,
That euery thing may serue t' augment your blisse.
