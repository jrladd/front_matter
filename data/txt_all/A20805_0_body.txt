IF wee duly and
diligently as we
ought (men,
brethren & fa∣thers,) consi∣der
& obserue,
Gods vnspeake∣able
mercy & goodnesse towards
our English nation; not onely in
the fruition and continuance of
such vncomparable peace and
prosperitie aboue other countries
and king domes, and in the exqui∣site
and excellent knowledge of
liberall Artes and the learned lan∣guages:
but also (and that most

eminently) in the pure and pub∣like
preaching of Christ his bles∣sed
Gospell, in so many places and
parishes. Wee cannot but iudge
and acknowledge our selues to be
highly beloued, and admirably
blessed of Almighty God. But
contrariwise, if wee marke and
take notice of the merueilous
abuses of our peace and prospe∣ritie,
the exceeding contempt of
Artes and good learning, and
(that, which most aggrauateth
our iudgement) the generall neg∣lect
of piety, and the horrible hy∣pocrisie
of many in the profession
of sincere religion, and withall
call to remembrance the sundrie
and fearefull (if not ominous,)
warnings and iudgements that
God hath inflicted vpon vs in
these few last yeares, wee then
haue iust cause to feare, that God

hath reserued vs to some more
dangerous plagues, and that hee
will by degrees strip and depriue
vs of all his mercies. Wherefore
least wee should take ouer-much
offence at the prophanesse and
hypocrisie of the mvltitude, and
hereby faile and shrinke in our
holy courses and exercises of
godlinesse, or else should deceiue
our owne soules, because wee re∣teine
an outward forme and pro∣fession
of holinesse, and because
our outward tranquillitie & hap∣pinesse
yet continueth: two points
and conclusions must heedfully
be considered of vs. First, that the
number of sincere Christians and
vndissembling Gospellers, is very
rare: they are in comparison of
them that perish, but a remnant, a
gleaning after the haruest or vin∣tage,
a small flock, one of a Tribe,

and two of a Citie. The truth of
this assertion most euidently ap∣peareth
in the time of any gene∣rall
Apostacie and persecution,
1. Reg. 19. 14. Apoc. 12. ver. 5. and
6. and chapt. 13. ver. 7. and 8. and
shall be made manifest to all the
world, at Christ his second com∣ming,
when he shal scarcely finde
sauing faith vpon the earth. Luke.
18. ver. 7. 8. Therfore we may not
define and measure the truth of
religion by the esteeme and prac∣tise
of the erring multitude, but
wee must make Gods word the
onely rule and touchstone of our
faith and life. Secondly, for the
auoiding and preuenting of hy∣pocrisie,
which maketh vs odious
both to God and men, wee must
not so much (in a curious humor)
desire to know strange mysteries,
as to know that which most con∣cerneth

vs, and to make a good
vse and apply of our knowledge.
Againe, wee must in all our acti∣ons
and profession of religion,
propound to our selues no sini∣ster
ends. As for example, wee
must not intend gaine but god∣linesse,
not credit amongst men
(onely) but the glorie of God;
not policie, but piety, and not
the aduancing of our outward
state, but the amendment of our
liues, and the saluation of our
soules; and hereby we shall nota∣bly
and vnfallibly distinguish our
selues from all hypocrites what∣soeuer.
Lastly, we must with the
woman in the Apocalips, cloath
our selues with the sunne of righ∣teousnesse,
and tread the Moone,
that is, all changeable and transi∣torie
things vnder our feete, and
wee must with the wise Virgins,

whiles it is the time of grace, and
the day of saluation, prouide our
selues of the oyle of true saith,
get the garment of true holinesse
and keepe it vndefiled; and in
hope and patience waite long, and
wish for, the second comming of
Christ, when the mariage shall be
eternally solemnized betweene
the Bridegroome and vs in the
highest heauens. This doing we
shall be happy and blessed here
in hope and beginning, and after
this mortall life ended, in act and
perfection. And because, next
vnto the sacred ministery of the
word, and the spirituall exercises
of Christians, the publishing of
sound and elaborate treatises, are
a singular helpe and furtherance
herevnto, I, (in the mediocritie
of my skill) for the direction of
those that be well disposed, haue

compiled and framed this small
worke. Moreouer, because the
argument of it so fitteth your af∣fections,
being (generally) men
of religion and conscience, & in∣strumēts
of good, & because your
liberal kindnesse & long continu∣ed
beneficence hath bin so amply
extended to me, I doe most hum∣bly
and deuoutly dedicate it vnto
you all; most submissiuely, be∣seeching
you courteoussy to ac∣cept
of it, and to vse it for your
edification and comfort. In assu∣red
expectation whereof, I here
take my leaue.
The GOD of heauen, and
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,
remember in goodnesse all your
kindnesses shewed to his house,
and vnto so many of his seruants,
fill you with all wisedome and
spirituall vnderstanding, make

you fruitefull in all good workes,
prosper you in this world, and
make you euerlastingly blessed
in the world to come.
Amen.
