MY LORD,
THis peece is the A∣bridgement
of two Ser∣mons

which I lately made up∣on
this subject in our French
Congregation assembled in
your house. I was requested
by one of the most eminent and
most ancient Doctors of the
Church of England, & by
some of my ordinary hearers,
to publish it: Not but that
this Argument might have
been handled by others more
powerfully then by my self,
but for other reasons. I have
assayed to joyn brevity with
the Truth, knowing that you
love both the one and the

other: For to whom ought I
rather to present it then to
you, MY LORD, to whom
all our Assembly, and my
self in particular, are so
greatly and continually obli∣ged?
When we pray for
PHILIP Earl of Pembrook,
our hearts say, LORD,
he loves our Nation, and
hath built us a Synagogue.
In effect, the Ark of God
wanted a vaile for a cover∣ing,
and you have lodged it
in a house built of Cedars.
Accept, MY LORD,

that in these lines I publish
your charity towards us;
and the LORD prolong your
dayes, and powre upon you
and your Illustrious Family
his most pretious influences.
