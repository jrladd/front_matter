GODS gracious good∣nes in calling you not only to a Reli∣gious life in general, but to this particular Order, so eminently flourishing in Christs Church, & very House likewise where now you liue, cō∣seruing
it self in the primitiue fer∣uour, and exact obseruance of your holy Mother S. Teresa her Rule, to edify by your holy exā∣ple, and help also by your tem∣porall meanes poore Exiles, and Strāgers; seemeth equally to ar∣gue Gods fatherly care of them, and speciall loue to your Selfe: clay ming withall thankefull res∣pects from their English friends, and from my self in particuler, as hauing had the fauour affoarded me, of holding your Heauen∣ly spouse in my hands, whilst by your Profession, you espoused your selfe so ioyfully, and de∣uoutly vnto him, as to me and others then present, the ioy of your Nuptialls, seemed to haue byn, in heauen, and in earth, ce∣lebrated togeather.
And indeed the diuine Author of your vocation seemed then to
haue much pleased himselfe, in beholding his Graces so effectu∣all in you, as it may wel be doub∣ted, whether you imbraced them more feruorously at first, or put them in executiō more heroical∣ly afterwards, when deafe to cō∣trary persuasiōs of your worldly friends, and dexterously freed from that domesticall, and vniust Captiuity, whereby they had for some moneths together, forci∣bly restrayned you, getting a∣lone to the Monastery, and well assured, that the doore thereof would not, but with some bet∣ter allowance of your powerfull friends, be opened to receaue you (as the Reuerend Mother & Re∣ligious of themselues exceeding∣ly desired) with an heroicall re∣solution, scarcely to be exempli∣fied, you pulled of your secular rich cloathes, put your selfe in∣to
a small Wheele, seruing (as the manner is) to take in and out things needfull for the inclosed, left at that tyme by a rare chance vnlocked, and so turned your self into the place you desired, by such a strange meanes, as it no lesse amazed the Reuerend Mo∣ther, and Sisters to see a person of your knowne quality, kneeling almost naked before them, with flowing teares begging their ho∣ly habit, then it ioyed your selfe to haue gotten in so among them.
For surely to me, and others since, this entry of yours seemed almost miraculous, the straytnes of the Wheele, deuided into foure parts, and your tall stature considered; the deuise at least, & your manner of executing it, was (I doubt not) diuinely suggested and not without a mystery per∣formed, as the Religious mā prea¦ching
the day after your professi∣on, in a great Auditory of your owne friends, and other princi∣pall persons, well noted, when as he tould them, that Christ in his spirituall espousall of you, was pleased to obserue in a sort, what he had formerly commaunded to the Iewish Captaines, and soul∣diars, in marrying their beauti∣full captiues, Deut. 21. by not ad∣mitting you, captiued by loue vnto him, amongst his other pure spouses, there louely and beloued by him, but stripped first of secu∣lar garments, and made ready to haue a holier Habit put vpon you, exteriourly course, but in∣teriourly gracing you, in the eyes and hart of your diuine Louer, with the hidden bewties of holy soules chiefly delighted: wherin, I dare say, you are not meane, a∣mongst such as are excellent, so
far, as an immaculate purity of mind and body, with an inge∣nuous candor of Nature, inno∣cency of Life, admirable Humi∣lity, and a continuall ardour of diuine loue, often interrupting, and hindring whole nights to∣geather, the needfull repose of your senses, may argue deepe foundations laid of high buil∣dings likely heereafter, by the heauenly Architect, to be raysed in you, and his Blessed Mother, a continuall Leader and Helper of such pure soules into the bride∣roome, and inmost bed-cham∣ber of her sonne, there to be im∣braced graciously by him.
Wherfore I haue purposely heer collected her Life, a cleere Mir∣rour & Rule of all perfection, as S. Ambrose calleth it, & dedicated it, as a sincere testimony of my Religious respect, vnto you, and
that holy family; that English gentelwomen also, hapning by this occasion to read this history of your exemplar Vocation to Religion, and feruourous prose∣cution thereof (rather touched by me indeed, then fully related) may learne therby, how to leaue worldly friends, and temptations behind them, to enioy abroad, such sweet retyrements, & strait imbracings of their Heauenly Spowse, as their owne Homes cannot now affoard them.
Neither haue they to this pur∣pose, your Example alone, but the like also in many other emi∣nent Gentle-women of our na∣tion, who haue trampled secular Braueryes, neglected Worldly contentments and preferments, left their Country, and forsaken the delicacyes of their Parents houses, to enter into seuerall Mo∣nasteryes
abroad, as into so ma∣ny Bride-chambers of their hea∣uenly spouse, temporally first to serue, and eternally afterwards to enioy him; who lightneth his burden layd on them so by abū∣dant graces, and sweetneth his yoke by heauenly consolations, as they feele not almost the ap∣prehended austerities of a Religi∣ous life; but contrarily find such a peacefull sweetnes of consciēce, in the practise of them, as S. Ber∣nards saying is truly verifyed in them, who speaking of secular iudgments made concerning the paynefulnes of Religious disci∣pline, Cruces vident, consolationes non agnoscunt; they looke vpon our crosses, but know not our cōforts: this being (sayth S. Gre∣gory) the difference, inter delicias cordis & corporis between the de∣lights of the soule and the body,
that these latter are vehemētly ap∣prehēded, but by being experien∣ced quickly come to be loathed: whereas contrarily the other, are dully apprehended, but deligh∣fully tasted, tanto{que}ue a comedente ampliùs esuriuntur, quantò & ab esuriente ampliùs comeduntur, and by being more greedily eaten, they come to be more hungerly longed after: so as the Prophet biddeth vs first to tast, and then to see, how sweet God is, to his children and seruants.
I may well rāke your self amōg the happy enioyers of such hea∣uenly delights, since your liuing in that place hath byn as a conti∣nuall sitting at a full Table of them; & austerities there appre∣hended indeed to be farre grea∣ter, then young tender gentle∣women in experience find them, haue (as I haue byn certaynely
informed) byn no more felt by you, then bitter pills wrapped in sugar, come to be tasted by such as sodainely swallow them.
Shall I say (& perchance truly) Gods gracious fauors to haue bin the greater towards you, for lea∣uing in a sort your Country and friends, as your companions haue actually done theirs, by liuing so amongst strangers in it, as if you were quite out of it? If it be so, you are worthily to esteeme (as to my knowledge you do) your pregnant Vocation to that House, a singular grace of God; and your Admission therein, a particuler fauour, commonly de∣nied by the Religious of our na∣tion, who are knowne in all pla∣ces to refuse strangers, albeit ve∣ry worthy persons, amongst thē, as I for my part therby conceaue the odour of their holy Exam∣ple
to be very sweet, and plea∣sing to God, it being able so to attract strangers, diuinely also guided, vnto them.
