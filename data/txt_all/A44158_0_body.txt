My LORDS,
WERE the Occasion of my writting this small Treatise, but Common and Indifferent, I would not have pre∣sumed to Address Your Lordships, especially being a Private Man, and of another Nation, but since the Greatest Interests of the Kingdim are concerned in the Matter now in Dispute, I hope your Lordships will not reckon me guilty of a Fault.
It is well known to your Lordships, of what Importance the Indi∣an and African Trade is thought to be to this Nation, the number of the Subscribers, and the quickness of the Subscriptions, supposes Men have Great Expectations of its Success, and it is become a Sign of Disrespect to the Common Good of the Kingdom, not to be concern∣ed in it; Or at least, not to Approve of it, and to pay a more than Ordinary Respect to the Projectors of it.

It is the Opinion of most Men, that this Indian and African Com∣pany, will do the Nation very much Good, or very much Hurt, some express it, That Scotland must either be Happy or very Unhappy, by the Success thereof. It is indeed hard to tell the Event of Things in most Cases, but in this, a Man but of Common Understanding, may give a Shrewd Guess, when the Beginnings of this Great Afair, is to the Prejudice, and upon the Plain Right of another Company, Constituted by the same King and Parliament, and is a Business which cannot hinder, but help all Trade.
When Men have evil Designs, it is not hard to find out Plausible Pretences to carry them on, tho for this of a Bank or Fund of Cre∣dit, to be joyned to the Indian and African Company, there never was less shew of Reason, for the Parliament have made the Act for the Bank, and the Act for the Indian and African Company so distinct from one another, that there is all the Reason in the World, to Hope the Bank will be Incouraged and Protected.
And since the Business of the Indian and African Company, is for a Trade that your Lordships and the greatest part of the Nation are not well Acquainted with; And also, because the Setters up of this pretended Fund of Credit do misrepresent Things, I thought it pro∣per to direct this Discourse to Your Lordships, that you may take more particular notice of the Matter in Dispute, and discountenance what your Lordships shall think may tend to the Dishonour and Prejudice of the Nation
I will (with Your Lordships Favour) mention one Instance, which
was offered to the Directors, and General Council of the Indian and African Company at their last General Metting; To wit, That the English East Indian Companys, Cashiers or Secrataris Notes, pass currently in Payment for the Companys Use. My Lords, that this is not so, will appear upon due Enquiry, for I never saw or knew of any such Notes, Altho I was about eight Years almost every day con∣versant in that Business, and for several Years since, have had Op∣portunity to know the Affairs and Methods of that Company. And they are in the like Error in the Instances they give of other Com∣panies for Trade, on purpose to carry on their Design of a Bank, But since that the Stock of the Indian and African Company, is so great a part of the whole Stock of the Nation, and that so much depends upon the Success thereof, it is worthy Your Lordships Consider∣ation (and that also of all others who Love their Countrey) whither these Mens Assertions are to be depended upon.
The bare giving out that the Indian and African Trade cannot be carried on without a Bank, or Fund of Credit, hath already pre∣vailed so far, That its thought by many the Exclusive Clause in the Act for the Bank, nor any thing else can stand in their way; But al∣tho it could be proved, (which never can, or that their Project would any way help the Indian and African Trade) I will never believe, but that this Nation will have a due Regard to the Pub∣lick Faith, And Apprehend the sad Consequences, not only to the Bank, but to the other Interests of the Kingdom, by the Breach thereof.

However, For Vindicating the Justice of the Nation, and assert∣ing that the Parliament, Your Lordships, and the Ordinary Court of Justice, will determine this Matter, according to the Plain Mean∣ing of the Parliament in their Act for the Bank of Scotland, I am unkindly dealt by, yet I will not be discouraged to continue my Wishes and Endeavours for the Prosperity of this Kingdom, and at all times to approve my self
My LORDS,
