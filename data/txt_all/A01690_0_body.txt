Right honourable,
AS is the nature
of warre, so is
the state of this dedi∣cation.
No warre is
held lawfull, which

hath not a speciall re∣ference
to peace. And
this discourse of warre
hath nothing in it
cōmendable, but that
it is deuoted to your
Lordship, the State
oracle of Counsell, and
Preseruer of peace.
In which case I haue
beene more bold to
make you the Patron
of my endeauours, be∣cause
you haue deig∣ned
already to be the

Protectour of my per∣son.
Not knowing to
whom more fitly I
might nuncupate a
Sermon of GOD
and GIDEON
(the two Supporters of
euery Souldiers armes,
the ground vpon which
euery field is to bee
pitcht) then to
him who represent∣eth
both mediately the
person of GOD, and
immediately the per∣son

of GIDEON.
I humbly therefore
beseech your Honour
to accept it candidly
according to the mo∣dell
of the Offerer,
not the magnitude of
the Receiuer, whose
Patronage I shall ac∣count
the best title
to it, and the come∣liest
couer your coun∣tenance,
and the on∣ly
cum priuilegio your
approbation. VVhich

whilest your Ho∣nour
shall vouchsafe,
I in the meane time
shall not cease to en∣large
this little sche∣dule
by greater vo∣lumes
of continu∣all
Praiers for your
Lordshippes welfare,
that the LORD
would please to bee
your Keeper on earth,
and seale you a∣mong
the number
of them that haue

the marke of the
Lambe in heauen.
