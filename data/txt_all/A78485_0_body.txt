May it please your Honours,
The humble Proposers observing some unnecessary charges and delay introduced by the corruption and multitude of Offices and Officers, which still in∣creased, besides some inconveniences that the corrup∣tion of time had produced, the same being more obvious to them then others by reason of their experience in the pra∣ctise of the Law: for remedy thereof consulted how to ap∣ply themselves to the Parliament, and to that purpose had severall meetings together, wherein the Proposals now pre∣sented to your view were agreed on, as things that would conduce much to the ease, benefit, and safety of the Suiter, security of Creditors and Purchasors, make good provision against the most generall inconveniences, prevent many frivolous and unnecessary suits, both at Law and in equity, shorten the processe in many, and ease the charge in all; and (which is not the least of their ambitions) take away those aspersions that seem to blemish that Law, the Law of Eng∣land,
which they humbly conceive to be the most perfect Law of any humane Law in the World; a Law that ad∣mits Nullum absurdum, that admits nothing against the Laws of God or nature, against reason, or repug∣nant to any other Learning, wherein all matters of fact are adjudged and tried by twelve able discreet and in∣different neighbours to the place where the matter of fact arises, and the matters of Law are debated, ad∣judged, and determined by as many of the most ancient, grave, and learned Lawyers of the whole Common wealth, who for their great experience, integrity, and wisdome, are first deservedly called to the state and degree of Serjeants at Law, and after to be Judges; and the processe of this Law is so quicke, that it seldome happens any cause at Law depends above three or foure Termes; but covetousnesse, the root of all evill having built some Flood-gates upon the chanell thereof, whereby the course hath been obstructed, stopt, or diverted out of its due course, and thereby more care taken to catch the Fish for the benefit of the Officers, then for the dispatch or advance of the Clients businesse, and the Proposers being unwilling to trespasse upon the Freehold of others by pulling down the Wares themselves, have by the drawing the chanell a neerer way in some Cases, and in other upon a lower flat, have neverthelesse so orde∣red the businesse, as they humbly conceive that most of the Grist will be ground without paying Toll at those unne∣cessary Milnes. And because Reformation wrestles with many difficulties, it being hard to finde an Ephesus with∣out some Demetrius, or some Criticke that will conclude the Shrubs seeke the fall of the Cedars, hoping thereby to advance their own tops: the Proposers have been very ten∣der not to propose any thing that may in the least degree seem to advance their own Interests, but many things that
will turn to their particular losse, they alwaies preferring the publique good before their own particular interests. Neither have they rashly herein proceeded, having at least spent ten moneths in the conception, digesting, considering on, and composing of what they now present to your more grave considerations; and as they are not the issues of rash braines, so they have not passed without perusall and corre∣ction of many others of good judgement and experience, and are now to live and die under your Honourable censures: whereby if you shall receive any light to the furthering the good work in hand, or the Republique any benefit the Pro∣posers have their wished ends, and humbly therein submit themselves and these their poore labours to your better judgements, by the hands of the most humblest of
