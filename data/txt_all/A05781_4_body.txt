IN all the Greeke None but this word is found,
That doth containe a true description,
Of vertues Cardinall, which d on abound
In thine Heroy call disposition▪
Agape shewes thy compositio
Loue it is called in our Dialect▪
EROS is Venerie; but this Diection,
Chast, holy, modest, diuine and perfect,
Arcadian Sydney gaue thee this aspect,
When he forsooke this transitore Globe,
To mount the whirling Orb with course direct,
Adorning thee with loue for marriage Robe.
Sith famous WOTH Agape hath possest:
Ourania pray's a while to be your guest.
