SIR,
My intentions wandring upon the limits of vain cogitati∣ons, was at the last arrived at the prospicious brinks of an Anglicis of per∣formance; where seeing Diana and Ve∣nus in a martial combat, and such rare atchievements performed by so two inini∣mate Goddesses, did lend to the aspect of their angelical eyes my selfe to be the sole spectator of their foregoing valour; where then their purpose was to choose me their Arbitrator; the which I perceiving, did

with a milde complexion (knowing my selfe impotent) relent backwards, think∣ing thereby to lose less credit, and gaine more honour, to set pen to paper, and to relate some certain and harmless Dia∣logues that while I was present betwixt them past, which is this Poem; And having now compos'd it, did then take care upon whose shoulder to father this my abortive infant: So then examining the Store-house of my friends, after some si∣lent search did finde no splendor of friend∣ship to be more orient in my eyes then yours, unto whose favour I commit this my poor Elf, it being the first (as yet) I presented to any, though not the first I writ; for certain it is I writ two Books of the same nature, viz. The Severall Affairs, a Comedy; and The Chast Virgin, a Romance; but they have been my pocket companions, and but

shown to some private friends: So desi∣siring your candid acceptance, which if it not finde it will carp the Blossome of my youth; but if it do, it will incourage mee to perform that work I now have in hand, which may deserve better your ac∣ceptance, and accumilate joy upon him; who is
Sir,
