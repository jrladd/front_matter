MOST Honourable and bountifull Ladie, there bee long sithens deepe sowed in my brest, te seede of most entire loue & humble affection vn∣to that most braue Knight your noble brother deceased; which taking roote began in is life time somewhat to bud forth: and to shew thē∣selues to him, as then in the weakenes of their first spring: And would in their riper strength (had it pleased high God till then to drawe out his daies) spired forth fruit of more per∣fection. But since God hath disdeigned the

world of that most noble Spirit, which was the hope of all learned men, and the Patron of my young Muses; togeather with him both their hope of anie further fruit was cut off: and also the tender delight of those their first blossoms nipped and quite dead. Yet sithens my late cumming into England, some frends of mine (which might much preuaile with me, and indeede commaund me) knowing with howe straight bandes of duetie I was tied to im: as also bound vnto that noble house, (of which the chiefe hope then rested in him) haue sought to reuiue them by vpbraiding me: for that I haue not shewed anie thanke∣full remembrance towards him or any of thē; but suffer their names to sleep in silence and forgetfulnesse. VVhome chieflie to satisfie, or els to auoide that owle blot of vnthanke∣fulnesse, I haue conceiued this small Poeme, intituled by a generall name of the worlds Ruines: yet speciallie intended to the renow∣ming of that noble race, from which both you and he sprong, and to the eternizing of some of the chiefe of them late deceased. The which

I dedicate vnto your La. as whome it most speciallie concerneth: and to whome I ac∣knowledge my selfe bounden, by manie singular fauours & great graces. I pray for your Honourable happinesse: & so humblie kisse your haudes.
