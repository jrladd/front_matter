Honorable Sir,
BENEFITS, they
say, are alwayes best
giuen, when they are
most concealed, but
thanks when they are made
most knowne. Giue my
priuate estate leaue there∣fore
to borrow the Art of
the Printer, which is the
publike Tongue of the lear∣ned,
to expresse my selfe
(though with no other lear∣ning
then what your kinde
respects haue taught mee)

most gratefull vnto you: who
indeed am bound, though
principally, yet not onely to
your Honoured selfe, but totj
Gentj tuae, to the worthy
Lady your mother, the reli∣gious
Knight, Sir Nathaniel,
your second Father, & with∣out
thought, not beyond my
desire, to your most noble &
learned Vncle, the Right
Honorable Francis Lord
Verulam, Viscount Saint
Albones my free and ve∣ry
Honourable Benefactor,
whose Gift, as it was wor∣thy
his bestowing, so was
it speedily sent, and not
tediously sued for; Honou∣rably
giuen, not bought
with shame, to one whom
he neuer knew or saw, but
onely heard kindly slaunde∣red
with a good report of o∣thers,
and opinion concei∣ued

by himselfe of sufficien∣cie
and worth. For by your
Fauours I confesse, my e∣state
is something, but the
sence of my pouertie much
more increased. For if we
may beleeue Neros wise
Maister and Martyr; There
is none so poore, as he who can∣not
requite a benefit: but I
am glad your Estates will
be alwayes beyond any re∣taliating
kindnesses of mine
who could not, indeed, with
out doing you much iniury,
wish my selfe able to make
you amends.
As therefore Aristippus
came to Dionysius, so doe I
to you. 
Hauing
receiued what I wanted, to
returne what I had. Though
in trueth this small pesent
may bee better sayed to bee

giuen by you to others,
then by my self to you, who
thought it worthy of more
mens reading then your
owne, which I pray God it
may be. Surely if there be
any worth in it, it is in the
dignitie of the matter, and
the fitnesse of it, for our na∣ture
and times. The mat∣ters
are the Grounds, Ex∣ercise
and Reward of the
faithfull, Heauenly Light
Bodily labour, Spirituall
rest. The first of which
brings with it light for our
Soules; the second, Health
for our bodies, and the third
for them both eternall Bles∣sednesse.
But in our times
there is three Vertues are
so great strangers, in which
there are so many euill
heartes of vnbeliefe, all
standing ready to depart

from the liuing God, that
wee had need to offer a ho∣ly
violence to our nature,
and to fall out with our
times, that fall so fast away
from God, or else it is to be
feared least the tide and
streame of them both carry
vs not into the riuers of
Paradise, there to bee lan∣ded
vpon the mountaines
of our saluation, but into the
riuers of Brimstone, whe∣ther
all are wasted that de∣part
from GOD: as him∣selfe
telleth vs; Depart from
mee yee cursed into euerla∣sting
fire.
And so much the more
need had wee, that liue in
this last Age of the world,
to looke to the infirmitie of
our natures and diseases of
the time: because natural in∣firmities
are alwayes grea∣test

Tyrants in our Age,
and it is no otherwise in
this old world, then in old
persons: If we were borne
weake sighted, it is a ven∣ture
but in age a great dim∣nesse,
if not a totall blind∣nesse
doe not befall vs. If a
lame hand by nature hath
disabled the actions of our
youth; the hand which in
youth could doe little, will
doe nothing in our age; if
we haue traduced a personal
inclination from our pa∣rents
to any vice, it is a
grace if that inclination
grow not to an affection in
our youth, and in our age to
a habite. So fast grow the
ill weedes of Nature when
Nature it selfe decayes in vs.
Now wee cannot bee
ignorant that in the very
Spring of nature, these three

strong infirmities were see∣ded
in vs. The first vpon
the effacing of Gods Image,
a dimme eye-sight or dark∣nesse
in our soule: the se∣cond
a lame hand or idle∣nesse
in the body, which
grew when Mortalitie first
broke in vpon vs, and left
our nature consumed of that
first-borne strength it then
flowrished with: bringing
in vpon our labour an ac∣cursed
sweat, vpon our
sweat, wearinesse, and con∣sequently
faynting, and
languishing the whole bo∣dy
with vnrest, and disease:
The third vpon the losse of
our heauenly inheritance,
an inclination and affecti∣on
of the whole man to
such a happinesse, as wee
cannot build for our selues,
out of the beautie and de∣lights

lights of this world: which
Salomon happily alluded vn∣to
Eccles. 3. 11. where
speaking of Humane happi∣nesse,
to reioyce, and doe
good, that is, to eate and
to drinke, and to enioy the
good of all our Labour,
verse 13, (Which questi∣onlesse
is therefore lawfull,
because it is there sayd to
bee the gift of GOD) hee
telleth vs, that, God hath
made euery thing beautifull
in his season, and hath set
 Coelum, the worlde,
as it is translated, or the de∣sire
of perpetuitie in their
heartes, so that no man can
finde out the worke that God
maketh from the beginning to
the end. Whereas it seemes
to me, Salomon allowing vs
this Humane felicitie, as
good in it selfe, yet secretly

accuseth it (by reason of the
immoderate affection, and
desire of perpetuitie wee
cast after it) for blinding
the eye of our considerati∣on
so farre, as thereby wee
cannot finde out the worke
that God maketh from the
beginning to the end: which
doublesse can bee no other
then his worke of our Re∣demption,
purposed from
all eternitie in CHRIST
our Lord who therefore as
himself is called ,
the first borne of all
creatures, so his day is cald
Nouissimus Dierum, the last
of all dayes, he onely being
(as himselfe witnesseth)  & 
and the Frst, and the Last,
the beginning of all things,
and the ende of all things.
Colos. 11. and in this worke
onely consists the know∣ledge

of our perfit happines
wherein is both perpetuitie
and sufficiency, which work
of Gods, most men there∣fore
cannot finde out,
because they acquiet their
desires with this humane
felicitie, and lie downe vn∣der
Issachars blessing, which
indeed, is but a cursory and
viatorie happinesse, seruing
vs onely for the time and
by the way.
These then are the three
great diseases of our soules,
bodies, and persons; Blind¦nesse
of Spirit, Idlenesse of
Body, Loue and rest in the
world; which the begin∣ning
of the world, made
by corruption, naturall; and
the Age of the world, by
the second nature, and of
custome, hath made delight
full to vs. And truely, if our

owne experience did not
teach vs how most men in
our daies placed themselues
in these infirmities, and
with what delight wee are
ignorant, idle, and enamo∣red
of the world: yet the
Oracles of GOD would
plainely euidence it vnto vs,
wherein wee shall finde it
prophecied of this last tem∣pest
of the world, that it
should bee full of seducing
Spirits to infidelitie, of idle
busie bodyes, of louers of
pleasures, more then louers
of GOD, To cure which
three great diseased of our
natures, and our times I
haue sent abroade by your
perswasion (and there∣fore
haue burdened you
with the Patronage of it)
this short Praescript, which I
pray GOD may worke by

the power of his Spirit
soundnesse in vs. To the ri∣ches
of whose grace, I most
entirely commend you,
and rest
