Honoured Sir,
IT might be judged my folly, should I here take upon me to informe you; My forget∣fulnesse if I should mind you, that it is the commendation of those starres fixt in the Heavens of the Nations, (in the most anomalous times) to know no Eccentricks, nor any motion but what is direct. As the fining pot for silver,
Prov. 17.21 and the furnace for gold, so is a man to his praise. To be upright in a warping Generation,
. Phil. 2.15. Numb. 4.24. and to follow the Lord wholly, argues that nature and spirit in the subject which act's few of Adams children, and in∣dulgeth no compliance with those interests, which draw men aside from serving the counsell of God in difficult and criticall seasons. There is an houre of tempta∣tion now come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the earth, and what with the di∣vine providences, really disserving the ends of some
men, and the pretences of others, to conscientious dis∣satisfactions, such a number have shrunk from their high callings,
Psal. 90.17 that could not the mighty God do his own work by a few as well as by many, wee might sit down and dispaire the establishing what by his pre∣sence for many years with our counsels and Armies, hee had in mercy wrought for us,
1 Sam. 12, 22. but the Lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake, be∣cause it hath pleased him to make them his people.
Sir,
That this God would continue you [among the rest of his called, and chosen, and faithfull Ones] a blessing to this poore Nation, that hee would make you an honour to your honourable family, and accepted of the multitude of your Brethren,
Esth. 10.3. as hee, who sought the wealth of his people, and spake peace to all his seed, that hee would perfect your joy, and crown, and enable you to stand compleat in all his will, that an entrance may be ministred to you abundantly, into the everlasting kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, is that which he strives for at the Throne of Grace, who is
Sir,
