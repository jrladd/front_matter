May it please your most excellent Majesty;
THat the ample testimony of Sir. Thomas Mid∣dleton lately tendred to your Sacred Majestie touching my preparation of the Spirit of Salt, as to the difference thereof from that vulgarly prepared, might receive some farther confirmation: And that that worthy persons commendation of me in that respect might obtain at least your Majesties excuse. It hath happily been so ordered, that the eminent virtues of the said Spirit should approve themselves to the world by several experiments, a few of which out of many, lest I should be tedious, taken from Patients own Letters, and from such as have made their observations of it upon themselves and others, I do here humbly submit unto your Majesties inspection, having added hereunto many testimonies, if perhaps by such means the pre∣paration of this excellent medicine, especially in Scorbutick distempers (familiar as hath been observed unto your Majes∣tie's, Kingdomes,) may be admitted, and receive no discou∣ragement from those who are pleased at present to think other∣wise of it than experience hath evinced to be true.
