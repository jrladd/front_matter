My Lord,
SInce your Honor was pleased to approve the Design I drew for your then intended Garden at Bromley, and fearing to be pre∣vented through Age and other in∣firmities of further serving your Lordship therein, I thought it my duty to give you some account, with what Plants, Fruits, and Flowers it ought to be furnished, when you shall please to accomplish that noble intend∣ment; and having now finished this Florilege, in all humility I present it to your honour; if it prove so fortunate to be thought worthy your perusal, you will find it aiming at the advancement of an Art, as laudable as delightful, and able to acquaint you with all the glories of our best Gardens, as also how to instruct your own Gardeners, not only in the names, but likewise in the natures, kinds, and qualities, of every Plant, Fruit, and Flower, fit to be collected by

the best Florists; together with the order to be used in their Cultivation, Planting, Propagation, and Im∣provement: a knowledge rarely found among those of that profession, and never untill now (in so plain a method) made publick; which, had it not been for the occasion of expressing my duty and affection to your Honour, certainly had perished in the first conception, and never appeared in Print: so from you chiefly re∣sults the profit or pleasure all others shall partake by this community of forty years Experience, which possi∣bly may be as many as desire to have good Gardens, and bear any affection to that honest and innocent re∣creation of Planting.
And although our Countrey cannot boast the be∣nignity of that beautiful Planet, which meliorates their Fruit in Italy, France and Spain; yet by refle∣ction from good walls, well-gravelled walks, the choice of fit kinds, and positions proper to each particular, we may plentifully partake the pleasure, and yearly enjoy the benefit, of many delicious fruits; as also the admiration and delight in the infinite varieties of elegant forms, various colours, and numerous kinds of

noble Plants, and beautiful Flowers, some whereof have been heretofore handled by a renouned person of your Name, but, since his time, Nature hath discove∣red many new Varieties, not known to former ages, as I hope shortly will appear in your own Collections, glo∣riously adorning your spacious Garden, which I wish may correspond, both in Fashion, and Furniture, with that noble Structure to which it appertaineth.
My Lord, when I consider the Nobility of your Extraction and dearest Relations, Ample Fortune, and Opulent Expectations, the Excellence of your Natural Inclinations, and the beautiful qualities you have ac∣quired by a happy Education, refined by Foreign Tra∣vels to sublime Perfection, I conclude this book as for∣tunate in the Dedication, as my hopes assure me of your Protection. Your noble Name as an Amulet is alone able to preserve it from the poysonous breath of malicious Ignorance, and no Sciolist dare presume to Censure what you shall please to Patronize.
Accept then my Honoured Lord, this humble of∣fering, which possibly may live to do you service, when

I am dust and ashes, and, according to my highest am∣bition, remain as a testimony of my sincerest gratitude for the many favours I have received from your Ho∣nour, your most accomplished Lady, and that noble Family from whence she is descended. I should here add my prayers for your Honours preservation, did I not reserve them for my morning Sacrifice, daily to be presented to the immortal Deities by him that is
