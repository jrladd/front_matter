mount Gerizim, in this life; and in the next, all the blessings which Christ preached on the Mount; may be mul∣tiplied upon your sacred Majesty, in your owne Person, and in your Po∣steritie; in our most gracious Queene MARY; in our most hopefull Prince CHARLES; and in all the rest of your Majesties most royall Issue. Thus prayeth
Your Majesties most humble and prostrate Subject,
