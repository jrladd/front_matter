ALthough my present condition wherein I stand clouded with the scandalous infor∣mations of malicious Adversaries, might justly discourage me from adventuring these Papers into your Presence: yet that impartiall Justice, which ought to be conspicuous in all Courts of Judicature, together with the Conscience of mine own Innocency, hath embold∣ned me hereunto. It is now full three Months, since I received a Coppy of an Order for the Sequestring of the Rectory of Flordon in the County of Norfolk from me, wherein were mentioned the things whereof I am accu∣sed, and for which that Order was granted out against me: Concerning which, as in the generall, all of them are most unjustly layd to my Charge, so in particular, touching that blasphemous, and dangerous Assertion, that The Scriptures lead men to destruction, (my Witness is on High, my Record is with the Almighty) it was so far from my Tongue to utter, that it never entred into my heart to conceive. It was my endeavour to have cleered my self of this horrible Scandall, before the Committee for Examination at Norwich; for one of the Witnesses produced against me, having affirmed that about New-years-time, three years since, preaching on Isa 9.6. The Government shall be upon his shoulder, I did say those words; repairing to my Papers, out of my briefer notes, I drew out the substance of all that ever I delivered upon
that Text, & having there tendered the same, I offered to attest it upon Oath: but the Commissioners were pleased rather to receive my Sermon upon my bare word (none of the Witnesses against me being examined upon Oath) that they might transmit it to be perused with my Cause: But contrary to their Intention, and my Expectation, by what means I know not, that my Sermon, though transmitted, never came to your judiciall view: whereupon all was taken for granted, which my Adversaries had Affirmed against me.
I have therefore here humbly presented the same un∣to you, having added thereunto my Sermon upon the foregoing words, humbly craving your Honourable Te∣stimony thereunto. I had taken a far more compendious way for my Vindication, than this, had not a long and te∣dious sickness prevented me; In which time my Adver∣sary Witherell, knowing I was not able to stir out of my Chamber, much less to be present at Westminster to make my defence, (he having had three severall daies before against me, but without success) procured a day against me, whereof I had not the least notice, that so he might with the more facility effect what maliciously he had intended against me. This his prosecution of me, however acted under Religious Pretences, yet upon con∣sideration of some Circumstances, it will easily appear to all indifferent and unbyassed men, to have been but a Ma∣chevillian practice of his, turning Religion into Policy, and making it but a Nose of wax, or a stalking horse to serve his own ends: imitating seditious Clodius, who although he were not only an Enemy to Religion, but also a contemner, and despiser of the same, yet would he pretend Religion in the behalf of all the Villanies he committed in his Tribuneship.
This Man was sometimes an Apprentice in Norwich, from whence (having married his Master's Daughter) he went into Holland: And in process of time having there run himself very deeply into debt, he repaired unto some of his Friends in England for relief: and about two years and four months since came to this Town of Flordon, to
a certain Farm, which one Mr Brian Witherell, sometimes of Silam in Suffolk his Uncle (at whose cost and charge he was maintained in Holland) gave unto three of his Children: Here therefore he setled himself, and sold Tobacco, and such like Merchandize; but neither the be∣nefit he received by his Trading, nor his Uncles bounty could satisfie him, unless he might swallow a Pecce of Gleabland belonging unto me, and without any contra∣diction ever yeelded to my Predecessors: In which his irregular and unjust desires because I withstood him, ha∣ving in April 1649. taken away some Firing that grew there, his malice and hatred hath ever since been so great towards me, as that he endeavoured to deprive me of all that I had, & to render me odious, wheresoever he could: 'twas his dayly practice to enquire first of one, then of another concerning me, if possibly he might have where∣of to accuse me: He went about to perswade divers of my Townsmen to joyn with him against me, telling them, that if I were once ejected they should pay for their Tithes but after the rate of twelve pence in the Pound: at the length he composed Articles (apparently more ma∣licious than true) and procured some Witnesses who (God forgive them) did in part affirm them: Nay, he was not ashamed, at the time, when his Witnesses were examined, to Dictate unto them what to say (as he did this gross Slander concerning the holy
Though he never heard me Preach, but only Nov. 24. Anno 1648. Scriptures) till up∣on my request one of the Commissioners Commanded him to forbear; and that all this was done against me out of private Interest, appears from his own Mouth; for he said, that had I not taken away that Firing, he had never molested or disquieted me; and that he might the better mannage this his unjust prosecution, and the more dis∣able me for the making of my defence, he hath detained, and doth yet against all right, equity or conscience keep back from me all Tithes and Profits due from him for the two years last past.
May it therefore please you of this Honourable Com∣mittee, to take this great and insufferable wrong into your serious consideration; so as that upon a re-hearing I may
receive so much favour as the justness of my Cause may seem to deserve: More I must not expect from your Justice; less I cannot expect from your Goodness. The more the wrongs be that I have received by those slanderous Imputations, the more necessity is laid upon me to crave your Honourable Aide and Assistance. As none would ever have offered to tax me in such an opprobrious manner but this malicious Accuser; so there is none for whom it is more proper to help me in this case than your Selves, to whom I have here humbly represented my oppressed condition, resting
 Flordou Octob. 19. Anno 1650.
