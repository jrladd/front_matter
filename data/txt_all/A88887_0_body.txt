ROYAL SIR,
THE more I reflect upon the gracious favour your Ma∣jesty hath done me, by cal∣ling me to be one of your Majestie's servants: The more my mind is raised and excited to ap∣ply wholly her self to the study and dis∣quisition of the Contexture and Com∣pound, and of the resolution of Natural
bodies: whereby those wonderful Ver∣tues, and specifical proprieties which Na∣ture hath hidden in their Center, may be discovered & laid open. And as your Ma∣jesty is eminently versed in the nature of good, and knows, that good can only be properly called so and reputed such, inso∣much as it is more obvious to the under∣standing, and more communicable in the practice; so likewise have I begun to follow this heroical Idea, from the time I did live in France, and there teach Chymical Phi∣losophy, I did then by vocal expression declare as much as I was capable to do; and since GREAT SIR, I have com∣piled in French this Book; which now be∣ing made English by one of your Maje∣sties Servants (a lover and great admirer of this noble Art) I presume to dedicate unto your Majesty; that having the stamp of this Language upon it self, it may go
more currant amongst, and be better un∣derstood by your own subjects, by whom your Majesties Royal inclinations to the publick good being generally so well known through the vast extent of your Majestie's Dominions, this Gentleman hath concurred with me in the laudable in∣tention of seconding this tendernesse, and paternal care of your Sacred Majesty, for preserving & restoring the health of those three Nations which Providence hath subjected to your sacred Empire, and for instructing those which dedicate them∣selves to the practice of the Noblest and best kind of Pharmacy. To this end, I say, hath been translated this which I had written, that it might become more fami∣liar and useful to the one for their health, to the other for their information and im∣provement of their knowledge. I hope, SIR, I shall have the good fortune from
henceforth to produce some other things, which may best contribute to the satisfa∣ction of that sublime, Heroical, and most worthy curiosity of your Majestie's dis∣cerning Genius, and which according to your own Royal desire and intention shall finde a success towards the good and advantage, both of sick and healthy, it is the earnest wish of him, who to his last breath shall ever be,
Royal Sir,
