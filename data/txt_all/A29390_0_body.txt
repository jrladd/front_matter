SIR,
I Should have offered a palpa∣ble Injury to the Memory of my Lord, your Deceased Fa∣ther, if I had fixed upon any other Patron than your Ho∣nour, the living Image of him∣self: That large Stock of Re∣putation which his great Merits and Abilities have purchased, is by your Imitation of his Vertues be∣come your own: And to you only, all that was his, is justly due: And this imboldens me the ra∣ther to Dedicate to your Honour these following Instruments of Law, which challenge your Noble Father for their Author, being all Composed by his Advice and Direction.

As for my self, I account it no mean satisfacti∣on, that the Station I was placed in as his Clerk, hath enabled me to present to the Publick View so useful a Piece, and that I have this Opportunity to express the great and humble Respect and De∣votion I bear to your Honour, to whom, and all the Branches of your Family, I wish both Tem∣poral and Eternal Happiness.

From my Chamber in Thavies Inn, June 24. 1682.
