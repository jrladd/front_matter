YOur Highnesse may iustly condemne this as a high presumption, to present the most eminent King in the Christian World with a discourse of Petitions and Coppies of Letters: but I have found favour in your sight when I presented them unto your highnesse upon more dangerous tearmes, and therefore I trust that blessed Lord will move your heart still to accept of the hearty desires of your poore subject, though they be not clothed with the glori∣ous ornaments of Wisdome and Eloquence, as was fit to dedicate to the view of so lear∣ned and judicious a Prince, but my comfort

is, I speake to a mercifull King, that knowes how to passe by infirmities, and to pardon great offences: and so beseeching the Lord God of heaven and earth to blesse your Highnesse with many happy dayes, long to raigne over us to heare the Petitions of your faithfull Subjects, and to redresse their wronges, craving pardon for my boldnesse, I humbly take my leave.
