Honoured Countrymen,
THE Discourse which had lately your Audience, now offers itsself to your View, it was composed for you, and doth by Right belong to you. The Design of it is,
 by beating down the Price of the World, to perswade you to make such a good Æ²se of it, while you live in it, that you may go out of it with comfort. GOD hath blessed many of you with ample Estates, it is your Duty to return him a Tributary Acknowledgment by a Generous Charity: That these Meditations may be serviceable for this End, is the hearty Prayer of,
Honoured Countrymen,
