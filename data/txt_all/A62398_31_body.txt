WHen fond imaginary Dreams do ring,
In formless forms in mens molested brain,
On such a time, I sleeping in my bed,
An unaccustom'd Dream came in my head,
I thought four and twenty to me came,
All Gentlemen, and Shepherds Swain,
Whereof Iames Grieve Lenup he was one,
Which I have dedicated unto your Worships hand,
You know him well to be an honest man,

And is a just and harmless Shepherd Swain,
His Fleece doth clothe the naked, that there's non deny,
His Food relieves the needy, as they pass him by;
The Orphan, Widow, and the indigent,
For Bed and Board from him have supplement,
These Shepherd Swains, as I do understand,
Relieves more poor, nor all the Lairds of the Land,
Their Butter, Cheese, their Milk, their Whey,
Their Flesh and Wool they part continually,
That I dar say, were there not such men,
Five thousand in the year would starve and pine;
God bless their Substance, that helps the poor folks Messes,
And send them store of Wool to bring them Golden Pieces.
