GENTLEMEN,
HAving need of a firm and so∣lid Prop for the weakness of my Conceptions, I shall imitate most Authors, who ordinarily choose the pro∣tection of some Person of Credit, under whose Names they publish their Works to the World: But I shall not follow the custom of many, who dedi∣cate them for the most part to persons who have no manner of knowledge of the mat∣ter of which they treat; induced thereto, rather in hopes of some mercinary recom∣pence, than any other motive. This is, Gentlemen, that which obligeth me to ad∣dress my self to you (as to those who alone are fit Judges of it) and to offer you the

first fruits of my Labours, which might run the hazard of being gnawed by the Worm of Envy, if not put into your hands to protect. I offer it to you, in acknow∣ledgment of the honour you did me, when some time since you received me into your famous Company; and to acquit my self of the Obligation I owed you: for, being a Member of your Body, all my pains ought to be for you. This is the reason why I could not present it to any other person, without being guilty of a domestick larci∣ny. By giving it you, I am liberal of your proper Goods; or rather I render you an account only of the Talent you entrusted me with to improve: I mean the true Pre∣cepts of this noble Art of Chirurgery, of which you have a knowledge and experi∣ence so perfect, that every one is obliged openly to confess, that you are alone, a∣mongst all the Chirurgeons of Europe, of whom it may be justly said, Vos Sol, alios umbra regit.
I shall refrain, Gentlemen, to praise you upon this subject; for (besides that it de∣serves a Pen more able than mine, to ac∣quit it self according to your merits) I may fear, that I should be silenced by such, as would alledge to me for so doing, that

with which he once was reproached, who undertook to praise Hercules in publishing his Heroick Actions to the People of Lace∣demonia: Who (anwered one) is he that knows him not?  th not esteem him to be in the number of the immortal Gods? So like∣wise may it be said to me; Who is he that knoweth not the Master-Chirurgeons of Paris Is it not manifest that you are that fruitful Spring, to which they come from all places of Europe to draw the per∣fection of so fair an Art? and whither many Princes and Princesses of strange Countries are obliged to have recourse for the preservation and recovery of their health, which they believe cannot be ob∣tained so easily, and with so much assurance from any other as from you? Is it not known likewise, that our puissant Monarch hath this many years entrusted wholly his Sacred Person into the hands of him, who through his merits is at present the Head of your illustrious Body? Neither can it be forgotten, that this great King did, through a fatherly goodness which he had for the preservation of all the Nobility, that ac∣companied him the last year in his Con∣quests in Flanders, command three or four of you to stanch the blood which was spilt

before that mighty City de L'Isle, which he brought under his obedience? Was it not then seen, how divers persons of great quality (who were mortally wounded in signalizing themselves at the Attaque of that strong Place) seem'd wholly reviv'd at the instant they received the news of the arrival of these excellent Chirurgeons, upon the confidence they had to receive from them a speedy and a certain help? One might at the same time likewise per∣ceive the Generosity of others extraordi∣narily augmented through the Confidence they had in their safe hands. Let us there∣fore treat no longer of that, of which none are ignorant; but rather make some few reflections on your Charity (which renders you every-where so famous) in assisting gratis with your sage and prudent Counsels an infinity of Sick, who meet from all parts at St. Come, the first Monday of every Month in the year, to consult with you upon ma∣ny Diseases, to all others (except you) incurable; despairing ever to obtain a cure for their Maladies, if it do not descend from your famous Magazine. This Cha∣rity also plainly appears in the Instruction you bestow gratis upon all Students in Chi∣rurgery, appointing some from amongst

you, to make them Demonstrations in Anatomy, and teach them the true Me∣thod how well to perform all the Opera∣tions of Chirurgery; of which Commission I have had the honour to acquit my self, as well as it was possible for me, during three years, in pursuance of the Order you gave me to that purpose: But (since in those Exercises, so ordered by you, we do not usually discourse of Women with Child, nor of their different Labours) I have thought, that, to discharge my self intirely of my duty, you will not judge a∣miss, my publishing this Book to the world, which I present you; in which I endeavour to demonstrate exactly the means of re∣medying many Indispositions of Women with Child and in Childbed, with an exact Method of well-practising the Art of Mid∣wifery, being perswaded that it may be very profitable to many young Chirurge∣ons, who live in the Country, where but very few sufficiently instructed in all things necessary to be known, can be met with; I have also the rather undertaken this, that the Midwives may finde in it that which they ought to know, to enable them the better to exercise their Ar, and under∣go

the Examination, which at present they are obliged to before you for their Recep∣tion: I hope likewise (Gentlemen) you will have the goodness to excuse it, though it hath not so fair a form as the matter requires, and though I do not express the contents so perfectly as you conceive them; for I have (I confess with a little too much confidence) undertaken to open divers secrets of Nature, which (being very abstruse, and as difficult to be com∣prehended) create yet incomparably more trouble to explain them significantly, to be well understood: notwithstanding, as it is often seen, that a dark body reflects the light which it receives; so likewise I hope, that this small Work may (by the reflection of the Sun of your Doctrine, of which I have received many rayes) en∣lighten the young Chirurgeons and Mid∣wives in the difficulties which they often meet with at Labours.
Accept then (Gentlemen) this small Production of one of your Children, who conjures you, by the love of Fathers, (that never disown their Children, how deformed soever) to defend it against En∣vy

and Detraction, which will never dare to attaque it, when you have vouch∣safed it your Protection; which is the Favour desired from you by
(Gentlemen)
