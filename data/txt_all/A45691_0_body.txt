IT was the saying of David, Psal. 112.6. The Righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. And of Solomon, Prov. 10.7. The memoriall of the Just shall be blessed. Divine Providence made it my Lot to heare this ensuing Sermon pathetically
delivered by that Pious divine Dr. Harrison, in a ful and fluent manner; ex∣tracting Tears from the Eyes, and Sighs from the Hearts, of the Hearers.
