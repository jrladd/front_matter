SIR,
HAd not the subject of this following dis∣course,
been the discovery of the most
acute and curious Genius of this age,
the Virtuosi of the Royal Societies of
London and Paris, and the quality I bear, of your
Majesties servant, given me some title to your Majesties
Protection, I durst not have presum'd to front such a
bagatelle as this, with an Adress to the mightiest Monarch

in Europe; But a Cherry or Rose preventing the ordinary
seasons of the maturity of the rest; by their rare singularity
are rendred acceptable to Princes, not for their own real value
(which is none) but novelty, which challenges their acceptance.
And Sir, the Experiments of Healing by Transfusion of
Blood, are both New and Curious, and I hope these Reflections
may cast some Radiatiations of light upon the obscure and
devious paces of Nature, such as may perhaps discover some
of her more hidden recesses, especially in her regiment of Hu∣mane
Bodies. I have (as far as was possible) avoided hard
and obscure words, but having taken upon me to inquire into
the reasons, and examine the admirable success of these late
Experiments, by the Test of Hermetick Phylosophy, it was not
possible for me to avoid such Terms as this Art necessarily re∣quires
to render it intelligible; though (if I mistake not) this
method gratifies the understanding with far more evident and
apparent reason than that of the Peripateticks, commonly re∣ceiv'd
in the Schools; I need not labour to perswade Your
Majestie into a good opinion of the noble Science of Chymistry,
which solely possesses all the keyes of the three Kingdomes
of Nature, the natural propensity of Your Royal Genius, strongly

inclines You to the love of all Learning, but more particularly
of this, the most worthy perhaps of all humane Sciences, such as
that antiently amongst the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Arabians,
&c. Many of their Kings have gloried more in the knowledge of
this Art, than in the lustre of their Diadems, such were Hermes,
Tresmegistus, Morienus, Calib, Alphonso King of Por∣tugal,
&c. and although the ignorance and Thrasonick boast∣ing
of Pseudochymists, have almost brought it into contempt in
this Age, yet it is a most undoubted truth, That Paracelsus,
Van Helmont, and many others, have been able to conquer all
Diseases Gallenical Physitians now call incurable, and that
with great facility; in effect, true Philosophers have not only
had Ʋniversal Medicines for Humane, but Metallick bodies
also, insomuch that the Chrysopaean Art is said so to have
flourished in Egypt, about the year 294. that the mighty
Emperor Dioclesian could never conquer that people by force,
till he had by Stratagem in time of peace possest himself of the
Books, together with the Artificers, and by that means sub∣jected
them to his Empire. But Mr. Denis's Letter gives me
onely opportunity at present to expose some few Physical observa∣tions,
tending to health and prolongation of life, both which,

with excess of all humane felicity, may the King of Kings by
the guidance of his inviolable providence, inseparably annex
to your Majesties Crown and Sacred Person.
