Right Honorable,
THe Glories of your
Name, make me
ambitious to give
you a testimony of my duty &
observance. There be some
whose vain-glory prompts
them to think they by Dedi∣cations

honor their Patrons,
but the whole world will
judge me free from such va∣nity,
when they shall perceive
I have made my addresses to
a Person, who besides his
height of Nobility, is arrived
at such a sublimity of Worth,
Vertue, and Learning, that
not onely the greatest Wits of
the Age are bound to honor
him; but must confess they
receive their splendor and lu∣stre
from him.
Yet thus (my Lord) I make
my self guilty of an almost in∣excusable
presumption: the
wisest of men may as well pre∣sent

somewhat worthy a De∣ity,
as I any thing which may
deserve your LORDSHIPS
thoughts. It is not fit a Pigmy
should call down a IOVE to
protect him; but where there
is so much worth, there must
needs be an insuperable good∣ness;
nor can he be justly bla∣med
who onely aspires at the
influence of a benevolent Star.
I want the confidence to be∣seech
your Lordship to ap∣prove
this VVork, the honor
will be sufficient if you accept
it, as a pledge of that obser∣vance
which all men are bound
to pay you. I know your

Lordship not only to be vers't
in all History, but (to your
glory be it spoken) to have
always studied the most wor∣thy
Authors. And History is
indeed a Treasure not onely
enriching mens mindes with
noble thoughts, but enanima∣ting
them to great and Hero∣ick
Actions.
Your Lordships endeavors
to make an Alliance between
the two Renowned Crowns
of England and Portugal, may
justly claim all that can be
said of that Kingdom, as a
due Offering. This, though
but a Breviate of the Story

of it, may perchance contain
somewhat, though not at all
worthy your Lordship, yet
not wholly unworthy observa∣tion,
which I hope may per∣swade
your Generosity and
goodness to grantit protection.
England, my Lord, and
every member of it, are be∣holding
to your Lordships
great wisdom; but should I
undertake to praise all those
noble Vertues for which you
deserve their loves, that Ju∣stice
which ballances all your
actions; that Prudence which
a whole Nation hath admi∣red;
that Magnanimity which

hath rendred you unalterable
in all the frowns and smiles
of Fortune; that Liberality
which hath made you King∣like,
and that Temperance
which shown in the height
of Heavens, and Heavens-Vice-gerents
favours, hath
made you God-like, I should
be enforced to unite the lar∣gest
Encomiums, and lay
them down as a due tribute,
at the feet of your thrice-re∣nowned
Fame.
But (my Lord) I dare one∣ly
reverence your Vertues,
they must rather be the sub∣ject
of my admiration than de∣scription.

Let it suffice then,
that whilst all strive to offer
up their labors to this Shrine,
it will be sufficient excuse of
my ambition to present this
Mite, and amongst the num∣bers
that thus sacrifice to your
Worth, to be thought wor∣thy
of that honorable Stile of
being esteemed the meanest
of
