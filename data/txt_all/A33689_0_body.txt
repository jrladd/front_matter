MY LORD,
HAD not this conjuncture of time put con∣fidence in me, I durst never have ventur'd either the publishing of these unpolish't rimes, or pre∣fixing your Honourable name to the front of them.

For, having ever held Poëtry (however a dar∣ling, I must confess, of my inclination) to be but an excusable trifling of precious time, measur'd to mankind by the Inch or narrowness of a Span, though his thoughts and active part grasp the whole series of Ages and flie at Eternity, and his task seems to be the reading here below of that great book of Nature, whereof near six thousand years expir'd have taught to the most reaching Genius'es but the A B. C. of it, with no other success then to multiply contentions and debates: having, I say, put no other esteeme upon the Art of making verses, (although it has had its admirers and followers in all ages) then of a lawful and harmless diversion, and unbending of the mind when it has spent and ex∣hausted itself upon severer studies, and more se∣rious imployments; I could not have avoided by presenting these to your patronage, and inviting you to stoop to the light entertainment of Poetry, the just censure and imputation of undervaluing your se∣rious leasure, more usefully imployed in those publick thoughts wherein your High relations at Court, and your Noble zeal of serving your Prince and Country, in that Great Senate which coynes the Laws of this Nation, do at present ingage you. But that, be∣ides the love and esteem I have observ'd (having

the honour to be sometimes in your Lordships com∣pany) you have for the Muses, and your capacity of judging right of the delicacies of the French verse, which every ear and palate are not capable of; the Parliaments recess, and your Lordships journey for Ireland being now at hand, do furnish me with an unquestionable plea for the publishing and ad∣dress to your Lordship of this Poetical Rapsody and Essay in several languages, whereof your Lordship is equally a competent judge. To make this good, I need not borrow records of antiquity, nor quote Ennius, always taken by that incompa∣rable Roman Scipio for a companion in all his journeys; or Homer's Poems cherished and read by Alexander in all his expeditions; Virgil and Ho∣race entertained by Augustus and Mecaenas; as the lawfullest diversion they could pitch upon, when they would unbind and give a refreshment to their vast and undefatigable Minds, on which did turn the hinges and relyed the weight of most part of the then habitable World.
This is well known to your Lordship; as also how much on the same account Ronsard was esteemed by Charles the ninth of France; and this, My Lord, gives me the confidence, that (though nothing you can read here, bears proportion with

the excellent productions of those Primitive He∣ros's of the Art,) yet some thing may have the good luck to please and to divert your Lordship, were it but the matter this Rapsody affords, and those Ideas it may raise in your mind of the best of Princes, restoring the hopes of these Na∣tions (wherein you have so large a share) to the greatest happiness they ever could enjoy. I might have had good opportunity to relate here amongst one of the great causes of it, those faithful and unwearied endeavors, and great services of your Honoura∣ble Family, which are sufficient pledges and se∣curities themselves of perpetuating the Illustrious Name of ORMOND to future ages, to make it as lasting as the BRITISH MONARCHY, and equal in duration to the Sun and Moon.
But that being to vast a Sea too engage in with a slender skull, and too waighty a subiect to venture upon unpreparedly, I have not dared to presume, My Lord, to touch it with a slight hand, or crowde any part of it in a preliminary Epistle a custome to much countenanc'd by most of our Modern Wri∣ters. The height of my ambition, and utmost scope of my desseine at present, My Lord, is onely (since I have no other means left to provide for my attendance upon your Lordship, and the Heads

of your Honourable Family in this your journey) that you will be pleas'd to accept of me in this slen∣der garbe, being every may otherwise disap∣pointed by the frowns of Fortune, and so unfit to pretend admittance in so splendid a train, un∣less it be
Nella scorta di Phebo, ch' à voi s'inchina,
Tutta ridente, tutta di scherzi piena.
But, My Lord, to borrow my own words written on another accasion,
—Si quelque jour, la Fortune
Met en plus grande liberté
Mon Genie persecuté
Des rigueurs de cette importune;
Peut estre d'un burin plus seur,
Et d'un vers rempli de douceur,
D'ORMOND j'entreprendray l'image;
Et dans les beaux exploits de tous ses Descēdās
La depeindray si bien, que la plus fiere rage
Respectera ses traits jusqu'a la fin des temps.
This is the vow, this is the serious wish of him, My Lord, who desires for no better end to be once again

restored to the state of his former Fortune, then to become thereby more ready and capable to wait hereafter on your Lordship otherwise then by his Pen, and to declare by some more real deed then Poëtical expressions, how unfainedly he is
MY LORD,
