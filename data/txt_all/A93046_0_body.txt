SIR,
IT is a saying in the Civil Law, That a thing which is any Mans own, cannot be made more his by any new Act or Deed: The consequence of which, is, that the De∣dication of this Piece to you will be meer∣ly nugatory, since by all right it is already yours. For it is not long since I imagined no more being either Author, or Compiler of any matter on this subject, then of doing any other thing which I have neither fancy nor fitness to. But you were pleased to judge me able, and (which obliged me to this task) to propose it unto me as your de∣sire
that I should make an essay of that abili∣ty, in writing somewhat even on this subject, that might be of Philosophical and common use. To have questioned your judgement herein, might have stained me with too much arrogance, and to have been care∣lesse of your pleasure, with unworthiness and want of good Manners. Remembring therefore those respects I owe to Honor, Learning, and such persons as study its ad∣vancement and promotion, I could not de∣ny this poor endeavor, the product of which arising originally from your own act, I thought fit should be delivered over to your pleasure, since to you, as its primary cause (which is its prime commendation) it ought to belong.
And Sir, If it may not be troublesome unto you to receive some brief account of this action, and the Fortunes which happen∣ed to me in pursuance of your satisfaction therein, you will give me leave to acquaint you, that it having been your Honors express desire, that this Piece might extend as far, and be as comprehensive and full, as my present Experience, Knowledge, and Recol∣lection of the matter of Vegetable Propaga∣tion should permit: I gave my self the trou∣ble to run over with my eye, all Books I could precure of these subjects, not intend∣ing to trust any, but thereby to be put in mind
of the particulars, concerning which, I had no reason to have a Register ready in my head. Here first my fortune was to finde a multitude of monstrous untruths, and pro∣digies of lies, in both Latine and English old and new Writers, worse in their kinde then the stories in Sir Iohn Mandevel's Travels, or in the History of Fryer Bacon and his Man Miles; or else what may be more ridicu∣lously removed not onely from truth, but from any semblance thereof. And which moved me most at this very season, when we esteemed the World to be now awaked, I found in the Shops Authors newly set forth (I hope against their own wills) who se∣riously professed to have made a select choice of Experiments of this nature, and to report nothing, but what from observation and experience they have certainly found true, yet deserving not to have the credit of Wecker and Porta, Professions in such Papers, which seem to me at no time pro∣per, but when the persons credits, together with their Books, are joyntly to be set to sale. You easily believe that I am not free to follow these Examples, for then, first, I must abuse your Noble Name, by inscribing it to a most unworthy Discourse, and then (which is too common a fault) traduce as many Readers, as ignorance and simple∣ness
of nature hath made credulous.
But as to those Authors, in whose relati∣ons I found any thing of truth, I have done them this right, That where ever I could re∣late an Operation or Experiment in their words, with truth and fitness, I spared to coyn new (desiring to supplant no Author in his credit, nor to purloyn his reputation) though I had learned the truth of the same thing from the testimony of my eyes: Ha∣ving indeed some quarrel at the fashion of ordinary Writers, who study in nothing to benefit Learning, but by giving new words to old matter.
I have left out none of the Heads pro∣posed in the Catalogue, which I presented you with, a year since, except the last, which you desired might shew the methods and ways of keeping useful Vegetables without putrefaction, and the preparing them with their several parts and products for humane use. This at present I thought necessary to forbear, for I found the matter too much for one Chapter, and my leisure too little to make a Book thereon: nor durst I esteem my Observations such, as might en∣able me to write an adequate Treatise on that subject, which reaches in compass the largest, and as I firmly believe (however the Animal and Mineral Kingdom abound with
great and potent Medicines) not the worst. Part of the Pharmacopoea, and many parti∣culars beyond; but rather think fit to em∣ploy my self some more years in the Expe∣rience and Practice of Preparations, and take the pains of collecting and trying such intelligible and probable processes as shall come to my hand, either reported hereto∣fore, or used now, especially in our Nation, for fitting matters to Alimental, Medical, and Mechanical use, before I shall imagine to have the least hand in that History, which may as well be learn'd by such as are con∣cern'd to know it, from Modern Dispensa∣tories, and other novel Writers. But the perfection of that History, with correction of processes capable of amendment, is, in my estimation, a design and work worthy of the Care, Patronage, and Governance, and fit to be carryed on by the interest, if too tedious, for the Pen and Pains of your Honor.
As to the form and composure of matter under those Heads, I must make it a parti∣cular business to beg your pardon; for I finde it even in my own judgement exceed∣ing rude, and it could be no otherwise, when the Revise of the Press, was, for a great part, the first review made of my own Writing; and indeed, the whole piece in
every part seems destitute of beauty, and without any thing of great worth, value, or nobleness. For I finde, that the opera∣tions themselves, and other matters that do belong to the subject in hand, and so capa∣ble to come under this History, are for the most part common, and devoid of curiosi∣ty: Nor durst I embellish their plainness with Stories taken from our Learned and Profound Writers of Natural Magick, be∣cause I intended, as no very imperfect, so likewise a true Inventary of what the pow∣er of man, at this present time, on this sub∣ject, is, with the Co-operation of Nature, able to produce: For these reasons, and perchance because of another piece then un∣der my hand, to which I had more propense affections. I was exercised in this writing, not without some reluctancy and untoward∣ness of minde; and it surely had proved to me a piece of meer drudgery, had not the hope of giving you satisfaction, and making this a testimony of my obeysance and hum∣ble submission to your Judgement and de∣sires inspirited me, and let a lightsomness into my thoughts. What I have written, I shall not commend, by any Prefaces, to any Reader, though I shall give him here some things new, and of my proper Observation: I know that many, by their own Interest
and (that great power) Temporal Profit, will be tempted to give it the reading. Nei∣ther shall I, in imitation of some Modern Alchymists, for ostentation, bid them goe; and by the improvement (which I hope may be some to most Readers) be charitable to the poor: Hoping, that for Gods sake, they will rather (as they are bound by Obligati∣ons infinitely more high) be thereto moved; nor need I excuse my self to them for any deficiency in this Writing, you having in∣gaged your self to be the Proprieter there∣of, and by your acceptance of this poor Piece, greatly obliging,
SIR,
