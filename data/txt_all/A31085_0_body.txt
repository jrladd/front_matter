My LORD,
I Take the boldness to present your Lord∣ship with some of the First-fruits of my de∣ceased Son's Studies in Divinity. And since it hath pleased God, to my unspeakable grief and loss, to deprive me of so great a blessing, and comfort of my old age; it is no small mi∣tigation of my sorrow, that whilst he liv'd, he was not unprofitable to the world, and that now he is dead, he hath left those mo∣numents of his piety and learning behind him, which I am told are generally thought not unworthy to be imparted to the publick.
If these Sermons be such, I have no cause

to doubt but they will easily obtain your Lord∣ship's Patronage, who are so known a Favou∣rer of all that is vertuous and worthy, espe∣cially of Religion and the Ministers of it. Of which I had particular experience upon the death of my good Son, when your Lordship was pleased, with so much humanity and con∣descension, to send to comfort me under that sad loss, and to express your own resentment of it.
But what-ever these Sermons be, since I have no other way to acknowledge my great obligations to your Lordship upon all occasi∣ons, I hope your Lordship will please favou∣rably to accept of this, how small soever, yet sincere testimony of my dutifull respects and gratitude. I am,
My LORD,
