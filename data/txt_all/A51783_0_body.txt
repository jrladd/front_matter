AMongst the pious acknowledgements, which have been lately paid to the Memory of our late Queen, This comes, tho' less deserving, to crave your Lordships Patronage. The true concern of its Author, will, I hope, in some sort excuse the errors of the Poem. 'Tis Pastoral, my Lord: A kind of Verse, us'd amongst Shepherds in old time, that admits of nothing affected, or disagreeing to the purest Innocence, such as was practised in the Golden Age. I pre∣sume not hereby to inform your Lordship of the Nature of Pastorals, but to vindicate that Verse from the ill opinions of some, who, me∣thinks, by disapproving of it, must be no Friends to Virtue and In∣nocence. But least I prove troublesome to your Lordship, whose Hours are of infinite Value and Importance, I humbly begg your Lordships acceptance of this Essay, and the Honour to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
