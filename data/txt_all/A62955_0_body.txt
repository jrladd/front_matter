Worthy SIR,
SInce no man, be he never so great a stranger to your Per∣son, can be unacquainted with your Virtues & good∣ness, so well known to your Country, and particularly
your own Borough, (whose Inhabitants are ready at all times to throw them∣selves at your feet in thank∣full acknowledgment of your many favours) among these, Sir, (now Provi∣dence hath made me one of of them) may this my Mite of gratuity be accepted of.
I thought these Tracts not improper for such a Patron, both in respect of their style and subject: The Style being poor, may yet, Sir, we know travel abroad
with courage & safety un∣der Your Protection. The Subject indeed High, our Solemn Festivals, were at the same time with you re∣stored to their due splendor. And I have this to say, the plainer these Compendious discourses, the more suita∣ble to their Auditory, being the substance only of what was delivered to my own charge: Nor ought these Truths any more (then some our more solid Gentry now adayes) be the lesse e∣steemed
of, for their ordinary garbe. Wherein, what I have bor∣rowed, I have chosen ra∣ther to bee too troublesome, with Interlinings, then not honest, to repay again, in the exact quotation of the Authors: I would have no man for me such a Dia∣goras, as in pett to turn Atheist, finding me not thunder-struck for wrong∣fully fathering anothers labour. To Conclude, Sir, If these my Honest, (though weak endeavours) prove
any way profitable, with your pardon, and good lik∣ing; I have my wish, whose cheifest ambition is to beg leave, to subscribe,
SIR,
