SO small (right excellent & most vertuous Queen) is the talent of my lear∣ning, that, notwithstan∣ding, I haue not willing∣lye conceiled it, it hath beene deseruedlye vnre∣garded: which helde my willing minde, all amazed, at my first aduenture into this my truely affected purpose: Yet duely, and dutifully considering, that he that sayde vn∣to Dauid, Aperi os tuum & implebo illud, was all sufficient to direct mee: and who sayde vnto Paule, Meafortitudo in imbecillitate perficitur, both could and would assist me, I founde no cause of doubt: but feeling further instigatiō, I proceded

And, this (most gratious princesse) is the effect of my poore trauaile, which beeing thus simply performed, true affection mooued me and the daylie experience of your Maiesties clemencie, resolued mee, this daye (though trembling) to make it a messenger of my loyaltie: although in value, lesse then the poore widowes mite, and therefore farre vnaunswerable, to your princely worthinesse: yet in true zeale not inferiour to a most precious present. It may please your Ma∣iesty, graciously to accept it (so were I happy) but through the weakenesse of my abilitie, I can not but reuerently acknowledge, that, might it bee accepted, at your princely handes, with bening patience, it is not in respect of my deseruinges, but proceeding onelye, and altogeather, of your Maiesties wonted clemencye. The experience whereof, hath engrauen in the heartes of your truely affected subiectes, suche a perfect print of free presumption, of your gratious acceptaunce, euen of a cup of colde water, flowinge from the fountaine, of their loyall obedience: that I no∣thing dispayre of that, which your royall heart hath so generally afforded to many.
Among whome, although I bee the most vn∣worthy, the causes mouing my willing minde, to wade hereinto (time and occasions considered) were not vnreasonable: tending (moste godly princesse) to the comfort of the little stocke of true Christians, that in these dangerous dayes, they yeeld not vnto the course, nor be dismayed

at the threats of the multitude: a monster com∣pact of many daungerous members, domesticall and foraine: protesting, that the rashe and pe∣rilous resolution, which is to bee noted in the multitude in these dayes, without regarde of the truth, gaue greatest inforcement, to my tra∣uaile: which (in respect that therein, the multi∣tude may see their errour, and weaknesse) I haue intituled it, A mirror for the multitude, and in all humilitie sheilded the same, vnder the protec∣tion of your Maiesty: a patronesse most pure and perfect: nothing doubting, but it may please th great Sheepheard (euen in the time of your royal raigne) to gather all his children into one folde▪ and with the swoord of his truth, to driue away all beastes, and wolues, and all kinde of sauage creatures, as traitours, and such like cruell mon∣sters, with their multitudes, and mightie adhe∣rents, from touching as much as the hemme, of your Maiesties garment, to the indaungering of your royall person, being so armed, with the vn∣doubted shield of faith in him, that first (beyond some expectation) placed your highnesse in the imperiall seat, who sheweth himselfe both al suf∣ficient, mindfull, and willing, to protect you, and with the ballance of his iustice, to trye the light∣nesse of some, that before they be duely peazed, seeme substantial, and trustie: Magna enim est ve∣ritas & preualet: Euen the aduersaries of Gods truth, to the terrour of their owne consciences: and the truely affected, to the comfort of their

hearts, consider the effect of grace, in your ma∣iesties proceedinges, and that it is decreed by the highest Iudge, to vse your Maiesty, as his in∣strument, to cut off the aspiringe heade, and to breake the greedy iawes of that fierce Holopher∣nes of Rome: and to turne the swoordes of all his blouddy complices (bent againste your Ma∣iesty, and al true Christians) into their owne bo∣wels, That the remembrance of them may perish, with the sound of their own deserued shame, and their name be wyped away for euer and euer: No true Christian doubteth it. Manye are the vnfeyned prayers (most godly Queene) that not a few true Chri∣stians, your faithful and obedient subiects, con∣tinually make, for the preseruation of your ma∣iesty, and confusion, or conuersion of these wic∣ked men: that as they haue these twentye and eight yeares so (were it to Gods glory, and your comfort, as many quadrebled) they and their posteritie, maye vnder your sacred gouerne∣ment, suck the sweet of the sauing truth, without feare of recaptiuitie in Romish Babylon.
