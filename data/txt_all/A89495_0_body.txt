Madam,
IT is but just, this little Treatise should be par∣ticularly address'd to you, since I am to ac∣knowledge, that the pub∣lishing of it, at this time, is, partly, an effect of that en∣couragement, which you sometime gave me to do it. The GROVE, into which I invite you, is the same you thought pleasant, even upon the first view of it. In one respect, it is indeed but a little one, as consisting, in all,
but of Eight Trees; but when you shall consider them, representing to you the Eight great Lessons of Christian Resignation, and those a∣gain exemplifi'd upon that Tree, whereon the great Work of Man's Redemption receiv'd its period, you will haply think it a place, where though you retire into it every day, you may find new and fresh delights, which you may so improve here, as to attain eternal ones hereafter.
I know, Madam, how con∣stant a practiser you are of the Virtues here recommended to you, and to what a height of pious exercises you are ar∣riv'd
thereby; and conse∣quently, that your Appre∣hensions of Sacred Mysteries need not the assistances of vi∣sible Objects, so much as those of some others may, who, moving in a lower Sphear, derive from what they see, a deeper and more lively reflection on what they do not. If these Endeavours of mine may have an influence onely on these latter; if these Em∣blematical Representations be of some benefit and advant∣tage to any, though the least of God's Servants: I shall nei∣ther think them mis-bestow'd, nor be asham'd of their mean∣ness; since what is done tends
to the Acquisition of future BEATITUDE, the End, in order to which, we have our present Being. That Bea∣tifical State ought to be the Object of our Thoughts, Wishes, Words, and Actions; How much I wish it to all, let this little Work; how particu∣rarly to your self, Madam, let the addressing of it to you, be my Witness: with this fur∣ther assurance, that I am,
