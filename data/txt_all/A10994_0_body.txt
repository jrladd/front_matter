RIght Honourable, Preaching, and Printing of Sermons, if both be done for the glory of God, and the good of his Church, are like the Two siluer Trumpets of the Tabernacle, excellent instruments to call men to Christ, but if in Printing and Preaching, Diuines seeke their owne glory, and thirst after popular applause, then they be but Trumpets of Rams-hornes, whose sound leuels not the walles of Iericho, but Hierusalem with the ground: I dare not auowe that these my labours, Preached and Printed, be Trumpets of Siluer, for then should I paralele the proud Pharasie in iustifying my selfe; neither will I acknowledge them to be of horne, for so should I wilfully brand mine owne acti∣ons with shame, and carie Caines marke euer vpon me; let the censure be referred to him, who is the searcher of the reines, and whose all-seeing eie hath ouer-lookt the ayme and inten∣tion of my heart, vpon which this Nil vltrà is grauen; Deo & Ecclesiae; For God and his Church; This God by One starre conducted the wise men from the East, when they came to worship the starre of Iacob, and offer their Gold, Incense, and Myrrhe to our King, Priest, and Prophet Christ: but he hath directed me to your Lordships presence by Two starres fixt by his gracious goodnesse in the firmament of your noble heart, Vertue and Honour; there to make an oblation, not of Myrrhe, Incense, and Gold, but of one slender talent, and Two poore Mites, Three worthlesse Sermons, preached as

once our Sauiour did in a Ship royall, but written out for the presse, as Ionah praied in the Whales belly; I know that the Magi of our Church doe daily cast out of their aboundance, Rich offerings into your Treasurie, to whose writings I may iustly apply that of the Poet, and call them
.
The Garden and Table of Alcinous, so well fraught and fur∣nisht they be with Knowledge, Iudgement, Wit, and Elegan∣cie; but the poore Widow must do as she may, not as she would: They that cannot bring Gold and Pearles to the building of the Tabernacle, must present a Rams-skin and Goates-haire; All the Patriarches wore not Party-coloured Coates; and all the Seruants had not fiue Talents; They then that haue but one Talent in their Purse, and one Coate to their backe, must measure their actions by their ability, euen as God himselfe by ballance doth distribute his Graces; Yet many things in themselues of no moment, are highly priced, because of their dedication to the Temples (saith Plinie.) The two Ta∣bles being but of stone, were reuerently regarded, because in them the finger of God writ the Law; nay, the very Besomes and Ash-pannes of the Temple were much esteemed, because they were instruments in the Lords house; so I hope these my Endeuours shall purchase the better Respect in the opinion of the Readers, for that they were, and are dedicated to the de∣uout eare of his Sacred Maiestie, the inuincible defender of the faith, and to the Iudicious eie of your honourable selfe, being a bountifull Nurcing-father of our Church; which if it shall please you out of your True worth fauourably to Accept, Patronise and Protect, I will boldly promise to second them with a better Present. And thus as most bounden in duty, readie in seruice, and daily in Praier, vnto Almighty God, to be your Honours guide and fortresse both in this life and the life to come, I rest most humble at your Honors commaund,
