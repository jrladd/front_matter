May it please Your Grace,
YOur Grace has so Nobly Patronized this Undertaking, that I should rob you of your due, if I should not hum∣bly lay this Play at your feet, since by your great and generous encou∣ragement of it, you have made that and the Author eternally your own. But had I never received any Obligation, by my particular Inclination I am bound to your Grace, since I am the most humble admirer of your Heroick Vertues, who by your early

and unimitable Example, and by your eminent Com∣mand, are the greatest Patron of Arms; and by your Government of the most famous of Universities, are become the greatest Protector of Arts: of that Uni∣versity, which I can never mention without reverence; and from which I have yet another Tie to your Grace, since I had once the honour to be a Member of that Illustrious Society, which though it be the most Learn∣ed in the World, can boast of no greater Honour then that of being commanded by so Excellent a Prince; one who is equally Valiant against his Enemies, and Courteous to his Friends; whose boundless Courage is always ready to vanquish the one, and whose Prince∣ly Generosity is always ready to oblige the other.
I shall not here recite those Heroick Actions, which all Europe have celebrated, and none have equall'd: Those are too Great for an Epistle Dedicatory, and onely fit for solid, lasting History; which certainly must do your Grace that right, to Enrol you in the fore∣most Rank of Fame. Nor can we doubt, but the me∣mory of your Grace's Actions will last, when Time shall have devoured the Places where they were per∣formed: When Mastrick shall be a heap of Rubbish, and the name might otherwise be swallow'd in the Ruine, it will be remembred by the greatest Action in the World, done there by the Greatest and the Earliest Hero, and by one, who for all his fierceness of Courage, has yet that Gentleness to Mankind, that he thinks that day lost, in which he does not oblige. One who is not onely infinitely bless'd in the most excellent Partner

of his Joys and Cares, happy above measure in the Goods of Mind, the Perfections of Body, and the greatest Splendour and Ornaments of Fortune, but he enjoys all these unenvied; nay, is not onely free from every mans envy, but has his love.
I should be afraid of this boldness, in once mention∣ing things so much above my Pen, were I not assured of your Grace's Generosity, that enclines you to par∣don, even a well-intended Errour, in your humble Creature, who begs Protection from you, and needs it too.
I have, by my misfortune, not my fault, met with some Enemies, who are always ready to do me the ir∣reparable injury, to blast my Reputation with the King; and when I have the Honour to please Him, (which is of all things in the world my greatest Am∣bition) endeavour to perswade him, that I do not write the Plays I own, or at least, that the best part of them are written for me; which is so malitious an aspersion, that I am sure they themselves believe it not, and they may as well accuse me of firing the City. I am sure (though I may want Wit to write a Play) I have more ho∣nesty then to own what another man writes. But I am not yet so poor as to borrow; if I should, I should find not many that are rich enough to lend, Wit being much a scarcer Commodity then Money, I am sure with some who have reported this of me; who what ever they have of of one, have scarce enough of the other to supply their own necessities; and therefore I should be but very slenderly furnished from them.

I can never enough acknowledge the Honour done me by your incomparable Durchess, in endeavouring to clear me of this Aspersion: And who would not be proud of being aspersed, to be so vindicated? From this and some other injuries of my Enemies, I humbly beg your Grace's protection, who, I am sure, have Good∣ness and Greatness enough to defend me against them: And I had rather owe it to your Grace, then to any man: For no man is more then I,
