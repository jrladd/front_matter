BEtwixt two Roses, I a Lilly place,
Three flowers most sweet, and louely flourishing,
All hopefull, by Gods blessing and his grace,
In Vertues Garden sweetly vp to spring;
A true and worthy Gardiner they haue
From choaking weedes, them to preserue and saue.


God was assistant to so wise Elector,
When first he chose so sure a friend indeed
To be his childrens Gardian and Protector,
Who with an honourable care, and heed,
Kindly respects his deare posteritie,
Which sure shall lift his honour to the skie.



To you sole Sonne vnto this worthy Knight,
I likewise dedicate my simple Muse,
Conioyning you together, as tis right,
Because a Simpathie in loue you vse:
As you are Fellowes both at Schoole and play,
(I hope) I blamelesse ioyne you partners may.


And thus relying on your kind affection,
That courteously you will this booke receiue,
I boldly shroud it vnder your protection:
And here in briefe I humbly take my leaue,
Wishing your vertues to grow more and more
In multitudes, like Sand vpon the shore.
