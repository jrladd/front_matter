My LORD, May it please your Grace,
I Dare not call this Ad∣dress Presumption, the usual Compliment men give to Persons of Honour in Dedicati∣ons of Books, but Du∣ly, and the greatest Service, I can pay you, It's the cause of God, and the

cause of Mens immortal Souls, I am defending in this Treatise, a Subject, which claims attention from all degrees of men, and wherein the most puissant Prince is as much concern'd, as the meanest Vassal. It is a future estate, and what becomes of men, when their bodies do drop from them, and what they must do to inherit that eternal glory, which a merciful God hath been pleas'd to pro∣mise them, that I intend to speak to; and if there be such a thing, as a retribution after Death, and our Souls, When they leave their earthly Tabernacles, must come to an after-reckoning, and appear before the dreadful Tribunal of a just and infinite Majesty, certainly that man is unjust to himself, and an enemy to his own preservation, that dares neglect his preparation for that great, and tremen∣dous Audit, and prefers not meditation on that last account before all the sensual enjoyments of this World.
My LORD, We are fall'n into an Age, wherein some few daring men (in∣deed their number is inconsiderable, com∣pared with the more sober part of Man∣kind) have presumed to mock at a pu∣nishment after death, and term'd that a Bugbear, deriv'd from the tales of Priests, and the melancholy of contem∣plative men, which the wiser World here∣tofore was afraid to entertain, but with most serious reflections. When the ripest and most subact judgments for almost six thousand years together, by the instinct of Nature, and Conscience, have believ'd a future Retribution, it's pretty, to see a few raw Youths, who have drown'd their Reason in Sensuality, and scarcely ever perus'd any Books, but Romances, and the lascivious Rhapsodies of Poets, assume to themselves a power to controul the uni∣versal sense, and consent of Mankind; think themselves wiser, than all the grave Sages, that have liv'd before them; and break Jests in their Riots and Debau∣chery's,

upon that, which not only Christi∣ans, but Jews, Mahometans, and Hea∣thens, the subtilest, and most knowing of them, have ever since we have any Re∣cord or History of their Actions, and Be∣lief, profess'd, and embrac'd with all ima∣ginable Reverence.
And are not things come to a fine pass, My LORD, when Christianity, the clearest Revelation that was ever vouch∣saf'd to men, hath been receiv'd, con∣firm'd, and approv'd of in the World above sixteen hundred years, and the greatest Philosophers in many of those Countries, where it hath taken Root, have not dared to doubt of the truth of it, the convincing power that came along with it, proclaiming its Divinity and Majesty, that these bold Attentates should now be∣gin to arraign its Authority, and put us upon proving the first Principles of it, as if the World were return'd to its for∣mer Barbarism, and we had once more to do with Infidels, as if men had divested

themselves of Humanity, put on the na∣ture of Beasts, and were sent into the World to understand no more, but the matter, and motion of the Malmsbury Philosophy.
I confess I have sometimes blamed my self for accusing these Libertines of Athe∣ism, when I have understood, what mortal Enemies they were to Lying, and Non∣sence; for how should not they believe a God, that cannot speak a sentence, but must swear by him, or the truth of the Christian Religion, that put so remark∣able an Emphasis upon 's Wounds, and Blood; or another World, that do so often imprecate Damnation to them∣selves, or the being of a Devil, who do not seldom wish, he may confound them? Would not any man conclude, That Per∣sons who do so exclaim against every mistaken, and misplaced word, and are such perfect Masters of Sence, and value themselves so much upon their Veracity, must needs believe the existence of those

things, they make use of in their ingeni∣ous Oaths and Curses, the pompous Orna∣ments which in this Licentious Age set off the Glory, Wit, and Gallantry of such accomplish'd Pretenders? But though we must not be so unmannerly, as to ac∣cuse these Wits of contradictions in their discourses, yet any man that doth not love darkness better than light, may soon perceive how faulty this way these Scepticks are; there being nothing more common with them, than to smile at the Notion of that God, by whom they swore but just before; and to raille that day of Judgment, which they seem'd to acknow∣ledge in their absurd wishes and impre∣cations.
Some have I known, who in a serious Fit have been pleas'd to tell me, That if they could be sure, there was another World, and a Retribution for Good and Evil, none should exceed them in strict∣ness of Conversation, and exact piety of Life; and I am so charitable to believe,
that these spoke the sense of most of the rest, and that the imaginary want of cer∣tainty in this dubious Point, diverts them from venturing on that innocence and purity, which was the glory of the primi∣tive Christians. But may it not be re∣quisite to enquire, whether these Doubters have ever taken the right way to be sa∣tisfied? If one, that had never heard of such a City, as Exeter, should be told, that a Friend of his lately deceased there, had left him a Thousand pound, and he should reply, that if he were certain, there were such a City, he would repair thither, and yet would not enquire of those, that are able to inform him, might it not be presu∣med, that such an one had no mind to be satisfied? And I durst appeal to the Con∣sciences of these men, that doubt of an after-retribution, whether they did ever sincerely, and impartially desire or endea∣vor to be satisfied about it? Did they ever do, what every rational man ought to do, that is willing to be ascertained of

the truth of a common report? Did they ever put themselves to half that trouble, to be convinced of the certainty of a fu∣ture judgment, that they put themselves to, when they would know, whether the Title of the Estate, they would buy, be good or no. Do not they trudge from Lawyer to Lawyer to advise about the Evidences, that relate to it? And by this we guess, that they are willing to be sa∣tisfied.
To scoff at a Notion of weight and moment before examination, is a great sign of indiscretion and folly in those that do it, whil'st the prudent man, that de∣sires to know the truth of it, enquires what solidity there is in it, whether any wise men were ever of that opinion, what reason they had to think so, and what en∣ticed, or moved them to embrace it? he is so far from exclaiming against it at the first hearing, or arraigning those that re∣ceive it as too facile, and credulous, that he'll consult with men, whom he may ra∣tionally,

suppose to be at least as wise, and learned, as himself, and see, what Argu∣ments they can alledge for it, and whether those arguments be satisfactory, or no; Nor would I require more pains, or industry in the case in question, than such an applica∣tion of prudence to be satisfied in the truth of a future state, and he that would thus proceed, must, be strangely stupid, if he be not convinced of the verity and ra∣tionality of it.
But when I speak of enquiring into the truth of the Notion before us, I do not mean a slight, or superficial survey of it, not a flash of conception, which like Light∣ning (to ufe Plutarch's phrase) dies as soon, as born, but a serious weighing, and pondering the matter; for it would seem a strange effect of arrogance, and self con∣ceitedness, to undertake at first sight, to comprehend, and refute all the reasons of a Point, wherein very wise men have em∣ploy'd the contemplation, and study of ma∣ny hours. In all disputes, there are To∣picks

of greater, or lesser weight, and if some of these pregnant Wits find them∣selves able to refel some of the waekest arguments, it's ill Lugick to infer, that threfore they can as easily answer the strongest, and most judicious; And yet this is the usual method, whereby these vain men discipline themselves into un∣belief; They are careful to pick out such additional proofs, which men of Reason super add to their weightiest observati∣ons, and these they take the boldness to cavil at, whilest they avoid those more material evidences, which would stagger their understandings, and write a Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin upon their Lusts and Passions, which careless disposition I can ascribe to nothing so much, as want of CONSIDERATION. And in∣deed it's lamentable to see men endued with Reason, sink so much beheath it, and live in the reverse of those Principles, which the Supreme Architect of Heaven and Earth hath engraven on their Con∣sciences.

To reduce such and other sinful men to a se∣rious Consideration of their spiritual Con∣cerns, is the chief design of this Work and all I shall request of your Grace, is, that you will be pleas'd to peruse it sometimes at your hours of leisure, not that I pretend to have writ more or better on this Sub∣ject, than far more Learned Authors have done before me, but as the mighty Artaxerxes accepted of a cup of water from the hand of a Peasant, so your Grace will let the World see, how great a Master you are in the Art of Condescension, by countenancing the poor Present of,
