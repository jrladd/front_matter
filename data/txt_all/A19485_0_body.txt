Right Hon: and my very good LORD:
SInce I first vnder∣stood,
that it pleased
GOD, of his gracious
mercy, to make choice
of your right hand, to be the hap∣py
Instrument, by which Hee
thought it meete to make this
Kingdome of Great BRITAINE

happy, in rescuing the life of
His Anointed, Our Gracious and
dread Soueraigne, from the Ma∣lignant
Sword of bloud-thirsty
conspirators; I did euer mag∣nifie
the name of the Lord for
you. For not I only; But all the
Inhabitants of this Kingdome
(at least, So many as loue the peace
of Hierusalem, and pray for the
prosperitie of Sion) are bound to
honour you, and to praise God
for you. Seeing that by your
meanes (in preseruing our Soue∣raigne
from the Sword of the
Treacherous) he preserued, for
vs, the matchlesse perfections of
many Princes in one. For in him
we enioy an Augustus, a Commo∣dus,
a Probus, a Pius, a Constan∣tinus,

and a Salomon, a King of
Peace: (without which, neither
Religion, nor Piety, nor Probity,
nor Commoditie, nor Maiesty
can haue their perfect lustre.)
For, his Maiesty is not only, ,
peaceable in himselfe; but, ,
a Peace-bringer to vs in
this Land; and , a
Peace-maker among Forraine
Nations round about: and for
this cause, highly honoured and
deuoutly prayed for, by all sorts
of People, euen beyond the
Seas; as being One, whom they
hope God hath ordained to be
a principall meanes to heale the
fresh-bleeding wounds, and to
staunch the Bloudy-issue of
Christendome. So that all Chri∣stendome,

for his Maiesties pre∣seruation,
next vnder God, stan∣deth
bound vnto you. My Lord
(I am a plaine-brested man: Hee
that knoweth me, knowes I can∣not
flatter) This, with many o∣ther
expressions of goodnesse,
was that which did first not in∣uite,
but enforce me to loue and
honour you. I may bow to
your Greatnesse; but it is your
Goodnesse that claimes from me
all loue and vnfained honour to∣wards
you: And heerein I doe
but imitate your Lordship; who
had rather weare the style of a
Good man and an Honest Lord,
then of a Rich man and a Great
Lord. And you heerein do imi∣tate
the Lord of all Lords, who, al∣beit

he be Deus Optimus, Max∣imus:
of All thats good, the best;
and of all thats great, the grea∣test:
yet, notwithstanding, as
Pliny saith,Plinius in Pane∣gyric Traian: dict. He is prius optimus
quam maximus. Hee prefers his
goodnesse before his greatnesse.
Wherefore (howbeit
Tantò sim pessimus omnium propheta,
Quantò Tu optimus omnium Patronus)
I presumed to present these
worthlesse Papers to your Lord∣ship,
trusting only vpon your
Goodnesse for a liberall Accep∣tance.
For (vnlesse the wiser Sa∣ges
haue deceiued me,) Bounty
and Liberalitie consist not only in
Giuing, but also in a cheerfull and
gracious Accepting and receiuing
of a Present. The slenderer the

Present, & the meaner the Giuer
is, the more doth it commend and
increase the Liberalitie of the
Noble Receiuer. For to Prin∣ces
and great Potentates, we doe
not so much giue the Thing it
selfe which we doe present vnto
them; as in It, wee doe make
tender of our very Hearts, our
Loue, Dutie, Honour and dearest
Regards. All these I heere pre∣sent
to your Goodnesse, and (not
doubting of your Noble accep∣tance)
commend you to the
goodnesse of Him that hath ho∣noured
you on Earth, and will
glorifie you in Heauen:
