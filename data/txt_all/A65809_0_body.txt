MEn, Brethren, and
Fathers, when I
consider that all
men generally by
Nature, and Uni∣versities
by designe desire and

endeavour to Know, and yet
generally all live crosse to that
principle when they come to
act in the matters of God, I
cannot but be astonished: for
though the knowledg of him be
demonstrably the most excel∣lent,
yet, as the Apostle obser∣veth,
they like not to retain
God in their knowledg, Rom.
1. 28. Arationall Tract of
Insects, or any such thing, is
bought, and read, and studi∣ed,
admired and commended,
whilest the Word of God is a
Book which men are rather a∣shamed
not to have, then de∣light
to read and understand.
Now the great mischief of do∣ting
upon the knowledg of the

Creature, and despising the
knowledge of the Creator, is,
that as they did reprobate the
knowledge of God, so God did
give them up to a reprobate
sense, as the Apostle speaketh
in the following words. Wher∣fore,
since the insatiable de∣sire
of knowledge and unsan∣ctified
learning is a snare,
though it be looked upon as a
harmlesse and an innocent
thing, and in that respect the
more dangerous, I shall crave
leave to give some Christian
advises for study.
Adv. I. Get holiness before
you get learning: for,
1. Except you be holy your
learning it self is defiled and
defileth.

2. It puffs up, It builds not
up.
3. You must never think by
Learning unsanctfied to learn
the things of God, 1 Corin.
2. 14. Nor will the Socini∣ans
distinction serve, that it is
meant of carnall debauched
men, for it is not , but
.
4. If it were no hinderer it
were far better, but it is an ut∣ter
Enemy; nay it is not only
an Enemy, but Enmity, yea
enmities, Romans 8. 7.
And indeed, an enemy may
be reconciled, but Enmity
never. 2 Corinthians 10. 5.
It builds strong holds and Syl∣logisms
against Gospel truths,

and accounts the knowledge of
Christ an illiterate thing.
Pardon me if I desire to know
nothing among you but Jesus
Christ, and him crucified. If
I wrote to those that despise
Learning, I should in that
case shew them many great
advantages humane Learning
gives one, if sanctified, and
that one might as well not make
use of Riches as not of Lear∣ning
in the service of God:
yet since I write to you, whose
great businesse is to get know∣ledg,
I must say of that as it is
said of Riches, If humane
Learning increase, set not
your hearts upon it. And
though for a man to be holy is

no hinderance but rather a fur∣therance
to him in the get∣ting
of learning; yet to be
learned is a great hinderance
to the getting of holinesse,
that is, if he be first lear∣ned
before holy.
5. Except you have holi∣nesse,
you will be subject to
run out to the wild and un∣godly
studies of Jacob Bo∣heme,
Astrology, &c. for
'tis grace that directs the
choyce and moderates the use of
studyes.
6. That of our Saviour
carryes all before it, Matth.
6. 33. Seek ye first the King∣dome
of God, and his righ∣teousnesse,
and all these

things shall be added unto
you. But alas! how unpro∣portionable
and unsutable are
the lives of Christians to the
rule of Christ, and how few
doe account it their businesse to
be Christians? But I have
spoken of that in the following
Treatise.
II. Advice. Take heed of
making an idol of humane
Reason: and that you do when
you make God and all his
Truths do homage to it; when
you set Reason in the Throne,
and bring Christ & his Truths
to the Barr, to be judged by
it. To shew the vanity of
this, Consider,

1. How much Reason is
puzled in the works of Nature,
as Reason calleth them, (for
David saith, God giveth him
his body, Psalm 139. And
the Apostle saith, Hee giveth
to every seed its own body,
1 Cor. 15.) Can any Philoso∣er
tell me what it is to See, or
Hear, and what those Spe∣cies
are they speak of? Nay,
in the Mathematicks, where
Reason sits in her Throne, yet
even there are not onely many
Problems which it cannot do,
but also many Theorems which
contradict known Principles:
That wee should pass from one
Extreme to another without
passing by the midst, is contra∣ry

to a Principle; and yet it
is necessary to be so, as by this
Diagram shall appear. A
right Line may make an Angle


lesse then a
right An∣gle
with a
circumfe∣rence,
and
an Angle
bigger then a right Angle,
but never equall, as f b a
is lesse then a right An∣gle,
since it is but a part
of f b d: now if you can
draw a line that shall make
an Angle with the Cir∣cumference
a b equall to
a right Angle, let it be b
g. Therefore since g b a is

equall to a right Angle, it is
equall to f b d: take away
f b a, which is common to
both; therefore a b d and
f b g are equall: but a b d
is lesse then f b g. Euclid.
lib. 3. prop. 16. There is
another doubt that no skill
that I bave in the Mathema∣ticks
can resolve, viz. That
a wheel of one inch the Se∣midiameter,
should measure
nine yards, or any other di∣stance
in one revolution: Let
there be three wheels fixed to
the same axis, the middlemost
an inch semidiameter, the two
extreme wheeles each three
yards the Diameter, let the
middle wheel run upon a ta∣ble,

and the two extreme wheels
upon the ground: now it is
certain the middle wheel slides
not, nor stands still when the
others move, and yet it makes
as long a line in its revolution
as the others do.
2. Some things, even in the
very wisdome of men would
seem to be very folly, if so
be the reason of their actions
were not discovered to us. I
am confident, that Sentence
of Solomon concerning the
two women would seem foolish,
cruell, and unjust, if one had
gone away so soon as ever
that Sentence had been pro∣nounced:
for were it not very
cruell and unjust to deprive

a mother of her child? an
Infant of its life, for no de∣fault
of either? and foolish,
for would not the living child
be dead when it was divided
into half? and so each mother
would have but two halfs of
two dead Children in stead of
one baving one whole dead
child. And it would have
required no lesse then So∣lomons
wisedome to finde
out the reason of that sentence,
and it was one part of it to
give such a sentence that
might least seem to do what
he intended, lest the mother
that pretended to the living
Childe, discovering his design,
might give such an answer

that should not discover what
Solomon intended to mani∣fest:
So some of the wayes of
God, the reasons of them
are past finding out, except
by the same wisdome that
contrived them; nay it may
be, God doth some things on
purpose to deceive humane rea∣son,
and that some of the rea∣sons
of his ways are so full of
wisdome, that were they re∣vealed,
we were no more able
to understand them, then a
child of three yeers old, could
understand some propositions
in Euclid, Vietta, Car∣tes,
Apolonius, or Archi∣medes.
3. It seems that God hath

So ordered matters, that ex∣cept
we love him and his truths
there shall be such objections,
that the wit of man can never
answer. I shall give you an
instance of this both in the
speculative and practicall part
of Religion, Deuter. 13. ver.
1, 2, 3. If wee might discover
the deceit of that prophet by
humane reason or wisdome,
without the love of God be∣ing
in us, how could it prove
whether wee did love GOD
or no, if wee could finde out
the fallacy of that deceit
without love? 2. In the 2d
of Thessal. 2. 10, 11. God
will send strong delusions,
that those which love not the

truth, be they never so learned,
shall not be able to know it;
for if so be it were said they
should professe lyes, it might
be, that they knew the truth
though they professed the con∣trary;
but it is said, they
beleeved lyes. Our saviour
gives this reason why hee
would manifest himselfe to
his Disciples, and not to the
world, viz. because the world
did not love him, John 14.
22, 23. For none will unbosome
himselfe unto an Enemy,
nor mayst thou think to master
God by thy Learning, and
know him whether he will or
no; for God must manifest
himselfe, or else thou

canst never know him, and
he will not manifest himselfe
to thee except thou love him,
though thou beest never so lear∣ned
or great a Politician, Mat.
11. 25. For you must under∣stand,
it is not a speculative
knowledge, but a knowledge of
acquaintance. So in that sense is
that saying of our Saviour ve∣rified,
Matth. 7. 23. And this
knowledge of God is not got
by study, but by prayer and
meditation, by an inward strict
communion with God, and the
friends of God the Saints, but
especially with Christ the Son
of God, for he is the ex∣presse
image of God the Fa∣ther,
&c. Can we be ac∣quainted

with a man whether
he will or no? nor can we
be throughly acquainted with
a wise holy man, that is, we
cannot know his wisdome and
holinesse without much obser∣ving
and pondering his words
and actions; nor can we much
observe and be acquainted
with any with whom wee
do not dwell and have pri∣vate
Conference. Thou mayst
know God to discourse of
him, and to write learned
tracts, yet if thou art not
acquainted with God, at
the last day God will not know
thee: Therefore be much
with God; and to that purpose,
I have one humble and ear∣nest

request to you, though
I need not be very ear∣nest
to obtaine so small
one, it is, that you would
spend an hour every day
in prayer, meditation, and
searching out the inward spi∣rituall
corruptions of your
owne heart, and an imparti∣all
examining what interest
you have in Christ, and such
like spirituall exercises; do
not you say, How can you prove
that we are bound to spend one
hour every day? For 1. Sup∣pose
God, when you goe
to prayers, should answer
you so, How can you prove
that I am bound to give
you such a mercy?

Thou mayst cause God to carry
himselfe as froward by this
froward answer; for it is
said, With the froward he
will shew frowardnesse. 2.
How wilt thou spend eterni∣ty
in the admirings, adore∣ings
and praysings of God, if an
hour spent so, is now so irk∣some
to thee? how shall it
then be thine Heaven, if it be
now thine hell? 3. Is it
a friendly answer? If a
friend should come to desire a
courtesie of you, do you so an∣swer
him? how can you prove
that I am bound to do it? 4.
Consider, This is the question
of a slave to ask; What must I
do? but the question of a

friend and a child is, What
may I doe to please my Father
or my friend? 5. Keepe
this answer untill the World
or the Flesh come unto thee;
give this answer to those thine
enemies, and not to thy God.
6. Dost thou stand out? Shall
the great and holy God be rea∣dy
and willing to meet thee,
and have communion with thee
as often and as long as thou
pleasest, and shalt thou refuse?
It should be his part, one would
think, to be hard to be intreat∣ted,
not thine: Shall he ac∣count
it his riches to bestow
mercies on thee, and thou ac∣count
it thy trouble to receive
them? 7. Do but doe that

which thou art bound to do;
viz. Love God with all thy
soul, with all thy minde, and
with all thy strength; and then
thou wilt ask, not, Why so
much? but, Why no more?
And indeed, when once thou
hast found the sweetnesse and
profit, thouthy self wilt not
onely continue, but increase
these holy duties: and that is
the reason why I propose no
more time, because I suppose
this being spiritually spent,
more will follow of it self. Da∣vid
wisheth us to taste and see
how gracious the Lord is, not
because he would not have us
feed on him, but because if wee
once taste how good he is, hee

supposeth it needless to wish us
to feed on him. 8. if thy
friend comes to visit thee,
thou wilt afford him an hour
with thanks: he comes in his
own name, but I come unto thee
in my fathers, desiring thee to
afford God as much; if thou de∣niest,
that saying of our Savi∣our
belongs unto thee, John 5.
43. I am come in my Fathers
name, and ye receive me not;
if another come in his owne
name, him ye will re∣ceive.
To conclude, I desire to speak
one word more as to humane
Learning, which I account
of singular use for the under∣standiug
of the word of God,

and have doted on it as
much as any, and love it
still, as much as I dare, for
I account the love of it
dangerous, the use of it ve∣ry
advant ageous; and could
I set down how far I have gone
in it with the same spirit that
Saint Paul doth set down,
(Phil. 3.) his excellencies in
leg all priviledges and righte∣ousnesse,
I would; but I ac∣count
it safer for me to be
thought wholly ignorant, then
to venture priding my self
of that small knowledge
I have: yet thus much I
conceive of humane Lear∣ning,
that besides the incer∣tainty
of it, there are many

inconveniences incident to
it. 1. Our thoughts are
wholly taken up with it
when wee are studying of it,
which are not necessarily so
in other employments; for one
may buy, and sell, and yet
have our mindes often upon
GOD, even in the very
midst of those employments.
2. Men generally judge of
the truths and wayes of Gods
Worship according to that
way of Learning wherein they
excell: Those who excell in
the Fathers and Church Hi∣stories,
are subject to admit
of the Truths and Wayes of
GOD's Worship, because
they are attested and war∣ranted

by them: Those who
most excell in Phylosophy
and Schoole Divinity, they
make Reason the touchstone
to try even Gospell truths by;
yet I doe much esteem of
these Egyptian Jewells,
so wee make not an Idoll
of them, and fall downe and
worship them. 3. And last∣ly,
I finde it as hard a thing
to deny humane Learning as
to get it. Moses is much to
be admired, who being brought
up in all the Learning of
the Egyptians, yet prea∣ched
so plainely as you may
see in Deuteronomy: and
Paul, who preached so ve∣ry
plaine, that his adversa∣ries

objected it against him
Consider what is said, and
the Lord give you under∣standing
in all things.
