SIR:
J Have (though somewhat late) o∣beyed your desires for the publi∣shing of this Sermon. The Ac∣ceptance it found with your Selfe gives me a ground of hope, that it was not unacceptable to others; The judgement of those who are (as your Selfe is) in place of Emi∣nent dignity and Authority, is (usually) the mea∣sure of inferiour judgements. And while our Ma∣gistrates give Testimony of their relishing such a Doctrine as this, I am much perswaded, that God is bringing it to the relish of all his people. When the Kingdomes (that is the people) of this world, shall become the kingdomes of the Lord and
 of his CHRIST, Then (doubtlesse) Kings and Magistrates in all the World shall become the Lords and his Christs. All their Policies shall be turned into Piety, and their Consultations into a zealous Proving what is Acceptable to the Lord. That your Lordship with those venerable Colleagues the Magistrates of this City may doe so, and that All the people of this City eying as chiefly the warrant of the Word, so likewise your worke, as a shining President, may doe so, is the prayer (as much as that in so doing your Hon: ble Selfe, and this renowned City un∣der your government shall be happie, is the assu∣rance) of

Januar. 22. d, 1645.
