AS THE CHIL∣dren
of Israel had ines∣timable
cause to praise
the great goodnesse of
almightie God, and to
render condign thanks
vnto him for his most
mercifull deliueraunce
out of their vile capti∣uity
& bondage, which
they so long had sustei∣ned
vnder that proude
resister of Gods omni∣potent
power, king Pharao; Euen so (Right honourable) are
we no lesse bound, to honour, lande, and praise the same
God with immortall thanks, which now of his entire loue,
pitie, and compassion (in this our last age of the world) hath
broken the yoke of our miserable seruitude, vnder that proud
exalter of himselfe, the Romish Antichrist, and of the bond∣men
and slaues of that tyrant, hath made vs free men in his
sonne Iesus Christ through the true knowledge of his eter∣nall
and euerlasting word. For as the people that dwel in the

country called Cimmeria do remaine in continuall darknes,
by reason they want the cleere light of the Sunne which is
so farre distant from them. So were we (poore soules) during
the time of our thraldōe vnder the power of the Pope in like
obscuritie shut & pend vp (as prisoners) in the darke dunge∣on
of his Antichristian iurisdiction, and alwaies constrained
to feed on the scraps of his owne vnsauery and most vnfruit∣full
traditions & diuelish deuices, for lacke of the wholsome
foode of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, whereof the least little
sparke could not be permitted to put forth his light among
vs. But now (my good Lord) seeing that all the sleights and
grounds of the Popes inuentions (which wholy consisteth in
false superstitious worshipping, filthy Idolatry, fained hypo∣crisie,
foolish scrupulositie, with other the like) be cleerly sif∣ted
and boulted out, from the boulting tub of his Canō laws
by infinit godly & learned writers, especialiye by such as bee
here expressed within this volume, it shall behoue vs to em∣brace
and lay sure holde on the profound saiengs of those so
godly writers, or rather vpon the truth vttered by their pens:
that being weaponed with such artillerie, we may be able to
resist & ouerthrow, whatsoeuer the whole Popish army shal
assay to assalt vs with all. For what is the cause that many at
this present day, do fall a lusting after Romish religion, as did
the Israelits to feed on the flesh pots of Aegypts gaine? But
that they despise to apparell themselues with the armour of
Christ, esteeming much better their old apparell of Popery,
although it seeme neuer so vile in the sight of God. Which
miserable and deceiued sort (but yet truly most wilfull & fro∣ward
people) that I might by the mercye of God in some
measure perswade, if not wholy conuert to the truth, I haue
the rather employed my diligence in collecting these com∣mon
places (sincerely expoūded by the authors themselues)
that in the reading and earnest study therof, there may some
sparke of Gods true knowledge, kindle aright vnderstanding
in them, which the Lord graunt, that his onely praise & glo∣ry
may therein be shewed. And now, Right honourable, ha∣uing

as yet no help for the publishing of my Concordance,
which without speciall helpe is like to lye not onely helples,
but also fruitlesse, inclosed in an huge volume of mine owne
writing, wherein I haue spent many yeres, in purpose therby
to profit the studies of the godly affected, in the English
tongue, so that I am not able, as my meaning was, to exhibit
the same vnto you: I shall most humbly beseech your honor
to accept and take in good part, my simple trauailes in this
other worke, which God of his goodnes, in these mine olde
yeres, hath now brought forth in me: That I may not seeme
altogethers vnfruitfull to the Church of God, nor vnthank∣full
vnto you mine especiall good Lord, but that at the least
a testification of my faithfull hart to Gods people, and of my
good will to your honour, may somewhat therein appeare.
For whom as dutie requireth, I wil remaine during life, a cō∣tinuall
intercessour vnto almightie God, that his blessings
may be multiplied vpon you, & that abounding in all good
gifts both of body and mind, you may enioy vpon this earth
a long, life, in perfect health and honour, to his glory,
and to the profit of others, and after the end
of your race, may be blessed for euer in
the felicitie of the faith∣full.
Amen.
