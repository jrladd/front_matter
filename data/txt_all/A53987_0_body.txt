Vertuous Ladies,
WHereas common and low spirits, might suspect this action, as a

design to renew a past sor∣row, seeing me, after a year of mourning, recall the memory of so sad a loss: I know, your more generous souls, will rather interpret my intent, an en∣deavour to allay your too long grief, when I revive the memory of a dear dead Brother: Since your rea∣son, being so near of kind to his, cannot but judge it a weakness, to preferr the passion of an useless sor∣row, above the merit of a pious gratitude.
And yet considering, that others will be so par∣tial, as to blame, what∣ever their fancies do not approve: I must forbear to heighten the cause of sadness, by recounting the particulars of your loss; only I would fain begg your leaves, to acquaint the world, that in this they and you are partners. But how shall I effect that? since experience hath now taught the vulgar, what was formerly re∣served to the knowledge

of the more prudent; That the commendation of our friend is frequent∣ly but the cloak of a self-conceited folly: And the world having been of late so much abused by hypocrisie, is now be∣come suspicious even of vertue, if once recom∣mended; especially by a person, whose obscurity leaves him lyable to their censure. However the love of goodness, the ob∣ligation of friendship, and consciousness of truth,

shall prevail with me to the hazard of re∣pute
I should indeed, both betray an high folly in my self, and injure the worth of my Friend, should I, considering my own dis∣ability, undertake to dis∣course at large of all his merits; and yet thus much I cannot but say, his in∣genuous discourse, his modest deportment, his humility and candour, gained a more then or∣dinary

respect from all that ever he conversed with, and this they shall witness for me: They that had the happy op∣portunity of knowing him more throughly, found his Learning so great, and communicat∣ed with that freeness; his piety so true, and pra∣ctised with that inno∣cence, that they could not but love him with admiration, which also increased in those that had a more special and

constant intimacy with him; for such knew him so passionate a Lover of all ingenuous Learn∣ing, that he ever count∣ed that hour lost, which was not imployed in some kind or other of it. He hated naught so much as idleness, or doing no∣thing, and that made his very recreations, as seri∣ous as others studies. And this gave him the advan∣tage of being skilled in modern languages: which although he attained unto,

by a sagacity proper to his disposition, and his own industry, yet his courtesie would afterwards enter∣tain discourse with the common Tutors and pro∣fessed Teachers of them upon all emergent occasi∣ons. This his true love to Learning, gave our Nation the opportunity of knowing the Nature and Constitution of the new Famous French Academy, by his translation of their History, written by Mon∣sieur P. Pellison, which

was a thing so acceptable to the Author, that he was pleased to write him a particular acknowledge∣ment, and communicate to him also this present Treatise, which likewise at times of divertisement he taught to speak Eng∣lish: In the perusal of which, I doubt not but the more ingenuous will reap satisfaction, and find sufficient cause to love the Translators memory, if they consider that it is not offered as a part of his

more solid labours, but as a valuable Essay of wit, and to be used as it was made, only in a Diver∣sion.
That which I offer to you, worthy Ladies, I give not as a Present, but repay as a due, which without injustice I cannot detain; a greater reason, then that which engageth me to a publication, entituling you to the right of Patronage: For the memory of a dear friendship cannot herein

challenge any thing from me, but what the interest of a nearer relation makes entirely yours, and toge∣ther with it, the Devoirs of
