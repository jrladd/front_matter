READER,
THE Subject of this Book is Growth in Grace, a noble Sub∣ject, yea the most noble; for what is more excellent and desirable than Grace, and Growth in it? Thereby our Election, likeness unto God, union with Christ, inhabitation of the Spirit, ripeness and readiness for Glory, are clearly evidenced unto us. This is therefore the principal Argument wherewith a gracious Soul should be taken, and lay out the principallest of its time and strength in getting there∣of, and growing therein: It argues ig∣nobleness of spirit to set any limit or mea∣sure to Grace and Holiness, shorter than what the Spirit of God it self hath

set, viz. The measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; whoso doth it, blunts the edge of desires and endea∣vours, and will sit down content with one grain of Grace. The Reverend, laborious and judicious Preacher of these Sermons, whose Growth in Grace was well known, would have you, not only gracious, but eminently gracious, Cedars, not shrubs, which will tend to your greater advantage than can be ex∣press'd: Be pleased therefore to read, and seriously consider, what is herein tendred unto you, and you will find your hearts so warm'd thereby, that you will be of the Authors mind, concerning the great Duty of growing in Grace; which that you may be, and so do, is the Prayer of him who desires your Per∣fection.
