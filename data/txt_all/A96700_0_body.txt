My Lords,
I Have chosen to present you with this Volume, not onely as it is worthy of the Ages past, but also of your Lordships present view, the Affinity of your Blood and Greatness, challenging from me no less then these prostrate respects, as I could desire no firmer nor safer an Anchorage then in so proper a Dedication, no despairing that my Pen hath produc'd something worthy of your entertainments; as I have set be∣fore your eyes forty seven Select Lives of our English Heroes, the greatest Princes, the most Reverend Cleargy-men, eminent States-men, and valiant Souldiers all deceast: As to History it self, a Modern Writer expresses, 'tis the study of the Holy Scripture that becomes a Gentleman; of the Ecclesiastical Hi∣story, a Christian; and of the Brittish History, an English man; all which Qualifications in some measure meeting in your Honours, as well as in this Work it self, gives me some assu∣rance that these my weak endeavours would not be unwelcome to you. My Lords, he that hath the Spirit and Blood of his Ancestours in his veins, cannot be so much turned into a Statue as to stand still and admire the different Fortunes, this mans
greatness, and of that mans lowness, so as not onely to reflect on the tributary brooks of the former Matches of the Nobility, but also to look back to matter of fact what our Predecessours have been, as well as what we our selves at the present are, least falling short of the imitation of their immortal actions, we so strangely degenerate, as not to understand what we our selves ought to be. The clear Fountain flowing from the true Nobility of late being so disturbed, it is the office of an honest and true Historian, if not his duty, to have so much of the He∣rald, as to Register the Descents, Issues, worthy Acts, At∣chievements, Mannagements of our of late so little imitated Ancestors; of these several alterations in Nobility one ob∣serves, there are three principle Actors on the Theater of great Families; the Beginner, Advancer, and Ruiner; in all these our uncivil troublesome times we have heard more of the latter then of the other two; one experiencst though unfortunate good, amongst the many mischiefs, which a Civil War occasions, is that in the ransacking of Studies, accidentally, though determi∣ned otherwise, the Togati and the Armati meet; several Manu∣scripts which otherwise would have remained useful only to pri∣vate persons, have been by Divine Providence miraculously pre∣served, contrary to the intentions of the Agents, whose Barba∣rismes had snuft out the candle to the present Age, and depri∣ved posterity of those Illustrations from which they might know that truth, which otherwise they should never have been ac∣quainted with: as they endeavoured that the most remarkable Affairs of these times should have otherwise been hid under a bushel. To your Honor, my Lord Herbert, I make this particular Address, though this Dedication is joynt, as in respect of your happy Assinities, as you are Father-in-law to one of these youth∣ful Branches of Honour, in respect of your advantages of some years, so your grandeur and experience renders you a History of your self, and in respect of their tender ages another to them. My Lord, I know to your Honour it is no less then a Prodigy that our English Gentlemen should be more exact and refin'd
in knowing the Religion, Laws, Governments, Strengths, Scites, Customs, and Fashions of Forreign Countreys, then of their own wherein themselves are Natives, which caused a de∣serving Historian, as it were, to sigh out this expression, What pitty is it for a proper Gentleman to have such a crick in his neck, that he cannot look so much as over his shoulder to know his own History; much less so far behinde him, as to reflect on actions long since performed. I have presumed to intimate thus much to your Honor, as you are another Burleigh or Raleigh, to give better advice to your youthful Kinsmen. My Lords, I have chosen you as out of the Caesars, to affix your names to this Epitome of Lives, that as Julius was his own History and Commentary, so your Honours though yet but in the abstract of time, might pass it to posterity; to which purpose, I have chosen your united protections. Since I have been writing this History, there hath been no less then three alterations, Regal, Protector∣ship, and now a Commonwealth; I first undertook this enterprize in the time of Monarchy, continued it in the short space of Prote∣ctorship, and finished it in the immediate initiation of the Com∣monwealth: in all which progressions, if the Liberty of the Sub∣jects modest prospects are shut up, or not allow'd, if in these days that Lots little one of truth, by these present times posterity must be deprived of, wise and honest men will be seriously sensible of such obstructions; the maliciousness of such Machiavillians puts me in mind of what elegant Mr. Fuller cites what Naturalists observe of the Toad, who before she can be surprized by death, sucks up the supposed precious stone in her head, which till then was but a jelly; thus some men are so cowardly that they had rather have History buried with them, then that the least part of civil truth should be writ whilest they live, as if they deserved no Chronicle, or were only to be suffered in Libellous Pamphlets, which wise men scorn to cast their eyes on. I confess we live in times of Jealousies, nevertheless there is no danger in a Dedi∣cation that drives on a harmless design, which for the Innocency of it, craves protection from such tender years. My Lords, I
wish that your Families may ever flourish, whose Charities like the expected showres have refresht our parched English Earth, being nevertheless so undescernable as the winde, the left hand not knowing what the right hand did; the so eminent Noblesses of your Generous Blood hath obliged our English world, and amongst the rest of my Countrey-men, commanded me to present these humble respects to your Lordships. In the tender of these Lives, My Lords, I have turned the Mirror of them to you, ex∣pecting that by your future Atchievements you will get up hill to these Worthies, not questioning but some other Pen when I am in my silent grave will raise Pyramids to your Names, and affix you to this Volume: If your Lordships in your inspect at my turning of this Mirror to you, still perceive somewhat re∣maining of a sad representation, a once sable mourning cloud, 'tis now so serene, so dispersed with the Beams and Splendors of Honour, that you may safely be so loyal to Heaven, as with a correlative gratitude, to acknowledge the remarks of that He∣roe. My Lords, as I designed you the Persons of my Dedication, so you bear the Title of my Book in your promising Years and Blood, there being none in England in whom there is a Nobler confluence of so many Loyal Purple Rivelets of Honour, that a mean Herald by the guidance thereof upwards, may be lead to the Fountain and Head-Spring of the English Nobility. Be pleased to accept of these tenders of Service, as also of my best wishes, that as you have met in your Affinities, so joynt Vertues may be united in your Natures, which shall be his request to Heaven, who is the meanest and unworthiest of
