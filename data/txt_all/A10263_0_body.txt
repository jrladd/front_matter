Excellent Lady,
I Present these Tapours
to burne under the safe
Protection of your hono∣rable

Name: where, I presume,
they stand secure from the Damps
of Ignorance, and blasts of Cen∣sure:
It is a small part of that a∣bundant
service, which my thank∣full
heart owes your incomparable
Goodness. Be pleased to honour it
with your noble Acceptance,
which shall bee nothing but what
your owne esteeme shall make it
Madam
