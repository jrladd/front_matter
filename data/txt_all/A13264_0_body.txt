MY GOOD LORD,
THat seruice is most free of in∣sinuatiō, which is so of attendance; whil'st others onely looke on your vertues, with your fortunes, and admire them, I both weigh, and
 contemplate, and so honor you more than they by how much a iust speculation exceedes an outward and partiall suruey of men, and of their actions. 'Tis my beleefe in that hath arm'd my resolution in this bold tender of my labours, which though I acknowledge vnworthy either of your iudge∣ment, or acceptance, yet the noble incouragements and faire inter∣pretations you haue giuen those formerly deliuer'd in your eare, haue taught me a confidence that you will entertaine these also offer'd to your eye; a Judge more seuere than the other, be∣cause more subtle, and (what is more) more deliberate; how∣euer, did I not beleeue they
 would passe the mercy of an ho∣nourable perusall, I should neuer haue expos'd them to the criti∣cisme and comment of a censori∣ous Age, which vnderualues most things because they are common, and many things, because they are good. Though mine can lay no title to the latter in respect of their frame and structure, they may of the subiect, that is sacred, and should at least inuite acceptance, if not in∣force it. As they are (most No∣ble Lord) vouchsafe them enter∣tainment; they were publisht at the importunities of some priuate, but reall friends, to whom they addresse thēselues only for suruey, to you (now) for patronage, they may incourage my proceedings, but
 greatnesse must protect them; your countenance they beg which if you daine to afford, you no lesse crowne them, than the Au∣thor, who in all humilitie deuotes himselfe
