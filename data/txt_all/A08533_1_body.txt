IT is not vnknowne to any that hath peru∣sed the writinges of Heathen writers, how that the Persians kept in their Houses, the picture of an Epicure, sleeping with meate in his mouth, and most horribly ouerla∣den with wine, that by the viewe of such an vgly sight, they might learne to eschew the meanes of the like excesse.
It is also reported, that the Parthians, to make their youths, to loath the alluring traines and deceit∣full entisements of Harlots, had most curiously carued in their Houses, a yong man blind, besides whom was adioyned a woman far more excellent then Pigmalions image: ha∣uing one hand in his pocket, as noting her theft, and holding a knife in the other hand, to cutte his throate.
The like meanes (louing Country-men) wish I you to vse, for the restraint of Puritanisme. Ʋouchsafe (I beseech you) to keepe in your Houses, this Picture of a Puritane, as the Persians did the Picture of an Epicure, and the Parthians the Picture of an Harlot: and I doubt not, but the verie sight therof, will bring your selues, your wiues, your Children, and your ser∣uants, to a full detestation of the Puritan-faction.
Farewell.
