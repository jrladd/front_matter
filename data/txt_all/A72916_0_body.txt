LOE heere, most worthy Ladie,
these Canzonets of mine, like two wayting maydes desiring to attend vpon you; destinated by my Wife (euen before they were borne) vnto your Ladiships seruice. Not that for any great good or bewtie in them shee thought them worthy of you: but that not being able as heretofore still to serue you; she would that these therefore with their presence should make good and supply that hir absence. For hir sake then vouchsafe, gentle Ladie, to en∣tertain them; hauing no other thing to commend them to you for, but this that they are Virgins, neuer yet hauing once been out at doores, nor seene the fashions of the world abroad. And therefore notwithstanding per∣haps in the highest degree they shall not satisfie you: yet if they shall but in any sort content you; I know that the greatest fault you will finde in them shall be for their smalenesse. And so good Madame I cease further to trouble: but not still to srue and honor you.
