Worthy Sir,
HAving read over your Booke intituled, The Utter Rou∣ting of the whole Army of the Independents and Sectaries, &c. And found in your answers plenary sa∣tisfaction to whatsoever was objected against your ar∣guments in your former Booke intituled, Independency not Gods ordinance; I could not so content my selfe without signifying unto you the same, and rturning you many thankes for the great paines and indefatigable diligence you have used therein, being perswaded if all those who are staggering between In∣dependency and Presbyteri, would but read it ever with an impartiall eye, it would fully settle their judgements. Nay if those of the Congrgati∣ons called joyn'd Members, would but read it without prejudice, I am confident they would not only harbour a better opinion of the Presbytery, but see such faylings in their owne way, as justly to relinquish it. But I behold not that charity in them, that they would perswade the world they are indowed with, nor that love to their brethren that is to be desired in those th make profession of the Gospell, and speake so much of love and charity as they do. The time was that they bad honourable thoughts of you to my knowledge, and spake as much in your praises as in any mans now living, before you declared your judgement for the Presbyters: but since that, their hatred it sufficiently knowne, for their language and practice doe manifest it, not only by all shamefull reviing of you, and by dispara∣ging
 both you and your books, by all manner of contumelies, but by pulling down the Titles of your Books wheresoever they are set up,  hndering the publishing of them by all their abilities, which apparantly  their inveterate malice against you, which dealing of theirs, as it is very unchristian, so it shewes what liberty of Conscience wee might expect at their hands, if they were once our masters. Neither may they pretend that you aid provoke them by your writings: for before ever you had put Pen to paper, or writ any thing against their opinion, they only understan∣ding that you were of a contrary judgement, did then as despightfully use you in all manner of scurrilous language as now they doe as can suffici∣ently be proved. It is only your opinion, in that you differ from them that makes you odious to them, for they liked your mery humour at other times against the Prelats: But they seeme to have some ground for it if they may be beleeved, for thy have been often heard to affirme, that you were once one of them, and it was told me by many, that those women that ac∣companied Jhn Llburnes Wife to the Parliament upbraided you to your face before all the people that you had been once one of them and called you an apostate, and persecutor of the saints. This information makes me the more bold to request a small favur from you which is this, that I might have it under your hand whether you were ever in your opinion an Independent, Sectary or Anabaptist, &c. that I may satisfie others about it; for I heard they were all such that did abuse you. Now, if you were not. I shall desire you with as much brevity as so weighy a businesse will suffer you to use, to give me your judgement, what you conceive of all those new opinions lately hatcht amongst us: and as you have largely writ against the Independents, so that now you would furnish me with some ar∣guments against the Anabaptists, which is now become one of the chiefe Sects, and for multitude (if they may be credited) the greatest and most prevalent in the Kingdome; for I know you will deale candidly in the whole businesse, and so good an opinion I have of you, that you will doe nothing for disputation sake, but for truth and conscience sake. Withall, I shall desire you in the whole discourse to use no humane authority, but as you have in all your writings confirmed your opinion by the word of God you would still use the same weapon to defend the truth, and oppose errour, which I shall take for a singular Christian kindnesse, and according to my ability, if it satisfies my expectation, I shall labour that others may also partake with me in the truth, and be preserved from the errours of the
 times. I wish from my heart, that ry family in this City, nay in the whole Kingdome, that desires to know the state of the controversie between us and the Independents would downplay some of thse  they usually spd in their retreat  in the reading of your st Booke,  the Utter Routing &c. that so both they and their  ight b preserved from the cunning craftinesse of those that lie in wait to deceive. I ha∣ving read no Booke since the broching of this new tenent of Independency, that comes so neere and full to the businesse. Neither would I disparage  this; but I speake according to what I have xperiece of, and from the benefit that others have received by per∣using of it▪ who have acknowledged that the reading your Booke did not only seule them, but many hundreds of others that have from it. And which is yet more some Independents have acknowledged, that they were convinced by reading of your Booke which I conceive, to be one of the principallest causes that makes them so much maligne you, and hinder the publishing of it. And others of them upon the reading of your booke, have writ out of the Countrey to some of their fraternity here in London, telling thm▪ that they had read your Booke, saying moreover, that they could witnesse that you had writ nothing of them and their practices, but what they could witnesse to be true and therefore earnestly exhorted them to mend their manners, and carry themselves so as beseemed the Gospell, all this can bee abundantly proved which induces me to believe, that if that Book were but knowne amongst the people they would either speedily be undeceived if they were seduced, or bee preserved from the errours of the times. All that I have now to say unto you besides my good wishes is this; You have had great experience of Gods love unto you, who hath hitherto preserved you, and delivered you out of so many dangers and from so many deaths, and from the fury of so ma∣ny enemies and preserved you in the truth; who with all their fury, rage, and reproches, have never in any thing beene dismayed; I shall therefore earnestly desire you to consider that you serve the same master still, who is the same All sufficient Jehovah, be constant therefore to maintaine his cause and truth to the death, and be not discouraged with any thing any enemy can doe unto you; which words I utter not as in the least doubting of your resolutions, but out of my hearty desire of your honour and happi∣nesse
 which your sability and constancy will crowne with a Lrell of i∣mortall praises manger all enemies. I pray sir, faile no with the snest to let me receive thse Arguments I desire, and to heare of your health and happinesse, and the welfare of all your, and you shall ch  and rejoyce  who is
Sir,

From my house in Scalding Alley, at the Hand and Pen, this 25 of March, 1647.
