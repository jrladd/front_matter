YOur Souldier (most gracious and worthie Prince) hath once againe betaken him to his Penne; he hath, to auoyd idlenesse, endeuored with Do∣mitian to catch flies, he grasped at greater matters, then his abilitie was able to reach vnto. He meant to haue mounted the Alpes, that stumbled by the way at a sorie Mole-hill. But I see it is Souldiers lucke, for when they hope to effect wonders, they conclude with iust nothing. I dare not therefore present these trifles as worthie your gracious view, I know they are too slight for your greatnesse, and too meane a present for so high re∣nowne: Shall I offer them yet vnder the examples of the Widowes mite, or, the handfull of water that was offered to Alexander. Me thinkes the conceit
is growne too stale, when euerie bastard Poet hath alreadie worne it threed-bare: no, I present them with a Souldiers faithfull heart, that is still armed to the proofe, to doe your Grace all humble and dutifull seruice. If my lines bee of little worth, your Graces name is of great worth, and inough to shrowde both them and me from the prowdest contemner. The rude Poet Cherilus, had nothing worthie to be noted in his verses, but onely the name of Alexander: And I confesse my fruites are too vntimely to be gathered in the age of this ripe and plentifull haruest. I haue therefore with Che∣rilus the better to adorne them, humblie presu∣med of that gracious fauour, that hath al∣readie tied me with all dutie and zeale, to lay my hands vnder your Highnesse feete.
