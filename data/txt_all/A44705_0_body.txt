SIR,
THat Sober and Grave Apophthegme, which I finde given by the Antient Jewes  Sile & liberaberis, in English thus Be silent and be safe, gave a little check to my Resolves both for the Pulpit and the Press. That Impress, which Cam∣bden in his Remaines tells us a Gentleman chose, Tuti montes, tutum silentium; Silence and soli∣tude the best shelter, takes no smal impression upon me. He that travails abroad in publick, must expect to be wounded by two Thieves, Envy & Ignorance; the first hath his eye alwaies upon a blot, and he will be sure to hit it; and the summ of his numeration is onely what was spoken ill. The second, as he some∣times admires, so he as often condemns that which he understands not. He that knoweth least, carpeth most; to make good that Proverb, That a Flie hath a spleen. Let the Dish and the Dressing be what it will, there being variety of palates, as were among Horace his Guests, it's an hundred to one, but the Cook is quarrelled with. But, Sir, my Resolve rather to serve you, their secure my self, brought we first upon the
Stage; and its the same that makes me continue so. Your Command bound me for the Pulpit, and to the Auditory, by way of Discourse; and your Candor brings me to the Press, and to your Self, by way of Dedica∣tion. What was presented to your Ears, is here repre∣sented to your Eyes: not as commanding your pains in the review, but craving your Patronage. Your Com∣mand did first give life to these Conceptions; they are therefore Yours. I humbly expect that right, that you will own them. The Subject was seasonable, had the Speaker been suitable; the Subject deserves your Pa∣tronage, the Speaker desires your Pardon. It is print∣ed, as it was preached, without alteration, save only that I present it to you intire, as it was penn'd, with some few reserves of Application in the close, which my fear of too bold entrenchment upon publick Con∣cerns made me omit. It is not Ambition, but Obedience to your Self, and the commanding Requests of other Friends that makes me appear in print; & if I meet with ill measures from any that read it, I can esteem it one Compensation, that it is, whilest I am,
SIR,
