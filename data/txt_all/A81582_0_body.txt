SIR,
THe rare blssing (mentioned by that royall Pro∣phet) is by the Father of lights, and giver of all good things; plentifully poured upon you, Childrensaith he, and the fruit of the Wombe are an inheritance from the Lord, Psal. 127. 3, 4. Wherewith your quiver is well filled: And happy are you that you are so blessed; you shall not be asha∣med when you sit in the gates among your Enemies.
God make your Sonnes his servants, the Patterns of Virtue, the haters of Vice: That your Sonnes may like pleasant Plants stand about your Table: And your Daugh∣ters like the polished corner of a Palace.
This small Catechisme divulged by me. I consecrate to them and you, I have no better gift to bestow on you for your superabundant benefits which makes me presume to present this paper present.
For though your Gentle courtesies I reherse,
at present I must pay yu with a verse.
God blesse your Virtuous Consort to you, and you to her, your children to you both, so having no present opportunity whereby I could more eminently testifie by obligations, I pray accept of this. For I call both God and the World to witnesse that this way I honour you, resting alwaies.

From my Studie in Swasham,
Jan: 1. 1653.
