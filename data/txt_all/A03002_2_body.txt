MADAME.
I Must needes be faithfull to my
grounds: Once I remember I
chose you all for my Zodiacke,
though but foure; yet foure
such, whose light could not be
lesse worth then for twelue:
And wonderful great must that
great light be indeed, whose glorious beames I haue
seene euen from Fraunce, euen through mine eares,
though mine eyes could not as yet be so happy, as
to looke vpon your faces. I thanke God that accor∣ding
to my wish, there hath been so brightfull a starr
since added to your number, and so good an order
taken for the filling vp of that want, which then I
was bold to marke in that faire circle. No doubt
but by these fortunate coniunctions, there will arise
such a quantity of new Planets vpon our Orizon; of
worthy Knights (no lesse then Castor and Pollux) of
braue Lyons, of faire Virgins, and other bright shi∣ning

starres; as too farre exceeding one Zodiacke,
they shall wander farre and wide from this English
heauen through the remote clymes of this world,
where your famous name and fame will shine for e∣uer.
In the meane time ioying and wondering at so
much light as there is, let this serue me towards you
and to all the world, still for a witnes (though small)
of my sincerest zeale (though hitherto but vaine and
without fruit) how farre I am, or rather would be,
