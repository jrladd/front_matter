WHO so shall duely obserue Homer
describing contention (vvhom he
nameth the sister of Mars,Lib. 4. Ilia. being
at her birth litle, but after, though
keeping her feete on the earth, yet
increasing till she touch the hea∣uens
vvith her head: procuring
in this grouth, noises, debates, di∣scensions,
teares, sighes and late
repentance) vvil say, notvvithstanding that the Poet vvere
blind, that he savve as farre as our time in which this foo∣lish
Goddesse shaketh like a fearefull earthquake the founda∣tions
both of the Ecclesiasticall and ciuill state. In considera∣tion
vvhereof (right honorable Lord) and that many are
moued by some aspects of contention iniuriously to report her
Maiesties proceedings vvith the Spaniard (she hauing li∣ued
in greater temperance then any Prince of her time) I
thought meete (those rumors extenuating his ambition and
auarice long preceding any act done by her Maiestie to him)
to prooue that his enterprises and desire of this kingdome

vvere of longer life then her Maiesties attemptes: to the
end that our people (apprehending his iniustice for piety, offe∣red
against the dignitie of Kings, and equitie of nations)
may, knovving the counterfeit, abide in their place of obe∣dience
and dutie. This labour, though neither for matter or
volume, vvorthy your honorable vievve, I notvvithstan∣ding
(as bound heretofore for your L. fauors tovvards me to
yeeld some agreeable seruice) humbly dedicate to your good
L. vvhose noble bearing dravveth to it by a forcible povver
of vertue, the hartie and good affections of all men. Take
therefore my good Lord the same in good part of him, vvho
prayeth to your L. increase of long health, honor and all the
vertues of true Nobilitie.
