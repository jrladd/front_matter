WHat your favourable im∣ployments
haue taught
me to obserue, I presume
here briefly to relate I
hope it will be accepta∣ble,
because innocent,
though nothing excel∣lent.
Vera, non mira cam, assured that with your
more acurate judgements. Plus valebit vera oratio
quam carminis candida & maxime compta in singulos pe∣des
commensuratio. Censure at the least would be
my best sentence, if I should answer such ser∣vice
with a NIHIL DICIT. VVhen in
contempt of Envy, I may present your Coun∣cell

with an OMNE BENE, at least, Certâ
spe boni, if the three noble Mistresses of Monar∣chies,
Pietas, Pecunia, and Potentia, royally vn∣dertake
and resolutely continue constant fa∣vourers
to their well ordered and sweetly si∣tuated
Colonies. Without these, at least the two
latter (I suppose vnder favour) the Spanyard and
Hollander had d Graecas callendas raysed to such
sweet tones their westerne and easterne flou∣rishing
Plantations. But illorum postpono mea sera
ludo. The keys of Kingdomes, judicious States∣men
are best able to open and explicate these
closets and secrets of state. I may admire, but
scarce without offence obserue such princely
attempts and royall secrets. Yet giue me leaue
to you worthy favourers of Colonies, as in armes
and architecture to be your remembrancer,
first to accompt, and then to accomplish: so
power and abilitie shall crowne your procee∣dings
with happie perfections. Beyond these
I presume nothing, onely wishing every per∣son
in his severall sphere such happie motion
as may crowne him with immortall perfec∣tion.
