THE first Part of this Poeme (most Jllustrious Prince) I dedicated to your deceased Brother of most famous Memorie, whose princely Bountie, and vsage of mee, gaue me much encouragement to goe on with this second Part, or Continuance thereof; which now as his Successor, J owe to your Highnesse. If meanes and time faile me not, being now ariued at Scotland, I trust you shall see mee crowne her with no worse Flowers, then J haue done her two Sisters, England, and Wales: and without any partialitie, as I dare bee bold, to make the Poets of that Kingdom my Iudges therin. If I ariue at the Orcades, without sinking in my flight, your Highnesse cannot but say, that I had no ill Perspectiue that gaue mee things so cleerely, when I stood so farre off.
