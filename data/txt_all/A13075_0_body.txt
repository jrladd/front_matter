Mr. W. STRVTHER.
THESE first fruits of Thine
owne Grace in mee, I of∣fer
to Thee, O Fountaine
of Grace: Thy thoughts are
pretious to mee, and thy
Meditations sweete. All the desires of



mine heart is to Thee, and to bring thy
Saiuctes to thy fellowship, that in that v∣nion,
they may enjoy Thy selfe, and par∣take
true Happinesse.
Blesse all meanes vsed to that good end,
that they may proue meanes of thine owne
choyse, and worke. But aboue all, shedde
abroad Thy loue in the hearts of Thy peo∣ple,
then our preaching and writting will
bee either lesse needefull, or more fruitfull.
Thou hast won to Thy selfe for euer the
heart that is deepelie affected with the sense
of Thy loue: Thou knowest that it can no
more byde or rest off Thee, than a stone of
it selfe can hing in the aire.
While I thinke of Thee, my thoughts
increase themselues, and while I preasse to
expresse them, I can not satisfie my selfe,
in that expression. Thou art in the heart
that loueth Thee truelie, and that heauen∣lie
affection ouercommeth it twise; once



in vnspeakeable softning sweetnesse; nixt
in an vnsufficiencie to vtter it: But this
is some remeede, that it can poure it selfe
immediatelie vpon Thee: Words & writes
come shorter than thoughts, and thoughts
shorter than the affection, the onelie just
and equall expressing of the affection, is
to thrust it selfe on Thee, and to adhere
and inhere in Thee continuallie. It suffi∣ceth
mee, that Thou knowest mine heart,
and thine owne worke in it.
Let the Meditations of mine heart
and the words of my mouth, bee ac∣ceptable
to Thee, O GOD, my Strength,
and my Redeemer, and direct
Thou the workes of mine
hands, that all may serue to
the magnifying of Thy
glorious Grace,
and edifying
of thy people.
AMEN.
