My Lord,
IF I should under∣take to enumerate the many favours and advantages I have had

by my very long acquain∣tance with your Lordship, I should enter upon an Imploy∣ment, that might prove as tedious, as the Collecting of the Materials for this poor Monument, which I have erected, and do dedicate to the Memory of your belo∣ved Friend Dr. Sanderson: But though I will not ven∣ture to do that; yet I do re∣member with pleasure, and remonstrate with gratitude, that your Lordship made me known to him, Mr. Chi∣lingworth, and Dr. Ham∣mond,

men, whose Merits ought never to be forgot∣ten.
My Friendship with the first was begun almost Forty years past, when I was as far from a thought, as a desire to out-live him; and farther from an inten∣tion to write his life: But the wise Disposer of all mens lives and actions hath prolong'd the first, and now permitted the last; which is here dedicated to your Lordship (and as it ought to be) with all hu∣mility,

and a desire that it may remain as a publick Testimony of my Grati∣tude,
My Lord, Your most affectionate Old Friend, and most humble Servant,
