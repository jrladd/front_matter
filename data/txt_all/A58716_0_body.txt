My Lord,
SO Ancient is the Custome of Dedicating Books to Persons of the greatest Worth and Eminence, whose shining Vertues dis∣play themselves with so much Illustrions Beauty, that like the radiant Beams of the Sun, they forceably Attract the Admiring Eyes of all Men, and create in them a Desire of having their Names found in the Frontisepiece of their Books; that we find it practised even by some of the In∣spired Penmen of the Sacred Scriptures; for St. Luke Dedicates his History of the Life and Actions of our Blessed Saviour, and that of the Acts of the Apostles, to the most Excellent Theophilus.
Your Lordship being one of those few that have adventured to stem the Stream, and pre∣sumed to be Virtuous, when to be Wicked and Debauch'd is in Fashion; And that dare to be
Loyal, when to be so, is the way to be accounted Disloyal, and that dare Oppose the Ambitious Designs of a Malicious and Bloody Party; Toge∣ther with your Lordship's having Suffered so deeply by these Shams, is all the Apology I shall make for presuming to lay these Lines at your Lordship's Feet.
The Malice of your Enemies shall serve as a File to set off the Glory and Lustre of your Lordship's Loyalty, and your Name shall Live when theirs is Dead, and shine in Splendour, when theirs, like a Blaze, is gone out in a Snuff, the remembrance of your Name shall be as the smell of a pleasant Field, or the delightful fra∣grancy which comes from a Garden of Flowers, when the remembrance of theirs shall be nauseous and offensive.
As the mighty Artaxerxes accepted a Cup of Water from the hand of a Peasant, so your Lord∣ship will shew how great a Master you are in the Art of Condescention, by Accepting these poor Indeavours of, my Lord,
