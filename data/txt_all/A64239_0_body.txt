SIR,
I HAD no sooner Reflected upon this my Resolution of engaging your Name in the Front of this Treatise; but was Conscious that pro∣bably (and perhaps deser∣vedly) I might hereby attract the impu∣tation of Impudence, not being confident or assured, that any thing may therein be
found, which may afford either delight or satisfaction to You; or engage You to bestow upon it some few spare minutes (if such may at any time favour You from your greater or more serious Affairs). But find∣ing my self in Gratitude deeply bound and engaged to make this publick Testimony (though a slight one) of my thankfull ac∣knowledgments for those many and extra∣ordinary favours, which I have received from You; the force of this Argument, made void the fear of the former. I have been much longer about this Task, than at first I did propose; yet I can assure you Sir, it met with above a years mis-carriage, by reason of my last absence from Eng∣land. The first Essay at it was made in Scot∣land, being immediately before my going thither by some Friends earnestly there∣unto sollicited, and unwillingly ingaged; where I found but small leisure from my Employments, to accomplish their Desires: yet did credit, that your Affectionate engagements of me afterwards in Dunkirk, whilst you were Governour there, would
have afforded some few hours to have ren∣dred this Piece into a better shape and form; but it is not unknown to You, how and upon what grounds my Expectations were there also Frustrated; insomuch that these undigested Observations are but those I could (Raptim) by small parcells catch from my several Obligements. They are I confess for the most part Nocturnae Lucu∣brationes, Collected for a kind of Diversion, when Lassitude and Weariness proceeding from my daily Turmoyl of employment, invoked a Cessation and Repose; and in this sense only they may be justly said to smell of the Lamp: withall engaging me to restore again the Product of this time into your hands, from whom it was at first in some part Stoln. You have Goodness sufficient to Excuse what in them is amiss; to Methodize them in your own Thoughts; and to Impute that want of Mercury which I am assured you will find in them, to the predominancy of my then Martial planet: it being well known I had more Arms and Provisions of Warr under my Care, than
Books or Papers in my Custody, which last had been by much more convenient for such a Work. Should this pass with your Approbation and Allowance, and stand Protected under your Umbrage; Censure cannot injure him, who shall think himself greatly honoured in being reputed, Much honoured,
