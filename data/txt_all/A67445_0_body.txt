A Thousand to one now you'l be inquiring, who is the Author? Pardon me, if I frankly answer, what need you care? Judge of the Venison, and never trouble your self with asking whence it comes. 'Tis a short Book, though a long Letter; and when you have perus'd a period or two, if you like it, you may read on; if not, lay it down, and be∣take your self to some better businesse: only oblige me with this favour, if you allow not what I have done; teach me what I should have done. This is my case.
Me thought I saw the truth hang clearly on my side, while I consider'd only the weights which each hand laid in the ballance; but the Number of those who strove by plain force to pull down the Other, a little mov'd, I confesse, and shak'd my Scale: yet I easily recover'd my former steddi∣nesse, when I reflected on the Moment one solid Reason has, compar'd to a multitude even of the gravest Opiners: But then they shrewdly heav'd at me again; Why should not the Many be presum'd to have Reason, as well as the Few? against which, thus much, at least, I had to say, and per∣haps somewhat more to think; That since either too strong an Interest, or too weak a Courage, or too slight an Exa∣mination, may justly be suspected as the general cause of spreading that Opinion, I hop'd my inferiournesse in number would not be able to work me any great prejudice with those who fairly compar'd my advantages in other respects; espe∣cially if we remember the diligences perpetually us'd for im∣provement of Ecclesiastical Prerogatives; by advancing still favourable Tenets, and prohibiting the contrary; while the good Lay-Princes seldome provide so carefully for them∣selves; and where they do, such tender Doctrines grow ve∣ry slowly, and if they chane to take a little, yet, for want of depth, soon wither away.
Nor is my Party so few as not to be considerable: If three or four Doctors, nay perhaps One, who has well studied the Point, can make an Opinion safe; What may we say where a greater
 number of whole Universities engage their Judgements? Uni∣versities equal to the best in Europe, who on purpose studyed and disputed the Question, and having seriously ponder'd both what Popes had done, and Councils had defin'd, and all kind of Authors had written, at last unanimously conclu∣ded and decreed what this following Letter intends to repre∣sent.
When I was thus by Reason and Authority satisfied in my own mind, still there remain'd a Scruple to publish it; for though I suppose my self secure of a Truth, what have I to do, being a private Man, to tell it to others; especi∣ally Those who are infinitely more competent Judges than I? But as again I beg your Counsel, let me again tell you my condition; I observ'd, that most of the Persons, from whom we might expect such discourses, were either diverted by o∣ther imployments, or for particular considerations unwilling to meddle with This: On the other side I consider'd how ex∣cellent a Charity it were to be the occasion of setling clearly so important a Doctrine, that we might hang no longer be∣tween Heaven and Earth, God and Cesar, sustain'd only by the slippery running-knot of Probability, which will be fast or loose, as the Casuist pleases, especially if the Wri∣ters endeavours should be blest with so happy successe, as to give the least contribution towards the attainment of a more condescending Form of Oath; wherein, the manner of ex∣pression being a little chang'd, every syllable of the Sub∣stance might entirely be retain'd; many of the better-tem∣per'd Refusers being observ'd to scruple more at some Phrase, than at any Thing in the Oath.
This strongly carryed me to wish the Work done; but my own unqualifiednesse extremely discourag'd me from doing it: At last, seeing my Independence on any (as to particu∣lar expectations) was a Circumstance very suitable to such an undertaking, and in very few to be found, my thoughts weary of strugling one with another, sat down and rested, upon this Conclusion, That to propose my Sense by way of Quaeres could not be esteem'd presumptuous, since e∣very fool has wit enough to ask Questions, and I have left for others, the Wise man's part, to answer them.
