GENTELMEN,
IF to violate Faith (though but with Infidels)
we forfeit not only our Reason, but Reli∣gion;
so not to dedicate some part of my
Experiments to your Ingenious Society, might
justly prohibit me the freedom of tracing your
flourishing Fields and fragrant Meadows, ina∣mel'd
with Flowers, that perfume the beautiful
Suburbs of Trent; upon whose delightful Banks
I formerly used to spend some solitary Hours,
in pursuit of the scaly Fry, and where the Plen∣ty
and sweet Situations invited me not only to
contemplate, but improve this mystical Art of
Angling: though it's true, the Rudiments (in
the minority of Youth) were laid in Cam; yet
Silver Trent's orient Streams graduated my ju∣niour
Experiments, by unfolding her Meanders,
and making obvious the Intrigues of her rapid
Fords, replenished with variety; nay so great
variety of Fish, that only to express it would
almost bring Truth into Suspicion; when from
the more profound and solitary Deeps, the Ar∣tist
(if expert) may summons up Lucit, and
the generous Race of Salmon.

But, Gentlemen, I am not Angling now, I'm
only telling you those original Motives to this
solitary (and Piscatorian) Science, that grew
up with me when an Adult; for then I courted
the shady Streams of Cam; but Trent (as I told
you above) gave me Education. To Trent
therefore (and the Place of my Nativity) I di∣rect
my Influences, let Malice do its worst; nor
are they extravagant Notions, nor broken Frag∣ments,
collected from Foreign nor Domestick
Authority, but lineal and practical Experiments
and Demonstrations, drawn up and cultivated
by the Mediums of Art, and the exact Methods
of Observation; which without vanity, I de∣dicate
to your Society inhabiting the flourishing
Ports of Nottingham; which I doubt not you'l
accept of, though not much to inrich you;
however you may taste of those solitary Hours
laboriously spent in Great-Britain's Hellespont,
(the famous Trent) where I used to refresh my
self, and ramble up and down her delightful
Fords, to gratify and satisfy others as well as
my self with the Fruits of Experience. So that
should I call Sea and Land Elizium, it's not al∣together
improper so to do, since Earth and
Water compleat but one Globe.
In those florid Fields, near the Fords of Trent,
I frequently wandred up and down to crop the
Buds of Experience; yet I plundred no Man's
Orchard to enrich my Arbory, nor borrowed I
other Mens Labours to adorn my Discoveries:
the Bounty of Heaven, that always blest me
with benevolent Success, restrained me from
rifling the Records of my Ancestors; when

to put a Rod in my Hand, and place a River
before me: so that I should offer Violence to
Reason and Art, if now to consult the Autho∣rity
of others, when such a large and legible
Folio to write by, as the great and stupendous
Volume of the Creation; which to contemplate,
interprets the Divine Practice of Solitudes, and
becomes not only contributary to the present,
but the future Generations.
To study Contemplation is the high way to
Heaven, where the Suburbs consist of a Divine
Composition, and where you may read by those
Oracles the Stars, the beautiful Order of Ce∣lestial
Bodies, and the great and lesser World
all Harmony; for Heaven and Earth are Corre∣lates,
which duly to contemplate, poises our Pas∣sion,
and baffles our Pride; which necessarily
pursues the Foot-steps of Generation, as natu∣rally
as Rust follows Copper, which without
dispute is the Death of the Compound; conse∣quently
Tradition, if penitentially admitted,
and Ignorance opposed to the Mediums of Art;
there uncultivated Arts present no Dispon∣dencies,
nor need a Man solicite Reality in Pra∣cticks.
But this I oppose, and confidently assert,
he that licks up the fabulous Fiction of slip∣pery
Authority, to confirm his false and unte∣nable
Position, brings unsound Arguments to
prop and support the slender Faith his Opini∣on
leans on; whereby he exposes himself to
Clamour and Reproach, and the Censure of
every judicious Examinant.
Give me leave therefore to remonstrate my
Resolution, since the Arguments and Allega∣tions

in my Book are my own. Yet had I
rob'd Virgil to adorn my Muse, peradventure
my Fancy had been more fruitful; but take it
as it is, since so freely dedicated to the Vir∣tuosos
of the Rod, from whom in modesty I
may reasonably expect some charitable Cen∣sures
of this my Sober and Contemplative
Angler; advising them to direct to the Gno∣men
of Practicks, omitting Theory, and the
useless Prescriptions of the Antients. Then
shall no Man need to grope the Invention of
others, but manifest every Truth by plain
Demonstration. Thus far I may safely sail
under the Angler's Protection: but should
I write Marginal Notes, and place them to
the Test of unpractical Anglers, beyond dis∣pute
I should split on a Rock, and wanting a
Pilot to bring me off, I might live without
Hope, and die in Despair; which I resolve
against, whilst capable to write my Name,
