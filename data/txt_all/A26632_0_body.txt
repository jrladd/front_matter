YOu are to take
this Translati∣on
very Kind∣ly,
for the Authour
of it has ventur'd his
Reputation to Oblige
you: Ventur'd it
(I say) even in the

very Attempt of Co∣pying
so Nice an
Original. It is, in
French, one of the
most Artificial Pieces
perhaps of the Kind,
that is any where Ex∣tant:
Beside the Pe∣culiar
Graces, and
Felicities of that Lan∣guage,
in the Matter
of an Amour, which
cannot be adopted
into any other
Tongue without Ex∣tream

Force, and Af∣fectation.
There was
(it seems) an Intrigue
of Love carry'd on
betwixt a French Offi∣cer,
and a Nun in
Portugal. The Cava∣lier
forsakes his Mis∣tress,
and Returns
for France. The La∣dy
expostulates the
Business in five Let∣ters
of Complaint,
which She sends af∣ter
him; and those

five Letters are here
at your Service. You
will find in them the
Lively Image of an
Extravagant, and an
Unfortunate Passion;
and that a Woman may
be Flesh and Bloud, in a
Cloyster, as well as in a
Palace.
