A worke in nature not vnlike to our Survayes in Ireland, that re∣present most liuely, vast Countries within a small Map. I offer this to you, hauing hereto∣fore

giuen you an account of those seruices that I haue lately done in the survay of Ireland, you being Survayor Generall of that King∣dome, wherein I haue spent the most part of thirtie yeares, in the seruice of my Prince and Countrie, Tam Marte quam Mercurio, both with Pike and Pen, with great toyle, much hazard, and many hurts, but little profite. Notwithstanding your demerits and worth be such, as Gratitude hath chosen your Pa∣tronage: and Deuotion wisheth all honor, health, and happinesse to you, to my good Lady, and to yours.
