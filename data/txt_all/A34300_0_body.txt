Madam,
A Clear Wit, sound
Judgment and a
Merciful Dispo∣sition,
are things so rare∣ly
united, that it is al∣most
inexcusable to en∣tertain
them with any
thing less excellent in

its kind. My know∣ledge
of you were a
sufficient Caution to
me, to avoid your Cen∣sure
of this Trifle, had
I not as intire a know∣ledge
of your Good∣ness.
Since I have
drawn my Pen for a
Rencounter, I think it
better to engage where,
though there be Skill
enough to Disarm me,
there is too much Ge∣nerosity
to Wound;

for so shall I have the
saving Reputation of an
unsuccessful Courage,
if I cannot make it a
drawn Battle. But me∣thinks
the Comparison
intimates something of
a Defiance, and savours
of Arrogance; where∣fore
since I am Consci∣ous
to my self of a
Fear which I cannot
put off, let me use the
Policy of Cowards and
lay this Novel unarm'd,

naked and shivering at
your Feet, so that if it
should want Merit to
challenge Protection,
yet, as an Object of
Charity, it may move
Compassion. It has been
some Diversion to me
to Write it, I wish it
may prove such to you
when you have an hour
to throw away in Read∣ing
of it: but this Sa∣tisfaction
I have at least
beforehand, that in its

greatest failings it may
fly for Pardon to that
Indulgence which you
owe to the weakness of
your Friend; a Title
which I am proud you
have thought me wor∣thy
of, and which I
think can alone be su∣periour
to that
