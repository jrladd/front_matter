Right Honourable,
THe fame of your Honours most excel∣lent and praise-worthy indeuours in attempting, following, and applying of a Plantation of some of our English Na∣tion in that remote, and yet obscure, and desolate Countrie, the Country commonly called New∣foundland, hath encouraged and emboldened me, a stranger to your Honour, but a well-willer to all such worthy workes, to present vnto your Honour, and to publish vnder your Honours Name, some part of my plaine and impolished Labours, which for the furtherance and hasting on of those most worthy, and at this present for our Countrie of England, most necessarie attempts of Plantations in farre and forraine parts, but specially and namely in Newfoundland, aboue the rest, I haue aduentured

to offer to the common view, in hope and desire somewhat thereby to moue and stirre vp our peo∣ple, chiefly the poorer and meaner sort, (which, for want of Plantation abroad, are ready, by want and penurie, to pine and perish at home) in better sort to affect and addict themselues to the same.
Which worke of mine, though rude and meane, if your Honour shall, in consideration of the mat∣ter and substance thereof vouchsafe to accept, and thinke not vnworthy of Passage abroad, as it shall notably protect my Labours from the enuious mindes of the malicious, and the carping tongues of the captious, so shall it stirre vp my selfe with all heartie affection, to rest deuoted to your Honours seruice and these employments, and to poure out my deuoutest praiers to the Highest, the Lord of all, for your Honours all and euer health and happi∣nesse.
