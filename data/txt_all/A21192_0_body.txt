Right Honourable.
THe deepe ob∣ligations that your Honors many favours have already bound mee in, and my gratefull in∣clination to an expressi∣on of them, engage mee
to the tender of this humble present. It is not cloathed with any abili∣ties worthy your eye, but if you please to cure the defects by a noble accep∣tation, you make mee e∣ver as much yours as this was mine, before I presum'd to owne it on so honourable a Pa∣tron. Pray take my weake labours and with it mee; I have my aime if it bring to your honor
as much comfort, as it carryes from me zeale; and God grant that you may gleane something out of this short Ser∣mon that may be as high as my desires for your salvation. Let me say to this as the Poet said to his
Hei mihi quod domino non licet ire tue. But there is no obscu∣rity, no dangers, or ad∣versity, that shall bee able to restraine my pray¦ers
for multiplying bles∣sings on your honour in all things externall, internall, eternall, That you may doe all things well, to the glory of God, benefit of your Coun∣try, comfort of your soule, and honour of your name, as shall still befit
