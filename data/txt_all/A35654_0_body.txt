Sir,
AFter the delivery of your Royal
Father's Person into the hands
of the Army, I undertaking to
the Queen Mother, that I would
find some means to get access to him, she was
pleased to send me, and by the help of Hugh
Peters I got my admittance, and coming well
instructed from the Queen (his Majesty
having been long kept in the dark) he was
pleased to discourse very freely with me of
the whole state of his Affairs: But Sir, I will
not lanch into a History, instead of an Epistle.
One morning waiting on him at Causham,
smiling upon me, he said he could tell me some
news of my self, which was that he had seen
some Verses of mine the evening before (be∣ing
those to Sir R. Fanshaw) and asking me
when I made them, I told him two or three



years since; he was pleased to say, that
having never seen them before, He was
afraid I had written them since my return
into England, and though he liked them
well, he would advise me to write no more,
alleging, that when men are young, and
have little else to do, they might vent the
overflowings of their Fancy that way, but
when they were thought fit for more serious
Employments, if they still persisted in that
course, it would look, as if they minded not
the way to any better.
Whereupon I stood corrected as long as I
had the honour to wait upon him, and at his
departure from Hampton Court, he was
pleased to command me to stay privately at
London, to send to him and receive from
him all his Letters from and to all his Corre∣spondents
at home and abroad, and I was fur∣nisht
with nine several Cyphers in order to
it: Which trust I performed with great safety
to the persons with whom we corresponded;
but about nine months after being discover∣ed
by their knowledge of Mr. Cowleys hand,



I happily escaped both for my self, and those
that held correspondence with me; that time
was too hot and busie for such idle speculati∣ons,
but after I had the good fortune to wait
upon your Majesty in Holland and France,
you were pleased sometimes to give me argu∣ments
to divert and put off the evil hours of
our banishment, which now and then fell not
short of your Majesties expectation.
After, when your Majesty departing from
St. Germayns to Jersey, was pleased freely
(without my asking) to confer upon me that
place wherein I have now the honour to
serve you, I then gave over Poetical lines,
and made it my business to draw such others
às might be more serviceable to your Maje∣sty,
and I hope more lasting. Since that
time I never disobeyed my old Masters com∣mands
till this Summer at the Wells, my
retirement there tempting me to divert
those melancholy thoughts, which the new
apparitions of Forreign invasion, and dome∣stick
discontent gave us: But these clouds
being now happily blown over, and our Sun



cleerly shining out again, I have recovered
the relapse, it being suspected that it would
have proved the Epidemical disease of age,
which is apt to fall back into the follies in
youth, yet Socrates, Aristotle, and Cato
did the same, and Scaliger saith that Frag∣ment
of Aristotle, was beyond any thing
that Pindar or Homer ever wrote. I will
not call this a Dedication, for those Epistles
are commonly greater absurdities than any
that come after, for what Author can reaso∣nably
believe, that fixing the great name of
some eminent Patron in the forehead of his
book can charm away censure, and that the
first leafe should be a curtain to draw over
and hide all the deformities that stand be∣hind
it? neither have I any need of such
shifts, for most of the parts of this body
have already had Your, Majesties view,
and having past the Test of so cleer and
sharp-sighted a Iudgment, which has as
good a Title to give Law in Matters of this
Nature as in any other, they who shall pre∣sume
to dissent from Your Majesty, will do



more wrong to their own Iudgment, then
their Iudgment can do to me: And for
those latter Parts which have not yet recei∣ved
Your Majesties favourable Aspect, if
they who have seen them do not flatter me,
(for I dare not trust my own Iudgment)
they will make it appear, that it is not with
me as with most of mankind, who never
forsake their darling vices, till their vices
forsake them; and that this Divorce was
not Frigiditatis causâ, but an Act of Choice,
and not of Necessity. Therefore, Sir, I shall
only call it an humble Petition, that Your
Majesty will please to pardon this new amour
to my old Mistress, and my disobedience to his
Commands, to whose memory I look up with
great Reverence and Devotion, and making
a serious reflection upon that wise Advice,
it carries much greater weight with it now,
than when it was given, for when age and
experience has so ripened mans discretion as
to make it fit for use, either in private or
publick Affairs, nothing blasts and corrupts
the fruit of it so much as the empty, airy



reputation of being Nimis Poeta, and there∣fore
I shall take my leave of the Muses, as
two of my Predecessors did, saying
Splendidis longum vale dico nugis,
Hic versus & caetera ludicra pono.
