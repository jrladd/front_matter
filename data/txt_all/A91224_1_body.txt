THat neare relation wherein now you
stand
By Habitation, and a Nuptiall Band,
To Seas, and Sea-men; did at first inâˆ£duce
Me to digest this SEA-CARD for your Use,
And his you most esteeme; which in some sort
May helpe conduct you unto Heav'ns blest Port,
The onely Haven which you now most Eye,
And strive for to arrive in when you dye.
Accept it therefore (though scarce worthy view,)
As a small pledge of his Respects to you,
Who much adores your Vertues, and must deeme
His Muse too meane to adde to your esteeme.
