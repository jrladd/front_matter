Noble SIR,
JNGATITUDE being a sin, which not only Men, but Divels ab∣hor, I could not, durst not forbear the publishing of my Thankfulness for former, though Malice hath for present rendred me uncapable of fu∣ture Favours, lest Posterity should rank me among those ingrateful wretches that are unthankful unto such, as have been bountiful unto them. Necessity then obligeth me to this Publike Manifestation of the Thankfulness of my heart to you, for those many expressions of Bounty and Goodness, which my hand hath received from You. But what are Verbal Thanks in respect of Real Courtesies? Yet God himself (in whose place somtimes You sit, and in whose stead You Act) telleth us plainly, That a man is accepted according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not. Accept then I pray You this humble and hearty acknowledgement of your Worships Re∣al and Ready Favours, and suffer it to lie by You, as a lasting Monument of Your due deserved Praise, and
 my just acknowledgements of Your Worth: And now seeing I can serve You no longer, as I desire, give me leave to Bless You before I go. The Bles∣sings of the Bed, and of the Board; the Blessings of the City, and of the Country; the Blessings of the Sea, and of the Land; the Blessings of the Basket, and of the Store; the Blessings of Heaven and Earth: in a word, all Blessings that were ever showred down upon Mortals, be upon You and Yours, Your Ver∣tuous Consort, Your Hopeful Issue, Your Well∣ordered and Religious Family: And so Praying rests
