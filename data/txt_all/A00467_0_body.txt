ACcept good Cousin, a small token of my loue: value not the heart according to the greatnes of the gift; onely taste and trye, and you shall finde it, though small, yet not altogether fruitlesse, especially if after tryall you trust and make vse thereof. Your kinde accep∣tance of this shall be a meanes to be∣get
 a better: So wishing Gods grace and blessing to you and all your righteous endeuours I rest,
