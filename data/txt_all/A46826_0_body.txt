SIR,
THO' I readily complied with your Request in preaching this Sermon, yet I was, for many Reasons, very unwilling to print it, notwithstanding you were pleased, by several very obliging Messages, to desire it. But after long Deliberation and Advice, I adventure to publish, and present it to you, intreating your candid Acceptance. The manner of handling this excellent Subject, is, I confess, very mean and defective, but the Occasion whereon it was preached very noble and commendable. Such large and useful good Works must not be concealed or under∣valued,
but published in the World to the Glory of God, the Encouragement of others, and the due Praise of such worthy Bene∣factors.
The good Lord preserve your Life and Pro∣sperity, to rectify and compleat what you may find inconvenient or amiss in your pious and ample Charity both at Feckenham and Bromsgrove, and also to accomplish your greater Designs for the Publick Good. That these your Good Works may effectually advance the Glory of God, and the Good of Mankind, together with your own deserved Honour in this World, and your eternal Happiness in the World to come, is the hearty Prayer of
SIR,

Evesham, Novemb. 20. 1697.
