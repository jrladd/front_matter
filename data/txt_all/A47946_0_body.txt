Madam,
WHen greatness is maintained and attended with all those Gifts and Talents which procure it ecteem and respect, when Persons of the highest Rank and Quality are more illustrious by their Merit than their Fortune, it is no wonder if the World flocks to them with Offerings, and that their excellencies procure them some∣times trouble and importunities instead of ease and sa∣tisfaction. All those who have the Honour to know you, Madam, speak even with that veneration of your Lady∣ship, that I could not curb the Ambition I have of ad∣ding one voice to the general shout, and from crowding up to your Feet, with this present. It is a Presumption, Madam, I should have despaired of ever having been able to have attoned for, had not this story of the Queen of Majorca met with that approbation in the World,
that it has been found capable of entertaining with de∣light the greatest Judges, amongst whom your Ladyship being with justice acknowledged to have the first Place, this Queen fancyed she could be no where so safe as un∣der so glorious a Protection, and therefore was restless and impatient, till I had Ʋshered and Introduced her into your Ladyships presence. I shall have fully satisfied my vanity, if you find her Company, Madam, as agreeable as others have done, and if you can think fit to Pardon the dress she appears in, which I'm afraid will be found to have too much of the French in it, and I in this a too Superstitious observer of their Mode. But should I excuse my self with her being huddled up in haste, I should but prove the more importunate; Nor shall I tell the World that Honour, Wit, and Vertue, have never had a better Example than your Ladyship, it would be I fancy like a Man in the Month of May or April, who in a clear, bright, Sun-shining Day, ha∣ving a fair Prospect of all the Beauties Nature was ever capable of bestowing, and which were adorned by all manner of improvements, would declare to the World that it was Spring; and Figure to himself he had discovered a great secret, in publishing what was already the general delight, Admiration and Wonder: he could not fail of being similed at for his folly, which to avoid, it is sit that I be silent in a Subject that is above description, that I make my Legg, and retire with all Submission and Respect.
Madam,
