EXpound Tabithai, and tis Dorcas name,
And Dorcas is a Roe-bucke sharpe of eye:
In this respect Tabithai wonne her fame,
That from the earth her soule did pierce the skie.
By faithes pure worke true graces quallity,
Her mortall life wonne immortality.


Is there none like Tabithai? God forbid,
Yes some there are, but of those some too fewe:
Many make shew, but doe not as she did,
But giue me leaue to giue your deeds their due.
Many haue faith, no workes, their faith is vaine:
Your workes approoue Tabithai liues againe.
