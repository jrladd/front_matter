Noble Sir,
COntentions have been great and high of old, and still are so, about the equality or inequality of the Son of God with the Father, even to the Anathematizing one the other, when both that is a truth that the Arrians and the Arminians hold, viZ. That the Son is less then the Father; and that which the Protestants hold is no less a truth, viz. that the Sonne is equall with the Father: which being un∣derstood and observed according to the mind of God, is holy and good: but men exceeding in dimi∣nishing the Sonne in his Essence, and exalting him in his emanation, the truth being hid is the cause of the controversie, and men have thereby come to subvert the faith of many.
The greatest, the grossest, and yet the most subtil way thereto, hath been laid of late by Mr. John Bid∣dle, in that book of his, called, The Apostolical and true Opinion concerning the holy Trinity revived; which the
 sooner I have wrote against, because from the year 1647. he gloryes no man of the many learned he hath contested with, hath given an answer to one Argument satisfactorily; yea, and that he hath long waited on the learned for an answer, and can receive none: That he hopes some one will; and that him∣self is in the case a doubting Spirit, and so a man convinceable, and not to be rejected: from all which, with the bond of the Gospel, that tyeth me to contend for the faith, I am induced to commend this insuing Treatise to the World, and first to you; to whom I acknowledge my self and mine to owe very much, and to God for you who I believe will not fail to satisfie your laying out, from the least Cup of water, to the greatest good you do for his: to whom I com∣mend you to be kept for ever, being as I am bound to be
 September 20. 2653. I first viewed Mr. Biddles book about Sept. 3. 1653
