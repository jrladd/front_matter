MADAM,
I Have heard, and may therefore say, I know your Character, for I have still been told the same by every Body, You are above being Titularly Noble; your Vertue is the true Nobility. 'Tis not for me to attempt your Encomiums; for all the Actions of your Life have given you, and shall give you praise. The easie greatness of your Temper, your courteous Affability, your Generosity, your Charity, your Good∣ness, and your Piety, have Universally

spoke your Character. Your Vertues are your Historians and your Poets; and 'tis thro' them the Memory of your Name shall live, thro' them,  well as thro' your Chil∣dren, who by their Happy Education shall stand the admirable Copies of their bright Original.
On you, Madam, I have fixt, as the Patroness of these Poems, you who are all Vertue, and all Goodness, can best defend them from the Censures of detracting Tongues; your Name prefix'd to them, must in it self protect them; for none will imagine I should presume to Play the Li∣bertine, when I approach the Temple of Diana. The following Stories are out of Ovid's Book, Intitled Metamorphosis, the best, as well as the Chastest Poem he has writ; and how far soever I have fail'd in transfusing his Poetry into the English Language, I dare be positive he has lost nothing of his modesty by my Translation; for I consider that whatever off'ring is lay'd Chastly at your Feet, you will not Spurn: This, Madam, Courts Modestly your Ac∣ceptance,

without the least Impurity, with∣out Flatt'ry; so much I truly Honour and Esteem you for your Illustrious Character, that I have even Dedicated to you, without a Complement, for I am sincerely, with all due deference and respect, your Vertue's Just Admirer, and,
Madam,
