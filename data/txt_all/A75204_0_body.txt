May it please your Grace,
THE following Letters con∣tain some general remarks of what happen'd in the English

Fleet, that was sent to the Mediter∣ranean toward the letter end of the last War; with some observations of the posture and disposition of the Spanish Nation as it then stood. The Account is not so particular as it might have been, I wish some∣thing more had been said of the History and Politicks of that Peo∣ple, that it might have been more seasonable for this present juncture, when the eyes of all the World are pointed to that Empire: But to make amends for that Omission, I take every thing in it to be very justly describ'd, most of it having occur'd to my own experience, and to the Knowledge of all the Curious in that Voyage: And as I can af∣firm the Account to be just, so there is little or nothing said that ever has been mention'd by any other Au∣thor.
I have form'd it into a Book for your Graces perusal, and am happy that I can lay it at your feet in a time when your confinement at home by a troublesome pain, and sometimes your want of Company gives you leisure to read it over: And tho' I know your Graces Palate to be exceeding Nice in all sorts of reading, yet I am not more discou∣rag'd at that, than I am animated with your Goodness and Indul∣gence.
The opportunities I have had of your Conversation were very fortu∣nate to me: by them I had the Ho∣nour of being known to your Grace; By them I have been pre∣sent at some of the Politest Dis∣courses that I have met with, and by them I have, of consequence, refin'd my own Capacity; and I can't chuse but say, I was astonisht

to hear the first Peer of England, whose Nobility has been of late years less Curious of these finer Studies▪ talk so well. My next thought was, (may my Lord par∣don me) that if the Duke of Nor∣folk were stript of all his Titles, and cou'd come upon the Square to converse with such as me, there is not a Man on earth whose Society I shou'd so much covet: But in the pleasure of that thought I forgot my distance, not considering that Nature, as well as the scituation of your Birth, had put so great a Bar betwixt you and me, that like the Sun, you can't be look'd at, but with the Clouds between. My Lord, I was born with an antipathy to flattery, and I hope, I have said nothing that can be so understood; I'm sure I wou'd avoid it if I knew where it look'd like it, but in your

Graces Character, 'twould be hard to say too much, and it is the World's unhappiness not to know you as well as I do.
I am at a loss, My Lord, how to acknowledge the Honours I have already receiv'd, and nothing but your Permission cou'd make me sin again by laying this trifle under your Patronage: but when I consi∣der'd the Curiosity your Grace has for Books, and the particular in∣quiries you made of the Country here mention'd, I thought I had a fair occasion of putting your Name before this, which I hope will give you some satisfaction: I wish it were in my Power to cover some∣thing better than this Imperfect Ac∣count with your Illustrious Pro∣tection, but 'tis the Debtor's curse to be always in Arrears, and I don't know how to offer your Grace any

thing that will not want a blush to hide it: But your Grace is often exercis'd in Acts of Clemency, and 'tis but the habit of your Goodness to Pardon. The Contemplation of that Vertue gives me unspeakable pleasure, therefore with the greater assurance I address this Book, and with profound humility remain,
