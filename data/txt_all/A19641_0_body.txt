I Am not ignorant (Right Hono∣rable and right worshipfull Se∣nators) of the custome of this age, which is, that such as write bookes do vse to dedicate thē to some worthy persō or other, vn∣der whose protection they might passe with more safetie from the byting of the enuious: so that many times a light discourse is grac't with a iudiciall censor: I was therefore imboldned to obserue the same Method, and that chiefly because I know true Vertue loueth whatsoeuer is like it selfe be it neuer so little, and accepteth what is zealously offered, though not alwayes deseruingly excellent, whē base deiected minds want wisedome & experience to direct the pu∣ritie

of iudgement. And although I haue scatte∣red here and there some iarring notes and harsh consonants, vntunable to a modest eare: yet the vglines of vice made me striue to paint out her lanus-face to the eye of the world. Alexander re∣fused not a cup of colde water at the hands of a silly begger, the poore widows myte was more accepted then the abundance of the Scribes and Pharises, for she offered all that she had, they of their superfluitie: so a noble mind doth alwaies patronize a poore gift as willingly, as it is de∣uoutly dedicated. If in like sort your bounties wil deign to giue free admittance to this home∣ly worke, I shall be prouoked not to end with this my rude beginning, but striue to shewe some greater monument of my loue heereaf∣ter. And thus leauing to trouble your wise∣doms with tedious circumstance, I rather abre∣uiate of that I would say, then by speaking too much to breed suspitiō of my simple well mea∣ning. And so I humbly commit your affaires to the good guidance of the Almightie, and my selfe to your fauourable censures.
