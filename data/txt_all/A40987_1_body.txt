Right Worthy Sirs;
THe words of a Minister must not onely be commoda, profitable to the Auditory, but accommoda, suitable to times and occasions. This necessity surprized these hasty thoughts, which your benignity conceiving to have some availe against the distempers of these times, and of this Citie, have importuned abroad.

As I have ever thought my labours unworthy the Presse, so my selfe have been ever unwilling to publish any thing, that may not finde a roome to stand up in the study, contrary to that Greek proverb,. A great book, a great evill; for if the subject be good, the bulke can be no burthen: I might have been so hap∣pie, to have left something unto posterity, had not the unhappie plunder of these times snatcht from me twenty yeares labours in the Ministery. Whilest nature shall yet fanne a little breath into my nostrills, I shall indeavour not to be found idle, nor un∣fruitfull in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
Mean time, my deare friends, your respective importunities have prevailed for a let passe unto these unpolished notes, and if I cannot as yet compasse richer gifts, to cast into the Churches Treasury, the Lord, I know, disdaineth not mites. If I might be any way serviceable to God, or to his people in this weake in∣deavour, as it is the end of your desire, so it is the reward of his labour, who is a faithfull Zelot to the wellfare of Jerusalem. And
