My Lord;
IF an Averseness to appear in Print, and a Con∣scious Fear of exposing my slender Performances to publick View, might have pleaded my Excuse, I had not troubled your Lordship with an Address of this Nature. But since your Lordship will have me Publish what I would much rather had been kept private, I hope your Honour will pardon my prefix∣ing Your Name to that which claims a Right to Your Patronage, and I am sure wants your Protection.
In Passions of Grief, (especially of Affectionate Sor∣row) things are at once more easily, and more deeply impress'd on our Minds; and when the Affections are warm, they soon entertain a Fondness for that which is grateful to them. I have reason to suspect some of my Auditors of such a kind Partiality, and too fa∣vourable a Representation of what they heard delivered upon that unwelcome Occasion, which might byass your
 Lordship into a good Opinion of, and a Desire to see, what a Passionate Concern, and Surprizing Sor∣row would not allow you to hear.
This makes me lay it at your Honours Feet with an entire Submission to the Result of your Judicious Perusal, and better Thoughts; having no other De∣sign in tendring it to Your View, than to testifie my willingness to comply with your Lordships Request, and a readiness to pay any Service that I am capable of rendring to your Self, or Right Honourable Family.
That which I reckon my self most happy in, is the Opportunity I have hereby of acknowledging the Ob∣ligations I have to the House of Dunham, and the Respect I always found from that obliging Generosity, which seems Hereditary to Your Family, of which I shall always covet to be thought a true Honourer, and hope your Lordship will Accept this Small Te∣stimony of my Gratitude, and believe me to be what I sincerely am,
My LORD,
