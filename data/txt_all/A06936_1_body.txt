I Haue heere presumed (Right Honourable, right Worshipfull, and most worthy Gentle∣men) to present vnto your hands this small Treatise, being a Worke long by mee thought vpon, long by many of my dearest friends vrged vpon, and now I hope (to th glory of God and my Countries profit) in a good and prosperous houre brought foorth to be lookt vpon: The Liuory it weares is Truth, the reward it seeks

is triall and experience, and the full ayme at which it bends is the generall good of all good men, whose painefull industries makes them the Masters, Fathers, and Nurses of the best Knowledges.
Ignorance, Wealth, and Ease may hold sleight of the argument, but that Wisdome and Experience which hath runne through the test of Affliction, will say it is worthy and necessary: for it will feed the hungry, cloath the naked, and giue soft rest to the wea∣ry; it will appease Mutenies, breede Loue, and make men able euery way to doe and suffer.
Being then so good in it selfe, and so glorious in others, to whom can I bet∣ter prefrre it then to your worthy goodnesses, whose pyous and religious hearts, ayming to reduce an Infinie number of yet lost soules to the pos∣session of the true heauenly Hierusa∣lem, haue already kindled the glori∣ous

Star of example in the South, which doubtlesse giueth that certaine promise of neuer to be extinguisht Sunneshine, that men which are now lyuing, Babes sucking, and Infants yet vnborne, shall trauell as holy Pylgrimes to your mo∣numents, to admire and praise your vertues. To the Treasurie of that a∣ction of Plantation, loe, I bring this my poore mite, and offer it to your seruice, which if you shall please to accept, I doubt not but the benefit shall returne to those in your imployment a reuenue worthy their practise; and my selfe rest euer ready to doe you and my Countrey Seruice.
Geruase Markham.
