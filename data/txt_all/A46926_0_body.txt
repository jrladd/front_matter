AS it hath, Right Honourable, of late pleased your most Noble Brother in kindness to ac∣cept of this History, and to grace it with a favourable Countenance; so am I now en∣boldned to Dedicate the Second Part unto your Honour, which here I humbly offer to your Lord∣ship's Hands, not because I think it a Gift worthy the Re∣ceiver; but rather that it should be, as it were, a Witness of the Love and Duty which I bear to your Right No∣ble House.
And when it shall please you to bestow the Reading of these Discourses, my humble Request is, That you would think I wish your Honour as many happy Days as there be Letters contained in this History.
Thus praying for your Honour's chief Happiness,
