IT is now full. 7. yeeres (as you can well remēber) since I
first attempted the translation of Andria into Eng∣lish verse,
being thereto partely inci∣ted by your meanes: But afterward perceiuing what
difficultie it was, to enforce the pithie and prouerbiall sayings of
Terence into Rime, and withall what inconuenience grew, by reason of
diuers seuerall Speakers, sometime seuerally happening, within the length
of one line or lesse: I playnely saw, that such manner of forced
translation, must needs be both harsh and vnpleasāt to the Reader, and
also not halfe seemly besitting the sweete style and eloquence of the
Author. So as hauing thus transla∣ted the whole Comoedie in verse (sauing
the two last leaues) my paines bestowed therein did somuch mislike me,
as that euer sithens yt lay by me, vtterly neglect∣ted, and neuer fully
finished: Tyll that now of late, being by some, much requested to make
common the same, for the benefit of such as studie the latin: I haue
therevpon somwhat altered my cours, and indeuored to turne it into prose,
as a thing of lesse labour in show,  and more libertie in
substance, seeming withall, most accordant, with this Comicall kinde of
writing. And bicause I am not ignorant, with what ardent loue, and liking,
you haue alwaies, most studiouslie embraced all good Authors: (being of
your selues, euen naturally in∣clined, to all learning and knowledge:) I
cannot ther∣fore, but recomēd to your fauour, this peece of Terence,
bearing the frame of my poore workemanship: which I desire you, at idle,
and vacant times, to vouchsafe to peruse, both for Terence sake,
whom I am sure you loue: And also at my request, whom I know you do not
hate. And so I commit you to the most gracious Protection of the
Highest.
