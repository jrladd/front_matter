Honored SIR,

THe Series of your favours did invite
Mine unfleg'd Muse, to take a sudaine flight,
On Peg'sus wings, 'twas that which did infuse
A quickning life into my dying Muse.
Can Helicon want lucid streames! can I
Be dry of matter, you Mecenas by?
I hate to be ungratefll, if I should
Not make a verse the Rocks and Mountains would:
The squestration of two hours time
From serious Studies, I imploy'd in Rhime.
Yet Nothing went about, with what I drew
From Nothing, Nothing, I present to you.

 Dress'd in a rude, yet in a sober, stile,
Hoping you will at my endeavours smile.
You hate (as wel as I) these dang'rous times,
To cast your eyes on vaine and wanton Rhimes.
And I could gladly spend my flitting dayes
In penning Sonnets to my makers praise.


To your protecting wings I therefore fly
For shelter: ah! but when my serious eye
Darts on your worth, and on my selfe looks down,
I feare the wrath of a condemning frown.
Juditious Sir, if that you please t' affect
These embrio-lines 'tis more then I expect.
But yet, I know your candour wil excuse,
Since 'tis an ev'ning, not a morning muse.
I crave not praise, but pardon. I have got
Mountaines of praise if you disdaine me not.


O may you live unto grand Nestor's day
With silver age, and honor cown'd: so prayes
Your humble servant, whose unboud dsire
Is Phenix like, to burne in duties fire:
Whose life's too smal to hazard for your ease,
Sir, I am yours, command me when you please.


Wickham-brooks June 5, 1657.
