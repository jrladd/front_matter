WORSHIPFVLL,
The consideration of the dutie which euery Christan is in Conscience bound to performe, name∣ly, To aduance the glory of God by whom he was created, and vpon whom he wholy dependeth;
and also to further the good of his Bro∣ther the Image of God, and fellow mem∣ber with him of the same misticall bodie of Christ, compelled me to take in hand the Translation of these two Sermons following, as being the good which I (hauing opportunitie of time and place to accomplish) might in no wise omit. They were first preached and published in the Netherlandish Dutch, for the bene∣fit of the people of God in those parts, which being also my desire in this place, I according to my slender ability haue tran∣slated and published them here; and as a token of the respect I beare vnto your worth, and of the thanks I owe vnto you for the many fauourable fruites of your loue, am bold to tender them vnto your acceptance, and commit them vnto your Patronage.
They may fitly be tearmed the Anato∣mizing of the body of sinne, a touch stone for a Christian, or, a Receipt for a sicke soule, for they (ioyntly) containe matter suting vnto these three titles, and vse full for all sortes of men, as well those that have a name to be a∣liue
but are dead, hauing a shew of Religion, but want substance; as those that are Christians indeed, and in truth, Whose prayse is not of men but of God.
But being loath to be too troublesome vnto you with abundance of words, I re∣ferre you vnto the booke it selfe, which (being iealous of mine owne errors and insufficiencie, I submit vnto your judici∣ous censure) euer consecrating my selfe vnto you for your seruice in all that I am or shalbe able to performe, and my pray∣ers vnto God for your safetie and protec∣tion in bodie and soule: and thus I hum∣bly take my leaue,
