TO Thee, whose Worth hath doubl'd good-hopes Cape
Thrice in high pleasures Seas, I send this Toy,
To mocke such Apes (or Beasts in humane shape)
As giue vs cause of laughter, and annoy.


Her's Wit too ranke, sith sprong from too much soyle;
Whereat such Apes as but Saintes counterfet,
Do mop and mox; good sport, in sport, to spoile,:
But, iustest lerkes their wry-mouths right shall set.


If some Lines broader bee, than long, herein,
(To make the lash (with laughter) lowd ech blow)
It is, broad Faults to scourge with greater dyn,
To feare, much more than hurt, offenders so: (grieue,
Then when (deare Lord) great cares your greatnes
Laugh at these Ierkes (like Greatnes) in your sleeue.
