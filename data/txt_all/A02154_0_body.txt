RIght beautifull and bountiful La∣dy,
finding my selfe humbly de∣uoted
to the Right honourable
the Lord Fitzwaters your hus∣band,
not onely that I am borne
his, but also for the gracious ac∣ceptaunce
of a small Pamphlet
written by an other, and presented to him by me,
I endeuored any way and euery way that I might,
to discouer my affectionate dutie to him by some
scoller-like labours that I began to tosse ouer the
first frutes of my witts wrapt vp as scollers treasurs
be, in loose papers that I might sift out some thing
worthie his honor, but finding all worthlesse of
his Lordship, at last I lighted vpon this fiction of
Venetian Philomela which I had writen long since
& kept charily being pend at the request of a Coun∣tesse
in this land to approue wemens chastitie,
assone as I had red it ouer and reduced it into
forme lickinge it a lyttle as the beares doe their
whelpes to bring them to perfection, I haue re∣solued
to make good my duty to his Lordship in
doing homage with my simple labours to your
Ladiship knowing seruice don to the wife is gratefi∣ed
in the husband) wherupon I presume to present
the dedication of chast Philomela to your honor
and to christen it in your Ladiships name, calling
it the Ladye Fitzwaters Nghtingalle as if I

should insinuate a comparison twixt you and him
of equall and honorable vertues. Imitating heer∣in
Maister Abraham France, who titled the Lamen∣tations
of Amintas vnder the name of the Coun∣tesse
of Pnbrookes Iuie Church: for heerein your
Ldyship had farre more perfections then yeres &
more inward excelence then externe beutie, yet so
beutiul as few so fair though none more vertuous,
I thought the legand of an honorable and chaste
Ladie. Would be gratefull to your honour whose
mind is wholy delighted in chast thoughts, keping
herein a perfect decorū to appropriat the nature of
the gift to the cōtent of the person. For such as offer
incence to Venus burn mirr mixed with Eringion.
Those that glory Pallas giue her a shield▪ Dians pre∣sent
a bow: witty poemes are fitt for wise heades
and examples of honor for such as triumphe in
vertue so that seing there hath few led more chaste
then an Italian Philomela I thought none only
more fitt to patronyse her honors then your Lady∣ship
whose chastety is as far spred as you are eyther
knowne or spoken of, yf then my well meaning
may not be misconstrued but my presumptiō par∣doned
and my labours fauered with your gratious
acceptation I haue what I aimed at and what I ex∣pected,
in the hope of which courtesie setting
downe my rest I humbly take my leaue.
