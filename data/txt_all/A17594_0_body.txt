O Exellent prince of my lyfe chefe patron
Medicyn to sycke mē in their gret distresse
To all nedy: both shelde and protection
Refuge to wretches their dommage to redresse
Men that ar halfe deed / restoring to quickenesse
Sith your grace of god was chosē to be so good
O exellent prince forgyue my offencesse
In thonour of god that bought you wt his blode


¶ Blacke is my wede / of cōplaynte & mournīg
As a man cast from all felycite
Lyke one of a funerall / bedewed with wepynge
Clad in the mantell of frowarde aduersyte
Trymblyng and quakinge / of my lyfe no surete
But if I drinke of your most mercyfull flode
Than shall I neuer offende / by your soueraynte
But saue that which god bought wt his p̄ciouse blode


¶ O myrrour of lyght / suffre nat to perisshe
Thy poore subiecte: but to his prayer enclyne
Whiche herafter thy lawes shall cherisshe
And kepe them as most holly and diuyne
Sith your grace hath ben treacle & chef medicyn
To other offendours which in myschef stode
Pardon me Salomō / I wyll obey thy doctryne
And saue ye which god bouʒt wt his p̄cious blod



¶ And for my parte / of one hert abidyng
Voyde of chaunge / and all mutabilyte
I do present this boke / with hande shakyng
Of hole affection / knelyng on my kne
Desyring the lorde / whiche is persons thre
By whose magnifycence we receyue all fode
That by your grace I may haue lybertye
And saue ye which god bouʒt with his p̄ci▪ blode


¶ For all my purpose combyned in to one
Of whiche this boke shall make mencioun
Is to voyde yll wede / and to take the good corne
As reason hath taught me by discretioune
Puttyng no trust in the whele of fortune
But in this dialogue cōprehend that {per}sons good
By grace and vertu may here contune
And saue ye which god bought wt his p̄cio{us} blode


¶ Go forth lytle boke for fere tremblynge
Pray the prince to haue on the pytie
Voyde of all picture / or of any connynge
To compyle any curyouse ditie
Causynge thy prince to take on the mercy
Pray god graunt his grace that died on the rode
To preserue his hye noblenes and magnanimite
And to be partaker of Christes precious blode.

¶ Thus endeth the supplication
