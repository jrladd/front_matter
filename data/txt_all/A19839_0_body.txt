SIR, the perticular fa∣uours I haue often tasted as Arguments of a grea∣ter loue, then any seruice of mine can deserue; Chalenge from me a larger debt of du∣ty and acknowledgement, then any en∣deuours of mine can by possibility ac∣quite: yet to instance a gratitude som∣what aboue my fortunes or ability; I haue aduentured to tender an humble

thankfulnesse, in presenting to your iu∣dicious view a Nouelty, which I pre∣sume will be as acceptable to your per∣ticular knowledge, as it is to the Chri∣stian world ingenerall: being the Con∣uersion and Baptisme of a lew, written formerly in sundry Languages, lately in French, and now by me Translated into English, which taske falling with∣in the compasse of my ablenesse to dis∣charge, I haue made bold vnder your protection to expose to the publique view, and in all humblenesse offer to your Patronage: that it may be some liuing (though sleight) testimonie, of that loue & duty which hath, and euer shall publish me to the world as I am in heart:
