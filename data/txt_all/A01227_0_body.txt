IF Amyntas found fauour in your gra∣cious
eyes, let Phillis bee accepted for
Amyntas sake. I haue somewhat al∣tered
S. Tassoes Italian, & M. vvat∣sons
Latine Amyntas, to make them
both one English. But Tassoes is Co∣micall,
therefore this verse vnvsual: yet it is also Pastoral,
and in effect nothing els but a continuation of aeglogues,
therefore no verse fitter than this. For such as generally mi∣slike
this reformed kinde of verse, as I spake before, so
I say stil, I neuer heard better argument of them than this;
Such an one hath doone but ill, therefore no man can doo wel:
which reason is much like their owne rymes, in condemning
the arte, for the fault of some artificers. For others, that like
well of the thing, but not of my peculier labour herein,
mine aunswere is the same it was: if there were anie penal∣tie
appointed for him that would not read, hee might well
complaine of mee that publish it to bee read: But if it bee in
euerie mans choyce to reade it, or not to reade; why then not
in mine also to publish or not to publish it? Hee that will,
let him see and reade; hee that will neither reade nor see, is

neither bound to see nor reade. If anie begin to reade, when
hee beginneth to take no delight, let him leaue off, and go no
further. If he folowe on in reading without pleasure, let
him neither blame mee, that did what I could; nor bee an∣grie
with the thing, which hath no sense; but reprehend him
selfe, who would continue in reading, without anie plea∣sure
taking.
