May it please your Grace, &c.
ALbeit our neighbouring Nations be surfeited, yet it is the Misfortune of this to be starved, through want of Municipal Laws, for securing the Subjects in their Rights, by known and fixed Statutes, and not leaving and exposing the same to the arbitrary Sentiments of Judges. And though for several Centuries ago, and even to this time, there have been reiterated Commissions appointed for revising of the Laws, which are made, and Correcting thereof, or enacting what new Laws were necessar and expe∣dient for the Good of the Leidges, yet the same have never hitherto taken effect, being neglected by these who were appointed, having no suitable Encouragement for their Pains upon that account: Likeas, Parliaments being only called for Emer∣gencies, requiring speedy dispatch, through the Weight of these Affairs, had not the conveniency to call for an Account of what was done by these commissionat, as said is. And it being the Custom, Interest and Prudence of Princes, to grafie their Subjects with such Laws at the opening of Parliaments, as may ease them of severe and penal Rigidities, imposed more by exorbitant Custom than by clear and positive Law, or material Justice and Equity, such as Escheats, Recognitions, Wards and Marriages, and the like, which belong to His Majesty, which little or nothing augment the Thesaury, and yet great Hardship upon the Subjects, by gifting to Donatars, who have screwed the same far beyond their due Limits, which are so , that there is no need of Instances, and which have much pre∣judged and vexed these who suffered thereby, and irritat them not only to Clamor against the same, but also the Government it self: For remeed whereof (in part) these following Overtures are offered to your Grace, and the Honourable Court of Parliament, which Natively center at you, not only in respect of your present Character, but also of your Interest and Quality, the first being equal to what ye can desire, and the last to what is here attainable, so that nothing remains for your Grace and the Honourable House, but to secure your selves by just and in∣violable Laws, which is now the proper Season, the Nation being in full and tran∣quil Peace; And in this you have for your Pattern, the great Emperor Justinian, who compiled the whole Roman Laws now extant, after he had made an end of Fighting, and subjugated the World to his Scepter, and by doing whereof, ye wll cure (at the least,) ease the Nation of some of its present Maladies under which it labours. I doubt not but others may address your Grace with Overtures, which may be both more necessar and material; And therefore I leave these to such as are more fit than I, Seing none omnibus unum est.
Quod placet hic spinas colligit ille rosas.
