My LORD,
SEing man can glory in
nothing, but in that
he is GOD's Image;
certainly, that must be
his most glorious state
wherein that Image is
most clearly seen, and this is solitude;
wherein his composed soul (like the smooth
face of the Ocean) represents, with much
advantage, this glorious image which the



unequal risings of stormy and aspire∣ing
waves of ambition do exceedingly
conceal. The heathen Poet Lucretius
describes the great perfections of the
Deity to consist in that it is,
—Privata dolore omni privatapericlis
Ipsa suis pollens opibus—
And Cicero upon this score confesses,
that the Philosophers life was of all
others most preferable, because of all
others, it approached nearest to that of
the gods. This, my Lord, invited
me to write this Discourse in it's fa∣vours;
which because I intended as a
bundle of rods, for whipping such as
were fondly ambitious, I did therefore
strip naked of these leaves and flourishes
of Eloquence, which by making them
more pleasant, could not but make them
less sharp. And if any tax me for send∣ing
this Book to publick view, from that
solitude which both it and I so much com∣mend;
my answer is, That either it will
convince these who read it, and then it
will gratifie that solitude which it hath
left; or else it will meet with censure and



disdain, and then it's fate will demon∣strate
how dangerous it is to gaud abroad;
to press which, is another of my great
designs.
I intend not really to depreciat such by
this Discourse as injoy Honours and Em∣ployment;
that design lyes as far out of
my road, as it is rais'd above my power:
but I intend by it to congratulate with
such as either undervalue them out of in∣clination,
or have lost them by accident;
and to discipline such unquiet humours,
as like powder, do, in blowing up them∣selves,
destroy all that is above them, or
resists their violent ascent: wherein, as
I obliege Philosophers, by complementing
the object of their complacency; So I
gratifie States-men, by reclaiming such
as are the ordinary object of their fears.
Neither should any thing in this Dis∣course,
which is picquant against those
Courtiers who have been rather great then
good, displease such as are both good and
great, more then it should displease a Gen∣tleman
of noble shapes and features, to see
a Painter draw another man (though of



the same species with himself) under all
the disadvantages that can be trac'd by
a deforming Pencile.
That I should choose your Lordship for
my Patron, is no act of virtue; because
your condition, as it stands circumstan∣tiat,
made you almost the only person who
deserv'd it at all, and altogether the per∣son
who deserv'd it most; for, being the
best Pattern for solitary persons, ye were
the person who deserv'd most to be the Pa∣tron
of solitude it self: especially, having
oblieged it so far, as to prefer it to that
rival against which it now disputes for
precedency; and prefer'd it, after it's
adverse party had been your old acquain∣tance,
and had offer'd to bribe you, for your
suffrage, with a purse heavy enough to
have weighed down a light spirit. Fear
not, my Lord, the want of fame (which
is the only thing that solitude is thought
to want) For, as the heathens resembled
it to a Maid, so it hath this of a coy Maid
likewise, that it courts most these who
seem most to undervalue it; and rarely
any person admires his own servants so



much, as it doth these who are stranger▪
to it. And great men have this loss,
that their superiors will not admire them,
as being less then themselves; their
equals will not, because they hate them;
nor their inferiours, because they envy
them, and do but too oft imagine that they
are opprest for feeding their luxury. That
famous rod which wrought so many mi∣racles
for others openly in Aegypt, did
never it self flourish till it was laid up in
the tabernacle, (according to their opi∣nion,
who will have both these to have
been one and the same) and the Dia∣mond
ceases not to enjoy a greater lustre,
though hid in the darkest corner, then
these pleasing blossoms do, which the
weakest breath of a storm will command
down from the highest branch upon which
they pearch. Fame then shall transmit
your name to posterity, as the Iews did
their embalm'd bodies which they pre∣serv'd
perfumed and odoriferous in se∣cret
and retired Grotts and Sepulchres;
whereas it will preserve that of more
publick persons, only as the Aegyp∣tians



did theirs, whom by exposing to
the open Sun, they kept as mummie, but
so black and parcht, as that it had been
better they had return'd to their former
ashes. But, though fame should not thus
gratifie you, yet virtue (who hath so few
deserving followers now, that it cannot
but pile up pyramids of favours upon such
as are) will recommend you to succeeding
ages, both to let see that she wants not
her Trophees even in this dotage of
the world (wherein she is not so de∣form'd
by age, as not to have charmes
strong enough to conquer such as deserve
her favour) and to engage others, by this
act of gratitude, to a dependence upon her.
And amongst her admirers, you, as one of
her Minions, shall have still all defe∣rence
paid you, by
