YOƲ have herein what you earnestly desired, and have truly deserved of me, the Sermon preached at the Fu∣neral of your deceased, and justly beloved Husband; and now at the instance of his near Friends, made more publick: and their desires had been sooner complied with, but that it pleased God by a fit of sickness to hinder me, and thereby it, from coming sooner abroad. His life was a better Comment on the Text, than any I could make. He was such an Original, as did (as Originals usually do) exceed the Copy; so that I lay claim herein not to your thanks, but to your pardon: And for
that too I have no other plea, but that you commanded me to shew my weakness. But though I fell short in the Application, I may fear I have exceeded in the Discourse it self, having added much that was pre∣pared, but could not be then delivered, by reason of the straitness of time allowed to such occasions. That you may receive spi∣ritual advantage, and comfort by all, you have, together with the Sermon, the hearty constant Prayer of,
St. Sepulchres, Jan. 28. 1678/9.
Madam,
