Most Excellent Soueraigne:
HAuing attained vnto some cer∣taintie of the scope and mea∣ning of the Re∣uelation, and of the Mysteries
thereof, by earnest prayer, per∣vsing of Expositors, and con∣ference of the Prophesies ther∣of, with the Ecclesiasticall Histories; and being desirous to inlighten others, I haue cō∣piled, in as briefe and easie manner as I could deuise, the true scope and meaning of the same, and of euery Mysterie thereof: And being well as∣sured, that as God gaue vnto the Kingly Prophet Dauid a rich measure of his Spirit, so he hath bequeathed vnto your Highnesse most abundantly, his holy Ghost: so that none more knoweth the minde of Christ then you Maiesty doth.
Which imboldened me to de∣dicate this my Worke vnto your Highnesse, most hum∣bly crauing, that this little shew of my dutifull loue vn∣to your Maiestie, may obtaine pardon for my too much boldnesse: so, as it is my boun∣den dutie, I will neuer cease to offer vppe supplications vnto God and vnto Iesus Christ, for the dewe of his Spirit to be daily distilled in∣to your Royall heart, for your direction, and that God would alwayes charge his ho∣ly Angels for the preseruation of your Maiesties person, and of our most gracious Queene,
our most Royall Prince, and all your Highnesse Kingly Progenie.
