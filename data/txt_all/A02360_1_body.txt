IT is said of Apelles, (a
most cunning Pain∣ter)
that after he had
painted and appointed
any peece of worke, to be exhibited
to a publike view in any open place,
vsed to lurke priuily behinde the
same himselfe, to heare the diuers
and dissonant opinions & censures,
which the passrs by vsed, and did

pronounce of his picture; and wil∣ling
to satisfie their curious & cap∣tious
natures, withall vsed to ex¦cuse
himselfe by vnder writing so,
Apelles faciebat, (not fecit). If
Apelles therefore in his age, sole
and most expert in his arte, vsed
neuer to expone any picture to
publike view, without shrowding
himselfe (as it were) both with his
bod and this forenamed excuse,
from the captious tongues of the
multitude; verily the vse of patro∣nage
in these our daies, wherein so
many of carping Zoilus, & taxing
Momus liueth, is not onely cu∣stomable,
but also altogether neces∣sarie,
who verifieth the Prouerbe,
Quot capita, tot sentētiae, & quā
varia ora, tam varia Iudicia, and
are busie to be pulling out the mote
out of their neighbors eies, not cōsul¦ting
with  Nosce
te ipsum, to take the beame first ot

of their owne. Therfore it is (right
Worshipfull Trinarie) that leauing
the Viper to the file, & hos ardeli∣ones,
;
yet this time I haue presumed to
shrowd and couer this little Trea¦tise,
vnder the sheild of your bene∣uolence
and fauour, offering and
dedicating these small and vnwor∣thy
labours of a young man, concer∣ning
a young mans direction in his
life, according to Gods word, with
the hands and heart of all humility,
dutie, and affection to you, the yong
branches and happy of-spring of so
noble a stocke, whose roote so to fa∣sten
& establish in the land where∣in
hee liueth with honour, and
in the land of the liuing for e∣uer,
that the worme of his enemies
may neuer preuaile to make any of
the least of his branches to wither
or decay, but they may euer spread,
and more and more flourish in all

godlinesse, honour, & blessednesse:
I pray almighty God, to the glory of
his name, his Churches comfort,
and the posterities happy memorie;
perswading my selfe, that as in all
heartie and vnexpressible loue,
(my conscience bearing mee wit∣nesse)
I present the same vnto your
Worshippes, till God enable mee
more to expresse my deuotion: so
also you will graciously accept
thereof, respecting rather the in∣ward
affection of the heart dedi∣cating,
then the outward thing by
it dedicated; as also assuring my
selfe, that Ionas was neuer better
guarded vnder the shadow of his
greene and tender Gourd, from
the offensiue heate of the scorching
Sunne; Vlisses neuer thought
himselfe more safe, when hee did
hold the weapon of noble Achilles
in his hand; nor Iole daughter to
King Euritus, more feared when

she did stand armed with the wea∣pon
of valiant Hercules: then I
shall be safe and secure, vnder the
shadow of your protection, and
refreshing wings of your Worships
fauour, resting and reposing
my selfe with my
labours.
