Adde but an A, to Romanize your Name,
ANOTHER PALLAS is your Anagram:

(videlicet)

MARIA NEVILA.
ALIA MINERVA.



MAdame, your loue to learning and the learned,
(In such an Age, so full of Art's neglect)
Right worthily to your rare Selfe hath earned
The loue of learning and the learned sect;



Whereby, your Name already is eterned
In MEMORIE's faire TEMPLE hie erect:
And there, deuoutly at your VERTV's Shrine,
J humbly Offer this poore MITE of mine.



Too small a Present to so great a GRACE,
And too vnworthy of your Worthinesse:
Saue that the Matter so exceeds the Masse,
That oft (perhaps) a Greater may be lesse:



For, you may see, within this little Glasse,
The LITTLE-WORLD's Great-Little-Mindedâˆ£nesse.
Man's strife with Man: our Flesh & Spirit in Duel:
Couragious-Cowards, too Self-kindely-cruel.



Vouchsafe t' accept then this small New-yeres-Gift,
With th' humble Vowes of a dis-Astred Muse,
That lauishly hath sow'n her seeds of Thrift
So high and drie that yet no Fruit ensues;



Els need she not haue made so hard a Shift,
Nor this Small Gift so greatly to excuse:
But, sith (as yet) she cannot what she would,
Madame, accept her Zeale, and what she could.
