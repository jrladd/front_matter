Gentlemen,
THIS Sermon was Preached upon a very
Good Design, and at Your Request;
and the same Reasons have prevailed
with me to make it Publick. Which is all the Apo∣logy
I think my self obliged to make for it. Whether
or no the many Excellent Discourses that have al∣ready
come abroad upon This and the like Occasions,
have awakened mens Zeal, 'tis certain there is a
very Publick Spirit of Charity now among us.
The Generous Examples of the Members of your Cha∣ritable

Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy,
have not, 'tis probable, been a little instrumental
to that purpose. The breeding up of Poor
Children to Industry, to a true sense of Re∣ligion,
and particularly in the Doctrines and
Worship of the Church of England, is one of your
great Designs; and God be thanked, You have had
in this Noble and Ancient City, and in other Places,
very many Followers. By this means you may
hope to raise the Honour, and promote the Interest
of our Church, and to secure to your selves
those Blessings which will always attend the En∣couragers
of such Honourable and Pious Underta∣kings.
I am,
GENTLEMEN,
