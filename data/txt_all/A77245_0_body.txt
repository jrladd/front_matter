SIR,
If I pretended to compose a complete treatise upon this subject, I should not refuse those large recruites of reasons and autho∣rities, which offer themselves to serve in this cause, for God and man, Religion and Poli∣cy, Church & Common-wealth, against the blasphemous, despe∣rate, and destructive opinion of
 fatall destiny. But as mine aim, in the first discourse, was onely to press home those things in writing, which had been agi∣tated between us by word of mouth, (a course much to be preferred before verball confe∣rences, as being freer from pas∣sions and tergiversations, less subject to mistakes and misrela∣tions, wherein paralogismes are more quickly detected, imperti∣nencies discovered, & confusion avoided.) So my present intenti∣on is onely to vindicate that dis∣course, and together with it, those lights of the Schooles, who were never sleighted, but where
 they were not understood. How far I have performed it, I leave to the judicious and unpartiall Reader, resting for mine own part well contented with this, that I have satisfied my self.
