WHen I lay at Pinchfield (where I had more leisure and fewer Bookes than I could haue wished, I composed this Selah or Collection of those ver∣ses in the booke of Psalms Which the Holy Ghost maks remarkable with this word of attention Selah. VVhich verses I haue set together not accor∣ding to the order of the psalmes from whence they be taken, but according to the correspōdency of matter which the verses themselues contein, conside∣red with verses adioiyning. Out of whch, I somtimes take so much as may make the sense of the verse wherein Selah is more euident to the purpose where∣vnto I apply it. The word Selah I vnderstand in euey verse saue onely in one; In which I expresse it, because the Spirit hath set a double mark vpn that. This collection written I gaue for a Newyears gift to you for whose sake especially it was cōposed. But now, in consideratiō of the calamities of these times it is imprin∣ted, that I may bestow it vpon mo then your selfe: For such is the communion of Saints, in the fellowship of the Spirit, that the feelings o the whole Church, and of euery member, be alike, & therefore doth the Spirit in sundry Psalmes, speake both plurally and singularly of one and the same subiect▪ yea▪ sometimes in one and the same verse. Receiue eft-soones this composed Selah, as a token of my remembring the kindnesse which I haue receiued from you and your friends, and shew how you esteeme it, by making some good vse thereof. Fare-well.
