MY LORD,
WIthout leave I presume to prefix Your Lordship's Name to this Discourse. That it was Preach'd, I my self stand ac∣countable; but that it was Printed, It has Nothing to justify it but Your Lordship's Com∣mand, whom nothing can or do's resist. For the greatest Obscurities of the Law, Its most sullen difficulties scatter before Your Lordship's Eye, as the Clouds before the Sun. The most
intricate knotty Cases, You untye with that Ease and Dexterity, as that they seem of them∣selves to open. It is not in You to cut or force, It consists not with that sweetness of Temper, by which You so charm all You have to deal with, as that You seem most deservedly to in∣herit that Glorious Title of the Great Vespa∣sian, of being the Darling of Mankind. For the very Curse of the Law You manage with that Tenderness and Indulgent Affection, as even that the Condemn'd go away satisfied, if not pleas'd. That I might not therefore appear the only stubborn Thing in Nature, I submit, and subscribe my Self,
My Lord,
