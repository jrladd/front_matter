HONOR attend thy gratious Maiestie,
Blisse be her Partner, in thy Soueraigntie:
Though Dayes are yet young, olde Ioyes wil hast▪
When fearefull times, are dateles, deade and gone▪
Thy gouerning hand, that neuer yet knew other▪
Then a Rulers equall suckt from thy faire Mother.
Whose carefull thoughtes, in thee by Gods commaunde,
Hast from thy Childe-hoode, helde a happie hande.
By which fayre hand, Gods grace hath led thee hither,
To plant thy peace, plenty and grace together:
So as our Tryumphs, glorious be in showe,
So Tryumph-like, Ioy may with quiet goe.
That both in one, and one both wayes may be,
A double Ioy, in this Solempnitie.
So Tryumph sings this song of Ioy and Mirth,
King IAMES live happie, happiest on the Earth:
That God all seeing, may so blesse thy Lande,
That seeing all, may all thy evils withstande.
