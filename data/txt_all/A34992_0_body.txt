Right Honourable, Right Worshipful;
I Really blush to ap∣pear in a work of this Nature, lest some put the gloss of Arro∣gancy upon my En∣deavour: but the Spunge where∣with I shall wipe off this Staine,
 is, by letting such know, That I was obliged in duty to the Au∣thor; a piece of which will be, to perform what I know would have been his will, even bequeath this his VVork to you, upon whom he never thought his Labour ill be∣stowed. Besides, the Book being Motherless, it pitied me it should be Fatherless too; and therefore I thought it better to run the hazard of a harsh censure, then that this poor Orphane should be exposed to the wide World, without either Fa∣ther or Mother to fawn upon it. I should not have presumed to have troubled you with the Tuition of this Child, but that I know you did Reverence and Respect the Au∣thors Person; and therefore I hope
 will smile upon this his VVork. Besides, as you are Magistrates, you are Defenders of the Faith, and therefore (I hope) will not re∣fuse to defend this, so agreeable to the Faith once delivered to the Saints. I need not say any thing in the behalf of this Treatise: though it be but young, newly come into the World, I doubt not but it's sufficient to speak for it self. One Paradox (Indeed) I find in it: The Author writes against Usury; and none improved his Talent more then he; yet no contradicti∣on: his Usury was not biting: the improvement of this Talent was not to the detriment, but advantage of others: the Church of God, I hope, will be improved by that
 improvement he hath made. And that your Honour and your Wor∣ships may reap some benefit to your Souls by this his Labour, shall be the real Prayers of him,
