A True and Exact Relation of the
Proceedings of the Petitioner James Carol, in
discovering the Treasonable words, spoke by
one Thomas Allin, and unjust Prosecution
used by the Earl of Clanriccard against the Pe∣titioner
for the same, to the Petitioners Da∣mage
above 1000 l. already; tending not only
to the Petitioners utter undoing, if not spee∣dily
Relieved by your Majesty, but likewise
to the discouragement of all Loyal Subjects,
from discovering the like Treasons hereafter.
