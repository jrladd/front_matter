 if not borne out by your Noble and worship∣full Tutelage, for which I have chosen each of you as my Mecaenas, countenancers of lear∣ning and industry; I shall not need apologise for my selfe; your names of honour pleads my pardon for your owne honours sake; and you Right worshipfull, think it an act of most wor∣ship to patronize and pardon, remembring the old said sawe, posse, nolle, nobile: I know you have power to frowne, but to abstaine is truly noble; wherefore adventuring to stand to your severall doomes, who are able to Iudge of all disadvantages, either of sexe or want of learning, I take leave and rest,
