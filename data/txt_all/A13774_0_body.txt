MOst mighty and renowmed King, behold, I offer to your Maiesty these vnexpected and vntimeous letters, wherein the fine and pure gold of Saba, is mingled with the olde and corrupt drosse of Egypt, to be tryde by the diuine touchstone of your sacred wisdome, per∣swading myselfe, that the reading of them shal not be so picasant to your Maiesties eares, as the dis∣contentment, in beholding the sudden fall, and mise∣rable Apostasie of so great a personage, and of my knowledge, so greatly deuoted to your Maie∣sties seruice: besides that great hope and expecta∣tion, which was had throughout all France of him, to be (one day) a helpe and comfort to Christs true Church there. I may here very well compare him to the folly of the Lark, which, while it playes with the feather, and stoopeth, is caught in the Fowlers net: so he, dallying in his youth & prime of yeres,

being deceyued by the beautifull feathers & glas∣ses of pleasant Italy, was caught by the char∣ming intisemēts of those Antichristian Vipers, with whose venome being once stung, hard was it to find such medicine, for the cure of so dāgerous a discase: not doubting in this mean time, but as your Maiesty would be glad to heare of his healing and rising againe to the imbracing of the truth, from whence he fell: so likewise on the other part, I am fully perswaded, that your Maiesties wonted care shall continue in this your newe Monarchy, that no person of any quality and marke here∣after, shall bee licenced to trauell, especially to Spaine & Italy (places most dangerous for practi∣sing of treasons, & betraying of their own soules; yea, the liues of their owne Kings and countries) but with such a strict caueat, that if they continue not constant in the profession of the truth, wherin they haue bin taught, that at their returne, They shal expect the rigor of your lawes, to be executed against them more seuerely then heretofore haue bin, lest by their ouersight and daily increase, they may not onely indanger Christes Church in your dominiōs, but also your Maiesties person & state, which God forbid should euer come to passe in this our age, or in any other following. I craue humble pardon, that remēbers other mens matters

to your Maiesty, in forgetting my self; for charity should begin at her selfe, praying in all submission, that this small mite of mine may be receyued with that accustomed fauour (which sometime I in∣ioyed more liberally,) as your Maiesty vseth to accept the rich treasures of others dayly of∣fered to your Maiesty, and this to bee but the earnest of a better worke to follow, and a remem∣brance of my dutifull affection, humbly submitting my selfe, and this my rude Translation, to the royal & most learned censure of your Maiesty, who can far better iudge therof, then I haue deliuered it. I make an end, beseeching the Almighty King of Kings, long to preserue your Maiesties life, & to prosper all your good actions and godly enterpri∣ses, to his glory, to the comfort and good of the Church and Common-wealth.
