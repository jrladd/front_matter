HAaving lately an Occasion that
called me into the Country about
a small Affair, relating to a
Member of your Company, I there ac∣cidentally
had an opportunity to behold the
Great Houses of Charity belonging to
your Corporation; amongst the rest, I vi∣sited
two Almes-Houses, and two Schools,
in which Schools I found many expert

and witty Boyes, and very oppertunely
came to be a Spectator of a Play Acted
by the Boyes of one of the Schools, which
was performed beyond belief, for such
Actors whose business is not Playes; and
then beholding the good Order and Me∣thod
of the Government of the Schoole
and Almes-Houses, and the decent provi∣sion
for the Poor; and then reflected back,
and beheld the Sterne that guided them,
(which are you Worthy Gentl men) and
there I found not onely your Care to pre∣serve
the Ancient and Noble Acts of
Charity of your Predecessors, even in the
worst of Times, but observed your great
Industry, Wisdom, and Discretion in ma∣king
Additions daily for the relief of your
Poor, and adding greater strength to your
Corporation, as you lately have done by
renewing your Charter; nor are you onely
prudent amongst your selves, but are thought

fit Ministers to be intrusted by State of
a great Branch of his Majesties Revenue,
which is so discreetly managed, that your
Burden is thought light, to former Ʋn∣dertakers;
and that Clamour hath seased,
which was wont to be heard in the Streets.
And such is your Loyalty, that in great
straits, who more ready are to advance
Money from your thriving Banks; nei∣ther
can I forget your former Activeness
to advance the Kings Restauration, when
by your Politick and hazardous Ʋnder∣taking,
you stopt all the Excise Duty, which
was the ruine both of Lambert, Army,
and Committee of Safety, which pur∣chased
a Prison to some of you, and
others great trouble; but I fear I am
to blame to undertake to sifter out your
Worth, and therefore onely beg the fa∣vour,
that your Boyes may accept my Piece
of Play, which is the first that ere I writ,

and being near Christmas Holidaies, I
hope their Master will give them leave
to Act it; until my other Play be finished,
which is now on the Stocks, and will be quick∣ly
Printed, until then I take my leave, and
subscribe my self,
