My Lord,
IN this great Storm which hath dasht the Vessell of the Church all in pieces, I have been cast upon the Coast of Wales, and in a little Boat thought to have enjoyed that rest and quiet∣nesse, which in England in a greater I could not hope for: Here I cast Anchor, and thinking to ride safely, the Storm followed me with so impetuous violence, that it broke a Cable, and I lost my An∣chor: And here again I was exposed to the mercy of the Sea, and the gentlenesse of an Element that could neither distinguish things nor persons. And but that he who stilleth the raging of the Sea, and the noise of his Waves, and the madnesse of his

people, had provided a Plank for me, I had been lost to all the opportunities of content or study. But I know not whether I have been more preser∣ved by the courtesies of my friends, or the gentle∣nesse and mercies of a noble Enemy: . And now since I have come ashoar, I have been ga∣thering a few sticks to warm me, a few books to entertain my thoughts, and divert them from the perpetuall Meditation of my private Troubles, and the publike Dyscrasy, but those which I could ob∣tain were so few and so impertinent, and unusefull to any great purposes, that I began to be sad upon a new stock, and full of apprehension that I should live unprofitably, and die obscurely, and be forgot∣ten, and my bones thrown into some common char∣nell house, without any name or note to distinguish me from those who only served their Generation by filling the number of Citizens, and who could pre∣tend to no thanks or reward from the Publike, be∣yond a jus trium liberorum. While I was troubled with these thoughts, and busie to find out an oppor∣tunity of doing some good in my small proporti∣on, still the cares of the publike did so intervene, that it was as impossible to separate my design from relating to the present, as to exempt my selfe from the participation of the common calamity; still halfe my thoughts was (in despite of all my diversions and arts of avocation) fixt upon and mingled with the present concernments: so that besides them I could

not goe. Now because the great Question is concer∣ning Religion, and in that also my Scene lies, I re∣solved here to fix my considerations, especially when I observed the wayes of promoting the severall opi∣nions which now are busie, to be such, as besides that they were most troublesome to me, and such as I could by no meanes be friends withall, they were also such as to my understanding, did the most appa∣rently disserve their ends whose design in advancing their own opinions was pretended for Religion: For as contrary as cruelty is to mercy, as tyranny to charity, so is warre and bloodshed to the meeknesse and gentlenesse of Christian Religion: And how∣ever that there are some exterminating spirits who think God to delight in humane sacrifices, as if that Oracle—, had come from the Father of Spirits, yet if they were capable of coole and tame Homilies, or would hear men of other opinions give a quiet account without invincible resolutions never to alter their perswasi∣ons, I am very much perswaded it would not be ve∣ry hard to dispute such men into mercies and com∣pliances, and Tolerations mutuall, such I say, who are zealous for Jesus Christ; then whose Doctrine never was any thing more mercifull and humane, whose lessons were softer then Nard, or the juice of the Candian Olive: Upon the first apprehension, I design'd a Discourse to this purpose, with as much greedinesse as if I had thought it possible with my Arguments to have perswaded the rough and hard handed Souldiers to have disbanded presently: For

I had often thought of the Prophecy that in the Go∣spel, our swords should be turned into plowshares, and our Speares into pruning hooks; I knew that no tittle spoken by Gods Spirit could return unperform'd and ineffectuall, and I was certain, that such was the ex∣cellency of Christ's Doctrine, that if men would obey it, Christians should never warre one against ano∣ther; in the mean time I considered not, that it was praedictio consilii, non eventus, till I saw what men were now doing, and ever had done since the heats and primitive fervours did coole, and the love of inte∣rests sweld higher then the love of Christianity; but then on the other side, I began to fear that whatever I could say would be as ineffectuall, as it could be reasonable: For if those excellent words which our blessed Master spake, could not charm the tumult of our spirits, I had little reason to hope that one of the meanest and most ignorant of his servants could ad∣vance the end of that which he cals his great, and his old, and his new Commandement, so well as the excellency of his own Spirit and discourses could. And yet since he who knew every event of things, and the successe and efficacy of every Doctrine; and that very much of it to most men, and all of it to some men would be ineffectuall, yet was pleased to consign our duty that it might bee a direction to them that would, and a conviction and a Testimony against them that would not obey, I thought it might not misbecome my duty and endevours to plead for peace and charity, and forgivenesse and permissions mutuall, although I had reason to believe

that such is the iniquity of men, and they so indispo∣sed to receive such impresses, that I had as good plow the Sands, or till the Aire, as perswade such Doctrines, which destroy mens interests, and serve no end but the great end of a happy eternity, and what is in order to it. But because the events of things are in Gods disposition, and I knew them not, and because if I had known my good purpo∣ses would be totally ineffectuall as to others, yet my own designation and purposes would be of advan∣tage to my selfe, who might from Gods mercy ex∣pect the retribution which he is pleased to promise to all pious intendments; I resolved to encounter with all Objections, and to doe something to which I should be determined by the consideration of the present distemperatures and necessities, by my own thoughts, by the Questions and Scruples, the Sects and names, the interests and animosities which at this day, and for some years past have exercised and disquieted Christendome.
Thus farre I discourst my selfe into imployment, and having come thus farre, I knew not how to get farther, for I had heard of a great experience, how difficult it was to make Brick without Straw, and here I had even seene my design blasted in the bud, and I despaired in the Calends of doing what I pur∣posed in the Ides before: For I had no Books of my own here, nor any in the voisinage, and but that I remembred the result of some of those excellent Discourses, I had heard your Lordship make when I was so happy as in private to gather up what your

temperance and modesty, forbids to be publick, I had come in praelia inermis, and like enough might have far'd accordingly. I had this only advantage besides; that I have chosen a Subject, in which, if my own reason does not abuse me, I needed no other books or aides, then what a man carries with him on horse-back, I meane the common principles of Christianity, and those  which men use in the transactions of the ordinary occurrences of ci∣vill society; and upon the strength of them and some other collaterall assistances I have run through it utcunque, and the sum of the following Discour∣ses, is nothing but the sense of these words of Scripture;
That since we know in part, and prophesy in part, 1 Cor. 13. and that now we see through a glasse darkly, wee should not despise or contemn persons not so know∣ing as our selves, but him that is weak in the faith Rom. 14. we should receive, but not to doubtfull disputations; Therefore certainly to charity, and not to vexati∣ons, not to those which are the idle effects of im∣pertinent wranglings. And provided they keep close to the foundation, which is Faith and Obedience, let them build upon this foundation matter more or lesse precious, yet if the foundation be intire, they shall be saved with or without losse. And since we professe our selves servants of so meek a Master, and Di∣sciples of so charitable an Institute, Let us walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called with all lowlinesse and meeknesse, with long suffering, for∣bearing Ephes. 4. 2, 3. one another in love; for this is the best en∣deavouring

to keep the unity of the Spirit, when it is fast tyed in the bond of peace. And although it be a duty of Christianity, that we all speak the 1 Cor. 1. 10. same thing, that there be no divisions among us, but that we be perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgement, yet this unity is to bee estimated according to the unity of faith, in things necessary, in matters of Creed, and Articles fun∣damentall; for as for other things, it is more to be wished then to be hoped for; there are some doubtfull Disputations, and in such the Scribe, the Rom. 14. Wise, the Disputer of this world, are most common∣ly very farre from certainty, and many times from truth: There are diversity of perswasions in matters adiaphorous, as meats and drinks, and holy dayes, &c. and both parties, the affirmative and the negative, affirm and deny with innocence enough, for the obser∣ver and he that observes not, intend both to God; and God is our common Master, we all fellow servants, and not the judge of each other, in matters of conscience or doubtfull Disputation: And every man that hath faith must have it to himselfe before God, but no man must either in such matters judge his brother or set him at nought; but let us follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another: And the way to doe that is not by know∣ledge, but by charity, for knowledge puffeth up, but 1 Cor. 8. 1. charity edifieth; and since there is not in every man the same knowledge, but the conscience of some are Vers. 7. weak; as my liberty must not be judged of another 1 Cor. 10. 29. mans weak conscience, so must not I please my selfe so

much in my right opinion, but I must also take or∣der that his weak conscience be not offended or de∣spised, for no man must seek his own but every man Ibid, anothers wealth: And although we must contend ear∣nestly for the faith, yet above all things we must put on charity which is the bond of perfectnesse: And there∣fore this contention must be with arms fit for the Christian warfare, the sword of the Spirit, and the shield of Faith, and preparation of the Gospel of peace instead of shooes, and a helmet of salvation, but not with Colos. 3. 14. other armes; for a Church-man must not be , a striker, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnall but spirituall, and the persons that use them ought to be gentle, and easy to be intreated, and we must give an account of our faith to them that ask us with meeknesse and humility, for so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the igno∣rance of foolish men. These and thousands more to the same purpose are the Doctrines of Christianity, whose sense and intendment I have prosecuted in the following Discourse, being very much displeased that so many opinions and new doctrines are commenc'd among us, but more troubled that every man that hath an opinion thinks his own and other mens sal∣vation is concern'd in its maintenance, but most of all that men should be persecuted and afflicted for disagreeing in such opinions which they cannot with sufficient grounds obtrude upon others neces∣sarily, because they cannot propound them infalli∣bly, and because they have no warrant from Scrip∣ture so to doe: For if I shall tie other men to believe

my opinion, because I think I have place of Scrip∣ture, which seems to warrant it to my understanding, why may he not serve up another dish to me in the same dresse, and exact the same task of me to believe the contradictory: And then since all the Hereticks in the world have offered to prove their Articles by the same meanes by which true believers propound theirs, it is necessary that some separation either of Doctrine or of persons be clearly made, that all pre∣tences may not be admitted, nor any just Allegati∣ons be rejected; and yet that in some other Questions whether they be truly or falsly pretended if not evi∣dently or demonstratively, there may be considerati∣ons had to the persons of men and to the Laws of charity more then to the triumphing in any opini∣on or doctrine not simply necessary. Now because some doctrines are clearly not necessary, and some are absolutely necessary, why may not the first separation be made upon this difference, and Articles necessary be only urg'd as necessary, and the rest left to men indifferently, as they were by the Scripture indetermi∣nately. And it were well if men would as much con∣sider themselves as the Doctrines, and think that they may as well be deceiv'd by their own weaknesse, as perswaded by the Arguments of a Doctrine which other men, as wise, call inevident. For it is a hard case that we shall think all Papists and Anabaptists and Sacramentaries to be fooles and wicked per∣sons, certainly among all these Sects there are very many wise men and good men, as well as erring; and although some zeales are so hot, and their eyes so

inflamed with their ardors, that they doe not think their Adversaries look like other men, yet certainly we find by the results of their discourses, and the transactions of their affaires of civill society, that they are men that speak and make syllogismes, and use reason, and read Scripture, and although they do no more understand all of it, then we doe, yet they endeavour to understand as much as concerns them, even all that they can, even all that concerns repen∣tance from dead works, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ: And therefore me thinks this also should be another consideration distinguishing the persons, for if the persons be Christians in their lives, and Christians in their profession, if they acknowledge the Eternall Sonne of God for their Master and their Lord, and live in all relations as becomes persons making such professions, why then should I hate such persons whom God loves, and who love God, who are partakers of Christ, and Christ hath a title to them, who dwell in Christ, and Christ in them, be∣cause their understandings have not been brought up like mine, have not had the same Masters, they have not met with the same books, nor the same compa∣ny, or have not the same interest, or are not so wise, or else are wiser, (that is, for some reason or other which I neither doe understand, nor ought to blame) have not the same opinions that I have, and do not determine their Schoole Questions to the sense of my Sect or interest.
But now I know before hand, that those men who will endure none but their own Sect, will make all

manner of attemps against these purposes of cha∣rity and compliance, and say I, or doe I what I can, will tell all their Proselytes that I preach indiffe∣rency of Religion, that I say it is no matter how we believe, nor what they professe: But that they may comply with all Sects, and doe violence to their own consciences, that they may be sav'd in all Religions, and so make way for a colluvies of He∣resies, and by consequence destroy all Religion. Nay, they will say worse then all this, and but that I am not used to their phrases and formes of de∣clamation, I am perswaded I might represent fine Tragedies before hand. And this will be such an objection, that although I am most confident I shall make apparent to be as false and scandalous as the Objectors themselves are zealous and impatient, yet besides that, I believe the Objection will come where my answers will not come, or not be understood; I am also confident that in defiance and incurious∣nesse of all that I shall say, some men will persist per∣tinaciously in the accusation, and deny my con∣clusion in despite of mee: well, but however I will try.
And first I answer, that whatsoever is against the foundation of Faith, or contrary to good life and the lawes of obedience, or destructive to humane society, and the publick and just interests of bodies politick, is out of the limits of my Question, and does not pretend to complyance or toleration: So that I allow no indifferency, nor any countenance to those Religions whose principles destroy Govern∣ment,

nor to those Religions (if there be any such) that teach ill life, nor doe I think that any thing will now excuse from beliefe of a fundamentall Ar∣ticle, except stupidity or sottishnesse and naturall inhability. This alone is sufficient answer to this vanity, but I have much more to say.
Secondly, The intendment of my Discourse is, that permissions should be in Questions speculative, indeterminable, curious, and unnecessary, and that men would not make more necessities then God made, which indeed are not many. The fault I find and seek to remedy is, that men are so dogmaticall and resolute in their opinions, and impatient of others disagreeings in those things wherein is no sufficient meanes of union and determination, but that men should let opinions and problemes keep their own forms, and not be obtruded as axiomes, nor questions in the vast collection of the systeme of Divinity, be adopted into the family of Faith: And I think I have reason to desire this.
Thirdly, It is hard to say, that he who would not have men put to death, or punished corporally for such things, for which no humane Authority is sufficient either for cognisance or determination, or competent for infliction, that he perswades to an indifferency, when he referres to another Judi∣catory, which is competent, sufficient, infallible, just, and highly severe. No man or company of men can judge or punish our thoughts, or secret purposes whilest they so remaine, and yet it will be unequall to say, that he who owns this Doctrine preaches it

lawfull for men to think or purpose what they will. And so it is in matters of doubtfull disputation (such as are the distinguishing Articles of most of the Sects of Christendome:) So it is in matters intellectuall (which are not cognoscible by a secular power) in matters spirituall (which are to be discerned by spi∣rituall Authority, which cannot make corporall in∣flictions) and in Questions indeterminate, (which are doubtfully propounded or obscurely, and therefore may be in utramque partem disputed or believed;) for God alone must be Judge of these matters, who alone is Master of our souls, and hath a dominion over humane understanding, and he that sayes this, does not say that indifferency is perswaded, because God alone is Judge of erring persons.
Fourthly, No part of this Discourse teaches or en∣courages variety of Sects, and contradiction in opi∣nions, but supposes them already in being, and there∣fore since there are, and ever were, and ever will be variety of opinions, because there is variety of hu∣mane understandings, and uncertainty in things, no man should be too forward in determining all Que∣stions, nor so forward in prescribing to others, nor invade that liberty which God hath left to us intire by propounding many things obscurely, and by ex∣empting our souls and understandings from all power externally compulsory: So that the restraint is laid upon mens tyranny, but no license given to mens opinions, they are not considered in any of the Con∣clusions, but in the premises only as an Argument to exhort to charity. So that if I perswade a license

of discrediting any thing which God hath comman∣ded us to believe, and allow a liberty where God hath not allowed it, let it be shewn, and let the Objection presse as hard as it can; but to say that men are too forward in condemning where God hath declared no sentence nor prescribed any rule; is to disswade from tyranny, not to encourage licentiousnesse, is to take away a license of judging, not to give a license of dogmatizing what every one please, or as may best serve his turn. And for the other part of the Objection;
Fifthly, This Discourse is so farre from giving leave to men to professe any thing though they believe the contrary, that it takes order that no man shall bee put to it, for I earnestly contend that another mans opinion shall be no rule to mine, and that my opinion shall be no snare and prejudice to my selfe, that men use one another so charitably and so gently, that no errour or violence tempt men to hypocrisy, this very thing being one of the Arguments I use to perswade permissions, lest compulsion introduce hypocrisy, and make sincerity troublesome and un∣safe.
Sixthly, If men would not call all opinions by the name of Religion, and superstructures by the name of fundamentall Articles, and all fancies by the glorious appellative of Faith, this objection would have no pretence or footing, so that it is the disease of the men, not any cause that is mini∣stred by such precepts of charity that makes them perpetually clamorous: And it would be hard to say

that such Physitians are incurious of their Pati∣ents, and neglectfull of their health, who speak a∣gainst the unreasonablenesse of such Empericks that would cut off a mans head if they see but a Wart upon his cheek, or a dimple upon his chin, or any lines in his face to distinguish him from another man; the case is altogether the same, and we may as well decree a Wart to be mortall as a various opinion in re alioqui non necessariâ to be capitall and damnable.
For I consider, that there are but few Doctrines of Christianity, that were ordered to be preached to all the world, to every single person, and made a necessary Article of his explicite beliefe: Other Doctrines which are all of them not simply necessa∣ry, are either such as are not clearly revealed, or such as are: If they be clearely revealed, and that I know so too, or may, but for my own fault, I am not to be excused, but for this I am to be left to Gods judgement, unlesse my fault be externally such as to be cognoscible and punishable in humane ju∣dicatory: But then, if it be not so revealed but that wise men and good men differ in their opini∣ons, it is a clear case, it is not inter dogmata ne∣cessaria simpliciter, and then it is certain I may there∣fore safely disbelieve it, because I may be safely ig∣norant of it: For if I may with innocence be ig∣norant, then to know it or believe it, is not sim∣ply obligatory; ignorance is absolutely inconsi∣stent with such an obligation, because it is destructive

and a plaine negative to its performance, and if I doe my honest endeavour to understand it, and yet doe not attain it, it is certain that is not obliga∣tory to me so much as by accident, for no obliga∣tion can presse the person of a man, if it be impos∣sible, no man is bound to doe more then his best, no man is bound to have an excellent understand∣ing, or to be infallible, or to be wiser then he can, for these are things that are not in his choyce, and therefore not a matter of a Law, nor subject to re∣ward and punishment; so that where ignorance of the Article is not a sin, there disbelieving it in the right sense, or believing it in the wrong, is not breach of any duty, essentially or accidentally ne∣cessary, neither in the thing it selfe, nor to the per∣son; that is, he is neither bound to the Article, nor to any endeavours or antecedent acts of voliti∣on and choyce, and that man who may safely bee ignorant of the proposition, is not tyed at all to search it out, and if not at all to search it, then certainly not to find it: All the obligation we are capable of, is not to be malicious or voluntarily criminall in any kind, and then if by accident we find out a truth, we are obliged to believe it; and so will every wise or good man doe; indeed he can∣not doe otherwise: But if he disbelieves an Article without malice, or design, or involuntarily, or un∣knowingly, it is contradiction to say it is a sinne to him who might totally have been ignorant of it; for that he believes it in the wrong sense, it is his

ignorance, and it is impossible that where hee hath heartily endeavoured to finde out a truth, that this endeavour should make him guilty of a sinne, which would never have been laid to his charge, if he had taken no paines at all: His ignorance in this case is not a fault at all; possibly it might, if there had been no endea∣vour to have cur'd it.
So that there is wholly a mistake in this pro∣position: For true it is, there are some pro∣positions, which if a man never heare of, they will not be required of him; and they who can∣not read might safely be ignorant, that Mel∣chizedeck was King of Salem; but he who reads it in the Scripture, may not safely contradict it, although before that knowledge did arrive to him, he might safely have been ignorant of it: But this although it be true, is not perti∣nent to our Question; For in sensu diviso this is true, that which at one time a man may be ignorant of, at some other time he may not disbelieve: But in sensu conjuncto it is false; For at what time, and in what circumstance so∣ever it is no sinne to be ignorant, at that time and in that conjuncture, it is no sinne to disbe∣lieve; and such is the nature of all Questions disputable, which are therefore not required of us to bee believed in any one particular sense, because the nature of the thing is such as not to be necessary to be known at all simply and

absolutely, and such is the ambiguity and cloud of its face and representment as not to be ne∣cessary so much as by accident, and there∣fore not to the particular sence of any one person.
And yet such is the iniquity of men, that they suck in opinions as wild Asses doe the wind, without distinguishing the wholesome from the corrupted ayre, and then live upon it at a ven∣ture, and when all their confidence is built up∣on zeale and mistake, yet therefore because they are zealous and mistaken, they are impatient of contradiction.
But besides that against this I have laid pre∣judice enough from the dictates of holy Scrip∣ture, it is observable that this with its appen∣dant degrees, I meane restraint of Prophesying, imposing upon other mens understanding, being masters of their consciences, and lording it over their Faith, came in with the retinue and traine of Antichrist, that is, they came as other abuses and corruptions of the Church did, by reason of the iniquity of times, and the cooling of the first heats of Christianity, and the encrease of interest, and the abatements of Christian sim∣plicity, when the Churches fortune grew bet∣ter, and her Sonnes grew worse, and some of her Fathers worst of all; For in the first three hundred years there was no sign of persecuting any man for his opinion, though at that time

there were very horrid opinions commenced, and such which were exemplary and parallel enough to determine this Question; for they then were assaulted by new Sects which destroyed the common principles of nature, of Christia∣nity, of innocence and publike society; and they who used all the meanes Christian and Spiritu∣all for their disimprovement and conviction, thought not of using corporall force, otherwise then by blaming such proceedings: And there∣fore I doe not only urge their not doing it as an Argument of the unlawfulnesse of such pro∣ceeding, but their defying it and speaking against such practises, as unreasonable and destructive of Christianity: For so Tertullian is expresse, Hu∣mani Ad Scapulat. juris & naturalis potestatis, unicuique quod putaverit colere, sed nec religionis est cogere re∣ligionem, quae suscipi debet sponte non vi: The same is the Doctrine of S. Cyprian, Lactantius, S. Hilary, Minutius Felix, Sulpitius Severus, S. Chrysostome, S. Hierom, S. Austin, Damascen, Theophylact, Socrates Scholasticus, and S. Ber∣nard, as they are severally referr'd to and urg'd upon occasion in the following Discourse.
To which I adde, that all wise Princes till they were overborn with faction or sollicited by peevish persons, gave Toleration to differing Sects, whose opinions did not disturb the pub∣like interest: But at first, there were some he∣reticall persons that were also impatient of an

Adversary, and they were the men who at first entreated the Emperours to persecute the Ca∣tholicks; but till foure hundred yeares after Christ, no Catholick persons, or very few, did provoke the secular arme, or implore its aide against the Hereticks, save only that Arrius be∣hav'd himselfe so seditiously and tumultuarily, that the Nicene Fathers procur'd a temporary Decree for his relegation, but it was soon taken off and God left to be his Judge, who indeed did it to some purpose, when he was trusted with it and the matter wholly left to him.
But as the Ages grew worse, so men grew more cruell and unchristian, and in the Greek Church Atticus, and Nestorius of Constantinople, Theodosius of Synada, and some few others who had forgotten the mercies of their great Master, and their own duty, grew implacable and furious and impatient of contradiction. It was a bold and an arrogant speech which Ne∣storius made in his Sermon before Theodosius the younger, Da mihi, O Imperator, terram ab hae∣reticis repurgatam, & ego tibi vicissim coelum dabo: Disperde mecum haereticos, & ego tecum disperdam Persas: It was as groundlesse and unwarrantable, as it was bloody and inhu∣mane.
And we see the contrary events prove truer, then this groundlesse and unlearned promise; for Theodosius and Valentinian were prosperous

Princes, and have to all Ages a precious me∣mory, and the reputation of a great piety; but they were so farre from doing what Nestorius had suggested, that they restrained him from his violence and immanity, and Theodosius did highly commend the good Bishop Proclus for his sweetnesse of deportment towards erring persons, far above the cruelty of his Predecessor Atticus: And the experience which Christendom hath had in this last Age is Argument enough, that Toleration of differing opinions is so farre from disturbing the publick peace, or destroy∣ing the interest of Princes and Common-Wealths, that it does advantage to the publick, it secures peace, because there is not so much as the pretence of Religion left to such persons to contend for it, being already indulged to them. When France fought against the Hu∣guenots, the spilling of her own blood was argument enough of the imprudence of that way of promoting Religion; but since she hath given permission to them, the world is wit∣nesse how prosperous she hath been ever since: But the great instance is in the differing tem∣per, Government and successe which Margaret of Parma, and the Duke of Alva had: The clemency of the first had almost extinguished the flame; but when she was removed, D' Alva succeeded and managed the matter of Religion with fire and sword; he made the flame so great,

that his Religion and his Prince too hath both been almost quite turned out of the Countrey. Pelli è medio sapientiam, quoties vi res agitur, said Ennius; and therefore the best of men, and the most glorious of Princes were alwayes rea∣dy to give Toleration, but never to make execu∣tions for matters disputable: Eusebius in his se∣cond Book of the life of Constantine reports these words of the Emperour, Parem cum fide∣libus ii qui errant, pacis & quietis fruitionem gaudentes accipiant: Ipsa siquidem communica∣tionis & societatis restitutio ad rectam etiam ve∣ritatis viam perducere potest. Nemo cui quam mo∣lestus sit, quisque quod animo destinat hoc etiam faciat.
And indeed there is great reason for Princes to give Toleration to disagreeing persons, whose opinions by faire meanes cannot be al∣tered; for if the persons be confident, they will serve God according to their perswasions; and if they be publikely prohibited, they will pri∣vately convene, and then all those inconveni∣ences and mischiefes which are Arguments a∣gainst the permission of Conventicles, are Argu∣ments for the publick permissions of differing Religions, because the denying of the publick worship will certainly produce private Conven∣ticles, against which all wise Princes and Com∣mon-Wealths have upon great reasons made E∣dicts and severe Sanctions, Quic quid enim agitur

absente rege, in caput ejus plerunque redundat, say the Politicks: For the face of a man is as the face of a Lion, and scatters all base machi∣nations which breath not but in the dark: It is a proverbiall saying, quod nimia familiaritas servorum est conspiratio adversus Dominum, and they who for their security runne into grots and cellars, and retirements, think that they be∣ing upon the defensive, those Princes and those Lawes that drive them to it are their Enemies, and therefore they cannot be secure, unlesse the power of the one, and the obligation of the other be lessened and rescinded; and then the being restrained and made miserable, endeares the discontented persons mutually, and makes more hearty and dangerous Confederations. King Iames of blessed memory, in his Letters to the States of the United Provinces, dated 6 March. 1613. Thus wrote .... Magis autem è re fore si sopiantur authoritate publicâ, ita ut prohibeatis Ministros vestros ne eas disputatio∣nes in suggestum aut ad plebem ferant, ac districtè imperetis ut pacem colant se invicem Tolerando in istâ opinionum ac sententiarum discrepantiâ: ..... Eoque justiùs videmur vobis hoc ipsum suadere debere quòd neutram comperimus adeò deviam ut non possint & cum fidei Christia∣nae veritate, & cum animarum salute consi∣stere, &c. The like Councell in the divisions of Germany, at the first Reformation was thought

reasonable by the Emperour Ferdinand, and his excellent Sonne Maximilian; For they had ob∣served that violence did exasperate, was un∣blessed, unsuccessefull and unreasonable, and therefore they made Decrees of Toleration, and appointed tempers and expedients to be drawn up by discreet persons, and George Cassander was design'd to this great work, and did some∣thing towards it: And Emanuel Philibert, D. of Savoy repenting of his warre undertaken for Religion against the Pedemontans, promised them Toleration, and was as good as his word: As much is done by the Nobility of Polonia. So that the best Princes and the best Bishops gave Toleration and Impunities; but it is known that the first Persecutions of disagreeing per∣sons were by the Arrians, by the Circumcelli∣ans and Donatists, and from them, they of the Church took examples, who in small numbers did sometime perswade it, sometime practise it. And among the Greeks it became a publick and authorized practise, till the Question of Images grew hot and high; for then the Worshippers of Images having taken their example from the Empresse Irene, who put her Sonnes eyes out for making an Edict against Images, began to be as cruell as they were deceived, especially be∣ing encouraged by the Popes of Rome, who then blew the coales to some purpose.
And that I may upon this occasion give ac∣count

of this affaire in the Church of Rome, it is remarkable that till the time of Iustinian the Emperour, A. D. 525. the Catholicks and Novatians had Churches indifferently permit∣ted even in Rome it selfe, but the Bishops of Rome whose interest was much concerned in it, spoke much against it, and laboured the era∣dication of the Novatians, and at last when they got power into their hands they served them accordingly, but it is observed by So∣crates that when the first Persecution was made against them at Rome by Pope Innocent I, at the same instant the Gothes invaded Italy, and be∣came Lords of all, it being just in God to bring a Persecution upon them for true beliefe, who with an incompetent Authority and insufficient grounds doe persecute an errour lesse materi∣all, in persons agreeing with them in the pro∣fession of the same common faith. And I have heard it observ'd as a blessing upon S. Austin (who was so mercifull to erring persons as the greatest part of his life in all senses, even when he had twice chang'd his mind, yet to Tole∣rate them, and never to endure they should be given over to the secular power to be kild) that the very night the Vandals set down be∣fore his City of Hippo to besiege it, he dyed and went to God, being (as a reward of his mercifull Doctrine) taken from the miseries to come, and yet that very thing was also a par∣ticular

issue of the Divine Providence upon that City, who not long before had altered their profession into truth by force, and now were falling into their power, who afterward by a greater force turned them to be Arrians.
But in the Church of Rome, the Popes were the first Preachers of force and violence in matters of opinion, and that so zealously, that Pope Vigilius suffered himselfe to be imprisoned and handled roughly by the Emperour Iustinian, rather then he would consent to the restituti∣on and peace of certain disagreeing persons, but as yet it came not so farre as death. The first that preached that Doctrine was Dominick, the Founder of the Begging Orders of Friers, the Friers Preachers; in memory of which the Inquisition is intrusted only to the Friers of his Order; and if there be any force in dreams, or truth in Legends (as there is not much in either) this very thing might be signified by his Mothers dreame, who the night before Do∣minick was born, dream'd she was brought to Bed of a huge Dog with a fire-brand in his mouth: Sure enough, however his disciples ex∣pound the dreame, it was a better sign that he should prove a rabid, furious Incendiary, then any thing else; whatever he might be in the other parts of his life, in this Doctrine he was not much better, as appears in his deportment toward the Albigenses, against whom hee so

preached, adeo quidem ut centum haereticorum millia ab octo millibus Catholicorum fusa & in∣terfecta fuisse perhibeantur, saith one of him; and of those who were taken, 180 were burnt to death, because they would not abjure their Doctrine: This was the first example of putting erring persons to death, that I find in the Roman Church; For about 170 years before, B. Bruno Be∣rengarianes è suâ diocesi expulit, non morti aut sup∣pliciis corpo∣ralibus tradi∣dit. Berengarius fell into opinion concerning the blessed Sacrament which they cald Heresy, and recanted, and relapsed, and recanted againe, and fell again two or three times, saith Gerson writing against Romant of the Rose, and yet he died siccâ morte his own naturall death, and with hope of Heaven, and yet Hildebrand was once his judge, which shewes that at that time Rome was not come to so great heigths of blood∣shed. In England, although the Pope had as great power here as any where, yet there were no Executions for matter of opinion known till the time of Henry the Fourth, who (because he Usurped the Crown) was willing by all means to endeare the Clergy by destroying their Ene∣mies, that so he might be sure of them to all his purposes. And indeed, it may become them well enough, who are wiser in their generati∣ons then the children of light, it may possibly serve the pollicies of evill persons, but never the pure and chaste designs of Christianity, which admits no blood but Christs, and the imitating

blood of Martyrs, but knowes nothing how to serve her ends, by persecuting any of her erring children.
By this time I hope it will not be thought reasonable to say, he that teaches mercy to er∣ring persons, teaches indifferency in Religion, unlesse so many Fathers, and so many Churches, and the best of Emperours, and all the world (till they were abused by Tyranny, Popery, and Faction) did teach indifferency, for I have shewn that Christianity does not punish corporally, persons erring spiritually, but indeed Popery does; The Donatists, and Circumcellians, and Arrians, and the Itaciani, they of old did: In the middle Ages, the Patrons of Images did, and the Papists at this day doe, and have done ever since they were taught it by their S. Do∣minick.
Seventhly, And yet after all this, I have some∣thing more to exempt my selfe from the clamour of this Objection: For let all errours be as much and as zealously suppressed as may be, (the Do∣ctrine of the following Discourse contradicts not that) but let it be done by such meanes as are proper instruments of their suppression, by Preaching and Disputation (so that neither of them breed disturbance) by charity and sweet∣nesse, by holinesse of life, assiduity of exhorta∣tion, by the word of God and prayer.
For these wayes are most naturall, most prudent,

most peaceable, and effectuall. Only let not men be hasty in calling every dislik'd opinion by the name of Heresy, and when they have re∣solved, that they will call it so, let them use the erring person like a brother, not beat him like a dog, or convince him with a gibbet, or vex him out of his understanding and perswa∣sions.
And now if men will still say, I perswade to indifferency, there is no help for me, for I have given reasons against it, I must beare it as well as I can, I am not yet without remedy as they are, for patience will help me, and reason will not cure them, let them take their course, and He take mine:
Only I will take leave to consider this (and they would doe well to doe so too) that unlesse Faith be kept within its own latitude, and not cald out to patrocinate every lesse necessary opinion, and the interest of every Sect, or pee∣vish person; and if damnation be pronounced against Christians believing the Creed, and li∣ving good lives, because they are deceived, or are said to be deceived in some opinions lesse necessary, there is no way in the world to sa∣tisfie unlearned persons in the choice of their Religion, or to appease the unquietnesse of a scrupulous conscience: For suppose an honest Citizen whose imployment and parts will not enable him to judge the disputes and arguings

of great Clerks, sees factions commenced and managed with much bitternesse by persons who might on either hand be fit enough to guide him; when if he follows either, he is disquieted and pronounced damned by the other (who also if he be the most unreasonable in his opi∣nion will perhaps be more furious in his sen∣tence) what shall this man doe, where shall he rest the sole of his foot? Upon the Doctrine of the Church where he lives? Well! but that he heares declaimed against perpetually, and other Churches claime highly and pretend fairely for truth, and condemne his Church: If I tell him that he must live a good life, and believe the Creed, and not trouble himselfe with their disputes, or interesting himselfe in Sects and Factions, I speak reason: Because no law of God ties him to believe more then what is of essentiall necessity, and whatsoever he shall come to know to be reveal'd by God: Now if he be∣lieves his Creed, he believes all that is necessary to all, or of it selfe, and if he doe his morall endeavour beside, he can doe no more toward finding out all the rest, and then he is secured; but then if this will secure him, why doe men presse further and pretend every opinion as ne∣cessary, and that in so high degree that if they all said true, or any two indeed of them, in 500 Sects which are in the world (and for ought I know there may be 5000) it is 500 to one

but that every man is damn'd, for every Sect damnes all but it selfe, and that is damn'd of 499, and it is excellent fortune then if that escape; and there is the same reason in every one of them, that is, it is extreme unreasona∣blenesse in all of them to pronounce damnati∣on against such persons against whom clearely and dogmatically holy Scripture hath not; In odiosis quod minimum est sequimur, in favoribus quod est maximum, saith the Law, and therefore we should say any thing, or make any excuse that is in any degree reasonable, rather then con∣demn all the world to Hell, especially if we con∣sider these two things, that we our selves are as apt to be deceived as any are, and that they who are deceived, when they used their morall industry that they might not be deceived, if they perish for this, they perish for what they could not help.
But however, if the best security in the world be not in neglecting all Sects, and subdivisions of men, and fixing our selves on points necessa∣ry and plain, and on honest and pious endea∣vours, according to our severall capacities and opportunities for all the rest, if I say all this be not through the mercies of God, the best security to all unlearned persons, and learned too, where shall we fix, where shall we either have peace or security? If you bid me follow your Doctrine, you must tell me why, and per∣haps

when you have I am not able to judge, or if I be as able as other people are, yet when I have judged, I may be deceived too, and so may you, or any man else you bid me follow, so that I am no whit the nearer truth or peace.
And then if we look abroad, and consider how there is scarce any Church, but is highly charg'd by many Adversaries in many things, possibly we may see a reason to charge every one of them in some things; And what shall we do then? The Church of Rome hath spots enough, and all the world is inquisitive enough to find out more, and to represent these to her greatest disad∣vantage. The Greek Church denies the pro∣cession of the holy Ghost from the Son; If that be false Doctrine, she is highly too blame, if it be not, then all the Western Churches are too blame for saying the contrary: And there is no Church that is in prosperity, but alters her Doctrine every Age, either by bringing in new Doctrines, or by contradicting her old, which shewes that none are satisfied with themselves, or with their own confessions: And since all Churches believe themselves fallible, that only excepted which all other Churches say is most of all deceived, it were strange if in so many Articles which make up their severall bodies of Confessions, they had not mistaken every one of them in something or other: The Lutheran Churches maintaine Consubstantiation, the

Zuinglians are Sacramentaries, the Calvinists are fierce in the matters of absolute Predetermina∣tion, and all these reject Episcopacy, which the Primitive Church would have made no doubt to have called Heresy: The Socinians professe a portentous number of strange opinions; they deny the holy Trinity, and the satisfaction of our blessed Saviour: The Anabaptists laugh at Paedo-baptism; The Ethiopian Churches are Ne∣storian: where then shall we fix our confidence, or joyn Communion? to pitch upon any one of these is to throw the dice, if salvation be to be had only in one of them, and that every er∣rour that by chance hath made a Sect, and is distinguished by a name, be damnable.
If this consideration does not deceive me, we have no other help in the midst of these distracti∣ons, and dis-unions, but all of us to be united in that common terme, which as it does con∣stitute the Church in its being such, so it is the medium of the Communion of Saints, and that is the Creed of the Apostles, and in all other things an honest endeavour to find out Clem. Alex. stromat. 1. ait Philosophiam liberam esse praestantissi∣mam, quae scil. versatur in perspicaciter seligendis dog∣matis omnium Sectarum, Polamo Alexandrinus sic primus philosophatus est, ut ait Laërtius in Proëmio, unde cognominatus est, . what truths we can, and a charitable and mutuall permission to others that disagree from us and our opinions. I am sure this may satisfie us, for it will secure us, but I know not any thing else

that will, and no man can be reasonably per∣swaded, or satisfied in any thing else, unlesse he throwes himselfe upon chance, or absolute predestination, or his own confidence, in eve∣ry one of which it is two to one at least but he may miscarry.
Thus farre I thought I had reason on my side, and I suppose I have made it good upon its proper grounds, in the pages following. But then if the result be, that men must be permit∣ted in their opinions, and that Christians must not Persecute Christians; I have also as much reason to reprove all those oblique Arts which are not direct Persecutions of mens persons, but they are indirect proceedings, ungentle and unchristian, servants of faction and interest, provocations to zeal and animosities, and de∣structive of learning and ingenuity. And these are suppressing all the monuments of their Ad∣versaries, forcing them to recant, and burning their Books.
For it is a strange industry, and an impor∣tune diligence that was used by our fore-fathers; of all those Heresies which gave them battle and imployment, we have absolutely no Record or Monument, but what themselves who were Ad∣versaries have transmitted to us, and we know that Adversaries, especially such who observ'd all opportunities to discredit both the persons and doctrines of the Enemy, are not alwayes the

best records or witnesses of such transactions. We see it now in this very Age, in the present distemperatures, that parties are no good Re∣gisters of the actions of the adverse side: And if we cannot be confident of the truth of a sto∣ry now, now I say that it is possible for any man, and likely that the interessed adversary will di∣scover the imposture, it is farre more unlikely, that after Ages should know any other truth, but such as serves the ends of the representers: I am sure such things were never taught us by Christ and his Apostles, and if we were sure that our selves spoke truth, or that truth were able to justifie her selfe, it were better if to preserve a Doctrine wee did not destroy a Commande∣ment, and out of zeale pretending to Christi∣an Religion, loose the glories and rewards of ingenuity and Christian simplicity.
Of the same consideration is mending of Au∣thors, not to their own mind but to ours, that is, to mend them so as to spoile them; for∣bidding the publication of Books, in which there is nothing impious, or against the publick in∣terest, leaving out clauses in Translations, dis∣gracing mens persons, charging disavowed Do∣ctrins upon men, and the persons of the men with the consequents of their Doctrine, which they deny either to be true or to be consequent, false reporting of Disputations and Conferences, burning Books by the hand of the hang-man,

and all such Arts, which shew that we either di∣strust God for the maintenance of his truth, or that we distrust the cause, or distrust our selves and our abilities: I will say no more of these, but only concerning the last, I shall transcribe a passage out of Tacitus in the life of Iulius A∣gricola, who gives this account of it, Veniam non petissem nisi incursaturus tam saeva & infesta virtutibus tempora. Legimus cum Aruleno Ruslico Paetus Thrasea, Herennio Senecioni Priscus Helvidius laudatt essent, capitale fuisse, neque in ipsos modo authores, sed in libros quoque eorum saevitum delegato Triumviris ministerio ut monu∣menta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro urerentur, scil. illo igne vocem populi Rom. & libertatem Senatus & conscientiam generis hu∣mani aboleri arbitrabantur, expulsis insuper sapi∣entiae professoribus, at que omni bonâ arte in exili∣um actâ, ne quid usquam honestum occurreret. It is but an illiterate Policy to think that such in∣direct and uningenuous proceedings can amongst wise and free-men disgrace the Authors, and dis∣repute their Discourses; And I have seen that the price hath been trebled upon a forbidden or a condemn'd Book, and some men in policy have got a prohibition that their impression might be the more certainly vendible, and the Author himselfe thought considerable.
The best way is to leave tricks and devices, and to fall upon that way which the best Ages

of the Church did use: With the strength of Argument, and Allegations of Scripture, and modesty of deportment, and meeknesse, and cha∣rity to the persons of men, they converted mis∣believers, stopped the mouthes of Adversaries, asserted truth, and discountenanced errour; and those other stratagems and Arts of support and maintenance to Doctrines, were the issues of hereticall braines; the old Catholicks had no∣thing to secure themselves but the  of truth and plaine dealing.

And to my understanding, it is a plain Art and design of the Devill, to make us so in love with our own opinions, as to call them Faith and Re∣ligion, that we may be proud in our under∣standing; and besides, that by our zeale in our opinions, we grow coole in our piety and pra∣cticall duties, he also by this earnest contention.

does directly destroy good life, by engagement of Zealots to do any thing rather then be over∣come, and loose their beloved propositions: But I would faine know why is not any vitious habit as bad or worse then a false opinion? Why are we so zealous against those we call Hereticks, and yet great friends with drunkards, and fornicators, & swearers, and intemperate and idle persons? Is it because we are commanded by the Apostle to reject a Heretick after two admonitions, and not to bid such a one God speed? It is a good reason why we should be zealous against such persons, provided we mi∣stake them not. For those of whom these Apo∣stles speak, are such as deny Christ to be come in the flesh, such as deny an Article of Creed; and in such odious things, it is not safe nor chari∣table to extend the gravamen and punishment beyond the instances the Apostles make, or their exact parallels. But then also, it would be remem∣bred that the Apostles speak as fiercely against communion with fornicators, and all disorders practicall, as against communion with Hereticks, If any man that is called a brother be a Forni∣cator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one no not to eat: I am certain that a Drunkard is as contrary to God, and lives as contrary to the Lawes of Christianity, as a Heretick; and I am also sure that I know what drunkennesse is, but

I am not sure that such an opinion is Heresy, neither would other men be so sure as they think for if they did consider it aright, and observe the infinite deceptions, and causes of decepti∣ons in wise men, and in most things, and in all doubtfull Questions, and that they did not mistake confidence for certainty.
But indeed, I could not but smile at those jolly Fryers, two Franciscans offered themselves to the fire to prove Savonarola to be a Here∣tick, but a certaine Iacobine offered himselfe to Commin. l. 8. c. 19. the fire to prove that Savonarola had true Re∣velations, and was no Heretick; in the meane time Savonarola preacht, but made no such confident offer, not durst he venture at that new kind of fire Ordeal; and put case all four had past through the fire, and dyed in the flames, what would that have proved? Had he been a Here∣tick or no Heretick, the more or the lesse, for the confidence of these Zealous Ideots? If we mark it, a great many Arguments whereon ma∣ny Sects rely, are no better probation then this comes to. Confidence is the first, and the se∣cond, and the third part of a very great many of their propositions.
But now if men would a little turn the Ta∣bles, and be as zealous for a good life, and all the strictest precepts of Christianity (which is a Religion the most holy, the most reasonable, and the most consummate that ever was taught

to man) as they are for such propositions in which neither the life, nor the ornament of Christianity is concerned, we should find, that as a consequent of this piety, men would be as carefull as they could, to find out all truths, and the sense of all revelations which may concern their duty; and where men were miserable and could not, yet others that liv'd good lives too would also be so charitable, as not to adde af∣fliction to this misery; and both of them are parts of good life, to be compassionate, and to help to beare one anothers burdens, not to de∣stroy the weak, but to entertain him meekly, that's a precept of charity, and to endeavour to find out the whole will of God, that also is a part of the obedience, the choyce and the excellency of Faith, and hee lives not a good life, that does not doe both these.
But men think they have more reason to bee zealous against Heresy then against a vice in man∣ners, because Heresy is infectious and dangerous, and the principle of much evill: Indeed if by a Heresy we mean that which is against an Ar∣ticle of Creed, and breaks part of the Covenant made between God and man by the mediation of Jesus Christ, I grant it to be a very grievous crime, a calling Gods veracity into question, and a destruction also of good life, because upon the Articles of Creed, obedience is built, and it lives or dies, as the effect does by its proper

cause; for Faith is the morall cause of obedi∣ence: But then Heresy, that is, such as this, is also a vice, and the person criminall, and so the sin is to be esteem'd in its degrees of malignity, and let men be as zealous against it as they can, and imploy the whole arsenall of the spirituall armour against it, such as this, is worse then adultery or murther, in as much as the soule is more noble then the body, and a false doctrine is of greater dissemination and extent then a single act of violence or impurity. Adultery or murder is a duell, but Heresy (truly and indeed such) is an unlawfull warre, it slayes thousands: The loosing of Faith is like digging down a foundation; all the superstructures of hope, and patience, and charity fall with it: And besides this, Heresy of all crimes is the most inexcusable and of least temptation; for true faith is most commonly kept with the least trouble of any grace in the world; and Heresy of it selfe hath not on∣ly no pleasure in it, but is a very punishment; because faith as it opposes hereticall or false opinions, and distinguishes from charity, con∣sists in meare acts of believing, which because they are of true propositions, are naturall and proportionable to the understanding, and more honourable then false. But then concerning those things which men now adayes call Heresy, they cannot be so formidable as they are represen∣ted, and if we consider that drunkennesse is

certainly a damnable sin, and that there are more Drunkards then Hereticks, and that drunkennesse is parent of a thousand vices, it may better bee said of this vice then of most of those opinions which we call Heresies, it is infectious and dan∣gerous, and the principle of much evill, and therefore as fit an object for a pious zeale to contest against, as is any of those opinions which trouble mens ease or reputation, for that is the greatest of their malignity.
But if we consider that Sects are made and opinions are called Heresies upon interest, and the grounds of emolument, we shall see that a good life would cure much of this mischiefe. For first, the Church of Rome which is the great dictatrix of dogmaticall resolutions, and the de∣clarer of Heresy, and calls Heretick more then all the world besides, hath made that the rule of Heresy, which is the conservatory of interest, and the ends of men. For to recede from the Doctrine of the Church, with them makes He∣resy, that is, to disrepute their Authority and not to obey them, not to be their subjects, not to give them the Empire of our conscience, is the great  of Heresy.
So that with them, Heresy is to be esteem∣ed clearely by humane ends, not by Divine Rules; that is formall Heresy which does ma∣terially disserve them, and it would make a suspicious man a little inquisitive into their

particular Doctrins, and when hee finds that Indulgences, and Jubilies, and Purgatories, and Masses, and Offices for the dead, are very pro∣fitable; that the Doctrine of primacy, of infal∣libility, of superiority over Councels, of indi∣rect power in temporals, are great instruments of secular honour; would be apt enough to think that if the Church of Rome would learn to lay her honour at the feet of the Crucifix, and despise the world, and preferre Ierusalem before Rome, and Heaven above the Lateran, that these opinions would not have in them any native strength to support them, against the perpetuall assaults of their Adversaries, that speak so much reason and Scripture against them. I have in∣stanced in the Roman Religion, but I wish it may be considered also how farre mens Doctrines in other Sects serve mens temporall ends, so farre that it would not bee unreasonable or unne∣cessary to attempt to cure some of their distem∣peratures or misperswasions by the salutary pre∣cepts of sanctity and holy life: Sure enough, if it did not more concern their reputation and their lasting interest to be counted true belie∣vers rather then good livers, they would rather endeavour to live well, then to bee accounted of a right opinion in things beside the Creed.
For my own particular I cannot but expect, that God in his Justice should enlarge the bounds of the Turkish Empire, or some other way pu∣nish

Christians by reason of their pertinacious disputing about things unnecessary, undetermi∣nable, and unprofitable, and for their hating and persecuting their brethren which should be as dear to them as their own lives, for not con∣senting to one anothers follies, and senselesse vanities: How many volumnes have been writ about Angels, about immaculate conception, about originall sin, when that all that is solid reason or clear Revelation, in all these three Ar∣ticles, may be reasonably enough comprized in fourty lines! And in these trifles and imperti∣nencies, men are curiously busie while they neg∣lect those glorious precepts of Christianity and holy life, which are the glories of our Religion, and would enable us to a happy eternity.
My Lord, Thus farre my thoughts have car∣ried me, and then I thought I had reason to goe further, and to examine the proper grounds upon which these perswasions might rely and stand firme, in case any body should contest against them: For possibly men may be angry at me and my design; for I doe all them great displeasure, who think no end is then well ser∣ved, when their interest is disserved; and but that I have writ so untowardly and heavily, that I am not worth a confutation, possibly some or other might be writing against me. But then I must tell them I am prepared of an answer be∣fore hand: For I think I have spoken reason in my

Book, and examined it with all the severity I have, and if after all this I be deceiv'd, this confirms me in my first opinion, and becomes a new Argument to me, that I have spoken reason; for it furnishes me with a new instance, that it is necessary, there should bee a mutuall complyance and Toleration, because even then when a man thinks he hath most reason to bee confident, hee may easily bee de∣ceived.
For I am sure, I have no other design but the pro∣secution and advantage of truth, and I may truly use the words of Gregory Nazianzen, Non stude∣mus paci in detrimentum verae doctrinae, .... ut facili∣tatis & mansuetudinis famam colligamus: But I have writ this because I thought it was necessary and seasonable, and charitable, and agreeable to the great precepts and design of Christianity, consonant to the practise of the Apostles, and of the best Ages of the Church, most agreeable to Scripture and reason, to revelation and the nature of the thing; and it is such a Doctrine, that if there be variety in humane affaires, if the event of things be not settled in a durable consistence, but is change∣able, every one of us all may have need of it: I shall only therefore desire that they who will reade it may come to the reading it with as much sim∣plicity of purposes and unmixed desires of truth, as I did to the writing it, and that no man trouble himselfe with me or my discourse, that thinks before hand that his opinion cannot be reasonably altered. If he thinks me to be mistaken before he tries, let

him also think that hee may be mistaken too, and that he who judges before he heares, is mistaken though he gives a right sentence:
, Aristoph. in Pluto.
Was as good counsell: But at a venture, I shall leave this sentence of Solomon to his consideration, A wise man feareth, and departeth from evill, but a foole rageth and is confident, , is a trick of boyes and bold young fellowes, sayes Aristotle; but they who either know themselves, or things, or persons, . Peradventure yea, peradventure no, is very often the wisest determination of a Question: For there are  (as the Apostle notes) 2 Tim. 2. foolish and unlearned Questions, and it were bet∣ter to stop the current of such fopperies by silence, then by disputing them convey them to Posterity. And many things there are of more profit which yet are of no more certainty, and therefore bold∣nesse of assertion (except it be in matters of Faith and clearest Revelation) is an Argument of the va∣nity of the man, never of the truth of the propo∣sition; for to such matters the saying of Xenophanes in Varro, is pertinent and applicable, Hominis est haec opinari, Dei scire; God only knowes them, and we conjecture.
.
And although I be as desirous to know what I should, and what I should not, as any of my Brethren the Sons of Adam; yet I find that the more I search, the further I am from being satisfied, and make but

few discoveries, save of my own ignorance, and there∣fore I am desirous to follow the example of a very wise Personage, Iulius Agricola, of whom Tacitus gave this testimony, Retinuit que (quod est difficillimum) ex scientiâ modum; or that I may take my precedent from within the pale of the Church, it was the saying of S. Austin, Mallem quidem eorum quae à me quaesivisti habere scientiam quam ignorantiam, sed quia id nondum potui, magis eligo cautam igno∣rantiam confiteri, quam falsam scientiam profiteri; And these words doe very much expresse my sense. But if there be any man so confident as Luther some∣times was, who said that hee could expound all Scripture, or so vaine as Eckius who in his Chry∣sopassus ventur'd upon the highest and most mysteri∣ous Question of Predestination, ut in eâ juveniles possit calores exercere; such persons as these, or any that is furious in his opinion, will scorn me and my Discourse; but I shall not bee much mov'd at it, only I shall wish that I had as much knowledge as they think me to want, and they as much as they believe themselves to have. In the meane time, Modesty were better for us both, and in∣deed for all men: For when men indeed are know∣ing, amongst other things they are able to separate certainties from uncertainties; If they be not know∣ing, it is pity that their ignorance should bee tri∣umphant, or discompose the publike peace, or pri∣vate confidence.
And now (my Lord) that I have inscrib'd this Book to your Lordship, although it be a design of

doing honour to my selfe, that I have markt it with so honour'd and beloved a Name, might possibly need as much excuse as it does pardon, but that your Lordship knowes your own; for out of your Mines. I have digg'd the Minerall; only I have stampt it with my own image, as you may perceive by the deformities which are in it. But your great Name in letters will adde so much value to it, as to make it obtaine its pardon amongst all them that know how to value you, and all your relatives and de∣pendants by the proportion of relation. For others I shall be incurious, because the number of them that honour you is the same with them that honour Lear∣ning and Piety, and they are the best Theatre and the best judges; amongst which the world must needs take notice of my ambition, to be ascribed by my publike pretence to be what I am in all hearti∣nesse of Devotion, and for all the reason of the world,
My Honour'd Lord,
