MADAME,
KNovving, and conside∣ring, that your Ho∣nour, (as a sanctified vessell of Pietie, and as another
Elect La∣die) spendes the grea∣test part of your time, and of your Selfe, in Prayer, and in the sweet and sacred calmes of Heavenly Medita∣tions, and Contempla∣tions; And that you make, and esteeme the first to bee, (as indeed it is) your chiefest Ioy; the second, your grea∣test Delight, and both of them your divinest
Ambition, and Feli∣citie heere on Earth. I therefore (according to the dignitie of your merits, and the qualitie of my duetie) doe heere embolden my selfe, most humbly to present, and Dedicate to your
Ho∣nour, a small Tran∣slation of mine from French, Of a
Sermon lately delivered (by a worthie Servant of the Lord) in the Prote∣stant Church of Paris, vpon the firmest poynt of our
Faith, and the greatest, and most Sa∣cred Mysterie of our Salvation, The Lords most blessed Supper; And if my affection to the Authour thereof, doe not deceiue my iudg∣ment, He hath drawen this
Divine Pourtrait of that blessed Sacra∣ment, so divinely, and
so artificially and cu∣riously depaynted it at life, according to the sacred Will and Te∣stament of the Great and Heavenly Institu∣tour thereof, Our Lord and Saviour CHRIST IESVS; as I both hope with confidence, and presume with safetie, that your Honour will receiue it graciously, behold it affectionate∣ly, and loue and che∣rish it religiously; and (consequently) that all other
Readers will doe the like, by the power∣full Influence of your
Honourable Presi∣dent, and pious Ex∣ample.
And in regard, that your constant Pietie, and inflamed
Zeale towards God, (as the Queene of all your o∣ther relucent Vertues) generally makes you to bee, rather admyred, then imitated of the best and Noblest La∣dyes of Great BRI∣TAINE; Therefore (neither to flatter your Honour, or to infringe the truth) I confident∣ly beleeue, that this Pietie, and this
Zeale of yours, was the pri∣marie cause, which first mooved
God, to mooue and inspire the heart of our Potent and Pru∣dent
King, to giue you the Superintenden∣cie over his young Son, our Prince; A singu∣lar favour of God, a most speciall honour of our Soveraigne to∣wards you, which yet your
Honour deser∣ved before desired, and received before you (a∣ny way) expected, or dreamt thereof; And the which so infinitely reioyceth the hearts and and soules of the most and best of all his Sub∣iects, that they try∣umph in this his Maie∣sties happie choyce and election of you, and in your Honourable and Vertuous Administra∣tion over this our Roy∣all Faglet; As fully hoping, and therefore perfectly assuring them∣selues, that as you are now made Governesse to the first Sonne, of one of the first and greatest Kings of the world: So that, your Illustrious vertues in your selfe, your watch∣full eye over him, and vigilant care of, and for him, will (by Gods propitious Fa∣vour and Assistance) infallibly crowne his Royall Parents, with true Content, and their Kingdomes and Subiects with perfect Felicitie, to see this Princely Blossome, and Royall Plant, fu∣turely flourish, and sprout foorth to be one of the loftyest Cedars of
Christendome, and (next to our Sacred Soveraigne, King
CHARLES his Fa∣ther,) the greatest Champion of
Christ and his Gospell, and the Truest
Defen∣der of his Heavenly Spouse the Church.
And Madame, be∣cause if wee make Pie∣tie and
Religion the Soule of our life heere on Earth; That wee are therefore assured, God will then heereaf∣ter infallibly make it the life of our Soules in Heaven; was like∣wise a strong motive, and a most pleasing and acceptable Inducement to me, to make this Ser∣mon, (or
Divine Pourtrait of the bles∣sed Sacrament of the Lords Supper) to speake English; for that this spirituall and celestiall Banquet, (gi∣ven by our great Lord and Saviour IESVS CHRIST to his belo∣ved Apostles, and in them to vs, a little be∣fore his glorious depar∣ture, and ascension from Earth to Heaven) is the very true life and essence, yea, the spiritu∣all Food, and sacred Manna, whereby all faithfull and regenerate Christians, are eter∣nally incorporated into Christ, and Christ in∣to them A sweet and sacred Meditation, for every one to know and contemplate, and also most infinitely necessa∣rie for all, (by a liue∣ly Faith) verie often and frequently to apply vnto their Consciences and Soules, because it is a matchlesse Iewell, and an inestimable Trea∣sure, which includeth all earthly riches, and com∣priseth and containes all Heavenly benefits and felicities in it.
Neither am I, or so Ignorant, or so Pre∣sumptuous, to direct this Sermon of the Lords Supper to your Honour, out of the least shadow of any premedi∣tated intent or purpose, thereby to instruct, or teach you in this sacred Mysterie of your Sal∣vation; because contra∣riwise I firmely know, that your Honour is truely able to teach, and infinitely capable to in∣struct others therein: But I did it purposely to recreate your Zeale, and to foment and che∣rish your Pietie, in this your solemne Prepara∣tion to receiue that bles∣sed Sacrament, now at this approaching, great and ioyfull Feast of Ea∣ster, and next there∣vnto, as an eternall pledge and testimony of my dutie to your Ho∣nors Service. The o∣peration, ind benefite, which the reading and meditating of this small Booke, may worke in your heart and soule, I wholly leaue to the Di∣vine Providence and
Pleasure of Almightie God, whom I religious∣ly pray, may ever blesse your Honor (and yours) with all true prosperitie and happinesse in this life, and with all perfect felicity and glory in that to come.
Aprill 2. 1631.
