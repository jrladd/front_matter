Honoured Madam:
BEE pleased to pardon my boldnesse in this, and command me in what li∣beral Service you please: After many yeares specu∣culation,
and perusall of many Maps hereof, I present Your Ladiship with an Epitome, or Compendious Discourse of the Little World, MAN; not that I pre∣sume to informe you in any thing you know not; I am too sensible of my owne defects to conceive such an impossibility; my owne experi∣ences of your Ladiships Judgement here∣in, testifies the contrary; but the many Ingagements and Obligations, whereby I am bound to your Ladiship for your ma∣nifold and extraordinary favours and cur∣tesies exhibited towards me, both in sick∣nesse and in health, (having no other means to give any recompenee for them) imboldens me to present this small paper to your Ladiship, which I earnestly in∣treat you to accept into your most worthy Patronage, that I may thereby be se∣curely armed against the envious Crit∣ticks, and encouraged hereafter, if God enable me to preferre some more excel∣lent Worke to your protection; beyond
which I have no ambition, but to express my true and sincere service to your Ladi∣ship, and the right Worshipfull, your Husband, whom I beseech the Almighty to accumulate with all blessings and hap∣pinesse, present and future, taking the boldnesse to subscribe my selfe,

London 29. Octob. 1653.
