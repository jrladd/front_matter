THis Manual,
I first conse∣crate
to your
Honor. The
greatest greatnesse hath no

greater honour belonging
to it, then to bee an A∣brech,
to Persons, Books,
and causes of this nature.
Such Cedars haue their
spreadth and talenesse to
shelter such Fowles of the
Heauen vnder their sha∣dowe:
And Faith is
content in this vallie of
vnbeliefe to receiue de∣fence
and countenance:
where it rather giueth
both. As Christ in that
olde Allegorie of Chri∣stopher

seemes to be sup∣ported
by him, whome in
truth hee supporteth. And
verely such Bookes as
haue life in them giue a
longer life to their Pa∣trons,
then the stateliest
Buildings and largest
Moniments.
Principally I Dedi∣cate,
and Deuote it to your
vse; Charitie beganne at
home. I first meditated,
collected, and scribled
them for mine owne bene∣fit,

carryed them about me
with Antoninus his title
, Notes for my
selfe. That which with
all my might in seeking
I haue sought to attaine,
is the truth and effect of
that which many thinges
promise, but Faith is on∣ly
able to performe. Ful∣nesse
of ioy and constan∣cie
of content in the mid∣dest
of the chaunges,
wane, eclypses, and fuls
of all externall things,

and that one day aswell as
another throughout the
course of a mans life in
that latitude and extent
whereof this life is capa∣ble.
To cry out, I haue
found it, I haue found it,
might sauour of vanity
and arrogancy: Altoge∣ther
to deny it were an in∣iurie
to the truth of Gods
Spirit, Word, and Grace.
Such as haue found out
Sayling by the Compasse,
the Art of Printing, or

should one man discouer a
speedier passage to the In∣dies,
or meete with a spe∣ciall
Cordiall in Physicke,
or any lesse profitable se∣cret,
should he not iustly be
sensured as enuious and in∣iurious
to let such an one
die with himselfe. What a
sacriledge were it then to
engrosse such a true Eli∣xar
of Spirituall life, as
vpon some proofe, I am
sure these prescripts con∣taine.
The substance there¦fore

of them, I imparted
first ot my Flocke in Ser∣mons.
Nextly, conside∣ring
how much I stood ob∣liged
to your Lordshippe,
and what speciall vse you
might haue of them, I tran∣slated,
and copied them
out in the forme wherein
now I humbly commend,
and earnestly recommend
them to your serious per∣usall
and thorow triall. If
vpon both, good shall bee
thought the better, the

more communicated, o∣thers
shall accompt them∣selues
beholding to your
Honor, as the principall
occasion of publication.
More I would say, but
I feare to spoile the ele∣gancie
of Augustine his
Preface to Romanian,Lib. 1. con∣tra Acade∣micos.
by englishing of it: Where∣in
is the summe of what I
would say. Whither refer∣ring
your Lordship, I rest,
and continue as euer I haue
done since my reference

without intermission, pub∣likely,
and priuatly to pray
to the Lord of Lords that
you may finde all fauour
in the eyes of God and
man, and that all true
happinesse may be multi∣plyed
vpon you, and yours
in this life, and a better.
