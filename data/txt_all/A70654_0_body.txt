Right Honourable,
THis plaine piece, which (were it worthy) should bee sacred to this excellent Man, memory, comes now also devoted to your service: It should have been his picture, but becomes your possession; and let it be inter , and that by your fourfold interest.
1. In himselfe, whilest he lived, every one of you deservedly esteeming him as a Friend, a Bro∣ther, if not a Father.
2. In his losse, or rather yours of him) which because I cannot describe, vaile over with si∣lence.
3. In the worke wherein hee lived, and by



which he dyed; which was not so much his as yours; or, yours, as your Countries, your Gods: in which he laboured so much, that he died the soo∣ner, that you might have his better helpe toward the finishing of it, who (through the mercy of God) live longer.
4. In this meane Sermon, which by your com∣mand comes to publike view, and therfore craves patronage in your favourable acceptance: The Lord make it yours by a greater right; even by making the commands delivered in it to be so in∣grafted in your hearts, that you may all not onely with him be cast into the same mold, but that his Spirit may be so doubled upon you all, that you chearfully and without fainting may beare what∣ever remaining heat and burden of the day; and at last come to the same blessed evenings-recko∣ning, rest, and reward in everlasting life. So prayeth daily
