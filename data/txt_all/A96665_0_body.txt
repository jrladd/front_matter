SIR,
COuld now my Phancies Engineer give fire
To th' pleasing Traines of my select desire!
I down would those unhallow'd Altars turn
Which to your Muses high devotion burn
No thankefull Incense; She triumphs o're Sence,
Vested in gold, bought on the brains expence.
Most pretious mind! who whil'st unsalted heads
Quite uselesse are for Camp, or Arts, or Beads,

Nor ought will court but vice, and ignorance,
Whose souls lie putrifi'd in graves of Sence;
While such on Riots dream; I you admire,
Whom soul-entrancing Calentures inspire,
Melting your braine in spritely Raptures, when
Infectious is the breath of Mushrom men.
Teach, Sir, those mole-ey'd Glow-worms how to scan
Blest measures of the most accomplisht Man.
