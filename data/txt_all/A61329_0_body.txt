My Honoured Lord,
IT is not my Acquain∣tance with your Lordships Person, that makes me pre∣sume to invoke your Lordships Patronage of this small, but worthy Treatise of great Lear∣ning; for I never had the ho∣nour of ten words, with or from your Lordship, though li∣ving
formerly where your Lord∣ship did frequent, and being a Neighbour in our Youthful Years; but your Lordships own Worth and Learning, So∣briety and Prudence, with o∣ther Accomplishments taken no∣tice of in Publick in your ten∣der Years, and some Eminent Discourses of deep Mysteries, your Lordship had with a most Learned Frenchman (my wor∣thy Friend) at your return from Oxford, in the late Rebellious Times, related or intimated unto me to illustrate your Lord∣ships Perfections (being about
the same time this Author at∣tained to the said Arts) makes me not doubt but by a sympa∣thetick virtue, this English rare Phoenix of Learning in his Youth, will rather draw your Affections, than need any Intermediations for your Lord∣ships Countenance; he being probably yet living, though perchance unknown to your Lordship to be the same, by reason of his absence and Tra∣vels, which he Writes of, and his desired obscurity. I confess my Lord, I was perswaded to Dedicate it to some worthy Per∣son
of Honour; but having had sufficient experience of my few Friends in my long Troubles, I rather presumed herein upon the glory of your Honour and Vir∣tues, than any of my own Ac∣quaintance. Now, my Lord, I must crave your pardon that so obscure a person as my self, should offer so worthy a Present to your Honour, but therefore I have used the best lawful Poli∣cy, though a little unmannerly, to conceal my self, but only to re∣main,
My Lord,

Sept. 15. 1668.
