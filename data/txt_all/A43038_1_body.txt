MADAM,
SHould I have left You out, I had been guilty of much Ingra∣titude; which is a thing so foul, as that alone objected, is sufficient to make one odious to God, and man. Your La∣dyship hath often supplyed my Necessities, and never did I return from You em∣pty. As Philip the Eunuch, You have many a time made me go away rejoycing; for the Oil of Your Goodness never stayed so long, as there was a Vessel more to receive it. I know Your La∣dyship affects not Popularity: neither would have a Trumpet blown before You; being confident,
that Your Right hand was ever ignorant of the Actions of Your Left. That God, which seeth in Secret, reward You openly. This is onely to express my Thankfullness for all Your noble Favours; and to let the World know how much I am obliged to You. Again, who should pro∣tect Virtue, but the Virtuous? A glorious Frontispiece speaks somewhat within, and often begets a Desire of Inspection: So Virtue (We say) from a handsome, and comely Person, is more Acceptable; So Books owned, and protected by Noble Wights, have the better En∣tertainment from those Hands they happen to fall into. But I will detain the Reader no longer: A Small City must have Gates proportionable, lest it run out. Thus, in all Observance, I Rest,
