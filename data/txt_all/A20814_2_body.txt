MY singuler good Lady: your many vertues knowne in generall to all, and your gracious fauours to my vnworthy selfe, haue confir∣med that in mee, which before I knew you, I onely sawe by the light of other mens iudge∣ments. Honour seated in your breast, findes herselfe ador∣ned as in a rich pallace,  which makes her admirable: which like the sunne (from thence) beget∣teth most precious things of this earthly world, onely by the vertue of his rayes, not the nature of the mould. Worth is best  by the worthie, deiected mindes want that pure fire which should giue vigor to vertue. I refer to your owne great thoughts, (the vnpartiall Judges of true affecti∣on) the vnfained zeale I haue euer borne to your honorable seruice: and so rest your Ladiships humbly at commaund.
