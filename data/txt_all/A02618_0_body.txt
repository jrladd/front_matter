THinking with my selfe (Noble Lady) what I might present some way to expresse my loue in remem∣brance of those not to be requited fauours, which haue wholy obliged me to your House. It came into my mind that what is offered to gods, or great ones, ought rather to be apt, then equall: and that it was held absurd in

old time to offer an Hecatomb to the Muses, or an Iy wreath to the god of warre. I thought no offe∣ring could be more cōformable to your vertues thē this Husband, which of due doth challenge a mai∣den Maecenas: and none so fit as your selfe, who euen in these yeeres by your budding vertues, doe well bewray what fruit your vpper yeeres will pro∣duce. Accept it then Madam as an acknowledge∣ment of what is due by mee to your deseruings, which haue bound me to abide euer yours
in all dutifull obseruance,
PATRICK HANNAY.
