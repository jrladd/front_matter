WIt's, Beautie's, Vertue's perfect Quintessence
(Yet gra√ß't in soule with more Diuine perfection)
Grace, with a glance of your milde Eye's reflection,
This humble Pledge of Zeal and Reuerence:
Which (as the Stork, for gratefull recompence,
Where she hath bred, one of her Birds bestoweth)
My thankfull Muse (who you like Duty oweth)
Heer consecrates to your deere excellence.
Deer ESSEX heer (to make your Faith apparant
Vnto the Faithfull, and confirm the same)
Embrace (I pray) the Faith of ABRAHAM
Offering his Isaac (on th' Almighties warrant):
So shal th' Imputer of his Righteousness
Impute you yours; and your young Isaacs bless.
