WHen I addressed me to write this exposicion vpon Daniel / I remenbred the halcyons dayes. For thei saye that in the most sharpHalcyon is a kin∣gis fis∣sher. and coldest tyme of the yere / these halci∣ons making their nestisin the sea rockis or sandis / wil sitte their egges and hat∣cheforth their chikens. And therfore the same sea that harboureth these fowles thus sitting vpon their egges / wil be so cawme and still to her geistis for. 14. day∣es / that men may sewerly sayl without perel vpon her / not shaken nor molested with any storme or tempeste / nor yet the nestis of theis birdes so nighe the water not once shaken nor hurt with any sour∣ges. For the seas wil not for that tyme of these birdis sitting and hatching /  her geistis. And therfore is this tran∣quilite of the sea for that litle tyme / as a

rwce taking in the winter / called the hal¦cions dayes. But nowe to my purpose. As God hathe setforth in natural creatures many images & faces of his chirche / euē so vnto me reading the hole descripcion of these birdes / it hathe ben oftyn put in mynde of ye chirche yet nesteling in theis troublouse colde dayes / as it were in the sea / that is, in great troublouse empyres and kyngdoms. In whiche for a certaine litle ceason / god hath geuē bothe howse / as were a neste / and also some trāqui∣lite vnto godly studies / that the gospel might be preached / red herd / and for. 14. days rested vpō / for some chosen chykēs and faithful birdis of Cryst there to be forth hatched and fethered. Siche halci∣on dayes had the ews for that litle tyme whylis Ioan Bapt. preached / and whyls Cryst and his apostles taught & preched them penance & the kingdom of heuen to be at hande. For except / for some litle ceason there had ben peace and reste / ne∣ther might the voice of the gospell haue had bē spred a¦brode nor ye yougth taught ād brought vp therein / norany company gathered into any chirche. Which thigs to be done it is not possible / whyles by the terrible troublouse rustling toharnes and batail / and for the barberouse fyerce

furye of these soldyers / honeste societies ād congregacions be scatered / godly pre∣ching cessed / cyties & townes ouerthrone and brēt / no scoles holden / or place quiet for childern and ignorant persons to be taught. Namely when the babes be plukt from their mothers bosoms / and laddes out of their fathers handes to be slayne. These thingis whē ye se done / thē let vs lament & a knowelege the wrath of God powered forth ayenst the synnes of man∣kinde. But yet the immense mercy and goodnes of God / at some certain ceason geueth a litle breathing space to his chir∣che / making the fyerce seas cawme for a litle tyme, leste thei shuld let the halciōs to hatcheforthe their chikēs. For becau∣se therfore / that God hathe geuen vs in this region a litle quyetnes / as it were the halcions. 14. dayes reste / whiles the gospel might shyne forthe: let vs render to him thankis / and withe very godly prayers aske tranquilite & peace, that na∣mely ye youghth might be godly brought vp & taught: and also that honest & god∣ly gouerners and techers might gouerne and defende the disciplyne. For al be it great difficulties and many sharp stor∣mes haue euermore grated vpō the chir∣che to excercise hir faithe / yet do experi∣ence

shew vs / & God afore did speke it, The last olde age of the worlde to be mi∣cheThe last dayes be {per}ellous. more miserable ād sorowful then the former ages. Nether / trwly / be these pre∣dicciōs ād prophecies setforth in vaine. For God wold haue them read, that the godly hertes might prepare them selues vnto the manyfold perels ād batails / ler∣ne whiche is the very chirche of God / in whiche the voice of the gospel of the sone of god sown / thei might knowe that same to be the chirche which shal fight with the ennemies of cryst / which by his death hath for vs apeaced the wrath of the eternal father / and now rysen raig∣neth to glorifie his chirche with lyfe euer∣lasting. Thei mought knowe that these sorowful miserable calamitis shall haue an ende / euen then / when the chirche ste∣red vp ayene from dethe shal be beutifyed with glori euerlasting. Of theise thingis forasmiche as God himself very largely premonissheth vs in this boke writen of Daniel / and hath constituted euen the ordir of the tymes and ages / apointing in a maner the very limites ād bowndes of the world / sewerly the reading of this boke must nedis be profitable to goodCap. 12. men. Also the aungel himself in the ende of this boke exhorteth this laste age to

this lesson where he saith. Daniel thou shalt stonde in thy course or lotte into the ende / that is. Thou shalt do this office. Thou shalt teche and confirme the god∣ly. And cryst himself doth not onely dedu¦ce vs vnto the reading of this boke / but also commandeth vs attentyuely to con∣syder of how waighty and great thinges Daniels prophecye techeth vs / saying / whoso read it / let him take hede / whiche saying gretely moueth vs to reade this boke the gladlyer with the more diligen∣ce. Besydis this / it is ye very breif cōpen∣dious some and reherceall of the storyeA monar¦chie is o∣ne empi∣re ouer all the worlde. of the hole worlde / euen from the firste monarchye to the laste / setting befor our eyes the cleare examples of the good ād euilprinces and rulers.
Of the profite of this boke / it shalbe spoken more here aftir. But to inuyte all men vnto the reading of Daniel / I haue added breif notes. For the sayingis of the prophets be so plentuouse that thet cannot be all at once out drawne. Wher∣fore al be it these my bare and sclender cō¦mentaris be not able to satisfie the am∣plitude of ye mater / yet it profiteth to put men in minde of the cheif maters / and as it were with my fynger to point them to those places which the diligent readers

being studiouse / may by their owne medi∣tacion afterward turne to / & behold them nyerer. There be verely in Daniel many stories which require an interpretor. And in these / I think my labour to profire the yougth. Whiche my labours I permitte to the iugement of the godly and lerned / which shal iuge of this my boke both ient∣ly and louingly. And because it is comō∣ly vsed to dedicate bokis to princes and rulers / which vsage may haue many pro¦bable and graue causes, My mynde is to dedicate vnto you (most noble prīce) this my labour and litle boke / that when I hear your good will towerd the chirche of cryste and to honeste studies, to be pray¦sed / I wolde therfore declare also this your vertewe vnto the students / exhor∣ting them to loue ād reuerēce godly prin∣ces / and in their praiers commende them with their comons vnto God. Great is the infirmite of man / greter is the fury of the deuil / which brening in the hatered of god / as he thrusted out our first parēts to fall into these miserable sorouful cala∣mities / euen so studieth he perpetually to hurte Crystes chirch. And cheifly he lay∣eth awaite at the higheste head therof / & of our lyfe: nether is there any so great wi∣sedom which can wel perceyue howe gre∣at

perel there is in euery gouernance and regiment.
Wherfore all princes conioined vnto the chirche of God / ought with the prai∣ers of all faithful to be holpen / that God whiche geueth helthe vnto kings wold once rule their counsess and bowe their myndes & their enforcements vnto their owne and to the publik sauing helthe. Of this thig the readers shuld be monisshed in this kinde of dedicacions. For the re∣ding of noble and clear examples / shuld exhort the same princes thēselues vnto modesty moderaciō / & to pyte / not to slaye ohō so euer the aduersaries of god wold haue killed / but to fere God. Which ex∣amples / for this ende hath God set befor their eyes / to call them and their posteri∣te to the study and scole of vertew. I ther fore besech God hertely the father of Ie su Cryste our delyuerer to preserue you / & so to gouern you / that your gouernance be happye & prosperouse to you / to your countrye / & to the chirche of cryste / euen the very trewe comonal∣tie of all. So be it. In the Calends of Ianuary. 1545. transla∣ted.
