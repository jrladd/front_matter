Right Honourable,
IT was not upon long Considera∣tions, but easie resolutions, that I pitched upon your Lordship, & determined to presume upon your patronage of this small review of the acti∣ons of his SACRED MJESTY,) whose hard fortunes may now demand a Subjects protection since I could no where else find a person who bears so great a name of true Honour and Generosity, nor one whose assured loyalty will make him lesse ashamed or afraid to owne his Prince.
And indeed (my Lord) when I looked
upon these Nations, once I may say almost peopled with Nobles, and now in a great measure deprived both of her Nobility and Gentry, 'twas easie for me to find out the Prime of those remaining, which a small search told me was your Lordship; who, though you have been no whit behind the foremost in Loyalty, yet God hath been pleased to make others drinke deeper in the Cup of affliction then your selfe.
But all those miseries which either your Lordship or other loyal persons have suf∣fered, cannot come in competition with those undergon by his SACRED MA∣JESTY, who hath drunk up the very dregs of the Cup, and suffered more then can be well spoken; yet all with so incom∣parable a patience as worthily deserves our wonder.
My Lord, you are amongst the Prime of the Nobility, which God hath yet been pleased to spare this miserable Nation; & as you are so, I could not think any person fitter for the patronage of this small piece; since both your loyalty may make you wil∣ling,
and your power able to protect it.
If I have soar'd too high either in the subject or dedication, I shall humbly crave your Lordships pardon▪ and answer to the first? That I was willing to vindicate my Sovereign (as far as in me lay) from those many reproaches and calumnies cast upon him by his back-biting enemies by giving the best account (that either my own knowledge or the surest intelligence I could get might enable, me to) of all his actions that he might appear the contrary of what he is represented, & dirt be cast in the faces of his Accusers. To the second, I wholly cast my selfe on your Lordship, either to pardon or condemn.
But if my Love to his Majestie may in the judgements of some have strained my pen too much in his favour, I desire it may be imputed not to my intent, but passion; for the unworthy sufferings of so worthy a Prince would irritate any loyall Subject.
My Lord, whilst yotr Lordship shall be gratiously pleased to patronize this small worke, that GOD would be plea∣sed
to restore his Majesty to be Patron of his Kingdoms and people, and blesse your Lordship with all imaginary blessings; shall be the daily prayers of,
