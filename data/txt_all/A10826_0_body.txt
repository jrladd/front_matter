MADAME:
AS Piety and Righteousnes are two no∣ble vertues of the Re∣generat part of the soul,

so Humility and Loue are the neuer-perishing fruit of such euer-blessed trees.
The eminency of these in your Honor, hath en∣couraged mee (but alas what am I?) to entreat your Honor to shelter this vnpolished Trea∣tise, vnder the shaddow of your Honors Patro∣cinie. In it your Honor may finde selected me∣dicines out of Scrip∣ture, and the godly and learned of our time,Mr. Hoo∣ker. for the restoring of the Christian his weak con∣science:Mr. Dee∣ring. not embelli∣shed

with deceitfull ca∣uillations of humane wisedome, but arayed with the Euidency, Na∣kednesse and Simplicity of truth. In it your Ho∣nor may finde (I say) the wauering faith con∣firmed, not with cordi∣alls of foolish empiri∣acks, but with the al-cu∣ring Balme of Gilead, frō Gods Sion; which dig∣nifieth all mens actions here, & crowneth them in Christ hereafter.
Thus (Madame) wishing eternall con∣tinuance of your Ho∣nors good and happy

beginnings, euer secon∣ded with the fauour of God in Christ, I com∣mit your Honor to him, who is able to doe a∣boue all we aske or thinke.
