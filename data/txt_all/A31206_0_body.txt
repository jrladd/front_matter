Most Dread Soveraign,
THose Great Acquests
of Glory which ordi∣narily
did attend the For∣tune
of Alexander, are
now, upon a more great and
solid Account, become Your
Majesties just Trihute.

The Insatiable desire of
that Illustrious Macedo∣nian,
to establish his Great
Name in the Memory of
the World, was the Chief
Cause, by which he made
his way through the Cre∣dulity
of that Age, to the
Seat of Jupiter Hamon.
To be Esteemed less than
a Deity, fell short of the
Ambition of that Aspiring
Monarch: But Your Ma∣jesties
Great Soul, of a
more Pious Stamp, keeps
Touch with the Will of

Heaven, and instead of
false and flashy Adoration,
Your Majesties utmost
Aime is that Distinguish∣ing
Glory of being placed
(like good King David)
in the Throne of Justice.
Yet, Royal Sir, I hope
you will allow the many
and indispensable Favours
which we daily receive
from Your Majesties Wise
Conduct, not only do oblige
us to Pay our utmost Ac∣knowledgments,
but also
to follow You, as another
Joshua of the People.

The many and uncommon
benefits which generally
accrew from a Magnani∣mous
Prince, to the Wel∣fare
of his Subjects, con∣firm
the Affections of the
Dutiful, and prevail
more than all the Argu∣ments
which Reason or
Religion can produce
to the Conservation of
Loyalty.
To gratifie the Ambiti∣on
of some, Fortune, for a
Time, has afforded fresh
Laurels, when the chief

design of such Aspirers, is
only to Embroil the World,
and Conquer more upon
the Account of their own
Vain-Glory, than tbe Pub∣lick
Justice.
But Your Majesties just
Cause, moves in a higher
Sphere, and engages Your
Royal Person in a War,
as well to the Preservation
of our Religion, as our
Liberties, as if the Two
Great Tables of the Law
were Engraved on Your
Majesties Sword.

Go forward then, most
Sacred Sir, in Your Royal
Ʋndertakings, and make
Your Name as Eternal, as
Illustrious, that by each
Auspicious Act, the World
may see, that while Good
Princes Live, the Great
Creator of Heaven is their
Protector uopn Earth; and
when Dead, the World
the Preserver of their
Memories.
I am therefore bold,
Most Sacred Majesty, to
lay the Ensuing Tract at

Your Royal Feet, and De∣dicate
this Translation of
True Valour, to Your
Gracious Acceptance, in
which may plainly be per∣ceived,
in Two particular
Chapters of the same, tho'
Writ several Years since,
The true Prophetick Cha∣racters
of the late King
James, and Your Present
Majesty; The Subject
Matter of which agreeing
so exactly with the whole
Series of Your Majesties
Life, and which Your Ma∣jesty

is so well Experienced
in, gives me hopes of Your
Majesties Royal Patro∣nage,
and encourages this
Presumption, of Subscrib∣ing
my Self,
