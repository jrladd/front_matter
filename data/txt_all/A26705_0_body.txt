Reverend Sir,
THE motion made in yours concerning Prayer, hath much affected me, and hath occasioned some workings of my thoughts, which though (in a conscience of mine own weakness I more than once laid aside, yet they still return'd upon me; and I do now here offer the result of them to your Consideration.
We all know and teach, that they are only returning and refor∣ming Prayers that will prevail with God; and 'tis to be doubted, that in this dead and decayed age there are too many professors who will joyn in the design of Prayer, whom this must serve instead of
Reformation, 'tis to such especially that the Directions in the inclosed Papers are intended. I send them to you, desiring you to read them, and then to do what you please with them; beseeching you, and trusting upon your friendly faithfulness here∣in, thar you will take your full free∣dom, either to keep them in silence to your self, or else to communicate and make them publick. I should thankfully accent of any expung∣ings, alterations or additions that you shall think needful. The Lord pardon the failings, and accent the sincere aims of my soul herein. To his Grace I commend you, and in him I rest,
Dear Sir,
