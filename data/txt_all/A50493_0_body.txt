SIR,
DIvine Providence having
suffered these Kingdoms
to destroy one another for
many Ages, in divided Monar∣chies;
reserv'd their happy Union
for the Merciful Royal Family, of
which Your Majesty is now the
Head: and mingl'd lawfully in
their Veins,V. The last four pages of the Book. all those many and
different Bloods-Royal, which
pretended to any Soveraignty in
these your Dominions: designing
thereby at once to reward the
Vertue of Your Majesty's Prede∣cessors,
and to endear that Union
to us, in preventing future De∣bates.
In King Iames, Your Royal
Grand-Father, these Nations got

a Monarch, who was acknow∣ledg'd
to be the Solomon of His
Age: who excell'd all His Con∣temporary
Princes inHis own word. King-Craft;
all his Ministers in Pru∣dence;
and all His Doctors in
Learning. None of his Subjects
understood the Law better, or
observ'd it more: and who
knew as well all that was done
at Council-Tables abroad, as
they who sat at them. To Him
succeeded Your Majesty's Royal Fa∣ther,
whose Life was the best
Law a King could make: who
knew no use of Power, save to
do good by it: who was less
careful of His own Blood, than
of that of his Subjects: And I
may justly say, that Heaven only
was govern'd by a better King.
After we had shown our selves
unworthy of such Monarchs, the
Divine Goodness, to try us once

more, gave us Your Gracious Bro∣ther,
whose Clemency (after so
many and so great Injuries) was
as great a Miracle as His Restora∣tion:
who knew every thing
save to be severe; and could
bear every thing, save to see His
People in trouble: who after
the abuse of His Goodness, had
made his Enemies so insolent,
that His Servants concluded all
was lost; did, by His extraordi∣nary
parts, with a gentle easiness,
peculiar to Himself, dissipate those
execrable Combinations, to our
great satisfaction and amazement.
But, Sir, the Conscience of His
Enemies, will far exceed in His
Praises, the Eloquence of His
Servants; and so my trembling
Hand leaves this Melancholy Sub∣ject.

His Throne is now fill'd with
Your Sacred Majesty, whose Abi∣lities
Your Royal Brother esteem∣ed
so much, that He shar'd with
You the Exercise of the Go∣vernment,
before His Death gave
you the Possession of the Crown.
In You, Sir, Your People have
a General to their Armies, an Ad∣miral
to their Fleet, a Treasurer
to their Mony: whose Courage
can lead them as far as theirs can
follow; and raise the Glory of
these Kingdoms as high as they
can wish: So that if they be not
happy, they will have this Addi∣tion
to their Misfortunes, that
the World will see, that they
themselves are only to be blam'd
for it.
Our Country, Sir, does not
boast of a rich Soil, or a hot Sun:
but it may, that it has given these

happy Islands those Gracious and
Glorious Kings. In return where∣of,
we might have expected
kinder Rewards, than that any
of their Natives should debate
its Antiquity, and the Veracity
of those Histories wherein the
great Actions of Your Royal Pre∣decessors
were recorded. And
since the Honour of the Ancient
and Royal Race of our Sove∣raigns
is the chief thing wherein
we Glory; it is hard to deny us a
Favour, so just on our part, and
so easy on theirs. However, Sir,
since I presume, that those of
Your other Subjects, who con∣trovert
this, do so, rather from
want of information, than from
unkindness; I, who am resolv'd
to make the defence of Your
meanest Priviledges my greatest
Honour, have thought it incum∣bent
to me, as Your Advocate, to

undertake the defence of that An∣tiquity,
which makes Your Maje∣sty
the most Ancient Monarch up∣on
Earth. Which Argument, I
hope, I have manag'd with that
Candour, which becomes an ho∣nest
Man, and that Zeal which
is the Duty of,
SIR,
