Right Worshipful,
It is not out of any satietie that I change
from the Old Testament to the New;
these two, as they are the Breasts of
the Church, so they yield Milk equally
wholesome, equally pleasant unto able
Nurselings. Herein I thought good to
have respect unto my Reader, in whose strength there may be
difference. That other Breast perhaps doth not let down
this nourishing liquor so freely, so easily. Even so small
a variety refresheth a weak Infant. Neither will there
perhaps want some palates which will finde a more quick

and pleasing relish in this fresher substance. These I thought
good to please with a Taste, ere they come to sate themselves
with a full Meal of this Divine nourishment; in emulaâˆ£tion
of the good Scribe, that brings forth both old and
new. If it please God to inable my life and opportunities,
I hope at last to present this Church with the last service
of the Historie of either Page: wherein my Joy and my
Crown shall be the Edification of many. In the mean
time, I dedicate this part unto your Name, whom I have
so much cause to observe and honour. The Blessing of that
God whose Church you have ever made your chief Client
be still upon your head, and that honourable Society which
rejoyces in so worthy a Leader. To it and your self I shall
be ever (as I have cause)
