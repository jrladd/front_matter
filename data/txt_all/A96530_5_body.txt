SIR,
YOÆ² cannot but know by whom this Text was given to me: But I cannot know to whom this Sermon may be given so rightly as to the Giver of the Text. Give me leave then to give that to you a second time, and by a second way, which hath been yours from the first. Why should it not be yours in your Hands, as well as yours in your Head, and yours in your Heart? The Text was very well taken from his hands that gave it: And I will hope that those hands which gave the Text, will take the Sermon so. Indeed I must needs say, the Text was very worthy to be accepted; But so I dare not say of the Sermon. But if you please to take it as it is, it is as it was. It was yours from the Pulpit at the first; And yours for ever it must be from the Presse, by all the right that may be.

I have minded you already of your Interest in the Argument: But I suppose I need not minde you of your Interest in the Author, Who is
Sir,
