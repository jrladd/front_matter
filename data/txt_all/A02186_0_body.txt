BEing earnestly re∣quested, and often intreated (Right Worshipfull) by many of my good friends, to put in print this small Treatise of the Generall day of

Doome, which I lately preached, and in publike place deliuered: I haue (being ouercome with their perswasions) condescended to their earnest demaund, although very vnapt, and exceedingly vn∣worthy, for the penning of so wor∣thy a matter.
Wherfore I haue made choyse (crauing pardon for my presump∣tion herein) of your wel-disposed Worships at this time (being the Alpha of my tender and slen∣der indeuours) to sound in your sacred eares this last and generall Trumpe, and to Dedicate to your Worships the same, both in re∣gard of the demonstration of my true, vnfeined, and lasting thank∣fulnesse to your benigne Wor∣ships (for, sayth Seneca: Beneficium hominem gratum semper delectat, in∣gratum semel: id est; A thankefull

man will alwayes remember a be∣nefite; but an vnthankefull person will soone forget it) for your ex∣traordinary kindnesse bestowed vpon mee, Absque vllo commerito, without any desert in the World: as also in regard of the great affe∣ction, good deuotion, and thrice welcome entertainment you beare to Diuine and Spirituall Tractates, which appertaine to the euerla∣sting blisse of the Soule, accoun∣ting them blessed, which bring glad tidings of saluation. I desire therefore (id{que} more humillimo, in most submissiue manner) this one thing at your Worships hands, that you would (pardoning my boldnesse) vouchsafe aequi boni{que} consulere, to take in good worth this simple and slender gift. Which thing if your Worships shal vouch safe to doe, it shall not onely bee

an incouragement to my future proceedings, but also it shall bee Vinculum indissolubile, an inuinci∣ble bond to tye mee in all duety, and in all loue to your Worships: Dum memor ipse mei, dum spiritus hos regit artus; so long as life shall last.
Thus humbly taking my leaue of your good Worships, (no∣thing doubting of the good∣nesse of your natures in the accep∣tance of these my first presented fruits) I commit you with yours to the safe protection of the Al∣mighty, alwayes begging before the Throne of his most Glorious Maiesty, that he would in this life, infuse his Holy Spirit, with all his Graces, into your hearts a∣boundantly, and in the World to come, crowne you with the Crowne of immortall Glory:

And that for CHRIST IESVS his sake, our LORD and onely SAVIOVR Amen.
From Hempsted in Essex. Ian. 10. 1620.
