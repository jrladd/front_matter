S Seeke vvith care, serue vvith faith, think PLATOES saying on earth
T To serue thy God, thy Prince, thy soyle, did nature poynt thy birth.
O Offende no man, deserue due prayse, the poore doe not denie:
F Forget not PHILIPS Page that sayd, O PHILIP thou must die.
O Obay the lavves, hurt no man, hate not the siely Groome:
R Right so in Englande shalt thou haue, as POMPE had in Rome.

N Nothing must abounde to much CLEOBVLVS biddes agayne.
V Vertue buildes hir blasing bovver, in sacred breast to breede:
