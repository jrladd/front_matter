CHristian Reader,
I be∣seech thee, as thou ten∣derest thy salvation, that thou wouldest throughly exa∣mine the following Disputa∣tion, in the fear of God, consi∣dering how much his glory is concerned therein; and at any hand forbear to condemn my opinion as erroneous, till thou art able to bring pertinent and solid Answers to all my Argu∣ments; for thou must know, that though I have contested with sundry learned men, yet hath none hitherto produced a satisfactory Answer to so much as one Argument.
Farewel.
