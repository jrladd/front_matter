Right Honourable,
THE Triumphs and Sollemnities of this Day, are dedicated and deuoted to this your happy Inauguration, which as Time warranteth, so Custome confirmeth: And herein hath this City a Priority aboue any Metropolis in Europe: For Rome it selfe when the Monar∣chy of the world was vnder her sole Iurisdiction, neuer receiued her Praetor, Consul, or Dictator with the like Pompe and Sol∣lemnity: yet is it deriued vnto you from Antiquity, and I wish it may continue to all Posterity. And Sir, for your owne part I am not altogether vnacquainted with your Modesty, which would willingly haue euaded this honourable trouble, but now you finde that the Condition of Honour is such, that it inquireth after him who regardeth it not, courteth him that affecteth it not, and followeth him fastest who most flyeth it, as knowing that it is not the Place which maketh the Person, but the Person which maketh the Place truely Honourable, which now hath inuited you to your merit, howsoeuer against

your minds, according to that of the  her Lyui. Decad. Li. 4  in∣terdum non cupientibus sut. Adising you withall  this your high Office and Calling, to obserue the necessary adiuncts thereto belonging, namely, Affbility with Authority and with your Sword and Power, Commiseration and itty: Neither can I wish you a better President to imitate then your Predecessor, of whom I may say,
Semper honos nomenque suum laudesque manebunt.
Not questioning but that wee may speake the like of your selfe, and the two worthy Gentlemen the Sheriffes, your Assistants, when Time, shall summon you to resigne your places to these which shall succeed you: And thus I humbly take my leaue of your Lordship, with this Sentence borrowed fr Seneca, Bo∣num est laudari, sed praestantius est esse laud .
