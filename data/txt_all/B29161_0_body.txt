May it please your Lordship,
TO take into your Patronage the REMAINS of a great and lear∣ned Man, which since 'twere an Injury, and Uncharitableness to the World, to let them perish, may live and preserve his Memory to Posterity, by the favourable countenance of your Lord∣ship's Name. And indeed to whom should I rather address the pious and usefull La∣bours of a truly Primitive and Apostoli∣cal Bishop than to your Lordship, who
deservedly bear the same Character your self? My Lord, your Lordship has an Interest and Claim in the Studies of your Clergy, and being your self so great a pat∣tern of what is truly Generous and Noble, it begets a kind of Confidence in me, that your Lordship will not despise my poor and weak Endeavours in promoting any usefull Truths, who am in all Sincerity,
My Lord,
