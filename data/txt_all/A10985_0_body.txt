MY LORD,
THis little Booke being written by so excellent a person as the Duke of Rohan, and treating of so weighty a Subject as the Interest of the Princes and States of Christendome, being re∣ceived also with good esteeme by some judicious men, I thought it not amisse to communicate the same, imploying the advantage of so many spare minutes (during my abode in France) as to make it speake English. Then being invited to ex∣pose it to the light, to the publike view, the pub∣like voyce taught it to implore your Lordships protection, whether be considered the quality of the Author, the gravity of the Matter, or

Knowledge in the Originall wherein it was pen∣ned. For as the Author was noble, and eminent in his place; in like manner is your Honour, shining in your orb as a starre of the first Mag∣nitude, lending a most benigne and gracious in∣fluence to the just causes of the oppressed, distressed, fatherlesse, and widow. The Matter is of politick maximes, and divers remarkable occurrences in sundry Republikes: and to whom now can this be more aptly addressed then to a principall Mi∣nister of State, in whom Prudence, Science, and Integrity (in a sweet harmony) doe all con∣curre to make a perfect conduct of affaires, for the glory of God, the honour of the King, and the good of this Church and Common-wealth? Lastly, the Originall from whence it was derived, being French: your admired knowledge, and unparal∣lell'd expressions in the same language, may speake you as well a patterne in the originall, as a Patron in this translation. For my owne part (if it may be permitted to say any thing of my selfe) I speak con∣fidently (My Lord) with your permission, that al∣beit I had not so much vanity as to perswade my selfe that any thing could proceed from me, worthy your reception, or advantagious to your Honour,

(since that my act herein shewed more of duty then merit, and its insufficiencie demanded rather par∣don then remuneration;) yet had I some kinde of as∣surance, that a favourable acceptation would en∣tertaine what I most humbly present, seeing the most heroick minde disdaines not the meanest ser∣vices, but like the Sunne (that nobler Planet) spreads his indifferent rayes upon all, as well on ab∣ject, as glorious objects. These and such like con∣siderations made me adventure (but with all re∣verence and humility) to prefix here your most Honorable Name, that thereby this Book might live; and withall incessantly beseeching him whose name is I AM, to preserve and continue Yours in perpetuall being, in all honour and prosperity, and to write your name in a larger volume, the Book of life. For which end the Lord be still your Keeper, and Seale you with that great Seale, the holy Spirit of promise, to the day of redemption. So prayeth
My Lord,
