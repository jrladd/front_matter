THE Good Reception the World afforded to the First Impression of the greater part of the following Sheets, has en∣gaged me to send 'em again abroad, ina more exact dress, and with considerable Additi∣ons. You will find in these Memoires a number of things which have escap'd the vi∣gilance of all former Travellers. First you have a Description of all the Islands of Cape-Verd; From whence the Author Sayling to Madagascar, where he stays long enough to know the Quality of the Country, and the Manners of the Inhabi∣tants, whereof he gives so exact a Descrip∣tion, that nothing seems to be omitted.
Then he pursues his Voyage to the Isle of Java Major, of which, and especially of the Kingdom of BANTAM, he gives so particular an account, that it equally serves to the Readers instruction and entertain∣ment; is both profitable and agreeable.

What he says afterwards of SIAM, is no less useful and pleasant. He relates circumstances of that Country as were not yet known; and the Description he makes of it is so perfect and delightful, that it is easie to perceive he himself took a singular plea∣sure therein. I say nothing of Formosa, whereof he only speaks by the by, tho what he says thereof, teaches us that all Men are not made after the same manner. He ends his Voyage with a Description of Nangue∣siaque, and of the Manners of the Japane∣zes, whereof he gives a pretty, tho short ac∣count, knowing there have been great Volumes upon that Subject. And this Edition be∣ing perfect and correct, I do not question but the Reader will give it even a more favou∣rable entertainment than the former; espe∣cially being all along interwoven with such surprizing Cercumstances and Stories, as will undoubtedly render the perusal of it ve∣ry delightful; particularly at this Jun∣cture, when an Ambassador from those Countries, does make People the more de∣sirous of an account of this nature.
