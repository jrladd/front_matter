May it please your most excellent
Maiestie,
THE scope and intent
of Christian Religion
seemes onely this, to
raise vp man from the
deapth of miserie and
sinne, to the state of
happinesse and saluation, from whence
he is fallen: in effecting whereof, the one∣ly
powerfull and all-sufficient meanes is
Christ crucified, God in our nature, our
nature with God, God & man reconciled

in the person of Christ, who was both
God and man; here is the great propitia∣torie
sacrifice. For particular applicati∣on
whereof, there is requisite in euery
one, Faith, which (supposing our natu∣rall
blindnesse and ignorance) takes our
selues from our selues, placeth vs in
God, seeing him, and beholding him, we
see no more then he himselfe hath reuea∣led;
Hope, (supposing our naturall di∣strust
and fearefulnes) notwithstanding
the number and weight of our sinnes, yet
casts a sure and strong anchor vp into
Heauen, and there laies holde on Gods
promises; Charitie, (supposing mans na∣turall
disobedience and rebellion) de∣sires
a conformitie of the head to the
members, and of the members betweene
themselues. Thus Faith looks to the wis∣dome
and truth of Gods nature, stands
astonied at the mysteries, and takes all
the articles of our Creede for her lessons:
Hope fastens on the mercy and good∣nesse
of God, by the feruencie of Praier,

and the strong apprehension of the spi∣rit,
making the Lords Praier her pat∣terne
and president: Charitie considers
the rule of Gods iustice, desires to square
all our actions according to leuell, and
lookes to the tables of the Lawe, as her
obiects. Here is the fabricke of the
Church, Faith laies the foundation,
Hope buildes vp the walles, Charitie
giues it a couering, for Charitie doth couer
a multitude of sinnes: but how shall mans
naturall weakenesse attaine to these
Theologicall vertues? As in all great
buildings, so likewise here there are in∣struments
and tooles appoynted to sup∣plie
our defects; and these are chiefely
and principally Sacraments, and what∣soeuer
else God hath commanded for
his reasonable seruice. This is in effect the
summe of Christian Religion, this is the
summe of our ordinarie Catechisme.
Thus before wee can raise man, he must
first acknowledge his fall: he that shall
intend to make any buildings in Gods

Church, must lay the foundation in
mans fall: for this is the porch or first
entrance which leades vs to Christian
Faith; and therefore speaking hereof, I
thought fit to speake to the capacitie of
the naturall man: herein I shall not need
to straine his vnderstanding, to impose a
yoake of faith, when as his owne reason
shall reueale it in the substance, though
not in the circumstance.
This fall of man appeares in the mi∣series
of man, which being truely disco∣uered,
may teach vs what wee are in our
selues. The greatnesse of our woe shewes
the large extent of our sinne: this world
which we inhabit, is but a vale of mise∣rie,
the happinesse of this world, is onely
a painted miserie; in this miserie we may
acknowledge the great mercy of God,
who first created vs in happinesse, and
notwithstanding our sinnes hath still or∣dained
vs to happinesse; and in these mi∣series,
he hath giuen vs some ease, as much
as is befitting our present state and con∣dition;

in sustaining these miseries, hee
hath inabled vs with patience, and the
holy comfort of his spirit; and euen our
greatest miseries hee hath taken vpon
himselfe, the more to teach him compas∣sion,
and with his miseries to satisfie for
ours. Thus not onely the blessings and
good gifts of God, but likewise our mi∣series
set forth his goodnes. And thus as
I haue endeuoured to shew the mercy
and prouidence of God in generall to
whole mankinde, especiallie for our
soules health and saluation; so here ma∣king
bolde to write vnto your Maiestie,
I could doe no lesse, then take some no∣tice
of the temporall blessings, where∣with
God hath blessed vs aboue other
people. This blessing especially consists
in gouernment, whereby we receiue the
fruites of peace, of plentie, of happines,
and liue securely vnder the protection
of our Princes; this blessing seemes to
bee proper to this nation, proper to this
present age wherein wee liue: for I will

not speake how in former times, this our
Land was distracted with small principa∣lities
and gouernements; when it should
seeme the greatest part lay waste in bor∣ders
and confines, when the strength was
diuided within it selfe; I will onely
beginne with the last age of our fore∣fathers.
When as the dissention had long con∣tinued
between the two houses of Yorke
and Lancaster, it pleased God so to per∣mit,
that the house of Yorke staining it
selfe with his owne blood, when a cruell
and mercilesse tyrant did murther most
innocent and harmelesse Children, and
thereby vsurped the Crowne; this tyran∣nie
being likewise extended to others,
and a most reuerend Bishop being com∣mitted
to safe custodie; (God remembring
Ioseph in all his troubles), his prison was his
castle of defence, and his close keeping
did serue as a counsell-Chamber for se∣crecie,
where this reuerend Prelate, to∣gether
with the greatest lay subiect, as

it were a representatiue Parliament con∣sisting
of Lords Spirituall and Tempo∣rall,
Church and state together conspi∣ring,
did there contriue the happy means
of their deliuerie, to bring in Henry of
Richmond to suppresse this tyrant. And God
blessed the successe accordingly, that so
still the same goodnesse of God might
appeare vnto vs, which was once manife∣sted
to the Israelites vnder the tyrannie
of Pharaoh, where the poore innocent
children were likewise put to death, the
crie of my afflicted people is come vp vnto
my eares, Exod. 3. 7.
This Henry of Richmond being de∣scended
from the house of Lancaster,
did therein seeme to promise vnto the
world all happie successe; for men were
well perswaded of that familie, being all
of them most eminent for great vertues
and qualities (as may appeare) Hen. 4. for
his behauiour and courtesie: the Fifth, for
his valour and magnanimitie: the Sixth,
for his iustice and pietie. Now in the per∣son

of this Henry, it is strange to obserue
the prouidence of God; whereas the
Cambro-Britaines (whom we improper∣lie
call Welsh) were the most ancient
inhabitants of this Iland, being excluded
and exiled into the most remote and bar∣ren
parts, and there not suffered quietlie
to rest, but brought vnder yoake and
subiection, and hauing once beene van∣quisht,
yet could neuer bee admitted to
the common libertie of subiects; and
therfore flesh and blood could not with∣hold
it selfe, or patiently endure such a
bondage, but vpon all occasions they
did continuallie reuolte: beholde, this
good King Henry descended from them,
bearing their name, and therefore by
them making his first entrance into this
happy Kingdome, (in token and memo∣rie
whereof he gaue his eldest Sonne the
name of Arthur) it hath pleased God,
that since that time, no people hath con∣tinued
more loyall and obedient to their
Princes then they. So that now, that

which before was spoken more impro∣perly,
and is at this time still carried in
the Armes of our yong Princes ()
it is truely verified accor∣ding
to the letter; God laughing at the
counsells of men, can erect the pillar
of his prouidence in the vaine thoughts
and cogitations of man.
Thus in his person, we may consider
the quieting and pacifying of that na∣tion;
now being possessed of the Crowne,
whereas (in humane policie) his sworde
might haue kept it, as it was wonne by
the sworde, yet it should seeme, that hee
respected rather the good of this king∣dome,
and the good of posteritie. And
therefore by the happinesse of his mar∣riage,
hee  severall fami∣lies,
by whose diuision so many bloodie
batailes had beene fought; our cruel∣tie
was practised vpon our selues▪ our
Townes became vnpeopled, our land
was left desolate, and fourescore Nobles
and Princes of the blood Royall were

slaine and murthered, so that mens
mindes were daily distracted, and vpon
euery dislike of the present gouerne∣ment,
men had free refuge to that part,
which they conceiued might bee most
for their aduantage: miserable was the
condition both for Prince and Subiect,
but now are the roses vnited, the houses
conioyned, by a most inseparable bond;
for chaines and linkes of iron are not of
such strength and force, as are the bonds
of mariage.
After the happinesse of his mariage,
followes the happinesse of his issue and
succession: for his issue male ending in
females, and gouerning this Scepter
with great glorie and magnificence, for
the space of a fullage, it pleased God so
to dispose in his prouidence, that this
wise King being to place his two daugh∣ters
in mariage, the one into Scotland,
the other into France; and question be∣ing
made by some of his Counsell where
the eldest should bee bestowed? his an∣swere

was, that hee had rather bring
Scotland into England, then carrie Eng∣land
into France: as it were foreseeing
in his wisdome (like a Propheticall spi∣rit)
the meanes and occasions whereby
these Kingdomes might happilie be vni∣ted;
and God blessed the successe accor∣dingly.
For whereas since that time, by
all likelihoode and probabilitie, this
Kingdome should haue beene vnited,
sometimes to Spaine, sometimes to
France, and once, by an intended mari∣age
to Scotland, though otherwise so
backt with violence and force, as being
more vnnaturall, was therefore lesse ac∣ceptable
to God: but God, who had ap∣pointed
the vniting of these kingdomes,
had likewise appointed the meanes; lest
the greater should seeme to contene
the lesse, therefore the lesser kingdome
should containe in it selfe the right of in∣heritance
to the greater. And thus this
good King being inferior to none, ei∣ther
for valour, (for so hee attained his

Crowne▪ or for wisdome, being trained
vp in the schoole of Lewis the eleuenth,
hauing tasted both fortunes, made wise
by experience; or for his iustice and pie∣tie,
leauing behinde him full coffers, and
a plentifull treasure, hee died: for what
should we expect but all happie successe
from the Sonne of such a vertuous, such
a godly, and most religious Mother, as
was the Lady Margaret Countesse of Rich∣monde?
Now (in these our daies) wee see the
full accomplishing of all those blessings,
which were then onely in hope and ex∣pectation.
For in the person of our most
gracious King, besides all the blessings
which were contained in Henry, wee see
the perfect vniting of these kingdomes:
God forbid that I should any way para∣lell,
or make comparison betweene the
Graund-childe and his forefathers, this
were fitter to bee done betweene stran∣gers;
yet sure I am, that not in any one
propertie our Soueraigne comes short

of his Progenitors. For being to vnite
two seuerall Kingdomes, it pleased God
to giue him a disposition accordingly,
such an open and louing heart general∣ly
to all (as being to gouerne people of
diuers nations), that for the truth of his
loue and affection▪ the whole World, or
at least this whole Iland might not im∣properly
seeme to bee his natiue soyle;
such a bountifull and magnificent mind,
(as hauing many kingdomes to be the
obiects of his bountie), that infinite and
nūberlesse they are, who haue found the
sweete benefit of his beneuolence, either
for profit or honour, or both; besides
his wisdome and learning, wherein by
many degrees hee hath surpassed all his
Progenitors; his gouernement being a∣greeable
to his nature, so milde, so tem∣perate,
that it seemes to be paternall, as
if Iacob were now amongst his sonnes, and
had the promised land in possession. In so
much, that since his Maiesties most hap∣pie
ariuall to this kingdome, there hath

followed such a generall Peace, as that
for such a time wee neuer enioyed the
like: for here amongst our selues, not a∣ny
one of our Nobilitie hath suffered
death; the subiects in generall haue en∣ioyed
such a free course of iustice, and
such a secure time, that had it not beene
for the monster of our age, the most
horrible treason that euer was inuen∣ted
(the Gun-powder plot), assuredly we
should haue much doubted, whether it
were possible for the minde of man to
hatch any treason, against so louing, so
gracious, and such a mercifull Prince.
And in regard that this kingdome hath
alwaies swaied a great part of Christen∣dome,
and hath giuen lawes vnto o∣thers,
&c. it hath pleased God, that since
his Maiesties comming to the Crowne,
many bloodie warres haue been appsed
by his most gracious mediation; and
notwithstanding that the occasions did
often appeare, which did seeme to threa∣ten
blood-shed and warre, yet God in

his mercy hath so preuented it, as that
there was neuer conceiued such a gene∣rall
expectation of an vniuersall Peace to
ensue.
And whereas not any Nation vnder
the Sunne, hath heretofore so farre pre∣uailed
ouer this Iland, as the Danes; by
his Maiesties most happie Marriage,
wee are now secured from all feare, and
seeme to bee much strengthened by the
alliance of a most stoute and warlike
people; in so much that both for the en∣tire
loue, and brotherly affection to your
Maiestie, as likewise for the great ho∣nour
of this Kingdome, wee haue twice
seene, to our great ioy and comfort,
The most valiant and couragious Prince,
The high and mightie Christian the fourth,
King of Denmarke and Norwey; first ri∣ding
thorough our streetes in triumph,
(but in a peaceable triumph) since pri∣uilie
and vnexpectiuely surprising your
Maiesties person, (for the truth of loue
cannot alwaies stay the leisure to bee at∣tended

on with ceremonies). And thus
God to shew the perpetuall league and
couenant made with vs, hath so happi∣lie
contriued, that the meanes for our
perpetuall peace, might be for euer con∣tinued;
that Nation, which heretofore
hath been at our backs to pursue vs, now
stand like sure friends to backe and to
ayde vs.
For our most noble Prince Charles,
considering that the continuance of our
happinesse depends vpon his hope and
expectation, I will forbeare to speake;
onely thus much I may say, that being
descended from such noble Progeni∣tors,
as he partakes their nature, so their
vertues, carrying a name, which hath
beene most fortunate to the Christian
world, his naturall disposition and edu∣cation
being such, as seemes to promise
the enlarging of our happinesse; My
prayers shall be, that of this fruite, wee may
receiue fruite, and that from his lones these
kingdomes may bee for euer established and

knit together, as long as the Sunne and the
Moone shall endure.
To returne to your Maiestie, to whom
I doe owe my particular seruice: how∣soeuer
your Maiestie is no way desirous
to heare your owne due praise and com∣mendation,
chusing rather to practise,
then publish your vertues; yet I can
doe no lesse then acknowledge with
great ioyfulnesse of minde, with great
thankefulnesse to God, the many bles∣sings
wherewith it hath pleased God to
adorne your Maiestie. For what can
bee required in a Princesse, which God
hath no most plentifullie and in a full
measure imparted to your Maiestie,
so royallie and noblie descended, so
religious and deuoute in Gods seruice,
hauing such excellent gifts of nature
for your wisdome and vnderstanding,
and being euery way and in euery kinde
most vertuous in your selfe; your Ma∣iestie
did neuer fauour any, but those
that were trulie vertuous, and alwaies

haue fauoured those most, who were
indeede most vertuous; in so much that
being most free from all affectation
of popularitie (which sometimes pro∣ceedes
not from the best grounds), yet
your Maiestie hath alwaies been most
highly honoured, as generallie of all, so
especiallie of those who are truely ver∣tuous;
for your bountie, charitie, and
magnificēce, which appeare, as to all vpō
occasions, so more particularlie in hel∣ping
relieuing▪ giuing large and yeerely
pensions to the seruants of the late most
noble Prince Henry: for your iustice,
equitie, &c. not any Princesse in the
world did euer loue iustice more truely
and entirely then your Maiestie doth,
taking onelie the protection of iust
causes: insomuch that whereas many
thousands are bound dailie to pray
for your Maiestie; yet I may bold∣lie
speake it, that the corruption of
mans minde could neuer frame vnto
it selfe, the lest seeming or supposed oc∣casion

of complaint or grieuance.
These blessings being such and so
great, I could doe no lesse then remem∣ber
them to Gods glorie, your Maie∣sties
honour, and to our great comfort,
beseeching God to continue them, daily
to inlarge them, and to make vs thanke∣full
for them; and here I doe most hum∣blie
desire your Maiestie to pardon my
boldnesse, in presenting these my vn∣worthie
labours, and together with
them my selfe, and all my endeuours to
your most gracious seruice and prote∣ction;
most earnestly beseeching your
Maiestie to accept of them, though I
doe truely and from my heart acknow∣ledge,
that they are all, most vnworthie
of your acceptation; yet in recompence
thereof, I will humbly beseech God in
my dailie prayers, to blesse and preserue
the Kings Highnesse, your Maiestie, our
noble Prince Charles, the Prince and
Princesse Palatine, with their issue, toge∣ther
with that most royall stocke and fa∣milie,

from whence your Maiestie is de∣scended▪
that God in his mercie would
giue vnto you all the blessings of nature
abundantlie, the present earnest of
his grace, and the future pos∣session
of his
glory.
