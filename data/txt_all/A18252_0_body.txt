MADAME, Though heauē hath propitiously disposed
 your well-rectifyed Soule to Piety, and that many books of this kind want not to entertain your pious retirements, in the sweet solitude of Me∣ditation; yet may I boldly say, this Ma∣nual of deuotiō hath somewhat new, and attractiue in it, to
 add increase of fer∣uour to your best progressions; & will (I doubt not) vnder the happy patronage of your Honour (as from so noble an ex∣ample) gaine the se∣rious attention, and good opinion of ma∣ny, who shal read it. Congested Rules, &
 multiplicity of pre∣cepts, which onely augment the bulke of Bookes, and little edify, or informe the mind, are heere purposely auoyded. Short acts of Deuoti∣on, and pious aspira∣tions more penetrate and being (as in this Diurnall) put into
 method, winne vpō the drowzy soule, & opē the hart to more awakened thoughts of saluation. My ay∣me in this Transla∣tion, excellent Lady, is your particular cō∣tentement, and con∣sequently in some measure to discharge the obligation I owe
 to your much Ho∣noured Family, the known worth wher∣of, though it can re∣ceaue little illustra∣tion from the weake indeauours of mypē; yet, should I not at least, thus gratefully remember it, hauing so fayre an opportu∣nity, as this present
 Dedication, would make him guilty of ingratitude, who with his readiest ser∣uice resolues euer to remayne,
