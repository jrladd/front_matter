MAy it please your Hon.
The obseruation which
this world begets, may
teach experience truly
to report, that Loue and
Charity are for the most
part growne so cold, e∣uen
in the hotest Sun-shine of our Profession,
as that despised Pouertie, though addicted
to the Religious exercise of endeuors cōmen∣dable,
is in the best employment (vvhich
seemes vvith greatest Fauor to smile vpon his
Hope) so coldly recompenced, as that poore
vnpitied deiected miserable Pouertie knowes
neither Meanes nor Place how or vvhere to
warme it selfe.
Vnhappie I, in this best time of greatest
happines, who being as I am a Poore dispi∣sed,
hated, scorned, and vnrespected Souldier
so vnfortunate as no commended meanes,
though many vsed, with confirmation both
of loue and Loyaltie, can bee of power from
dispayers Gulfe, to raise a Spirit drowned, in
worst of misery: but were I not indeered
vnto those by heauen made mine, who are
indeed, to me, thē life, more deare from whō
there is no way to run, vnlesse in me, selfe be∣ing
be disolued, I would assueredly by hea∣uens
assistance in some honest War with vse
of Armes, giue to my life so long as I should
liue, a liuing maintenance: but novv Immu∣red
in my natiue home, vnseperably Yoakt
vvith leane-fac't pouertie. I haue experience
to conclude that as it is most certaine Pax
Procreat Bellum, so is it no lesse true, that a
confirmed Peace, Non amat Fillios belli, vntill
she hath need of them.
In this estate no knovving hovv to mēd
my selfe, Religious Lavve shall make my re∣solution
honest, & though Rerum conditio∣nem
mutare non possum, yet I vvill haue povver
to say Hoc possum magnum sumere animam et
viro forti dignum, vvith patience therefore

shal my grieued thoghts ioyfully be throvvn
vpō my makers prouidēce by vvhose assist∣ance
I vvill still resolue vvith a constant Bo∣sōe
to persist in the prosecution of commen∣ded
deeds, for this I knovv Spes mea, Christo
viuens, Est viuere vt semper viuam.
And thus, my Honorable Lord, hauing
breathed forth a sight vnto the grace of your
compassionate respect: I humbly craue your
Honor vvill vouchsafe, to patronize in this
little booke (by me collected) not my ovvne
but the vvords of that reuerend and learned
Iudge, the Lord Coke, vvho at his coming to
Norwich, did at the Assises therevpon the
bench, deliuer a charge so exelent as that it
vvorthyly deserues to be continued in per∣petuall
memorie, vvhich being thus produ∣sed
to a publique vievv, I hope it shall vnto
our Publickeweale remaine a vvorthy perse∣dent,
vvherein Romes champions may vvith
shame decerne their long continued shame∣full
practices, Puritans & Sismatickes learne
to konvve vvith vvhat Iniustice they di∣sturbe
the happinesse of our most hap∣pie
peace, our Iustices, inferior officers, Iu∣rors,
and Commons generally, may in this
booke find out commended documents and
instructiōs profitable as vvel directing hovv

to gouern as to be gouerned: all which par∣ticulars
the learned Iudge hath wisely hādled
with such plausible Oratorical wisdomes elo∣quence,
as that vvhen I heard him speake, I
thought the Poet had iust cause to say, Pros∣pera
lux orritur linguis{que} animis{que} fauete; Nam
dicenda bono sunt bona verba die. If therfore in
this following worke my Memorie hath gi∣uen
a true instruction to my pen, I hope my
labour shalbe accoūted profitable, vvhen it
administers a Publique benefit.
Thus Right Hon. Earle, what I haue here∣into
performed, together with my most vn∣vvorthy
selfe, I humbly referre vnto your
Honoured wisdomes consideration, remai∣ning
as I will alwayes rest,
