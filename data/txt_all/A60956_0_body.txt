My Lord,
THE Particular Acquaintance and Friendship which your Grace was pleased to Honour me with, while you lived at Oxford, have emboldened me  address my self to your Lordship at this great distance of Place, and greater of Con∣dition, in hopes that by your Grace's Ad∣vancement to so high a Station in the Church, That, which before was onely Friendship, may now Improve into Patronage and Pro∣tection. And yet, as Ambitious as I am of so ennobling a Patronage, and as singular a Value as I have for your Grace's Favour, I

must needs own, that the Design of my pre∣sent Application to your Grace, is not so much to Crave a Favour, as to pay a Debt: and, in answer to the many obligations I lie under, to Congratulate your Grace that height of Dignity and Greatness, to which Providence has so happily raised you, and your own Worth so justly entituled you, and so, with∣out your seeking (and much less sneaking) for it, made you, to your great Honour, to be sought for by it: There being (as from my heart I believe) few Examples in the World, of so much Merit, and so much Modesty in Conjunction.
It is indeed no small Infelicity to the Church of England, to have parted with so Extraordinary a Member; but none at all I conceive to your Grace, that you are placed, where you are; Especially, if your Grace shall Consider, the present estate of our Church here, as through the Arts of her Enemies she stands divided against Her self: and that only by Two, or Three Odd New Terms of Distinction maliciously invented, and Studi∣ously made use of for that base Purpose; such a Sovereign, or at least such a peculiar, method

have some found out for preserving our Church, if the best way to preserve a Body, be by Cutting it a sunder. For those of the Ancienter Members of Her Communion who have all along owned and contended for a strict Conformity to Her Rules and Sanctions, as the surest Course to establish Her, have been of late represented, or rather Reprobà∣ted under the Inodiateing Character of High Churchmen, and thereby stand marked out for all the discouragement that Spight, and Power together can pas upon them; while those of the Contrary Way and Principle are Distinguished, or rather Sanctifyed, by the fashionable Endearing Name of Low Churchmen; not from their affecting (we may be sure) a Lower Condition in the Church than others; (since none lie so low but they can look as high) but from the Low Condition, which the Authors of this Di∣stinction would fain bring the Church it self into: A Work, in which they have made no small Progress already. And thus by these Vngenerous, as well as Vnconscionable Pra∣ctices, a Fatal Rent and Division is made amongst us: and, being so, I think, those

of the Concision who made it, would do well to Consider, whether that, which our Sa∣viour assures us, will destroy a Kingdom, be the likeliest way to settle and support a Church. But I question not, but these Divi∣ders will very shortly receive Thanks from the Papists for the Good Services they have done them; and in the mean time they may be sure of their Scoffs.
Never certainly were the Fundamental Ar∣ticles of our Faith so boldly impugned, nor the Honour of our Church so fouly blemished, as they have been of late Years; while the Socinians have had their full Vncontrolled Fling at Both; and the Tritheists, have in∣jured and exposed them more by pretending to defend them against the Socinians, than the Socinians themselves did, or could do, by opposing them. For surely it would be thought a very odd way of ridding a Man of the Plague by running Him through with a Sword; or of Curing Him of a Lethargy by casting Him into a Calenture; a Disease of a Contrary Nature indeed, but no less Fatal to the Patient; who equally dies whether his Sickness or his Physick, the malignity of his

Distemper, or the method of his Cure dis∣patches him. And in like manner must it fare with a Church, which feeling it self struck with the Poyson of Socinianism, flies to Tritheism for an Antidote.
But at length happily steps in the Royal Authority to the Church's Relief, with se∣veral Healing Injunctions, in its Hand, for the Composing and Ending the Disputes about the Trinity then on foot; and those indeed so wisely framed, so seasonably timed, and (by the King at least) so graciously in∣tended, that they must in all Likelihood (with∣out any Other Irenicon) have restored Peace to the Church, had it not been for the Impor∣tunity and Partiality of some, who having by the Awe of these Injunctions endeavoured to si∣lence the opposite Party (which by their Argu∣ments they could not do,) and withal looking upon themselves as Privileged Persons, and so above those Ordinances, which others were to be subject to, Resolved not to be silent themselves; but renewing the Contest, partly by throwing Muggleton, and Rigaltius, with some Other foul stuff in their Adversa∣ries faces; and partly by a shameless Reprint∣ing

(without the least Reinforcing) the same exploded Tritheistick Notions again and again, they quite broke through the Royal Prohibitions, and soon after began to take as great a Liberty in venting their In∣novations and Invectives, as ever they had done before; so that He, who shall Im∣partially Consider the Course taken by these Men with reference to those engaged on the other side of this Controversy about the Tri∣nity, will find that their whole Proceeding in it resembles nothing so much, as a Thief's binding the hands of an honest Man with a Cord, much fitter for his own Neck.
But, blessed be God, matters stand not so with you in Ireland; the Climate there being not more Impatient of Poysonous Ani∣mals, than the Church of Poysonous Opi∣nions; An Vniversal Concurrent Orthodoxy shining all over it, from the superiour Clergy who preside, to the Inferiour placed under them: so that we never hear from thence of any Presbyter, and much less of any Dean, who dares Innovate upon the Faith Received: and least of all (should such a Wretch chance to start up amongst you) can I hear of any

Bishop likely to debase his Style and Cha∣racter so low as either to Defend the Man, or Colour over his Opinions. Nor lastly do we find, that, in the Iudgment of the Clergy there, a Man' having wrote a∣gainst one sort of Heresy or Heterodoxy, ought to Iustifie or Excuse Him in Writ∣ing for Another; and much less for a Worse.
The Truth is, such Things as these make the Case with us here in England Come too near that of Poland about an Hun∣dred and Twenty or Thirty Years ago; See a Learned Tract in 8•o. Intituled, The Growth of Error, &c. Sect. 8. Printed in the Year, 1697. Where the Doctrine of Three distinct infinite Spirits began, and led the Dance; and was quickly followed (as the Design was laid) by Soci∣nianism. Whereupon, their old Popery got a firmer establishment, and more rigorous Im∣position than before: (the Government pre∣ferring a less Pure, and Perfect Christianity before the most refined Turcism.) This was the method taken there, and I wish it may not have the like Issue here.
But on the Contrary amongst You, when a

Certain Mahometan Christian (No new thing of late), Notorious for his Blasphemous Denyal of the Mysteries of our Religion, and his Insufferable Virulence against the whole Christian Priesthood, thought to have found shelter amongst you, the Parlia∣ment to their Immortal Honour, Pre∣sently sent him Packing, and without the help of a Faggot soon made the Kingdom too Hot for him. A sufficient Argument Doubt∣less, how far we are from needing those savage Executions, used by the Papists to Rid the Church of Hereticks and Blasphe∣mers, where Authority Animated with due Zeal will attempt that worthy Work, by o∣ther more Humane, but not less effectual means. Nothing Certainly but Power, as the World now goes, can keep the Church in Peace.
And now, My Lord, may that God by whom Princes and Prelate's Govern, and Churches stand, long preserve Your Grace, and that Excellent Church, which you are so eminent a Pillar of, and Ornament to; and which by Her Incomparable Courage and Faithfulness lately shewn in preserving

that Great Depositum, the Holy Religion Committed to her Trust, has gotten her self a Name, which will never die; and such a solid well-founded Reputation, as no Bend∣ing this way or that way, no Trimming or Tricking it, ever could or can give so Ample and so Considerable a Body. For it is Lead only that Bends to almost every Thing, which the Nobler Metals cannot do, and the Nobler sort of minds will not.
But I fear, I trespass too far upon Your Grace's Time and Business; And therefore humbly imploring Your Grace's blessing, I lay these Poor Papers at Your feet; infinite∣ly Vnworthy, I Confess, of the Acceptance of so great a Person, and the Perusal of so Iudicious an Eye, but yet, at present, the best pledges I can give Your Grace of those sincere Respects, and Services, which Your Grace ought always to Claim, and shall never fail to Receive, from,
My Lord,

Westminster April 30. 1698.
