TO manifest the poore good will & dutifull loue I owe thee (O famous and re∣nowmed Englande). for that I perceiue thine extremities are dangerous, I haue presumed (though more presumptuous I confes then skil∣full) to present thee with this potion, compounded of gentle persuasions and charitable exhortations, whiche al∣though it be somewhat bitter and vn∣pleasant to thy taste, yet doubte I not (it being taken as it ought) but in ope∣ration



it will effect thine amendment, or at least expell (in some measure) the mischeeuous humors that causeth thy drowsinesse, and procureth thy dan∣ger. And that it may so doe: I will not cease to praie vnto him that ney∣ther slumbreth nor sleepeth, but wat∣cheth ouer thee vigilantlie for thy peace and safetie, who is al in al, and thy God for euer.
He that is alwaies prest to die to shield thee from danger: Iohn Dauies:
