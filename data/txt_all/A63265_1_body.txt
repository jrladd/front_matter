SIR,
W'Orthy Presents are received for their own value; mean ones (if at all) for his sake that bestows them: I will not then dispair of kind Enter∣tainment from you, since you have been pleased not to account me unwelcome to your self. The favours from your Noble Father, and your self Oblieges me to this dutious offering: And if you deny not it what you have vouchsafed to me, it shall be my care to render my self gratefull by a more worthy Pre∣sent.

In the mean time, these may serve as Sallats, to provoke the Appetite of a young wit: I dare not commend them to you to feed on, since the smallest fragment that falls from the Banquet of your Fancy, the nicest Pallat may feast with. And therefore be pleased to admit me, if for no in∣trinsique worth of my own, yet in regard I have the virtue to admire yours.
Your ever Honourer▪
