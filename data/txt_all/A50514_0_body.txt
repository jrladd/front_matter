My Lord,
THE Natural way of Learning all Arts and Sciences, is to know, First, the Terms used in them, and the Principles upon which they are founded, with the Origins of the one, and the Reasons of the other. A Collecti∣on of these Terms and Principles is in Law called, Institutions; and the Natural and Easie way of Writing these, is by going

from the first Principle to a second, and from that to a third: The admir'd Method of Euclid in his Elements, though much neglected by all, who have written Insti∣tutions of Law; in which, not onely many things unnecessary are insert, as almost all the third book of Justinians Institutions; the Differences betwixt the Sabiniani and Proculiani, &c. Many Fundamental Titles are ommit∣ted, as all the matter of Restitu∣tions: And many things are taught in the first Book, which cannot be understood till the fourth be read.
I have therefore in these my Insti∣tutions treated nothing save Terms, and Principles, leaving out nothing that is necessary, and inserting no∣thing that is contraverted; in all which I have proceeded, building alwayes one Principle upon another;

and expressing every thing in the Terms of the Civil Law, or in the Stile of Ours respectively; so that if any Man understand fully this Little Book; Natural Rea∣son, and Thinking, will easily sup∣ply much of what is diffused, through our many Volums of Trea∣tises, and Decisions; Whereas the studying those, would not in many years give a true Idea of our Law; and does rather distract than instruct. And I have often observed, that moe Lawyers are ignorant for not understanding the first Principles, than for not having read many Books; as it is not the having travelled long, but the ha∣ving known the way, which brings a man to his Lodging soon, and securely.
My Lord, You observ'd very justly to me, that Institutions are a Grammar; and therefore,

(which is a great encouragement to all Readers of Institutions,) they who understand the Instituti∣ons of any one Nation, will soon learn the Law of any other: For though Terms, Forms, and Cu∣stoms differ; yet the great Principles of Iustice and Equity are the same in all Nations. I send mine therefore to your Lordship, not be∣cause you need them, but that you may judge, if my Institutions, will be able to justifie your parallel.
Nec Phoebo gratior ulla est, Quam sibi quae Vari praescrip∣sit pagina Nomen.
