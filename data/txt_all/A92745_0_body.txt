Right Honourable,
YOur Honor being the chiefest Treasurer of the Weal-publicke of this City, I amongst the subscriptions and contri∣butions of well affected persons, have in this Booke, like the Widow, offered into your Treasury but only two mites of Service and Duty, and for it doe most humbly pray your gracious favour, and your Honours good acceptance. I know it will appeare strange unto some, who if they dis∣like my industry, and distaste my zeale, I esteem them on∣ly tanquam pedarios sensores, trampling on the truth of the Cause, and carrying their eyes in their heeles, and not in their heads, kicking and spurning at all zealous and well affected Patriots. But those malignant humours
are so farre from me, and my intents, that in publishing this booke, I have scattered abroad the fire of my zeale to shew it selfe in its owne shine, and placed my happinesse in your Honours approving my endeavours. I have verily cast into your Treasury as much as I could, and for my part doe judge it every mans part to depart from all where hee oweth all that is for the good and safety of the Common∣wealth and the City, which to advance your Honour hath, and doth most Religiously and stoutly endeavour. To this I can only adde my dayly prayers, and will still power them forth to the God of all glory and mercy, that his manifold and dayly blessings may be multiplied upon your Honour, for your great viligilancy and care over this great City in these imminent times of Danger, while I desire your ap∣probation of this testimony of my zeale to your Honour, and presume to subscribe myselfe, your Honours most humble servant,
