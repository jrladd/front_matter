HAve at you Sirs, 'tis but a word or two,
And that's enough, if not too much for you;
You that pretend Religion, and why?
To make Religion cloake your villany;
You that pretend the publike good, but how?
Just as the Pigs that whine to sucke the Sow;
You men-devouring-beasts, you ne'r-be-good,
Will nothing please you but our all-hearts-blood?
No wonder that sweet England seemes a hell,
When you sit Judges in our Israel:
What e're you thinke, we think you mad or worse,
D'e hope to fatten still byth' peoples curse?
Foxes indeed fare best when wisht a rope,
But you'l unkennel'd be e're long wee hope:
And then (what then) 'twill be such sport, that O,
Acteons Dogges ne're us'd their Master so.
