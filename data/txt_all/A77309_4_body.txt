Worthy Sir,
THough my Memory labour∣eth under much Weakness, Can I ever forget the En∣couragement which my Ministry met with (in Times sufficiently discou∣raging) at the Beloved Oaks? where some of the Truths presented in the Printed Sheets, came to the Ears, yea, and (as I believe) to the Hearts of you, and your then precious Bosome-relation, who has for some Years layen in the Bosome of Abra∣ham. I am assured, you will not despise the Day of Small Things; you will look with favour on his hand, whose age and infirmities have (of late) hindred your seeing his face. May you whose self-denyal is exem∣plary (as is also your bounty) be blessed, and a great blessing! May your dear Children (Children of the Covenant) and all your Relations prosper! May the Church that is (and that meets) in your house have in it a special presence of God! So prayeth, Endeared Sir, much obliged
