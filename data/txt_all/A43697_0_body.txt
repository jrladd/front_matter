SInce your Lordship has sentenc'd this discourse to the Press, I shall no longer dispute your Com∣mands; but according to the true character of an English Subject, ha∣ving already asserted my liberty in the free∣dom of a defence, I must leave the final de∣termination to the Higher powers: Thus manifesting my Obedience without betraying my Birthright. I know the many censures which a discourse of this nature is liable unto,
 and therefore in publishing of it, I have given an instance of that sincerity and boldness, to which I exhorted others; but having justice on my side, and your Lordship for my Advo∣cate, I shall need no other Apology to recom∣mend me to the favour of good men, or pro∣tect me from the detractions of the mali∣cious.
My Lord,
