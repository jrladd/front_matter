MY worthlesse pen Presumeth to deuise,
To eternize Your peerles vertuus fame,
In holy flame Of zeale my hart doth rise,
VVhich doth dispise A thame of vulgar frame,
The sacred dame The graces haue select,
That should protect The heire Muses hill,
Whose Phoenix quil Doth heauenly Crowne affect,
And those hath dect VVhich Romane Trophies fill.
Heauens do distill Their happie influence,
As come froÌ„ thence, You there your portion haue,
Ioue long you saue, VVhose Scepters you dispence,
For whose defence, True English hearts he gaue,
Venus wold craue, And Dian doth that due,
Which Pallas wils Me yeeld alone to you.
