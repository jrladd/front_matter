THE Epistle Dedicatory. To the Right Honourable and very noble Ladies, my Lady Dutches of Rothes, and her Graces Eldest Daughter the Countess of Rothes, who Christianly ambitions it, as her greatest honour in following the Lord, to tread in the footâˆ£steps of her living noble Mother, and of her deceast Grand-Mother, the Countess of Crafurd, Sister-German to the two Illustrious Princes, James and William late Dukes of Hamilton, and of Her great Grand-Mother my Lady Boid, all three eminent Paterns of Piety in their day.
