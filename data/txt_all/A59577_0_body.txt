Right Honourable,
THE following Discourse was ne∣ver designed to go further than your own Chappel, otherwise it had not been left so Imperfect: But since you have thought fit to Order it should be more Publick, it would ill become me, who
do in it so earnestly press Obedience to Superiours, to dispute your Commands. Such therefore as it is, I humbly present it to you, heartily wishing it may in some degree mi∣nister to the Promoting Peace and Unity, and Brotherly Love among us, which is the only thing therein aimed at, by
Right Honourable,
