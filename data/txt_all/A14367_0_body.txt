HEre haue I added, right honourable Lorde, vnto my treatises of predesti∣nation, and of free wyll, a small booke, whiche I haue entituled: The ouer throwe of the iustificati∣on of workes, and of the vayne doctryne of the merites of men, with the true asser∣tion of the iustification of fayeth, and of the good workes that do proceade of the same, and in what respecte our good wor∣kes are rewarded or crouned of God: be∣cause that these doctrines, do so depende one of an other, that they can in no wyse be separated, or put a sunder, onlesse we wyll wante the perfecte vnderstandinge of them all, and so be blynde styll in the cheyfest and moste principall poyntes of oure relygion. Of predestination, howe
 frutefull and necessarye the doctrine of it, is, what so euer the swynishe gruntynge Epicures, and carnall worldelinges, doth saye to the contrary, I wyl speake nothing nowe at this presente, because that I am fullye determined, by the healpe and assi∣staunce of the holye spirite of God, short∣lye to set foorthe an Apologye or defence of my doctrine, touchinge that poynte of our religion, beyng directed to the quenes maiestye, vnto whome the treatyse ther∣of is dedicated. Neyther do I nede great∣lye to speake of the doctrine of free wyll sythe that in the settinge foorthe of it, I haue so tempered my style, that I kepte my selfe alwayes within the lymites and boundes of Gods worde, goinge neyther on the ryghte nor on the lefte hande, but walkinge styll in that most sure and plain hyghe waye, that the Patriarches, Pro∣phettes, and Apostels, wyth the Godlye aunciente wryters of the primitiue church had alreadye trodden or beaten vnto vs. Many obiections of the Popepelagians, and free wyllmen of our tyme, which ne∣uer were touched before, haue I fully an∣swered in it, as it shall playnlye appeare vnto them, that wyll wyth a syngle eye, and with an vprighte iudgement, reade the whole treatise. The only marke that I shoote at in all these woorkes, is that the grace of God, maye be throughlye mag∣nified, and the vayne gloryinge of men, in theyr owne strength, which all thinges
 beynge rightly considered, and diligently wayed, is nothinge at al) beinge taken a∣waye, the whole glorye of oure saluation shuld be geuen only vnto the mercy & good¦nes of our heauenly father▪ who as by the death passion & bloudshedding of his son Iesu Christ, doeth fully saue vs, so by his holye spirit he doeth regenerate vs, and takinge awaye our stony heartes from vs, he geueth vs fleshy hearts, that is obedy∣ente and treatable: he maketh vs of vn∣wyllinge, wyllinge▪ of the bounde slaues of synne, the seruauntes of his sonne Ie∣su Christ, for to serue him in holynesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of oure lyfe, and so brynginge vs in to the free∣dome of the children of God (for where the spirit of the Lord is, there is fredome) he maketh vs to walke in those good wor∣kes, that he hath prepared for vs to walke in. Neyther can it iustely be sayed, that eyther in my booke of predestination, or in my booke of free wyll, I did minister to any man occasion, eyther to lyue lycen∣tiouslye, asthough it made no matter how they lyue, that are by the immutable de∣cree of God, ordayned vnto lyfe euerla∣stinge, or to beslacke in doynge of those good woorkes, that are required of vs in Goddes booke. Whiche all menne shall moste euidently see (excepte they wyll be wylfullye blinde) by this booke, that now at this present, I haue set foorth, and de∣dicated
 vnto your honourable Lordship, whom I see of all men to be most earnest∣lye geuen vnto good letters, and moste principally to the study of the holy and sa¦cred scriptures. Which, as it is a thinge verye rare amonge the greatest part of the noble men of our tyme: so wyl it be a most precious ornamente, bothe to you, and to to the honourable stocke that ye come of. For, what greater cōmendacion can there be to suche as ye are, than to haue a know∣ledge and vnderstandinge of the liberall sciences, and of the tonges, that they be written in: and specially to be so acquain∣ted wyth the infallible worde of God, the onlye Antidotus or conterpoyson, against all venimous sects and heresyes, that ye shal at all tymes be able mightely to with∣stande all false and erroneous doctrines, that by the procuremente of Sathane the deuyll the enemye of oure saluation, haue heretofore rysen and doo daylye ryse in Christes church? I do here let passe, how muche good ye wyll do by youre good ex∣ample, vnto those that are of the basseste sort, when they see your Lordship to be so seriously geuen, to suche vertuous excerci∣ses. it wyll be an wonderfull encorage∣mente vnto them: and vnto the other, that be of the same degree that ye are of, or of an higher, a marueylous prickinge forre∣wardes. For, if ther be any sparke or drop of Godly shamefastenes in them they wil blushe and be ashamed, when they shall
 heare you grauely and learnedly to reason of highe matters of learninge and of the principall poynts of our religion, to stand lyke domme and paynted ymages, and a∣ble to saye nothinge. Therfore go on styll, as ye haue Godlye begonne: beinge most sure, that he which hath of his free mercy and goodnesse begonne this good worke in you, by his holy spirit styrring vp your hearte to such Godly studyes: wyll short∣lye performe it, and bringe to suche a per∣fect end that it wyl be not onely to your e∣uerlastinge comforte, but also to the vn∣speakeable vtility vnd profit of your own naturall contrey. I woulde haue declared brieflye, what be the chiefest poyntes, that I do entreate of in this my boke, but because that the argumente of it, is set foorth afore the beginninge of the whole woorke, I haue thought it vnnecessarye. Here therfore, wyll I make an ende, most humblye besechinge your good Lordship too take this my symple laboure in good parte, not so much consideringe the small∣nesse of the gyfte, as the heart, and pure good wyll or zeale of the geuer. Thus the eternal and euerlasting god preserue bothe youre good Lordshippe, and my good ladye youre wyfe, wyth all youre Godlye famylye and house∣hold.
