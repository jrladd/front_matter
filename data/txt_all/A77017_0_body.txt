IF that (much honoured Sir) I should here prefix any long narration in commendati∣on of your Worth, I should of some be sus∣pected of flattery; of all it would seeme a thing superfluous, seeing it sufficiently commends it selfe? such is your Worth, that who so readeth you throughout, cannot but entertain honourable and pious thoughts of you: your deserts of Gods Church, your singular zeale, your unfained faith, your sincere profession, your especiall care to advance Gods glory, and to root out Papistry, your constant faith∣fulnesse to your King and Parliament, hath beene such, that this Kingdome generally, but the County of Berks especially (your native soyle) have and shall have great cause to blesse God for you; hoping yet better and grea∣ter things; and that their hopes may meet with fruition, they have joyntly with one heart and tongue chosen you, (being worthy double honour) Knight of the shiere; and which justly speaks observation, no negative voice heard; which clearly proclaimes to the world, your sensible good∣nesse

and deserts for the time past; Their great and glorious hope, that the Lord will make You an instrumentall Bles∣sing, not onely to the whole Realme, but especially to them ana their County, for the future. Now, that this expe∣ctation may come into their hands, you have the tongues and hearts of all; of all, except some few of Nadabs and Abihu's sect, such as offer often times strange fire upon Gods Al∣tar; they indeed breath out flames endeavouring to singe and search you, your visible goodnesse, and apparent ver∣tues: oh, what will not Ignorance and Malice, (especially if infected with our Kingdoms new disease) dare attempt? what speech of wisedome can be so discreetly uttered, but it may by Ignorance be depraved? what action of vertue can be so exactly performed, but it may through Malice be mis-construed? It is not more proper to God to bring light one of darkenesse, than it is naturall for the Devill and his turbulent Imps out of the light of truth to endeavour to draw darkenesse of errour, and out of the best speeches and actions to straine and force out somewhat, to maintaine and nourish their corrupt humours and bosome sinnes. And what marvell? sith even in Paradise amidst the sweetest flowers and herbs a Serpent could live▪ and find there some∣thing to feed upon, turning the  of those soveraigne and medle shall simples into poyson; but expelling these, I hasten unto that whereof I am chiefly to speake.
I am, honoured Sir, as full of hope as desire, that your countenance will helpe into the light, this bashfull piece of my composure? your Affection, and more then common kindnesse unto me hath emboldened mee to beseech that you will Patronie this first fruit of my endeavours; as I shall not here remember all the favours wherewith I have been honoured, so can I not forget to mention some, especially those reflections and glissonings (which in due re∣spect to you) shone on me, from that great starre lately

fallen (the able and reverend Doctor, the faithfull and worthy Prolocutor Master William Twisse) as, his last judi∣cious and elaborate Book, which he so willingly gave me with his own hand; his thinking me Worthy (though un∣worthy) to succeed him as Pastor of Newbury, signed with his own hand; his giving me the free use of his rich and learned Library; under the Sunshine of these beams (dart∣ed on me (right Worshipfull) for your sake) have I lately lived; so that, it may be expected somewhat of mine should be coloured with them. indeed the Argument be∣ing an Assembly act, might therefore claim a peculiar in∣terest in a Prolocutours religious Protection; but the for∣mer causes have invited, nay inforced me, humbly to de∣sire yours: Whose protection should I rather beg then his that hath made me happy both in affection and action? such is your known goodnesse, as that it is not onely ex∣tended to me, but fastened on all those that sincerely feare God (which makes the publick Good) with affecti∣ons (like the beames of the Sun) immutable, unchangeable; marke the rayes of the visible Sunne, how constant they are, being not moved at all by the motion of the object, but immoveably flowing from the Body of the Sunne, though blustering winds tyrannize in the ayre, and remove it a thousand times out of his place in an houre, yet the Sunne beames keepe their object which they enlighten, and stirre not at all; in like manner, your affections (honoured Sir) like thc beames of the Sunne remaine unmoveable where they are once fixed, though blustering winds have tyrannized, and tossed You, your Person, your good-name, your most godly, most humble, and devout Lady, your well-governed Family, your great estate, &c. yet your pious heart and religious affections have remained unmoveable; witnesse your cheer∣full constancy to your Christ and his cause from the first to the last; this is that which (more especially) adds unto my

hopes; nay, its that that makes me confident, that these few labours will find a gracious acceptance being humbly pre∣sented to your Indulgency and Gentlenesse. I conclude, fea∣ring prolixity; the Lord of Heaven blesse you, and grant as you have beene heretofore faithfull, just, and wise; so you may continue to the glory of God, the increasing of his Church, and the profit of his People.
