Right Honorable,
GIue mee leaue to present only to your View, that which you heard not long since distractedly vttered. I haue ever ob∣serued your extraordina∣ry favours toward me, which I wish I could as well deserue, as thankefully ac∣knowledge. When importunity therefore had extorted from me, the publishing of
these troubled Meditations; I could not bee to seeke of a Patron: Your Heroicall dispo∣sition in generall, and particular respect to mee, being so fresh in memory. Weake frames need the stronger supporters; and of∣ten times a poore Pamphlet becommeth passable by a rich frontispice. I desire this may be admitted not as an acquittance for former debts, but an obligation for future payment: which were I as able as ready, should not bee long behind. But where true Noblenesse is radicall, harmelesse pre∣sumption, and vngarded plainnesse for want of Court complement, seldome meets with a checke. This emboldens mee to depend on your tryed acceptance; who am
Oxford, Exeter Col∣ledge. Octob. 22. 1624.
