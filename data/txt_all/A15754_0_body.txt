HAuing long desired (as dutie bindes me Right worshipfull) to make knowen my gratefull minde, not onely to the Right worshipfull your good father of late memory (who during his naturall life was to his Prince a faithfull, true, and loyall subiect: to his country, a righteous and fa∣uourable iustice: to the Gospell of Christ a godly and zealous professour: to all good men, a gentle and louing benefactor: and to me a sure and speciall friend) but also to your selfe, whose wonted courtesies, and friendly countenance, euen from your child-hood, hath moued me (for want of better) to de∣dicate vnto your worship this litle booke: as a true token and testimony of the faithfull

and heartie good will, I haue alwaies borne to you and your house and shall during life: contayning certaine necessarie rules, touch∣ing both Christian dutie and ciuill courtesie, profitable to many, delightfull to some, and offensiue to none: but curious Momus, dis∣dainefull Zoilus, and fleering Sycophant whelps, who with the blear-eyed Owle, be∣ing blinded with malice, blush not to accuse euen the bright sun-shine in others, making euery straw a stumbling blocke, euere mole∣hill, a mountaine, and euery vertue a vanitie: beseeching your worship to except it as wil∣lingly as I offer it faithfully. Thus resting with this perswasion, that the noble minde is alwaies more courteous, to winke at a fault and take things in good part, than the baser sort, I humbly take my leaue.
