My Lords,
MY Duty and Affection obliges me to Dedicate these Acts and De∣cisions
to your Lordships, because they are your own; I have
only been your Servant in Observing and Collecting them, and
am confident, they will serve for the Illustration and Vindication of your
Justice, and Faithfulness in your Service to the King and Kingdom, to whom
it cannot but be highly acceptable and satisfying to see, that in so long a tract

of time, you have kept so steady and equal a course in the Administration of
Justice with .
It hath been looked upon as the priviledge of Judges to bring in Causes to
be determined, in what order they thought fit, which gave occasion of great
Reverence to, and dependence upon them, and of gratifications to their Friends,
but your Lordships having found so much inconveniency to the Subjects, by
their tedious, expensive, and uncertain attendence, unavoidable in that way,
you did therefore willingly, and of your proper motion quite that Priviledge,
and ordered that all men should have dispatch in Justice, as their own dili∣gence
put them in readiness to demand it, without pretence of complaint for
being postponed or delayed; and you gave the rise for interposing the Autho∣rity
of Parliament to that Order, which could not but avoid the suspition of
inequality, which did occur, while every Judge in his course, did choise at
discretion what Causes to hear, which were readily supposed to be these of his
Friends and Relations.
As your Lordships have been equal in the Order, so these Decisions will
show that you have been impartial in the matter of Justice, and it will appear
that you have followed the same uniform Course of Justice, otherwise it had
been impossible for you to quadrat with your selves, if you had followed any
other Rule; for if personal Interest had great influence, it could not fail but
the same case, would have been diversly determined amongst different Par∣ties:
The way of Truth and Justice is one, and never crosseth or justeth with
it self; but the way of Error and Partiality is infinite, and can never be long
consonant, and the pretence of varying upon differences in the cases will easi∣ly
be perceived, when these are not the true motives of Variation, nor can the
greatest caution keep former Cases so in memory, as not to fall in flat contra∣dictions
in some length of time, when Justice is not the Rule; It was no won∣der
that inconsistencies did occur, when former Decisions were but little
known, and were only Transmitted by uncertain Tradition, from the memo∣ry
of Judges or Advocats, where a constant Custom was not introduced;
but in circumstantiat Cases, all the points of Fact, could not be so preserved, but
Pleaders would differ about them, and controvert whether the difference were
so material as to be the just motives of alteration; and if they should have recourse

to Records, they could thence have little remedy, seing many eminent De∣cisions
came to be Transacted before any Act or Decreet thereupon were Re∣corded,
and though they were, yet the Motives upon which the Lords did
proceed were seldom decernable in the mass of Disputes. The contrarieties
that are remarked by the judicious and industrious Lord Dury (who did serve
and observe about the same length of time that I have done) are the more ex∣cuseable,
that before his time the Decisions of Session were not much marked,
and but in few hands, yea it was a long time before the Decisions observed by
Dury, were become common, and were cited by Pleaders, or noticed by
Judges.
It is impossible to evite the clamours of Parties coming short of their expecta∣tion,
when they are in heat and fervency carrying on their Cause, and when
they have heard the Wit and Eloquence of their Advocats, endeavouring to
make their Case, if not evidently just, at least probably such; but when that
fervour is cooled, upon second Thoughts, re-considering the Motives upon
which the Lords proceeded, if they see that they Decided not otherwise upon
the same Grounds, they cannot be so far wanting to their own quiet, as not to
acquiesce and rest satisfied, considering that their first Thoughts were in fer∣vour,
and at best, were but the Conceptions of Parties, whose interest hath a
secret influence to byass their first Apprehensions, they could not but be con∣vinced
that the private and particular opinion of Parties interressed, should
quietly cede to the Judgment of so many learned and experienced Judges, hav∣ing
no other concernment in the event of the Cause, but that Justice might be
inviolable, and that no pernicious or dangerous preparative might be laid, to
the common detriment of all, and who by all the obligations whereof men
are capable, towards God, their Prince, Countrey and Posterity, are engag∣ed
to be careful and tender of Justice.
It is the great interest of Mankind, that every man should not be Judge in
his own Cause, but that there should be indifferent Judges, of good report,
men of courage, fearing God, and hating covetousness, who might hear and de∣termine
the Controversies of Parties, which necessarly doth imply, that either
Party should acquiesce in the publick judgment of Authority.
It is amongst the greatest interests of Mankind, that they may securely enjoy

their Rights and Possessions, being free from fear to be over-reached, or op∣pressed,
without remedy; which can not be attained, unless their Rights be
lodged in the hands of just and judicious Judges, wherein at first they could
have little more to rest on, but the Reputation that their Judges were such,
nor could the Judges then have any other Rule then bonum & equum, accor∣ding
to the discretion of good men, and therefor did differ little from Arbi∣ters,
until they came to have fixed Customs and Statutes, clear and known,
which could not come the length of a sufficient Rule for all Cases, for there
will ever be new Cases occurring; and therefore the best expedient to give
this most desireable Security, is, to show that Judges do alwayes proceed suit∣ably
to themselves without interfeiring; and that they make not Law like the
Delphick Sword, bowing or bending to the several Parties, but as a firm and
stable Rule, which will ply to no obliquity, but whatever must be regulate
by it, must be applyed to it, and be straight like it, and so quadrat one to
another, which can be no way better known, than by the publishing and
comparing of Decisions, whereby it may be seen, that like Cases have like
events, and that there is no respect of persons in Judgment; all men cannot be
Lawers, nor can the most part have discretion enough to understand aequum
& bonum; yet few will be found to want capacity to compare Decisions,
and so perceive if they be congruous and uniform, and if they find them such,
they may easily be perswaded, that their uniformity could be by no other
Rule than Law, and Justice.
It is no small prejudice to any Nation, to make them believe or suspect that
their Rights are not secured in just hands, for that overturns their quiet and
security. The most part will never have a Pursuit determined against them,
and far fewer will find themselves worsted by personal considerations, But
no man can say but he may, and most do fear that they shall be involved in
Law Suits, and if they be not perswaded to find a sure Remedy by just and
knowing Iudges, then all is unsecure and disquieted, so that it is more the
advantage of a Nation that their Judges were but reputed just, though they
were not, then that they were just, yet were reputed unjust, for this Case
toucheth and grieveth all, whereas the former can reach but a few.
King Iames the fifth, who Institute the Colledge of Justice, Ordered one of
the Lords to keep a Journal of their Decisions, with which Henry Sinclar Dean

of Rastalrig was entrusted, and did observe the same for the space of ten years, as
Maitland, Hadingtoun, Hope, Balfour, Spotswood, Dury, and several others since
have done; And after Our Sacred Soveraign who now Reigns, did Restore
the Colledge of Justice to it's ancient Constitution and Splendor, and did
make a full Nomination of the Senators thereof; and Call most of the
Eminent Advocats to the Bench, so that after a long interruption, the Session
was almost wholly new, therefor it was very necessary that their Decisions
should be Observed, which induced me (being one of that Nomination) to
undertake that Task, which I did constantly follow, making up this Journal
of all the Decisions that had any thing of difficulty or importance in them,
which I did design to leave behind me, as a Token of my most devoted af∣fection
to that excellent Society, The Colledge of Iustice, in which, with much
satisfaction I spent the far greatest part of my Life, and was very happy in
the mutual affection of my Colligues, both while I was at the Bar, and on
the Bench, yet the weight of the Charge I did bear, (which in a few years
sunk my Predecessor Sir Iohn Gilmour, though a man of great strength of Bo∣dy
and Spirit, when he undertook that Office) made me consider, that it was fit
for me, before Age or Infirmity should make that burden more uneasie, to have
some remnant of my Life, of which I might be Master, without Diversion, for
which some of your Lordships and others knew my Resolution to retire long
agoe; and therefore I did propose to your Lordships the publishing of these
Decisions wherein I have your allowance and approbation.
I shall need to say nothing as to these Decisions in behalf of your Lord∣ships,
I hope the Matter will speak more for your Honour, than to need any
thing further from me; I might say great things of that Judicature, and of
your selves particularly, but I shall forbear, least any should think it might
look like flattery, and therefore shall only add a little for my self.
I did not pick out such Decisions as I liked best, leaving out others which
might have showen contrariety; nor did I express my opinion when diffe∣rent
from the plurality, but I had ever that Deference to your Judgement,
that I did not omit any thing that was said for it, much less did I magnifie my
own opinion against it, though I cannot say that I did oft differ from it.
I did form this Breviat of these Decisions, in fresh and recent Memory, de
die in diem as they were pronunced; I seldom eat, before I Observed the
Interlocutors I judged of difficulty, that past that day, and when I was hinder∣ed
by any extraordinary occasion, I delayed no longer then that was over. It
was neither feazable nor fit that I should set down the large Pleadings, or the
Written Informations of Parties, I did peruse them throughly, and pitched

upon the Reasons which were of moment, as to the points determined, where∣as
in the same Informations, there were many obvious clear Points insisted on,
which I omitted.
I did alwayes relate the Case as it was proposed or resumed to the Lords,
and with the important Reasons offered by Parties, I added these which oc∣curred
to the Lords in their Deliberations; so that all the Reasons and Mo∣tives
upon which the Lords proceeded, will neither be found in Parties In∣formations,
nor Clerks Minuts, for though it was not fit for the Lords to
suggest any Point of Fact not alleadged by Parties: Yet it was most proper
for them to supply the Points of Law arising from the Fact proposed. And
in such a Breviat it is not to be expected that I should at large set down the
Elegant and Eloquent Disputes of the Lawers, but that I should express the
Matter and Moment of their Reasons, with the greatest plainness and equa∣lity
that I could.
It is like, some of my Colligues may have observed other Cases than these,
and in these, may have worded Interlocutors otherwise, and adduced some
other Reasons, which cannot at all weaken the Credit of these, for some
Decisions were past when I kept my Course in the Outter-House, and others
were Reported long after the Informations were given, which might escape
me, and many I thought of no such intricacy or importance, as made them
fit to be published, but I do with all sincerity and confidence assert, that I
did omit none I found of difficulty, upon any design to cover inconsistencies,
or any other end of that kind, nor is it of import what the words were, if the
Matter were truly exprest; for no Observer did ever look into the Clerks
Minuts, and different Observers will not alwayes have the same Opinion of
the importance of Reasons, nor will find themselves obliged to adduce all the
Reasons proposed: Neither have I Recorded any Decisions but what was
determined while I was present, being resolved to take nothing at a second
hand.
These Decisions were Written with many different hands, but all of them
were then in my Family, and some of them understood not the Matter, by
which, and the haste I was forced oftimes to put them to, there was much un∣correct,
but I did expect that I might have been present, and have overseen the
Press my self; I began to cause Transcribe them with a better hand, and did
consider whether it were not fit to amplifie and embellish the Disputes so, as
might have been expected from so pregnant and eloquent Pleaders, as our
time hath afforded, who have been nothing short of their Predecessors, but
I thought that this would look too like a new Frame from my own Fancy or
Memory, after so long a time, and therefore I resolved they should be keept

as they were at first Written, and if so they prove uniform, as it will be a
great evidence of your Lordships Justice, so it will be a strong proof that
they are sincere and authentick, having been Written on the several Sede∣runt
dayes, for more then twenty years together; and therefore I do inteat
the favour, that what is uncorrect may be excused and supplied from the Mat∣ter.
I had the best opportunity to make these Observations, being scarce a day
absent in any of these Sessions wherein I have marked them from the first of Iune
1661. until the first of August 1681. And I was not one day absent from the
thirteenth of Ianary 1671. when it pleased His Majesty to appoint me to
be constant President of the Session in place of my Lord Craigmiller, who
had then demitted, except the Summer Session 1679. when I attended His
Majesty by His own Command, during all which time, I hope your Lord∣ships
will bear me Witness that I never used Arrogance or Insolence, or the
least reproachful or bitter expression against any of the number; and I do
with great thankfulness acknowledge that I could not have expected more
kindness and respect than I found from your Lordships, which made me in
gratitude take this Opportunity to testifie the Honour and Value I have
for that honourable Society, and that I am in great sincerity,

My Lords,
