My Lord!
THE Sacred Pages inform us of a Son that was Nourished up in the Words of Faith, by his Grand∣mother Lois, and his Mother Eunice.
The like Pious Care has been taken for Your Lordship's Religious Education, by one of the Wisest of Women, and the Best of Mothers that the Age has afforded: And that Your Lordship's Improvement in Knowledge and Sincere Piety, may Answer the Prayers, the Tears, the Endeavours of such an Endearing Parent, who preferrs Your Lordship's Happiness abundantly before her Own; I take Leave to put a Part of the Inspired Writings into Your Lordship's Hand, with an Endeavour of Mine, to Render the Reading of them both Profitable and Delightful to Your Lordship.

Whilst Others consume their Precious Hours in Plays and Romances, and such-like Corrupting and Effeminating Trash, which the Superfoetation of the Stage furnishes the Nation with, to the Scandal of Our Holy Religion, and the Grief of all Good Men; Debasing the Minds, and Debauching the Manners of so many amongst us: That Your Lordship (and Others of Your Noble Order with you) may Taste such Incomparable Delight and Sweetness in, and Experience such Invaluable Benefit and Advantage by, Reading the History of Your Blessed Redeemer's Life and Actions; and may thereby be Transformed into His Holy Likeness here on Earth, and spend an Eternity in the Rapturous Contem∣plation, and Ravishing Fruition of Him in Heaven, is the Fervent Prayer of,
My Lord,
