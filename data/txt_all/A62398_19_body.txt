I Humbly now according to my Dream,
Present to you the young Laird of Erckleton,
From's Goodsir and Grandsir that Land was reft and riven,
Before they purchas'd Coyn to buy it back again,
And now 'tis their own, I wish they may't enjoy,
From Envys canker, better than Helen did Troy;
That Trojan and that Greek that fought in Sama sand,
Achilles gain'd the day, and did Hector command;
Troys fruitful Queen did many Children bear,
So brave, heroick, and so stout a Crew,
Who all in noble Actions did accrue,
When Age had made their Parents bald and bare,
They made their dauntless Courage to appear,
Amidst the throngs of Danger and Debate,
But Blood on Blood their Fury could not fate:
In former times the South may understand,

Many Gallants losed all their Land,
Through Blood and want of Government,
Which to this time Successors may repent;
They were not like these Arcadians in Greece,
That rejoyc'd in Iasons Golden Fleece.
