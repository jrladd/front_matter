WHen these CHARACTERS curt, and short ESSAYES,
Right Worshipfull, vnworthie of Your view,
At some successiue Hours, on ydle dayes,
My Pen, for Pinsell; Coale, for Co∣lours, drew,
I stood, and studi'd, whose praeponed Name▪
Should dye in Graine, and Luster lend to Them▪


My Wits conven'd, and in my Braine combynd,
The free and friendlie Favours that I fand,
With th'ever-courteous Countenance and kynd,
That I haue alwayes at Your Honours Hand;
Advise mee onlie, that Your Worship shall
Giue Luster, Life, Dye, and adorne Them all.



Deigne then t'accept Them with that wonted Grace,
Smoothe Front, and Face, that I did ever find:
Which perfectlie doth point out, and expresse
The Gen'rose Sprite, the wise and worthie Mind,
Which doth before the Worke, and Work-mans Skill,
In given-Gifts, regard the Givers Will.
