WE finde it by common experience (right Honorable and Worshipfull) and the effectes are too much seene and proued amongst vs, that as there are many dangerous diseases, which happen to a mans body, wherof some are so hurtfull to the same, and worke by such outragi∣ous meanes; as they not onely threaten great hazard of death to the body, but at length (after many calme showers) doo vtterly waste and depriue it of lyfe. So in a kingdome or common wealth, which maye by A comparison betweene a mans body and a com∣mon wealth. comparison very well be resembled to a mans body, there often chaunceth very sore and doubtfull sick∣nesses, which growe in tyme to such forcible and ex∣treame occasions: as they not onely daunger the pe∣rishing of the most part, but in conclusion worke the vtter ruine and destruction of the whole. Yet when the body is offended by sicknesse, the freendes of the diseased party do dilligently enquire after Phisitions:

then what medicines his Arte can deuise, or what wholsome potions good councell can minister, are presently prepared for ease of his vexation.
In like manner, in any common wealth, that is thus touched with any disease that foresheweth peryll: All men are bound in duetie to defend their Countrie. euery one that is faithfully affected to the same, or imploy theyr liues (as they ought) for the benefite thereof, are bound with heedfull care to seeke reme∣dy for such malladies, yea, it is a principall article of theyr duety, to let slip no occasion that may be iud∣ged helpfull in such a case. For if freendshippe cause men for theyr priuate familiars sake, to trauayle in knowledge of the cause of his infirmity, and then to prouide such apt necessaries, as may yeelde hope to qualifie his agony, and restore him to his former health: much more ought duety to be effectuall in such men, as make estimation of theyr Country and common wealth, at what tyme any troublesome an∣noyaunce dooth mollest it, or any daunger whatsoe∣uer may be thought towards it: to shew themselues earnest and forward in search of the greefe, and then to apply such due and necessary medicines, as may expell the very thought of threatned daunger.
The excellent Historiographer Herodotus sheweth Herodotus in his Booke called Clio, which is the first Booke of his Story. vs a notable example, how the Babilonians made this lawe amongst them, that when so euer any man fell sicke within their dominions, he should presently be brought into the market place, & there be laid on his bed: to the intent that he might demaūd of euery one that came to him, whether they had beene troubled with the lyke disease or no, and by what means they recouered theyr health, that he might by knowledge

thereofattayne to the same. And by the same lawe lykewise, euery man that came to him was bound, both to aske the man what sicknesse he had: and al∣so to shew him (if it lay in him to doo it) what might soonest delyuer him from that state. By which ex∣ample, euery one that beareth a true & faithful zeale to his Countrie, and earnestly tendereth the health and wealth thereof: when so euer he seeth the body thereof (which lyeth open before all mens eyes) to be infected or touched with any infirmitie, and can eyther by experience or otherwise delyuer, what in his conceit may be imagined auayleable: he is boūd in conscience to expresse it, and great is the penaltie if he conceale it. For in helping the whole body, he hath benefite therof himselfe, in that he is a member The whole hody being out of qui∣et, the members must needes fare the wurse. thereof: for let the body be sicke, the members must needes be partakers of the greefe, and at what tyme it findeth health againe, the members lykewise haue comfort by the releefe. The consideration of these precedentes (right Honourable and Worshipfull) with the earnest care, zeale and loue I beare to my Countrie, which I see (for the happy and flourishing estate therof, and for the maintenaunce of Gods true Religion, and defence of his Church and congregati∣on) wanteth no enimies to pursue the daunger of it, nor coullorable freendes that seeke to betraye it to spoyle, which could they as easilie accomplishe, as they willinglie put in practise, and had not GOD more care of his chosen, then their malicious sto∣mackes can affoord: God knowes the heauie burden should lye on our necks, which I pray God they ne∣uer liue to lay on, nor we o feele.

But as the marke is easilie seene, which they so mightilie and continuallie ayme at, and for that The marke that these Traytours ayme at, may be easily discerned. God (praysed be his name therefore) hath hytherto preuented all their trayterous attempts, turning their daggers into their owne bosomes, and causing them to fall into the pitte they made for others: so is it expedient for vs to continue in prayer, that it may please him long to vouchsafe that prouidēt care ouer vs, and that we lykewise applie our owne duetifull wisdome and pollicie, to vphold that plant by whose meanes we prosper, and preuent their deuises, who would robbe vs of so high a treasure.
It is our dread and soueraigne Lady, whose shy∣ning vertues fret the polluted eyes of these vnnatu∣rall Subiectes: whose heroicall gouernement (which no Realme in the world is able to match for peace∣able continuaunce) that sticketh lyke sharpe needles in their venoumed and disdainefull stomackes; and it is the rare president of her famous lyfe, her Chri∣stian zeale, and aboundaunce of all excellent giftes, which woorthelie winneth the heartes of her true Subiectes, and inflameth them with desire of her long prosperitie, that calling their barbarous conceite into question, thundreth such Maiestie into their de∣ceyued eares, as they pollishe theyr tongues to de∣praue, spare no penne-worke to slaunder, whette their weapons, and deuise all tretcheries that lost and forsaken mindes can doo, to extinguishe the lyght of that Sunne, whereon their seared-consciences wyll not suffer them to looke, and to deface that perfect Emeralde, which the more they seeke to blemishe with the oyle of venemous reportes, the more per∣fect

it sheweth it selfe in beautie.
I neede not report vnto you, for that your wise∣domes The prosperity of the Prince, is the safety of her Kingdome. and iudgementes are verie well acquainted therewith, that the prosperitie of the Prince, is the assured safetie of the whole Kingdome and common wealth, and the least motion of greefe that toucheth her, concerneth the whole state ingenerall; by rea∣son that her Highnesse is the most louing Mother and Nurse of all her good Subiectes, and is lykewise the husband of the common weale, maried to the Realme, and the same by ceremony of Ring as so∣lemnly signified, as any other mariage.
Can we then that are her Maiesties chyldren, her true and faithfull subiectes endure to see our mother wronged, her authoritie defamed, her lyfe endaunge∣red: and shall we not thinke the same concerneth vs? Can we see proud reprobates seeke to seuer the knot of loue and agreement, which hath beene iustly and lawfully vnited betweene her and vs, to yeelde our liues in slauerie and seruitude to an vsurping tyrant: and shall not the breach of this bonde of sacred wed∣locke, mooue vs to regard how highly it harmeth vs? Nature causeth the chylde to worke all policies he may for his Mothers defence, and the estimation of that holy league of loue, is of force to compell the faithfull, to maintaine and continue it.
The case then touching vs so neerelie as it dooth, The eare of the Princes safetie concerneth the verie meanest Subiect, much more the Magi∣strate, to whome she hath giuen office of honour. the verie meanest subiect is bound for his Princes defence, much more they whome God hath called to office of Magistracie and bearing rule: their care ought to be both night and daye, how to set downe

good lawes and orders, to be vigilant and carefull in dilligent search and enquirie, to bring such stubborne and gracelesse men to open lyght, who spurne at her Maiestie, that hath put the Sworde in your handes of honour and authoritie, and trying theyr deedes to be contrarie to the duetie of good Sub∣iectes, to let them be soone cutte off by the sword of Iustice.
And if I maye (without offence) speake one word to your Honour and VVorshippes, not by waye of teaching, but for vnlading some part of the burden of true loue I beare to my Countrie: I would de∣sire you to haue an especiall eye to the Cittie of Lon∣don, for it is a receptacle to many of these bad people, and many fauourers & freends they haue in the Cit∣tie, who bearing the countenaunce of good and ho∣nest Subiectes, are neuerthelesse but hollowe hearted, and giue aide and releefe to such as seeke the ruine of the whole state.
Your Honour and VVorships shall notablie wit∣nesse the loue you beare to God and his Church, and the zeale, affection and duetie you owe to her Maie∣stie: in being respectiue to this especiall cause, for it is high tyme, the enimies are nowe growne so bolde and full of mischeefe, as if such as are in authority doo not laye too theyr helping handes to represse them, they will in tyme beso wylde, as they will be past bridleling.
This shall be therefore my last request vnto you, that the premisses considered, the effect may be put in execution: and when you haue perused this smal

worke, I doubt not but you will thinke my request honest and lawfull, and expedient to be redressed to the vttermost of your powers. Thus wishing prosperous successe to all you goe about, that may set foorth Gods glory, and be to her Maiesties defence from her eni∣mies: I humbly take my leaue.
