ACute & amiable Dick,
not Dic mihi Musa
virum, Musing Dick,
that studied a whole
yeare to know which
was the male and fe∣male
of red herrings:
nor Dic obsecro,
Dick of all Dickes,
that in a Church where the Organs were defac'd,
came and offred himselfe with his pipe and taber:
nor old Dick of the Castle, that vpon the newes

of the losse of Calis, went and put a whole
bird-spit in the pike of his buckler: nor Dick
Swash or Desperate Dick, that's such a terri∣ble
Cutter at a chyne of beefe, and deuoures
more meate at Ordinaries in discoursing of his
fraies and deep acting of his slshing and hew∣ing,
than would serue halfe a dozen Brewers
Dray-men: nor Dick of the Cow, that mad
Demilance Northren Borderer, who plaid his
prizes with the Lord Iockey so brauely: but
paraphrasticall gallant Patron Dick, as good a
fellow as euer was Heigh fill the pot hostesse:
curteous Dicke, comicall Dicke, liuely Dicke,
louely Dicke, learned Dicke, olde Dicke of
Licfield, Iubeo te plurimum saluere, which is
by interpretation, I ioy to heare thou hast so
profited in gibridge.
I am sure thou wondrest not a little, what
I meane to come vppon thee so straungelye,
with such a huge dicker of Dickes in a heape
altogether: but that's but to shew the redun∣dance
of thy honorable Familie, and how af∣fluent
and copious thy name is in all places,
though Erasmus in his Copia verborum neuer
mentions it.
Without further circumstance to make short,
(which to speake troth is onely proper to thy Trade)

the short and long of it is this, There is
a certaine kinde of Doctor of late very pittifully
growen bald, and thereupon is to be shauen im∣mediately,
to trie if that will helpe him: now
I know no such nimble fellow at his weapon in
all England as thy selfe, who (as I heare) standst
in election at this instant to bee chiefe Crowner
or clipper of crownes in Cambridge, and yet no
defacer of the Queenes coyne neither: and it is
pittie but thou shouldst haue it, for thou hast
long seru'd as a Clarke in the crowne office, and
concluded syllogismes in Barbara anie time this
sixteene yeare, and yet neuer metst with anie re∣quitall,
except it were some few french crownes,
pild Friers crownes, drye shauen, not so much
worth as one of these Scottish horne crownes:
which (thy verie enemies must needes confesse)
were but bare wages, (yea as bare as my nayle I
faith) for thy braue desert and dexteritie: &
some such Thinne gratuitie or Haire-loome
it may be the Doctor may present thee with,
but how euer it falls, hath his head or his
hayre the falling sicknesse neuer so, without a∣nie
more delay, Of or on, trimm'd hee must
bee with a trice, and there is no remedie but
thou must needes come and ioyne with me to
giue him the terrible cut.
Wherefore (good Dick) on with thy apron, &
arme thy selfe to set him downe at the first word:
Stand to him I say, and take him a button lower,
feare not to shew him aBarbers knacking their fingers. nacke of thy occupa∣tion,
and once in thy life let it be said, that a Doc∣tor
weares thyTheyr lousy naprie they put about mēs neckes, whiles they are trīming. cloth, or that thou hast caud
him to doo pennance, and weare Haire-cloth for
his sinnes. Were he as he hath been (I can assure
thee) he would clothe and adorne thee with ma∣nie
gracious gallant complements, and not a rot∣ten
tooth that hangs out at thy shop window,
but should cost him an indefinite Turkish armie
of English Hexameters. O, he hath been olde
dogge at that drunkn staggering kinde of verse,
which is all vp hill and downe hill, like the way
betwixt Stamford and Beecfeeld, and goes like
a horse plunging through the myre in the deep of
winter, now soust vp to the saddle, and straight
aloft on his tiptoes. Indeed, in old King Harrie
sinceritie, a kinde of verse it is, hee hath been n∣foft
in from his minoritie, for as I haue bin faith∣fully
informed hee first cryde in that verse in the
verie moment of his birth, and when he was but
yet a fresh-man in Cambridge, he set vpSiquis a bill for any thīg lst. Siquis∣ses,
& sent his accounts to his father in those iul∣ting
Heroicks. Come, come, account of him as
you list, by Poll and Adipoll I protest, your

noble Science ofFor diuisiō & contraction. decision and contraction is im∣mortally
beholding to him, for twice double his
Patrimonie hath he spent in carefull cherishing &
preseruing his pickerdeuant: and besides a deuine
icarly brother of his, called Astrologicall Ri∣chard,
some few yeares since (for the benefit of his
countrey) most studiously compyled a profound
Abridgement vpon bards, & therein copiously
dilated of the true discipline of peakes, & no lesse
frutelessely determined, betwixt the Swallowes
taile cut, & the round beard like a rubbing brush.
It was my chaunce (O thrice blessed chaunce) to
the great comfort of my Muse to peruse it, al∣though
it came but priuately in Print: and for a
more ratefied pasport (in thy opinion) that I haue
read it and digested it, this title it beareth, aTherfore belike hee gaue it that title, because it was most of it short aire his father made ropes of. De∣fence
of short haire against Synesius and Pieri∣us:
or rather in more familiar English to expresse
t, a Dash ouer the head against baldnes, verie ne∣cessary
to be obserued of al the looser sort, or loose
haird sort of yong Gentlemen & Courtiers, and
no lesse pleasant and profitable to be remembred
of the whole Common-wealth of the Barbars.
The Pose theretoo annexed,  est breui∣tate
sua, as much to say, as Burne Bees and haue
Bees, & hair the more it is cut the more it comes:
lately deuised and set forth by Richard Haruey,

the vnluckie Prophet of prodigies. If this may
not settle thy beleefe, but yet thou requirest a fur∣ther
token to make vp euen money, in the Epi∣stle
Dedicatorie thereof to a great Man of this
Land, whom he calls his verie right honourable
good Lord, he recounteth his large bounties be∣stowed
vppon him, `and talkes of the secret fa∣uours
which hee did him in his Studie or Closet
at Court.
Heare you Dick, marke you here what a iewell
this learning is: how long wil it be, ere thou stu∣die
thy selfe to the like preserment. No reason I
see, why thou being a Barber shouldst not bee as
hair-braind as he. Onely for writing a booke of
beards, in which he had no further experience, but
by looking on his father when he made hairs, hair
lines I meane, and yet not such lines of life as a
hangman hath in his hand, but haire lines to hang
linnen on: for that smal demerit (I say) is he thus
aduanced and courted, & from Astrological Dick
raised to bee fauorite Dick. And verie meete it is
he should be so fauored and raisd by high Persona∣ges,
for before he was as low a Parson or Vicar, as
a man could lightly set ey on.
With teares be it spoken, too few such lowly
Parsons & Preachers we haue, who laying aside all
worldly encumbrances, & plesant cōuersing with

Saint Austen, Ierome, Chrisostome, wilbe con∣tnt
to read a Lecture as he ath done de lana ca∣prina,
(almost as slender a cast subiect as a Catts
smelling haires,) or trauerse the subtile distincti∣ons
twixt short cut and lng taile.
Fie, this is not the ortieth dandiprat part of
the affectionate Items, ee hath bequeathed on
your mysterie, with fiue housand other doctrinal
deuotions, hath he adopted himselfe more than a
by founder of your trade, conioyning with his a∣foresaid
Doctor Brother in eightie eight browne
Bakers dozen of Almancks.
In euerie of which faous Annals of the oure
windes, vnfallible rules are prescribd for men to
obserue the best time to breed loue-lockes in, and
so toSoe holde, that any place of a mans chin, eeing rubd with a gold rīg beeing heated, will so harden the skin, that tere shall neuer anie haire grow there more. ringle a thorugh hayre for rooting, that
it shall neuer put foorth his snyles hornes again:
as also vnder what Planet a man mae with least
danger picke his teeh, and  to catch the Sun
in such a phisicall Signe, that one may sweat and
be not a haire the worse.
But these amlifications adiourned to ano∣ther
Returne, all the deuoyre Diamond Dick,
which I am in this Epistle of thy daintie com∣position
to expostulate, is no more but this,
that since vnder ty-redoubted patronage and

protection my workes are to haue their royall
Bestellein, the royallest Passe in Germanie that may bee, onely for Dukes & great princes. Bestellein and more than common safe conduct
into the world, and that for the Meridian of thy
honour and magnificence they are chiefely eleua∣ted
& erected, tho wouldst brauely mount thee
on thy barbed steed, alias thy triumphant barbers
Chaire, and girding thy keene Paermo rasour o
thy side, in stead of a trechant Turkish semito∣rie,
and setting thy sharpe pointedA lāce an instrumēt to let bloud with. launce in his
rest, be with them at a haires bredth that backbite
and detract me.
Phlebothomize them, sting them, tutch them
Dick, tutch them, play the valiant man at Armes
and let them bloud and spare not; the Lawe al∣lowes
thee to do it, it will beare no action: and
thou beeing a Barber Surgeon, art priuiledgd to
dresse flesh in Lent, or anie hing.
Adit this be not suffcient to coole the hea of
their courage, serch them in aother vaine, by dis∣charging
thy pocket dag against them, and let
them smart for it to the proofe.
Stele thy painted May po▪ or more proper∣ly
to tearme it, thy redoubted rigorous horsmans
staffe (which at thy dore as a manifest signe thou
hangst forth of thy martiall powesse and hardi∣ment)
on their insolent creasts, that maligne and
despise me, and forbeare not to bring forth all thy

brasse peces against them. It is well knon
thou hast been a Commaunder and a 
walkt the round, ad dealt verie short and round
with all those tha cme vnder thy fngers: rug∣led
through the  deepe, and skirmisht on
the downes: wherefore if thou ta'st them not
downe soundlie, with a hey downe and a drry,
and doost not suffle and cut with them usti∣lie,
actum est de pudicitia, I aske of God thou
maist light vpon none but bald-pates till thou di∣est.
But I trow thou wilt carry a better pate with
thee, and not suffer any of these indigent old fa∣shiond
iudgements to carry it away: whose wits
were right stuffe when those loue-letters in rime
were in request & whose capacities nur mend∣ed
their pace, since Pace the Duke of Norfolkes
foole died. As for the decaied Proctor of Saffron∣walden
himself, if he wander within the 
of thy indignation, I make no question but of thy
owne accord without any motion of mine, thou
wilt be as ready as any catchpoule, out of all scotch
& notch to torment him, & deal as snip snap snap∣pishly
with him, as euer he was delt withall since
he first dated letters from his gallerie in Trinitie
Hall, not suffring a lowse that belongs to him to
passe thy hands without a powling penny, and yet

as I shrewdly presage, thou shalt not finde many
powling pence about him neither, except he rob
Peter to pay Pole, empouerish is spiritual Vi∣car
brother to helpe to pay for his powling, and
he alas, (dolefull foure nobles Curate, nothing so
good as the Confeslor of Tyburne, or Superin∣tendent
of Pancredge) hath nittiide himselfe
with a dish rotundè profundè ny time this four∣teene
yeare, to saue charges of seep-shearing: &
not to make of a thing more than it is, hath scarce
so much Ecclesiasticall liuing in all, as will serue to
buy him cruell strings to his booke▪ and haire
buttons.
Wherefore I passe not if in tender chaitie and
commiseration of his estate, I adde ten pound &
a purse to his wages and stipend, canuaze hi and
his Angell brother Gabriell in ten sheetes of pa∣per,
and so leaue them to goe hang themselue▪ or
outright to hang draw and quarter them al vnder
one, I care not if I make it eighteen: on that con∣dition
in their last wil & restament they bequeath
me eighteene wise words in the way of answere
betwixt them.
I dare gine my word for them, they will neuer
doe it, no not although it were inioynd to them
in stead of their neck-verse: their whole stock of
wit when it was at the best, beeing but ten Eng∣lish

Hexameter  and a Lenuoy: whereoe g∣nerous
Dick (without hum drum be it spoken) I
vtterly despaie of them, or not so much despaire
of them, as count them a paire of poore ideots,
bing not only but also two brothers, two block∣heads,
two blunderkins, hauing their braines stut
with ought but balder-dash, but that they are
the verie botts & the glanders to the gentle Rea∣ders,
the dead Palsie and Apoplexie of the Presse,
he Sarpego and the Sciatica of the 7. Liberall
Sciences, the surfetting vomit of Ladie Vanitie,
the sworne bauds to one anothers vain-glorie: &
to conclude, the most contemptible Mounsier
Aiaxes of excrementall conceipts, and stinking
kenel-rakt vp inuention, that this or anie Age
euer afforded.
I pry thee surmounting Donel Dick, whiles
I am in this heate of Inuectiue, let me remember
thee to do this one kindnes more for me, videli∣cet,
when thou hast frizled and scrubd and tickled
the haires sweetly, and that thou hast filcht thy
selfe into an excellent honourable assembly of
sharpe iudiciall fierie wits and fine spirites, bee it
this winter at an Euening tearme, or where-euer,
with all the thundring grace and magnanimous
eloquence that thou hast, put vp this heroycall
Grace in their behalfe, if thou bee not past grace.






MOst humblie sueth to your Reuerences, the reprobate
brace of Brothers of the Harueys:  wit, witlesse
Gabriell and ruffling Richard; That whereas for anie
time this foure and twentie yeare they haue plaid the
fantasticall gub-shites and goose-giblets in Print, and
kept a hatefull scribling and a pamphleting about earth∣quakes,
coniunctions, inundations, the fearfull blazing
Starre, and the forsorne Flaxe-wife: and tooke vpon
them to be false Prophets, VVeather-wizards, Fortune∣tellers,
Poets, Philosophers, Orators, Historiographers,
Mountebankes, Ballet makers, and left no Arte vndefa∣med
with their filthie dull-headed practise: it may please
your VVorships and Masterships, these infidell premisses
considered, & that they haue so fully performed all their
acts in absurditie, impudence, & foolerie, to grant them
their absolute Graces, to commence at Dawes crosse, and
with your general subscriptions confirm them for the pro∣foundest
Arcandums, Acarnanians, and Dizards, that
haue been discouered since the Deluge: & so let them passe
throughout the Queenes Dominions.



Purposely that space I left, that as manie as I
shall perswade they are Pachees, Poldauisses,
and Dringles, may set their hands to their de∣finitiue
sentence, and with the Clearke helpe
to crye Amen, to their ternall vnandsom∣ming.
Plie them, plie them vncessantly vico Dick,
euen as a Water-man plies for his Fares, and insi∣nuate
and goe about the bush with them, like as
thou art wont to insinuate and go about the griz∣lie
bushie beard of some sauage Saracen Butcher,
and neuer surceae flaunting and sirking it in fusti∣an,
till vnder the Vniuersities vnited hand & seale
they bee enacted as Obsolaete a case of Cockes∣combes,
as euer he was in Trinitie Colledge, that
would not carrie his Tutors bow into the field,
because it would not edifie: or his fellow qui quae
codshead, that in the Latin Tragedie of K. Ri∣chard,
cride Ad rbs, ad vrbs, ad vrbs, when
his whole Part was no more, but Vrbs, vrbs, ad
arma, ad arma.
Shall I make a motion, which I would not
haue thee thinke I induce to flatter thee ney∣ther,
thou being not in my walke, whereby I
might come to wash my handes with thee a
mornings, or get a sprinkling or a brushing
for a brybe: wilt thou commence, and make

no more ado, since▪ thou hast almost as much lear∣ning
and farre more wit, than the two Brothers,
or eyther of those profound qui mihi Discipu∣lasses
aboue mentioned.
Now merely (I perswade mee) if thou wouldst
attempt it, not all the Gabriels betwixt this and
Godmanchester put together, wold make a more
perpolite cathedral Doctor than thy selfe: for all
languages at thy fingers ende thou hast as perfect
as Spruce, and nere a Dicke Haruey or cathe∣drall
Doctor of them all, can read a more smooth
succinct Lipsian Lecture of short haire, than
thou ouer thy Barbars Chaire, if thou bee so dis∣posed,
nor stand and encounter all commers so
constantly.
Dick, I exhort thee as a brother, be not a horse
to forget thy own worth, thou art in place where
thou maist promote thy selfe, do not close-prison
and eclipse thy vertues in the narrow glasse lant∣horne
of thy Barbers shop, but reflect them vp
and downe the Realme, like to those prospectiue
glasses which expresse not the similitudes they re∣ceiue
neere hand, but cast them in the ayre a farre
off, where they are more clerely represented.
Commence, commence I admonish thee, thy
merits are ripe for it, & there haue been Doctors
of thy Facultie, as Doctor Dodipowle for exam∣ple:

and here in London yet extant viu voc to
testifi Doctor Nott and Doctor Powle, none
of which in notting and powling go beyond thee▪
To vtter vnto thee my fancie as touching those
Neoterick tongues thou professest, in whose pro∣nunciation
old Tooly and thou varie as much, as
Stephen Gardineer and Sir Iohn Cheek about
the pronunciation of the Greeke tongue: loe,
for a testifying incouragement how much  wish
thy ncrease in those languages, I haue hr took
th paines to nit and louze ouer the Doctours
Booke, and though mni cholricke Cookes a∣bout
London in a mad rage haue dismembred it,
and thrust it piping hot into the oun vnder the
bottomes of dosts, and impiously prickt the
torne sheetes of it for basting paper, on the out∣sides
of Geese and rosting Beefe, to keepe them
from burning▪ yet haue I naturally cherisht it
and hugd it in my boome, euen as a Carrir
of Bosomes Inne dooth a Cheese vnder his
arme, and the purest Parmsn magget Phra∣ses
therein, ll'd and pickt out to preent
thee with.
Read and pruse them ouer as diigntly s
thou wouldst doo a chare against the tooth∣ache:
for this I can gospelly uouch, o sleight
paynes hath the Doctour tooke in collctg

them, consulting a whole quarter of a yeare with
Textors Epithites (which he borrowd of a frend
of mine in Poules Churchyard) onely to pounse
them out more poetically.
Be not self-wild, but insist in my precepts, and
I will tutour thee so Pythagoreanly how to hus∣band
them in al companies, that euen VVilling∣ton
himselfe thy fellow Barber in Cambridge,
(who hath long borne the bell for finicall descan∣ting
on the Crates) shalbe constrained to wor∣ship
and offer to thee.
Abruptly to breake into the bowels of this In∣dex
of bald inkhornisme, what saist thou for all
thou art reputed such anA rag borrowd from his wne . aenigmaticall linguist,
(vnder the Doctors terme probatorie license bee
it spoken, being a terme with him as frequent as
standing vpon termes among lawiers) canst thou
enter into the true nature of villanie by conni∣ence?
I hold a groate thou canst not conster it.
A word it is, that the Doctor lay a whole weeke
nd a day & a night entraed on his bed to bring
forth, and on the Munday euening late, causd all
the bels in the Parish where he then soiournd, to
be rong forth, for ioy that he was deliuerd of it.
Repent, and be ashamed of thy rudenesse: O
thou that hast made so manie men winke whyles
thou cast suds in their eyes, and yet knowest not

what Conniuence meanes. Plodding and dunsti∣cally
like a clowne of Cherry-hinton basely thou
beseechest them to winke, whiles thou mak'st a
Tennis-court of their faces, by brick-walling thy
clay-balls crosse vp and downe their cheekes:
whereas if thou wert right orthographizd in the
Doctors elocution, thou wouldst say in stead of
I pray Sir winke I must wash you, Sir, by your fa∣uour
I must require your conniuence.
Againe, it is thy custome being sent for to some
tall old sinckanter, or stigmaticall bearded Master
of Arte, that hath been chin-bound euer since
Charles the ninths massacre in France, to rush in
bluntly with thy washing bowle and thy nurse∣cloutes
vnder thy cloake, and after a few scraping
ceremonies, to aske if his Worship bee at leasure
to be recreated.
A malo in peius, that is the meanest salutati∣on
that ere I heard: vtterly thou bewrayest thy
non-proficiencie in the Doctors Paracelsian rop∣rethorique.
What a pestilence, a yong braine and
so poore and penurious in Conges? Rayse thy
conceipt on the trees, or rather than faile new
corke it at the heeles, before it should thus walke
bare-foote vp and downe the streetes.
Hence take thy Harueticall exordum, if thou
wouldst haue thy conceit the worlds fauourite at

first dash Omniscious and omnisufficient Master
Doctor, (for so hee calls Cornelius Agrippa)
will it please you to bee cosmologizd and smirkt.
Suppose a Bishop come to the Vniuersitie, as
the Bishop of Lincolne somtimes to visit Kings
Colledge, and the Bishop of Ely Saint Iohns,
(whiles there was euer a Bishop there) a playne
Bishop (like Marti) at euerie word thou wilt
terme him, whereas if thou wert but one hower
entred commons in Haruey de ratore, A
great, Potife or Demy-god in omnisufficiencie
thou wouldst enstall him.
But to appose thee more dallyingly and famili∣arly.
It is giuen out amongst Schollers, that thou
hast a passing singular good wit, now so trie whi∣ther
thou hast so or no, let me heare what change
of phraes thou hast to describe a good wit in, or
how in Pdagogue Tragotanto Doctors english
thou canst florish vpon it.
I feele thy pusses beat slowly alreadie, although
thou beest fortie mile off from mee, and this im∣potent
answere (with much adoo) droppes from
thee, euen as sweate from a leane man that drinks
lacke; namely, that thou thinkest there cannot
much extraordinarie descant be made of it, except
it be to say, such a one hath an admirable capacitie,
an incomparable quick inneution, and a surmoun∣ting

rich spirit aboue all men. Hah, ha, a de∣stitute
poore fellow art thou, and hast mist mee
nine score: goe, goe, get thee a caudle and keepe
thy selfe warme in thy bed, for out of question thy
spirit is in a consumption.
A rich spirit quoth a? nay then a spirit in the
way of honestie too: loe this it is, to bee read in
nothing but in Barnabe Riches workes. Spend
but a quarter so much time in mumping vppon
Gabrtelisme, and Ile be bound bodie and goods,
thou wilt not anie longer sneakingly come forth
with a rich spirit and an admirable capacitie, but
an entbusiasticall spirit, & a nimble entelechy. In
the course of my Booke a whole catalogue thou
shalt finde of all these Guiny phrases, to which in
zealous care of thy reformation, I referre thee.
Dii boni boni, quid porto? What a large Di∣ocesse
of Epistling haue I here progrest through?
The Summons to a generall Councell with all
the reasons moouing thereunto, or Tindalls Pro∣logue
before the New Testament, are but short
Graces before meate, in comparison of this my
immoderate Dedication. But the best is, if it be
too long, thou hast a combe and a paire of scissers
to curtall it; or if thou list not stand so long a∣bout
it, with a Trinitie Colledge rubbr thou
maist epitomize it extempore.
Marrie if thou long to heare the reason why I
haue so stretcht it on the tenter-hookes, forsooth
it is a garment for the woodcocke Gabriel Har∣ucy,
and fooles ye know alwaies for the most part
(especiallie if they bee naturall fooles) are suted in
long coates, whereupon I set vp my rest to shape
his garments of the same size, that I might be sure
to sit on his skirts.
Dick, no more at this time, but Nos-da diu ca∣tawhy,
and all the recompence I can make thee for
being like a Chancery Declaration so tiring trou∣blesome
vnto thee, is this, if thou wilt haue the
Doctour for an Anatomie, thou shalt; doo but
speake the word, and I am the man will deliuer
him to thee to be scotcht and carbonadod: but
in anie case speake quickly, for heere he lies at the
last gaspe of surrendring all his credit and reputa∣tion.
