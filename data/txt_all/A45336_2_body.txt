BRethren for so in the judgement of charity I cannot
but call you, though withal I must tell you that you
are erring Brethren, and such as are troubled with
the Falling-sickness; a disease very common in these
last and worst times. Had you faln forward, you
might have gained by your fall: to fall backward is
more dangerous;1 Sm. 4. 18. as we see in old Eli, who fell backward, brake his
neck, and died. But, which is worst of all, you are faln backward
into one of the most dangerous paths that men can fall into; viz.
the way of the Anabaptists who are (asSleid. Com∣ment, l. 5. and l. 10. Histories tell us) a turbulent
Sect, subverters of the very foundations of States, (viz. Magistracy
and Ministery) Satans factors, his Seedsmen to sowe Errours and
Heresies in the Nations;Simpson. Hist. p. 443. and how fruitfull they have been in this
kind,Spanheim. Eng. waning by Gr∣manies , p. 45, 46. we have sad experience amongst us. Heresie is of a spreading
nature: sowe but a few Tares, and they quickly overspread the
whole field: with fair words, and fine speeches, they deceive the
siple; with plaistred words they parget over the matter: like the
Whore of Babylon,2 Pet. 2. 3.  Rev. 17. that hath a golden cup to hold out to her fol∣lowers.
And that the world may see I do them no wrong, I shall present
you with a Looking-glass (collected out of approved Authors) where∣in
you may clearly see the wrinkles and deformities, the deliriums
and delusions of that deluded Sect; that by their fall, we may learn
to tremble, and fear, lest we also be tempted, and led away with the
errours of the wicked.
