AS in obedience to your fa∣vourable invitation, this Sermon was first preached, and the author conscious of his great unworthiness, employed in so honourable a work; so is it your pleasure (against which my judgement must not here contest) that hath thus exposed it to the publick view. Which yet I must confess doth not engage you in the patro∣nage of any of the crudities and imperfe∣ctions
 of this hasty work; It being the matter (which is of God) that so far prevailed for your acceptance, as to pro∣cure your pardon of the manner, which is too much my own. Rejoycing is so highly valued even by nature, that I thought it a matter of great necessity, to help to rectifie and elevate your joyes. The corruption of a thing so excellent must needs be very bad: And it being the great and durable Good, that must feed all great and durable joy: and seeing these little transitory things can cause but little and transitory delight: I thought it my duty to insist most on the greatest, on which in your meditations you must most insist: which I repent not of especially now you have given my doctrine a more loud and lasting voice; because it is only our Heavenly interest, that may be the
 matter of universal, continued delight, and so the subject may make the Sermon to be of the more universal and continu∣ed use, when a subject of less excellency and duration than heaven, would have depressed and limited the discourse as to its usefulness. And also I was forced in this (as in all these sublunary things) to estimate the Mercy in which we did all so solemnly rejoyce, but as a Means, which is so far to be valued as it condu∣ceth to its end; and is something or no∣thing as it relateth to Eternity. Since I placed my hopes above, and learned to live a life of faith, I never desire to know any mercy in any other form or name; nor value it on any other account: as not affecting to make such reckonings, which I daily see obliterated in grief and shame, by those that make them: and re∣membring
 who said, that if we had known Christ himself after the flesh, henceforth we know him so no more. As it was my compassion to the phrantick merry world, and also to the self-troubling me∣lancholy Christian, and my desire metho∣dically to help you in your rejoycings about the great occasions of the day, which formed this exhortation to what you heard, and chose the subject which to some might seem less suitable to the day; so if the publication may print so great and necessary a point on the hearts of any that had not the opportunity to hear, as God shall have the praise, and they the joy, so you shall have (under God) the thanks, and I the attainment of my end, which is my reward: I rest
