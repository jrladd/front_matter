THe motherly affection that you haue borne to∣wardes many, and to∣wardes my selfe (good Mis. Moore) puts me out of all doubt, that this speach of bounti∣fulnes and liberalitie shal finde good enter∣tainement at your hands. And I the more willingly commend these my labours vn∣to you, because of the blessed memorie of your good husband M. Moore, vnto whose doings the Lord hath set a most vi∣sible seale, by that blessing wherewith he hath blessed your children. For whereas commonly the kindred, especially the chil∣dren, are woont to coole the liberalitie of bountifull persons, yet it hath pleased God so to blesse your children, that they haue
 rather strengthened your handes in this worke. This speach may perhaps seeme to some to haue some cunning in it. But bee∣ing priuie to my selfe of my simplicitie in this matter, and knowing that the Apo∣stle doth for the like respect make an open proclamation to all the world of the boun∣tifulnes of the Macedonian Churches, I haue thereby beene encouraged to say as I haue said. Thus desiring the Lord to strēg∣then you in euery good dutie, and nothing doubting but that the God of all mercie which hath promised to shew mercie to the mercifull, will most assuredly comfort you in any distresse of sicknes, or any other trouble that your old yeares may bring in vpō you, especially at the great day, 2. Tim. 1. 18. with thankes for all your friendship, I heartily wish you well to fare in the Lord.
