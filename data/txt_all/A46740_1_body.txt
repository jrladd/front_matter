To His Grace, Christopher, Duke of Albemarle, Lieutenant General of Devon, and one of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, Grace and Peace from Jesus Christ, the Prince of Princes.
VVHen Your Grace's and this Kingdom's Father was flou∣rishing and living upon Earth, It pleased him to cast a favourable Aspect on me, the unwor∣thiest of all God's Ministers; so as that I could not but mind you, his Honourable Son and Heir, also, in the publishing of this Book, by a most humble Tender, and De∣dication of it to your Honourable Self, and to your great Name; and that so much the rather for this too, because you are the Ge∣neral of our Western Militia, and this Trea∣tise consists of Fighting, and sets forth a Bat∣tel (a Paper Battel I mean) fought in the West of England, whereof you are a Ge∣neral, between two Western Warriers, Pro and Con, about the thing called Usury; of whom, one, who is a professed Enemy to it, desireth to put himself, first under the great God's, and next under your Grace's Prote∣ction, by this most humble Dedication: wishing withal, by a Digression, that, be∣cause such a Paper Battel is too low for so
great a Person to take any great notice of it; I say, wishing that your Grace may mind much more that Spiritual Militia, which is called Wrastling with the God of Heaven for Heaven, which is held forth in and by Godliness Epitomized, which is a piece and part of this Book; so as to practise it during your Natural Life here on Earth, for the gaining of Eternal Life hereafter in Heaven.
But not being contented with wishing on∣ly, your Graces most humble Servant de∣sires to fall a praying for your Grace thus.
The Great Majesty of Heaven enable, strength∣en and animate your Grace with his Grace so successfully to wrestle for Heaven in Prayer, as that when you shall have superated the spaces of your Humane Life, you may, being born in the Arms of Angels, be carried up to the Head of Angels, the Lord Jesus, who is the Genera∣lissimus of all Generals and Christian Soldi∣ers, and for ever sheweth forth the Rays of his pleasant Face to the Vessels of Mercy which are destinated to ever-during Glory. So ends with Prayer,
