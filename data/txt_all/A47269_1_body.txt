Most Accomplisht Lady,
THE many singular Favours
which I have received, not
only from your worthy self, but
also from your thrice noble pro∣genitors,
justly oblige me by all
the duties of gratitude, to tender
a just acknowledgment: I wish
the same heart, that for many and
just causes truly honours, you, had
any present worthy your accep∣tance.
Now shall it be your singu∣lar
goodness to patronage this small
Treatise, which (if I mistake not)
carries with it two parts, Delight,

and Utility. I doubt not then, but
that it will find a general accep∣tance
among all those who are any
way the least lovers of such plea∣sing
and all delightful studies. I
intend not to paraphrase upon its
worth, its use, and singular profit,
which abundantly speaks it second
unto none that hath been publish∣ed
of the like nature: so hoping
you will accordingly esteem of it, I
beg pardon for my boldness, and
rest ever,
