I Am not a little sorie, Right Honourable, that bearing a desirous mind of long time to present vnto your view some argumente of my good mea∣ning towardes you, the happe hath so fallē out, that nothing hath yet hapned vnto me that way, eyther woorthie your honourable inspection, or answerable vnto my desired expectation. Neuerthe∣lesse, not through negligence to omit such oportuni∣tie as hath bin offered, least I might seeme slow in per∣fourmance, or carelesse in dutie: and taking in hand by the importune motion of some freends, not now to holde my pen in silence in respect of so rare matter as hath hapned of very late: suche as it is, so small, and so slender, in most humble wise I present vnto your ho∣nour. My right honourable good Lorde, it is a shorte discourse of all Earthquakes in generall, and also my poore iudgement touching the maruellous visitation of God in the terrible Earthquake whiche was felte of late dayes amongst vs. VVhich as I acknowledge to be but extemporall and weake, so do I submit it vnto the controulemente of better learned, leauing vnto them both matter and libertie to iudge and write thereof much more at large. And crauing at your ho∣nours

hands some maner friendly enterteyning of the same, if I may obteyne it, I shall not onely thinke my trauell well employed, but that of dutie I am farther endebted to make your honour, in respect of many great vertues that rest in the same, patrone of some better labour heereafter. As knoweth God, to whom I commend you, and pray for you, to your best content∣mente and liking. VVritten at London this thir∣teenth of April 1580. By him that remaineth your honours euermore at com∣mandement:
