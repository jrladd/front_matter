THat you are kept in watchfulness, in faith, and waiting for the Lord, whil'st others are eating and drinking with the drunken, and beating their fellow servants, is a mercy to your selves, a terror to the Enemy, and a refreshing to my soul.
The Cause, Spirit and Interest of late so contended for by men, and owned by God, that has for some time lain dead and buried in the hearts of many, and in the defections of this day seems to be rising again among you, and to receive some revivings through your Faith, and a fresh supply of the Spirit of Grace upon you.
As you have left behind you the low and carnal Principles of many, who propound no higher an issue to the late Administrations and Changes among us, than a worldly establishment of the Ecclesiastical and Civil State, and are looking after some better thing as provided for these last times, so the Lord direct you unto a right understanding what that good thing is that God will bring to pass in the Earth; that at least some of the tops of the Mountains and Rocks of that good Land may be in your eye, to strengthen and guid you whil'st you are labouring towards it, through the deeps of your infirmities, temptations and sufferings.
And as both inward and outward afflictions have alwaies attended them that have took part with the Lord, so you may look to meet with the same in your selves, especially at this day, wherein this old corrupt World drawing near its end, and Satan knowing his time is but short, will both combine their most principle Agents, their most exquisite skill, force and power, if possible, to cut off the faith, and hope and rem∣nant of them that love and wait for the glorious Coming and Kingdom of our Lord Jesus; wherefore for your help in the way, let me put you in mind of a few things.

Let your eye be unto the Lord Jesus; as his Appearance and King∣dom is the consummation of our faith and hopes, and the great and last issue intended by Providence in the Changes and Revolutions that have been and may yet come to pass among us; so setting him in the eye of your faith, will be of best use to direct and help you in all those works and af∣fairs that lead therunto: abide in Christ; so, whil'st the clouds and storms of temptations, troubles and sufferings, do beat upon your fl sh, in him you shall break through and overcome: you stand by faith; if you go forth in the confidence of your gifts, graces or any other privileges without the Lord, you shall fall as others before you have done and come to nothing.
In the late Changes and shakings that have been among us, the Lord Jesus was that Spirit that moved the wheels, and disposed all as the be∣ginning unto his last and great works of mercy and judgment, which he is determined to do, and wherein you should wait upon him in these last times: though the visible wheels seem to be at a stand, yet let your faith and pray∣er be going on, and you shall see, that our righteousness tarries not, and the judgment of our enemies slumbers not.
Let not the treachery and declination of these times from the interest of the Lord Jesus trouble you, in the falling of many Stars, the slumber∣ing of the Virgins, the defection of the Civil and Military instruments, the roaring of the Sea and Waters, that is, the rage of the people; but let these things rather encourage you to look up, for the summer, your Re∣demption draws nigh.
As God has appointed a day, wherein Jesus Christ shall shine forth in all his dignities and offices, as Law-giver, Saviour, King and Judge, and wherein all Kingdoms shall serve and obey him, that is, all Autho∣rities and Constitutions both in the Church and Wold shall be disolved, or refined into a subjection unto him, his Law and Kingdom; so there shall be no settlement unto any Govrnment or People, no success unto any Counsels or Policies new or old that shall rise up against the Lord or his People in this work: upon this stone have many of our Princes alrea∣dy falen, and the wheels of them that are since come up in their place are troubled, drive heavily, and the waters, their troubles do encrease upon them: th refore stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved, looking for him; for yet a little while of darkness and trouble upon the World, of temptations and trials upon your selves, and He that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.
