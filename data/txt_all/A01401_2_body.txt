HONORABLE LADY,
I Could flourish the colours of your Prayses from Vertue, Beautie, Gracefulnesse, Mag∣nanimitie, and such like en∣riching giftes of Nature: But at this time I will extend your worth no further, then that you are a faire promising Fruite of a glorious Tree; and so haue chosen you with the rest, to ouer-shade mee from the tempestes of De∣traction, considering I am now like a ceeled Doue to flye abroad with strange disguises, and haue as it were ma∣triculated my selfe in the Schoole of Folly, by writing of Bookes: Yet if you will relieue it, as a poore cast-out Orphan, then are you charitable: If you entertaine it for any cause in it selfe, then doe you Iustice: If you pardon the faults, then are you Vertuous: If you pro∣tect it, then are you Heroyicall: Nay, if you make it contemptible, I shall impute it to my owne ill deser∣uing,

not any deficiencie in you. But casting these doubts aside, I am confident, that you will either giue me leaue to make vse of your Honorable supportation; or lift me vp your selfe with so strong an arme, that neither Enuie nor Derision of others, shall shoulder me aside from your acceptation; or come neere you, that are willing to be so gentle and gracefull vnto mee,
