SIR, though this Poem's Title, fitted be
To what I hear, the World expects from me
Upon this Subject; yet, a seriousnesse
It hath, and shall no Flashie-things expresse;
For, tis a Flash of light, as well as Fire,
Which, may give sight of somthing you desire,
And such, as will no way disparage you,
To give them, either hearing, or, a veiw.


Betwixt your Highness and the Parlament,
I, purpose not to cherish that Dissent,
Which lately was begun; nor do intend
That, which may justly you, or them, offend;
But rather, to unite you so together,
That, Disadvantage, may befall to neither
By what, your Adversaries hope to finde
Effected; (if, you have a changing minde)
And, upon hope whereof, they did prepare
To act, according as resolv'd you were.


I am not for my self, yet, grown so wise
That, when at hazzard, Publick safety lies,
I can be silent; though I both disease
My self; and others, oftentimes, displease,
By my expressions, who, have pow'r and will,
To mischieve me, who, purpose them no ill:
For, though a well approved Author sayes,
To please great men, it merits not least praise;
I think, he merits more, who speaks in season,
Truths, warranted by conscionable Reason,
(Although on him, a Prince's wrath it brings)
Then, if he flatter'd Parlaments and Kings.


In that respect, I judg'd it not amisse,
Unto your ear, or eye, to offer this,
A few weeks past: But, things did intervene
That seem's of more concernment to have been;

And kept it off, untill nigh out of date,
It was become; and came almost too late.
Yet, since good use may thereof still be made,
And some advantage also, thereby had;
It, now comes forth, that, witnesse it might bear
To that, which now, resolv'd on, doth appeare.


For, though we know there is in every thing,
But one Essential Truth; yet, thence may spring
Such various Illustrations, as perchance,
The certainty thereof, may much advance,
When it appears, they, did the same Truths own,
Whose judgments, to each other were unknown:
For, when there is thereof no mediation
But, as their spirits have communication,
It doth assure, it flow'd from Providence,
And, not from any carnal influence.


Your eye, sees much: and yet it cannot see
It self, or, what the colours of it be,
Save by inferiour things; and, through inspections
Acquired, by the medium, of reflexions
From sight-less objects; through which; you may lear
Those truths, which they themselves, do not discern:
And, such like Objects, peradventure, He
Who offers this and these his offers be.


SIR, therefore nowâ–ª be pleas'd, one houre, to hear
What, by my Muse, is fitted for your ear,
And was prepar'd long since, to be presented
(Though accidentally, till now prevented)
And, if it be not such, as, then, will seem
To merit, some part, of your good esteem,
And, usefull to preserve, and to increase
Your Honour, safety, and the Common-peace;
Return it, with an Ignominious Dash,
And, let it then, (in scorn) be call'd, a Flash.
