My Lord,
THese Contemplations belong to your Lordship by double right, as fruits growne and ripened at the rayes of your favour, and as characters of those vertues whereby you have wrestled out the difficulties of an age of Iron and Fire; The roughnesse of those stormes makes your present tran∣quillity look smoother, & your Lordship takes the right course to have tranquil∣lity at home in any weather, consecra∣ting
your heart to be a Sanctuary of the God of peace, where you entertaine him by faith, love, and good works; not ser∣ving the world, but making the world to serve you; keeping a constant march through the various occurrences of both fortunes, with a meeke & resolute equa∣nimity, and a prudent sincerity. To keep your minde in that golden frame, if these endeavours of mine may be instrumental, they shall but refund what they have re∣ceived, for to that tranquillity which I enjoy under your noble shelter, I owe these meditations of tranquillity. May they prove of the nature of those seeds which improve the soyle where they grow. And may your good soul reape some fruit of these productions of your favour and my thankfulnesse. I rest
At your Man∣nour of Lismore July 30. 1655.
MY LORD
