WORSHIPFVLL GENTLEMEN,
ANd Foster Fathers of my Academie, I present you heere, neither with Iasons voyage to Colcos, nor the Golden fleece as yet, but with the best of my endeavours to the North-west, which wee poore Discoverers are so eered about, (with so much Phylosophy) as though these Voyages have spent so much time and treasure as it is not able to redeeme it selfe by being guld with the false. Sea cards or fabulous reports of strangers, for no Nation in the World knoweth so much of this as your selves, nor neede wee neither the arguments of Phylosophy to examine so much variety, and that so various as the Schoole-men

finde out, nor (for their inquisitions or disquisitions) their Mr. A∣ristotle did not know, what time since his hath brought forth, and since him wee have almost found out the reason for the Tide, about which some of them have writ he drown'd himself because he could not, nor you neede not got to the N. W. passage to seeke the Philoso∣phers-stone, having one of your owne by which you have angled, levelled, and brigged over the Ocean, from this Monarch to the furthest East and West, the touch thereof hath made you attended home (as the shadow the substance) with the Tawny Peruian and the Sunne-burnt Black-moore Affricans Gold, the rich Sparkling Diamond, the night shining Carbunckle, the Physicall Beazer, the Emerald, Saphire, and the Orient Indian Pearle, adorning the Lilly necks of the most dainiest Ladies, with other of pleasure and price; besides the Drugges, Ʋigitables, Simples and Balsoms for health; and all these and farre more emm of wealth and trea∣sure hath the vertue of your Adamant stone exported hither, to the enriching and honouring of our Nation.
I pray that when this abortive shall come to your view, that you passe over its deformity and imperfections (which nature in hast stampt it into, in which it still remayneth, both for want of meanes and Art) and your private admonition shall cause me amend it at the next Edition, for with this I am glad I have not overchar∣ged the presse (as fearing) the worst part of which is already be∣fale (in Erataes) for which if I should excuse my selfe, I know both the Compositor, and the Correcter will witnesse with me in taking the fault upon themselves, I have done my endevour to correct the most palpable, as mistaking words or non-sence, which not being ac∣quainted with our Sea termes they might easily commit, and for the faults in letters, I know your Arithmetick can make whole numbers of Fractions, if these faults had beene committed by my selfe in the Copie I might with some reason have pleaded an excuse, being no Scholler and having had no helpe, which I did knw was very need∣full, but was not able to buy it, and I was told it would not be had for naught, especially by the Scholler that was acquainted with the language of the Sea; therefore now I feele the want of Mr. Hack∣luit, and so I doubt will others in time to come, who for the good of his Country stored those Journals at his owne charge.
Whereupon not knowing otherwise how to proceede, I was en∣forced with such Tackling, Cordage, and Raftage, as I had, to Rigge and Tackle this ship my selfe. I hope shee will saile the

better in this Trimm, if you be pleased to conduct her, which I doubt not but you will, having heretofore observed your favours in cherishing and preferring young Sea-men, with your charity  others, not onely in your Almes-deeds to the Fatherlesse and Or¦phans, but your continuall maintinance with all necessaries to a∣ged poore Widdowes and decayed Mariners, your compassion and reliefe to the distressed ship-wrackt-Seamen farre from home, and others, your priviledge to aied Men, with the right in Ju∣stice you dot to those that are not able to wage law for the same, de∣serveth to be inrolled amongst the greatest acts of Christian cha∣ritie.
And for that your helpefull care towards my furnishing  with all materials for this service, your loving aspects and bounty since my home comming, hath obliged me to acknowledge your fa∣vours, with thankes, I desire your kind acceptance, and the rather because it is the Present of your younger Brother,
