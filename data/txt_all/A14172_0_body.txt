AS there is no field, be it neuer so wel tilled, and be the seede ne∣uer so good that is sowne in the same, but weedes will of their owne accorde spring therin, and without the diligent

care of the husband-man, choake the good seede, and deceiue the owner of the expected fruit of his former labour: so there hath neuer since the world be∣gan (right honorable) bene any church so pure without corruption, that hath not had many blemishes in the same: the which without the great mercie of God, and prouident care of the gouer∣nours thereof, both hath, and doeth, & to the ende of the world will, so growe and encrease, that they will neuer staye, vntill they haue brought to passe the vtter subuersion and ouerthrow of reli∣gion there professed: for if we beginne with the Church of the Iewes, not one∣ly the first visible, & established church, but also the image and picture of the Church of God for euer: and consider what corruptions haue crept into the same, howe they haue increased from time to time, & often preuailed against the sincere worship of God, to the vtter ouerthrow of true religion, and streng∣thening of idolatrie: it is so manifest in the bookes of Moses, Kings, and the

Prophets, that either we must refer the consideration thereof, to those places, or els (which is needeles) make a whole volume of the discourse of the same. We see the same practize in the Primi∣tiue Church, euen in the time of the A∣postles, that both corruption of doc∣trine, and also loosenes in conuersation, did greatly infect that age. The which is euident in the times following, and euen vntill this day: that the true doc∣trine of the Gospel hath bene most bla∣sphemously peruerted, and godlesnesse in life so rooted into the heart of man, that the number of true Christians hath euer bene a small, poore, and contem∣ned flocke. And in truth, we neede goe no further than to these present times, wherein we liue: in which (because tho∣rough the great mercy of our good and gracious God, the seedes of Popishe tares can take no such roote, as Satan wisheth) we may behold, and (to the great griefe of Christian hartes) too plainely see, how greatly Atheisme and vngodlines preuaileth, that it is a hard

matter, euen in this bright sunne shine of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, to finde many of them, that together with puri∣tie of religion, doe studie to keepe a sin∣cere and vpright conscience, in their life. For religion (now adayes) is made a cloake, to hide sinne: a myst, to bleere the eyes of the world: a den, for trans∣gressors: and a cage, for all vncleane birds in the world. All which springeth hence, that Satan can perswade men, that if they professe themselues to be Gospellers, and make shew of religion, it is not onely sufficient, (because no man shall be saued by his works) but al∣so it shall bring them into more credite and estimation in the world, thereby to growe greater: which bringeth forth these three most pernicious and daun∣gerous euills among men: first, that the Papists, (who measure all things by the outward shew) are not onely kept from listening to the truth, but also more hardened in their blind superstition. Se∣condly, that the glorie of the highe and mightie God, which should shine in our

liues, by the Gospell, is trampled vnder feete. Lastly, that their owne soules and bodies are in a most daungerous estate, (being driuen by the prouocation of the deuil) headlong into the pit of con∣demnation, whereinto so many, as with out repentance, runne on to the ende, must needes fall at length, feeling the torments increased vnto them: that (for laying stumbling blocks in the way to ouerthrow others, and defacing the glory of the great God, and proceeding in satisfieng their owne appetite with sinne) they haue most iustly deserued. The consideration of which mischiefe, moued certaine godly, and well dispo∣sed persons, (who were by the proui∣dence of God, eare witnesses of a dis∣course, that it pleased the Lord to strēg∣then me, to vtter in my ordinary course, vpon the Acts of the Apostles) earnest∣ly to intreate me, that I woulde penne the same, for their further comfort: which good & godly motion of theirs, for that it proceeded (I doubt not) from an earnest desire in them, of spiri∣tuall

edification, I condiscended vnto. And because it hath pleased God, to make me, by speciall dutie, bound vnto your Honor: I therefore haue made es∣peciall choice of the same: wherevnto, these my simple & small labours might be dedicated, most humbly beseeching your honor, that, as it is the summe and substance of all the religion, taught, and professed in this poore Towne of King∣ston, so it would please your L. to ac∣cept therof, not according to the quan∣titie (that is but small) nor expecting the inticing words of mans wisedome, (which is most vnfit for the Gospell of Christ) but according to the substance of the thing, and the mind of the poore labourer. So shall your Honor bind me, (which notwithstanding is my duetie) with the rest of them, that feare God, a∣mong vs, to pray continually vnto the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, for you: that it woulde please him, so to direct, guide, and blesse all your enterprises, as may best tende to the glorie of his most blessed name, the benefit of his Church,

and this common weale, and the eternal & euerlasting com∣fort of your owne soule.
