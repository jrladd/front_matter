Sir,
THere is no man who has heard of the House of Nor∣folk, and especially of that of Arundel and Surrey, but will justifie the reso∣lution I have taken to Inscribe Your Name in the Front of this Piece; since the names of Painting, and Sculpture (two of the most celebrated and renown∣ed Arts that ever appear'd in the world)

had scarce been known amongst us in England, but for your Illustrious Grand∣father, who brought into, and adorn'd this Nation with more polite and use∣ful things, than it had received for some Ages before, and who continu'd a Me∣coenas and Protector of all the subli∣mer Spirits, as long as this Island was Worthy of him, which was as long as it remained Loyal.
I have great reason to Consecrate thus his Memory, of whose more particular Favours I have so frequently tasted both at Home and Abroad; especially in Italy, where I had the honor to be che∣rish'd by him, and from whence I after∣wards receiv'd one of the last Letters that ever he Writ, which I reserve by me amongst the choicest of my Trea∣sures.
From Him, through a most Illustrious Father, this Affection to great and noble things is derived to You: Witness, the Asylum which the ROYAL-SOCIETY

found in your own Pa∣lace, when the most fierce and merciless of the Elements subverted her first A∣bodes; and now (besides other Accu∣mulations) your free and glorious Do∣nation of a fonds upon your own Ground, to establish her on for ever, and fix her at your very Threshold, by which you not only oblige the most grateful and useful Assembly, that a∣ny Age has produc'd, but do honor likewise to His Majesty our Founder, by signifying your respect so eminently to his Royal Institution.
But, Sir, I have something yet to add, and the very Stones would even exclaim against me, should I omit your never-to-be-forgotten Munificence to the University of Oxford; because it was upon my First and Sole Suggestion (for Instigation, the Generosity of your Nature needs not) that You were pleas'd to inrich that renowned Seat of the Muses, with a greater Gift, than

all the World can present it; because the World cannot shew such a Collecti∣on of Antiquities: And this Great Thing You did, when You plac'd the MARMORA ARVNDELI∣ANA There. First, the Greek, and then, the Latine Inscriptions; by which You not only nobly Consulted the most Lasting way to perpetuate Your Name in the Learned World, and gave Eter∣nity to those (almost) obliterated Ti∣tles, by transferring them to a less Cor∣rosive Ayr; but did likewise a piece of Justice, and Piety too, in Restoring that to the Daughter, which came from the Mother, and Consigning those An∣tiquities to Oxford, which were taken away from Athens.
Sir, in my Letter to You into Surrey, (now about a Year since) concerning this Largesse, I cannot forbear to repeat a line or two, which was to move your Honor in one particular more; and that is, that you would one day, cause the

choicest of your Statues, Basse relievos, and other noble pieces of Sculpture, standing in you Galleries at Arundel-House, to be exquisitely design'd by some sure hand, and engraven in Copper, as the late Justiniano set forth those of Rome, and since him (and several others) Monsieur de Lion-Court by the Draughts of Perier; as formerly that incomparable Historical-Columne of the Emperor Trajan, was cut by Villame∣na with the Notes of divers Learned men upon them: Because by this means, the World might be inform'd in whose Possession those Rarities are; and that it would so much contribute to the Glo∣ry of the Countrey, their Illustrious Owner, and his Family; as it has for∣merly, and yet does, to those noble Ita∣lians, and great Persons beyond the Alps, who have not been able to produce such a Collection as You are furnish'd with, but who are honor'd, and celebrated for it, all the World over, by this virtuous,

and yet no very expenseful Stratagem.
I was the rather incited to mention This here, because I understand there are some Learned Persons now at Oxford, adorning a new Impression of the Mar∣mora, in which, such a Work could not pass without due veneration, and would prove a considerable ornament to the designe; and indeed, because the Argu∣ment of the Discourse I am entertain∣ing your Honor with, (dedicated lately to the French Kings onely Brother) does prompt me to it, as my very great Obli∣gations, to subscribe my selfe.
Illustrious Sir,

Says-Court,
Iune 24. 1668.
