May it Please Your Grace.
THe AUTHOR having made PSYCHE Yours by his Humble Dedication, these Compositions with the same Submission Prostrate Themselves to your Grace, who gave them Life by your often hearing them practis'd, and encourag'd & heartn'd the almost heartless Undertakers & Performers.
MY LORD,
I humbly beg your Graces Pardon for this Presumption, and your Favour that I may Subscribe my self,
Your Graces, Most Obliged Humble Servant,
MATTHEW LOCK.
