Right Honorable,
DIfferences in the Church have always caused differences in the Commonwealth; and dif∣ferences in the Commonwelth do commonly widen those differences in the Church. Differences in Religion did cause these unhappy and unnatural
 Wars; and these Wars have not ended but encreased them. For notwithstand∣ing the Solemn League and Covenant to extirpate all Popery, Heresie, Schism, &c. and in pursuance thereof your late pious Ordinance to stop their farther growth, besides the excellent labours of many learned men, yet Heresies are encreased above number, like the unruly waters, the more they are stopt, the more they rage and swell. And indeed Heresie, Prophaness, Barbarism, and Atheism it self have always and in all places follow∣ed war as close as famine or pestilence do; times of war and confusion, being as fit times for the envious man to sow his tares in, as times of peace, sleep or security. And now for composing these differences; The Italians in a pro∣verbial speech use to say, that Hard to Hard never makes good stone-wall: Meaning, that in any difference, there must be some yeelding, or else there can never be any firm uniting. In matters of Religion, I have vntured to do some∣thing, my calling thereunto engaging me, with extream longings to see peace and truth settled amongst us: These poor labors, I humbly present unto
 your Honors, hoping your Honors will take in good part, what is intended to a good end, though perhaps it may come much short of it; and accept the work though small, seeing the smallest stone will help to repair the greatest breach.
