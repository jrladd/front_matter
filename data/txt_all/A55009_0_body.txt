My LORD,
THE Manuscript now herewith delivered to your Servant, had two days since been brought to Your Lordship, had I not so long disputed with my self, Whether it were more decent for me to send it

single, or to give it an Epistle for a companion. Nor was it so easie a matter for me to determin this my doubt; the contrary reasons that offered themselves to my perpension, seeming to me to be of equal weight
When, on one side, I considered how immense a multiplicity of af∣fairs, and those of great importance too, come hourly crowding into your thoughts, expecting from you to be at once both judged and dispatched with highest Prudence; and how few minutes you have to spare from cares of State: I was inclined to conclude, that the perusal of the Book alone, without the importunity of a Letter, might too much interrupt your re∣pose, and the public felicity. To this was added, that neither Socrates nor Plato could need Letters of re∣commendation to a man so well ac∣quainted with the Heroic Virtues of

the one, and the Divine Doctrin of the other. Nay I thought it a kind of Sacrilege against their Merits, as well as against your Judgement, but to imagine, that any thing I could write to introduce them, might in∣crease your esteem of them.
When, on the other, I remem∣ber'd that the Book contains, not an Original, but a Copy; not the intire Images of those two so justly re∣nowned Philosophers, but only two select pieces of them, namely the up∣right and invincible Heart of the one, and the perspicacious Eye of the other (I mean the Defense of Socra∣tes, and the discourse of the Immor∣tality of Mans Soul) and that I owed Your Lordship, not only the free use thereof, but also an accompt of the reasons I had to allege in excuse (I must not say, justification) of the little art shewn by me in the Tran∣script:

remembring this, I say, I could not but think it convenient, to draw a few lines more, in order to your satisfaction concerning that particular. Besides this, gratefully re-calling to mind, that you had long before honour'd me, not only with licence, but with express Com∣mand also, to write to you, and that frequently too, especialy concerning matters Philosophical; and being of opinion, that this Book contains one of the noblest Disquisitions any where to be found among the monu∣ments of even the Ancient Grecian Philosophers: I was apt to conceive it to be more probable (your ex∣traordinary Candor together conside∣red) that my omission to do it, upon this inviting occasion, might carry the face of Disobedience; than that my doing it would be look'd upon as importune or indecent.
And this last reason, in weight exceeding all the moments put into the opposite Scale, at length turned the balance of my suspence; and made me conclude, that certainly I should less offend by a fault for which I might plead the authority of Your Lordships Command, than by one that could not be otherwise ex∣cused, but by confessing my distrust of your Benignity, and diffidence of your Favour, wherein chiefly I esteem my self to be happy.
Notwithstanding this, I still found my self obliged, so far at least to give ear to the former arguments that would have dissuaded me from wri∣ting, as to resolve to make my fault as little and venial as was possible, by writing no more than should seem necessary to the defens of the Plain∣ness, and familiar Style used by me, in the version of these two so excel∣lent

Discourses of Plato into our Language. For that seems chiefly to require an Apology: the admira∣ble Wisedom, great Ʋtility, and charming sweetness of the Discourses themselves, being already perfectly known to Your Lordship, and ac∣knowledged by universal consent of the Learned in all ages, since it be∣came a doubt, whether Athens were more to be honoured for the birth of Socrates, or to be branded with in∣famy and hatred for the cruel mur∣der of him. And as for the Occasi∣on of my translating them; you are so far from needing to be adver∣tised thereof, that you made it my Province: that is, from your just admiration of the incorruptible Justice of Socrates, expressed in a Colloquy at your Table (where the Minds, no less than the bodies of your Guests are always feasted)

I took the first hint of the design, and proceeded therein by your ap∣probation; which with me, is equi∣valent to an injunction.
Suffer me then, my Lord, briefly to acquaint you, that if in this di∣version of my pen, I have not only confined it, as strictly as my weak judgement would permit me to do it, within the bounds of the Authors sense; but caused it also whereso∣ever I could, to trace out his very Expressions, and render them even word for word: it was not that I imagined that way to be either more facil, or more elegant; but because I judged it to be the more faithful, and I had design'd, not a Paraphrase, but a Translation. By comparing the Latin version of Marsilius Ficinus with that of Serranus, I had found these two great men not seldom vari∣ous, somtimes dubious, and som∣times

irreconciliable in their inter∣pretations: so that both could not be in the right; and to me who had not been sufficiently versed in the dialect and style of Plato, nor com∣petently skilled in the Criticisms of the Greek, it was extremely diffi∣cult to discern, which of the two came nearest to the true and genuine sense of the Author; more especialy where it was probable they had fol∣lowed different Exemplars, and cer∣tain that even their best Editions of Plato were not sufficiently correct. To extricate my self from this per∣plexity, I was constrained to take this course. Where the Greek Text ap∣pear'd to me to be of it self plain and perspicuous, I seldom consulted any other Oracle. Where the same seem'd obscure by words of ambi∣guous signification, and used Meta∣phoricaly: first I sought to let in

light upon the place, by opening the casements both of the antecedent and subsequent Context; and if thereby I could discern the mind of those words, I had recourse to the Inter∣preters also, though merely for con∣firmation. Where I found my self intangled both in the abstruseness of the Text, and in the discrepancy of its interpretations; I chose to adhere to the more consentaneous, which most frequently was that of Serra∣nus; and where the interpretations were not only different, but inca∣pable of consistency and reconci∣liation: there I was forced to grope out my way by probable Conjecture, as being destitute of other help. Here to expatiate into a particular Catalogue of these Difficulties, and adfer instances of each sort of them; is neither to my present scope neces∣sary, nor consistent with the module

of an Epistle: and after this gene∣ral accompt, it seems more decent for me to render a reason, why I so far mentioned them. Be pleased therefore to know, that I have done it, not to derogate from the glory and authority of those two so de∣servedly celebrated names of Ficinus and Serranus, from whose immortal Works I hold my self scarcely wor∣thy to wipe the dust, and without whose conduct and manuduction I could not have been able to proceed without stumbling at almost every step: but only to make your Won∣der the less, when you shall find me, not only stumbling, but Erring also from the direct path of Plato's sen∣timents and intention; which I fear I have more than once done. For, if such men as they were, met som∣times with Knots they could not un∣ty: what wonder is it, that I who

am so much their inferior both in learning and judgement, should be often embroil'd in doubts I cannot solve? if They who have shewn themselves both exquisitely Critical in the Greek of the Ancients, and intimately conversant even in the most mysterious notions, and pro∣found recesses of the Platonic Philo∣sophy, openly dissent from, and clash one with the other, about the genuin sense of many hundreds of places therein occurring: how much of fa∣vour is due to this weak Essay of one, who is neither good Grecian, nor so much as a mean Platonist? I may therefore expect from Your Lordship, rather reprhension for at∣tempting above my strength, than blame for performing below my hopes. Now, my Lord, that I may draw all the lines of this long Para∣graph to a point; this very Reason

here brought to excuse my Deviati∣ons (if I be found guilty of any such) from the sense, may well serve also to justifie my strict adhesi∣on to the Words of my Author, wheresoever the vast disparity be∣twixt the most significant Idioms of Plato's Greek, and those of our Babel of Languages, the English, would permit. For, as a Novice in the Art of Painting, though he come short of the life, will yet more cer∣tainly represent the true dimensions of the thing he designs to paint, and the becoming Symmetry of all its parts; if he transgress not the lines drawn to his hand by a Master, to circumscribe the image, and confine his pencill to the due proportions thereof: so I being to copy the Sen∣timents of Another, believ'd I should be the less prone to err, by how much the less I receded from the Marks he

had left of them: and hereupon I resolved to do my best devoir, first to understand those Marks distinctly, and then to represent their Significa∣tions faithfully: preferring plain imi∣tation to more artificial ornament. Not that I had then forgot, there are intruth certain Modes of speak∣ing, and graceful Phrases proper and peculiar to every Language, so as to be incapable of alienation or tradu∣ction; and certain Subjects also that are, as by natural congruity, much more agreeably and patheticaly ex∣press'd by one Tongue, than by any other: and that therefore a Transla∣tor ought to be allowed competent liberty to use such words, phrases and figures of speech, as he shall judge most fit, as well to conserve the beauty and elegance of the origi∣nal conception, as to symbolize and suit with the argument; and this lest

his style become pedantique and flat, and the Matter it self be debased, as the best Wines lose their Spirit by transfusion from vessel to vessel. But that I well remembred, that an Emi∣nent Wit of Your Lordships acquain∣tance, who had with severity enough declamed against verbal Translati∣ons, was yet at the same time so in∣genuous, as to grant some Books to be of so great and universal impor∣tance, as that not only their Sense, but even their Words too ought to be reputed Sacred: and that I con∣ceived these two pieces of Plato, more especialy that of the Soul, whereof the Speculations are for the most part Metaphysical or Theological, deserved to be of that number. Hereunto was conjoyned a Second consideration, viz. That by keep∣ing close to the Words of the Text, even in the Ornamental parts of the

Discours, I might not only the bet∣ter avoid the danger of either ener∣vating the Expressions, or offering such violence to the Sense of it, as might make it appear rather mine than my Authors; but also retain some impressions of the civil manner and way used by those Ancient Sages in their frank Conferences, and im∣passionate Disputations concerning matters Philosophical: a thing not unworthy the serious notice of those who are strangers to the Atticism and admirable Civility of Plato; and, the Morosity and obstinacy of our Modern Disputants considered, to all Exemplary. These, my good Lord, are the Reasons that induced me to labour to shew my self, in this diverting Essay, rather fidum Meta∣phrasten, than disertum Paraphrasten; rather just than polite. And as for the plainness of my style (if that

be a fault) though it be the natural consequent of my fidelity; yet I have this further to plead in defense thereof, that the gravity of the Sub∣ject exacted it: for, as the Prince of Roman Stoics most judiciously observes (Epist. 40.) quae veritati operam dat oratio, incomposita debet esse & simplex.
Hitherto, my Lord, I have offen∣ded against your patience, by forcing you to hear my Apology: be pleas'd now to let me expiate that offens, by exercising the same a minute or two longer, while I recall into your memory some of those many Heroic Virtues of Socrates, whereof his grate∣ful Disciple, Plato, hath left to us such remarkable instances, both in his Apology, and in the accurate nar∣ration of the manner and circumstan∣ces of his Death.
This poor Philosopher, my Lord, seems to be the man upon whom the bounty of Heaven accumulated all the various Gifts, it useth to distri∣bute but singly and with a sparing hand to other Mortals: and the least of his divine Endowments hath often sufficed to render even private per∣sons illustrous, and Sceptres them∣selves more august.
Had you beheld him in arms, with his Sword rescuing Xenophon, and standing alone confronting a victori∣ous army, when the Athenian forces fled from the battell of Delium: you would have seen Wisedom recon∣ciled to Warre, Judgement moving hand in hand with Fury, and the Rational faculty of the Soul concur∣ring in the same action with the Iras∣cible; and thereupon concluded, that true Valour arises, not from heat of blood, nor from excess of Choler,

but from strength and resolution of Mind; and that a good Philosopher may make an excellent Captain. Had you seen him in another Expediti∣on, returning a Conquerour from Potidaea, and transferring all the ho∣nours and rewards due to so signal a victory, upon his beloved Alcibiades, reserving to himself no other place in the Triumph but among the fol∣lowers of his Friend: You might have sworn, he had fought so brave∣ly rather for Conscience, than for ei∣ther Glory or Spoyl; and that he desired no greater name than that of a good Patriot and sincere Friend.
When you reflect upon his fearless refusal to execute the Command he had received from the supreme Coun∣cil of Athens, to fetch Leo Salami∣nius from Salamine, to be put to death, according to the Sentence given against him by the Usurper Cri∣tias

and his Adherents: you will (I presume) acknowledge, that he fear'd nothing but to do ill, that he disdain'd to assert any power that was not just, that Athens it self might with more ease have been re∣moved to Salamine, than he brought to relinquish Right and Equity; and that he was more ready to accompa∣ny the oppressed in their Sufferings under Tyranny, than to be a sharer in the administration of it. Had some Roman been a witness of this virtuous obstinacy, he would have cried out perhaps, that the Capitol it∣self was not more immoveable than the integrity of Socrates; and envi∣ed Greece the glory of so rare an Ex∣ample. What then would he have said. my Lord, had he been present at the dispute betwixt the same So∣crates and his most faithful Scholar Crito, wherein he being with no weak

arguments urged, to evade the exe∣cution of that most unjust Sentence lately pass'd upon him, and deliver himself from violent death by an escape plotted and prepared to his hand; nevertheless not only rejected that affectionate advice, but by de∣monstration convinced the Author of it, that the auctority of Law, and Decrees of Courts of Judicature, are things in their sanction so vene∣rable and sacred, as to oblige men to submission, even when they are manifestly unjust; and brought him at length to acquiesce in this Con∣clusion, nefas sibi esse è carcere egredi, injussu Magistratus, & contra legum autoritatem? Herein whether Socra∣tes were in the right or not, let our Civilians determin: I, for my part, verily believe, he thought he was; and this is most evident, that he could never be either overcome by terrors,

or won by allurements, to recede so much as a hairs bredth from what he had once defined to be just. This very Monosyllable doubtless was his whole Decalogue, equivalent to the Laws of the twelve Tables among the Romans, the basis of his Religion, the Centre of his Counsels, and rule to his actions: nor can I be easily persuaded, that Astrea left to dwell among men untill after his death. Of his obedience to the Laws and consti∣tutions of his City, he gave this fur∣ther testimony; that when the Athe∣nian Republic, to repair their people much exhausted by warre and pesti∣lence, had made an Edict, that every man of fit years should be obliged to espouse one woman, as principal wife, and have liberty to take another, for procreation: he, notwithstanding he had his hands full of unquiet Xan∣tippe (whose peevishness and moro∣sity

was grown to be the daily exer∣cise of his patience at home, and his reproch abroad) yet in conformity to the Edict, fear'd not to receive into his little house and narrow bed, another Consort also, one Myrto, daughter of that Aristides surnamed the Just, but equaly poor with him∣self. This certainly could not but be somwhat harsh and disagreeable to a man already entered into the confines of old age, and understan∣ding the pleasures of serenity and re∣pose: and yet I must not imagin it to have been at all difficult to the wisedom of our Socrates, whose tranquillity appears to have been ele∣vated, like the head of mount Athos, above the tempest of feminin conten∣tions, jealousies and impertinences, and his Mind incapable of peturba∣tions. However, he put not private cares into the balance against a duty

to the Public: but chose to be a good Citisen, by increasing Posteri∣ty, though he were sure thereby to multiply his own domestic incom∣modities.
Acting by this infallible principle of Justice (which is, as Plato calls it, , the greatest of hu∣man goods, and Mother of all other virtues) and fully persuaded of the divinity and immortality of the Soul (which is the fundament of all Re∣ligion) and of future rewards and punishments: the wonder is the less, that this admirable man was able, both to trample upon all the splen∣did and precious things of this mo∣mentany life, and to bid defiance to all the terrible: for, secure in his own innocence, and confident of happiness to come; 'twas less diffi∣cult to him either to contemn dan∣gers, or resist temptations. Nay,

to do him right, neither could this Temperance, nor that Fortitude be at all difficult to him, who by long use, and continual practice, had exalted them from Virtues into Habits.
In the first, he appear'd to be so perfect, that tho as a man he could not but feel the motions and sollici∣tations of Corporeal Appetites, yet none of them dared to rebell against the Soveraignty of Reason, by whose power he alwaies both ruled and bounded them: nor could even a good Soul separated from its body, and delivered from all encumbrances of Matter, have acted more sedately, or been less incommodated with Passions. In a word, in his whole life, he seem'd not only unconcern'd in, but insensible of the vain appea∣rance of human things.
Being thus impenetrable to Cupi∣dities, it may be worth our labour to

enquire also, how strong he was against Fear. That we may therefore take the true hight of his Courage, let us (if it please Your Lordship) observe his deportment at the bar, in the prison, and at his death.
At the Tribunal, we hear his Con∣stancy no less than his Innocency tri∣umphing over the power and ma∣lice of his combined Accusers: the greatest hurt they can do to me, saith he, is to think it possible to hurt me; since God takes care of Good men, and they therefore can never be violated by wicked men. To a friend whispering in his ear, that his Judges had before resolved to doom him to death: he answers softly and with a smile (but such a smile as re∣tain'd an aire of Gravity and Dig∣nity) and hath not Nature passed the same doom upon them? Retiring af∣ter his condemnation, Adieu my

friends, saith he, I am now going to suffer death, ye to enjoy life: God alone knows, which of the two is better.
In the Prison, we find him de∣spoil'd of whatever Fortune could take from him, his body covered with raggs and loaden with chains, his leggs galled and cramp'd with fet∣ters, his eyes entertain'd with no objects but a wife and Infant weep∣ing: and yet for all this, we hear no complaints, no lamentations, no grones, no not so much as one sigh come from him; but discourses con∣solatory and divine. Good God, how great is the power of Wise∣dom! how invincible the courage of a Soul armed with virtue! If this mans condition be Happy (as certainly it is) how much are Mor∣tals generaly mistaken in the notion of Happiness! Here we behold a

shew of Misery in extremity: but realy there is no such thing. For if you look more intently upon So∣crates, you shall discern in him all the signs of alacrity, all the chara∣cters of Joy. To see him so uncon∣cern'd, a man would think, he were not a Sufferer, but a Comforter. There is (Your Lordship well knows) a sort of natural Authority inherent in the very Persons of some men, resulting perhaps from certain characters of a great Mind, which heroic virtue imprints upon their countenance: and this as it corrects the imperfections of nature, where it meets with any; so doth it like∣wise adorn the nakedness of its owner exposed to the outrages of fortune, illuminate his dungeon, and strike fear and reverence into the heart of even Executioners; as you may remember it did into his, who came

to kill that noble Roman, Caius Ma∣rius. Now this indelible Character of true Greatness, do I clearly per∣ceive in the face of our Hero's, with its rayes enlightning the obscurity of his prison, consecrating his disgraces, chains and raggs, and rendring his afflictions holy and venerable. Nor can his Executioner endure the flashes of it, without astonishment, vene∣ration and tears: and you may hear him, after a little recollection of himself, sobbing forth this acknow∣ledgement. Farewell Socrates, saith he, The most generous and best of Men that ever came into this place. Which words being imperfectly pronoun∣ced, he instantly retires; and una∣ble to perform the duety of his place, he sends in another with the poyson.
Which being presented to Socra∣tes, behold with what calmness of

Spirit, what gravity of aspect, and how steady a hand he receives it, and drinks, as if that draught were to ex∣tinguish, not his life, but thirst. Nor did his Fortitude grow cold with his blood, or sink with his vital powers; for even in the extreme agony of death, in the last pulse of his heart, when the vital flame ceased to warm him: then did the flame of his Cou∣rage still continue, and animated him to breath forth words that signifie, his dissolution was most grateful to him, as a deliverance from the Sickness of Mortality, and passage to immortal Happiness. Which I am verily per∣suaded, he now enjoys: his whole life seeming to me, as Erasmus (in ) ingenuously declared it did to him, nothing but a great Ex∣ample of justice, temperance and pati∣ence; so that if ever any among the Ethnics came neer to the perfection

of a Christian life, it cannot be denied but Socrates was the man. It is not (I profess) my custom to address my praiers to any but God alone, who (I am most certain) both hears, and hath power to grant my petitions: and yet I blush not to confess, that whenever I read what Plato, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, Eunapius Sardia∣nus among the Greeks, and Cicero and Seneca among the Latins, have written in commemoration of the ad∣mirable virtues of this righteous man; I find my self strongly inclined to ex∣clame, O sancte Socrates ora pro nobis! an ejaculation expresly owned even by Erasmus himself, whom Your Lordship well knows to have been free enough from Superstition: nor rashly to be condemned; nam fortasse latius se diffundit Spiritus Christi, quam nos interpretamur; & multi sunt in consortio Sanctorum, qui non sunt apud nos in catalogo.
As the actions of our Socrates in the theatre of life were a wonder of vir∣tue to even the best and wisest Philo∣sophers, so was his Exit truly glorious. But how infinitely more glorious ought we to esteem it, if we assent to the judgement of those many pious & learned men, who conceive him to have died a Martyr of the Ʋnity of God? Whether he did so, or not; I have neither place here, nor will to dispute. Leaving therefore that nice question to be decided by Your Lord∣ship after you have revolved his Apo∣logie; and in the mean time humbly deprecating your displeasure at my prolixity: I shall add only toward the excuse of it, this brief remark; that the very ashes of things soveraignly ex∣cellent are for ever august and venerable.
