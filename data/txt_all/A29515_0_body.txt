My Lord, and Gentlemen:
IN Obedience to your Order, I here present You with this Sermon; I had done it sooner but that my necessary Affairs detain'd me so long in London.
I present You with this Subject, because I could not think any other more seasonable at this time. How uneasy are we still both in our selves, and to one another, notwithstanding all that God has done for us by his Pro∣vidence, as well as our Saviour by his Religion? But it must be because we love our selves more than God, as well as better than one another. The great Example in the Text, a Man might rationally think, if but publickly read over to our Congregations, might make us more kind
and easy to one another than we are. If I have con∣tributed any thing to that purpose by this mean Discourse upon such an excellent Subject, I have contributed so much to the Security of our Church and Reformed Reli∣gion; for if we are divided against our selves, and conti∣nue so, we cannot stand. I was before I was aware antici∣pated by the Time, which made me break off abruptly; but I have added no new Sense, but expressed what I then deli∣vered more intilligibly.
May your Lordship, and you the worthy Magistrates of this great City, see Jerusalem at Peace within it self, and may you in your Stations be instrumental to it, that the present Age may honour your Persons, and Posterity your Memory, in this World, and the Felicity of Heaven may be your Reward in the World to come, is, and shall be the hearty Prayer of
My Lord, and Gentlemen,

June 17. 1689.
