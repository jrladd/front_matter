MOST Renowned Assembly, whose Vigilancy and Care for the Publick Good, all Ages have sufficiently experienced, and in whose Determination the People of England, calmly, content∣edly, and conscienciously acquiesce; tho the corruptions and perversions of ill men have frequently subverted your most Generous Designs for the Publick Good, to their own base and private Interests; among the num∣ber of which, it were heartily to be wish'd that the most Noble and Ne∣cessary Art of Physick were not pro∣ituted and perverted (by men
strictly sworn to the contrary) to the avarice, pride, and oppression of a few, who not content private∣ly to enslave and abuse men, by ex∣acting Fourscore or a Hundred Pounds, for an Admission, with∣out any Examination; but open∣ly enact By-Laws, contrary to Act of Parliament and the Cam∣mon Good of Mankind, pre∣cluding (without any respect of their Due and Legal Qualificati∣ons, and Abilities) particular men from being serviceable to the Pub∣lick; as will plainly appear to those who shall attentively examine the following Case, and Statutes. The prudent and seasonable redress of which Enormities, most Worthy Patriots, when time and opportu∣nity shall present, is humbly sub∣mitted to your Determination and Judgement.
