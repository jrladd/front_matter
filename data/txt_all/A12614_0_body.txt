MADAME
This peece in its
natiue language
was happy by
the protection
of that glorious
Princesse, and mirrour of vertuous
Ladies, the Lady CLARA EV∣GENIA

of happy memorie.
T'is now translated, and vested
with an English hew: to whose
protection, and tuition, with more
conuenience, or more confidence,
may this stranger flie, then to your
most Gracious Highnesse? For if
it bee the bookes ambition to
scorne the publicke view, vnlesse
it may hee graced with the sacred
patronage of à Dutchesse, of à
Noble, and vertuous Ladie; by
ying to the refuge of your High∣nesse
vnparrelled vertues, it shall
onely change, not loose it's mi∣stris.
MADAME, yet I most
humbly bowe; craving pardon of
your Grace that I present my ho∣mage
so veiled as in à translation,
not in à primary composition, best
suting with my duety, and your
most eminent worth; since that

your Excellencyes splendor might
well enlighten, make acute, giue
full vigour, yea and most liuely
spirit to each vulgar capacity; to
me especially whose deuotion to
your Greatnes and Goodnes well
weighed, would be found as verily,
it is, truely resigned.
Really I would haue attempted
the deliverye of some notions
wherewith aswell my zeale, as also
your Graces singular vertues haue
formerly prompted me.
But when I (let not this my
Apology, MADAME, not fin∣de
grace with your Grace) perused
this treatise (which I now dedicate
to your Excellency) made English;
and found it consonant to what
the height of my imagination
could arriue, yea and as well agree∣ing,
aptly according with your
Excellencyes example: Then was

I acquieted, made no farther
search, for that I was euen fully
appayed, Alas! yet MADAME
as confiding in your indulgency,
your conniuency.
The Author most learnedly hath
deliuered his charitable minde, in
whose worke reading and curious
notions are sweetly couched, eui∣dently
to bee seene in an appropri∣ate
Methode: yea and it is most
assuredly embellished and practi∣cally
confirmed by him, as
being fraught vvith many rare
patternes, among vvhich
MADAME were I not à trans∣lator
I would herein record, regis∣ter
your Grace, as one deseruedly.
Farther what are the particular
contents of this piece will cleerly
be shewē in the subsequēt preface,
compiled by the Author himself;

to which I referre your Excellen∣cy
wherein may be contemplated
à discourse vvhich may well and
likely proue à generall benefitt to
all Readers by your Grace.
MADAME
