HAuing of late, (right Hono∣rable) compi∣led this simple Discourse, of managing we∣pons, and dea∣ling in honorable Quarrels (which I esteeme an Introduction to Mar∣tiall  affayres) I haue thought good to dedicate the same vnto your Honor, as vnto him whose bountie most bindeth me: whose valour in∣forceth all soldiers to acknowledge you the English Achilles: whose fauouring good literature celebra∣teth your name for the students Mecenas: whose benigne potecti∣on and prouision for strangers, ma∣keth you reported off as theyr safe sanctuary. This work, I must needs confesse, is farre vnworthie your Lordships view, in regard eyther of method or substance: and being much vnperfecter than it shoulde haue beene, if I had had copie of English to haue expressed my mea∣ning as I would. But I humbly be∣seech your good Lordship to ac∣cept this Booke, howsoeuer it be, as  a new yeeres gifte proceeding from a minde most dutifully affected to∣wards you, that wisheth and pray∣eth, that your Honour may inioy many good and prosperous yeres: and is presented by him that is and will be readie euerie yere, daie, and houre to liue and die at your Lordships foot to do you ser∣uice.
