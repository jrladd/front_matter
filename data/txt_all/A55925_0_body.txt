Sir,
SEeing you would not be deny'd; I have in compliance with your Request, consi∣der'd the Letter concerning Toleration: but so, as to confine my self to what respects the proper Subject and Design of it: not med∣ling with any incidental matters, though some of that kind are liable enough to Animadver∣sion. You know I love no long work. And as short as this is, it had been shorter, if I could well have made it so. I should beg your par∣don for the backwardness I shew'd to comply with your Request, but that I fear the mean∣ness of the performance will too much justi∣fie it.
Sir, 
March 27. 1690.
