BEing aduertised by diuers of my good
friends, how fauorably it hath pleased
the Gentlemen, both of the Court and
Country, and specially the Gentlemen
of the Innes of Court, to accept of my
poore Pamphlets, entituled Blundeuiles Exercises;
yea, and that many haue earnestly studied the same,
because they plainly teach the first Principles, as well
of Geographie as of Astronomie: I thought I could
not shew my selfe any way more thankfull vnto them,
than by setting forth the Theoriques of the Planets,
vvhich I haue collected, partly out of Ptolomey, and
partly out of Purbachius, and of his Commentator
Reinholdus, also out of Copernicus, but most out of
Mestelyn, whom I haue cheefely followed, because his
method and order of writing greatly contenteth my
humor. I haue also in many things followed Maginus,
a later vvriter, vvho came not vnto my hands, before
that I had almost ended the first part of my booke,
neither should I haue had him at all, if my good friend
M. Doctor Browne, one of the ordinarie Physicians
to her Maiestie, had not gotten him for me, with which

good Doctor I haue had in times past at Norwiche
many learned conferences, and haue receiued at his
hands many good documents, whom I take to be so
vniuersally learned in all manner of good and liberall
Sciences, as any other that I know in these daies: and
besides his great learning, I know him to be very wise
and honest, which two vertues I wish to raigne in all
learned men, because they be the greatest ornaments
that belong to learning. I haue deuided this my
booke into two parts, whereof the first part treateth
of the diuers motions of the Planets; and the second
part, of their Passions; and that so plainely, and vvith
such facilitie, as I hope that euery man of a meane ca∣pacitie
may vnderstand the same. For I thought good
to collect out of the foresaid Authors no more but
that vvhich onely was meet and fit for that purpose,
praying all those that be learned, hereafter to adde to
this my booke any necessarie thing, that I through
age and vvant of cleare sight, haue negligently omit∣ted.
And so I leaue to trouble you, praying you
to take this my labour in good part, so
shall I haue iust cause to thinke
the same well bestow∣ed. Vale.
