GOOD Sir, my occasions staying me so long in London this last vacation, as that according to the bill of Certificat there died aboue 19 hundreth of the Plague in one weeke: Although I then thought it not fit to imploy that time in any serious Study, yet I was vnlling to passe it wholly ouer without some exercise of my Pen. Whereupon resor∣ting to a few odde trifles which I had penned about a yeare or two sithens, I added euery day for diuerse dayes together sundry o∣thers vnto them. And causing my man to write them out after me, in the end I found the whole thereof to arise vnto a propor∣tion of a litle Booke: which (thus written as it is) I send vnto you, as a token of my assured goodwill, being ready from time to time to expresse the same by better meanes as I shall be enabled there∣unto. And whereas in one or two places of the booke I haue made mention of outragious fees, let that light where it will: As for you, you are knowne to be a giuer of fees: But an extreame ex∣acter of fees I am perswaded in my heart you neuer were, nor e∣uer will be. And so with my best wishing vnto you, I cease: This First of Ianuarie 16.
