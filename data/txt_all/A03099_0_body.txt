Right Honorable,
IN the generall concourse of those who runne to doe your Lordshippe honour, I, (who haue tasted as freely of your former fa∣uours as the most of them) could no longer containe, but
 with Ahimaaz must runne also, though without a full er∣raund; perswading my selfe that the swift wings of sincere affection would carry me be∣yond the formost Cushi. Pleaseth it therfore your Ho∣nour to accept this first argu∣ment of my vowed duty, vtte∣red sometime at one of your places of residency, graced by the audience of one of your predecessors, but now prest for your Lordships seruice. It can adde nothing to the magnitude of your honour, no more then a
 droppe to the Ocean, but by your Lordships acceptance it may increase the honouring multitude by One. The Lord of Lords who hath begun this great worke in you, perfect the same to the glory of himselfe, the aduancement of his Church and disrespected Churchmen.
