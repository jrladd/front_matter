Christian Reader,
IT is not good weigh∣ing ones worth in such unequal bal∣lances, where the feather of opi∣nion turnes the scales. One spoke can never stand still whilest the whole wheel turnes round. The gifts and graces of Christians lay in common till envie made the first in∣closure.

Here thou mayest shew thy wisdome in spin∣ning a fine thread out of course wooll. Do not hurt him by thy malice, who would help thee in thy marriage. Who would plant a piece or Ordnance to beat down an aspen leafe, which having alwayes the palsie, will fall alone? This piece neither desires sup∣planters, nor deserves suppor∣ters. It comes forth as a pressed Souldier, not as a Vo∣lunteer, what it was in prea∣ching, it is in publishing; There is not one cubit added to its stature, to secure it from the Avenger of blood, it flyes to thy City

of refuge. Let him who sowes his paines, reap thy prayers.
