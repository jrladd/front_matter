OVr SECOND, late; now FIRST-best, future HOPE,
Whose, in remainder, we; and thou art, ours;
What should we wish thee, but that Heau'n wide ope?
Raine downe her Blessings in aboundant showres,
To make thy Parents happy; thy selfe blessed,
And we, in them, and through them, t'haue in thee
The greatest Good that euer men possessed:
Which with the Goodnesse may as lasting bee.
Long stand our Atlas; and when he shall fall,
Be thou our Hercules, hold vp our Heau'n,
Our happinesse, I meane, and help vs all:
Sit at the Helme, and keepe our Ship vp eu'n;
Then take, and Long, O long keepe at the stearne!
Meane time now grow in Goodnesse, Greatnesse, State,
All which thou needst not trauell farre to learne,
Nor needest but thine owne to imitate:
Thy wise and zealous Sire, thy vertuous Mother,
And, O that Great hart! now heau'n crownd thy brother.
Maneant afata nepotes.
