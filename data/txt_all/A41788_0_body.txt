Beloved in Christ;
AS you are expresly bound by Gospel-Rules, to do that which is right unto your Ser∣vants, and to bring up your Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; so I am very sensible, that the capacity of many well-meaning Christians is very low, to metho∣dize their Instructions in this behalf.
And having a desire to serve you in what I may; I have here presented you with some Brief Rules (from the good Word of God, which is able, through Faith and Love, to make our Chil∣dren wise to Salvation) which, by the Blessing of God, I have found to be useful in my own Fa∣mily.
Be exhorted to tender the Salvation of all that are under your care, above all other Considera∣tions, lest their Blood be required of you. Teach them the Fear of God betimes, with their Du∣ties towards their Superiours in every state of Life; for this shall be a means to preserve them from many dangerous Erros in these daies, and also adorn the Gospel of God our Saviour, to whose Grace I comit you, and remain,
