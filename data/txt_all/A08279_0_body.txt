Right Honorable;
I Am bolde
to present
vnto you,
and vnder
your Ho∣nourable
countenance,

these vntimely and green
fruits of my idle ,
which I gained in (and
without  of)
his Maiesties seruice,
wherein I haue been em∣ployed▪
fearing yet lest
my forwardnesse in at∣tempting,
and especially
in publishing a matter so
farre aboue the course of
my ordinarie calling,
should deseruedly pur∣chase
vnto my selfe con∣digne
reproofe. For that
it may be right well obie∣cted,
That it had better
besitted mee to haue re∣tained
my selfe within
the  of, and to haue

(with more diligence)
imploied myself vnto, the
purport of my ordinarie
Commission. And so I
doe acknowledge, had I
beene negligent in per∣forming
the last. And I
acknowledge it commen∣dable,
and a sufficient dis¦charge
for a man of what∣soeuer
profession, sincere∣ly
to performe the same,
without thrusting his sic∣kle
into another mans
haruest▪ But no man is
ignorant that there is a
two-fold calling in euerie
Christian; a corporal and
a spirituall: and they dif∣fer
in themselues as dark∣nesse

& light: the effects
of the first are visible, of
the second hidden, as
touching the internal and
mentall working; the
outward actions cōmon
to both. But our Saui∣our
faith, Man liueth not
by bread, that is, by cor∣porall
meanes onely, but
by a kind of spirituall no¦rishment.
For the life
that dependeth vpon the
creatures, is alike commō
to men and beasts: The
spirituall life onely pro∣per
to the children of
God; who yet partake of
the corporall bread in no
other outward manner

then doe they that know
not God. Christ had meat
to eate that his Disciples
knew not of; so haue
Gods children a nourish∣ment
that carnall men
know not of, and some o∣ther
labors and endeuors
wherof the world taketh
little or no knowledge.
The outward mysterie,
function, or calling, doth
neither discouer, nor can
they hinder this heauen∣ly
food, be their calling
neuer so super-eminent:
neither pleasure, nor pro∣fite,
nor wearinesse of bo∣die,
can hinder or preuent
the holy meditations of

well affected spirit. Car∣nall
men feed onely vpon
the seeming good they en∣ioy
in this life: Pleasure
and Profit; al their ende∣uours
tend to these, or to
one of them. They know
no better, and therefore
seek these as best & prin∣cipall
. And
what euery man affect∣eth
most is his summum
borum. But they onely
are happy, of what ranke
soeuer, who haue learned
to obserue, and do truely
follow the counsaile of
the Apostle, Not to re¦pose

too much confidence in
worldly meanes: for, Bodily
exercise (which includeth
all carnall appetite) profi∣teth
little, but Godlinesse is
profitable to all things, ha∣uing
the promise of this
life, and of that which is to
come. Godinesse consist∣eth
of spirituall exercise,
not altogether in out∣ward
labour: though the
second bee sanctified by
the first; and without the
first there is no blessing
promised to the second
No vocation, function,
office, place, exercise, or
endeuour in Church or
Common-weale can truely

prosper in the meere car∣nall
man: 
may seeme to be with
glorie, and continue a
while in seeming grace, it
neuer endeth but with
griefe. The cōsideration
whereof moued mee to a
more serious meditation,
how much it concerned
my selfe and other men
to intermix with my cor∣porall,
some spirituall ∣ercise.
At length ment
meditation brake into a∣ctual
inuocation on God,
to sanctifie my labors, to
moderate my desires of
carnall things, to order
my will, to season mine

affections, and to blesse
mine endeuors: & to this
end I was bolde to bor∣row
some oportunities of
my other employments;
which I recompenced
with the more serious di¦ligence,
when occasion
required my retire vnto
mine enioyned seruices.
And hauing thus rudely
heaped together stubble
and straw for the building
vp of mine owne medita∣tiōs,
touching the sweet∣nesse
& necessitie of prai¦er,
for mine owne priuat
comfort: I imparted the
same to some of my lear∣ned
and religious friends,

by whom I was encoura∣ged
to recommend it to
the publique; which I
haue done vnder the title
of  Load-starre to spiri∣tuall
life, importing an ef∣fectuall
motiue to praier,
and aduentured it vnder
your Honourable fauour
to the view of all that
loue that spirituall exer∣cise,
humbly entreating
pardon for my boldnes;
which if I obtaine, I hold
me richly rewarded.
At my house at Henen this 24. of Iune 1614.
