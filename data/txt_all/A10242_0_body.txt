Most gracious Soueraigne,
IT might iustly bee cen∣sured as an intolerable rashnesse in your vnwor∣thy Subiect, that hee be∣ing so lately pardoned for his great audaciousnesse, should

yet againe presume in the same kind; had he not read charactered in your very countenance, Quanto maior tanto melior,August. Quanto melior tanto mitior, that your Sonereigne Greatnesse made way for your boun∣teous Goodnesse, and boundles Gen∣tlenes; and beene confident that it would graciously consider, that albeit it were an vnwonted presumption for so meane a Subiect to aduance in so short a space, to so high a Ma∣iestie, two seuerall paper-presents (as vnworthy to be read, as euery way vn∣readie) yet the rare presence of so great an Highnesse as the eldest eye hath not seene in these parts of your Dominions, (which are not so farre distant from your Royall Mansions, as their people are neerely linked to

the seruice of your Maiestie) toge∣ther with that great and generall emulation of your loyall Subiects, stri∣uing to doe your Maiestie some accep∣table seruice in this vnusuall Pro∣gresse, might be admitted to mediate vnto your Royall fauour for a renew∣ing of the former Pardon, and giuing acceptance to the same person, who with as much loyall respect as former∣ly, and with the same prostrate humi∣litie deuoteth this his second seruice to your sacred selfe, in your Princely re∣turne from the period of your long progresse; humbly desiring the Lord of Hoasts to prosper your Maiesties Royall Marriage, Leagues, Na∣uies, Armies and Iourneyes, that they may tend to the Glorie of the Al∣mightie, the terror of your Enemies,

the assurance of your safetie, the suc∣cours of your deiected Sister, and the comfort of your deuoted Subiects, a∣mongst whom, euen in that long Roll extended in the Westerne Chart, there shall euer be found while life shall remayne,
