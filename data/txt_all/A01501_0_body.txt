HAuing no leysure (most noble Lady) but such as euermore is
traueld with th'afflictions of the minde, then which the world affoords no
greater misery, it may bee wondred at by some, how I durst vndertake a
mat∣ter of this moment: which both re∣quireth cunning, rest and oportunity; but
chiefely, that I would attempt the dedication of so rough vnpollished a
worke, to the suruey of your so worthy selfe.
But beeing well instructed in your noble and heroick
dispositions, and perfectly assur'd of your honourable fa∣uours past,
(though neyther making needles glozes of the one, nor spoyling paper with the
others Pharisaical embro∣derie,) I haue presum'd vpon your true conceit and
enter∣tainement of these small endeuours, that thus I purposed to make
known, my memory of you and them to be immortall.
A fitter present for a Patronesse so well accomplished, I
could not finde, then this faire president of honour, mag∣nanimitie,
and loue. VVherein, what grace that excellent GARNIER hath
lost by my defaulte, I shall beseech your Honour to repaire, with the regarde
of those so bitter times, and priuie broken passions that I endured in
the wri∣ting it.
And so vouchsafing but the possing of a VVinters weeke with
desolate Cornelia, I will assure your Ladiship my next Sommers
better trauell, with the Tragedy of Portia. And euer spend one howre
of the day in some kind seruice to your Honour, and another of the night in
wishing you all happines. Perpetually thus deuoting my poore selfe
