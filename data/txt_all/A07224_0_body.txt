RIght Honorable, as Aeneas, in his most distressed e∣state, sought succour of Queene Dido; So doth reason, in her more than halfe exiled condition implore your Honors as∣sistance. If there be cha∣ritable
duetie to defend the Jnnocent from op∣pression, there is no lesse, to ayde Reason against the deprauers of her sin∣ceritie, and obscurers of her worthinesse. Ʋnder God, our most gratious Queene, Defendresse of the Faith; vnder them both, you are vphold∣ers of Reasons Monar∣chie.

To your religious, ho∣nourable, and vertuous protectiōs therfore haue J aduentured to present her Dignitie, knowing you regard her excellen∣cie no lesse, thogh it want glorious ornamēts, than Darius did the friend∣ship of Zopirus, in his mangled and miserable seeming disaster. Pa∣tronize, J beseech you,
his labour, and pardon his boldenesse, that most humbly praieth continu∣ance and increase of ho∣nour and happinesse to your Lordship.
