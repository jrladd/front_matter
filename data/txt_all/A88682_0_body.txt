May it please your Honour,
MAny men (I doubt not) may be so pitiful as to blush for my Impudence, when I shall ap∣pear in England like a wild Indian; others per∣haps may hope I have so much modesty left as to frame excuses for my self, either by laying the blame on the Importunity of Friends, (the usual Refuge of Scriblers) which has exposed my weakness to publick view; or on the want of a Wardrobe, (a Library) which should have furnish'd me with a decent Dress: Though these pretences might be useful to me, yet since Truth is not uncomely, when it appears in the
same manner, I shall not seek Protection for my Cre∣dit from such Fig-leaves, whilst your Honour gives me better Security: Under this assurance I am bold to vindicate my Obedience to your Honours pleasure, (and the joynt desires of other Gentlemen my Candid Auditors) which with me has the force of an Invio∣lable Law: Nay I should have been guilty of great Injustice, in omitting any opportunity of publishing to the World, how great a Patron of the Orthodox Religion we have in Jamaica; upon which account, I may hope for a more favourable Censure of my own weakness. You need not (Sir) fear my running into a Flattering Panegyrick, Tantum absit à specie, quantum abest à necessitate; but Gratitude ob∣liges me to acquaint my Country-men how I bless Providence, which by the Noble, Learned, and Good Lord Bishop of London, introduced me into the Free Service of Those who in many respects, are alike qualified; To him I owe the use of the old Stratagem, to look for the Rising Sun in the West, where with pleasure of mind (which is an Empire) I view the Rays of Majesty by Reflection; in due Execution of Laws; in Decency and Order, in Ec∣clesiastical, Civil, and Military affairs; Encourage∣ment of Trade; mutual love amongst Loyal Subjects, and all that constitutes a Happy Government: so that no one, who is not an Enemy to himself, can
think a warm Climate to be out of God's blessing. This Harmony has made you devise Liberal things, being more powerful and attractive, than Amphion's Harp in raising these Noble Walls, whilst your Honours vigilant Eye (like Boaz over the Reapers) has made the Workmens Labour a pleasure.
The ensuing Discourse upon our entrance into God's Service herein, I hope cannot be misconstrued, as a doubting, or anticipating of my Lord of Lon∣don's kindness, which he has now conferred on the Place, by granting a Publick and Solemn Dedica∣tion, as the first Blessing and Honour of that na∣ture, which the English ever enjoyed in these parts. And that we may never want the Influence of his Favour, at so great a distance, I assure my self your Honour will be always ready to establish Ecclesiasti∣cal Discipline, so far as may be, for the suppressing of Vice, which is a truer Object of Fortitude, then some of our Neighbours who flee when no man pur∣sueth. Sir, I know Righteousness creates the bold∣ness of a Lion, and will make you both an Ornament and Safeguard to this Place, in opposing the Rude∣ness of such as dare bark, or hiss, at any thing which is Divine: Your Authority will drive Antiochus's Beasts not only from the Sanctuary, but the very Doors of it; and your Sword in some sort represent
the Flaming Cherubs, in guarding, but not keeping men from, Religion, which is the Tree of Life: In the Fruits whereof (as they contain present and fu∣ture blessings) that your Honour and Family, may have an ample share, is the hearty Prayer of,

Port-Royal in Jamaica, Jan. 28.1680/1.
