May it please your Grace,
THat little Presents have been acceptable to mighty Princes, is their usual Apology, who draw those precedents into examples; but it cannot be mine, in consecrating this small Tract to Your Excellencies hands: They pre∣sented their Governors with what was their own, I offer to your Grace, not what is mine, but Yours: You, as his Majesties Vicegerent, are appointed to defend the faith, and under him and our Saviour, are the chief Officer, both over the Civil and Ecclesiastical affairs of this Kingdom. This Discourse concerns the faith in its visible profession, and the order settled by Christ, for the Government of his Church; and therefore it is yours by those Titles. The weak∣ness of the stile, and manifold imperfections of the Com∣poser, would deter me from returning you what is Yours, in such a ragged dress, and by such an unknown hand;
 were not I verily perswaded, that as his Sacred Majestie is Divinely chosen, like another Zerubbabel, to raise a ruined Temple, so Your Excellency is one of the most eminent of the Subordinate Rulers, to carry on that glorious work; wherein as well poor Labourers must be employed to remove the rubbish, and clear the foundation, as Master-workmen, to rear and compleat the Fabrick. Il∣lustrious Sir, I humbly beg my admission into the Roll of those Gibeonites: Industry and due observance of my Su∣periors directions, are my onely commendatory Letters; if their certificate may procure me the office. I wil oblige my self to what conformity they enjoyn me in my work. But where∣fore this? Behold I see the Head-stone already brought forth with shouting, and hear the Inhabitants of these se∣veral Kingdoms from every quarter, crying, Grace, grace unto it. Now God Almighty bless our Zerubbabel, strengthen his hands, level all Mountains before him, make him the blessed finisher of what he hath happily begun, give him and his Kingdoms peace out of this Temple, and cause its glory to exceed the glory of the former; and may your Grace live long, and long to see it; and abundantly share in the comforts of it: May you no minute of your life be unassured of your indearment to God, the King, the Church and Kingdom. Let the Everlasting eyes be always over you, to direct; and let the Everlasting arms be always under you, to uphold and protect you in all your ways: And when full of days, full of honors, full of all joy and peace in believing, you shall be gathered to your Fa∣thers, may you be translated, and for ever fixed as a Star of the greatest magnitude, transcendently differing from others in glory. This the God of all blessings effectually grant, as is most affectionately implored by, My Lord,
