Sir,
IT hath been a lauda∣ble Custome with Persons of emient degree to descend to honour their Sonnes with directing Books unto them; he reciprocation of which af∣ectionate Complement is a duty well-becomming a Son; moved (therefore) with a certaine Filiall Decency I made choice to dedi∣ate this Book unto you in regard he Argument of it is Provinciall o Physick, wherein your experi∣nce hath crowned your Professi∣on,

having ever been Fortunatus in Praxi. You shall find in it that which I use to call the Clock-work of the Head, or the Springs and inward Contrivance of Instru∣ments of all our outward motions, which give motion and regulate the Dyall of the Affections, which Nature hath placed in the Face of Man; Being a New light, and the first Irradiation which ever appea∣red through the Dissections of a Corporeall Phylosophy. Could the Times have afforded it, it had come to your hands illustrated with the ornamentall Demonstra∣tions of many Figures prepared for it; but indeed the Stationers cautionary prudence met with an indisposition in me; for I thought that in such new and unexpected matters too great a splendor might possibly have dazled. I confesse I have met with little encourage∣ment

in this Designe, for all the Physicians and Anatomists that I have hinted it unto have held it scarce fecible, Doctor Wright Ju∣nior onely excepted, with whom having interchangeably communicated Intellectuall Af∣faires, He shewing me the hint of his grand undertaking, which was Anatomia Comparata, that great Defect in Anatomy noted by my L. Bacon in his Book De Augmentis Scientiarum, in returne whereof I having first told him of an At∣chievement of mine in this Art, which I called Vox Corporis, or the Moral Anatomy of the Body; I ac∣quainted him also with this Essay, whose apprehension I found so well possessed with the gallantry (as he was pleased to speak) and the possibility thereof, that he promised me (to testifie his appro∣bation,) he would commend it in

his first publique Lecture of Ana∣tomy in the College; a day much expected by those who had took notice of the most eminent and Divine Impulsions of his Anato∣mique Genius. But prevented by his much lamented Death, what entertainment this Essay shall meet with among the Sect of Cor∣poreal Philosophers; (having bin so infortunately deprived of the advantage of such a Recommen∣dation,) must be left to the Fate of Books. However, I hope it shall find acceptance with you, and be received as an evidence of the proofe of that Education you be∣stowed on me, and of my Duty.
