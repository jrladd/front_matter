My Lord,
THE mean Opinion I had of this slight Composition when I preach'd it, re∣mov'd me far from any Apprehensions of an Order to print it; but Your Lordship, and the Honourable Court, to whom it is habitual to over-value all the Performances of Your Servants, having required the prin∣ting of it; I present you with an honest, well∣meant Sermon, and of which I should despise from any Man the Complement of a higher Character. The Relation I stand in to Your Lordship, might put me under a temptation
of taking this Opportunity to mention some∣thing that might look like Flattery; but Your Lordship's Virtue surmounts the Possibility of it. To say that the Memorable Lord Mayor of Eighty two, Sir JOHN MOORE, is a Person most exemplarily Devout and Pious, Wise and Prudent, Obliging and Af∣fable, Valiant and Loyal, were no more than for which I should have all the honest World my Vouchers. May God Almighty bless Your Lordship, and grant that this City may al∣ways have such a Magistrate to fill the Chair. I am,
My Lord,
