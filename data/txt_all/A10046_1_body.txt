Mr LEECH.
TO the learned, wise, and ingenious Academicks flowrishing in the renowned Vniversitie of Ox∣ford.
ANSVVER.
SIR, your booke sent from Ar∣ras, as a peece of worke of di∣vers colours, is at length survey∣ed and reviewed, to see whether it be worth the answering. The opinion of many was, as that of Tully cōcerningAct. 4. in verrem. Heius, that you had rather mard the cause then bettred it, and therefore your tract vnworthy to bee answered. But my minde was otherwise, that the cause mard you, and therefore you and it to be view∣ed, to be pittied, to be answered. In which succeeding discourse would I could deale with you as S.Ierome. Tom. 2. Ierome desired to deale with Origen, that our Countrymen shoulde know your best things, and bee ignorant of your worst. For my witnesses be in heaven, & in my owne bosome, that no motion of envy, gaine, glorie, ir∣regular
 provocation or popular ostentation, haue drawne me to this: but the all guiding spirit of God, by the honourable motion of some, and comfortable en∣couragement of others. And therefore I doe refraine all disparagements, and personall aspersions against you: wishing you had done so, against those manie worthy Doctors of our Vniversity. An act, which I know you once disliked in that baaling PriestHis booke entituled de Triplici homi∣nis officio & his epistle to the Vniversitie. Weston, who as if he had beene one of Psilli who only fed on Poyson, or the voice of a man in the mouth of a De∣vill,Esay 36.4. or Rabshekah sent out of Hell to blaspheme God, did vilifie all the Bewclarks of learning aliue & dead, Doctors and governors of our Academy. But let his branded character remaine vpon him and his memory. Cams curse, and Cains marke,Gen. 4.12. vagus & pro∣fugus in terris. The front of your Epistle sheweth at first that you thinke otherwise of vs thē he doth; see∣ing that you stile our students the learned, wise, ingeni∣ous Academicks flowrishing, and our Vniversity the re∣nowned Oxford: we shall see how you proceede.
Mr LEECH.
Experience doth well approue Saint Bernards saying; Efficacior lingua, quàm litera: the tōgue is of greater ef∣ficacie, then the pen. And therefore I suffer no little disad∣vantage, in that I must now speake vnto you in a silent letter, & pleade my cause by a mute advocate of my mind.
ANSVVER.
It is true, efficacior lingua, quàm litera; but yet, meli∣or
 anima, quàm lingua. If your pen expresse not what your tongue is able fullie, I would your hart woulde conceiue that which your tongue may speake truly, that as some thinke there bee certaine strings that passe from the hart to the tongue, so there might bee a concatenatiō that what your hart thinketh, & your tongue speaketh, and your pen writeth, may so agree, that they may be all to the glorie of God, the instru∣cting of others, and saving of your owne soule. For if your tongue could thunder, asAul. Gell. lib. 17-c. 17. Aristophanes spake of Pericles; or you had a tongue like a trumpet, asHier. adver. Ruffin. tom. 2. fol. 221. Hie∣rome saith Hilary had; or, as Saint1. Cor. 13. Paule observeth, the tongue of men, or Angels, and had not Charitie: it were but vayne sounding, tickling, tinckling. The tongue not powerfull without charity, and charity not fruitfull with∣out verity. S. Austin noted that all marvailed at Tul∣lies tongue, but not at his invention; and at Aristotles invention, but not his tongue: I know not that ever you were admired for either: But remember to vse the talent given in both, as you ought; & thinke not, you suffer disadvantage in that you speake in a silent letter: I would it were not silent both for proofe and profit, and that your mute advocate were not muti∣nous.
Mr. LEECH.
But since I write vnto thē, who are not strangers in my busines, but as well eie witnesses of the wrongs, which I haue endured, as eare witnesses of the doctrine which I preached among you; my vndoubted hope is, that your harts will be touched with some compassion either toward me, vnworthyly entreated by a faction (for I will not impute
 the crime of a few vnto all) or towards your selues, whome this particular doth very highly import, in respect of your learning, honor, and estimation.
ANRVVERE.
You write to those that are strangers, to your do∣ctrine, not to your person; or strāgers, not to the hea∣ring, but approuing your opinion: strangers wee are all to any wrongs done to you, not to the wrongs offered by you. And therefore thinke you not to touch the hartstrings of our students with a dittie of compas∣sion, as if you were (as you say) wrongfully and vn∣worthily entreated by a faction. Compassion every honest hart will afford you for being misled, rather then misused.Lib. 1. de Controver. ad Cler. c. 31. St Bernard distinguisheth of pacidicos and pacificos, those that in word speake of peace, but indeed make ready to battaile. So may I concerning your request for compassion, and yet even in that your petition, you breake into a furious passion, to accuse those reverend learned Doctors, who censu∣red you, as if they had beene a faction. I will not be nice to climbe ouer those seeming difficulties that lie in my way: and yet without enlarging the limits of your speech, as all your assertions like so many dis∣eases attend vpon the ague of error; so this among the rest, wherein you censure those that iudicially censu∣red you, to be a factiō. If any afforded your pen main∣tenance, or your sermons countenance by clancular approbation, contrary to the iudgement and truth deliuered by the learned Vicechancelor, and his worthy asistants; they were the faction, not these. It is not a
 factious position which is generally maintained by the happy and gratious Church of England, groun∣ded vpō irrefragable places of holy Scriptures, taught by many impregnable places of ancient Fathers, yea your grand Iury of Fathers called into the Star cham∣ber of iudgement by a iudicious learned & religiousDoctor Benefield. Divine, now all witnessing against you. Were you vnworthily intreated when loue allured you, and au∣thority sollicited you to take better councell? Were you silenced, or imprisoned, or censured at all, til that engastred impostume brake out, in your last sermon, all dayly expecting a much more earnest course a∣gainst you, the discommoning rather of you, thē the losse of your commons? And whereas you desire vs to be moued with compassion toward our selues; we may vse the words of our Saviour, weepe not for me but weepe for your selues, so compassionate not vs, but your selfe. And for my selfe among many others I shall ever afford you that harty pitty, nonBernard. oris atta∣ctu, sed mentis affectu, as to say to you as the1. Kings. 13.30. old Pro∣phet did of the seduced Prophet, alas for thee my bro¦ther.
Mr LEECH.
For as the iniury, which God, and his truth haue sustai∣ned in my person, is now made knowne not only vnto our nation, but the fame thereof beginneth to spread it selfe abroad in these forraine parts, so it concerneth you (my lo∣uing fathers and brethren) to wipe away that disgrace, and blemish from your mother, and your selues, which some of har vnnaturall children would both staine her with, and
 deriue vpon you; endeavoring to obscure their private folly in the publike shame. Which protection I will neuer afford vnto them, vnlesse they can obtaine it by your own consent.
ANSVVER.
Was the quiet and long forborne conventing of you, iudiciall hearing, learned opposing, religious coun∣selling, calme censuring of you such an iniurie vnto God, and his truth, that not only the whole Vniver∣sity, but also the whole nation, and, quae regio in terris vestri nō plena furoris? almost al the world taketh no∣tice (as you say) for the FAME thereof beginneth to spread it selfe in those forraine parts. A good thing the more generally it is spread, the better: but of the contrary ever the contrary falleth out.Plut. Plutarch tel∣leth of a plague that began in Aethiopia, thence filled Athens, killed Pericles, vexed Thucydides, and spread it selfe far. It should seeme by the spreading of that re∣port of what you endured, that it was some contagi∣ous stuffe that did so expatiate. But what if it doe so, a∣mong those, who haue banished truth as a stranger, & chained vp Religion as a prisoner? To preach a doctrine twise before forbidden you, was seditious; to preach a doctrine no way to be warrāted, was erroneous; that doctrine so soone to spread it selfe, through so great a nation, so many forraine parts, it was dangerous. Good things are not so fertile. The great eie of hea∣uen, and the God which must iudge you, and that cō∣science which must accuse you, doe all witnesse how iniuriously you dealt here with your gouernors in
 disobeying them, and now howe vniustly abroad in traducing them. Durst any in those forraine parts, so peremptorilie, and presumptuously, publiquely haue maintained any point of the contrary religion, but hee had beene apprehended and presently cast into the iawes of that monster the Spanish inquisitiō: your vsage was otherwise, you were warned by some, counsel∣led by others, pitied by al, not publiquely convented, not commanded to recante, not imprisoned, not ex∣pelled, only forbidden to preach because you offen∣ded by preaching, & put out of commons for a while the common punishment for any collegiate offence; & the fame of this so far to spread, it cannot profit you any way nor preiudice the chariots of our Israell the gover∣nours of our Vniversitie. Only remember whatDe fam. & spe. diat. 117. Pe∣trarch admonisheth in such a case: Multi famam se mereri sperant, dum infamiam mereantur. Let not this fame bee your infamy, nor let these blemishes and disgraces which you impute to our Academicall mo∣ther, or the vnnaturalnesse you deeme to bee in her children, be found all of them in you; feare your owne private folly, flie your owne publike shame (I vse your owne words.) To make a shew of nakednesse where there is none, is worthily cōdemned: but to spit such words of blemish, disgrace, folly and shame in the face of such reverend Fathers, O remember it is accursed. I haue gathered vp all your burdens, bonds pressures, complaints; summe them vp all, they be all nothing.
Mr LEECH.
Wherefore, out of my affectionate zeale vnto your cre∣dit
 I doe both humbly desire, and earnestly require you to avert this infamy from your noble mother, and to free her from the imputation, which, otherwise, you draw vpon her, as being either a Patronesse of falshood, or fearefull to de∣fend the truth: which folly in the first, or pussillanimity in the second, is a great staine to men of your quality and place.
ANSVVER.
It wasDiog. Laert. in vita Diog. Diogenes speech; Oportet sapientiam ab insi∣pientibus feriri: but yet g wisdome shalbe iustified by her children,Mat. 11.19. and the blowe given by you in the pulpit which you think shal leaue a scarr in the face of Ox∣ford, is easily remoued. For no sooner were you re∣moued hence, but the infamy was averted & the aire purged from receauing the contagion of any such amphibious amphibologious heresie. For your zealous affection, when you are truely zealous towards God, you will be truly affectionate towards his servants; let not the fume of envy, and fome of vanity, turne holy∣nes into hypocrisie, zeale into folly, and assure your self as long as this Metropolis of learning shal stād, which I hope shalbe as long as the sunne and moone endure, shee will bee so far from being either Patronesse of falshood, or feareful to defend the truth, that she wil ever haue, many strong men armed in the studies of Divinity, furnished with the skill of tongues, labori∣ously exercised in the sacred Scriptures, studiously cō¦versant in the Fathers, wel acquainted with the histo∣ry of times, who like the valiant men of Israell, that guardedCan. 3.7.8. Salomons bed, will be euer provided to en∣combat
 any Iesuiticall Philistin that revileth the host of the Lord of hosts. It lacked not such worthies in the former time, such was ourScot. 4. see Dist. 18. Scotus resisting the real presence, Anno 1290. OurWolsius lect memor. Tom 1. Occam confuting the Popes authority, Anno 1330. OurBalaeus cōt. 6. cap. 1. Wickliffe writing against most points of Popery about the yeare 1360. besides those Roses of the field, and Lyllies of the vallies, asAug. Augustin called Martyres,Cranmer-Ridly. Latimer. those reverend and ho∣ly Bishops, whoe sealed our religion in Oxford with their owne bloud. And it lacketh not such worthies in these later times, such as are those reverēd Doctors, who openly in Schooles; & those learned preachers, who haue publikely and frequently in disputations, and sermons, worthily confuted vnsound and vnsauo∣ry positions, & amōg the rest this of yours. For many haue descended so low as to take knowledge of this your vnsound receit or conceit, all which haue vali∣antly discharged peales of ordinance against it, main∣taining the contrary, irrefragably in Diuinity schooles in disputations, in St. Maries and Christ-Church most frequently in sermons, besides letters of condemna∣tion against you from the right Reverend Father our Chancelor to the Convocation,My L. Grace of Canterbu∣ry in his let∣ters to the Convocation Ano 1608. speeches in our pub∣like Act, by the Vicechancelor, Proctors, Respondents, and almost al that can write, or speake among vs, wil wit∣nesse how poore your hope of allowance is here. Nothing at this time and ever since the publishing of your booke being more commonly gratefull to the hearers, gracefull to the speakers, thē the dayly cō∣dēning & confuting of this your extravagāt Paradox; so that for folly or pusillanimity, it is not harboured in the breast of our Vniversitie.

Mr LEECH.
For you stile your Vniversity the Fountaine, and Eie of the kingdome. And you say not vnfitly; forasmuch as the Doctrine there taught doth streame forth into al parts of our nation: and all men come vnto you to receiue in∣formation of their vnderstandings, by your Academicall instruction. In which respect you stand deeply obliged vn∣to God, and men (as you haue care of his glory, and their benefit) to vindicate the truth from oppression, and to re∣deeme hir out of captiuitie into freedome, that her lustre may not be darkned, where so great a pretense is made of the gospells light.
ANSVVER.
Ex ore tuo? Shall I condemne you out of your own mouth? The story inGell. Noct. Attic. lib. 18. cap. 3. Gellius tells you that when a bad man had set downe a good cause, the people liking the speech, but disliking the man, caused it to bee pro∣nounced by one of better respect. I will not deale so with you, but I will take even your owne testimony. It is the fountaine of our kingdome, and her streames bee cleere as Christall, sweet as the waters of Bethell, and flu∣ent as Iordan that maketh glad the City of God. It is the eie of the land, wherein neither the moat of schis∣me, nor beame of superstition (I hope) shall euer take place, to darkē the sight of this glorious light. Naioth in Samuels time, Iericho in Elizeus time, Ierusalē in Io∣sias time, Corinth in S. Paules time, all schooles of the Prophets, and Vniversities; never more illustrious for Colledges and students then this eie of our land, hart of our body, fort of our country, glory of our king∣dome. Neither need you ever doubt, but that there be many here, able, willing, pressing, sweating, & stri∣ving
 to vindicate the truth from oppression, and re∣deeme her out of captivitie; yea to lead captivity cap∣tiue, and to seek to bring redemption vnto those, that sit in darknes, and to reduce them into the glorious liberties of the sonnes of God: here being no pretense of the light of Christs Gospell, but the reall presence of his spirit.
Mr LEECH.
Which iust kindnesse if I may not procure at your hāds, yet the truth shall not be impaired thereby: nor will I be a∣ny whit discomfited, otherwise then in a sorrowfull com∣miseration of your estate. For my resolution is firmely made within mine owne heart, to spare no travell, that I may purchase condigne approbation of my cause, from all the Vniversities in Europe: if iustice may not bee there done, where Gods truth, and I (meerely for her sake) haue received such iniurie, as seemeth almost incredible vnto strangers, who do not yet sufficiently vnderstand the cour∣ses of D. King, and of other Calvinists; the assistāts of his spleneticall proceedings.
ANSVVER.
The law holdes it iniustice to afforde kindnesse to an adversarie, and so you are helde, if not to our persons yet to our positions: truth by you hath beene impug∣ned, not impaired; for Rome and hell cannot suppresse it: oppugnari potest, non expugnari, saith the Oratour. For your cōmiserating of vs, it is impossible you shoulde afford vs such kindnes, being so vnkinde vnto your selfe. Quid miserius misero non miserante seipsum, saithAug. Au∣gustin?
 Charitie must begin with it selfe. Begin then to pitty your selfe, & pray for your selfe, that though you be led into temptation yet the tempter proue not victor. Your resolution to travell all the Vniversities of Europe wilbe verie laborious, and yet very idle, for the Vniversitie of Leaden may satisfie you well e∣nough: and it wilbe verie laborious, to carrie such a masse of flesh about you, and so mountainous a heape of torments of conscience, if you haue any conscience, to remember that in a discontented humor you haue for∣saken your God, religion, nation, vocation, the truth in which you were baptized, by which you were bred, and vnto which you agreed, subscribed, vowed your whole life and labour. But if you determine to be so resolute a pilgrime as to travell al Vniversities in Eu∣rope, assure your selfe it wilbe as idle as laborious, for it wilbe to no purpose. And if for idleMat. 12.37. words, much more for idle actions, answere must be made. Yet in your travell, thinke not to darken the sun as you may a Candle, offer not to traduce him, whom manners & oathes of the Vniversitie & Colledge where you li∣ved, haue obliged you to honour; Thinke not to sub∣iect the honourable reputation of your thrice wor∣thy Deane, our most worthy Vicechancelor, by anie slanderous, scandalous speeches nor let anie Phrene∣ticall humor in you, iudge his wise proceedings to re∣lish of anie spleneticall savour. Let neither nature through custome, nor bitternesse through discontent force you, so far to forget the dutie you owe to thisBasil.  this most worthy servant of God, seeing they that liue with him, loue him, all that know him re∣verence him, they that heare of him admire him; Qui
 primas nō habuisti sapientiae, secundas habeas partes mo∣destiae, saithAustin. Re∣tract. Austin in his retractations. I would you would so retract. It is not credible that you received (as you saie) incredible iniurie in the lawfull procee∣dings against you. The Vniversitie censured you, not imprisoned you. The Colledge for a time discōmo∣ned you, not expelled you. This small punishmēt no banishment, your Cōplaint is the same withIn orat. pro sexto Roscio. Fim∣bria in Tully, quod non totum tèlum in corpore recepisset, you received great iniurie, because you were not suf∣fred to doe great iniury. But be not deceiued, God is not mocked, enter into a serious and religious cogi∣tation, whether in this course that you are, you need not feare the true description of malecontented A∣postats, I would you were not sutable to them, as they be liuely deciphered both by S.2. Pet. 2. Peter and S.Iude. 13. Iude, to be presumptuous, standing in their owne opinion, wan∣dring starres, raging waues of the Sea foaming out their owne shame, and, speaking evill of them which are in au∣thority, which a man that maintaineth your third Counsaile of obedience should not doe. The scorn∣full aspertion you cast vpon vs by the byname of Cal∣vinists we neither reiect nor receiue. Reverend, lear∣ned, holy Calvin, was the greatest glory of the French Church that ever was, since he was,Hooker praef. to his Church Politic. as a famous writer witnesseth. And though our Religion seeke neither an∣tiquitie nor authoritie from him, nor we denominati∣on or confirmation by him, because as the Apostle speak∣eth we reioice not in men: yet wee reverence him, be∣cause as the same Apostle in the same verse conclu∣deth,1. Cor. 3.22.23. whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, al are ours we Christs, and Christ Gods.

Mr LEECH.
Finally (my brethren) with my honest petition, and necessarie counsaile, I ioine my harty praiers (and teares with them) that it would please the author of all goodnes, and the God of all truth, to powre the abundant riches of his grace into your soules, that your vnderstandings may be fully enlightned with his truth, and that your wills may be made conformable therevnto in your profession of the holy Catholike faith. For which as I now suffer the want of my natiue country, so, in defence thereof, I shall be ready to yeeld vp my life, when it shall please my gratious Lord to call mee vnto that honour: whereof I am vnworthy.
Your devoted brother in Christ. Humfrey Leech.
ANSVVER.
The Epistolary conclusion with a petition, and coū∣saile, we should receiue more willingly, if your petiti∣on were more honest, and your counsell more Evange∣licall. Your prayers we returne tenfold into your bo∣some, beseeching the Lord that it may please him, to free your vnderstanding by truth, abAlbert. in Comp. The∣ol. lib. 5. ignorantia veri;
 to rectifie your will by good, a concupiscentia mali; and to purge your whole soule by grace, ab impotentia boni: that your will maie be subiect to his will, your life to his seruice, not his service to your will; and so you may be reduced to the true Apostolique, Catholique faith: that as you complaine you suffer the want, though the wanton want of your natiue Country; so you may not endure the want of heavenly Ierusalem, your spi∣rituall Country: that when you are to appeare at the fatall, and finall iudgement among the great and smale, when the muffling of conscience shall bee discovered, the worme of conscience be not your portiō. And that in your pilgrimage here, you may rather wash your garments in the blood of the Lambe, then in your owne blood: so by the teares of a sinner, blood of a Sauiour, & prayers of his Saints on earth, you may bee brought againe to this militant Church, & in the better world receiue a permanent state in his triumphant Church.
