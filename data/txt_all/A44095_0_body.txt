My Lord,
HOW great a Stranger so∣ever I may be to Your Lordship, I am not much
at a loss for an Apologie for the Boldness of devoting this mean Present to Your Honourable Name. The inexpressible Favours I had the Honour to receive from Your Noble Father, have justly entitled Your Lordship to the best of my Performances: 'Twas His generous Charity made me what I am; and what the Product of that may be, is and shall be a due Tri∣bute to Your Lordship. His Ver∣tues Your Lordship inherits; and nothing can more fully compleat the utmost Aim of my Ambition, than an Opportunity of shewing my self Grateful to Your Lord∣ships
Father's Immortal Memory, and of manifesting my self (in what Circumstance soever)
My Lord,
