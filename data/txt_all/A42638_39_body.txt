May it please your Sacred Majesty:
MY place of Master of the Ceremonies (which the King your Royal Father of blessed me∣mory, confirmed un∣to



me during my life, by the Great Seal of England) is to intro∣duce Foreign Princes or their publick Re∣presentatives to your Sacred Presence. And in regard the Place of Surveyour General was also intended to me (after late Inigo Jones) I do make bold to introduce the three Capital Princi∣ples of good Build∣ing



to your Sacred Majesty, who hath seen more stately Pa∣laces and Buildings, than all your Ance∣stors, and may be a Pattern to all future Posterity, by Build∣ing of your own Pa∣lace worthy your Self, and placing it as the Italians for their health, delight, and conveniencie (as well as Solidity and



Ornament,) La Ma∣tini alli Monti, la Se∣ra alli Fonti, accord∣ing to which the main body of your Royal Palace may be set on the side of St. James's Park, and the Gar∣dens along the Ri∣ver.
If the Book affords any thing worthy your Sacred Maje∣sties further satisfa∣ction, I have obtain∣ed



my end, and done the Dutie intended by,
