MADAM;
THE following Sermon, which was compos'd in a little time, and when a great many other things of importance lay on my hands, had never been expos'd to pub∣lick view, had not You more than once press'd it upon me, from the Affection I bore to your deceased Husband, my very worthy and most agree∣able Friend; whose Name will

be ever dear to me. But tho I am conscious it has many de∣fects, yet being design'd to ce∣lebrate his Memory, I thought my self bound by the Laws of Friendship, as well as the Ob∣ligations of Duty, to inscribe it to Your Name, from whom I have receiv'd the most libe∣ral and undeserv'd Favours. And tho it may in some sort renew your Sorrows, yet I hope, with the Blessing of God, it will tend to restrain 'em from excess.
Madam, You have all the assurance that you can have in this World of your late Consort's Happiness in the

next; he having only chang'd your pleasing, but temporary Society, for the endless Felici∣ties of Abraham's Bosom.
He has run his Christian Race, and receiv'd his unfa∣ding Crown: he has pass'd through an ill-natur'd World with an unspotted Name; for Envy it self could not stain his Character.
May his Virtues live in his Childrens Memory, and his Example in their Lives: May all the tender Branches of your hopeful Family become Plants of Renown; may they tread in their Father's steps, and serve their Father's God:

And that You, dear Madam, may long continue with 'em, to awe and guide their Youth, and to shed the Influences of your Virtues among 'em, is the unfeign'd desire of,
Madam,
