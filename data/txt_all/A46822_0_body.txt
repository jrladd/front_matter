RIGHT HONOVRABLE.
ALthough neither my person nor con∣dition can any way merit ought at your Lordships hands, yet the high and undeserved favours I have alrea∣dy received, and the benign aspect which your Honour hath been alwayes observed to afford un∣to the Devoites of such as have attempted to do but the meanest good service in Gods Church and Common-wealth; together with the Can∣dor and sweetness which accompanies all your actions, rendring you precious to all that know you; hath thus far emboldened me in all humili∣ty to crave, that, &c. 1 Cor. 1.22. This same foolishness of preaching
here inscribed, which notwithstanding is the wis∣dom and power of God to salvation, may march under your Lordships name, as under Ajax his shield, into the view of the World; which fa∣vour if I shall happily obtain, then as the Mari∣ners who carried with them Caesar and his fortunes; or as the Souldiers that advanced under the vi∣ctorious eye and protection of Titus, son to Ves∣pasiou; I doubt not, mangre all malice, pre∣judice and opposition, but to become in this pre∣sent service both succesfull and prosperous; For which my instant requests shall not cease to be presented before the Throne of Grace, that the spirit of Magnanimity, wisdom, and understanding may still rest upon your Immortall soul, and so direct your Honour in all your grave, and great imployments, for the common good and Church of God here, that in the end, he may receive you out of this , into his Church triumphant, the place of eternall rest and Glory.
