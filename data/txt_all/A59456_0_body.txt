May it please your Grace,
HAd I no particular Obligations to rg
me, yet my own Inclinations would
prompt me not onely to dedicate this
to you, but my self to your Graces
service: Since you have so much obliged your
Countrey both by your Courage, and your Wit,
that all men wo pret either to Sword, or
Pen, ought to shelter themselves under your
Graces Protection: Those Excellencies, as well▪





as the grat Obligations I have had the honour
to receive from your Grace, are the occasion of
this Dedication: And I doubt not, but that Ge∣nerosity
wherewith your Grace has alwayes su∣cour'd
the afflicte, will make you willing (by
suffering me to use the honour of your name)
to rescue this from the bloody hands of the
Criticks, who will not dare to use it roughly,
when they see your Graces name in the begin∣ning,
that being a stamp sufficient to render it
true Coyn, though it be adulterate. That au∣thority
that makes you able, and that great
Goodness that makes you willing to protect all
your servants, may give you frequent troubles
of this nature, but I hope your Grace will be
pleased to pardon them when they come
from
London, Spt. 1, 1668.
My Lord,
