churche from the
begīning was ne∣uer
clere from he∣resies
(moste reuerende father
in God,Oportet haereses . and most honourable
lorde) but hathe bene at all ty∣mes
styll vexed therewyth, for
the probation & exercise of the
elect: yet was it neuer so mise∣rably
tossed and turmoiled spe¦sially
with in thys Realme of
Englande (as I suppose) with
sectes & scismes, as it hath ben
of late yeres. Where as it hath

not onely bē counted laweful
for ye wycked to excogitate, to
teache, to professe, to mayn∣tayne
and defende errours, &
Herysies wythoute restraynt:
but also he that moost vylelye
coulde defyle hys mother the
churche, and like the hedder or
snake whiche gnaweth fourth

the holy sacramentes (the very
entrails or bowels of his mo∣ther
Christes spouse) was best
regarded, was taken and ac∣cepted
as most honest, most ex¦cellent,
most worthy mā, & best
learned. Suche were thought
most mee to examyne causes,
and beare rule in the commen
wealthe, for that they smallye

elles that wythoute the vnitye
of the Chatholyke and vniuer¦sall
church, there is no saluati∣on.
In other tymes we reade
here of one Heresye and there
of another: but in this wycked
season: Oh good Lorde what
Heresye (thoughe longe a¦go
condempned by Chrystes
churche) haue not they stur∣ed
vp agayne▪ And vnder the

childe shoulde styll contynue a
childe in the state of infancye,
and neuer increase further,
not markynge that the trueth
was fyrst sought, then founde,
after beleued, obserued, and fo¦lowed,

from all goodnes, from all ver¦tue,
honestye and grace: beyng
farre vnmete therefore for the
kyngdome of God, as Christe
sayeth in the gospel,Lu. 9. 8 Nemo mit¦tens.
&c. But oh, what vnspea∣keable

damnable heresies haue cau∣sed
moste miserable scisme a∣monge
the rude people, beyng
haled from the trueth and tos∣sed
from poste to pyller on eue¦rye
syde, euen lyke as it was
in the Arians tyme when the
Heritykes vsed most commen∣lye
bothe to saye and do many
thynges well to obtayne ther∣by
credit amonge the symple,
and weake, that so much more
freely they myghte sowe theyr
Herisies, and plucke down the
Churches (whiche was euer
their cheife indeuoure) and de∣face

all godly men,li. 3. tript ca. 2. li. 4. tript. ca. 44. 3. li. 7 ca. 40. li. 5. ca. 25. either with
violence, wyth punishementes
wyth slatterynge of promoti∣ons,
or wyth deceyte. Hathe
not this selfe same practise of
the Arians in all pointes bene
put in execution in these oure
wycked dayes?li. 5. tript. ca. 43. Then one wyc¦ked
styll praysed another as
well in naughtye bokes as in
publyke Hereticall sermons,
and all to deface therwyth the
godly catholikes: Was not the
same here in Englande nowe
practised? Yea, euen as Sy∣mon
Magus was of the wic∣ked
called Virtus dei,li. 2. eccl. hist ca. 1. et. 13. the po∣wer
of God, so haue in oure
dayes as vnmete and vnwor∣thye
laudes ofte bene made.
Then was there neuer so fo∣lyshe
nor grosse an Heresie, but

it had folowers: Was not the
lyke in thys oure blynde tyme?li. 12. trip. ca▪ 9.
and as then, styll they falselye
accused the godly sorte of trea∣son,
so to dispatche them out of
the waye: euen so, was nowe
the lyke practyse in cryinge a∣gaynst
the breakers of the kin¦ges
procedynges. As the god∣lye
styll wente then to wracke:
euen so they dyd nowe wyth∣oute
mercye or pytie, beynge
moste cruellye handeled, and
all wythoute iuste cause or de∣serte.
Then,ca. 39. li. 9. tript. they made ma∣nye
damnable and moste wic∣ked
lawes to defende theyr
noughtye Heresyes wythall:
haue they not done lykewyse
heare wyth vs?
Then the wycked Magistra∣tes
fauoured and exaultedli. 8. tript. ca▪ 3.li. 3. c. ca. 3▪

the wycked ministers, & great∣lye
plaged the godlie: was not
the same exacted heare in En∣glande?
Then to serue God
truely was cownted great of∣fence,
and was greuouslye pu¦nished:
was not the same done
here euen nowe on late? What
punyshement had they whiche
woulde but onelye be presente
in the churche at Masse tyme?
Yea, I my selfe sawe deadlye
checkes geuen to an honest ca¦tholyke
mā for knelyng down
on the steppes in Paules, for
knockyng vpon hys brest, and
lyftynge vp hys handes. At
what tyme the sayde honest
Catholyke man was glad for
feare of theyr tyrannye to say
he woulde neuer do so more.
O good Lorde what thynges

dyd men then bothe saye, and
do for feare of punyshemente?
Againe lyke as in the Arians
tyme Scismatikes and Heri∣tykes
dyd not onely contemne
(yea,li 5. tripart. cap. 30 condempne) the moste
godlye and general counsals,
but also made priuate coun∣celles
of their owne, ten in nū∣bre,
wherin they neuer agreed
amonge theym selues, no nor
neuer fullye allowed that in
one counsell whiche they had
made in an other: euen so now
in all poyntes oure wicked pro¦ceders
in this palpable darke∣nes
haue imitate and folowed
the former steppes of their for∣fathers
the lymmes of the de∣uyll.li. 1. tripert. ca. 20.
As then through Heresye
the holy misteries of Christe
were had in contempte: euen

so were they nowe.. 1. trip. ca.  As then,
the heretikes desire was stil to
cause the hygher powers to fa¦uoure
their Heresies: euen so
was it now.li. 4. eccl. ca. 1. li. 5. ca. 16. li. 1. trip. ca. 5. As then, the here∣tikes
styll cried, this is the ca∣tholyke
faith (meanyng theyr
owne heresies) this is the ca∣tholike
doctrine, this is the ca∣tholyke
churche: for this is the
faythe, the doctryne and the
Churche, of the Patriarches,
prophetes and Apostles: so did
the heretikes crie styll in oure
dayes, hauynge once the vp∣perhande
(as they had styll in
dede) throughe fauoure of the
Magistrates. And surely this
was the mooste soore, and the
moste dampnable perswasion
to deceyue and blinde the sym∣ple
innocentes wythall. The

Deuyll neuer perswadeth but
vnder the couloure of trueth:
yea, and he ofte hath both ler∣ned
and vertuous liuers to the
outwarde apperaunce to take
his parte, beynge his Angels
transfygured in to the Angels
of lyght.li 4. eccl. ca. 15. li. 4. trip. ca. 23. li. 1. trip. ca. 15. li. 3. trip. ca. 6, So that as▪ then they
dyd euer slaunderouslye blas∣pheme
and reuyle the true chri¦stians,
and woulde theyr own
decrees and lawes to be called
the trueth, their errours the ve¦ritie,
and them selues to be coū¦ted
godly & that their churche
was the catholyke church, and
they y• Catholikes and earnest
defendours of the trueth: e∣uen
so was it fullye and whol∣lye
within this Realme of En∣glande,
in all the miserable ye∣res
nowe paste. As then,

the Arians called theyr secte,li. 8. tript. ca. 13. li. 5. eccl. ca. 16.
when they suffred for their he∣resies,
holye martirs: euen so
now at this time theritikes cal
their champions which stande
obstinate to the fire, holy mar∣tirs:
not markinge (if I maye
speake a word or two by digres¦siō)
that the kinde of death ma¦keth
not the Martir, but the
cause, not markinge that euen
among the Hethē many haue
willyngly suffered deathe, and
yet no christen man so folysshe
as to call theym Martyrs of
God: not markynge agayne,
that I one of Kent (which said
christ toke no flesh of y• virgin
deniyng therby his manhode)
had fauourers whiche bothe
thought & sayd when she was
burnt, that she was the Mar∣tir

of God: but then surelye the
deuil shalbe called a confessor,
whiche confessed that Christe
was the sonne of God: Whose
confession was then as true &
as truly made, as either Is
of Kent, or els as any of theirs
whiche as obstinate heretykes
breake the vnitie of the church
diuide Christes cooe, and yet
crie the Lordes worde, the lordes
worde, wrestinge our lor∣des
holy worde to their condē∣nation.
Howbeit we may well
perceayue, that it is no more
wonder to se an obstinate he∣retyke
stande stiffe to the fier,
then it is to se a man kill, hāge
or drowne him selfe. The same
deuill which causeth the one cā
soone cause the other. But of
this matter I will speake an∣other

time. Nowe therfore (to
retourne from whens I haue
a litle while digressed) we may
easely coniecture that thonlye
cause of al these mischiefes and
miseryes that we of late haue
suffered, hath bene the breache
of thunity of Christes church.Cause of our miseries.
When we ones fledde forth of
Peters shippe, then we fell
streyght way headlong into al
licentious libertie: then we for¦saked
vtterly al general coun∣sels,
all ordinaunces frō the be¦ginnīg
kept in christes church,
al iudgemētes vpon scripture
saue our owne: then of singula¦rytye
we did select and chose a
new fayth, euery daye chaun∣ginge
and alteringe (and no
maruayle) after that our no∣ble
Prince through counsel of

some wicked men aboute him
toke that in hande, whiche ne∣uer
true catholike king did v∣surpe
before him: that is to sai,
to sit in Peters chere. Since
what time, oh good lord, what
misery haue we fallen into, as
wel bodylye as gostlye? But
nowe thankes be to Iesus
Christ which through his mer¦cye
hathe broughte vs againe
vnto our mother ye catholyke
church, euen into Peters ship:
and Iesus longe preserue her
amōges vs, by whose meanes
we were brought agayne into
it.li. 1. trip ca. 6▪ Now we se that God suffe∣reth
(as he didde in tharians
time) heresies ofte to floryshe
for a seasō, but yet euer ī time
of mercy he remembreth vs a∣gayne,
and wil not heresie stil

to preuaile, but yt we may haue
good cōfort & say wt Athā.li. 10. eccl. ca. 34. No∣lite
turbari frēs nubecula est et ci
to pertrāsit. Let not your hartes
faile you brethrē, be not dismai¦ed
(saieth he) this heresie is but
lik a litle cluod, it wil sone vade
away. Nowe we se also that it
was not withoute great cause
that S. August. sayde,In epi. fun. that a∣mongest
other thinges the suc¦cession
of the bishops of Rome
frō Peters time did kepe him
in the true fayth,li. 3. ca. 3. as Ireneus
had graūted lōg before. Now
we se yt, yt faith is to be receiued
beleued & holden whiche hath
bene kept of al mē, at al times
& in al places, of christendome
since ye begīnīg and yt we must
leaue onely to ye generalitye to
the antiquity & to the consēt of
the fathers al stil agreīg ī one

For experience sheweth (& no 
onely ye scripture, stories, & doc¦tors)
yt as heretik{is} be euer ful
of diuissiō & scisme, euē oft amō¦ges
thē selues (as appereth by
Luther, Ecolāpadi{us}, Carolo∣stadi{us},
& Swīg{us}. &c.) being li¦uely
figured ī ye cōfusiō at Ba∣bilō:
so are the catholikes euer
most surely knit ī this vnitye,
wherunto tholy ghost stil doth
moue & sūdry waies perswade
mēs cōsciences. Furthermore
we se clerely what wickednes
& misery it is stil to wāder ī pal¦pable
darknes frō error to er∣ror,
being ones out of ye vnity,
for which christ praied,Ioa. 18. li. 4. trip. ca. 24. saying:
O father graunt yt as y• & I be
one so mai these which beleue ī
me, be one ioyned & knit toge∣ther
ī one faith ī one cōfessiō in
one loue in one grace & pietye.

Nowe we se the cause why we
fell from this vnitie, and vpon
what grounde. We se the cause
was nothing els but to main∣tayne
wyckednes and synne.Cause of er∣rours.
We se what was the progresse,
and what styll folowed of it:
that is to saye, more synne and
more: errour vpon errour, and
heresye vpon heresie. We se al∣so
that the ende was almost vt¦ter
destruction of all together
bothe bodely & gostly: extreme
pouertie, extreme miserie: euen
as people quite forsakē of god.
Finally therfore we se, yt there
is no way so easie for the deuil
to bringe in all kindes of here∣sies,
errours, diuisions, scismes
contentions, strifes, and mis∣chiefes,
as is to denye the vni∣tie
of Christes churche, and to

forsake the head therof, the Po¦pes
holines. All heresies sprīg
hereout saith Ciprian.Epist. . . And for
this cause I haue nowe (right
honourable lorde, and most ho¦ly
father) taken this worke in
hande, and haue dedicate the
same vnto your fatherhode, a
chiefe and head pyller of Chri∣stes
churche, to the entente it
myght do more good, and the
soner be embraced of al catho∣like
people within this realme.
And herein accordynge to my
small talent, I haue not onely
declared by sundry probations
(some apparent, and some de∣monstratyue)
the moste hyghe
authoritie aboue al other both
spirituall and temporal, geuen
to Saincte Peter, and to hys
successoures for euer, but also

haue answered to all the comē
obiections whiche I haue ey∣ther
heard or redde deceitfully
inuented agaynst the sayd au∣thoritie.
Beseching your grace
well to accepte this my small
labour, and construe all to the
best for Iesus sake: Whom I
beseche longe to preserue your
noble and vertuous estate in
continuall honoure ioye and
prosperytye to the great com∣forte
and profit of all
true faythful peo∣ple
within this
realme: and
after
this life to graunt you eter¦nal
glory in heauen wyth
god almighty and his
holy aungels.
Amen.
