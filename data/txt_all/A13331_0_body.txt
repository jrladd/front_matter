I Present here to your Maiesties view my imperfections in their owne colours, and the excellencies of ano∣thr man with much losse of their lu∣stie, as being transported from their ntural light of the Latin by an vn∣skilfull hande into a strange language, perchance not so fit to set out a peece drawne with so curious a pensill. The cause of vndertaking a worke of this kinde was a good will in this scribling age no to doe nothing, and a disproporti∣on in the powers of my mind, nothing of mine owne inuenti∣on beeing able to passe e censure of mine owne iudgement, much lesse, I presumed the iudgement of others. The cause that J published it vnder your Maiesties name and protection (beside th testification of my bounden due∣tie) was the great account your Highnesse most wor∣thily holdeth this Histoie in; hoping thereby, that as some for the excellencie of th wine, haue liked also the lees, so it might peraduenture please you, to accept into some de∣gree of fauour this wore as it is, though by change from vessell to vessell hauin taken winde and lost his pleasing taste to the palate, yet retaining somewhat of his former strength, and much of his substance. But the principal cause was to incite your Maiesty by this as by a foile to communi∣cate to the world, if not tose admirable cōpositions of your owne, yet at the least tho most rare and excellent transla∣tions of Histories (if J ay call them translations, which haue so infinitelie exceed the originals) making euident
 demonstration to all who haue seene them, that as the great actions of Princes are the subiect of stories, so stories composed or amended by Princes, are not onely the best patterne and rule of great actiōs, but also the most naturall Registers thereof, the writers beng persons of like degree and of proportionable conceits wth the doers. And so wishing your Maiestie either so uch leasure your selfe, or a Tacitus to describe your most glorious raigne, J commit this worke (whereof I caime nothing to my selfe but the faults) to your most gracous patronage, and the curtesie of the reader, from whom, t least from his handes that shall finish out the rest, I hope o finde both pardon for my faultes, and some pittie for my paines.
The Almighty blesse your most xcellent Maiestie with a long, happie, and prosperous ragne, and the onely true meanes thereof, many vvatchfull ies to foresee, many va∣liant handes to fight, and many odly hartes to pray for the peace of your state.
