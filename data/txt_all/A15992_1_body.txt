ACcept (my Lord) into your Treasurie
Of Wisedome, Learning, this deuoted Mite;
In Widdowes offering out of penurie;
Thy Lord did more, than richest gifts delight.
Your Lordships worthy fauours did inuite
Mee to this boldnesse, when you first did raise
My lot which in obscuritie was light,
In better Fortunes for to spend my dayes,
For which I blesse your bountie, and my Maker praise.


As little Brookes which from the Ocean wide
Receiue their Source, thence watering hollow vaines
Of fruitfull Earth, backe to the Sea doe slide,
Yeelding some Drops of Tribute for their gaines:
Euen so a thankfull heart my Muse constraines,
This Tribute to your Bountie to repay,
And consecrate my labour and my paines
Vnto your Seruice, which I humbly pray,
Like Mite, to Treasure; Drop, to Ocean, answer may.



My Muse once rashly sought to enterprise,
To ranke thine Honour in the Court of Fame;
But knowing Thou such Glorie didst despise,
(In white stone seeking a new written Name,
Which he knowes onely that receiues the same:)
I chose this Song of Christ and's Church to sing,
Where if mine ignorance commerit blame,
I doe submit it to thy censuring,
Who art in pardoning, and giuing like a King.


With Spirit of Moses, Iosuahs fortitude,
The Faith of Abram, Isaacks happy peace,
With Dauids heart, Iobs patience be indu'd;
With Salomons wealth, and vvisdomes good increase,
From Samuels dealing Iustice, neuer cease
Be blest like Iob in his last happy broode,
With Pauls content, be it in paine or ease,
Let Churches hidden Manna be thy food,
Thy daies and strength, like Calebs, happy, long & good.
