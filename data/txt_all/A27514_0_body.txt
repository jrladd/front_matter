Right Honourable Lords, and you the Honourable Assembly of the House of Commons,
THere hath been no Christian Church be∣yond the seas, departed from Rome, which hath given so much honourable respect unto the Lords day (our Christian Sabbath) as
 wee here in this our flourishing Kingdome and Nation: And it was our glory so to honour the Lord Christ; and it will be our great unhappinesse to faile in this our Christian duty, so confirmed by Scripture, and the generall practice of all true worshippers of his glorious name throughout the whole Christian world, the space of these six∣teene hundred yeares.
Yet in this our time, and of late dayes, are stepped up among us certaine vaine men, prophane enough, who have attempted to deprive Christ Jesus of his glory (in the religious observation of this day, grounded upon his glorious Resurrection) and us of our spirituall consolation, in keeping an whole day set apart for his worship and service.
For this end, books upon books have beene written, and by licence passed the Presse, to take away the morallity of the fourth Commande∣ment, never, in any age heretofore, doubted of; to make also people beleeve, that our Christian Sab∣bath hath no warrant from thence, and that it is not of divine institution, but alterable from that first day of the week, equallizing their devised ho∣ly-dayes with it, and allowing also the like vaine sports upon this day, as upon the other dayes, cal∣ling such as religiously set the whole day apart for holy uses, Sabbatarians, and Iudaizers, thus re∣proaching, and in their sense, belying those that more truly honour Christ than they doe.
And that they might securely go on in these
 their prophane errours without controule, and per∣swade the more inconsiderate sort, that what they have written, are truths, and unanswerable; they have stopped the meanes of printing sound Anti∣dotes to their empoysoned propositions, where∣upon they have beene bold to insult over godly orthodox Divines, with too many words of inso∣lency, scorne, and much contempt; which they have borne with great patience, waiting the Lords leisure till he should bee pleased in his good time to give liberty for the publishing of their learned labours, which have of long time lien by them.
And now (blessed be God) the time is come, the way is made open by your honourable wisdomes, goodnesse, power, and authority, for godly and learned men to discover the vaine boastings, and the folly of those evill ones, to the view of all. Some of ours proceed polemically, and have made answer fully to the best esteemed of those prophane writers. Some only write positively, to discover the truth, and to make it knowne in a plaine way, that the meanest capacity may bee rightly enfor∣med: This way have I taken in this threefold Treatise, humbly craving pardon for my bold pre∣sumption in presenting to your honourable view these my weak endeavours.
But the cause is Christs, and so deserves accep∣tation and promotion: God hath appointed you at this time, as his worthiest and meetest instru∣ments for this end: I cannot therefore seek for other Patrons in exalting the honour of Christ,
 which by these men hath been so dishonoured, and his people so abused. For the redresse whereof, as you have nobly begun, so to proceed on to do ever valiantly in the best service of your God, there shall not be wanting the hearty and earnest prayers of

London, March 26. 1641.
