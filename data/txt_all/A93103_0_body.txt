SIR,
HAving for the satisfa∣ction of some Friends of mine, penned a Summary or brief collection of your wor∣thy Acts, and never to bee forgotten Archievements, for your Countrey, this last remarkable yeare, as, I hope, I truly say, and we effectually finde of our delive∣rance from those calamities which some few years since we had little reason but to expect. I could not
 finde a worthier or meeter person to whom I might dedicate these my labours, then your selfe: one prin∣cipall reason therefore, that you whose name is a terror to the enemies of Christ, might also be as a Buckler to defend this Work, which I ingeniously confesse was not compiled by me, wholy for lucre of gain, but out of an ardent and hearty affection I beare to your person, and the honour that I and all men ought to acknowledge your due. I know, Sir, that my language hath not fitted a matter of high concernment, which would deserve the pen of ano∣ther Tacitus: But I hope, Sir, that your Honour will as cordially accept the indeavour of the mea∣nest Souldier vnder you, as of the noblest Captain: Thus, Sir, not desiring to be guilty of writing a large Epistle to a short Treatise, I cease, and shall e∣ver remain, as is my bounden duty,
