SIR,
IF either particular favours exhibited to the Authour of any Book, or publick zeal for truth in the exhi∣bitant (two of the main grounds of Dedicatory Epistles) may oblige to a Dedication; I know none whom I can so readily look to as your self, from whom, as the Church of God hath received much good, (especially, whilest the Lord did imploy you in a publick trust) so my self in particular have shared of your influences. Your actings in publick seasoned with wise∣dome, piety, zeal and fidelity have made you pretious in the godlies sight, both in this and our sister Nation. Your seclusion from that trust hath made you
 less seen, not less vertuous: your influ∣ences are not bound up, but contracted, that they might be more forcible where they fall. Our cold Religion hath more of warmth by your presence, Whilest you are an example to some, and an en∣couragement of others to their duty. Your constancy, zeal for Truth, love to the Ministery, diligence in frequenting Ordinances, besides your Family wor∣ship, (and that in these fickle and cold times, wherein Ministry, Ordinances and Duties are every where cried down) do render you a worthy example to fro∣zen souls. Your respect to the Mini∣sters of Christ, (to whom your house is as Obediahs to the Prophets) learned from the example of your religious fa∣ther, is a great incouragement of them to their duty. Hereof as others, so espe∣cially my self have been a witness, and a large partaker, receiving the greater in∣fluence by my nearness to you, being for some time of your family, and still owned as your Pastor.
As a small acknowledgement where∣of,
 I humbly offer these first fruits of my publick labours, for under your wing they were sown, quickned and brought to this ripeness. They beg your acceptance and patronage, which if the Author obtain for them, He mat∣ters not the blustrings or hatred of Po∣pish adversaries against him. The weak∣ness of the work may receive strength Cum sapimus patrs: years may teach more knowledge: In the interim your favour may much strengthen it, but e∣specially Gods blessing, to which I commend both your self and it, and rest,
