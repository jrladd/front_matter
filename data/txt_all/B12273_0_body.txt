RIght Honourable, hauing at the re∣quest of a religi∣ous Knight (an Alderman of the Cittie of London) gathered this my Sermon into writing, and de∣liuered him the Copie; I was soone after desired (nay, importuned) by
 others (my worshipful good friends) to giue consent for the printing of it. Which, when I could not, in good manners (as I thought) farther put off; I was at length induced to con∣descend vnto: the rather, both in regard of the benefit, which by this my weake meanes may growe to the Church of God: as also, that (by seeking shelter vnder your Ho: protection) I had now a fitte op∣portunitie (long wisht-for) to ma∣nifest my dutifull respect, and humble affection to your Lord∣ship. This your Patronage, if it please your Honour (as an addi∣tion to your former fauours) gra∣tiously to vouchsafe mee; I can∣not but also acknowledge my selfe herein the more obliged in
 al boundē duties. Thus, humbly cra∣uing your Lordships fauourable ac∣ceptance of my faithful endeauours, I take my leaue.
 Dated the 8. of October. 1607.
