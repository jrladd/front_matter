SIR,
LEt the heighth of your understanding, and the greatness of your learning, con∣descend so low as to take a view of the words and works which your Servant hath bound up in this Volume: to give you a description thereof in me∣taphoricall expressions I have not Scho∣larship enough, but I have confidence enough to speak and publish the truth of these Experiments which I have gathered, with a diligent Eye and a painfull Hand from all such Plants as are cultivated in Gardens now in England: the truth of the Discourse contained in this Treatise, hath enboldened me to enrich it with your Noble Name; now Sir I will be accountable of the Work: I have from time to time took a due observation of that part of

Gods vegetable Creatures which are placed within the com∣pass of my Calling, and with pains, care and diligence, I have writ down the knowledg of propagating of each Plant, to help me the better in my Calling; for in viewing of it I am put in mind of those Herbs and Flowers that the Winters cold breath hath bereaved of life, or otherwise I might forget them though I might know them very well formerly: they are so infinite in their number, so various in their nature, that my Head cannot carry in mind what Experiments my Eye and Hand hath seen and done without the help of my Pen: upon this account I have set down these Observations which I know to be true, and I doubt not but it is a laudable Piece: now I think fit to publish it to the World for the advance∣ment of Gods Creatures, and for the good of my self and others that shall put it in practice, that it may be a rule to guide the ignorant, and confirm the judgement of those that have good experience. The reason why I undertook this Work is this; I have made diligent enquiry after such Books of such Authors as might help me in my Practice, and I could find very few, and for those that are they did not answer my desires, because they only treated of the use and vertue of Herbs, the beauty, variety and preheminence of Flowers, the goodness and profit of Fruit-Trees, but they have written little or nothing as to the practicall part of the advancement of the nature and growth of Herbs, Flowers, and Trees; and for that which is written, seems to me, and other Men which have experience, as fancies, dreams, and conceits which might come into their heads as they were sitting in their Studies; for I and others have found (by wofull experience) that their direction concerning the pro∣pagating of any Plant, to be more hurtfull than usefull; but this is not my intended Discourse, for in the ensuing Treatise, I have spoken little against Authors, and took less from them; for mine is the Gardeners practicall part, which hath never been written by any, and having good

experience therein (a talent God hath given me to im∣prove) I think it not fit to lay it up, but to unfold my Nap∣kin, that it may contribute to a publick good.
I further humbly conceive, that it was my duty to dedi∣cate it to you before any other whatsoever, because I was a Plant nourished up within the pale of your habitation, and I hope not altogether unfruitfull: yet considering I was nursed up with your bounty, preserved with your love and care, then the fruit is no more mine but yours worthy Sir, and I know it is very usefull for all as have a desire of such a Work as tendeth to the propagating of Plants, wherein is abun∣dance of excellent things both for food, medicable and phy∣sicall Arts for the use and comfort of mankind, that God in all things may be glorified; every sensible man knoweth this, and he hath so much reason (if he will but set his un∣derstanding awork) whereby he can discern the wisdome of a Creator, in forming such a harmony of Creatures, and in giving of them such various operations in their severall natures, and that all things are so ordained that it shall be no way usefull without knowledge and labour: then let all degrees of men know, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, they ought to labour either in body or mind, that they may some way or other cooperate and contribute to the common good, or else they are unworthy of the bles∣sings of this life: yet all men desire a good name, with re∣putation and honour, whether they are deserving yea or no.
Now my counsell is to all such, that they will look upon you, worthy Sir, as an example of all good endeavours, (to wit) your great love, care, and diligent search after the knowledge of those Plants which are mentioned in this Book, and that they will take notice of your more estima∣ble vertues, as constance in times of distraction, such a set∣led devotion in times of faction, such lowliness of mind in such heighth of Estate: much more my eyes and ears have

gathered from your eminent parts which my Pen cannot express.
And Sir, let me intrude farther on your patience, to ac∣quaint you with this Treatise, wherein I have faithfully de∣clared the way of contriving, modelizing and situation of a Garden of Pleasure, with artificiall Knots to be amplified therein, for the variety of delight, pleasure and contentment of all noble and ingenious persons. I have given rules and directions for the advancement of a physicall Garden and a Kitchin Garden, and for each of these I have given a right information, how each Herb, Flower and Tree in particu∣lar is to be propagated in its own nature; also Experiments of alteration, ingemination in the fructition, or by convi∣ction, with varieties, properties and beauties appertaining to Plants either for food, physick or pleasure; and I sup∣pose it cannot be altogether unwelcome to you and the rest of the Nobility of this Nation, if they take into their consideration, those excellent effects that I shew from the practice of a skilfull Gardener, as Fruit so desirable, Herbs so vertuous, Flowers so beautifull, how delightfull all these are placed in uniform ranks, whose beauteous lustre beauti∣fies the Banks, the Earths Cabinet, wherein is its chiefest treasure and School of Divinity: on the contrary, by reason of the ignorance of the Gardener in artificiall work, Noble∣men are deprived of their pleasure, their minds are dis∣contented, and the place is disgraced, if in propagating of Plants they will follow old errors, by reason of the dulness of their brains, and stubbornness of their wills, which will not let reason work, to know the times and the seasons, the difference in Climates, the mixture, the operations of the Earth, and the vast difference in the vertue of Plants; for want of these Observations the owner is deprived of his profit and earnest expectations of fruit, which cannot choose but be a trouble to Master and Gardener: to prevent these dangers I give this my testimony, which is a true relation

how Plants may be propagated and made fruitfull without any sensible error, it being some part of the best invention of my lean brain; I now right worthy Sir recommend it to you as yours, and my self as obliged to you by the Law of nature and gratitude, submit my self to your loyall will, and shall study the remainder of my dayes as now I do, how I may be truly worthy for to be
