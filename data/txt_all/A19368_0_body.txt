SIr,
hauing a great
desire, by some
meanes to signifie
my affection vnto
you: I thought I could not
better do it, nor find a more
readie meane thereunto, then
by preferring and dedicating
this little Pamphlet vnto you:
the which containing most
rare and excellent examples

of wise and wittie sayings, and
notable instructions to vertue
and vertuous actions, I sup∣pose
cannot more fitly be pre∣sented,
then vnto you, in
whose young yeares doth al∣readie
appeare a most to∣wardly
inclination and hope∣full
expectation both of wit
and vertue, such as your riper
yeares (I doubt not) will
bring to an excellency of per∣fection.
To the furtherance
wherof, albeit this smal Trea∣tise
shall perhaps be able to
adde little accesse, in regard
of the plentiful helpes, where∣with
you are alreadie furni∣shed
to that effect: yet it may
be that both the pleasure and
the profite thereof, may in
some sort proue worthie, both
of your labour in reading and

perusing of it, and of my affe∣ction
in offering it vnto you.
Not doubting therefore but
it shall be accepted, as plea∣singly
as I haue presented it
willingly, most humbly I take
my leaue.
