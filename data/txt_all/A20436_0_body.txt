SIR, the report of your perfection in this facultie, hath imboldened me to presume vpon your curtesie, the rather for that as experience in other things hath taught mee, howe Birds of one kinde, with mutuall consent helpe to support the younger and weaker sort, till nature hath sufficiently enabled them, so doth hope in this thing perswade me, that men of one disposition, will as willingly accord in their commenda∣ble exercises, tending to profitable ends, as the sencelesse Fowles of the ayre naturally agree, mutually to main∣taine their owne estate. Thus vnder your thrise wor∣thy protection, as a sufficient shelter from all the ayerie Buzzards shroude I my selfe, Dum virum me fecerit etas, which if you vouchsafe, it shall embolden mee so to im∣ploy my next vacant time, as may in some better sort re∣quite your VVorshipfull fauour.
