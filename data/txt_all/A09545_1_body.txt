MOst Honor'd Lord,
within whose reuerend face,
Truth, Mercy, Iustice, Loue and all combine,
Heauens deerest Daughters of Iehouahs Race,
Seeme all at full within thy Browes to shine,
The King himselefe (T'immortalize thy fame)
Hath in thy Name Foretiped out the same.


Great Verulam, my Soule hath much admirde,
Thy Courtly carriage in each comely part,
Worth, Merrit, Grace, when what the land desirde,
Is powr'd vpon thee as thy iust desart,
Graue liberall mind contending with the rest,
To seate them all in thy Iuditious brest.


Thrice noble Lord, how dost thou prize of gold,
Wealth, Treasures Mony and such Earthly cash?
For none of them thou hast thy Iustice sold,
But held them all as base (infected) trash
To snare, allure, out from a dunghill wrought,
The seared conscience of each muddy thought.



Weigh but my cause, referre me not to those,
That from the first were partiall in my right,
Ah this is more then once thine Honour knowes,
Thou seest mine owne hath now vndone me quight,
Whilst by a trick they got me in their paw,
Against the Order of thy Court and Law.


If I were such as some would haue thee thinke,
I meane my Foes which vtterly defame,
Mine Innocence and all together linke
To wound my state, and blemish much my name:
Yet Iustice wils, what in their hands hath laine,
Thus to my losse should be restord againe.


Ah, deerest Lord, hold but the Scales vpright,
Let Court nor fauour ouersway my cause,
To presse me more then is beyond my might,
Is but their Reach to crosse thy former Lawes,
Let me have Peace, or that which is mine owne,
And thy iust worth shall o're the World be blowne.
