Gentlemen,
THough I may appear to you a stranger,
your Goodness hath not been so to me; It
is not long since I received a rellish thereof.
Wines are tryed at the first peircing, not by quan∣tity,
but taste, and by a little We may conclude
the rest. My Ambition is satisfied, in that this
Year I have had the happiness to serve you; if
my endeavours fall short of your expectation, I
shall blush that my Abilities are not answera∣ble
to my Will, and begg your Pardon assuring
you, that I have done asmuch as the short allow∣ance
of my time would permit: but if in the Sur∣vey
thereof any thing meet with your liking, it
will be honour enough to him who is thereby
Licensed to subscribe himselfe:
Gentlemen,
