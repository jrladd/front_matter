Sir,
VVEre there nothing else to command my Regards for you, besides the Old Age, which your Out-living of Threescore Winters has brought you to the Borders of, That were enough to give you a room in my Esteem and Reverence, and Veneration. I cannot but approve the care of the Greek Language, to make no more than one Letters Difference between the words for Old age, and Honour; and I cannot but applaud that conditi∣on of the World, whereto refers that famous Distich. Magna fuit quondam Capitis Reverentia Cani,
In{que} suo pretio Ruga Senilis erat.
The Marks of Respect put upon Old age among the Antient Lacedemonians have been the matter of many pleasant and famous Histories; and the modern Ve∣netians owe not a little of their Prosperity as well as Reputation unto the Figure which is allowed unto Old age among them. That people is not like to be long-liv'd, among whom, Fathers and Mothers, and those that have lived long, are not acknowledged; and that plant whose Younger Branches put a sleight upon the Elder, is for that cause by the Ingenious Botanist, called, Herba Impia, or a Wicked Cudweed When Old such an one, is used as a Term of Disgrace, & when Juvenis vetulo non assurrexerit, I stil think that I see none of the smallst among the Verbal and Real Solaecisms of the World. But somethig beside
 and beyond your meer Approaches to that Age, which will place a Silver Crown of Gray-hairs upon your Head, it is that causes me now to Dedicate unto you, the little Treatise of, The Old Mans Honour, now laid before you. 'Tis because you have, The Old Mans Honour, adorning of you; not only by having Served your People, both as a Ruler to them at home, and as an Agent for them abroad, when God gave you Opportunity; and we know the Name of that people with whom it was a Law, that none but Good Old Men should have the Honour, either Magistratum Gerere, or Legationem Obire; but chiefly by your Acquaintance with Him that is from the Beginning. Many years are now rolled away since you began that blessed Acquaintance; and I am well satisfy'd, that like the most fruitful old Polycarp, you will profess your self not yet weary of your Glorious Master. As 'tis my Duty to Desire, so I have Reason to Expect, that the nearer you come to be an Old Man, the more you will put off the Old Man, which is Corrupt according to Deceitful Lusts; that white you are an Old Man you will be found in the Old Way, wherein you will find Rest for your Soul; and that you will be One of those in my Dear Flock, whom if after I have Preached unto others, I do not my self prove a Cast away [which let Free Grace pre∣vent!] I shall meet at the Right-hand of the Lord Jesus Christ with unspeakable joy, and whom I shall spend an Happy Eternity in the praises of a merciful Creator and Redeemer with; All which is humbly pray'd for, by
Sir,
