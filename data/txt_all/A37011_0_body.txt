SIR,
GReat Courtesies, which are in their value beyond gratifying, grant the re∣ceiver this Excuse however; that he may expect a Pardon, if his En∣deavour be answerable to his real Will and natural Ability.
I am extreamly Sensible of the many Favours I have had from you, and I am as sensible of the very few ways my ill Stars make me capable of return∣ing 'em this little flourish, Sir, is only to Introduce a common Truth, which your Iudgment can inform your self very well without my telling; which is that a Poet has no better way of paying his Gratitude, than by an offering of the Fruits of his Brain, to the generous Person he is oblig'd to.
Sir, if I had not known you to be one that has made it some part of your business as well as diversion, to encourage things of this Nature, I should not have troubled you with this, but the Conversation which for some years I have had the honour to enjoy with you, has given me this boldness, asuring my self, that as you have the same good Humour as formerly, so you have a Gusto and Relish to taste with the same Appetite now, as you did at other times, when I have been so Happy to enter∣tain you with the like sort of Treat.
Sir the Comedy I now present to you is in the best Iudgment of my most judicious Friends one of the best of mine, and till I see more and better Matter and Humour in a scription of this kind, I shall not be uneasie when I think on the little poor abuses and disturbances of a malecontented Party, that like the Devil have for some late Years ow'd me an ill turn, and I have reason to fear now will never have done pay∣ing me.
The entertainment of Songs and Dances in it, as they gave more diversion than is usually seen in Comedy's, so they were perform'd with general Applause, and I think my Enemies have cause to say with greater than is ordinary; and though this had its Inconve∣nience by lenghtning the whole Piece a little beyond the common time of Action, which at this time o'th Year I am sensible is a very great Fault, yet the worst of malice has granted me this, that there appeared no defect of Genius, whatever there might of Iudgment.
The Perusal therefore, Sir, most humbly I commit to yours, and dedicate both my self and it to you, whom I know to be a Man of honour and sence, in which at∣tributes, I think all others are comprehended, and since I know your temper too well, to inlarge much upon Complement, or trouble you with impertinent Praise, I will only think of you as all the sensible World does that know ye, and make an humble Suit to ye to accept this Trifle as a mark of Gratitude from,
SIR,
 London, May 6. 1693.
