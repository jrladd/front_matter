FInding (right
Woorshipful)
so great vtte∣rance
of your
Christian af∣fecttō,
imme∣diatly
after the spirituall exerci∣ses
I kept at CHESTER in the
STREET: I could not but now in
dedicatiō of Loue-memorials,
signifie my duetifull thankfulnes
towards you, not onely amidst,
but that more is, in the fore∣front
of my Friendes. Accept

therefore I pray you, not a hand∣full
of the Persians vvater offe∣red
to an vncircumcised Kesar:
but a handfull of the vvater of
Life, offred by the Lord his poor
servant, vnto an open professed
Christian. A vvise Lapidarie
chooseth not stones so much for
outward quantitie, as inherent
qualitie: nor I hope, vvill you so
much measure my guift with the
bodily eye, as by the Line of the
Mind, or spirituall eye: where∣upon
setting downe my wrest, I
here rest: Beseeching the Lord in
all goodnes, to be vvith you and
yours for ever, Amen.
