YOƲR most excellent Maiestie being graci∣ously pleased to reade and approoue the writ∣ten Copie of that J haue now printed, and withall to declare your princely pleasure (sufficient warrant) for publishing the same, J haue thought meete in all humblenesse of dutie to your Maiestie, and in all truth of zeale to my countrey, by this meanes to endeuour
 to resolue them which doubted, to per∣swade them which denied, and to con∣firme them which applauded the most happie intended Vnion of your Highnes two most famous kingdomes of England and Scotland. J was not ignorant that the copies of the obiections against it, were this Tearme caried into most parts of those your Maiesties Realmes (and I suppose also beyond the seas) which might in time without answer seeme to preiudice your Maiesties honor vniustly with scandale abroade and murmure at home. Therefore though I be most vn∣worthy to publish to the world my meane vnderstanding in a matter of such graue consideration and great consequence, yet haue I rather chosen to hazard my poore credit subiect to each sensure, then suffer
 a cause in its owne worth so precious, to sustaine wrong by generall silence: for obiections are of force, where no answer doth refute. Onely I humbly craue your Highnesse pardon for my bold presump∣tion, and will euermore with hands and heart lift vp to heauen, pray to God for the preseruation of your gracious Ma∣iestie, and of your royall issue, in all honor, health and happinesse.
