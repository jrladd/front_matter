Right Honorable, My singular good Lord:
AS it runnes in our Spanish Tongue: Quien á buen arbol se arri∣ma, buena sombra le cobija; He that retires himselfe vnder a good tree, findes both good shelter and shadow: This I haue found most true by my owne experience, in that since my voluntary banishment out of my natiue Soile, for the peace and libertie of Conscience, into this flourishing Kingdome, like a poore stranger, being in a Labyrinth of worldly cares and necessities: It pleased your gracious Lordship, not onely to vouchsafe mee the protection of your Honourable house, but (though most vnworthy) further to conferre vpon mee many great
and important benefits, ioyned with Noble promises, of my more preualent preferments, when fit opportunitie serued, that I cannot but applie my selfe in all the hum∣blest offices within my poore power, to manifest there∣fore some due and vnfained gratitude. Seeing (as learned Seneca saith) the best returne of a benefit, est grata beneficij memoria: Wherefore, as it hath pleased your gracious Lordship, to countenance, and suc∣cour the Author, extend the same honourable protecti∣on and defence, to this his poore labour and worke, ex∣posed to the deprauations, and malignities of so many powerfull aduersaries. The Subiect is Diuine, the Te∣stimonies sincere, and the End Religious and profitable; the beames therefore of your honourable and fauourable countenance will soone dispell these fogges and vapours, Gods true worship and seruice will hereby bee aduanced, and my vnworthy selfe most highly satisfied, if vnder the shadow and safegard, of your honourable wing, I may but liue and die,
