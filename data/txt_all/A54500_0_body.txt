My LORD,
THE Love and Protection Your Lordship has ever shown to Letters and Antiquity, has long since demanded some return from the Melancholy Porers upon Wax and Parchment. Ours is not gay and enlightned like the Muse of Poetry: It may want Flattery, and Wit, but it is very Capable of Truth and Gratitude: We aspire not to the imitation of Oracles, foretelling Greatnesses that are to come, but in a heavy way, of pusling on old Cha∣racters, revive dead Glories that have long been lost, and by a kind of Sacred Magick, salute Mens Eyes with the dear Images of Famous An∣cestors. Your Lordship that has such a share in our Antiquities, cannot but delight to see several Famous Knights, whence You descend, enter this Nation with the Great Norman; and by their Valour win those Lands, which from them have devolv'd unto your Lordship: Nor will it
be less pleasing to perceive a perseverance in those Virtues from their Suc∣cessors, shewing on several Occasions, Magnanimity, Valour, Fidelity, Pru∣dence, and other Effects of estimable Wisdom, and Generosity, that have so long preserved the Fruits of their first Labours to Your Lordship's use.
I am sure it will be agreeable to Your Lordship, at least so far as to procure Your Pardon for any Errors may have unwillingly fallen into the Endeavours of,
My LORD,
