Gentlemen,
THE Printing of the following Sermon, now al∣most Forty Years after it was Preached, needs a longer Apology, than at present either my Lei∣sure will allow, or others perhaps will have Patience to read: To save therefore my self and others from a
needless Trouble, I shall only tell you, That these Notes were bury'd among my Papers, and out of Mind, but upon a particular Occasion they came to Hand. Ʋpon a short view of them, I conceiv'd they might be of some use to quicken Magistrates in that Noble and Important Duty, of the Reformation of Manners, which of late hath been publickly counte∣nanced and own'd by many persons of great Name, Noblemen, Bishop's, and Judges.
The Author of the Account of the Societies for Reformation, hath with a commendable Zeal, and many unanswerable Arguments, urg'd this Religious Design upon all sorts of Men; and there seems not to be any necessity to add any thing to that which is so excellently done already; yet such is the weak∣ness of Human Ʋnderstanding, that even where the Conviction of Reason is so clear and full, as makes new Arguments useless, yet through the Weakness either of Memory, or want of due Impression, we are apt to let them slip. In this Case where Ar∣guments are useless, a Remembrancer may be neces∣sary.
This Sermon was Preach'd at a Critical Time, as appears by its date; to speak Boldly upon such a Subject at that time, seem'd so hazardous, that those that heard it, expected that I should meet
with some Effects of the Judges angry Resentments; but such was their Conscientious regard to the Mat∣ter that was spoken, and such were their Convicti∣ons of the Truth and Weight of it, that contrary to all expectation, they publickly recommended the Sermon to the Consideration of the Grand-Jury, and in private also gave me their Hearty thanks.
The main Drift and Design of the Sermon is, to Excite Magistrates to countenance the Practice of our Holy Religion, and to punish Vice and Decauchery: Seeing then this is the thing that is now expected from Magistrates, as their Duty which they owe to God, and to the Safety and well government of the Country; why may not this be useful to them by put∣ting them in remembrance.
Many of the Reverend Pious Clergy of both De∣nominations, have preach'd and printed Sermons for the promoting of a Reformation; this though preach∣ed long before, yet is not printed so much out of due Time, but that it may come in the Rear.
This Discourse I humbly offer to the serious Con∣sideration of the Magistrates of the Nation, and more particularly to you, whose Names are prefix'd to these Papers (as the present Magistrates of the Famous Town and County of Newcastle upon Tyne, where I
have lived many Years,) partly as a Testimony of my Respect to your selves, which I am oblig'd to, for your civil Respects to me, and partly as a Testimony of my best Wishes to the whole Corporation, for their Spiritual and Temporal Prosperity, but chiefly to give you my Thanks publickly for what you have already done, in prohibiting Tipling in Publick-houses on the Lord's-day: 'Tis a good Beginning, and you have honour'd your selves so much by it, that Judge Powell in his Charge at your last Assize, thought fit to take No∣tice of it.
Honour'd Gentlemen! Give me leave to tell you, that a Reformation of Manners, is a truly Religious and Noble Ʋndertaking, you will hereby shew that you take God's part, and fight against the Devil's Kingdom: You may expect that the Prince of Darkness will stir up his Instruments against you, but the Battle is the Lord's, and if you faithfully plead his Cause, and put due shame and disgrace impartially upon Debau∣chery and Vice, he will stand by you, and own you, and your Names will be Honourable among all good Men.
Be strong therefore, and quit your selves like Men and good Christians, you have many considerable Ad∣vantages on your side, besides the Divine assistance and protection which is the Chief; you have not only
the Advantage of Law, but the Example and Encou∣ragement of the most considerable Persons of the Nati∣on; you may promise your selves the hearty Concurrence of all the Serious Religious Clergy, whose Office it is by all means to Promote the Honour of God, to whose Service they have devoted themselves, and you may expect to see the Blessed Effects of your Religious Endeavours, to your great Comfort and Satisfacti∣on.
I shall only add this, The hearty Agreement and Concurrence of Men of different Perswasions in other Points relating to Religion, in promoting of the Practice of serious Piety, and in putting a Disgrace upon Vice, is the best Means that was ever yet offer'd for the Agreement of all our Differences in other Matters; this is what all good Men would be glad to see: But as the Case stands, there is little Ground to hope or expect it, and the great Thing that stands in the way, is the Perjudice which is deeply radicated in the Minds of the con∣tending Parties, occasion'd by mutual Reproaches, Revitings, and Passion, that our angry Contentions have produc'd against one another: This Prejudice is now become so invincible, that except this holy Oil of Brotherly Concord in this Matter do soften it, and beget a love in Men seriously Religious, the Fire will not be extinguished: We are already agreed in
the Doctrinal Articles of the Church of England, and if we were as heartily agreed too in the End of all True Religion, as in the Principles, a farther Progress would be more feasible: This might be suf∣ficient to beget a brotherly Love to one another, and then we would more calmly hear, and more clearly un∣derstand our mutual Reasonings about the remaining Differences, which would either incline us to Condes∣cension for Peace sake, or enable us to bear with one another, so that all might keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. That such Effects may be produc'd shall be the Prayer of
