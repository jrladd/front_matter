My LORD,
THough never any man had more need of excuse for a presumption of this nature, then I have now; yet when I have laid out every way to find one, your Lordships goodness must be my best refuge, and therefore I humbly cast this at your feet for protection; and my self for pardon.
My Lord, I have great need of protection, for to the best of my heart I have here published in some measure the truth, and I would have

it thought honestly too, (a practice never more out of countenance then now) yet Truth and Honour are things your Lordship must needs be kind to, because they are Relations to your nature and never left you.
'Twould be a second presumption in me to pretend in this a Panegyrick on your Lord∣ship; for it would require more art to doe your Vertue justice, then to slatter any other man.
If I have ventured at a hint of the present sufferings of that great Prince mentioned in the latter end of this paper, with favour from your Lordship I hope to add a second part and doe all those Great and Good men Justice, that have in his Calamities stuck fast to so gallant a Friend and so good a Master. To write and finish which great Subject faithfully, and to be honou∣red with your Lordships patronage, in what I may do, and your aprobation or at least pardon, in what I have done, will be the greatest pride of
(My Lord)
