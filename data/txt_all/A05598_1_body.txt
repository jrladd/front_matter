DEare Gentle READER, graunt mee this small suite,
Reade this ou'r kindlie, and no fault impute:
I cannot please the VVorlde, and my selfe too,
For that is more, than brauest Sprites can doe.
Heere I am plaine, and yet the plainest way,
Is fittest for the Diuine Muses aye.
A greater VVorke, I meane to put in Light,
But LONDON claimes it of a former Right.
And if thou knewst how quicke, and in small time,
This VVorke I wrote, thou wouldst admire my Rime.
Thou mightst demaund the Reason why I sing?
And done; this Answere, I would to thee bring:
There's some that sweare, I cannot reade, nor write,
And hath no judgement, for to frame or dite.
And to confound their blinde absurd conceat,
My Muse breakes foorth, to shew their Errour great.
These Calumnies, enuious VVormes spue foorth:
They grieue to see mee set at anie VVorth.
The Cause is this, These Giftes I haue, they lacke,
And from my Merite, they their Malice take.
O! if I might their Names in Print foorth set,
A just Reuenge, their just Desert should get.
But to the VVise, the Learned, and the Kinde,
The Noble Heart, and to the Vertuous Minde,
I humblie prostrate mee, my Muse, my Paines,
If I can win your Loue, there's all my Gaines.
