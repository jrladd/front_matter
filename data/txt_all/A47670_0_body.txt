Monseigneur,
THe Unfortunate Abra-Mulè, belov'd by two Sultan's and a Visir, yet so, that neither of the three could be happy in the enjoyment of her, is come into France, to unfold the secret In∣treagues which her Beauty occasion'd in the Ser∣raglio, and which pull'd down Mahomet from the Ottoman Throne.
She begs to appear under the Auspices of your Serene Highness, and she is in hopes, Sir, that a Prince, who together with all the Ver∣tues of a perfect Hero, possesses all that Love is capable to inspire, will not refuse a Sultaness so amiable and so vertuous, the honour of his Pro∣tection. She flatters her self with it, Sir, and the troubles that overwhelm her will meet with a pleasing Consolation, if your serene Highness, while you recreate your weary'd Thoughts in reading the fatal Success of a Tenderness so fa∣tal as hers, afford it some little sence of your Compassion.

But, Sir, Your serene Highness will not only behold in this short History the secret of an amo∣rous Intreague, you will see there the Events of War, which will be yet more pleasing to that undaunted Courage which renders you the Glo∣ry of your Country. This undaunted Courage, supported by all that can form an accomplish'd Hero, is the fire of that Royal Blood that runs in your Veins; an Emanation of the great Soul of that invincible Prince, that incomparable Condè, whom France beholds with so much pleasure re∣viv'd in your vertues.
Continue, Sir, continue to tread the steps of that Gyant, and may that formidable arm of yours, the weight of which the Enemies of the State so often have felt, be one of the most firm supports of the first Monarchy in the World. My good Wishes follow you where ever you go, and the chiefest wish I make at present, while I take the liberty to offer you this little Piece, is, that so long as I live, I may be,
