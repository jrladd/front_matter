May it please your Highness,
YOUR Highness having thought it convenient that I should put in print the writings I have received concerning the horrible massacre committed upon the poor Protestants of Piedmont, I humbly dedicate them to your Highness, as to whom they do of right be∣long, not onely because they were sent me to present to your Highness, or that your Highness hath received them from other hands, but chiefly for that every one know∣ing the Piety of your Highness, and the fer∣vent Charity you have testifi'd to the poor Protestants, the strait Communion you hold
with them, and the care you have of their preservation, it seems as if your Highness were particularly interess'd herein. And so much the more, because this cruell action was chiefely executed by the Irish, as in revenge to those who have driven them out of their own Country for the cruell Massacres they there committed. So that every one believes your Highness will expresse a deep resent∣ment hereof, and will endeavour the conso∣lation and reestablishment of many thou∣sands of persons escaped from this Butchery, who have chosen rather to quit their Houses and Goods, than to make shipwrack of their Faith. This also is an occasion, which God by his providence hath set before your Highness, to shew the incomparable zeale which you have for his service and Glory, and to give to the Protestants an evident prof of the affection your Highness bears them, and to confirm them in the confidence they have conceived of your Highnes Protection. This all the Israel of God expects from your Highness upon this occasion, looking upon your Highness as a Zerubbabel, whom God
hath sent for the repairing of his Hierusalem. I beseech the Lord, who by the marveilous dispensations of his Providence, hath rais'd your Highnes to this great dignity, that he would grant you to be the Protector of the people of God in all Nations, as he hath in this, and that he would long preserve your Highness, to the end you may imploy the power he hath given your Highness for the accomplishment of his great Works, for the defence of his whole Church, the preservati∣on of them which remain, and the reesta∣blishment of the desolate and afflicted for the propagation of his Gospell, the advance∣ment of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the Glory of his great name. Which is the Prayer,
My Lord,
