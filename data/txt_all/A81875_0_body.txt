SIR,
HAving received much dun-e served Kindness from you, I cannot let slip the first occasion to publish my Gratitude and Respect to you, who not only by your Wisdom and Prudence in difficillimis tempori∣bus, in the worst of Times, preserved unspotted and untainted your Reli∣gion and Loyalty, but also by
 your Temperance, Moderation, and Sobriety, preserved your Health, and have prolonged your Life almost twenty Years beyond the usual Age of Man; and had happily practised the best Rules and Precepts in this small Treatise, long before it was extant in any Language. Now, that God would please to continue your Health, and as you were Born before the beginning of this Cen∣tury, so to lengthen your Life at least to the beginning of the next, to the Comfort of your numerous Issue and Relations, the Benefit of your Neighbours, and Relief of the Poor, shall be the constant cor∣dial Prayer of,
Dear Ʋncle,

From Trinity-Colledge in Oxford, 24 of June, 1686.
