Worthy Sir,
WHen I had ended this Dis∣course, & bethought my selfe of a Subject, who for hs loy∣alty and love to his King and Country, might answer and sute with the subject in hand, ad as it were stand in stead as a faire light at the entrance of the dore, to shew others the way; your selfe came to my remembrance; who have so clearely exprest your affection to eiher. Indeed by th Law both of God and Natue, every man according to that ability God hath blest him with∣all)



is bound so to doe, but the greater number want the meanes, and burthens of this nature mst commonly lie upon te backs but of a few, yea many there are, who (thouh able enough) in hard and dangerous times (like foolish pa∣tients in a desperate disease, who will not be perswaded to be let blood though it would save their lives (will not yeeld their assistance, till forced by ex remity or a stronger hand: this the Citizens of Constantinople prooved by wofull expe∣rience, when they were surprized by Mahomet the first, having such a masse of money and treasure in their hoses, that the Turkes were astonyed thereat. I ra∣ther set before such, that true paterne and mirror of Magnificence, (so highly honoured and admired, even untill this day, for so many wayes deserving of his Countrie) Cosmo de Medicis, of whom the Florentine Historie thus reporteth. This Cosmo (saith he) was the most estee∣med and the most famous Citizen of Flo∣rence, (being no man of warre) either in

Florence or any other City, because he did notHist . lib. 7. only excell all others of his time, in authoritie & richs, but also in wisedome, for among other qualities that advanced him no be chiefe in his Country, he more then other men liberall and magnificent, which liberality appeared much more after his death then before, and though he did Princely things, yet in his conversa∣tion, riding abroad, or marrying of his children or kinsfolkes, hee was like unto all other men, modest and discreet, because he well knew that extraordinary things, which are of all men with admiration beheld, doe procure more envy then those which without ostentation are ho∣nestly covered; surely private men have equalled many Prince in Magnificence, I might alledge many examples for this purpose. But I onely shew how much we are first obliged to God, then to all those who study to provide for the safe∣ty of their King and Country, the advance∣ment of Gods Church and true Religion, of which number (Sir,) as you are one so eminent, here on earth, so may you receive your reward with the number of



those, whose piety and deeds of mercy, shall receive their reward in another Kingdome.
