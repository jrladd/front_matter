Madam,
YOur will is a Law
to me, and the least
beck of your com∣mands
the Alarum that cals
all my Intellects and Facul∣ties
into a posture of serving

you, to which they are so
addicted by a naturall pro∣pensitie,
as they are never
more in their owne Sphere,
then when they be moving
upon your Ladiships Er∣rand.
Nor is this without good
reason, since that rare cum∣ble
of Graces and Vertues,
that Venus and Minerva
have treasured up in the fair
Tablet of your face, and rich
Closet of your mind, have
made such a perfect con∣quest

of me, that my will is
but the Eccho of yours, or
rather I have no will but
your pleasure; the palpita∣tion
of my heart, and pulse
of my affections, so observe,
and keep such even time
and measure with yours, as
they are no longer mine, but
your owne. And (Curious
wonder of Natures sweat)
proud am I that you will
make use of your owne, in
giving a Theame to my
Muse, who nor knowes, nor

delights in any other, than
the praises, or (cause thats
too high a flight for her
flaggie pinion) the admira∣tion
of your Ladiship. But
such as she is, she glories to
be yours, and in that Live∣rie
comes to prostrate at
your feet a Jargon of a few
rambling passages, thought
upon only in obedience to
your Commands.
For may it please your
Ladiship to remember, that
among other passages of en∣tertainment,

at Sir Johns,
there happened a confe∣rence
concerning the omni∣potency
of Love, and triumph
of Beauty, in pursuance of
which the Trojan Prince
Paris his Judgement was
called in question, and he
blamed for disposing of the
Ball (as he did) to Loves
Mistris, when two other
great Deities were her com∣petitors;
Your well-worded
Brother (compared with
whom I am lesse than a sha∣dow)

pleaded stifly for
Juno, Sir T. B. Bartt for
Pallas, and there being none
that had taken up the Buck∣lar
for Venus, your Ladiship
commanded me to become
her Advocate; so that there
was rather a necessitie of,
than an Arrogance in, my
undertaking it.
Now (Excellent Lady)
so auspicious were my Stars
to me (above merit) that
these course-waled Passages
found good acceptance

from that noble Company,
but especially (which I was
most ambitious of) from
your Deare selfe, who bad
me file them upon the Re∣gister
of time, lest they
should evaporate into aire,
and be lost, and enjoined me
to give you an exact Copy
of them, promising to over∣value
them so far, as to let
them find roome in your
Cabinet.
See here then (Fair Queen
of Hearts) these few Flow∣ers

by me stuck upon Venus
her tresses, expanding them∣selves
(like the Marigold to
Phaebus) to the Sunnie
beames of your eyes, in
whom it lies either to che∣rish,
or scorch them.
Nor Madam durst I own
the thought, that you would
once open those starry Case∣ments
of your Soule, to glance
upon these creeping Ideas,
but that I may call them (in
a manner) your owne, for
it was your breath that

gave them birth, though
they were conceived by,
Madam,

From Grayes Inne.
