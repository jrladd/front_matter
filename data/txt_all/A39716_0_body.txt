My Lord,
THose who write Books ought to have more regard to their leisures who read them, then to their own in writing them; this makes me so short in writing this unto your Highnesse, which so declares (in passing) the life and actions of your Highnesse Father (of glori∣ous

memory) as there is scarce any remarkable passage in his life, which if it touches not, it points not at, at least; a subject which I am so far from elevating above its height, as all my forces can scarcely su∣stain its weight; nor did this deice me from undertaking it, muchless the enemies I under∣took war against in writing it.
For the war of Pens con∣tinues longer then the war of Swords, and grows commonly more sharp and cruel after death, until time gives the deciding blow at last, and fame alwayes determines it

for the conquering side: Mean time his Fame has two Ene∣mies to provide against; the E∣nemies of his party, & the E∣nemies of his person. The first so noble, it honors vertue even in an Enemy; the last so base, as it calumniates it in all, and against these chiefly I under∣take this war; neither is the Age, then Vertue, less con∣cern'd in it; for whilst every one judges according to their own affections and inclinati∣ons; and the young interpret all to Vitiousness, as the old all to Interest, Policy, and Ambition: we shall (in time) need a Dictionary for Acti∣ons

as well as Words, or else the Language of Truth will be wholly lost, and Posterity well may doubt whe'r there ever were any such thing as Vertue and Honesty in the Age. To vindicate and clear it from which Aspertion, I have writ this Treatise, to let Posterity know, that as there wanted not some in this Age to do brave and noble things, so there wanted not others to celebrate and honour them.
And this Fame 'tis which is the better life of all He∣roick persons; for short is the space they live in their

Bodies here, but immense that they live hereafter in their Fames; which life, only wri∣ters can bestow; nor can Time hang more plummets on their feet to weigh them down unto oblivion, then writers pens add wings unto their Fames to raise them up again; to which, if mine may add any thing amongst the rest, it will be rather my glory, then any addition unto his:
But I forget, and destroy with one hand what I would build up with tother, in being so long in the Epistle whilst I intend brevity in the work. I end then my Lord,

with the profession and pro∣testation of being always
