I Here present unto your Lordship the Fruits, if not the Follies also, of my younger daies, not published now, if the audaciousnesse of some others had not made that necessary which in my own

thoughts was esteemed unseasonable. The reasons why I have no sooner published these Relations, and those which have inforced me to do it now, are laid down in the following Preface, sufficient (as I hope) both to excuse and justifie me with ingenuous men. But for my boldnesse in giving them the countenance of your Lordships name, I shall not study other reasons then a desire to render to your Lord∣ship some acknowledgement of those many fair expressions of esteem and favour, which your Lordship from my first coming to Westminster, hath vouchsafed unto me Your known abilities in most parts of learning, to∣gether with the great respects you have for those which pretend unto it, encli∣ned you to embrace such opinion of me, as was more answerable to your

own goodnesse then to my desert, and to cherish in me those Proficiencies, which were more truly in your self. And for my part, I alwaies looked up∣on your Lordship as a true Son of the Church of England, devoted zealously to her Forms of worship, the ortho∣doxies of her Doctrine, and the Apo∣stolicism of her Government; which makes me confident that these pieces will not prove unwelcome to you, in which the superstitions & innovations of the two opposite parties, are with an equal hand laid open to your Lord∣ships view. Nor shall you find in these Relations, such matters of compliance only with your Lordship in point of Judgement, as promise satisfaction un∣to your intellectuall, and more noble parts; but many things which may af∣ford you entertainments of a different

nature, when you are either spent with study, or wearied with affairs of more near importance. For here you have the principallest Cities and fairest Provinces of France presented in as lively colours, as my unpolished hand could give them; the Temper, Hu∣mour and Affections of the People, generally deciphered with a free and impartial Pen; the publick Govern∣ment of the whole, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, described more punctually then ever heretofore in the English Tongue; some observations intermingled of more ancient learning, but pertinent and proper to the businesse which I had in hand. You have here such an accompt also of some of the adjoy∣ning Islands (the only remainders of our Rights in the Dukedome of Nor∣mandy)

that your Lordship may finde cause to wonder, how I could say so much on so small a subject, if the great alterations which have hapned there in bringing in and working out the Genevian Discipline, had not occasio∣ned these enlargements. Such as it is, it is submitted with that Reverence to your Lordships Judgement, which best becometh
My Lord,
