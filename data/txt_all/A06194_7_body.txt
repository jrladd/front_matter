Happines for euer.
KInd frend. Forced fauours vvere euer sleighted, & thankles. But voluntary respects had euer vvith the best, and most noble minds courteous acceptāce hovve small, & meane soeuer the thing vvas. For a mā to giue his soule to his Creator vvhen he sees he must dye, & his goods to the poore,

vvhen he sees he must part vvith them, & to forgoe our sinne, vv vve can noe longer follovve yt are cold, yea vnkind obediences. But for a young man to remember his creator in the daies of his yout  & in his best, & strongest age  bequeath himself euery day to god in prayer, & praise is that∣reasonable, & seasonable sacrifice vvhere vvith the most high is most pleased. To this purpose and noe other god knovveth I haue tendered these voluntary Essaies to diuerse of my masters, & Table∣brothers. Let me not seeme to to officious, vvhile I desire to doe good, & expresse my loue. For  vnto the rest so vnto you Beloued Gā-naunt haue I sent this parcell. Receaue yt, as I meane yt both vvith hand, & hart, & then 

am assured; it vvill neuer repent you of your acceptation, nor me of my dedication. The great lord keeper of heauen, & earth keepe you in his feare all the daies of your life, & preserue you for his sauing mercies in Christ Iesus in the end of your life, & for euer.
