Right Worshipfull and most worthy Sir;
I Make no other Apologie for my selfe in respect of the Publication, and Dedication of the ensuing Ser∣mon, then that which Dauid made to his brother Eliab (who rashly iudged his forwardnesse in comming to the battle to proceed from the pride and naughtinesse of his heart) Is there not a cause?1 Sam. 17.29. Might it haue dyed the common death of other Sermons, it had beene dead and buried out of sight, but loath I was that it should suffer a violent, and an ignominious death through the false ca∣lumnies, and ignorant censures of some ill affected spirits,

and therefore I haue sought life for it, that it may liue to the world, and speake for it selfe.
I present it to your Worship; Protection I desire not, if it be truth deliuered, it is Gods, and able to defend it selfe; if error, it were an insufferable wrong to abase so worthie a Patronage for the Defence of it; Acceptati∣on I craue; and this your wonted and natiue courtesie, to∣gether with the great respect you beare to the meanest of our Tribe, assures me of.
In which confident expectation I binde my selfe,
