MY NOBLE LORD,
THAT these Sheets do appear in publick, under the Pa∣trociny of Your Lordships Honourable Name, Flows from the same Motives offered in the late Dedication of this Nature. Not to insist upon the Proofs of your Lordships undeserved Respect to me, or my more, im∣mediat and Personal Knowledge, than many others of my Capacity, of your Lordships Christian Fortitude, and Unbyassed Stayedness in such a Tryal of your Faith and Patience, and Juncture of searching Tryals, as may Justly be called the Persecutionis turbo▪ The Af∣finity of the Subject, and Scope of this Work, doth Justly Plead for the same Patrociny. As Pastors are set for the Defence of the Gospel, have a

special Concern in the Vindication of Opposed Truth, so the Magistrate according to his Capacity, being a Keeper of both Tables, hath by his Office an unexceptionable interest in this Important and Honourable Em∣ployment. It is an additional Argument, in point of Equity and True Honour, that the Writings Examined, do highly asperse, and cast a base Imputation upon the Nations Authority and Laws, as if Erecting and Maintaining, yea, and engaging His Majesty in the Maintenance of a Government of the Church, cross to Apostolick Institution, and the Churches Universal Practice, such as is eversive of True Unity and Or∣der, a Nursery of Novel Bigotrie, tending to Revive the late Bloody Broils, infesting these Kingdoms. None will doubt, when the Honour of the Nation is thus Wounded, Rulers Concern in a Just Vindication▪ But the Ground appears yet of a Higher Import and Elevation, if it be supposed, that the Government Aspersed, is that Divine Frame, appointed by the Ascended Saviour of the World, Recorded in his perfect Testa∣ment, and Sealed with his Blood, and the Exercise of his Kingly Office, as Political Head of His Visible Church. Who will doubt in this Case, that this King of Kings requires of Rulers, a Proof of their Faithfulness to him, in a Suitable Vindication and Assertion of this His Interest?
The High and Honourable Character, wherewith your Lordship is Digni∣fied, hath no doubt made upon your Heart, such an Impression of the preventing Goodness of GOD, as will excite to a due endeavour of the Best improvement thereof, and the Scriptures of GOD presents many strong Arguments to this Scope, in the Instances of such, who have been fitted for the most Eminent pieces of Services to GOD's Church in their Generation, by preparatory Tryals, in His Furnace of Affliction, and some∣times unexpected promotions have had such a Comfortable Issue. We know by whom Hamans Mischievous Plot was defeated, and what Argu∣ment Mordecai made use of, to excite to Act for this great Interest, when Carnal Wisdom and Prudence offered a strong Disswasive; that Glorious , who owns Promotion to places of Eminency as his Prerogative, who

changes the Times and Seasons, removes and sets up according to his Plea∣sure, hath told us, that he knows them by Name, Surnames them, hol their hand, and hath a special Eye upon them, whom he calls, for his Servant Iacobs sake, to do him Service. It is Considerable, that one of the best of Men, and best of Rulers, had this in a sadly wrong Step, Ob∣jected, as an Aggravation of Guilt, that GOD had Raised him up when he was little and low in his own Eyes. There is a time when GOD, not only gathers the Outcasts, but confers Honour upon them, He hath his Fire in Sion, and Furnace in Ierusalem; at that Furnace He sits as a Refin∣er, intent upon this Work. To be brought forth out of this Furnace of Affliction, as Gold, in proof of GOD's having Chosen a Man in the same, is a great and pregnant Blessing, but to be brought forth as a polished Instrument of signal and Honourable Services to him, and His Interest, is a double and Crowning Blessing, especially when Tentations upon the right and left Hand, are vigorous and strong. The Promoting of the Glo∣ry of this Great and Gracious GOD, in Maintaining and Contending for His Truth and Interest, the true Established Doctrin, Worship, Disciplin, and Government of this Church, is that which in the first place, is to be intended, and all other Concerns in a due subserviency thereunto▪ It is worthy of Observation, which is Recorded of one of the Wisest Men and Rulers, that his First Care was, the Building the House of GOD, he fi∣nished it in Seven Years, but was in Building his own House, Thirteen Years thereafter; and when this work was wholly perfected, 1 King. 6.37, 38. 2 Chron. 8.1. his preparing his Store Cities, his Fenced Cities, and taking Care for his Tribute and Navy, was his Secondary and reserve Work. The Iewish Historian, Iosephus, hath this Remark upon it, and gives us this account, viz:
That this First work of Solomons was by GOD's special Assistance, perfected in so short a time, but the Palace though its Magnificence was Inferior to the Temple, yet the Materials thereof, not being so long prepared, and the House being to be Built for the King, and not for GOD, it was the more slowly brought to Perfection.
That the whole of your Lordships Walk in this Eminent Station, may Demonstrat, to the Refreshful Observation of all the Lovers of our Sion, that GOD hath Preserved and Polished your Lordship in all preceeding Tryals, to be a Honourable Instrument of Raising of this decayed and desolate Church, a Successful Maintainer of Equity and Justice, and that this your Faithful acquittance may yeild Solid Peace, Embalm and make Savoury your Name in after-Generations, and be found a Success∣ful mean of entailing the Choisest Family-Blessings upon Your Lordships Posterity, is the Serious Prayer of,
MY NOBLE LORD,
