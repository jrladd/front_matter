AS it was not (right Ho∣norable) the great ex∣cesse, & abounduance of ANTONIVS glut∣tinge fare, but the lytell precious Perle of CLE∣OPATRA that wan¦the price, when thei con¦tended, whether of thē might deuoure more at one meale: Euen so this my lytell volume wherwith I present your Honour, may argue vto your Lord∣ship a more manifest proofe of my good will towards your Honour, then y• rich Iewels and sōmes of gold & siluer, y• wordly minds do vse to gratifie their frends withal. Ther¦fore I knowynge your Honour to be of the lyke mind with hym y• was Iudge betwene CLEOPATRA & ANTONIVS, lightly esteme, & highly contempne al bribyng gol∣den

gifts that as much or more glutteth ver∣tuous minds, then might Antonius excessiue fare: I haue presumed, to offer vnto your Honour, a smal Pearle of y• pearless Poet and most Christian Ethnicke Seneca, wherin no glutting, but swete delectacion, is offred vnto y• mind that doth hunger after vertue. But I neede not to burnish Gold beinge so bright of it self, neither to cōmend the value of it vnto him whose skilfull & lerned iudge∣ment cā beter esteme of it thē mi imbecilitie is able to expresse. Therfore trustyng your Honour (whose ale in fauouring & furthe¦ryng all learnynge & good Studies is most manifest) wil accept my good will signified by this trauel of my simple, rude & vnskilful pen, & beare with my bould attempt, wher∣vnto your Honors great curtesie hath high∣ly encouraged me to aspire, beseching your Lordship to take vpon you the tuicion of so weake a Fortresse, whom wtout your trustie aide, the parlous force of yll onges might soone ouerthrow: promisyng your Honour hereafter the further fruytes of my ryper Muse, I cease at this instant to trouble you: whom I leaue to he tuicion of our sauiour Iesus Christ: wishing our encrase of ho∣nour, long lyfe and luckie successe in all af∣fayres and attempets.
