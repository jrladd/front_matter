SIR,
THere i none amongst all my ble Friends unto whom the Dedcation of this Sermon doth more properly be long, then unto your Self. For e∣sides that debt of Honor which I owe to our Family, not onely for the favors received from your self, but from your noble Father and Grandfather, nw with God; When I consider the vey great love, and high esteem which your Fa∣ther did bear to that good man, at whose Funeral this Sermon was preached▪ unto whose care e in∣usted the Two rops of his Family, your Self, and your most hopeful Brother (whom God took from that School to a celestial Academy▪) and with al, your own hereditary possession of the same love and esteem, as a grateful return unto this learned man for his special care in your education; and when I further remember the noble thoughts and singular honor which this worthy man ever had towards your Father, your self, and all the Relations of your Fa∣mily; it was not possible for me to look further for a name to inscribe before this smal Book. I have therefore assumed the boldness to put so poor a te∣stimony of those honorable affections which I owe unto you, and of that great love which I bear to the nam

of that good man, who was so dear unto you, into your hands; as knowing withal how much the Ar∣gument of this Sermon would be acceptable unto you, who can experimentally subscribe to the excellency and use of that Learning which it pleadeth for, and as an eye and ear witness can attest the Character of that worthy peson, to whose Obseques this last of∣fice of love was performed. My hearty prayer for you unto God is, that he will crown all those great Blessings which he hath bestowed upon you, with  more abundant greatness of his heavenly Grace, tha you may be eminently serviceable to his great name, and may so tread in the steps of your worthy Prgeni∣tors (which I perswade my self you do) as not onely to keep up the life and power of Godliness in your own heart, and Family, but further to be a Comforter, Countenancer, and Encourager (as they were) both of learned and godly Ministers, and of others who love the Lord Iesus in sincerity. To his gracious protection and blessing I commend you, and all yours, desiring to be esteemed
