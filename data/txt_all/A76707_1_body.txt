My Lord,
ALthough the com∣fortable beames of your infatigable goodnesse do so con∣tinually extend themselves to
 the supporting, and supplying the weak Members of Christ, your great Lord and Master: that haply your left hand hath forgotten what your right hand hath done for me the unwor∣thiest of your servants for his sake. Yet I can neither be so ungratefull, nor so ungracious, as not to record your manifold favours, so freely conferred up∣on me: they are often in my mouth, but alwayes in my mind. And being led by Provi∣dence to this present opportu∣nity:
 I felt it as a duty incum∣bent upon me to manifest the sense of those perpetual ingage∣ments, whereby you have ob∣liged me to honour your singu∣lar pietie and bounty: And therewithall to present you with a Servant, or rather an Asso∣ciate: whom (being so like un∣to your self) I humbly conceive you cannot but well like of. My Lord: He is the right Heir to the rich Inheritance conveyed in, and by that eternal Cove∣nant of Grace. It was upon
 your account, that I was fur∣nished with Oyl to supply the glimmering Lamp, whereby I was enabled to proceed in his search: which (contrary to your more Noble intention) was so unhansomly snuffed, that it could hardly light me to my journeys end, Or probably this poor Pilgrim had appeared unto you much better accommo∣dated: Yet the best aray, that my conscience can afford him, is the naked Truth. It is hoped, that being thus barely discover∣ed,
 some abler hand will furnish him with richer, and more sute∣able Ornaments: I humbly be∣seech you to entertain him ac∣cording to the reallity of his fi∣delity and sincerity. I shall not need to say, that I will leave him at your door, for me thinks, I see him already the Master of your house, and intirely fa∣miliar with your whole Fami∣ly, As being all governed by the same Doctrine and Disci∣pline of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 To which, I am confident, that you will constantly submit, according to the condition of his Covenant of Grace: till he receiveth you into his King∣dom of Glorie. Which is, and shall be in the dayly pray∣ers of
