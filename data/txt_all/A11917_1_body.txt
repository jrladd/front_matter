IF thou (gentle
Reader) hast any thing
in this small Uolume
which may commende
vnto thée, the trauaile
and paines of the Auc∣thor
of thys Englishe
Tragedie, surely I am
much the gladder: but
if all doe not aunswere
thine expectation (as it
muste needes so bèe by∣cause,
there is nothing
harder than to please all men) sith that thou art not priuy
to all things, disclose not rashly thy foolish iudgement. If
the translating of Latine, or other Bookes of other lan∣guages,
into our mother tong, doth eyther profite the cō∣mon
wealth, or the wryter at all, do not then condemne
the yong sprong writers, if that in all pointes they please
not thée which may by the grace of God, through thy gē∣tle
and curteous accepting of a little toye, hereafter em∣ploy
their labour to more serious and weyghty matters,
both to their owne commoditie and thy learning, and es∣pecially,
to the profit of our natiue countrie. Wey there∣fore
wisely, what thy friendly good will may do, not vn∣to
me onely, which am like to doe very little, but vnto o∣thers,
whose hearts with fauour thou maist easly win, to
the vndertaking of greater matters: and then willing∣ly
embrace both my good will, and trauaile.
Farewell.
