HOnour is due to him that doth advance,
VNdoubted truth, with lively circumstance.
MVch of this skill this Authour hath found out;
PVts Sinto silence: questions out of doubt.
HAving pursu'd the cause of desolation,
RAising the hearts sweetly with meditation.
YOur soules may see, their enemies descri'd,
MAns wit is pliable, truly sanctified,
IN laying siege, 'gainst sinne, thy Poetry,
LEaves it accurst, in hellish destiny.
LEt not thy conquest die, let's know the thing,
SAlly forth little booke, feare no deadly sting.
