HOW much more hap∣pie
might I account my selfe,
(right honourable Sir) if I had
so well applied my time in this
Vniuersitie, as through my more
dilligent studye, I were able to
handle the matter, (which I
haue in this Treatise taken vp∣pon
me) as the worthynes thereof dooth meryte.
Truely Sir I was for a time, drawen into a doubtfull
ballaunce, whether I should proceede therein, as my af∣fection
intised me, or leaue it off, as good discretion
aduised mee. Eftsoones haue I righte hartely wished
that some of those rype, and perfect witts, adorned with
like iudgement, (wherewith God hath plentifully blessed
this our age) woulde haue imploied their pennes, lear∣nedly
to haue sette foorth thys cause: But seeing that
in wishing, I doo fynde nothing, but to wish, and
that the case so standeth, as eyther the thyng, right
woorthye bothe knowledge, and practise, shall styll

lie in a slumber, or rather rest buryed in the graue
of obliuion, vnlesse I doo make publique my weak∣nesse
and insufficiencye, and therby subiect my selfe
to the diuersitye of mens iudgements, I haue made
choyse, rather to indure the disgrace of the one, then
that my Countrey shoulde sustaine the inconuenience
of the other, trusting that your honour (who hath
hetherto beene a principall Patron of this Action) will
vpon my humble sute vouchsafe your fauourable pro∣tection
heereof. For wee doo reade (right honoura∣ble)
that Archimedes in respecte of his grauitie and
wisedome) helde that reputation amongst the Syracu∣sans,
that whatsoeuer he allowed, was accounted for
good: which historye, if I shoulde apply vnto your
honour perticularlie, as both aptlie and truely I could,
I might (in the opinion of some men) incurre the sus∣pition
of flattery, and receiue from your Honour but
the like aunswer, which King Theseus made vnto blind
Oedipus.
I doo not (quoth hee) O Oedipus, honour my selfe
with other mens words, but with mine owne works.
In silence therefore will I passe your ready and ver∣tuous
disposition, bothe honourably to fauour, and
fauourably to further all such attemptes as seeme plea∣sing
to GOD and profitable to your Countrey, both
which (by the testimony of good writers, the opini∣nion
of wise men, and experience of great trauailors,
these VVesterne Discoueries doo certainly promise. In
regarde whereof, I doo the rather presume to pre∣ferre
this Pampflet to bee Patronized by so woorthy
a personne, whereby my escapes may bee the more
easilye excused, my willing paynes the better accep∣ted,

and the voyage more effectually supplyed.
Thus beeing lothe any longer to detayne your ho∣nour
from your weightye affayres, I humblye take
leaue, beseeching GOD manie yeeres to lengthen
your life, with much encrease of honour. From my
lodging in Oxforde, the tweluth of Nouember.
