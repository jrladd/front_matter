My much-honoured Lord and Lady:
AS that speciall duty which I my self owe to you both; so that purpose which my deare hus∣band had (while hee liued) of dedicating to you this Commentary of his

vpon S. Peters Epistle, bindeth mee (who am left his sole Executrix, to see his Will euery way performed) to set out this first of his workes published since his death, vnder your Honourable Names. It plea∣sed you to take into your Family a childe of his body: be further pleased (I pray you) to take into your Patronage this childe of his soule; which, as an Orphane, yea, as a Posthumus, in all humility is presented vn∣to you. You manifested more than ordi∣nary kindnes to my husband while he li∣ued; wee and ours haue oft tasted of the sweetnes of your bounty: so that I should deserue to be accounted most ingratefull, if I should bury so many fauours in obli∣uion, or neglect to prouoke others to loue and good works, by proposall of your ex∣ample. Accept, I beseech you, this poore acknowledgement of thanks; which is most due, first, to that primary Fountain of all goodnes, Almighty God, for kee∣ping your Lordship safe in your late im∣ployment in the Palatinate, and for free∣ing your Ladiship from those fears wher∣unto you could not but be subiect, by rea∣son of his long absence; and for giuing

you both, a mutuall and comfortable frui∣tion one of another: And next, to your selues, for all those kindnesses, which, while my husband liued, you did to him and his, and since his death you continue to do to such as he hath left behinde him. Now, the good God continue his blessed protection ouer you both, and take all that belong vnto you, vnder the wings of his fatherly Prouidence. And so I rest, with the renewall of my sute, that you would cast your eyes vpon this Worke of him who much honoured you in his life∣time; and is, after his decease, offred to you by
