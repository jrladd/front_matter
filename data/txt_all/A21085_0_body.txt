IF I had thought (right Wor∣shipful)
that Sladers tong
could greter haue ened this
my rude Booke, then the how
of my good will herby vnto
you, shoulde ease my desi∣rous
mynde, I would then haue styed this
bould enterprise, which with hasarde of goo
report I haue attempted. But such is the af∣fection
of a well meaning harte, that sooner it
offers it self to the sightfull blotte of scorne∣full
defame, then desire should want eyther
by signe or déede, to requit receiued bene∣fittes.
The tossed barke, seld findes the desi∣red
porte, without the stormes of the aire, the
surges of the sea, and the force of the enemie:
and it is as harde for the idell marchant to
encrease his stocke, as it is for the cowarde
Knight to gaine lastinge memorie: So harde
it is for me (whose abilitie is as well knowen
to your worship, as to my selfe) without the

poysned hate of the stinking tonge, the ma∣licious
scornes of the enuious head, and the
dispightfull scoffes of the shamelesse counte∣nance,
to aduertise you of my desirous mind,
ready at all times to pleasure you. The enfec∣tion
of whose filthie iawes, I haue rather
chosen by happie aduenture to escape, then by
lurking silence, still to reaine an vnknowen
welwiller. This onely resteth, and this is it
which seekes to staye my hastie hande: The
simplenes of the gifte, whiche if you regard
not, but thinke well of the willing giuer, I
liue happie, nought fearing the force of
scornes blast. Thus wishinge to your wor∣shippe
happie health, wealth to the best con∣tentation
of your harte, lasting life, and to
me (yours) abilitie once to answer your great
curtesie. I end. From my chamber at Staple
Iune. the first day of August.
