Madam,
IT was the Custom in former Ages when Offerings were made to va∣rious Deities, that the Adorer made choice of that same Numen, to which he thought his Oblation would be most Grateful. The same reason encourages this Address to your Ladiship, in hopes the Subject of it will be acceptable to a Personage so eminently fam'd, for be∣ing so highly concerned in the late Mi∣raculous
Revolution, and your assisting the Deliverance of these Oppressed Na∣tions. To you therefore Madam, this Compendium appeals, as an accom∣plished judge of Truth where 'ere you find it, or in what ever dress.
'Tis true Madam, the Present is but inconsiderable as is the Quality of the Presenter. But Persons in your Station look down as well as upward? Which if your Ladiship shall vouchsafe to do with an Eye of favour upon this unworthy Offering, it is the chief Hap∣piness aspir'd to by
Madam
