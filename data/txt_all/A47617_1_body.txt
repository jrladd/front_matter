SInce it is you, Sir, who inspired me with the thought of underta∣king the defense of our common cause, against a Prelate of the re∣putation of the Bishop of Condom, be pleased also to become responsible to the publick, for the manner in which I have acquitted my self herein. I am perswa∣ded a man could not set here a better name than yours, to do no wrong to himself, or to give more weight to the Answer, he had made. It is notorious that you are known through all parts where desert is known: You are equally loved and esteemed by all worthy persons, both of one and the other Communion, and by the Bishop of Con∣dom himself. And as all the world agrees, that none can wear a spirit or an heart more upright, than that which you own, so it will be easily presumed, that those sentiments which you shall have approved

are no less sincere and faithful. Nor can any say, that this is an Anonymous Work, in that they see not my Name here, if you will be pleased it be known, that he, who writ it, has the honour to be one of the friends of Monsieur Conrart.
