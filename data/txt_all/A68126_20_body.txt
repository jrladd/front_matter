RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
LEt it please you to receiue from the Presse what you vouchsafed to require from my pen: Ʋn∣worthy I confesse either of the publike light, or the beames of your Honours iudicious eies; yet such as (besides the motiue of common im∣portunity) I easily apprehended might bee not a little vsefull for the times; which, if euer, require quickning: Neither is it to no purpose that the world should see in what stile we speake to the Court, not without acceptation. This, and what euer seruice I may bee capable of, are iustly deuoted to your Lordship, whom all good hearts follow with true Honour, as the great Pa∣tron of learning, the sincere friend of Religion, and rich purchaser of Truth. The God of Heauen adde to the number of such Peeres, and to the measure of your Lo: graces and happinesse.
