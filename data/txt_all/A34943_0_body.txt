Madam,
THe Zeal I find run through the whole Nation to express its high value for your Roy∣al Highness, has begot in me an am∣bition to promote so Noble a Design; and since the appearance of so mean a person at Court could add nothing to its Lustre, I have set my thoughts at work how to contribute somewhat towards it in my retirement.
At Your first coming among us, our Loyalty to our Soveraign, and our Duty to his only Brother, dispo∣sed

us to do every thing in our power that might be acceptable to so great a Princess: But Your Royal High∣ness's condescending to the simpli∣city in which we live, Your affable deportment towards all that have the honour to come near Your Person, and Your seeming pleased with our weak endeavours to serve You, do justly challenge that respect as due now to Your self, which we must however have paid to Your Quality.
When we reflected how long we had been strangers to a Court, we could not but think our selves ill fit∣ted to receive a Princess Born and Bred in the Paradise of the World; One whom the Greatest Courts of Christendom had admired, and who had been used to nothing below the best of our British Accommoda∣tion: only as we then knew Your Roy∣al Highness came prepared to bear

with the plainness of a Northern Cli∣mate; so we since find you are in some measure delighted with it: and we begin to flatter our selves, that the happiness of so illustrious a Guest, which was procured to us at first by Your Obedience, is now continued to us by your choice.
These things having already gain∣ed Your Royal Highness the hearts of all this Kingdom, I thought I could not employ my self better than in en∣deavouring to confirm our Venerati∣on for Your person, by an account of Your Family; and as we easily ima∣gined it to be no Ordinary One, so upon an exact search, I find that Italy has nothing more Ancient or Great to boast of.
Your Heroick Ancestors have been shares in all the Memorable Trans∣actions of Italy these twelve hun∣dred years and upward: They have

oftner than once rescued it from the Barbarous Nations; their Reputa∣tion for great Generals has set them since on the Head of most of the con∣siderable Armies of Lombardy, and no Blood has been more prodigally sacrificed in their National Quarrels, than that of Esté. Nor has Italy alone been the Theatre of their Glo∣rious Actions, or the Seat of their Greatness; Germany is able to bear testimony of both. The Ancient Dukes of Bavaria, so famous in Hi∣story, were Princes of Esté; and their Off-spring, the present Dukes of Brunswick and Lunenburgh, who in Birth yield to no German, and who have had the Imperial Crown in their Family, yet seem to glory, Madam, in their being descended of Yours. To all this we must add the great Alliances by which the Princes of Your most Serene Family

have wisely kept up their Grandeur, as appears by their matching into the Houses of Austria, of France, and of Arragon, and to most of the Royal Families of Europe; so that I may with much assurance say, That there is no Nobler Blood in Chri∣stendom than what runs in Your Royal Highness's Veins, and that the Greatness of Your Birth is not infe∣riour to that of Your Condition, it be∣ing but sutable that a Princess of a Family next in Dignity to those of Crown'd heads, should be set next a Throne.
So great an Argument deserved, I confess, to have been managed by a better Pen; yet how much soever it may suffer in my hands, I am infi∣nitely beholden to the negligence of others, that reserved to me the ho∣nour of paying You this Tribute, which I offer with all humility to Your Royal

Highness. If you vouchsafe it Your Gracious Acceptance, my Pains are excessively rewarded, and I shall hereafter glory in what I dare not yet own without rashness; for seeing the work is more likely to lose than gain reputation by so obscure an Au∣thor, I have not the confidence to make my self publick by any other Name, than that of being,
MADAM,
