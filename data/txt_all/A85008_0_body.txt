Worthy Sir,
IN this plundering age, where∣in the fludies of so many have beene ransacked, and many papers intended for private solace and content∣ment have bin exposed to publike view, it was my fortune to light on the ensuing dis∣course: It seemed to me pitty that it should be strangled in obscurity, as conceiving it might conduce something to the delight of the Reader; for surely no ingenuous person can be so constantly serious, ye a surly and Criticall, but to allow some intervalls of refreshment not onely as lawfull but ne∣cessarie.

Let such morose, yea mischievous spirits pine themselves to walking Anatomies, who brand all refection of the mind by ludicrous intermissions to be unlawfull, to spare an heavier censure (which may more resent of anger) the worst I wish them is alwaies to eate their meate without sauce, and let them try whether their palate will be pleased with the gust thereof.
In the following discourse there is no∣thing presented but sweet Flowers and herbs: I could wish it had been in the summer time, when the heate of the Sunne might have improved their fragrancie to the greatest advantage and rendred them more acceptable to the smell of the Reader: Being now sadly sensible that Autumne the Vsher of winter will abate of their sweetnesse, and present them much to their loss.
Sure I am no bitter Colloquintida ap∣peareth this our Herball; I meane no tart and toothed reflections on any. Dull are those witts which cannot make some
 smile, except they make others cry, having no way to work a delight and complacency in the Reader, save onely by gashing, woun∣ding and abusing the credits of others.
It is desired, that this discourse may but finde as much candidnesse as it brings, and be entertained according to his own inno∣cency. I have heard a storie of an envi∣ous man, who had no other way to be reven∣ged of his Neighbour, who abounded with store of Bee-hives, then by poysoning all the Flowers in his owne Garden wherein his Neighbours Bees tooke their constant repast, which infection caused a generall mortality in all the winged cattell of his Neighbour.
I hope none have so spleneticke a de∣signe against this my harmelesse Treatise, as to invenome my flowers with pestilent and unintended interpretations, as if any thing more then flowers were meant in the flowers, or as if they had so deepe a root under ground, that men must mine to un∣derstand some concealed and profound my∣sterie
 therein, surely this Mythologie is a Cabinet which needeth no key to unlock it, the lid or cover lyeth open.
Let me intreate you Sir to put your hana into this Cabinet, and after therein you finde what may please or content you, the same will be as much contentment unto your
