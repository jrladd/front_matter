Right Honourable,
I Offer unto your Honours the first and greatest task (though the meanest work) that hath been yet undertaken; which
 is, to make the right and power of private Churches consistent and sociable with the Magistrates power over them, & so to sever by Di∣vine right the sacred functi∣on of Ministery from that of Magistracy, as to make both their jurisdictions but one, and derive it from the soveraign power of the State, and this from the Lord Iesus Christ, who hath given unto the Magi∣strate soveraign power and
 authority for a soveraign end; even to set up and pro∣mote the interest of his Kingdom. It is one of the most dangerous heresies that ever the wicked one did sow among his tares, that the Magistrate, though Christian and godly, doth not intend ex natura rei, and in regard of his particular voca∣tion, the glory of Iesus Christ, as Mediatour and King of his Church, and that the end of Magistracy is not godliness
 and honesty, but peace and quietnesse. For these be the words of Mr. Gillespie in his Aarons Rod pag. 187. and 188. much like those pag. 253. where he saith, that in a well-constituted Church, the Magistrate ought not to receive complaints ex∣hibited against a sentence of an Ecclesiasticall Court by the party censured: which lan∣guage I humbly conceive to be rank Popery; for this heresy (if I may call it so,
 because it is the main engine to subvert the doctrine) hath been, and is still, the greatest dividing principle that the world hath ever had: it disunites mens minds and affections; it divides, most absurdly, jurisdictions into spirituall & temporall, lawes into ecclesiasticall and civil; it builds up a magistra∣cy within the dominions of magistrates, independent from them. These erro∣neous tenets I maintain in
 this Book to have set up Popery, and to be the grand mystery of iniquity; and not their broaching of a hun∣dred heresies, which were but consequences and pro∣ducts of that great mystery, and which are very compa∣tible & consistent with the main drift & designe of that mystery; even to set up a ju∣risdiction & a government on earth distinct from that of the Magistrate: whereas the reformation from Pope∣ry,
 which England of all na∣tions hath been most blessed with, is altogether inconsi∣stent with the retaining of that spring-head of the my∣stery of Iniquity, by which powers & jurisdictions are divided, and you the Magi∣strates are removed and dis∣charged from your princi∣pall duty of magistracy; wch is not so much to procure out ward & temporall peace, as eternal happiness, & to make Acts of Parliament, Statutes,
 Lawes, Courts, Armies, Navies, Taxes, Excise, Cu∣stome, punishment of evil doers, subservient to that end. Which duty I hum∣bly conceive to be so much the more incumbent on you, by how much great∣er the power is that God hath put into your hands. This being an undeniable truth, that, where God hath given more power, autho∣rity and opportunity to do good, there also he hath laid
 more obligation and duty. For I dare confidently af∣firm, that all the godly mar∣tyrs and ministers that ever were in England, put toge∣ther, were they so many Bradfords, Latimers, Green∣hams, had not so much obligation laid upon them to promote the interest of Iesus Christ, in setting up his ordinances, as one single woman, Queen Elizabeth, had upon her. So then, right Honourable, I have two
 main tasks upon my hands. One, to root out that divi∣ding principle and remain of Popery amongst us, and to prove that there is no other ecclesiasticall jurisdi∣ction, but that which the spirit of God in the word, by the preaching of the Go∣spell, hath over the con∣sciences of men; when it convinceth and perswadeth them, and brings every thought & affection captive unto the obedience of the
 crosse of Christ. The other task is, to make your power and duty of magistracy in matters of religion sociable with the right libertie, yea independency of churches. For the magistrates are to set up pure ordinances, Mi∣nistery, Schools of learning; to call Synods, and invite all men to join with them in promoting the interest of Iesus Christ: but they are not to constrain any mans freedom, liberty, & choice,
 drawing him to Church perforce, and urging him to embrace rather this Ordi∣nance then that. For as they cannot command grace, so they cannot punish any man for want of grace, or for an errour in judgement: yet they may punish for an errour in practise, if it be a breach of the law of the land: they ought also to re∣strain men from spread∣ing blasphemies and here∣sies, laying that tye upon
 them which the Theodo∣sian Code, l. omnis de haeret. imposeth, ut sibi tantum noci∣tura sentiant, aliis obfutura non pandant, to keep those hurtfull tenets to them∣selves, not to vent them abroad to the infecting of others. All these notions & positions I am confident I can make out so plain, that they shall be obvious to any ordinary understanding; straining neither Scripture nor reason; nor casting the
 mist of grammaticall and scholasticall learning, to keep men off from seeing their way, & discerning the truth; nor loading the mar∣gent with quotations, which draw the minde beside the context. May it please you to pardon this bold address, and uncouth dresse and lan∣guage of a stranger, (and yet no longer a stranger, being by your bounty na∣turalized, and made an En∣glish-man) who in affection
 and zeal to promote the re∣ligion, peace, and wealth of these three Nations, under the protection of his High∣nesse, and to that end to be∣stow his labour & studies, yea his life, will not shew himself inferiour to any Na∣tive. I shall dye with much comfort, if in my life-time I can see some fruit of my la∣bours; as I doubt not but I shall; conjecturing it by the effects that my other labours in this kind have already
 wrought upon mens minds beyond seas, possessed be∣fore with prejudices, both against this subject, and the godly party of this Nation. If your Honours apprehend this to be a truth, I humbly conceive that Gods work, which is also your work, in settling religion, is half done to your hands. For all juris∣diction now streaming from one jurisdiction, even from that of the Soveraign Ma∣gistrate; that religion cannot
 chuse but be well settled, which retaining soundnesse in doctrine, and holinesse in life, is harboured under such a church-government, as hath no clashing with that of the Magistrate. Such, as I humbly conceive, may be established by setting up Overseers and Bishops over Ministers and Churches; with whom if the right of private Churches can but stand, & be kept inviolable, (as no doubt but it may)
 no government can be ima∣gined more preserving con∣formity in doctrine and discipline, & besides banish∣ing all jurisdiction which steps between magistracy & the inward jurisdiction of the spirit of God in the word, over mens minds & hearts; and thereby making all the church-judicatory power more naturally flowing from, and depending upon the Magistrate, and easing him, by this compendious
 way of inspection, by a few good mens eyes, who may have a particular oversight of the affairs of the Church. And thus by such a tempered government, the four par∣ties, namely the Episcopall, the Erastian, the brethren of the Presbytery, and of the Congregationall way, will have a ground for reconci∣liation, & obtain, with some condescension, what every one of them desireth. The Lord make you his instru∣ments
 to make up all breaches among brethren, and to bring to passe what hitherto hath been rather desired then effected;  set∣tling the reformed Prote∣stant religion in the purest way of reformation, and commending your modell and labours therein to other Churches abroad: that as the English Nation for pu∣rity of doctrine, power of godliness, hospitality and bowels of mercy toward
 strangers, & the persecuted members of Christ, hath hitherto gone beyond all the world; so you may be in∣struments to preserve those blessed priviledges, by fur∣ther promoting the interest of Iesus Christ; particularly by clearing and removing the mistakes and misunder∣standings from many of our brethren beyond the seas, who by the suggestions and false informations of some enemies to the people
 of God in this Island, or of friends to Popery, super∣stition and formality, are as ready to misapprehend the wayes of God amongst us, as these are to slaunder them, and to join with them in giving credit, that with the English hierarchy and liturgy, all religion and fear of God is banished out of this Nation; where there is neither Episcopall nor Pres∣byteriall ordination; no uniformity of discipline, yea
 no discipline at all; no ca∣techizing enjoined or per∣formed; no Creed, no De∣calogue, no Lords prayer rehearsed in Churches; nor any Scripture publickly read to the people; nor the Sacrament of the Eucharist constantly administred: thus cloathing what truth there may be in all these, with the cloak of rash and uncharitable construction, as others do cloth it with the cloak of malice and
 lying. I doubt not but that by your piety and wisdom, as you will stop the mouth of slaunder, so you will give no occasion to the Re∣formed and Godly, to con∣ceive amiss of your godly proceedings.
