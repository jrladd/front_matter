Dear Madam,
YOur deceased Husband was pleased that I (amongst ma∣ny others much more worthy then my self) should preach his Funeral Sermon, and now at your request I have published it: Not that I am in the least ambitious of being in Print, but would rather decline it. Madam, I am very sensible of all your civil Favours, yet would much
more willingly have taken another opportunity to express my thank∣fulness then this; but since you were pleased to lay your Commands upon me, I readily submit. I must confess both the matter and method to be plain, and not in the least worth your Acceptance; but I well remember the saying of one that otherwise could speak in an elo∣quent stile, (which was this) That it is better that Gramma∣rians should reprehend us, then that the people should not under∣stand us. This Sermon was prea∣ched principally before a Country Auditory, although I must confess there were many of my Reverend Brethren there, but they were the fewest in number; and I did en∣deavour
to suit my discourse to the most, and not the least of those Re∣verend persons, who understood matters of this nature much better then my unworthy self. Madam, I desire not to exceed the bounds of an Epistle, so as to make the Porch greater then the Building, but in few words to conclude my self,
