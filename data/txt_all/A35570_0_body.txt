SIR,
THERE were two things that influenc'd me in this Dedication: the first, that this little Treatise might have the Honour of venturing abroad into the World, under the Protection of some Guardian Name: the other,

that I my self might have an Op∣portunity of gaining Acquaintance with a Person, whom I have long since Admired and Respected.
The many Useful and Learned Books, you have generously blest the World with, have establish'd to you a just and everlasting Reputa∣tion: especially that excellent Trea∣tise, call'd, The Way to Long Life, Health and Happiness, which I con∣fess, at the very first Reading, ob∣tain'd a double Victory; at once subdu'd my Reason, and engag'd my Affections.
Upon this account, SIR, it is, that I have assum'd the Confidence of placing you at the Front of the ensuing Discourses, not to Intitle you to the Patronage of my Defects and Imperfections; but to Defend and Secure what shall appear Rati∣onal, Useful and Honest, against

the petulant Assaults of those who are least able to Judge: Under the Shield of your Countenance and Approbation, I contemn and de∣spise the Snarling, Impotent Cen∣sures of Ignorant and Invidious Critics.
The Subject Matter of these Es∣says, cannot be strange to You: the whole Stream and Course of your Writings, affording evident and un∣deniable Instances of a true Philoso∣phical Genius, and of no ordinary Proficiency in Mathematical and Astrological Speculations.
If there be any thing advanced in this Attempt, trespassing upon the Humour of establish't Rules and re∣ceiv'd Maxims, it is to be consider'd, that all my Notions are purely Hy∣pothetical, not asserting any thing Positively and Magisterially, but only offering my honest Endeavours,

towards the Improvement or Illustra∣tion of an useful and necessary Science. And I faithfully promise, to renounce every Part of it, that shall be convicted, to intrench up∣on the Priviledge of good Manners and Christianity.
SIR, I shall not further inter∣rupt you in your more Weighty Concerns, but humbly beg leave to submit the Whole to your Perusal, and better Judgment.
SIR,
