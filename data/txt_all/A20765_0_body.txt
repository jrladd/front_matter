HAVING HAD through your ho∣nourable bounty, a part of the Lords Vineyarde allot∣ted vnto mee his most vnwoorthy woorkeman, by your Honour his most woorthy steward, to the end I should plant and water, purge and prune it, I thought it my parte not onely to performe my dutie in this behalfe, in such measure as God
 enableth me, but also to present vn∣to your honour the first fruits of my labor which haue yet offered them∣selues to publike view, to the end that I might thereby both shew my selfe not altogeather negligent in our great Lord and maisters busi∣nesse, and also giue some token of most obliged duty and humble thankefulnesse to you his honoura∣ble steward, by whose appoint∣ment I haue obtained a place wher∣in I may imploy my paynes, wher∣as otherwise I should eyther haue stood idle in the market place, or els beene compelled to haue digged in another mans ground, with great labour & little fruit. If these my first fruits seeme vnpleasant in your most learned and iudiciall taste, ey∣ther impute it to the immaturitie caused by their short time of grouth and small-experienced skill of the vintager, or els consider that they
 are destinated to a physicall vse for the purging away of choller, and therefore though they be not plea∣sant in tast, yet may they be profita∣ble in operatiō. Such as they are (in all humilitie, crauing pardon for my bouldnes) I cōmend them to your honourable patronage and protec∣tion, and your selfe to the Almigh∣ties, most hartily beseching the glo∣rious and great Lord of the vinyard long to continue you his faith∣full steward amongst vs, to the ad∣uancement of his glory, the propa∣gation of his vine, and the excee∣ding comfort of his poore contem∣ned labourers. Amen.
