COurteous Gentlemen, these Canzonets of mine being ended, ac∣cording as my abilitie therein and the leisure allotted mee from other necessary imployments would permit, as now, so long since willingly would they haue offered themselues vnto you to bee pa∣tronized of you, had not the manifold rubs which befell them in their way stayed them hetherto; better now then neuer. The action it selfe of impropriating the first fruits of your protection may per∣haps at the first blush seeme to bee of great boldnesse, but to an indifferent censurer vpon mature deliberation, the trespasse of it will easily appeare to bee but Ueniall if any. For what Aduocate is there (though but tasted of the rudiments of Law) who could not pleade a reasonable excuse for it, if hee were but informed of your industrious trauailing in the liberall Sciences (whereof Musicke is one) with such wil∣lingnesse of minde and delight of heart and with such an ingenious disposition of liking and louing all whose footsteps doe tend the same way with you. And yet that is not all. For these Sonnets of mine, if you mark them well, do seeme to smile vpon you, as challenging some former familier acquaintance with you. And I dare say for them, that if they knew how, they would curteously salute you, and merily relate what a solace their company was once to you, when as being but weake ones I nursed them amongst you. `But if all this were not, yet your louing affections and bountifull kindnesse, which both your worshipfull Parents and your selues, haue from time to time inlarged toward mee, might well enough animate me in crauing your fauourable protection, for whom can a man better trust to, then those of whom he hath had former tryall. Accept therefore I pray you, of these first fruits of my indeuours, accounting it no impeachment to any of you, that so small a thing is made com∣mon to all of you, you are I trust children of the most High, and therefore tyed together by the band of the Spirit, you are all Brethren of the same Parents, and therefore tied toge∣ther by the band of Nature: your education formerly hath beene for the most part toge∣ther, and your place of residence is now in one and the same Vniuersitie, as in a Nursery, and in one and the same place of that Nursery, and therefore you are tyed together by the band of Society: farre be it from me, that I should seeme to go about to separate where they are so worthily knit together. The Lord knit you still surer and surer in loue towards his Maiestie, and one towards another, that you may so liue together on earth, as that one day you may be crowned together with glory in heauen.
