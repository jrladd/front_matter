GENTLEMEN,
I Here present you with the excellen∣cies of the Lord of Praissac, toge∣ther with mine own imperfections.
For the exercising of a Compa∣nie in their postures and motions, and to dispose that (or perhaps a regiment) into va∣rious forms of battalia, as there are divers helps extant (besides your commendable pra∣ctice) so doubtlesse most of you have attained to very good perfection therein: yet I assure my self, your vertuous emulations will not suffer you to stick there, but will kindle a plus oultre in your heroick breasts; especially when you shall here see that you have much more to do, and that a souldiers Gammaut goes farre beyond E-la.
These are times of action, and require eve∣ry true hearted subject to imploy his talent for his Majesties service and the publick safety; If these my poore endeavours may afford but the least furtherance thereunto, and my good intentions receive but a courteous acceptance at your hands, I have my desires; and rest
