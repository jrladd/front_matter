Dear Neighbours,
IT being my design to settle a monthly Sacrament amongst you, beginning from Easter-day now at hand: I cannot satisfy my self, without endeavouring, by all ways in my power, to dispose and prepare you for a constant attendance at it. For which end I send you this little plain Book, which contains the sum of all that is necessary for you to know, and all that I have already Preached to you on this Subject. And I most earnestly beseech, in∣treat and require you, (as you will answer it at the Great Day, when men must give a strict and se∣vere account how they have us'd those means and opportunities of being acquaintd with their Duty which have been offer'd to them, especially by the hands of their Spiritual Teachers and Pastors) to peruse and consider it, with the same seriousness and concern for your Souls, with which, I call God to witness, it was written. And, if it should not reach all your Scruples, and answer all your Difficulties, I beg of you that you will let me know wherein you shall remain unsatisfied, that so I may give you such farther Helps and Directions, as shall appear to be needful. This, as it will show your sincerity
 and honest desire of coming to the knowledge of the Truth, as it is in Christ Jesus, so will it like∣wise be the shortest and surest way of your coming at it; it being impossible, by Writing or Preaching, to give the same exact and speedy resolutions to the doubts and difficulties of particular Persons, as by verbal conferences; wherein they have the satisfa∣ction of puting their Case, and hearing it answered in their own way. May it please God, of his Great Goodness, so to excite, direct and bless your Endeavours, in this, as well as in all Reli∣gious Matters, that you may adorn the Do∣ctrine of God our Saviour in all things, and by so doing, Glorify God, make your calling and election sure; and fulfil the joy of

Feb. the 20th, 1699.
