WHen God this wondrous Creature did create,
This euer-mouing body, this huge weight,
VVhose head, whose lofty head high situate,
Is crown'd with starrs & constellations bright.
Hee causd the same one certaine way to moue,
VVhich moouing (some say) doth sweet tunes beget,
Another way the Sunne and Planets proue,
For they from thence moue where the sun doth set;
Yet he the Pole-star, Cynosura cleere,
Causd steddily to stand, though heauen did gyre,
For an example to mens actions heere:
Madam, you are the starre of his desire;
VVhilst hee his thoughts heauen moues, Ã´ gracious bee,
And wonders in your Creature you shall see.
