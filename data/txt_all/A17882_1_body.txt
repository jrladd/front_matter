TO MY VVORTHY FRIEND, MR. IOHN MOVNSON, Sonne and Heyre to Sir Thomas Mounson Knight and Baronet.
ON you th' affections of your Fathers Friends,
With his Inheritance by right descends;
But you your gracefull youth so wisely guide,
That his you hold, and purchase much beside.
Loue is the fruit of Vertue, for whose sake
Men onely liking each to other take.
If sparkes of vertue shin'd not in you then,
So well how could you winne the hearts of men?
And since that honour and well-suted Prayse
Is Vertues Golden Spurre; let mee now rayse
Vnto an act mature your tender age,
This halfe commending to your Patronage:
Which from your Noble Fathers, but one side
Ordain'd to doe you honour, doth diuide.
And so my loue betwixt you both I part,
On each side placing you as neare my heart.
