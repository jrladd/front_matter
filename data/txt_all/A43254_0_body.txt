Much Honoured and Noble Lord,
HIS Majesty's Proclamation against Immoralities, and the Honourable Houses of Parlia∣ment piously concurring, by some good Laws, to assist and strengthen the Mini∣stry,
in the suppressing of Vice; as it gave me a secret Pleasure, so it did encourage me to frame and preach this following Discourse, and for exposing this Sermon in print to a more publick View. I am not without hopes it may do some good upon such as shall cast their Eye upon it (the Discourse being on an Argument wherein all good Men do agree) but more especially it may let some that are in great Authority see that there are great Lets and Hinderances amongst us as to an universal Reformation of Man∣ners; and some of them are such Lets and Hinderances, as only the Wisdom of the Nation in Parliament can remove.
And I am the more emboldned to make use of Your Lordship's Name, and
to crave Your Patronage, not only upon the account of Your great Honour, emi∣nent Parts, and most agreeable Virtue (whereby You shine amongst our Nobi∣lity, and do attract the Affections of all Good Men) but because great Examples are powerful, and have a mighty Influ∣ence to bear down Vice, and to encou∣rage Goodness, And I am fully per∣suaded Your Lordship will in Your High Place endeavour to promote that Great Design which this Discourse points at, which is, to promote the true and lasting Happiness of our Church and State; and which can be effected by no other means than by making the Almighty God our Patron and Friend, which can only be by depressing Wickedness, and encourag∣ing Piety and universal Goodness.
And upon these accounts it is that I pray for Your Lordship's Health and Happiness in this Life, and Your end∣less Glory hereafter; and shall always approve my self
