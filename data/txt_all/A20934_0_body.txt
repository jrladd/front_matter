SIR,
THIS learned and Ortho∣dox divine hath both at home, and abroad, both in himselfe, and in his profita∣ble and usefull workes gi∣ven
 such Heroick proofes of his owne worth and ex∣quisite learning, that here to goe about to use any en∣comium in his praise and worth would be but to light a candle at the noone day which this Sunne shining in his owne strength would utterly obscure. Hee hath done and said so much to vindicate himselfe from out of the jawes of obscuri∣tie, or oblivion, that no ad∣dition in that kinde is need∣full; and were he herein wanting to himselfe, I would add no other testi∣monie of him in his behalfe,
 then his who well may be instar omnium, namely that of our late reverēd & learned Bishop in his opus∣cula posthuma, where any that would nodum in hoc scirto quaerere, may finde ample satisfacti∣on, so that indeed for my owne part I will onely with the Orator, say, quid opus est verbis ubi rerum te∣stimonia adsunt. In that I have presumed to dedi∣cate this booke thus tran∣slated, and what herein I may call mine, confined in∣deed within the narrow verge of my weake perfor∣mance,
 to your judicious peruse all, grave patronage, and protection, it is out of that assurance, you have gi∣ven all good men of your unfained love of the truth and true religion, that the same may remaine upon re∣cord, for some though but a weake testimonie of that my ever vowed observance and due respect, wherein for your many worthy fa∣vours, I stand so mainely obliged, wherein also being confident of your wonted favour, and good accep∣tance, wherevnto I humbly commend the same, and my
 farther service, I will ever rest
