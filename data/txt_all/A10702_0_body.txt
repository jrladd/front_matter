ALthough I do not thinke these idle lines to be a fit present for your iudg∣ment and wisedome, whome the Arts haue adorned with knowledge and science, but that I shall rather seeme to inioyne you to a pennance, then giue you any manner of content: yet (sir) hauing had former trials of your curtesies towards me, I will number this amongst the rest of your fauours: you see the best gratification my abi∣lity can afford, is but a few paper wordes, and betwixt kind wordes that be written, and kind wordes that bee spoken, the difference is small. I would bee glad to arme them with some better merite, and to endeuour any other thing that might be more acceptable vnto you: in the meane time, I shall acknowledge my selfe more beholding vnto you, to vouchsafe me a reading, then my little skill is able to me∣rite by writing. I will not make any further ostentation, neither will I light a candle to the sunne, but will rest,
