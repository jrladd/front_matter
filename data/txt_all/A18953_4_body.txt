THere's no necessitie that can exclude
the poorest being from a gratitude.
And where the strength of Fortune lends no more,
He that is truly thankfull, is not poore.
Were I to pay this debt to courser men,
I might dispaire; and mine owne fate contemne;
Their satisfaction only liues in things
That profit, or the Golden tribute brings.
But your farre finer soules in Heauen that dwell,
Despise those meaner ends, so neere to Hell.
And for your owne sakes noble actions doe
As well as theirs, they are extended to.


Yours be the bountie then, mine the great debt:
On which no time, nor power can ransome set.
