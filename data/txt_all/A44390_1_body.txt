SIR,
IT is yet a question amongst
Schoole-boyes, and not
likely to be hastily by
them decided, whether K.
Alexander was more bound
to Philip his Father, that begat him, or
his Master Aristotle that instructed
him? for of both he had received
unrequitable Benefits. Should I
therefore not acknowledge that la∣sting
good, which with many co-partners
I obtained by your care
and industry, I should indeed be
worse then ungatefull. And what
token of thankfulnesse can I tender,
more welcome to your self, then this
small Manual, which most nearly
concernes the profession of a Schoole-Master;
a calling which hath all kinde
of good attending it, to make it com∣mendable,
as well as others.

For 1. If we look at the benefit∣ting
of Church and Common∣wealth;
wherein can we better im∣ploy
our time and study, then in
traing up of children to become ser∣viceable
instruments of much good
in both? Nay, should a man but bare∣ly
respect himself, he may finde
it very profitable to augment his
learning, and not a little advanta∣gious
to the increase of his yearely
Revenues.
2. What more pleasing variety
can there be, then that of childrens
dispositions and fansies? what better
Recreation, then to read and dis∣course
of so many sundry subjects,
as we meet with in ordinary Au∣thours?
Besides, the delight which
is to be taken by our Scholars ready
progresse in a constant even way,
will far exceed all care and toyle
that can be bestowed in helping
them to profit.
3. Should I goe about by those
millions of Arguments that con∣curre

(as Voluntiers) to maintain
the lawfulnesse of this calling, as
commanded by God, continued in
all ages, practised by the well-learned
and truly vertuous, com∣mended
by all good men, maintain∣ed
and encouraged by most noble
Princes, and religiously disposed
people; opposed onely by the ene∣mies
of Gods truth, and most dise∣steemed
by persons that are altoge∣ther
(for want of breeding) either
debauched, or ignorant. I might
write a larger Volume, and to lesser
purpose.
Ob. But alas, we that wholly un∣dergoe
the burden of School-teach∣ing,
can tell by our own experience,
how laborious it is both to minde
and body, to be continually intent
upon the work, and how irksome it
is (especially to a man of a quiet
temper) to have so many unwilling
provocations unto passion; what
good parts for learning, and right
qualification in all points of beha∣vour

is required of us; how small
our yearly stipend is, and how un∣certain
all our other incomes are.
Again, we call to minde the too
much indulgency of some Parents,
who neither love to blame their
childrens untowardnesse, nor suffer
the Master to correct it; we remem∣ber
their generall ingratitude for
the Masters well-doing, and their
open clamour for his least doing
amisse; we observe their common
indiscretion in wholly imputing the
Scholars lesse profitting to the Ma∣sters
more neglect, and their happy
thriving to their own onely toward∣linesse;
not to mention their fond
Ambition, in hastening them too
fast. Besides, the small account
which the vulgar have, the too cen∣sorious
eye which the more judici∣ous
cast, and the slight regard
which our young Academians (for
the most part) carry towards a poor
Schoole-Master, make us sometimes
judge our calling (as many do) too

mean for a Scholar to undertake,
or desire to stick too many yeares.
We let passe childrens imperfections
and untowardnesse, which are in∣deed
our daily torture; so that we
could rather wish, our selves might
leave our charge, then advise any
friends we have to undertake it.
Answ. These we must acknow∣ledge
are very great discourage∣ments,
yet such as attend a most ne∣cessary
calling, and therefore must
with Fortitude be conquered, or re∣solutely
undergone. Should the
Mariner, because of danger, the
Husband-man because of toyle, the
Souldier because of hardship, the
Magistrate because of interruption,
the Minister, because of many mens
disordered conversations, abandon
their professions; it would then
fare with a State, as (the Tale saith)
it did once with the body, when
the whole pin'd away, because no
member would discharge its proper
function.

Neither can I say to whom I
should more properly dedicate this
Subject, then to your selfe, who have
now (as I suppose) for at least fifty
yeares together, and with general
applause, performed the Taske of a
Schoole-Master, notwithstanding
much opposition, and many discou∣ragements
of every kinde; who
have had continually in your charge
many scores of Scholars, and have
yearly sent abroad, both to Trades,
and Universities, great store of such
as have been thorowly accomplished
in their places. Nay, (give me leave
to speak it) to commend your
knowne Dexterity in this excellent
calling, there have been (I think)
as many, and those, as well-ap∣proved
Schoole-Masters your quon∣dam
Scholars, as have been trained
up by any one man in England.
Amongst others I help onely to fill
up the number, who have some∣times
in publick, and sometimes in
private, for nigh thirty years toge∣ther,

been exercised in teach∣ing
Scholars, and have at last for
mine own ease, and the satisfaction
of some friends, printed what Me∣thod
and Order you once saw I had
writ out, and which upon your ap∣probation,
and my own further ex∣periment,
I have thought meet to
observe constantly, reserving ever
the liberty of varying in matters of
of circumstance, as occasion shall re∣quire.
And for some things (it may
be) you may rightly say (as I am
ever bound most thankfully to ac∣knowledge,
that I was your Scholar,
seeing in them I have so nearly
seemed to track that method, ac∣cording
to which I was instructed by
your self.
Daigne (I beseech you) to accept
this small offer of a willing minde,
and if you finde it helpful to you or
yours, in any kinde, to use it freely;
where you shall espie the least de∣fect,
I hope you will please to cen∣sure
it with impartial mildenesse▪

This Petition also I prefer to them
of better judgement, as it happeneth
to come into their hands.
The Lord continue you long in
your eminent place, to doe the
Church and Common-wealth most
acceptable service, and to reap to
your self much comfort thereby,
that when at last you shall have fini∣shed
your course, you may receive
at Gods hands an immortal Crown,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
in whom I rest
