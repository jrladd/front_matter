SIR,
I Would not imitate those Au∣thors who fly fo Protection to Persons that are unable, or un∣willing to grant it. Your Love for Learning prompting You to countenance the Well-meant Endea∣vours of Studious Men, You have condescended to extend Your Fa∣vours even to me. This, SIR, made me so presumptuous as to relish no other Method of owning the Debt I cannot pay, and at the same time prepossessing the Reader in my Fa∣vour, than by dedicating this Transla∣ion of the best Work of France's geatest Wit to You, who have made he Copy of the Master-piece of one

of Italy's best Historians outshine the beautiful Original. For, what∣ever my Performance be, most Rea∣ders will as little doubt its being good, because offer'd to so great a Judge, as they would be apt to mistrust a Child's Legitimacy, to whom they saw a Man of Nice Ho∣nour stand Godfather. Indeed, as Those who have no Children may be thought more oblig'd to be thus Trustees for those of others, and make amends for not begetting any; so Those whose Pens produce nothing, seem more engag'd to take care of the Offspring of other mens Brains, than those whose fertile Minds, like Yours, are like to people the learned World with manly and charming Productions. Yet this do's not ex∣cuse the latter from appearing in Behalf of those who stand in need of their charitable good Word, when usher'd in to the World. Besides, as He who never had any Progeny is less likely to secure a good Fame to that of others, than a Person whose honourable Offspring evinces his Ca∣pacity

for such a Christian-like Of∣fice; so he who never writ can hard∣ly so effectually save a Book from Damnation, as one who having en∣rich'd the Public with valuable Pie∣ces, is acknowledg'd a competent Judge in the matter. Till Occasion calls, and You consent to leave the Study of the best Ancients and Mo∣derns, to devote Your Self wholly to what You love more than Your Ease, I mean Your Country, it hopes, SIR, to be oblig'd to You for such Presents, the Product of the hours, that divide those during which You either bless Your Friends with Your Conversation, or Your Self with that of a Consort, whose outward Graces are attended with all the Beauties of the Mind. May Your Happiness, like Your Vertues, admit of no Allay; Be still the Joy of a Noble Father, who doubly lives, while he sees the Heir to his Ho∣nours, already like himself, adorn'd with the most essential Nobility, when he sees in You so ripe a Judg∣ment, so calm and sedate a Mind, in

so flourishing a Youth, so universal a Learning without any Tincture of Affectation or Pedantry, so great a Knowledge of the World without the least Acquaintance with its Vi∣ces; and, above all, so charming a Modesty, that Vertue which shuns a Lustre, yet heightens that of every other. But that Darling of Yours causes me to draw a Veil over those other Accomplishments, which, as they endear You to all Mankind, would have made me ambitious of owning my self Your Admirer, tho I were not otherwise bound to pro∣fess my self with all imaginable Zeal and Respect,
SIR,
