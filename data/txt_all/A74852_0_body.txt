Right Worshipfull,
DEsires are the truest effigies of the mind: If a man be Heavenly, he hath heavenly desires; if out∣ward things terminate his desires, he hath but an earthly mind, and no more then what Paul calls the spirit of the world:1 Cor. 2.12 Such mens desires the Psalmist speaks of, when he saith, Who will shew us any good, that is, matter of gain, and profit?Isa. 26.8. But the godly mans desire is thus set forth,Psal. 73.23. The desire of our soul is to∣wards thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. There is none that I desire upon earth, besides thee. The worldlings desire is to live many dayes and years upon earth: the godly mans desire, that Christ may be in him, while he is here;Luk. 12.29. and that he may be with Christ, when he departs hence: and these (as Paul himself deter∣mines) are the best desires: Worldly desires at last give no satisfy∣ing content to a mans soul; but, these are satisfying desires: those are oft frustrated, and come to nothing: but of these it is said, God will fulfill the desire of them that fear him. When a whole Kingdome is in a shaking condition, the desires of many must needs fail; Heb. 12.28. but the Christians desire is upon a Kingdome that cannot be shaken. My end and aim in sending abroad this Sermon, is to 01
increase these holy desires in as many as shall read it. It is but a plain and unpolisht piece: such as it is I present it to your hands, as a small return of thankfullnesse for those many favours I have re∣ceived from you; hoping it will find the better acceptance, because I have known you many years, and that your desires are set on the best things: Praying for your prosperity, and for all that have re∣lation to you, I rest
