Reverend and welbeloved,
THese uncharitable times have made a breach in our ho∣ly Communion, a separation of me from the acquain∣tance of some of you, because I dare not serve them: insomuch that I may say with the Prophet, I am be∣come a stranger unto my Brethren, my lovers and friends stand afarre off, they will not know me; 'tis counted a prime note of a Malignant to be seene speaking to me, and yet (you know) I have beene some body heretofore, as well as some of you: O but the report goes, I am now growne an Apostate; and why so? because I am (still the same man) obstinate in my way, will not con∣forme to the example of such and such of my worthy Brethren, preach to promote the warre (as they call it) for the Parliament. Sirs, I am a Minister of the Gospell of Peace, and 'tis against my calling and my conscience to doe so, the Kings expresse command also being to the contrary: I may loose my credit, mine outward estate, the comfort of wife and children (as I have already done,) yea and my life too, which
 is (in mercy) yet preserved; but I am resolved by Gods grace to keep my Conscience; the enemy shall not spoile me of that, let him doe his worst. Truly (friends) I must confesse, like you, I have alwayes loved my credit well (and perhaps too well) with the people; but when my Saviours truth conjoyned with my Soveraignes honour came in question, I was glad I had loved it so well, and kept it intire till then, to sacrifice in that quarrell. What I am, you know; and what my Doctrine and conversation hath beene: Had it beene formerly bad, my selfe in these times had fared better, for I was plainly told at the beginning of my troubles, that I must suffer the punishment of an hun∣dred knaves, because being an honest man, I did more hurt to the cause then so many: which since then I have found true, be your selves the Judges, and say, whether you know any in these Counties that were marked for scandalous, lazy, or superstitious, and complained of, as such, that have suffered in any measure so much as I: first heare, and then determine.
The Apostle sayes, Receive not an accusation against an Elder, but by the testimony of two or three witnesses, yet upon the bare informati∣on of one malicious varletOne Samuel rrowes, some nes of Col∣ester, brother  Master Bur∣wes the Mi∣ster. (whom many of you know to be most notorious for false swearing, publicke drunkennesse, and blasphemy, for which the last yeare at the publicke Sessions he was bound to his good behaviour:) I was voted a Delinquent by some of the Mem∣bers of the House of Commons, and published in a Diurnall over the Nation, to preach such foolish stuffe, which none (I hope) that know me, suspect of me: hereupon being sent for by a Messenger, and com∣mitted to custody, I was at last referred to the Committee for scanda∣lous Ministers, that so I might afterward be reckoned in that number, and disabled thereby from doing Christ any more service: (for a Minister marked with that badge by them (they call the Parliament) is more odious then he that is made such a one by sinne or Satan:) so that when I returned home, the drunken Crew (whose vicious lives I had oft inveighed against) and their children too; would point at me as I went in the streets, and say, there goes a scandalous Minister, there goes he that was in the Gaole, with his fellow Rogues the o∣ther day.
After this, when by Master Marshall's friendship and testimony of me, I obtained to put in Baile, I was forced to make many journeys
 this last winter-time to London (being almost forty miles from mine habitation) for preaching against Lying and Slandering, Pride and Ma∣lice, sinnes notorious in my neighbours, who had now got the tricke (because all was beleeved against me which they said) to affirme, that what-ever I preached was against the Parliament, so making that and their owne sinnes all one, (for that indeed was able to doe me more hurt then they:) and though I never failed upon the least intimation to appeare, yet I was sent for againe by a Pursevant, (as if I had not beene bailed) because that was most chargeable, whereby a great part of that little money which in ten yeares space I had saved to keepe my wife and children (if I should die) was expended.
And now at last when it was perceived, that neither by threats, nor molestations, nor charges, nor weary journies, I would be forced to deny the truth of God, my debauched adversary (knowing as should seeme the intentions of his powerfull friends) layed wagers, that he would quite put me by from preaching, and turne me out of my Li∣ving; wherefore having forced many of my simple people to make a purse to beare his charges, (by threatning them else with plundering, and the imputation of being counted Cavaliers) he repaires againe unto London, and on the third of March in the name not onely of the Commons, but also of the Lords, (before whom I never appeared, nor was ever summoned) hee obtained a Sequestration to be granted to some others, (my deadly enemies of his owne knot) to seize upon my Parsonage-House, Glebe, and Tythes, and a power withall to appre∣hend my person to doe with me God knowes what: And (as the words of the Sequestration are) for the better supply of an able and god∣ly man in the Church, they sent downe a stranger to officiate as Parson in my place, whom they call a godly, learned, and orthodox Divine, intimating thereby unto the world, that he whom they cast out was not to be accounted any such a one: what I am or have beene (my Christian friends) I referre to your judgements who have knowne me; I thanke God I am able to say with the Apostle, I have walked in all good conscience both before God and man unto this day; I have constantly preached twice upon the Lords day, and oft on Holydayes when I could intreat my people to come to Church: But if that their godly, learned, and orthodox Divine be such a one as is their Lecturer, whom in despight of me they did (in the beginning of my troubles)
 set up to preach against Gods truth, and me in mine owne Church, I thinke they will have (amongst them that are wise and godly) but little credit by him.
Concerning which LecturerOne Lemuell Tuke. some of you (my Christian friends) did at first conceive and say of him, that had he beene good, the barren Country from whence he came would not have parted with him: in briefe by education he is a Weaver, of no University, yet one that hath a charge of soules in Notttinghamshire, from which ever since the Par∣liament began, he hath beene a constant Non-resident, for his Parish then framed a Bill against him to the House of Commons, articling him to be negligent, and insufficient in his place, to be guilty of Barrettry and Battery, to be famed of Drunkennesse, Whoredome, and divers o∣ther such (as they are now accounted in some) small offences; upon which he fled the Country into our parts, and being more suteable to the temper of my people then I am, they made choice of him: among whom he blasphemeth Gods holy Word, preacheth Sedition and Re∣bellion, telleth in the Pulpit many foolish lyes and ridiculous tales, bawleth against the Reverend and Learned Ministers of the Country, and raileth upon the Worshipfull Gentry; and so many wayes hee poysoneth the soules of them that are committed to my Cure, which is my greatest griefe of all. But the Lord I hope will not lay to the charge of his poore persecuted Minister the dammage that is thus done unto the spirits of his people; for God himselfe knoweth that I offe∣red the Chaire-man of the Committee (my drunken Adversaries fast friend) to keepe a Lecture my selfe on the weeke day, if any did desire it, rather then have my flocke defiled with such seditious and wicked Doctrines, as I knew that Lecturer would teach among them. My re∣verend Brethren and friends, some of you thought me much abused by the intrusion of him: I doubt not but you thinke me in your hearts more wronged now, by being after all those former troubles turned out of my Living, my Wife, Children, and aged Parent exposed to the wide world, and my selfe forced to seeke safety in strange places by flying: but blessed be God yet, my flight was not in the Winter.
Sed quid mali feci, What Law of God or man is it that I have bro∣ken, which doth expose me to these miseries? O that some would dis∣cover unto me my transgressions, for as yet I am (to my knowledge) a Delinquent, upon no other ground then the bare accusation and word
 of my enemy: when ten of my neighbours sufficiently furnished with evill affections, were sent for up against me, they were not able to speake me culpable in any thing, save in the matter of my God; and when I urged them before the Committee and spectators, to say, whe∣ther they ever heard me speake word of evill against the Parliament in publicke or private, they could not say it; nor deny, but I constant∣ly prayed for it; onely my chiefe adversary said in behalfe of himselfe and the rest, We thinke that in his preaching he meant the Parliament; and because my enemies did thinke so, some of the Members (as it should seeme) did thinke so too; whose thoughts (in such a case) 'tis not comely for me to gain-say.
I dealt ingenuously before the Committee, relating the truth of what I had preached, (although I might easily suspect, that some pas∣sages in regard of the malignity of the times, might prove to my dis∣advantage) with which my candor and plainnesse divers honourable Members of the Committee were so well pleased, that they concluded to have me reported to the House as a man deserving their favour: but as appeares, (unknowing I beleeve to them in particular) some o∣thers did intend, and have now done otherwise; for five moneths after (as if I had never answered at all) thisThe Copy of which Seque∣stration is at the end of this Booke. Sequestration against me comes forth, wherein are some expressions alleadged (that I should use in those my Sermons) as the cause of this my punishment, which are now shewne up and downe to justifie the pretended equity of the same; but they are so false and so foolish, that I need not confute them to you that know me: or indeed, were they all true of me, I beleeve you would say, if you durst speake, that my penalty exceeds my sinne.
In the seven first Sections of this following Discourse, which is the pith of some 8 Sermons preached in the moneths of June and July last, when my Troubles first begun, you shall see the truth of God which I suffer for: and that you may not tax mee of folly for preaching this truth, at this time when 'tis so much discountenanced, I will breifely tell you the occasion that moved mee to't.
I conceived that the House of Commons (when they set forth the Protestation) did foresee, that the Doctrine established in this Church of England, The Kings Person, Honour, and estate, the Power and Privi∣ledge of Parliament, were or would be in some speciall danger, or
 dammage, now more then formerly they had beene, and therefore did thereby provide that we should ingage our selves to defend them: and for my part I was reall in what I did, having taken the same I truly en∣deavoured in my calling to keepe it; and therefore when I saw people inclining to rebellion and strife, I declared that, to be rather the doctrine of Antichrist and Popery, then of the Church of England, which taught peace and commanded patience: this presently purcha∣sed me the suspicion, and soone after the name of a Malignant: Se∣condly, hearing men unreverently speak of the Kings Majesties person, I opposed that blasphemy by Gods Word, and endeavoured to main∣taine his Honour according to my duty and Protestation: this produ∣ced mee the title of a Royallist, yea of a ranke Cavaleer, and I should have a Buffe Coat and a Scarlet paire of Hose bought mee presently to make mee compleat. And then Secondly observing people on their owne heads, rending Common prayer bookes, and altering things esta∣blished by Law, I inveighed against those doings, as injurious to the power and priviledge of Parliament, which by my protestation also, I was bound to maintaine; and this (they said) discovered mee to be a plaine Papist, one that loved the Masse booke better then I did God: so there I had preached away my good name, but my comfort was I had two witnesses: God, and my owne Conscience, which would ju∣stify me in my way: sed Hinc dolor, hinc Lachrimae.
But further (for I will confesse all against my selfe,) I have beene charged, to have beene a great Hinderer of the Parliament proceedings in the Association, and gathering money in that well affected County of Essex: if I have, 'tis more by my Sufferings then any other way, and if God please to make me an Instrument to prevent sin in others, though by mine owne sorrowes, I will rejoyce in my tribulations: I confesse my Scandalous Adversaries have added some fame and credit to my sufferings, as well as mine owne Innocency, and their malice is the more observed with wonder, at their successe and favour with some Members in the House of Commons: because some six weekes before they complained of me to them, divers of these my persecuting neigh∣bours (whereof the debauched Drunkard was one) had convented me before the Justice of peace, for omitting the Crosse and Surplice, ur∣ging the worthy Gentleman (to his admiration) to inflict the penalty of the statute upon mee for the same, when as notwithstanding at that
 time in other places to other persons, they did raile upon mee for u∣sing the Common prayer booke at all, which soone after they rent in peeces.
And lastly, another reason of this my usage hath beene alleadged by a Member of the House to be this: The King (saies he) turnes out those Ministers that be for the Parliament, and we must provide for them, and how should we so do, but by turning out those that be for the King? but I beleeve His worship was misinformed of His Majesty, for unto that day I cannot yet heare (though I have inquired) that the King had sequestred any living, or turned any Minister out: perhaps some whose Consciences accused them for preaching treason and se∣dition, did run away when His Majesties forces approached: and in pity to the peoples soules so forsaken some might be appointed by His Majesty to preach unto them.
But such wrongs upon such grounds, unto the Kings Subjects that are peaceable and loyall, will make men see and beleeve what hath beene foretold them by their Soveraigne; and to further that worke, had I another Living (I hope) I should be content to loose it.
And now (my Christian Brethren and friends) you have heard also the reasons of my trouble & persecution, judge in your secret thoughts betweene mee and my enemies. I hope I never gave occasion of scan∣dall to the godly wise, I am ready to give an account of my whole faith: I tooke occasion from a conference with Master Marshall, to publish my judgement in the case for which I suffer, that I might give satisfaction to you all, and that you might see, I have some rea∣son for my dissent from him, and some others of my brethren; I dedi∣cate it as to him in particular, so to you all in generall: from whose hands I begge foure things:
1. That you would not thinke the worse of that High and Honou∣rable Court of Parliament for any of my sufferings, nor interpret that any word in these succeeding Sections, is intended against the same: I have professed before it, and so I do now to you, and to the world, that next to Christ, and the King, I judge my selfe bound in duty to endeavour the honour of it: I neither do, nor dare in conscience attribute the wrong that hath beene done mee, to the major part of that part which is now sitting; onely this I say, some particular mem∣bers, (who as men) being seduced by ill Counsell have beene the In∣struments
 of my unkind neighbours thus to abuse mee, whose sinne God pardon, and whose hearts God in mercy turne.
2. That you would beare in mind, that this publication of my faith & judgement in the case, is the Consequent of my troubles, indeed oc∣casioned by them; for I have suffered and therefore do I speake; this I re∣quest; to the end you might be witnesses for me, if afterward out of these following lines somewhat should be picked, wrested, and allea∣ged as the cause of my sufferings; for I observe, that 'tis the custome of these times by doing wrong to urge men to complaine, and then from their expressions to get some colour for their former evill doing against them; when my selfe did first appeare before the Committee my charge was, onely of a Sermon preached the Lords day after I had beene voted a Delinquent.
3. That you would not thinke my present flight to be a relinqui∣shing of the cause, I never balked to appear upon the least intimations, untill now that power was put into the hands of my raging Enemies, which (for ought I know, was to kill mee;) indeed it was threatned before (as was evidenced upon oath) before a Justice, that I should be cut off, as not being fitting to live; whereupon I went to that Member, who was the Cheife instrument of my trouble, and desired of him that I might be brought rather to suffer for this cleare truth of God in pub∣licke, as the Martyrs in Queene Maries dayes did (which I hoped God would enable me to endure, that I might glorify him by my death) then be murdered in private, as I was threatned; he indeed made a tush at mee, and said there was but one man that had said it: But I am by Gods grace of the same minde still, when ever I may in publicke give testimony to this truth of God, I will not keepe in secret.
4. My Christian friends I desire of you in the last place, that I may not fare the worse at your hands, because I have fared so ill at the hands of others, the world's custome is, to judge of men according to it's owne usage of them, though Christ was more afflicted then other men. The Apostle tels us that to you is given not onely to beleeve, but al∣so to suffer; and if God gives suffering grace, he will surely send afflicti∣ons for the exercise of it; indeed the times are evill, but we must not say so: seculo premimur gravi, quo scelera regnant, the world goes ill when sin reigneth; but remember, non est ad astra mollis è terris via. through many tribulations we must go to Heaven, & invisa nunquam
 imperia retinentur diu, this world will not last alwaies, egrediemur tan∣dem, we shall be freed from all our sorrowes at the last, the merits of Christ will make amends for all: and in the meane time if the example of these my sufferings may any way be serviceable unto you my Chri∣stian friends, I shall rejoice the more in them: I am not mine owne, I am Christs, nay I am yours by Christs appointment, who hath ordai∣ned his poore Minister (blessed be his name) not onely to preach the crosse of Christ unto you, but also to carry it before you. I beg all your prayers for strength from him, to whom I commend all you, even to our onely wise and omnipotent God, who will turne all things in the end to our everlasting good, to whom be praise and glory for ever. Amen,
 March 28. 1643.
