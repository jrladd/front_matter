DEarely Beloved in the Lord, I present these things to your view; that you may see in a briefe Conference the summe of that Doctrine, which (through the grace of God) I haue taught and you belee∣ved. I confesse you have cause to say, that you have heard many things
from me, which are not here mentio∣ned: Yet this you will witnes on my behalf, that here is nothing set down which you have not before heard. I have in this present discourse imita∣ted the Geographer, who intending to describe a large Countrey in a small Map, contenteth himselfe to set down the chiefe Towns, and let the smal∣ler Villages, passe without any men∣tion. Thus have I (being to draw the substance of 10 yeares Sermons into a few lines) contented my selfe, with the Description of the most materiall and fund∣mentall Doctrines, which I have de∣livered unto you. And this I have done, not only to testifie my unfained love, which I beare unto you, and my ardent desire that your soules
may prosper. But also to signifie unto the World, that I am ready to give an account of my Faith, and to defend my Doctrine (against all opposers) from such clamors and aspersions as have been always laid upon it, But especially when I delivered this Ser∣mon, which you have seene already. And I am confident I shall be able to do this, through the grace of God, given unto me, by your ardent pray∣ers to God for me, that utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth boldly, and declare the mystery of the Gospell, to his glory, and your consolation. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
