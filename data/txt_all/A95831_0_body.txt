SIR,
HAD not your Pen awaked the evil spirit of the Pasquillers of this Age, and also given Sail to the wishes of such that would have the Justice and Innocency of our Law to have no safe retreat for it self & its honest professors from their debase∣ments: I should not have ventured up∣on so early a Remedy against your Books getting esteem in the world: for I am told, that it is better and safer to meet a danger when it first moves to∣wards us, then to encounter it in its nearer approaches; every step and pro∣gress it makes, rendring it more invin∣cible, and them more unsafe that with∣stand it; especially if the danger be se∣conded with the hurrying swindge of such men as will do a thing, because they will do it, and have not other rea∣son for what they do: I am sorry you
should open so wide a Casement for evil men to see the face and complexion of your spirit, as to our Law, which (you may assure your self) is not so clear and serene from the spots of mistakes and ir∣regularities, as I could wish his were who hath done so much service to the Parliament as you have done: If I make a severer construction of your meaning then you intended, you may rather thank your own words, which made so false a report of your sense and meaning to my understanding, then blame me, who could not find out a better Index of the spirit and reason of what you proposed. Had I been to deal with an adversary to the Common Cause we both have adhered to, I assure you I should have treated and handled him in a rougher accent, if I had had the like advantage as I have against you: I hope therefore you will be satisfied, that this answer is not out of disrespect to you, but out of ne∣cessity to justifie that which is good and innocent, against which you writ,
because you have heard ill of it, and not because you know experimentally in it those mischiefs which you propose to be reformed. I am
