MADAM,
THIS Eminent Saint, now in Glory, having been sixteen Years your Soul guide, to the eternal Advantage of your self, and dearest Relations, and your House being (as it were) the Sanctuary for Divine Worship, for the spreading of Religion through the Country. This can∣not but render his Memory to you pre∣cious; and you may expect, that as they had the Benefit of his Ministry from your House, they should receive the Memoirs of it from your Hands. I make no A∣pology at all for what's In the Narra∣tive, but only for what's left out. I am (perhaps) so needlesly scrupulous of offending any, that (perhaps) I may even∣tually please none. Be it so. 'Tis Spiritual Profit I aim at, if I can but hereby pro∣voke
 and encourage to what is deservedly imitable: I gain my point. I shall say nothing particularly to your self; should I speak any good of you, though never so true, 'twould look like Flattery, which I abhor; and to speak ill of you (with Truth) is beyond the Power of your most captious Enemies (if you have any such.) Go on therefore, as you have begun, pra∣ctically to remember the sound Doctrine, and Non-such Example set before you; which is beyond any thing that can be said, or done by me: I shall always add my poor Prayers, that in so doing, you and yours may be blessed in both Worlds. Though this may by some be accounted the least: Yet this is really the most that can be done by
Madam,
