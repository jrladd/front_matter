SIR,
IT is now some ten years since, that to gratifie a
friend of mine in the Country, I began to inter∣pret
this Parallel; but other things interven∣ing,
it was lay'd aside, and had so continu'd with∣out
thoughts of reasumption, had not the passi∣on
of my worthy Friend Mr. Hugh May
to oblige the Publick, and in commiseration of
the few assistances which our Workmen have of this nature (com∣par'd
to what are extant, in other Countries) found out an ex∣pedient,
and by procuring a most accurate Edition of the Plates,
encourag'd me to finish what I had begun; and to make a will∣ing
Present of my labour and of whatever else I was able to con∣tribute
to so generous a designe.
Sir, I am not to instruct you in the merits and use of this ex∣cellent
Piece; but it is from your approbation and particular in∣fluence,
that our Workmen ought to esteem it, and believe me too
when I affirme it: That the Ten Authors in this Assembly, which
compose both so many, and (for not being vulgar) unintelligi∣ble
Volumes, will neither afford them so full instructions in the
Art, nor so well inable them to judg, and pronounce concerning
the true Rules and Maximes of it as this one little, but incom∣parable,
Collection. You well know, that all the mischiefs and ab∣surdities
in our modern Structures proceed chiefly from our busie
and Gotic triflings in the Compositions of the Five Orders; and
that an able Workman, who is Master of his Art, and has a true
relish indeed, carries on all his undertakings with applause and
satisfaction: That there is not in the whole Catalogue of Authors
who have Written on this Subject, a more safe, expedite and per∣fect
guide than this Parallel; where, from the noblest Remaines
of Antiquity accurately Measur'd, and perspicuously Demon∣strated,
the Rules are lay'd down; and from a solid, judicious,
and mature comparison of modern Examples, their Errours are de∣tected;
so that were but a little more pains taken by our young
Architects and their Subsidiaries, about the easier Principles of Ge∣ometrie,
the Rudiments of Perspective, and a ready address of well
Designing, we might by the conversation of this Author alone,
promise our Country, and the Age to come, a miraculous improve∣ment
of their Buildings in a short time. Nor would this be in
the least, to the augmentation of their expenses; since there is
nothing costs dearer, and displeases more, than our undigested
contrivances, and those intolerable defects which we have enu∣merated.
It is from the asymmetrie of our Buildings, want of
decorum and proportion in our Houses, that the irregularity of our
humors and affections may be shrewdly discern'd: But it is from
His Majesties great Genius, and the choice he has made of such
an Instrument, that we may hope to see it all reform'd; it being in
so worthy an imitation of that magnificent Emperour, that touch'd
with the like indignation at the Encroachments and Deformities of
the publick Edifices and Waies, caused a like reformation also;
so as we may now affirme of London, as the Poet once of Rome,
Nunc Roma est, nuper magna taber∣na
fuit.Abstulerat totam temerarius inst∣tor urbem,
Inque suo nullum limine limen erat.
Iussisti tenues Germanice, crescere vicos;
Et modo quae fuerat semita, facta via est.
Nulla catenatis pila est praecincta lagenis;
Nec Praetor medio cogitur ire luto.
Stringitur in densa nec coeca novacu∣la turba,
Occupat aut totas nigra popina vias
Tonsor, Caupo, Coquus, Lanius sua limina servant.
Nunc Roma est, nuper magna ta∣berna fuit.
Mart. Lib. 7. Epig. 60.
that it now begins to have the face of a Ci∣tie
indeed. And truely it is an improve∣ment
so extraordinary which it has re∣ceiv'd
since His Majesties gracious influ∣ence
upon it, that should I have been si∣lent
of His praises, I might justly appre∣hend
mox lapides clamaturos, that the very
Stones would cry out and become vocal:
But neither here must I forget what is a∣lone
due to you Sir for the reformation of
a thousand deformities in the Streets, as by
your introducing that incomparable form
of Paving,The particulars of that reformati∣on in Rome so much resembling what His Majesty has commanded for the cleansing, and enlarging the Streets, the demolition of Bulks, and other Obstacles, that the whole Epigram merits the ap∣plication. to an incredible advantage of
the Publick; when that which is begun in
Holborn shall becom universal, for the sa∣ving
of Wheels and Carriages, the cure of
noysom Gutters, the deobstruction of En∣counters,
the dispatch of Business, the clean∣ness
of the Way, the beauty of the Object, the ease of the Infirme, and
the preserving of both the Mother and the Babe; so many of the
fair-Sex and their Off-spring having perish'd by mischances (as I
am credibly inform'd) from the ruggedness of the unequal
Streets, &c.
But I know not Sir, how these Instances may be relish'd and
valu'd amongst the vulgar, nor am I much solicitous; sure I am,
that more has been done for the Ornament and Benefit of the Pub∣lick
in two years time, that your Self, with the Cōmissioners who
undertook the Inspection, have acted, then in five hundred before:
They were not a foolish or impolitick People, who from the very
Principles of humanitie, destin'd for the ease of their Subjects, so
many spacious Waies, cool Fountains, shady Walks, refreshing
Gardens, and places of publick Recreation, as well as stately Tem∣ples,
and Courts of Iustice, that Religion and the Laws might be
published with the more pomp and veneration: And if his Ma∣jesty,

with your pains and industry, hath contributed to something
of all this, it is that for which the whole Nation becomes obli∣ged;
as the promoting of such publick and useful Works (and
especially that of Building) a certain Indication of a prudent
Government, of a flourishing and happy People: So that if there re∣main
but one thing more to be desir'd in order to the Consummation
of its perfect felicity; how infinitely were it to be wished, that
whilest the beautie and benefit of the City increased in one part, the
Deformity and apparent Ruine of it might cease on the other: But
this we are to hope for, when, to bring this monstrous Body into
shape, and scatter these ungovernable enormities, either the re∣straint
of Building irregularly shall polish the Suburbs, or (which
I rather could wish) some royal Purchase contract and demolish
them. But Sir, I have done, and I know you will pardon this
Zeal, and accept of this expression of my profound respects from
SIR,
