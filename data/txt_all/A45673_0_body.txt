Right Honourable,
NEver was such a Mite presump∣tiously
offered as this Trifle,
to Your Honors Patronage: But
having once Intituled it a Loyal Sermon,
I knew not where more seeurely to shel∣ter
it, than under Loyalty it self. Your
Honors known Modesty could never yet
endure large Encomiums, which are also
unsuitable Prefaces for a Religious Di∣scourse,

nor can I give an account of any
secret Impulse of Nature, except your
Powerful Name, in relation to my Lord
Bishop of Winchester, with your Train
of attractive Virtues, that hath ever se∣cretly
inclined my heart more peculiar to
your Honors Service than any other Per∣son
whatsoever. I have endeavoured my
utmost, what will best agree with your
Loyal thoughts, to keep my self (as close
as possible) within the Method of his
Majesties excellent Declaration, account∣ing
it far beneath the sence of Honor,
to write after an Enemies Pattern, either
bitter Invectives, or, if in my Power,
Characters of Blood, so humbly Addressing
my hearty Zeal for my King and Countrey,
better beseeming your Protection than an
Elegance or softness of Style. I take leave
with my Fervent Prayers to God for a

farther Discovery of this Fanatick Plot,
with all imaginable success on your Loyal
endeavours, and the other his Majesties
Honourable Deputy-Lieutenants of this
Western Division of Sussex, perchance
for its bigness more fruitful of such great
Examples, than any other Spot within his
Majesties Dominions,
