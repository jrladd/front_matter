Sir
IT is too apparently visi∣ble, how it hath plea∣sed our only wise good God, to suffer this poi∣sonously infected Cup of heart-dividing di∣stractions, to be generally and strongly handed to most of this Kingdome, yea and the dreggs thereof to seize upon the vitals of many; which hath produced, even ve∣ry dangerous and unexpressible epidemi∣call Anxieties and Sincos. Upon seri∣ous and frequent meditation therof, ray∣sed through my owne sad experiences, e∣ven in the midst of our greatest con∣tinuing miseries, I heer have endeavoured to fit and prepare this discourse, as a Co∣fectionary of spirituall Reliefe and Cordi∣all Comfort for all such as may fale and faint under the heavy pressures of any of this worlds Afflictions; and now make bold to present them unto you, not as if

any necessity in you called upon any such advertisements: But that I very well know with what christian resolution and patience you have out passed the losse of  hopeful and valorous son, slain in the pub∣like cause of Religion & Kingdomes, be∣sides the danger of your own, hazard and wounds of divers other your sons, banish∣mēt from your own house & family, plun∣dering of your goods, and the continued want (even untill this time) of a part of your estate. These, I say, may suffici∣ently testifie your proficiency in this more then Aesculapian Art: Yet howsoever in tender of my due observance to your selfe, hoping their shortnes may no way impedite your more serious imployments, now of publick concernment and present agitation: I dedicate this Cordiall, and offer the perusall thereof unto you: Desi∣ring from my heart, as they are by me in∣tended, they may strengthen the weake and feeble, be oyle of joy for mourning, and the garment of prayse for the spirit of hea∣vinesse, and so safely to usher us along in uprightnesse and holinesse heere, that we all may receive eternall blisse and happi∣nese hereafter; through Christ Jesus our Lord, which is the constant and fervent prayer of
Yours ever bounden,
