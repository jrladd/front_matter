I Am not forgetfull good Sir Iohn of a promise made touching The man is but his minde: Which worke now I present you, though not so well penned as the matter requireth, yet as wel ment as any peece of worke in this Booke, written as well to keepe promise, as to show the circumstance of the mistery that belongeth to euery mans minde, and to hope that all I write thereof shall be as well taken as a dutifull wri∣ter can meane. I haue plainely set downe mine opinion in that behalf, doubting not but some one man or other shall see a peece of his owne minde, in this my presump∣tion of the same. So wishing your good and vertuous minde augmented in grace, and your selfe encreased in worship and contentation of mind, I betake you to God and fall to my purposed discourse.
