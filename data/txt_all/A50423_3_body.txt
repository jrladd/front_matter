Jngenious Artist, whither do'st aspire?
Or why t'outvye the Ancients do'st desire?
Have they not left enough to following Ages?
No: Thou their Master art, they but thy Pages.


My feeble Muse can never soar so high,
As thy Deserts herein extend, nor nigh.
Yet give me leave hereof to speak my mind:
No Man could better teach us in this kind,
Each Part so useful, and so plain I find.
