MADAM,
IT is not needfull, I
should use many
words, to let You
know, that this Booke belongs

to Your Ladiship, It suffi∣cing
that You know, I am
Yours, (since You gave me
the liberty, to call my selfe so,
when I had the Honour to bee
admitted into the House of my
Lord Your Father, where
my Parents did introduce me,
and where I have profited neere
You and my Lady Ara∣bella
Your Sister, as in a
Schoole of Vertue) whence it
followes, that Jonely give You
that which is Yours, being
found in me: and though it
should be otherwise, I could not

present it to any one, that deser∣ved
it better then Your selfe.
The reading of this Epitome,
MADAM, which I dedicate
unto You, as being Yours,
and which I put to light under
Your protection, will represent
ARGENIS unto You, as the
Fairest, most Vertuous, and
Constant Princesse of Her
time. And I have thought, rea∣ding
this History, that I have
seene Your true portraiture in
the person of this Faire La∣dy.
For, making a Parallell of
this Princesse with Your

Honour I finde You very
suteable; yea I can witnesse
with truth, that You surpasse
Her: since that besides the
Beauty of the Body where∣with
Nature hath endowed
You; You are also inrich'd
with that of the Soule beyond
measure; and as touching Ver∣tue
whereof You are a Pat∣terne,
You excell Her, being
Vertue it selfe. You have
besides the knowledge of the
True GOD, which is the
Ground and Basis thereof, and
whereof our ARGENIS was

ignorant; and as for Con∣stancy,
You have not (I dare
say,) Your equall, seeing You
are resolved, to be conformable
unto the Will of GOD, and of
my Lord Your Father. To
which may bee added Your
Birth (as well as unto our AR∣GENIS)
which makes You
truely worthy to beare the
Pearled Crowne, where∣with
my Lord Your Fa∣ther
hath beene Honoured,
without asking or intercession;
but by the Kings onely Will,
who gave it Him for His e∣minent

Vertue and good Ser∣vices;
being of the number of
those of whom the French Pro∣verbe
makes mention; saying,
TEL DEMANDE ASSEZ, QUI BIEN
SERT.
And to conclude MADAM,
I say, that-even as it hath
pleased GOD, to fill our AR∣GENIS
with Joy and Content,
giving Her, Her POLIAR∣CHUS,
as the most Compleat
Prince of the Earth, He may
send You for Your, and
Your most Honourable
Parents Comfort, a Hus∣band

worthy of You, And
I am confident, Hee will bee
farre Compleater then POLI∣ARCHUS.
These are the
Wishes
MADAM,
