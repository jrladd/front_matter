My LORD,
IN the following Sermon, Preached before Your Lordship, I have considered the Condition of man under some of the Principal circumstan∣ces of this present life, and have endeavoured from thence to State the Notion of his Happiness: to Prove the Possibility of Attaining it; and to
direct to the means and Methods by which it may be acquired. This indeed is an Argument of the Greatest Weight, of general Concernment, hard to be explained and frequently mistaken. But coming after so many great Philosophers and Learned men of all Ages, who have considered this Subject, and transmitted their thoughts up∣on it, I cannot reasonably hope, to have added any thing that was not observed before, or Il∣lustrated any thing that was obscure. Yet in Obedience to Your Lordship's Order, and in hope that the consideration of our common, as well as our greatest good, which the practice of our Religion will bestow upon us, may somewhat con∣duce to compose the distractions, and allay the animosities which Particular respects, Private interests and parties of Religion have raised a∣mong us; therefore, under Your Lordship's Pa∣tronage, I have Presumed to make my Sermon Publick, who am
My LORD,
