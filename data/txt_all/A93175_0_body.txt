Sir,
IT will be a long Ambition satisfied, if by this, I have the happinesse of making my self more known to you, though in the same Act I put my self to a blush, that I have not a better present to excuse the confidence. If I do look upon you but as you relate to me in the common In∣terest and Fame of your vertues, wherein I share with others, I may be censured a bold man, since as they are proportioned to me, they are more then equall to the whole deserts of some that write both honour and abilities. But when I consider that graceful part of your Character, Sweetnes, which gives both the Price and Beauty to your

other furnitures of Art and Nature, I cannot think my self without capacity of pardon for this application, the well meant tender of my service.
They are Papers in themselves not worth your eye, or to be numbred with those reserves of wit and learning that wait upon your recreations; and if they receive entertainment abroad, I shall acknowledge it rather a debt which men pay to your Name, then a merit of the Poems; and if they meet with the frowning world, I have subscribed my owne, to be accused for them, and this presumption. Howsoever, if they may enjoy but your smile and shade, which was the first choise of my thoughts, it shall incourage me to reach your worth with more sutable imagi∣nations; till when, give me leave to write my self
