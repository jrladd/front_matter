Right Honorable, and Honorable,
THe hearts of such who truly fear the Lord in this our Israel, cannot but be towards you, who have jeoparded your lives to the death, in the high places of the field: what Titus ac∣knowledged in his success against Jerusalem, the same may we in yours, Des vobiscum in liberand hoc regn pugnavit, he who hath called you unto, fitted you for this service, hath united your spirits mutually to affect, to effect one end, that you are ut manus ut mens Angli, as Hector, & Aen of Troy, whereby the Publick hath gained much, both Peace, & Liberty, although your selves as yet little, for magis mor, quam mummorum causa, doe you ingage▪ England unworthy the affections of such Worthies, (this Generation much degene∣rating) that should you respect the opinions of man concern∣ing you, more then the affection of God, unto you, who ob∣serves all men, all things, (a heathen but a speach becom∣ming a Christian) you would repent of all that good affor∣ded them: But whatever is the estimation of the world, you are the glory of God in his Churches, (apud deum major est qui melior, & ille melior qui in virtutib praestat). The Crown of his Saints, yea Sanctorum amor & delici. Luther tells us there be Miracula, Ocularia and Auricularia: Ages to come will admire our mercies in such renowned in∣struments: should we unworthily forget you, or your acts,

which deserve to bee had in eternall  not wee of this Nation variable in our affections,  in our judgements, wee could not but honour  your Physicall Prescriptions, (upon the Prudenti Obser∣vance of the Causes▪  and Pognost it is of the Ma∣lady of this State, (for spent by the Kings evill) administred in the most desperate Paroxysm of our great Body Politick, effectuall (through the Lords blessing) to the absolute cure of the Nation, the Remedy being powerfull not only to re∣move what at present doth distemper this State, but to prevent what in future may occasion a Perillous Relapse, ut hil de∣fiit, quod ad salutem sufficit. These acts of your doe publish your Honours, your Humilities doe crown your Graces, thereby you deserving rather then desiring the praise of your vertues, your vertues. And because your Prudence, as well as your Courage, the wise and Omnipotent God hath prospered to the healing of the Nations, I shall humbly beseech you▪ to improve both for the advance of Religion in the power and purity thereof, and maintenance of Justice amongst us gal the evills threatning this Nation in the deformation of the one, or in the Non or Mal-administration of the other, may he prevented and removed.
The Lord beat your enemies as smal as the dust, and stamps them as the mire of the street, give you courage to pursue them, and not to turn again untill you have consumed them: the Lord be the shield of your help, the Sword of your Excel∣lency, that by his strength you may run through a Troup, by his help you may scale a wall, that your feet may be  Hinds feet, and a how of Steel be broken by your Arms: the Eternall God be your refuge, and underneath you be his ever∣lasting Arms: that the Enemy may be thrust out from before you in England, in Ireland, that he may say destroy them, that you may return from Ireland with as many victories by your Armies, as good security to your persons, as much rejoycing to your friends, as great confusion to your Enemies as you did from Scotland, that all there, all here, all elsewhere, that do con∣spire agaist you, (even the multitudes of the great and ervi∣ble ones) may be as chaffe that passeth away, and perish in an instant, sodainly: as the Lord hath said, so prayeth
