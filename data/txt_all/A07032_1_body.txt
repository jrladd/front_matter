SEyng (my good Lordes) that all, Princes, Rulers, and Gouernours are the ordenaunce of God, and, as Sainct Paule in the 13. to the Ro∣maines, and diuers other places of the holy Scripture witnesseth vnto vs: Carie not the sworde in vaine, but for the preseruation and main∣tenaunce of the good, and the resi∣sting and punishyng the wicked and vngodly: Well then, haue my Lordes, the Estates, and Magistrates of the Prouinces vni∣ted to the lowe Countreis, deserued all honour and commen∣dation, who, after the wonderfull dissentions and breaches of certaine of the Prouinces and Cities (that separated them sel∣ues from the greater nomber, bothe forgettyng al their honor, and othe, and condescendyng and agreeyng to the Enemie) haue not onely continued their vnitie, but haue a greate deale more confirmed the same: and therefore when I throughly cō∣sider of the great constancie and stabilitie of the Estates of Hol∣lande and Zealande, as also of the marueilous greate fidelitie of
my Lorde the Prince of Orenge, who ioynly, and altogether, very faithfully haue performed all office & duetie in the main∣tenaunce of the warres against Tyrauntes. I could not possibly but commende and set forth their deserued honour, commen∣dation, and praise, aboue all the rest of the Nations whatsoe∣uer, that haue been so wonderfully aduaunced and renowmed, aswel by the Auncient, as also by the late Historiographes. And therefore, in my poore opinion and iudgement, I can not see how the confedered and vnited Prouinces maie doe better, then to followe the waies and steppes of the Hollanders and Zealanders, in euery poinct and condition, in makyng warre, and standyng against the force of all the rest of the Lordes and Princes of the other fifteene Prouinces: For, if thei had other∣wise doen, thei had neither wonne honour, nor yet gained any thing els thereby. For, what a more wholesome, better, profita∣ble, and necessarie thyng could thei haue taken in hande, then to fight and make warre for the Religion, and defence of their Countrey, by which meane thei might keepe themselues from the horrible oppression of bloodie Tyrauntes: seeyng the very Heathen haue gotten them selues great honour, by defending of their Countrey.
Wherefore, sith the defence of a mans Countrey is so good and honourable a thyng: and the defence of Religion, a thyng farre more excellent, and of greater importaunce: there is great reason the Magistrate should wholy endeuour hym self to de∣fende his good and faithfull Subiectes. But what way maie any Common weale most fitly be defended, whē as there reigneth suche greate discorde and dissention among Subiectes? Surely, there are twoo meete kyndes of meanes to bee had and vsed a∣mongest three estates of men, for the defendyng and vphol∣dyng of a Common weale, in peace and vnitie. And first of all, the Magistrates, are to obserue twoo thynges for the defence and maintenaunce of a Commonweale in tranquillitieto wit, Iudgement and Iustice. By Iudgement, in seuerely, and not rashly, vsyng the sworde giuen vnto them by God, for the pu∣nishyng of the wicked and offenders, to the ende the good Subiectes might bee saued harmelese, and preserued from all
oppression and iniury: They are also to haue a diligent care, not to shed innocent bloud, for feare that the bloud of the In∣nocentes crie out to God against them, for vengeaunce, and so he require the bloud of them at their handes: For, in the booke of the Cronicles it is saied vnto the Iudges: Beholde ye Iudges what you doe, you execute not the Iudgement of men, but of God, you doe Iustice, when as you pronounce true and right Senten∣ces: in defendyng the Wydowes and Fatherlesse, in doyng of them speedie Iustice, not corruptyng the Lawe either for money or re∣warde, and not giuyng iudgement to the hurte of any of the par∣ties, either for want of not knowyng the cause, or els through ig∣noraunce. Wherefore, it is a moste necessarie thyng for Iudges to be learned in the Ciuill Lawe, whiche thyng Plato the Hea∣then Philosopher well considered, when as he saied: That, that Common weale was very happie, whiche was gouerned by wise∣men, and Philosophers. Secondarely, two thynges are necessarie in euery Christian Churche, to the ende that no offences or dis∣sentions arise amongest the people: The first is, the pure and sin∣cere doctrine of the worde of God, with the true administra∣tion of the Sacramentes, neither addyng to, or takyng fro, any one of them: for, it is written in the Apocalipse, That that man is cursed whiche either addeth or taketh awaie any thyng from the worde of the Lorde. The other is, that discipline and iudge∣ment be straightly kept in the Churche of God, without tolle∣ration, or dissimulation, or without respect of any persone or persones: That all Whoremongers, Dronkardes, and all other whatsoener that doe continue and abyde in greeuous and grosse sinnes, be excommunicated and cast out of the Church, to the ende the whole Churche be not corrupted and infected by them, and others, take offence at their doynges
Thirdly,
 sect of the anabaptists ari∣seth in diuers places. there are two thynges necessarie to bee obserued in euery particuler Familie or housholde. The first is, that fa∣thers and mothers of housholdes must bryng vp their Familie of honestly, and not suffer their meney to want thynges necessao¦rie: For, S. Paule saieth, that that man is worse then an Infidera∣whiche prouideth not for his housholde. The other thyning of the correction and chastesing of their children and serua tes,
who are to bee corrected and kept in awe. For, Salomon saieth: He that spareth the Rodde, hateth his Childe. For, youthe is compared, vnto yong Trees, because whosoeuer he bee that will haue straite yong Trees, must set a very straite staffe harde by euery of them: And so, if yong youthes be well taught and brought vp from their cradle in the feare of the Lorde, and in his waies and pathes, those youthes I saie, will become very ho∣nest, and feare the Lorde. Now then my good Lordes, if these three estates of men were well brought vp, the worlde would bee at a sarre better staie then now it is, for then we should bee sure to heare no newes of so perilous ciuill warres, sheddyng of bloud, burnyng, and destructions of Prouinces, as now pre∣sently we see: for, many Prouinces are now brought to naught, many Cities sacked, the Enhabitauntes murdered, and vtterly spoyled: and the onely cause and originall of altogether is this, that the three estates aforesaied are not duely and truely orde∣red and gouerned, and therefore of very right and reason, wee iustly feele the heauie indignation and wrath of God fallen vp∣pon vs. Now, for conclusion my Lordes, I haue been very de∣sierous to dedicate this my Booke vnto your Lordshippes, con∣teinyng the ciuill warres in the lowe Countreis, wherein you maie beholde, the originall and first beginnyng of these troubles and bloudie warres, together the stratage∣mes and practizes of the Popish and Spanishe Inquisition, vtterly to roote vp the Churche of God. Beseechyng you my good Lordes to take all in good parte.
