My Lord,
BEing to Publish these last re∣mains of the Celebrated Mrs. Behn, I cou'd not lose so proper an occasion of shewing the Respect and Value I have for your Lord∣ship. The humour of Novels is so sunk for some Years, that it shews an extraordinary desert in Mrs. Behn, that they are still in ge∣neral esteem. Others have sought after extraordinary and scarce possible Adventures, she happily consulted Nature, which will al∣ways

prevail; so that I may call her the Otway of this kind of Writing; whose Natural Scen's live and encrease every day in esteem with the Ingenious, while the fantastic Rants of some of her Cotemporaries dye even before their Authors, tho so Celebrated, and follow'd in their first repre∣sentation.
I know 'tis the custom of Au∣thors to fill their Dedications with fulsome flatteries, but as I am no Author so I shall avoid their faults, and only profess a sincere veneration for those ma∣ny Noble Qualifications which render you the Darling of the Witty, and beg leave to subscribe my self,

Next after the Wandring Beauty.
