Reverend Sir,
VNder God, and next to my Parents, I may righty term you the dearest friend that I have in the World; from whom when I was at Oxford a Student in Merton-College, I received many favours, and great encouragements to the promoting of my studies, being by your care and vigilance over me preferred from Pembrook-College, over which your self is a worthy Master, thither
to a Schollers place in the house. And since I left Oxford, I have been con∣tinually in your thoughts, when God shall open a way for my further pre∣ferment. Ʋpon this account, with many other obliging arguments, I have presumed in this present Trea∣tise, a the first fruits of a more plen∣tifull harvest, to address my self unto you by way of thankefulness, to whom I owe my self, and the praise and the glory, as to a secondary cause, of all those services which God shall ever enable me to doe for his Church and people. My portion to dispense the Word of God is fallen out in a very disheartning and in an evill time: yet let the opposition of the world, of flesh, and of the devil; let the carnall reasonings of flesh and blood, let the malice of unreasonable men be never so great, I have determined with my self to be the servant of Jesus Christ, and of his Church, so long as my life, health, strength, liberty, or any ability
by the good providence of God is pre∣served unto me; and to spend it, and to be spent for the Gospel of my Sa∣viour. If I meet with opposition, as I must doe, I have nothing but what I looked for, and what is my lot and portion while I am in this life, and what all the faithfull servants of Jesus Christ have formerly undergon, and what the enmity in the spirit of the world against the Spirit of God doth naturally produce; and what we must have if we be faithfull and consciencious in our places, not daw∣bing with untempered mortar, but speaking the truth in the heart; and what follows as necessarily whereso∣ever the power of godliness, the cross of Christ, the lesson of self deniall, and the setting our selves against the corruptions of the times, and the breaking down of the Magazines of sin, and the setting up the pure wor∣ship of God, and a plain, sincere, honest hearted dealing for the good of their
souls, not sparing any, high or low, rich or poor, honourable or despised, so he it God may be glorified, and the Kingdom of Christ advanced, is fully held forth. An evil time I say it is, wherein, under a colour of zeale for the cause of God, as if these were the forerunners of Christs second com∣ming upon the earth, wherein as they say he shall reign a thousand yeers, as John the Baptist was the forerunner of his first comming (He indeed was so, for he came to prepare the way of the Lord, & to make his paths straight before his face: But if we grant them forerunners, they are no otherwise then sad omens of the worlds destruction, with all the rest of the Antichristian party, when Christ shall come to render vengeance upon them that know him not, and obey not the Gospel of his Sonne) they pervert the right wayes of the Lord, and corrupt the word of God, (before the second comming of
Christ there shall be an Apostacy from the faith) when they seek to remove and to put out the light of the glori∣ous Gospel, that they may sinne with more freedom, by turning our Bethel into a Bethaven, and the houses of the Prophets to a den of abominable wretches. Woe be to those men who are disobedient to the heavenly visi∣on, who despise Prophecyings, who re∣ject the word of his faithful Ambas∣sadors, calling them Popish fellowes, and Priests of Baal, under a pretence of higher mysteries. It will be the saddest time that ever England saw yet, if the Sun shal goe down upon the Ministers of the Gospel, and the night shall come upon them. Where the vision fails, the people perish. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.Prov. 29.18. Hosea 4.6. 2 Chro. 15 3, 4, 5, 6. When there was no vision, nor no teaching Priest, then there was no peace to him that came in, or to him that went out. David saith,Psal. 11.3. If the founda∣tions
be destroyed, what shall the righteous doe? And if a faithfull Ministry, and a conscientious Ma∣gistracy be removed, and men be suf∣fered to do what they list, without re∣proof and correction, and instruction, what can we expect but abominable prophannesse, but that England should become a second Rome, a se∣cond Babylon, and another Sodom? But yet I hope better things of Eng∣land yet, since God hath a precious seed to shew forth his praise, growing up in the two famous Ʋniversities of this land, watered exceedingly with Divine showers of heavenly grace, & with the influences from above, by the late prudent government in them; seeing by the wise providence of God such pious, conscientious and holy men do sit at the stern and doe guide the helm, lest the sons of the Prophets might be infected with the errors and heresies of the times; and the sons of Belial might prevaile over them;
though yet there is not a sufficient purgation of pride, self seeking and of the advancement of humane wis∣dom before the everlasting wisdom of God, from the Midst of them. And there is yet something to be done be∣fore the blessing of God will descend upon them in such a plentifull mea∣sure as otherwise it would, to wit, a joynt setting themselves with one shoulder, and with one consent to serve God in sincerity of heart, and to bestir themselves more then ever for the preserving of the truth of God, and to cleare the truth from all those calumnies which have been cast upon it in these latter times, and to stand up for the honour of God, and of his Church. Now as there is a gene∣ration of men, men of perverse minds, reprobate concerning the faith, given over to a spirit of delusions, blinded with a judiciall blindness, and hard∣ned with a judiciall hardness, led away with the vanity of their minds,
wicked and ungodly men, foreordai∣ned to destruction, who would pull down all Ordinances, as preaching, prayer, receiving of the Sacraments, holy conference, and all those means whereby grace is wrought, cherished, promoted, & confirmed in the hearts of believers: and which is far worse, they pretend to doe all this by the light of the spirit within them. As Mahomet the vilest of men did pre∣tend that he was inspired by the holy Ghost in the form of a Dove. so these miserable creatures pretend to the teachings of the spirit upon their hearts, that so their hereticall and blasphemous Tenents may receive the better entertainment. If they had not fathered their falshoods, blasphemies, heresies upon the Spirit of God, I had slept in silence, but when they make the Spirit of God to be a lying spirit, a deluding spirit, a profane spirit, by their saying that the Spirit teacheth them to live above Ordinances, to
blaspheme, to scoffe at the word of his grace, that the Spirit will supply all their wants without the use of means, and that they stand not in need of those beggarly Elements, to wit, the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, and other means of grace, as they call them, and all upon the account of the Spirits teaching: I had no rest in my spirit, till what light was imparted unto me concerning the teaching of the spirit upon the hearts of believers, I had published for the benefit and com∣fort of true honesthearted Christians; expecting to undergoe the censure of some Aristarchus or other, though God who trieth all things knoweth the sincerity of my heart in this mat∣ter. I wish the subject of my discourse had had a better workman to have handled it; but what is defective in my endeavours shal be supplied in my prayes, that God would poure forth of his Spirit more and more upon the hearts of his people, according to the
tenour of the covenant, and that Gos∣pel promise that we shall be all taught of God; and to rectifie those horrid abuses which are done to the blessed Spirit, and to shame those impudent creatures who say they are taught of the spirit, while they fulfill the di∣ctates and commands of the flesh and of the Divel, and to destroy the spirit of errour & prophaneness, the spirit of Antichrist which exalts it self in the lives of many Saints eminent in the eyes of the world, and to pre∣serve his people, his Embassadors, his Sacraments, his truth, his Word in the power and purity of it; and to keep us from Popery, superstition, will-worships, and from the doctrnes of men; and to make his Church a glorious Church for purity of worship and piety of life, in this thrice bles∣sed Nation, for the means of grace, and for the true knowledge of God which is in it; which is and ever shal be the request of him at the thron of grace, who is,
