REVEREND MOTHER. Having seen in English the little booke of the life of S. ELISABETH Queen of Portugall: vvhich F. Paludan. abbridged, and gaue out to all the people in Spanish, French, and Dutch, in the solemnitie ma∣de at the publishing of her Ca∣nonisation, in Bruxelles: I knew it to be your Reuerences hand wrighting, and being farder cer∣tified

that it was your ovvne la∣bour, and that you had your selfe translated it out of the dutch. Esteeming it so much the more, I conferred it with the originall; and finding it in all things to a∣gree, and to be à mirrour, not only for Religious, but also for Princes, I had scruple to hide vvhat vvas so behouefull for the commun good; therfore witnes∣sing heer the truth of the transla∣tion, I demāded of our superiour his approbation that it might be printed, vvhich had, I dedicate your worck to your ovvne selfe, vvilling you to go forvvard in so good exercise, for nothing mo∣veth more to perfection then the examples of those saintes that vvere in all respectes of the same profession that our selves are: nor contrarievvise can any thing more hinder it, then to be bound to one profession, and

in affection to follovv another. Verely, to your serious looking into theyr liues (next vnto your dayly, and nightly exercise of quire and meditation) I must at∣tribute that principall spirit of gouernement, to vvhich in short time you haue attained by the assistance of him who needeth no long times in teaching, Almigh∣tie God, who euer bless your en∣deavours, and bring vs all to see his face, in heaven. Pray for your pore Chaplain.
