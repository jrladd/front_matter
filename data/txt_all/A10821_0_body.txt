St. MORRIS ABBOT, Knight, Alderman of the Citie of LONDON, and Governour of the Company of English MERCHANTS, trading into the East-INDIES▪
And HENRY GARRAWAY, Esquire, Alderman of the said Citie of LONDON, and Governour of the Company of English MERCHANTS trading the Levant Seas.
YOur excellent skill, (much honour'd SIRS) in all the particular parts of Merchandizing, and your skil∣full excellencie in the Universall Commerce of the World, not only demonstrated by continuall experi∣ments, but also practised by sundry demonstrations, (especially under your Government, in those so worthy and honourable societies, of which you are at this present the happy Governours) promp∣ted me, that you were not only the fittest PATRONS of this Modell, but the best Iudges of the WORKE it selfe; and therefore if I were not induced by any other

motive, nor yet moved by any other inducement; yet this alone might both move and induce me, not onely to present you with this Dedication, but also crave from your Worths a friendly and favourable Protection.
But the further consideration of my particular Ob∣ligement, and the dayly experience of both your loves, challenged this justly from me, as the acknowledge∣ment of my respect and service: for before I had the fa∣vour of your acquaintance, I was made acquainted with your favours; and in Constantinople before you knew mee, I had the honour of your imployments; and after my returne thence, I found the approbation of my former indeavours extended it selfe not only to my admittance (as a Member) into those Societies you governe; but since into places of trust and repute in both of them.
Your experience and judgement then in the contents of this Tract considered, and my never-dying Gra∣titude for these your noble courtesies remembred: please to Patronise these my Labours, and in a faire constru∣ction accept of this my New-yeares acknowledgement: So shall both of you reap the Honour due to your owne Worths, and I the respect due to a gratefull FACTOR, which with all faithfull expressions I shall ever co∣vet to preserve; that I may as well futurely as formerly be honoured by your good opi∣nion, and intitle my selfe still your thankfull and affectionate friend, to serve you.
