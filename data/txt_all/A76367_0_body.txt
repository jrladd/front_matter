Right Honorable, Right Worshipfull,
WHen at first I saw this empty Pam∣phlet, Entitled, A Plea for the Com∣monalty of London, peep out of the Presse; much like a Glow-worm, proud of some counterfeit light, which it pretended to have; I imagined it the best way to let it alone, that it might shame it self by shewing it self, as indeed needing no o∣ther enemy to overthrow it but its own weak∣nesse.
But finding it since (with more successe then desert) to scatter a large spawn about the City by a second Impression; and that this painted worm began to deceive too many dim-sighted Traveller: I thought fit (from the service I owe to truth and Peace) and order which is a friend to them both) to send abroad this season∣able
light, which though it bee but small, is yet true, and I hope cleare enough to discover the other to be no more then a silly worm.
The Honour I beare to this famous City, and to the preservation of its Peace frō all seditious rents, which some turbulent sick braines will be ever hatching in it, causeth me at this time to present to your wisdoms two humble motions: The first as touching this Pamphlet, which I now take upon me to answer; the second as touching the maintenance of that honour and power which God and the Kingdom have in∣vested you with, and particular hands cannot justly take from you.
As touching the Book, I will not aggravate the spirit that it carries, and that carries it a∣long: nor the mischief that such a brat of too rash a brain, may breed (if not prevented) to your selves and this City. What tumults, up∣roares, might in all likelihood follow such da∣ring incouragements, in a multitude prickt with desire of power, and power of vindicating pre∣tended priviledges? (I blesse God) it hath yet taken no such effect.
Nor will I aggravate the Authours offence, whom (humbly submitting to your better
judgements:) I conceive bound by Oath not thus desperately to have sent abroad (without order from that Court, whereof he is a Member) so dan∣gerous a spark as this is, which though it seem little at the first, if not timely quencht, may quickly prove a great Incendiary.
Nor lastly, wil I tell you what power lies in your hands to punish such an offender, thus indevouring to disturb the Cities peace, by disturbing the Ci∣ties Order and Government, and thus (I had almost said) violating his Sacred Oath.
My Lord, I am not a man of that spirit: it was Caesars honour that he overcame more, and more overcame by his clemency then his sword; the last overcame but the bodies of men, the other their mindes: it will be your Lordships honour, and the rest of your Brethren, who are all ingaged in this Quarrell, in respect of the Author of this Pamphlet, to indevour as not to lose by him, so if possible to gain him, and if not to more wisedom, to more o∣bedience: But in the mean time I remember how Alexander dealt with one of his Souldiers, whom he heard railing at himself, who was his Generall. Though he might have punisht him at his pleasure, yet he took only this revenge upon him: He cau∣sed Proclamation to be made throughout his whole Army, that such a Souldier had scandalously railed
against Alexander. And that therefore for the time to come, he should have the liberty to say any thing what he listed, were it good or bad; no bo∣dy at all regarding or taking notice of what was spoken by such a fellow as he.
You shall not need to make Proclamation what injury the Author hath done you by this Pamphlet (who is, as it were, one of your Souldiers, and you his General) the Book it self sufficiently shews it; and the Answer a little more then the Book: Let me only commend unto you this Heroicall Reso∣lution; Neither to mind it for the present, nor him for the future, nor whatsoever he shall speak or write, till you find him wiser, and Let that be his punishment.
My second Motion which concerns your selves is this: That you would seriously consider, that the honor and power which is conferr'd upon you by Charter, and Custome, (the ancienter of the two) though it be in your hands to use, is not in your power to give away: nor will your famous City turn to be any other then a Monster of many Heads, when its renowned Government, which is now so fully established, and so bravely digested into a fit Method and Order; shall again be thrown into its old Chaos, by confusedly thrusting it into the hands of the Multitude, whom a great Emper∣our
long agoe compared to fire and water, that are good Servants, but bad Masters.
My Lord, I doe not any whit hereby charge or asperse those renowned Members of your own Body, the Commoners that sit below you: and with∣out whom you your selves are able to do nothing to any purpose: But as it is in the Naturall body, so I would have it in this body Politique; I would not be censured to derogate from the Hand or Foot, because I do not grant them to be the Head: I shall in this insuing Treatise give them all right that belongs to them; indevouring only to with∣hold both you and them from usurpation: In which Golden mean to preserve both them and you, and this City from all factions and fractions which turbulent spirits may breed among you: it was the only Argument mov'd me now to set pen to paper, and is all that is desired or intended by him who is
