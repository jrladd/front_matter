GEntlemen and Yeomen, maruell not that I write this Pamphlet in Prose now, ha∣uing
beforetimes set forth so many Bookes in Verse: The first reason that moued me to
write thus, was because I was Lame, and durst not write Verses, for seare they should be infected
with my Griefe, and be lame too. The Second Reason is, because that I finde no good rime for
a Coach, but Broach, Roach, Encroach, or such like. And you know that the Coach hath
ouer-throwne the good vse of the Broach and Broach-turner, turning the one to Rackes, and
the other to Iackes, quite through the Kingdome. The Roach is a dry bish, much like the vn∣profitable
profit of a Coach; it will cost more the dressing and appurtenances then tis worth.
For the word Encroach, I thinke that best befits it, for I think neuer such an impudent proud,
sacie Intruder or Encroacher came into the world as a Coach is; for it hath driuen many
honest Families out of their Houses, many Knights to Beggers, Corporations to pouerty, Almes∣dsds
 to all misdeedes, Hospitality to extortion, Plenty to famine, Humility to pride, Compas∣sion
to oppression, and all Earthly goodnes almost to an vtter confusion.
These haue beene the causes why I writ this Booke in Prose, and Dedicated it to all your good
Companies, knowing that you haue borne a heauie share in the Calamitie which these hyred
Hackney bell-Carts haue put this Common-wealth vnto; For in all my whole Discourse, I
doe not enueigh against any Coaches that belong to persons of worth or qualitie, but onely a∣gainst
the Carter piller swarme of hyrelings; they haue vndone my poore Trade, whereof I
am in Member, and though I look for no reformation yet I expect the benefit of an old prouerbe,
(Giue the losers leaue to speake.) I haue imbroadered it with mirth, Quilted it with
materiall stuffe, Lac'd it with similitudes; Sowed it with comparisons, and in a word, so plaid
the Taylor with it, that I think it will fit the wearing of any honest mans Reading, attention,
and liking; But howsoeuer, I leaue both it and my selfe to remaine.
