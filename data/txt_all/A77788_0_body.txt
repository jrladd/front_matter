Right Honourable,
IT is a generall Scandall, (upon what grounds I know not) thrown upon the Professours of the Law, (especially in this age, that the practicall knowledge of the Lawes of God, and of
our own Nation, do seldome meet together in one person; whereby they seem to put an incompatibility of devotion and sanctity, into the life of Lawyers: whereas Religi∣gion is sutable with all sorts of vocations, and he that is not Bonus Theologus, as to himself, and that does not make Religion his Primum, and his Ultimum, can never be well fitted for any Profession whatsoever. It is true in the Creation, God commanded the Plants, to bring forth their fruits, every one accor∣ding to its kind; and so he commands all Christians, who are living Plants of his Church, to bring forth fruits of Devotion, every one in his
quality, and vocation. For at ought to be differently ex∣ercised by different men, and the practice of it, must be ac∣commodated to the capacity, and imployments of each particular person, and when Religion is not sutable with the lawfull vocation of any man, then without doubt, that Religion is false: For true Godlinesse, is so farr from prejudicing any im∣ployment, that it adorns, and beautifies it: all persons be∣coming more acceptable in their vocation, joyning it with true devotion. And as knowledge is the glory of a man, so Divine knowledge is the glory of a Christian;
especially that of sacred Scri∣pture, which is most sub∣lime, and makes a Christi∣an happy to salvation. The Brick, and Straw of Egypt, is not comparable to the Gold, and Silver Vessels in the Temple; neither are Divine Instructions borrowed from Humane Learning, to be compared with the inesti∣mable value of those golden Precepts contained in holy Scriptures. For this cause, my Lord, have I linckt to∣gether this Chain of Golden Sentences, out of the holy Scriptures, and gathered this handfull of Flowers, out of that Garden of Paradise, to present to your Lordships
hands, which if your Lord∣ship please sometimes to smell unto, I doubt not but they may yeeld some fra∣grancy and sweetnesse. For the written Word of God af∣fords extraordinary sweet∣nesse, chearing a breast full of perplexities, & the power of it reforming the disordered lives of men, and snatching us from the gates of death, to e∣ternity. And since God him∣self in the Old Testament commands us, and Christ in the New enjoyns us, to read his holy Word, and to search the Scripture; I have therefore in the first place, made choice of those places of Scripture, that concern our hearing,
and reading the word of God; the knowledge of which, fully understood, and conscionably practised, is, or should be the main, and principall end of every true Christians endeavour. I have likewise observed the seve∣rall texts concerning the se∣verall Books, mentioned in Scripture, and the difference betwixt the Old and New Testament, and of the ne∣cessity of the Virtue, and the Benefits of Prayer. And that we may with more ease di∣gest those inconveniencies and distresses, which we have been acquainted with, and which do daily threaten worse unto us. I have there∣fore
produced severall Scri∣ptures concerning afflicti∣ons, and the benefit of them, if seriously considered: For how can a man suffer his heart to be dejected at the privation of any temporall blessings, or at the load of a∣ny afflictions which God shall lay upon him, if he con∣sider the vanity of the first, & Gods Justice in imposing the last; and that nothing is worth his serious thoughts, but what may accompany him to the Mansions of Eter∣nity. Certainly, if we seri∣ously reflect upon the excel∣lency of our own nature, and think upon that happy estate which we shall arrive unto,
if we make the Law of God our meditation, day, and night, we shall then wean, and take off our affections from this world, the cares whereof do very much clog our souls flight to heaven, and tedder us here below. I must confesse, prosperity is a great blessing of God, and duely used, is no mean ad∣vantage, both to ones self, and others; yet if the hand that gave, shall take away, we must not repine, at what God formerly lent us, and thinks not fit any longer to permit us the use of. In the next place, since our whole life ought to be a continuall preparation for death, I have
collected many meditations concerning it. And since, to perform any action well, a man must propose the end of that action to himself; and since, of all mans actions the government of himself, in relation to his future e∣state, is most important, and neerliest concerning him; a mans being in this life, being but instrumentally good, as being the means for him to be well in the next. I have in the last place, observed some things concerning the day of Judgement, and the happinesse we expect in the life to come. For there re∣mains an eternity to us, after the short revolution of time,
we so swiftly run over here on earth, and all that which in this world we call happi∣nesse, is not valuable, in re∣spect of the future, nor is any thing we do here, considera∣ble, otherwise then as it con∣duceth to our eternall well-being hereafter. And thus having given your Lordship an account of this small Tract, I must beg your Lord∣ships pardon, for putting your name in the Front of it: being I fear an undervalu∣ing your Lordship to prefix your name to so slender a piece: but it being a right hand errour, I hope it will be lookt upon the more fa∣vourably by your Lordship
my obligations to your Lord∣ship being so many, & great, that I am bereft of all other means of shewing my thank∣fulnesse, but by laying hold of any opportunity of subscri∣bing my self
My Lord,
