My Lords and Gentlemen,
HAving received this fol∣lowing Collection some yeares since, by the ap∣pointment of Mr. W. Woodnoth deceased, with∣out further directions then what might be gathe∣red from the Postscript and purpose of the whole Relation; I remember the Authour Mr. Arthur Woodnoth to have been a worthy mmber, and sometimes Deputy of this Com∣pany, and an ancient Adventurer and dili∣gent prosecutor of the best ends for the ad∣vancement of the Virginia Plantation. I conceive his purpose might be to take a fit∣ting

time for reviving the originall rights of this Plantation, and thereby to encourage this Company in their best endeavours, by setting forth the honour and constant good∣nesse of Sir Iohn Danvers likely to give the greatest assistance therein And considering the respect and gratefulnesse of most of the members and best interessed persons of this Company, in choosing that worthy person Sir Iohn Danvers your Governour, and fin∣ding his constant endeavours to answer the greatest of your expectations, in preserving your just rights and priviledges; I judge it now a it time to publish the same; and shall forbear to say more of his worth, so fully charactered throughout this Discourse.
