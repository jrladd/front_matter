MY LORD,
'TIs long that I have with great impatience waited
some opportunity to declare my infinite Respect
to your Lordship; coming, I may say, into the
World with a Veneration for your Illustrious
Family, and being brought up with continual Praises of the
Renowned Actions of your glorious Ancestors, both in War
and Peace, so famous over the Christian World for their
Vertue, Piety, and Learning, their elevated Birth, and greatness
of Courage, and of whom all our English History are full of
the Wonders of their Lives: A Family of so ancient Nobili∣ty,
and from whom so many Hero's have proceeded to bless
and serve their King and Country, that all Ages and all Na∣tions
mention 'em even with Adoration. My self have been
in this our Age an Eye and Ear-witness, with what Trans∣ports
of Joy, with what unusual Respect and Ceremony, a∣bove
what we pay to Mankind, the very Name of the Great
Howards of Norfolk and Arundel, have been celebrated on
Forein Shores! And when any one of your Illustrious Fa∣mily
have pass'd the Streets, the People throng'd to praise
and bless him, as soon as his Name has been made known to
the glad Croud. This I have seen with a Joy that became a
true English heart, (who truly venerate its brave Country∣men)
and joyn'd my dutiful Respects and Praises with the most
devout; but never had the happiness yet of any opportuni∣ty
to express particularly that Admiration I have and ever had
for your Lordship and your Great Family. Still, I say, I did

admire you, still I wisht and pray'd for you; 'twas all I cou'd
or durst: But as my Esteem for your Lordship dayly in∣creas'd
with my Judgment, so nothing cou'd bring it to a more
absolute height and perfection, than to observe in these trou∣blesome
times, this Age of Lying, Peaching, and Swearing,
with what noble Prudence, what steadiness of Mind, what
Loyalty and Conduct you have evaded the Snare, that 'twas
to be fear'd was laid for all the Good, the Brave, and Loyal,
for all that truly lov'd our best of Kings and this distracted
Country. A thousand times I have wept for fear that Impu∣dence
and Malice wou'd extend so far as to stain your Noble
and ever-Loyal Family with its unavoidable Imputations; and
as often for joy, to see how undauntedly both the Illustrious
Duke your Father, and your self, stem'd the raging Torrent
that threatned, with yours, the ruine of the King and King∣dom;
all which had not power to shake your Constancy or
Loyalty: for which, may Heaven and Earth reward and bless
you; the noble Examples to thousands of failing hearts, who
from so great a President of Loyalty, became confirm'd. May
Heaven and Earth bless you for your pious and resolute bra∣very
of Mind, and heroick Honesty, when you cry'd, Not guilty;
that you durst, like your great self, speak Conscientious Truths
in a Juncto so vitious, when Truth and Innocence was crimi∣nal:
and I doubt not but the Soul of that great Sufferer bows
down from Heaven in gratitude for that noble service done it.
All these and a thousand marks you give of dayly grow∣ing
Greatness; every day produces to those like me, curi∣ous
to learn the Story of your Life and Actions, something
that even adds a Lustre to your great Name, which one
wou'd think cou'd be made no more splendid: some new
Goodness, some new act of Loyalty or Courage, comes out

to cheer the World and those that admire you. Nor wou'd
I be the last of those that dayly congratulate and celebrate
your rising Glory; nor durst I any other way approach you
with it, but this humble one, which carries some Excuse along
with it.
Proud of the opportunity then, I most humbly beg your
Lordships Patronage of a Comedy, which has nothing to de∣fend
it, but the Honour it begs; and nothing to deserve that
Honour, but its being in every part true Tory! Loyal all-over!
except one Knave, which I hope no body will take to
himself; or if he do, I must e'en say, with Hamlet,
—Then let the strucken Deer go weep—
It has the luck to be well receiv'd in the Town; which (not from my
Vanity) pleases me, but that thereby I find Honesty begins to come in
fashion again, when Loyalty is approv'd, and Whigism becomes a Jest
where'er 'tis met with. And no doubt on't, so long as the Royal Cause
has such Patrons as your Lordship, such vigorous and noble Supporters, his
Majesty will be great, secure and quiet, the Nation flourishing and happy,
and seditious Fools and Knaves that have so long disturb'd the Peace and
Tranquility of the World, will become the business and sport of Comedy,
and at last the scorn of that Rabble that fondly and blindly worshipt 'em;
and whom nothing can so well convince as plain Demonstration, which is
ever more powerful and prevailent than Precept, or even Preaching it
self. If this have edifi'd effectual, 'tis all I wish; and that your Lordship
will be pleas'd to accept the humble Offering, is all I beg, and the greatest
Glory I care shou'd be done.
MY LORD,
