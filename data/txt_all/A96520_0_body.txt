IT is impossible to travell in a great Road, or take his journey to a great Emporium, but he must needs meet with passengers in his way; and there∣fore if I have fallen in with the con∣ceptions of others, I suppose I shall be no more blamed then they, who writing of poverty or griefe, or death, have made use of Seneca or Plutarch. or they that have handled Politiques, have consulted with Aristotles maximes, or have borrowed of Thucidides, and Tacitus, and Polybius, and Philip de Comines, and Lipsius & Guicciardine who have scatte∣red excellent notions concerning that subject; only herein I must crave pardon, that treating on the same argument which others have handled, there is wanting that skill and
 excellency in the handling of it: It was the unhappinesse of Silius Italicus to come after Virgil, and handle the same thing; and so also of Grotius to treat of the same matter with Tacitus, and of Paulus Jovius to be engaged in the subject with Titus Livius: Yet certainly it is so with the choycest works of the best Divines, we may subscribe them as I find at the end of divers famous Authors, plurima desunt & multa desiderantur; and many have been as happy in their supplements and additionals, and conjecta∣nea, as the Authors thēselves in the main subject. You were pleased to call me to preach upon the occasion of the rendi∣tion of Oxford, and also you have comanded me to print the Sermon: had I all the learning of a Ʋniversity, I could as willingly have laid it out in the behalfe of that place, and upon this subject which I have spent my thoughts upon as any other whatsoever. I have made bold to propound some things to your consideration concerning Oxford, in order to the reformation of it; which though perhaps they may seem to be but contemptible and poore, and such as are never like to rise to any glorious perfection; yet it is cer∣taine, that he that will build very high, must dig low for his foundation; and let not any one despise the day of small things, for we know there is no River navigable in the Fountaine, nor any Country where the Sunne shines hot at the peeping of the day: Perhaps some things may seeme strange, but let not any one condemne me for this, because it is a case which never was before you till now, and there∣fore we must not condemne that for ill which is only extra∣ordinary; this were to doe as that Norwegian, who when he saw red Roses first, he durst not handle them for feare of burning his fingers. There be some will tell you, there is no such need of a reformation of the Ʋniversity, and in∣vent
 praises for it; but I look upon such as they that are very partiall, as he was that made the Preface to the Ʋni∣versity Statutes, who speaking of Queen Maries dayes, hath his opranda temporum faelicitas for them; or else A Book inti∣tuled, Essays of certaine Para∣doxes. perhaps they have a mind to exercise their wits, as he did which invented prayses for Busyris, and made an Apolo∣getique for Nero, and Encomiums or Richard the third Joh. Donne his Juvenilia. and Julian the Apostate; or else perhaps they have a mind to imitate some whose crimes are vertues with them, and paradoxes truths, who maintaine the most absurd things, and inconsistent with truth and piety, onely as a specimen of their wit, to shew how they can put a kind of lustre and beauty on a monster. However some may Vid. Reform∣ed Prince. think meanly of this designe of yours for the reformation of Oxford; yet I think I may truly say of this what Balzac did of a great enterprize of the French King, that the modesty of an oratory stile doth not beseem an action so strange: Poets only have right to that, it appertains to their heroique language; it is worthy of the enthusiasme of their pompous and figurative descriptions; sure I am, there is scarce any thing more worthy all the contributions which a Parliament can afford, then the setling of the Ʋniver∣sity upon the basis of learning and Religion. You have an opportunity of laying a foundation, and of building too, which shall be beyond the reach of envy, against which the gates of hell shall not prevaile; but it shall be matter of wonder and rejoycing to succeeding generations, who shall with triumphant acclamations cry grace, grace, unto it: The Lord that hath called you to work for him, afford you the assistance of his most glorious power, the direction of his infinite wisedome, and crowne you with incom∣parable
 successe here, and give you an immarcessible crowne of glory hereafter. So prayeth he who counts it his happinesse to be
