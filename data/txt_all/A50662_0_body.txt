Honoured and Worthy Sirs,
THE drowsie Heads of the slumbring Sta∣utes made for the repairing

and amendment of High-ways being now rowsed up, which Laws for some time by-past, have seem'd to be as it were seised on with a Le∣thargy; and the High-ways (for lack of putting the Laws in Execution) were grown so foundrous (as the Law terms it) and so extreamly bad, that the Owners and Occu∣piers of Lands in most Places have been necessi∣tated to suffer their Fences to lie down, and to permit People to travel over their inclosed Grounds, to the private Damage of such particular Persons, and the publick Loss and Damage of the whole Country, in the

decay of Commerce and Trade, by reason of the im∣passableness of the High-ways. But since the evigi∣lating and exuscitating of the former Statutes, backt with the new Laws of their Majesties KING William and QƲEEN Mary; the Country People in most Places have set themselves to labour more effectually in the repairing and amending of their High-ways than they have usually done for∣merly. But notwithstanding their Activeness more than heretofore, yet they are very defective in the Measures taken about their Repairs in most Places, which is princi∣pally

occasioned through the ignorance of Surveyors of the High-ways, in the Duty and Authority of their Office; for although your Worships have given these Officers printed Directions, and do also acquaint them by Parol Instructions, yet many of them are so stupid and dull of Apprehension, that unless a thing be reiterated over and over, and over again, they either cannot or will not apprehend it: Therefore I conceived that some little methodical Pocket-Book of the Laws now in force about High-ways, might be (espe∣cially at this juncture of time) serviceable to the

Country: So having set some vacant Hours apart for that purpose, and bestowed some little Pains therein, I have methodized the product of my Barren Genius into the Ʋnpolished Form it now ap∣pears in, and do (pardon my Presumption) humbly dedi∣cate it to your Worships, not at all conceiving or ima∣gining that it can in the least better the Knowledge of any of your Worships in the Matters handled there∣in: But considering that a Prophet is not without Re∣ward but in his own Country, and suspecting that this rude and indigested Pamphlet and its Auchor, may not only

fall under the hard Censure of some, but also meet with th Scoffs and Slights of others I do therefore the better t secure and defend my Sel and it against such Contume∣lies and opprobrious Recepti∣ons, take Asylum under the Protection of your Worships▪ and do not only hope, but humbly crave you will no∣deny Tutelage to him who is▪
Gentlemen,
