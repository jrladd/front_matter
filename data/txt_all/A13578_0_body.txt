ACcording to youre Lo. pleasure (right reuerende Father) I haue copied out this Sermon, and let it go to the presse, remouing (at length though with much a do) a common reason that diswades verie many, and did for a time discourage my selfe: I meane the peruerse cauillatiō of such, as call into question other mens la∣bours, a greate deale busier to finde a fault, then do any good, as in deede it is easier to reprehende then iudge arighte, and mislike then do the like. I am so farre (I protest) from selfe loue or lyking, that I am still affrayde least some thinge of other bee committed
 whiche being sette out abroade, can not bee called in againe Manie may flatter themselues in a fonde conceite of there owne doings, and delight in the fauorable iudgemente of their friendes, but they shall finde it farre otherwise, when there workes come once to a vulgar protractation. I most humblie beseech your Lo. to defend with your accustomed fauour my vn∣worthye labour, and earnestlye praye my Bretheren in the Ministrie, to laie aside all former conceaued opinion againste the matter, and hartely desire euerie good reader besides to con∣strue euerie thing with a consci∣ence, as I for his sake in euery point haue spoken my con¦science. At your L. Mannor house at Ful∣ham: Aprill 22. 1592.
