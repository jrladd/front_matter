SIr, 'twas not the hope of
adding either to your ho∣uour,
or my owne profit,
(but my certaine know∣ledge
of the encourage∣ment
which any pious en∣deavours
shall receive
from your religious selfe)
that made me not hazzard, but presume on your
acceptance: were my Position contrary to what it
is, I might then be sencible of a fear, and suspect
its welcome; because I am confident that nearnesse
of relation cannot bribe your judgment, no not to

purchase but a slight view from your observing eye.
But being as it is, no way contradictory to what I
affirmed before: I hope it will not breed in you the
least suspition of a change in my affections: Sir my
hope of your acceptance, is not grounded upon the
agitation of so poore a principle, as that of Kindred,
for I am sure that your judicious and alwayes just
censure, will not be pleased with that from me,
which from another would prove distastefull; there∣fore
(for my part) I shall not be refractory, but sub∣mit
to your profound judgement, and whether you
approve or disprove, I shall still remaine what I
ever was,
