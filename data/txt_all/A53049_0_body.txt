Most Noble, and Eminently-Learned,
DO not judg it an Impertinency, that now again I presume to offer unto you another piece of my Philosophical Works; for when I re∣flect upon the honour you have done me, I am so much sensible of it, that I am troubled I cannot make you an acknowledgment answerable to your great Civilities.
You might, if not with scorn, with silence have passed by, when one of our Sex, and what is more, one that ne∣ver was versed in the sublime Arts and Sciences of litera∣ture, took upon her to write, not onely of Philosophy, the highest of all humane Learning, but to offer it to so famous and celebrated a University as yours; but your Goodness

and Civility being as great as your Learning, would rather conceal, then discover or laugh at those weaknesses and im∣perfections which you know our Sex is liable to; nay, so far you were from this, that by your civil respects, and undeserved commendations, you were pleased to cherish rather, then quite to suppress or extinguish my weak endeavours.
For which Favour, as I found my self doubly indebted to you, so I thought it my duty to pay you my double acknowledg∣ments; Thanks, you know, can never be unseasonable, when petitions may; neither can they be unpleasing, when petitions often are troublesome; and since there is no sacrifice, which God is more delighted with, then that of Thanks-giving, I live in hopes you will not refuse this repeated offer of Gra∣titude, but favourably, as a due to your Merits, receive it from her, who both of your Ingenuity, Learning and Civi∣lity is the greatest admirer, and shall always profess her self,
