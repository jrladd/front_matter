SVBMITTED to the censure of them onely, who shall haue duely exami∣ned these expressions of pla∣ces most difficult, abstruse, and of most various inter∣pretation and exposition:
Which if it proue favorable may produce another Edition more ex∣act, compleat, and of a larger letter; if otherwise it may provoke those who are more able to performe it better.
