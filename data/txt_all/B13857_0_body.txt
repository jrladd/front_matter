Right Honourable:
I Cannot but thus gratulate to you your happy re∣turne from your many, and noble imployments; which haue made
you, some yeeres, a stranger at home; and so renowned abroad, that all the better parts of Eu∣rope know and honour your name, no lesse, than if you had beene borne theirs; Neither is any of them so sauage, as not to say, when they heare mention of your worth, that Vertue is a thousand Escu∣chions.
If now your short breathing∣time may allow your Lordship the freedome of quiet & holy thoughts, cast your eyes vpon Israel and Iudah, vpon the Kings and Pro∣phets of both, in such beneficiall varietie as prophane historie shall promise in vaine. Your Lordship shall see Rehoboam following Sa∣lomon in nothing but his seat, and
his fall, as much more wilfull than his father, as lesse wise; all head, no heart; losing those ten Tribes with a churlish breath, whom he would (and might not) recouer with bloud. Ieroboam as crafty, as wicked; plotting a reuolt, crea∣ting a Religion to his state, mar∣ring Israelites to make subiects, branded in his name, smitten in his hand, in his loynes. You shall see a faithfull messenger of God, after miraculous proofe of his courage, fidelity, power, good nature, paying deare for a little circumstance of credulous disobedience; The lion is sent to call for his bloud, as the price of his forbidden harbour; You shall see the blinde Prophet de∣scrying the disguise of a Queene,
the iudgement of the King, the re∣mouall of a Prince, too good for Ie∣roboams heire. You shall see the right stock of Royall succession flourishing in Asa, whiles that true heire of Dauid (though not with∣out some blemishes of infirmity) inherits a perfect heart; purges his kingdome of Sodomy, of Ido∣latry, not balking sinne, euen where he honoured nature. You shall see the wonder of Prophets, Elijah, opening and shutting heauen, as his priuate chest; catored-for by the Rauens, nor lesse miraculously catoring for the Sareptan, conte∣sting with Ahab, confronting the Baalites, speaking both fire and water (from heauen) in one eue∣ning; meekely lacquaying his So∣ueraigne,
weakely flying from Ie∣zabel, fed supernaturally by An∣gels, hid in the rocke of Horeb, confirmed by those dreadfull appa∣ritions, that had confounded some other; casting his mantle vpon his homely successor, and by the touch of that garment, turning him from a plough-man, to a Prophet. But what doe I withhold your Lordship in the bare heads of this insuing discourse? In all these, your piercing eies shall easily see beyond mine, & make my thoughts but a station for a further discoue∣ry. Your Lordships obseruation hath studied men, more than bookes; heere it shall study God, more than men; That of bookes hath made you full, that of men,
iudicious, this of God shall make you holy, and happy; Hitherto shall euer tend the wishes and in∣deuours of
