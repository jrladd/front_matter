Gentlemen, and Ladies!
IF your serious occasions will permit me so
much honour, that this sleight Book may
bee accepted and perused, I shall justly ac∣knowledge
the favour to be far above either
my hopes or merit. And if you ever vouch∣safed
your Presence when it was presented on
the Stage, I am confident, your (no-way er∣ring-)
Iudgments will now allow it, as it then
was intended, which was, rather to provoke
a laughter, then occasion a contemplation. It
will likewise engage my grateful service, if I
be not (in your worthie opinions) taxt of Ar∣rogance,
to present my unpolished lines, when
daily those of excellence are offered to your Eies
and Ears: But in the confidence of your cle∣mencie,
I submit to the verdict of my grand
Iury. And how soever you are pleased to cen∣sure,
will remain (as I ought) the humblest of
your servants,
