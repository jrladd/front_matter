Reverend Fathers, and Brethren,
THe two later of the ensu∣ing Sermons are yours of right, as being preach∣ed in your Cathedral, and owing very much to your Candid and Chri∣stian attention. The other, that goes before them by order of Birth-right, may fitly be joyned with them, as tend∣ing to promote the same common end with them and the foregoing Tract.
I take the boldness to tender them
all Three, as a Testimony of the re∣verential, and cordial Respects I owe you; and of that Thankfulness which is due for the favourable Respect wherewith you have been pleased to look upon me, and to encourage me in exercising your Patience with my Dis∣courses from time to time.
I shall beg the help of your good Prayers, for the rendring these small Pieces as succesful as they are necessa∣ry, in these unsetled Times.
Long may you live to be burning and shining Lights, in that Golden Can∣dlestick; that the light of your pious Lives and powerful Doctrine, may re∣prove the works of Darkness; and that they who have said, Let us take to our selves the Houses of God in possession, may in due time be ashamed of their furious and preposterous zeal. This is the hearty desire of

Warmister, March 1. 1665.
