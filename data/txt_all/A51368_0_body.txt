SIR,
I Have long waited for such an Opportunity as this of ma∣nifesting the Sense I always had of your extraordinary Worth, and my own Obligations; I am extremely conscious that this Poem is not worth your Acceptance, and that it doth not rise up to the Dignity of the Occasion, which per∣haps is the greatest that is extant in the Records of History; but I am as well assur'd that you will let my Zeal atone for all the Blemishes which are so conspicuous thro' the whole Texture of the Work; I need not tell you who make the best Reflections for yourself, what a Train of important Consequences this Victory draws after it; that it will double and inflame the Courage of our Army in Flanders, if that can be capable of any Accession, and that it will root all our Alliances the stronger: The Com∣munity of Danger doth usually draw People into a stricter Ʋnion; and methinks an escape out of it should still bind us with a firmer Cement; Nay, I don't doubt, but that it will terminate in this Event too, that it will proselyte our male Con∣tents, and that the Coals of Fire with which we have burn'd the French Fleet will melt them down into a Charity with their Neighbours: If they had made a Descent no one can figure to himself what Miseries would have attended it.

But tho' their Hopes were so very lively, they would not have found such tame work of it as they expected; for I am afraid our Renegades would have been sacrific'd to the Resentments of the People. London, which is the Centre of Wealth, Loyalty and Courage would not have suffer'd their Wives to have been ra∣vish'd, their Children depriv'd of their Birth-rights, and Sla∣very entail'd upon them for an Inheritance; for if they had suc∣ceeded Smithfield would have again blaz'd out with Martyrs, every day had produc'd a fresh Massacre; and it would have come to this fatal push, as it was in the Reign of Charles the Ninth, the most treacherous and bloody Tyrant that ever wore a Crown, except this present Louis; ou la Mort, ou la Messe, ei∣ther Death or the Mass; these without an Hyperbole are the natural Effects of the Temper and Principles which are infus'd into the Papists; the first words they are taught are to Curse; and like Hannibal are sworn at the Altar to extirpate Here∣ticks.
I should think my self very prophane, nay almost blasphemous if I should call it a Religion, it is rather a Complication of all the Villanies that were ever acted under the Sun, colour'd over with that Name: They consecrate Daggers for the Breasts of Princes, can poyson with the Sacrament, have unhing'd all Ci∣vil Society, and destroy'd their Morals, have enslav'd Spain with the Inquisition, and made Italy Atheists by their Examples, they make Murther lawful, and dispense with Incest; In short, it is an Ʋsurpation upon the Rights and Consciences of Mankind, maintain'd by Interest and sooth, by Flattery.

I cannot resolve some Mens tarrying in that Communion, who are otherwise discerning enough, but into an implicite Education; they imbibe their Errors early, and then it is a difficult Task to unlearn what is riveted in and become habitual: They who are behind the Curtain, and play the Ressorts of the Machine, laugh at the Easiness of their Votaries, and cheat them of their Money.
But for them, Sir, who distinguish themselves by the Name of Protestants, and yet gnaw out the Bowels of their native King∣dom, this is amasing to a Prodigie; had they liv'd in the ri∣gid Common-Wealths of an Athens, or a Sparta, Pillars of Infamy would have been erected upon their Houses, and their very Me∣mories raz'd with Salt; the more exalted their Station hath been, the viler is their Apostacy, and the Guilt of Schism is whol∣ly upon their own Heads.
Great Names serve only to amuse and terrifie the Common Peo∣ple, but Men of quicker Penetration are never carried away by Popular Vogue, for as it is quickly gain'd, so it is as suddenly lost, and it is usually the Talent of designing and undeserving Men to be sollicitous after it; they had never been advanc'd to those Heights, had they not given very sanguine Presumptions of themselves, and have now made them good, by so obstinately adhering to that Inter∣est which prefer'd them.
A Man, Sir, may be very mortifi'd, and yet a great Hypocrite, and we may sometimes impute that to Zeal which is most necessary for his Constitution; for in some Cases Asceticks should be as well prescrib'd by the Physician, as they are enjoyn'd by the Rubrick: The false Bigot may look pale and discolour'd, and yet be very ma∣licious; for the Men of the Anvil will tell you, That the fierc'st Flame is always the whitest.

God, Sir, hath permitted this French Tyrant long enough in the World to disturb the Peace of it, and tho he was generally thought to be the Spurious Issue of a Cardinal, yet he hath suffer'd him to possess a Throne which doth not belong to him, and that with such Affluence and Splendor that Solomon in all his Glory was not aray'd like the French Lillies.
But now, the Critical Juncture seems to be come, when his Glory must undergo, not only a partial Eclipse, but be totally ex∣tinct: We only want to hear the same good News from the Army as we had from the Fleet, that our Victory may be entire and all of a piece, that the last Hand may be given to consummate their Ruine, and so no Gleanings may be left for an After-Destru∣ction.
And now let me trespass so far upon your Modesty, as to give you your due Character;
That you are Generous without Prodigality, Affable without Affectation, a prudent Manager of your Fortune, and a sincere Lover of your Friend.
You pursue the Recreations of the Countrey without neglecting your Studies, those divert your Time, but these employ it.
You were season'd with an excellent Education, and you still retain so strong a Tincture of it, that you scatter a Perfume wherever you come.
The Learning you have acquir'd doth not run out into quar∣relsome Disputes and pedantick Quotations, but you manage it for the better Conduct of your Life, and the Scholar serves to ac∣accomplish the Gentleman.

Besides, you are descended from a virtuous and obliging Fami∣ly, your Father was a wise and a very beautiful Person, my own (whose Ashes still I moisten with my Tears) hath always spoke of Him with a more than ordinary Emotion, and I have of∣ten heard him say, That he thought Sir Thomas to be the finest bred Citizen not only in these parts, but in England, and perhaps in all Europe; as you carry his Features and Complection, so you are more like him in the Endowments of his Mind which is the noblest Resemblance.
The good Lady your Mother may be the Standard to her Sex, she is assiduous at her Devotions, Liberal in her Chari∣ty, and very courteous and discreet in all her Deportments.
You had an Ʋnkle, Sir, who was crop'd off unnaturally in the Bloom of his Years, but he was the hopefullest Gentleman of his Age, so that this of Virgil might be properly apply'd to him,
Ostendunt terris hunc tantum fata, nec ultra
Esse sinunt;—
That Heaven only shew'd him to the World, and then snatch'd him away; but Time hath drawn a Scar over these Wounds, and his Loss is the less regretted because the other Brother sur∣vives, who by the universal Suffrage of all who practise him, is allow'd to be one who is vers'd in the Laws, understands the Interest, and loves the Welfare of his Country; his Oeconomy is magnificent, and yet with a just thrift. He is a great Patriot and a publick Blessing to all about him, and you, Sir, do not in the least degenerate from this Ancestor, and these Relations.
I wish that you may long continue to be an Ornament to our City, which though she is remark'd even to a Proverb to be a fond Entertainer of Strangers, let their Merit or Extraction be never so obscure, yet now they deviate from their ancient
Custom, and are all unanimous in placing their Respects upon you. If you design to marry again may you have a Lady wor∣thy of your Embraces, of a corresponding Temper, and equal Goodness, and then you cannot fail to be the happiest Couple in the World. I desire the Continuance of your Friendship, and that you will still honour me with the Quality I now as∣sume of being,
Dear SIR,
