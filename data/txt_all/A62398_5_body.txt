THe Iustice, Mercy, and the Might I sing,
Of Heavens Iust; Merciful, Almighty King,
By whose fore-knowledge all things were elected,
Whose power hath all things made, and all projected;
Whose Mercies flood hath quencht his Iustice Flame,
Who is, shall be, one, and still the same.
Who in the Prime, when all things first began,
Made all for Man, and for Himself made Man:
Made, not begotten, or of humane Birth,
No Seir but God, no Mother but the Earth,
Who ne're knew Child-hood, or the Sucking-teat,
But at the first was made a Man compleat;
Whose inward Soul in God-like form did shine,
As Image of the Majesty Divine;
Whose Super-natural wisdom beyond nature,
Did name each sensible and sensles Creature;
And from whose Star-like, Sand-like Generation,
Sprung every Kindred, Kingdom, Tribe and Nation:
All People then one Language spoke alone,
Interpreters the World then needed none,
There lived then no learned deep Grammarians,

There was no Turks, no Scythians, nor Tartarians;
Then all was one, and one was only one,
The Language of the universal Ball,
Then if a Traveller had gone as far,
As from the Artick to the Antartick Star,
If he from Boreas into Auster went,
Or from the Orient to the Occident,
VVhich way so ever he did turn or wind,
He had been sure his Country-man to find,
One hundred thirty Winters since the Flood,
The Earth one only Language understood,
Until the Son of Cush, the Son of Cham,
A proud Cloud-scaling Tower began to frame,
Trusting, that if the World again were drown'd,
He in his lofty building might rest sound,
All suture Floods he purpos'd to prevent,
Aspyring to Heavens glorious Battlement,
But High-Iehovah with a Pust was able,
To make ambitions Babel but a Bable.
These Shepherd Swains, I send into your view,
Are thirty one, a very worthy Crew;
Fifteen of them are Gentlemen of Note,
All of the renown'd Name of Scot;
Whereof Henry Scot in Palishil is one,
The youngest Shepherd Swain of all the name:
He's natural Son unto that bold Barron.
Sir Iohn Scot the Knight of Ancrum;
Both wealth and wisdom his Father doth embrace,
And he abounds in Iasons Golden Fleece.
