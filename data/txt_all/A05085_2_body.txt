GReat learned Ladie, whom I long haue knowne,
And yet not knowne so much as I desired:
Rare Phoenix, whose faire feathers are your owne,
With which you flie, and are so much admired:
True honour whom true Fame hath so attired,
In glittering raiment shining much more bright,
Than siluer Starres in the most frostie night.


Come like the morning Sunne new out of bed,
And cast your eyes vpon this little Booke,
Although you be so well accompan'ed
With Pallas, and the Muses, spare one looke
Vpon this humbled King, who all forsooke,
That in his dying armes he might imbrace
Your beauteous Soule, and fill it with his grace.
