LONG doubting most mightie Prince, either to passe my griefe in si∣lence most safe with Py∣thagoras, or to hazard speech in danger with Calisthenes, sith Demosthenes got as many Talents by not speaking, as Isocrates had by spea∣king, And therefore J must rather striue more with vertue then accuse for∣tune, though more vnfortunate then he that cryed in Aistophanes, that he had beene more then a thousand times vn∣fortunate,. that J may weepe more with Heraclitus then laugh with De∣mocritus,
and the rather that Bias escaped the fire at Prienna, Socrates the bullets at Tanagra, & Zeno shipwrak on seas: my selfe so vnfortunate that I sinke and suffer piracie on drie ground, with no lesse cause to sob then the Great Alexander had to sigh, He for want of children, and I for losse of my children. Whē Pindarus had asked himself , who was great then in Greece, not Aristotles happy man, not the Sto∣ickes wise man, nor stout Achilles in Ho∣mer, but they which had store of Owles in their houses in Athens, and they that had Snailes put vp in their chests in Sparta: for then virtus & sapientia testudini cessit, and so it is in all places, that he that hath not a friēd in court, if he write as many books as Chrysippus wrot O∣racles, he shall he considered as Crates
the Theban laide downe in his Ephime∣rides, Triobulum Philosopho, sumū Consiliario.
Hauing therfore most noble Prince spent my time sub Aegide Palladis scaling Pythagoras letter vntill age, sicknes and pouertie, haue summoned me to yeld my weapons Principi & Pae∣natibus patriae & to liue now like poore Lamachus & Antisthenes cum pera & baculo, and as Hippias the poore Philosopher learned in his olde age to make socks & slippers: so my self in the like age, learned to make glasses and spectacles: which if J might sell them as deere as I bought them, poore Irus should be as rich as Craesus, and he that liued sometime in face of the Sunne in Court, should not now liue as one of Menippus Moates in the moone out of the Court.
J hope I shall see through my glasse
some honorable friend that will com∣mend my Spectacle to your Maiestie, and to accept them as naked Gymnoso∣phists in their Indian coats, but better glasse then that Athenedorus gaue to the Caesars in Rome, or that Siman∣dius commended to the Pharaos of Aegipt, but of late Simon Magus had his glasses abroad placed in Cyclops heades, and thought to das Alexadner did of the moneth Iune in Macedonia, so to make the moneth of Nouember in England to be the merry moneth of May in Rome, some watching secretly vnseene with Giges ring for honor and dignite, some ready with Mydas hand for the spoyle, and many of them expect∣ed for the fift of Nouember in Eng∣land should be like the Jdes of March in Rome. They looke that day to haue
their full triumphes, and to put vp their Trophese: but vnus idemque dies al∣ter & albus: for that happened to king Iames in England as happened to Mardocheus in Persea, to Moses in Egipt: and to Lucculus in Rome: for periedes of kingdomes are limited of God not to be destroyed but by the sinnes of Kings and kingdomes: let vs then for the fift of August, for the fift of Nouember in coronatis conuiuiis coronati canere poean. Longing to heare the murther of Coesar in the Se∣nate, and to heare Brutus cry liberty out of the Senate.
Let vs that scapt their Kalenders, their Nones, their Ides, their moneths and their yeares, sacros cannere him∣nos. So did the Hebrues sing phaesah in Aegypt and the Jewes sang Phurim in Persia.
