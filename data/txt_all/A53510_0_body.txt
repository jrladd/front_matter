My Lord,
IT was not without a great deal of debate with my
self, that I could resolve to make this Present to
Your Lordship: For though Epistles Dedicato∣ry
be lately grown so Epidemical, that either
sooner or later, no man of Quality (whom the least
Author has the least pretence to be troublesome to)
can escape them; yet methought Your Lordship should
be as much above the common Perplexities that at∣tend
Your Quality, as You are above the common
Level of it, as well in the most Exalted Degrees of a
Noble Generous Spirit, as in a piercing Apprehension,
good Understanding, and daily ripening Judgment, all
sweetned by an obliging Affability and Condescention;
of which I have often, in the Honour of Your Con∣versation,
had particular cause to be proud; and for
which therefore, a more than ordinary reason, now,
to be Grateful.
And it is upon that pretence, I here presume to shelter
this Trifle under Your Protection; for indeed, it has
great need of such Protection: having at its first com∣ing
into the World met with many Enemies, and

very industrious ones too; but this way I was sure it
must live: Would He but once vouchsafe to espouse its
Defence, whose Generosity will overthrow the ignoblest
Envy; whose good Nature, cannot but confound the
most inveterate Malice; and whose Wit must baffle the
sauciest Ignorance.
My Lord, It would but argue me of the meanest
Impertinence and Formality, to pretend here an Ha∣rangue
of those Praises You deserve: For he who
tells the World whose Son You are, has said enough
to those who do not know You; and the happy few,
whom You have pick'd and chosen for Your Con∣versation,
cannot but every hour You are pleased to
bestow upon them, be sensible of more than I could
tell them in a Volume: Your Lordship being the
best Panegyrick upon Your self; the Son of that
Great Father of his Country, who when all manner
of Confusion, Ruin, and Destruction, was breaking
in upon us, like the Guardian Angel of these Kingdoms,
stood up; and with the Tongue of an Angel too,
confounded the Subtleties of that Infernal Serpent, who
would have debauched us from our Obedience, and
turned our Eden into a Wilderness. Certainly His
Name must be for ever Honourable, Precious His
Memory, and Happy His Generation, who durst exert
his Loyalty, when it was grown almost a reproach
to have any, and stem a torrent of Faction, popu∣lar
Fury, and fermenting Rebellion, to the Preserv∣ing
of the best of Kings in his Throne, and the happiest
of People in their Liberties.
May he live long to compleat the Reparations he

has made in our Defence; still by the strength of
his Judgment, to foresee those Evils that may yet
threaten us, and by the Power of his Wisdom to
prevent them; to root out the Footing and Foun∣dations
of the Kings open (nay, and bosome) Ene∣mies:
As a watchful, bold, and sincere Counsellor
to his Master; to be a driver of Treacherous, Grinning,
Self-ended Knaves, Insinuating Spies, and useless
unprofitable Fools from his Service: A Patron and
and Promoter of Honesty, Merit, and Ability,
which else too often, by neglect, are corrupted to their
Contraries.
In fine, to continue (as he is) a kind Indulgent
Father to Your Lordship, so much every way his
Son, and fit to Inherit his Honours, as in the strong
and shining Virtues of Your Mind, the fixt and
steady disposition of Your Loyalty, the goodness
and obliging temper of Your Nature, is apparent; by
which only I must ever humbly confess, and no pre∣sumptive
Merit of my own, I have been incouraged
to take this Opportunity of telling the World how
much I desire to be thought,
