My Lord,
AT Your Command I preach'd
this Discourse; but upon so
short a warning, that no∣thing
less than Your repeated Com∣mands
could have excus'd me for pub∣lishing
it. The Subject of it is Death;
a thing which You, my Lord, have
very familiarly convers'd with, and seen

in all its Shapes; but never, I be∣lieve,
found it so truly terrible as in
the Face of my Lady.
All that were about You were wit∣nesses,
with how Sensible a Concern
You bore the Loss of Her: and in∣deed
it was such a Loss, as even all
Your Courage was but little enough to
bear. I pray God, it may turn to ac∣count
to Your Lordship another way;
and may furnish You with such Re∣flections,
and inspire You with such
Resolutions, as, if well pursu'd, will
make You amends for any Loss, on this
side Heaven.
Your Lordship has chosen to express
some part of Your Grief this way, by
giving the World an Opportunity of
grieving with You: which it will

certainly do, wherever my Lady Cutts's
Character is truly known; and I have
endeavour'd to make it known in the
following Pages, with all the Since∣rity
that becomes my Profession: a
Quality, which, I must own to Your
Lordship, I would not forfeit upon
any account; no, not tho' I were sure
of doing the greatest Good by it. Some
part of what is there written I
know, and the rest I do in my
Conscience believe to be true, af∣ter
a very strict and particular En∣quiry.
If I may be so happy in what I
have said, as to contribute any ways
towards fixing a True Opinion of my
Lady's merit, and spreading the Inte∣rests
of Vertue and Piety by the means
of it, I have all the Ends I propos'd

to my self in this Discourse; beside the
Honour of publishing to the VVorld that
I am
