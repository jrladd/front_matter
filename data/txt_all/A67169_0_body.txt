Madam,
IT may seem an unpardonable rude∣ness, that to this Collection of Histo∣ries I should prefix so Venerable a Name: But tho' I may be judg'd guilty of a Presumption in this Dedication, yet the general Character of Your eminent Virtues (which gives as great a Lustre to Your Name, as Your Honourable Birth) does somewhat excuse and apo∣logize for me, and I question not but Your transcendent Goodness and Cle∣mency will prevail with You to patro∣nize a Piece (tho' unpolish'd before your Ladyships most discerning Judg∣ment) which may prove instrumental towards the restraining those execrable Crimes which are so frequently com∣mitted in this exorbitant Age; and likewise as it publisheth some other

Examples which may tend to the pro∣pagating those resplendant Graces of Friendship and Chastity, which may without Hyperbole or Flattery be said to be most Eminent in Your self. The Author's Affairs having call'd him far distant, before the Press had finish'd the Book, frustrated his intention of dedicating it to Your Ladship himself: And therefore, as the Presentation of it was design'd You from its Birth, so I am sure I have infinitely oblig'd the Author, by performing his desire, and I hope no ways contributed to Your Honours Dissatisfaction.
