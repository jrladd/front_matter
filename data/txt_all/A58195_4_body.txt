T To search the Indies for their Balm and Spice,
R Rifle the treasure of old Paradise,
E Enter all Breasts where Innocence doth dwell,
V Visit the Pulpit, or the Fryers Cell,
O Or search the Sea, and peirce the richest Mines,
R Run ore the Legend of the Saints, and Shrines;


H How needless then would all this labour be
A At our return, when we amaz'd should see
N Nature and Virtue had each sev'ral grace
M Made to inhabit in one Breast and Face?
E End then our strife, and in her Beauteous Name,
R Read all Perfection, and from whence it came.
