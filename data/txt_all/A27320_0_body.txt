May it please Your Grace.
DEdications which were Originally design'd, as a Tribute to that Reve∣rence and just esteem we ought to pay the Great and Good; are now so corrupted with Flattery, that they rarely either find a Reception in the World, or merit that Patronage they wou'd implore. But I without fear A∣proch the great Object being above that mean and mercenary Art; nor can I draw the Lovely Picture half so charming and so manly as it is; and that Author may more properly boast of a Lucky Hit, whose choice and fortune is so good, then if he had pleas'd all the different ill Iudging world besides in the business of the Play: for none that way, can ever hope to please all; in an Age when Faction rages, and di∣ffering Parties disagree in all things—But coming the first day to a new Play with a Loyal Title, and then even the sober and tender conscienc'd, throng as to a for∣bidden Conventicle: fearing the Cub of their old Bear of Reformation should be ex∣pos'd, to the scorn of the wicked, and dreading (tho but the faint shadow of their own deformity) their Rebellion, Murders, Massacres and Villanies, from 40 upwards, should be Represented for the better undeceiving and informing of the World, flock in a full Assembly with a pious design to Hisse and Rail it as much out of countenance as they would Monarchy, Religion, Laws, and Honesty; throwing the Act of Oblivion in our Teeths, as if that (whose mercy can not make them forget their Old Rebellion) cou'd hinder honest truths from breaking out upon 'em in Edifying Plays, where the Loyal hands ever out-do their venom'd Hisse; a good and happy omen, if Poets maybe allowd for Prophets as of old they were: and tis as easily seen at a new Play how the Royal Interest thrives, as at a City Ele∣ction, how the good Old Cause is carried on; as a Noble Peer lately said, Tho' the Tories have got the better of us at the Play, we carried it in the City by many Voyces, God be praysed!
This Play, call'd, The Roundheads, which I humbly lay at your Graces feet, Pardon the Title, and Heaven defend you from the bloody Race, was carryed in the

House nemine contra dicente, by the Royal Party, and under your Graces Ilu∣strious Patronage is safe from any new Seditious affronts abroad; Your Grace a∣lone whom Heaven and Nature has form'd the most adorable Person in the whole Creation, with all the advantages of a Glorious birth, has a double right and pow∣er to defend all that aproch you for sanctuary; your very Beauty is a guard to all you daigne to make safe: for You were born for Conquest every way? even what Phanatick, what peevish Politition, testy with Age, Diseases, miscarried Plots, disappointed Revolutions, envious of Power, of Princes, and of Monarchy, and mad with Zeal for Change and Reformation, could yet be so far lost to sence of Pleasure, as not to turn a Rebel to Revenge, the Good old Cause, and the patro∣nage to Plebean sedition with only looking on you, 'twoud force his meger face to blushing smiles, and make him swear he had mistook the side, curse his own Party, and if possible, be reconcild to Honesty again: such power have charms like Yours to calm the soul, and will in spight of You plead for me to the disaffected, even when they are at Wars with Your Birth and power. But this Play for which I humbly beg Your Graces Protection, needs it in a more peculiar manner, it having drawn down Legions upon its head, for its Loyalty — what, to Name us cryes one, tis most abominable, unheard of daring cryes another — she deserves to be swing'd cryes a third; as if twere all a Libel, a scandal impossible to be provd, or that their Rogueries were of so old a Date their Reign were past remembrance or History; when they take such zealous care to renew it daily to our memories: And I am satisfied, that they that will justifie the best of these Traytors, deserves the fate of the worst, and most manifestly declare to the World by it, they wou'd be at the Old Game their fore-Fathers played with so good success, yet if there be any honest loyal man alied to any here nam'd, I heartily beg his Pardon for any offensive Truth I have spoken, and 'tis a wonderful thing that amongst so Numerous a Flock they will not allow of one mangy Sheep; not one Rogue in the whole Generation of the Association. Ignoramus the 1st and the 2d.
But as they are, I leave e'm to your Grace to Iudge of e'm; to whom I hum∣bly present this small Mirror, of the late wretched Times: wherein your Grace may see something of the Miseries three the Most Glorious Kingdoms of the Vniverse were reduc't to; where your Royal Ancestors victoriously Reign'd for so many hundred years: How they were Govern'd, Parcell'd out, and deplorable inslav'd, and to what Low, Prostituted Lewdness they fell at last: where the No∣bility and Gentry were the most contemn'd and despis'd part of them, and such Meane, (and till then obscure) Villains Rul'd, and Tyraniz'd, that no Age, nor Time, or scarce a Parish Book makes mention or cou'd show there was any such Name or Family. Yet these were those that impudently Tug'd for Empire, and Prophan'd that Illustrious Throne and Court, so due then, and possest now (through the infinite Mercies of God to this bleeding Nation) by the best of Monarchs; a Monarch, who had yet the divine goodness to Pardon even his worst of Enemies what was past; Nay, out of his Vast and God-like Clemency, did more than Heaven it self can do, put it out of his Power by an Act of Oblivion, to punish the unparalell'd Injuries done His Sacred Person, and the rest of the Royal Family: How great his Patience has been since, I leave to all the World to judge: but

Heaven be prais'd, he has not yet forgot the Sufferings and Murders of the Glo∣rious Martyr of ever blessed memory, Your Graces Sacred Grandfather, and by what Arts and Ways that Devilish Plot was layed! and will like a skilful Pilate, by the wreck of one Rich Vessell, learn how to shun the danger of this pre∣sent. Threatning and saved the rest from sinking; The Clouds already begin to disappear, and the face of things to change, thanks to Heaven His Majesties infinite Wisdom, and the Over-Zeal of the (falsly called) True Pro∣testant Party: Now we may pray for the King and his Royal Brother, defend his Cause, and assert his Right, without the fear of a taste of the Old Sequestration call'd a Fine; Guard the Illustrious Paire, good Heaven, from Hllsh Plots, and all the Devilish matchinations of Factious Cruelties: and you, great Sir, (whose Merits have so justly deserv'd that glorious Command so lately trusted to your Care, which Heaven increase, and make your glad Regiment Armyes for our safety. May you become the great Example of Loyalty and Obedience, and stand a firm and unmoveable Pillar to Monarchy, a Noble Bull-work to Majesty; defend the Sacred Cause, imploy all that Youth, Courage, and Noble Conduct which God and Nature purposely has endued you with, to serve the Royal Intrest: You, Sir, who are obliged by a double Duty to Love, Honour, and Obey his Majesty, both as a Father and a King! O undissolvable Knot! O Sacred Vnion! what Duty, what Love, what Adoration can express or repay the Debt we owe the first, or the Ale∣giance due to the last, but where both meet in one, to make the Tye Eternal; Oh vvhat Counsel, what Love of Power, what fancied Dreams of Empire, what fickle Popularity can inspire the heart of man, or any Noble mind, with Sacreligious thoughts against it, can harbour or conceive a stubborn disobedience: Oh what Son can desert the Cause of an Indulgent Parents, what Subject, of such a Prince, with∣out renouncing the Glory of his Birth, his Loyalty, and good Nature.
Ah Royal lovely Youth! bevvare of false Ambition; wisely believe your Elevated Glory, (at least) more happy then a Kings, you share their Ioys, their pleasures and magnificence, without the toiles and business of a Monarch, their carefull dayes and restless thoughtful nights; know, you are blest with all that Heaven can give, or you can wish; your Mind and Person such, so excellent, that Love knows no fault it would wish to mend, nor Envy to increase! blest with a Princess of such undisputable charming Beauty, as if Heaven designing to take a peculiar care in all that concerns your happiness, had form'd her on purpose, to compleat it.
Haile happy glorious Paire! the perfect joy and pleasure of all that look on ye, for whom all Tongues and Hearts have Prayers and Blessings; May you out-live Sedition, and see your Princely Race as Numerous as Beautifull, and those all great and Loyal Supporters of a long Race of Monarchs of this Sacred Line. This shall be the perpetuall wish, this the Eternal Prayer of
SIR,
