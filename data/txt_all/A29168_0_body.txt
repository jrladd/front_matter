GREAT SIR,
 I Presum'd humbly to ask leave, and beg the Honour to Prefix Your Royal Name to this History, not Written according to the Ordinary Method, by which the Readers are Bound to Depend upon the Integrity and  Faith of the Author, for the Truth of the Things Related, but proved by Authentic Testimony. 'Tis not my own Invention, but Matter of Fact laid down, and warranted, by such as lived in the very Times when the Things were done, or near∣est  to them, or by sufficient Record. And my In∣tention in Writing after this Manner, was to shew and convince Men of Impartial and Unbyassed Minds, That they cannot, by Reading Ordina∣ry Historians, know what the Antient Govern∣ment  of this Famous Kingdom was; And that many have been deluded into several Popular Er∣rors, by only observing the sound, and common mistaken signification of Words; By the True Understanding whereof, and of Things done in

the Times I VVrite of, they might have Obtein∣ed a Right Notion of the Government and State of the Kingdom then, which at this day are much changed from what they were, to the great Ease and Repose of the King, as well as Benefit and  Advantage to the People. And the Present Constitution is an Even Rule to both, as his Due Power, and their Just Rights, are by Law main∣teined and secured; And is such as by Your own great Management, with the Assistance of Your  Loyal Subjects, may make You to be Beloved, and Honoured at Home, and Feared Abroad. For what Man is there of the Meanest Loyalty and Ingenuity, that doth or will but observe Your VVisdom, Justice, Courage, and Faithfulness to  Your Royal VVord, that hath not a Prospect of our future Happiness and growing Greatness? That therefore Your Health and Vigor may be such, as to Complete our Hopes and Expectati∣ons in making the British Name and Nations Great, and that You may by Your most Excel∣lent  Conduct and Admirable Courage, carry the Glory of them, not only over the Channel, but through Christendom, and to both the Indies, That Your Life may be Long and Easie, Your Reign ever Prosperous and Successful, and that  after the Period of Mortality, You may receive an Eternal Crown of Glory, Is, and always shall be the most hearty Wish, and sincere Prayer of
