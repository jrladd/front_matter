My Lord,
THO I am sensible of the obli∣gations I have to your Lord∣ship and the Court for your approbati∣on of this plain Discourse, yet I am apt, at the same time, to believe that it may chance to meet with a different sort of entertainment from
 some or other in the World: For when Mens prejudices are awake∣ned, their passions up, and they resolve before hand on division, 'tis in vain for a Man to expect from either side any instances of that Moderation he advises both to, it being natural for Men, when unhappily divided into parties, gradnally to contract an a∣version to those who give them not countenance enough by running into the same Excesses with themselves.
However, my Lord, I have very little concern upon me for any mens un∣reasonable heats, and extravagancies, as being sure to have them of my mind, when they return to themselves, and think soberly and Religiously on things, for then, of necessity, they cool into that very temper I here perswade to, In short, my Lord, I am sure
 moderation is a virtue, and a very excellent and useful virtue too, not∣withstanding that in our late years of extremities it was almost jested and rail'd out of Countenance. I am farther perswaded that the sincere practice of it on all sides would go a great way to the uniting us both in interest and affection, and that it more especially becomes those, of whatsoever Deno∣mination they are otherwise, to whom God has committed the Ministry of Reconciliation. On these con∣siderations alone I first Preach'd, and now, in Obedience to your Lord∣ship's and the Court's Command, publish this Discourse, which if it chance to dispose but any small num∣ber of Men to Amity, Temper, and Brotherly Love, and thereby contri∣bute to the support of our Holy Re∣ligion
 against its common and immor∣tal Enemies, I have my end, an end for which I am content to undergo all the unreasonable obloquy and re∣flexion in the World.
My Lord,
