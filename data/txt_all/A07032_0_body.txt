AFter I had finished the Trāslation of this Tragicall Historie (Right honourable) conteinyng the verie originall of the warres, in the now miserable lowe Countries, whiche before those troubles, were taken, as it were, to bee the Paragone, or rather, earthly Paradise, of all the Countries in Europe, whiche warres and trou∣bles, as myne Auctour hath sett doune, beganne in the yere 1559. and hath continued his Storie vn∣to the yere 1581: In whiche I finde, how, the moste righteous God, in his moste iuste Iudgement hath, with his roddes of corrections, I meane the Spaniardes, and certaine other Hispaniolized low Countrey men, fatherly chastized that people for
their greate disobedience, and woonderfull vn∣thankefulnesse, especially for the contempte of the glorious Gospell, of his deare beloued Soonne, our onely Sauiour and Redeamer Christe Jesus, so fre∣ly offered vnto them, besides all the reste of his no∣table benefites: whiche roddes and scourges, when he hath in his great wisedome, teawed vpon them, for their amendement, he will surely, like a tender and louyng Father, caste into the fire. VVhiche his fatherlike dealyng, should moue vs of the Englishe nation throughly consider of. For, in my simple opi∣nion (sauyng the iudgement of farre grauer, wiser, and learneder then my self) our staffe stādeth next the dore: For, where can wee read either in the olde Testament, or yet in any other prophane Historie, that euer GOD, dealte more bountifully, with any Nation then with vs, either for thynges needefull and necessarie, or delightfull and pleasaunt for this life. So that it maie vetie well be saied of vs, that we enioye a lande, flowyng with Milke and Honie. But especially, for the plentifull bestowyng of his moste holie and blessed worde emongest vs: whiche chief and principall benefite, is in suche sort by the greater nomber of vs so contemned, as that it must needes cause hym, one daie, make vs feele his hea∣uie
hād, as these low Countries, haue already elt, without we speedely returne vnto him, in true and vnfained repentaunce: for we must not thinke that if we fault in the like sinnes, but to reape the like Iudgement, because he is one and the self same God in punishyng from euerlastyng. No  use (sir) this historie declareth vnto vs, that the beginnyng of these troubles, came by reason of the refusyng of the Spanishe Inquisition, and of the defence of the state of Religion, whiche wee at this daie professe. And whiche, (the Lorde be thanked for it) euer si∣thēce the first blessed entraūce of her Maiesties most Godly and gracious gouernment, ouer this noble Realme of Englād, hath, by the good aduise of your lordship, & the rest of her highnesse most honora∣ble priue Counsell, been by her excellencie main∣tained and defended: I therefore, bothe because of your holie faithe, knowledge, zeale, and obedience, in the truth of the same Religion, (which, the Lord more and more, encrease, strengthen and continue in you) as also by reason of the aidyng of all those godly Ministers, whom Sathan, with his Impes and Suppostes, haue sought and daiely seeke, by all meanes possible to deface, as manifestly hath beene seene, and yet still appeareth: haue the rather for
these vertues aforesaied, presumed vpon your ho∣nourable courtesie, to choose you out, from amongest the rest of the right honourable, to be the Patrone of this my poore trauell, vnder whose godly pro∣tection it might marche, and be sheelded. Humbly beseechyng your Lorshippe not to regarde so muche my boldnesse in my choise, (for the whiche I craue pardone) as the ende, wherefore the Historie was first written, and for what cause also, I haue put the same in Englishe. And then I doubt not, but that your good Lordshippe will the better accept of the one, for the cause of the other. And, for your ho∣nourable and godlie dealyng, aswell to wardes the worde, as also towardes the godlie Ministers, you baue shewed your self to resemble, that valiaunt and milde leader of the children of Israell, Moses a verie true, and faithfull seruaunt of GOD, ouer his house and Churche all his life long. And so your Lordshipp still perseueryng therein, as you haue be∣gonne, shall not onely resemble Moses, but followe also the godlie steppes of that valiaunt aptaine Josua, Moses his successor, who, as we read in the laste Chapter of his Booke, after he had assembled all the people together, and recounted vnto theim the woonderfull thynges, whiche God had doen for
them, he exhorted them therefore, to serue the lorde in perfectnesse and truth: and not serue those Gods whiche their forefathers had serued, on the other side of the stood, and in Egipte, saiyng further vn∣to theim, that if thei thought it not good to serue that Lorde, that thei should chose that date, whom thei would serue. For (he) if you intende to serue the Gods whō your forefathers serued, or the God∣des of the Ammorites, in whose lande you dwell, you shall serue them alone for me: For, I and my house will serue the Lorde, who hath doen all these thynges for vs. VVhiche Grace and boldnesse, I beshe the Lorde our God, euen for his mercie and truthes sake, graunt you, and all her Matesties moste honourable and faithfull Counsellors. I shal not here neede (right honourable) make any lenger discourse of the first occasi of these troubles, other then as I haue in the beginnyng touched: for if I did, I should trouble our honorable eares with su∣perfluous matter, seeyng the readyng ouer of the same (which, if it might so please you, I gladly wish) will leade you to a more sufficient and better vn∣derstandyng thereof, whiche hath been one especi∣all cause, why I haue offered it vnto your Lord∣ship: But more especiall, to shewe vnto your good
Lordship some parte of my poore affectiō, and good will to wardes you, who desireth nothyng more, then in all humble and detifull maner, to doe you suche seruice, as  agree with your honou∣rable liking  so moste himbly take my leaue. Besechyng  Lorde further, so to rule and guide your harte and mynde continually in his faithe, feare, and loue, as hetherto he hath doen, that his glorymaie be aduaunced, his Churche, and this commonweale, partly by your meanes, in peace and Godlinesse, preserued and mainteined. London the xv. of Marche 1583.
