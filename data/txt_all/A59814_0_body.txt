May it please Your Majesty,
TO Accept this Treatise, which,
did the Composition answer
the Subject, would recom∣mend
it self to the Perusal of
Princes, who are the peculiar
Care, and the great Ministers
of Providence. For it is this
Good Providence which is the Security of the
Royal Throne, and the most perfect Patern of
a Just, and Equal Government, without Con∣tempt
of the meanest, or Partiality to the
greatest.

That Experience YOUR MAJESTY has had
of a Kind and Watchful Providence, and that
constant dependence the most Potent Monarchs
have on the Divine Protection, especially in the
great Shakings and Convulsions of the World, I
hope may excuse this Dedication, as neither im∣proper
nor unseasonable. And may the same
Good Providence, which has advanced YOUR
MAJESTIES to the Throne, and so signally
preserved the King from the greatest Dangers,
still preserve Your Sacred Persons, establish
Your Throne, and deliver You from all Your
Enemies. Which is the hearty and daily Prayer
of,
