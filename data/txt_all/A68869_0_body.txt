KNowing, and admiring (Right Wor.) the generall applause, and loue which you haue of your cuntrie, wonne (no doubt) by your vertues, seated in a hart of curtesie: And the experience which many schollers haue had of your kindnesse, neuer to be forgotten, but with vngratefulnesse: perswade me you wil animate my yong Muse, and vouchsafe to per vse the fruites, of my not curious nor carelesse stu∣dies: albeit I must confesse farre vnworthie your Wor: view; Vnlesse, (like the wisest senator) you would haue

your serious affaires intermedled with diuers delights, to driue away the tediousnesse of time. Then (most bountifull Mecoenas) if you fauour the effect of my la∣bour, it will serue you for a ieast, to refresh your wea∣ried mind, continually exrcised in matters concerning the common wealth. And thus I commend my Booke to your mild censure, and your selfe to your soules content.
