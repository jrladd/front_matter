SIR, by intermission of your noble exercises in feats of
Armes, and your studious endeuor emploied in forrein tongs: I must needes
craue at your hands, to vouchsafe some spare tyme (for your recreation)
in the intertein∣ment of your old acquaintance Pub. Terē∣tius: whom I
here present vnto you, in such and so much, English attire, as my poore
iudgement found fittest for him to be clad withall.
Whyle he liued at Rome, his most com∣pany, and
conuersation, was among the Nobilitie, and most of al other, with those
twoo noble and learned gentlemen, Laeli∣us, and Scipio
Africane: In like sort, after his death, his woorks were right currantly
accounted of, and highly commended, by the two Princes of eloquence, euen
Caesar,  and Cicero: as their own vvritings do
wit∣nes the same vnto vs. Therefore, sith Te∣rence, neither aliue,
nor dead, did euer vvant a noble Moecenas to protect him: I hope that novv,
being partly put into en∣glish, & hauing cheefly chosen you for his
Patrone in Englād: you likevvise, in regard of your noble birth, &
vertues, wil graunt him like curteous & frendly fauour, as by these noble
men in Rome, vvas heretofore affoorded vnto him. I trust also he
shal be neuer the vvoorse vvelcome vnto you, in that he is diligently
attended on, vvith my poore name: & like as my first attempt to
translate him, proceeded cheefly frō you, so look I that my labour spēt
on him, shal be fauorablie protected by your vvhich to me vvill bee a thing
much comfortable, & to you nothing cūbersome. And so, fully
re∣sting, & relying my selfe on your vvonted curtesies, I here make
an end: & besech the almighty, stil to increase & accōplish,
those his good gifts & graces, vvhich he hath pla∣ced in you most
shining & apparant.
At London. 
Decemb. 3. 1587.
