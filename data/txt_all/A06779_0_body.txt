AS there is an appoyn∣ted time for the end of all our Acts, and by the Almighties Decree once to dye; so hath it pleased God, (that this Reuerent Divine) hauing payd that debt to

Nature that we must all pay. And leauing behind him this new borne Babe, which might haue beene obscured and buried with him, had it not with a Religious Care bin preserued. And being brought to the view of the World, and past the Presse, I haue selected you, amongst many others, know∣ing you most fitting to Patronise this Worke; and do desire you to answere for this Childe, and to receiue it into your protection.
And withall, which was the chiefe motiue, hauing bin often Resident with you, and knowing in my selfe your pious and religi∣ous Gouernment in your Family, in offering vp your first and latter Fruite of Prayer and Thankesgi∣uing morning and Euening, made mee the more desirous to chuse You. The Subiect being of Di∣uine

Meditations, gathered out of the Holy Scripture, for the comforte of all oppressed and wounded soules.
For which causes, I haue im∣boldned to fixe your name as a Patrone of this and the like Sub∣iects: and present it (though vn∣worthy from my hand, beeing of this Subiect) as a token of my re∣spect, shewing my gratefull minde to you (if it came within my com∣passe) for all your curtesies besto∣wed on me. I do therfore presume to tender this my loue, only as a re∣membrance of my thankfulnes, and witnesse of my true meanings. I wil now cease troubling you, only tur∣ning my Writing into praying for your good health: thus taking my leaue, wishing you all happines in this life, and a correspondency in the world to come.
