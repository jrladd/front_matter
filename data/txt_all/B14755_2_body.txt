HAuing verie audaciously (though with all loyaltie and religiously) consecrated the middle and next preceedent part of this poore Pam∣phlet, to the gracious protection of our Soueraignes most princely cle∣mencie, as his Maiesties most pro∣per due; I haue now presumed vpon many reasons more then I mind to rehearse, to pray your Lordship to bee a protector of this latter part; not that I doubt, but that his Maiestie will also protect the same (as the former, & the whole with the part) but because I haue purposed with my selfe (though hauing no such president) to make a particular dedication of this booke (suppose as little and vnlearned as may be) according to the particu∣lar subiect of euery part.

And that is one chiefe reason, why I haue chosen your honour, being a chief Iusticer in this land, at your best lea∣sure, to consider of this same part, that particularly is ap∣propriate vnto your honourable place.
By title I grant, this part is called, The Kings reioy∣cing, but therein is shewed that the ioy of the King, shal be the subiects obedience, and the subiects obedience, shall be chiefly by the meanes of your Lordships, and others of your Lordships associats, in the seuerall seates of iudgement, the subiects well ordered gouernment; & specially by the good execution of as many good lawes, as euer had land, but how well executed in many places, or at least, how carelesly con∣temned of the vulgar sort eury where, I doubt not, your honour knoweth, and the hearts of the godly lament it.
I purpose not to be tedious, knowing your honours con∣tinuall imployment for your countries good; yet because I desire to be vnderstoode (and hard it is, and aboue my grosse capacitie, to be plaine and briefe) I therefore hum∣bly pray your Lordship, to permit a few lines more to bee drawne out, for the vnfolding of my minde, minding one∣ly to make knowne, two or three contagious diseases aboun∣ding in our Westerne Common-weale, the like may be ouer all the land.
The first is, that vniuersall prophaning of the Sab∣both, among the multitudes: but because herein I am much comforted, by meanes of the late religious Proclamation, published in part for the repressing thereof, therefore for that matter, I will stay my pen, in patiencie, and expectan∣cie of the good that I pray may come thereof: and no doubt will come, if it be as well executed in the Countrey, as it was right well intended from the Court. But here I may
 say of the bodie politique, as Physitions vse to say of the bodie naturall: The extreemer parts are euer coldest, when the naturall dispersed heate is drawne in, to comfort the heart: as contrarie wise when the heart is sound, and full of strēgth, able to send forth natural heate sufficient, then the extreame and externall parts, are full of of com∣fort and courage. We therefore that inhabite the extrea∣mer parts of this Countrey, are naturally subiect to this in∣firmitie: that the vigor and force of lawes (bee they neuer so good) leaue their best effect neare where they first spring out, and coole euer in carriage, and decay in execution.
But we are now in great hope (nature being in her best perfection, and in the spring of the yeare) the heate of that godly zeale, grounded vpon true knowledge, and hidden in the heart of our renowned king; will cause a dispersion of aboundance of good iuice to the chearing and refreshing of euery good member, euen the fingers and toes not ex∣cepted: but rather extraordinarily shall be comforted and regarded.
The next sicknes of sinne, that swims in our Countrey, is diuelish drunkennesse, which is dayly increased by an in∣sufferable sort of Alehouses (as our Country cals them) being alwayes maintained by the meaner sort; who are nourished by that tipling trade in idlenesse, and by means of their pouertie not powerable to free their houses from drunken Tossepots at any time, but when the drunkardes please: neither can the Tiplers keepe any good order in their houses, as by law they are bound, neyther any forfey∣ture can be taken from them, vpon their poore recognisan∣ces (hauing nothing to pay, and many times not bound at all) what coyle or ill courses soeuer the drunkards keepe,
 tossing the pots from morning to euening, and from eue∣ning to midnight, holy day and working day to them is all one.
The seede of this sinne, was first sowne in Citties and Townes, but now multiplied among the Commons in eue∣rie prish. And I know not how it should go further, ex∣cept like a sea, it ouerflowe the whole continent of this Country which is greatly to be feared; vnlesse it be spedily and prudently repressed, and redressed.
My pen cannot expresse, nor these Papers containe, the flouds of mischiefes, that dayly flow out of this Bac∣chalian Ocean. For, besides that it makes the drunkards senselesse in their sinnes, poore in their purses, beggering themselues and their posteritie, to speake nothing of their raging, and rayling in their drunkennesse vpon the Ma∣gistrates, and Ministers at large, and I would we Ministers might be quiet from disturbances in our charges, & chur∣ches raysed by them (to such an height of impietie are some of them come vnto, by reason of so long impunitie) Besides all this (I say) and many more inconueniences that I spare to speake of, there are two mischiefes and grieuan∣ces, that flow out of this floud, more faster then they will be bayed backe againe in haste.
The one is generall, the other more particular. The generall causeth corne and graine to grow to an excessiue prise, a greate deale more euery yeare, then there is cause; and when God sendeth his blessing in aboundance, for the good of many, it is turned to a grieuous curse, by a sinfull suffering of a few caitifes, to mispend it, and wast it more by one drunkard in a day, then would well suffice twentie honest laboring people a whole weeke: yea sure I am I speak
 within compasse, for I know more, that forty poore folkes liuing vpon their labor, do not drinke so much good drinke in a yeare (if at least they drinke any other then water) as one Tospot doth drinke in a weeke.
The particular grieuance, which growes out of this ge∣nerall is, that there is no measure obserued in selling of drink, & as ill order in the Country as may be for the assise of bread. Drink, the drunkards must needs haue, only fit fr drunkards; and that is such dagger-Ale (as they call it) as almost no ciuill honest subiect can abide to drinke it; by reason it is so raw fulsome and headie; and no poore crea∣ture can vsually buy much of it, by reason they vse to sell with the most, but a pint for a pennie; and so contrary to all law and conscience, in euery two pence, the poore are robd of one pennie; and no body inriched by it at the yeares end one halfe penny. This abuse in measure and maner of the drinke, I grant is somewhat redressed in Cities & townes corporate, where there is any good gouernment, but as com∣mon in country parishes as the Cartway. And when any poore complaines of this abuse, they say (those whō I thinke might redresse it otherwayes) complaine to the Sssions, when the poore people (God knowes) haue not so much mo∣ney as to bring themselues to that place: and if they had, perhaps they feare least they should bee put out of counte∣nance, when they come thither by some Cunstable, or some higher officer, that directly or indirectly, may beare good will to the offending partie.
The last, but not the least sinne that I mind here to speak of, is that grieuous blaspheming of the name of God, by cursed swearing and swearing curses; to speake nothing of periurie (seeing there is law to punish it, but too seldom ex∣ecuted)
 but as for swearing and cursing, rending and tea∣ring the blessed bodie of Christ in peeces, and blaspheming of Gods most holy Maiestie, this land doth mourne, and the Church and children of God do grone for griefe, that there are no stricter lawes made, to punish so cursed and crying sinnes.
God of his mercie moue the hearts of all Magistrates, according to their place & callings, to be mindfull of their duties herein, & zealous for Gods glory, more then for our Countries good: to whose grace I commend your honor, and all those that are deare vnto you. Recōmending also those poore complaints of mine made for Zions sake, and my Countries weale, to your honorable constructions, and gra∣uest consideration, to seeke and see the redresse thereof, as the place whervnto you are called shall require, and accor∣ding to the trust that is reposed in your honour by the king himselfe, in whose seate you in iudgement sit; so that his Maiestie may be eased, iustice equally ballanced, the vici∣ous punished, the vertuous supported, and euery loyall sub∣iect cheared and comforted thereby: which he grant, that hath hitherunto graced your honor with so good report in this world, & will not leaue you vnrewarded in the world to come, if you continue constant in a true course of iustice, accompanied with that meeke mistresse of mercie, as the cause and occasion shall permit.
