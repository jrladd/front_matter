IT is the saying of him (Right Worshipfull) whom God did mooue you once to honour, with this selected text, Moses my seruant is dead, to your great praise, Grauis est & arduus, si quis alius ex omni Theologia, locus is, qui est deformandis concionibus: by which (being vttered of a man of that learning and experience) I might be some∣what afraid to attempt the publishing of this Treatise, vpon such a subiect, but that I know it is acceptable to God (if we haue no greater gift to offer) to cast a mite into the Lords treasury; & I haue had also the approbation of some for my incouragement, both in the Vniuersitie & coun∣trie. A mite in a great treasurie is small in shew for encreasement thereunto, neuerthelesse it is some what, though but a mite. What I haue per∣formed in this labour for matter and method, it may by reading of it appeare: my labour hath
 not beene little, my intendement good. What∣soeuer it is (Right worshipfull) I presume to of∣fer it you, as a poore present, to testifie my hum∣ble and heartie thankfulnesse, for your manifold kindnesses and liberall fauours vnto me. I long ago offred it to your view, in a naked shape, and first conception, which euer since I haue beene better proportioning, and now haue thus clo∣thed it as it is. If before this, I had prepared it, I had not so long deferred off, or if my pouertie could haue affoorded a better testimonie, as in will I can wish, it should most gladly haue gone forth, as worthily deserued, vnder the honor of your name. Accept (Right Worshipfull) this la∣bor, and so looke vpon it, as you haue bene and are wont, louingly to accept of me: so shall you encourage me to further endeuors, and bind me still more in all dutiful respect, to acknowledge your professed and approoued loue and good will constant towards me; and to powre out my praiers to God continually for your pre∣seruation and encrease in all spirituall graces for euer. VVorsop this 16. of Iune.
