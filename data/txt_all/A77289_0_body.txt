Right Honourable,
THe fear of God and love of your souls, makes me set before you the words of Moses, Deut. 27.27. Cursed be he confir∣meth not all the words of this Law to do them, and all the people shall say Amen; which signifies, that God will stir up the people against men, for not confirming the Law, all the Law; and that there is a curse follows the not confirming of it. I have out of desire of your satis∣faction and encouragement, answered some objections which may beget high thoughts, exalting themselves against God: the Lord I hope will remove the hinder∣ances

cause delay in his work, and make the way plain before yee, and deliver you from reasoning with flesh and blood about prudential honors, profit and pleasure of the world; and the Lord answer all your Questions according to his counsel upon your Consciences. And first, the Lord season your thoughts with that of God when the people would be under humane Authority, as the Gentiles, 1 Sam. 8.7. they have not rejected thee, but me, signifying, that if men would set up Gods Law by humane Authority, they yet reject God from reigning over them: the divine Law administred by humane Authority since the types of Christ (as the Kings of Iu∣dah were) are past, and he come, is abomination, and worse then Deut. 22.9. sowing the field with divers seeds, ver. 10. or plowing with an Oxe and an Ass, ver. 11. or wearing a garment of linnen and woolen. O consider, Magistracy ruling under God, is higher and more honorable then that that is of it self with∣out God. But let us see what are the hinderances that God should not reign over us.
