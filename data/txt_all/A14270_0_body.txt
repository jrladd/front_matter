IF we shal consi∣der which thing I do oftentimes with my selfe, (right worship∣full Syr) of what dexteritie and sharpenesse of witte, the aunci∣ent Sages, and perelesse Philo∣phers haue been, with what indu∣strie and paynefull toyle they haue sweated in boltynge out the secret, and perplexed misteries
 of Nature, wee haue doubtlesse an vnspeakeable occasion to re∣ioyce, because through such theyr most excellent workinges we are allured to the knowledge of sun∣dry sciences: and yet we must, or at least we should more bewayle our selues, that contemplatynge such worthy documentes and vn∣fallible principles cōducing to the manifolde kindes of Godlynesse and Vertu, we doo little or no∣thing prouide for our wealth and commoditie, but rather vnto our greate shame and reproche con∣fesse our selues wretched bond∣men, & miserable captiues to the scepter and detestable seruitude of Ignorance. For amonge all
 such benefites which we so boun∣tifully at their hands haue receiu∣ued, no one semeth so excellēt, so precious, and so highli to be prai∣sed, and yet of vs lesse folowed and embraced, as is Morall phi∣losophy, a matter comprehending the perfect trade how to liue a∣monge men soberly and honestly, and so directly stakinge out the vndeceiueable boundes to the ca∣stell of Vertue, that none can be more apparant only Apo∣stolicall doctrine excepted. Of which when I pondered with my self how greatly the members of the Weale Publike euen at these our daies haue neede of, though the cancred infirmitie of a co∣wardly
 minde, had welnie sup∣pressed my conceiued purpose, yet aduauncinge against the ensigne of dastardly courage, & callīg to my minde the bening clemēcy that so brightly casteth hir beames from your countenance, and the prone, ready and willyng mynde, zeale and feruent desier towardes all Godly and vertuous learning, which all men consider, and I my selfe assuredly vnderstande, I concluded forthwith to finish this my Translation, that vnder the safeward of your Worships pro∣tection it may creepe alonge to the behoofe of my Countrey, and the better be fensed and fortified against the encountring, & wil∣full
 reprehention of shamelesse tongues.
Doubtlesse (right worshipfull sir) among so many your renow∣ned deedes of Godlynesse, this may not be the least, if you shall accept this my industrie and tra∣uell (such as it is) as a token of my hartie goodwill, very desirous hereby to shew my selfe zealous of a friend of so worthy a voca∣tion. And whereas larger mat∣ters cannot be compassed, these simple (such is my confidence) shal not be repelled & reiected: which if I shal perceiue to take a pros∣perous successe, henceforth more serious indeuour shalbe bestowed to atchiue greater if habilitie,
 thereunto be correspondent.
For I recken all this my labour very feble, and sclenderly, or no∣thinge able to preuaile, without your worship were the Fortresse hereof, whiche with all my good will and indeuour I dutifully ex∣hibit, not as to learn you any pre∣cept in which already you are not exactly seene, but by your famous reputation, such is my desier, to procure it the better credit with others. For when our English youth shall contemplate Morall Disciplyne to be ratified by so prudent and graue a Gentelman voyde of all troublesome moodes of mynde, polished with such ex∣cellent vnderstandynge, adorned
 with precious vertues, & practi∣sed profoundly in the experience of politik affaires annexed with Marciall Exploytes, no doubte they and all others will more lo∣uingly regarde the cause, as it is behoueable for them to doo, and more speedely will they settle thē selues to pursue those fruictfull instructions chiefly to be desired in a Commonwealth orderly, & discretly to be stablished. For herein is comprised a meane to procure rest and peasiblenesse in priuate life, to purchase estima∣cion and dignitie in bearynge of office, in euery degree to dismoūt vnrulinesse, & contēcious sturres to surprise al moodinesse of mind
 to extirpat incestuous concupis∣cence, and finally to reenforce, strengthen & support an impreg∣nable rule of vsage, and laudable behauiour. This boke is euidently the Glasse of intelligence: the Theatre of comely conuersacion: The Stage of honest demenour: the Treasure house of Ciuilitie: the Conduite to true Plea∣sure, and eternall Felicitie. It is the Casket of Ievvels: the Maystresse of Prudence: the Bulvvarke of equitie: the Palace of Fortitude: the Nurse of Sober∣nesse: the Parent of Comelinesse.
Which my attempt (howsoeuer done) I haue presumed vpon hope of full remission for my boldnesse to dedecate the same vnto your worship, although far vnworthy and ouer base to be receiued, the which trustinge you will none o∣therwise
 accept than did Ar∣toexerxes the Apple of the poore man, I close vp my matter, humbly besechinge Almightie God perfectly to guide you in the steps of his most holy wil, merci∣fully to graffe in you the light of true godlinesse, ardently to cause that Vertuous Lady of yours to burne in the pefect workes of Christianity, abundantly to re∣plenish you both with much worl∣des worship, wealth and prosp∣ritie, and after this transorie life to inaugure you both with the Blisfull ioyes of celestiall feli∣citie. Amen.
