SIR,
NONE can better demonstrate the Ʋsefulness of Methodical and Concise Book-keeping than a Good Accomptant. Your Dealings have suf∣ficiently gain'd You the Reputation of One; therefore I make bold to prefix Your Name to the following Sheets, as a means to recommend them to some of the Many Trading-People, who want Directions of that Kind. I hope, that as You always chiefly consult the Publick Good, neither my presumption, nor the short∣ness of the Piece, which may make it of more general use, will influence You to give it a worse Reception; the rather since I have been long ambitious of an oppor∣tunity to express in as publick a manner as possible the Obligations I have to You, and the hearty Zeal and deep Respect of
SIR,
