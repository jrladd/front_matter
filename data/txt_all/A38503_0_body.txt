TO prove the producti∣ons
of the Ancients ex∣traordinary
and transcendent
in their kinds, it would be
hard for me to bring a greater
Testimony, then the present
I heer make your Lordship of
these two small, yet Master-Pieces
of Morality. The vene∣ration

and esteem wherewith
they have been entertain'd
through so many Ages suffi∣ciently
argue, that Time, with
all its envy, hath not been able
to make any diminution of
their Original excellency.
For, who can reflect on E∣pictetus,
wihtout a certain a∣stonishment at his exemplary
Constancy? Who can think on
the strictness of his Precepts,
without framing to himself an
Idaea of that noble Insensibility,
which the Stoicks requir'd in
their Virtuoso? Who can view
him so indifferent and uncon∣cern'd
in the greatest emergen∣cies,

and not be convinc'd,
that there may be an undi∣stracted
pursuit of Vertue
through all the disgraces and
inconveniences of humane
Life? Who, in fine, shall con∣sider
him laying down Hu∣mility
for the Ground-work of
his Morals, and not be sur∣priz'd
at the strange illumina∣tion
of a Heathen Philosopher?
These, my Lord, were the
Characters which endear'd E∣pictetus
to all the lovers of ver∣tuous
action, and rais'd him
out of the miseries of Servi∣tude
into a familiarity with
Emperours. From which con∣siderations

I must acknow∣ledge
my self encourag'd to
recommend him, in his present
dress, to your Patronage, pre∣suming
that, with these Quali∣fications,
he must be kindly
receiv'd by a Person, who hath
prefer'd the splendor arising
from Christian Austerities
and Mortifications before all
the advantages of Nature or
Fortune; and with him the
sincerity and submission
wherewith I am,
MY Lord,
