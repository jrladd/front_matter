RIght honorable Lords, and Ladyes, I ho∣pe it shall not be any way distastefull, or vnpleasing to your honours, that a stranger is bolde to salute you, from beyonde the seas, and to publish your names, there, where your persons may be as vnknowne to others; as myne is to your selves. I have not presumed on this double dedication without all reason; for why? it is famously knowne, that you are the worthy examples of this subject, wherof I here treat. And I cannot but thinke, that they are the fittest Patrones of divine bookes, whome God hath made, the faithfull Patternes of the doctrine contayned in them. It is long since I have heard of your early, and happy proceedings in piety. Having now this opportu∣nity, I could not longer contayne in silence, but resol∣ved
to place you in the beginning of this litle booke, that they which reade, seeing such gracious and noble presidents, of the practise herein pressed, might have the more powerfull jnducements, to draw them, to doe the same. The Lord of heaven, keepe you all, in your most holy course, & bring you to the end of this happy race, that every of you may, (after all honorable falici∣tyes enjoyed on earth) posesse those infinite, and endles glories, prepared, for all that love his name, in whome I rest,
FLVSHING. the 30. of October 1621.
