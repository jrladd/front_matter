KInde Sir,
 I haue seen often∣times
men offring to snuff
acandle, haue against their
wils put it cleane out; and
an vnskilfull Chirurgian taking a

small greene wound in hand, hath
brought it to an olde Vlcer. I would
be loath, for my part, to imitate either
of these examples; for my intent is,
confession of the wrong I did you:
& an endeauor to make amends. I do
cōfesse that I did you wrong in print,
in my book of my Trauels, & now in
print I doe make you a publike satis∣faction,
For, I protest to God, that
I haue heard so much good report of
you, that I am double sorry that I was
so mistaken, and that I haue beene so
long time before I haue printed my
recantation. It was your Tapsters

want of wit, and my want of discreti∣on,
that was the grounds of my too
much credulity and temerity. For
his part, I wish him no more harme,
but that chalke may bee his best pay∣ments,
Thunder may sowre his Hogs∣heads,
Rats may gnaw out his spig∣gots
at midnight, & himselfe to com∣mit
his wit to the keeping of a foole
while he liues; And your hostlers, for
gaping so greedily like gudgeons vp∣on
me, I pray that they may euery day
mourne in litter and horsdung. But
these are but Iests by the way, for as
many as knowes you, haue told mee,

that if you had beene at home, my en∣tertainement
had been better: if it had
beene so, it had beene more then you
owed mee; and more then I at that
time could haue requited: but I would
haue stretched my wit vpon the cen∣ters
of Inuention, in the praise of
Innes and Inkeepers; I would haue
put the forgetfull world in minde of
the good seruice that Rahab the Inne∣keeper
did at Iericho, in hiding and
preseruing the spies that were sent by
Caleb and Ioshua; I would haue made
the obliuious logger-headed Age re∣member,
that the Redeemer of the

World did grace an Inne with his
blessed birth: What place then but an
Inne was the High Court of Heauen
and Earth, the residence and lodging
of the Immortall King, of neuer en∣ding
Eternity? This and more I would
haue done, but what is past cannot be
recalled, and it is too late to put old o∣mittings
to new Committings. And
so my noble and thrice worthy hoste
of hostes, I omit not to commit you
and yours to the protection of the
Lord of Hostes, desiring you to take
this merry Pamphlet in good part,
or in earnest of my better amends,

and as a qualifier of your iust
anger.
