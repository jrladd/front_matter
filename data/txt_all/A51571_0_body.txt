My Lord,
THE disadvantages that De∣dications have met with of late, by reason of the Flatteries that have been contained in them, have rendred them suspected of the same in∣conveniencies, although not in the least
 intended; That your Grace may not suffer in this too common a calamity, this Ensuing Treatise offers it self to come into the critical Censures of the World, under the Auspices of your Graces Protection: having the Aid and Countenance of so great and Noble a Personage prefixt, may in some manner take off the hard constru∣ctions of a great many. It is not to be questioned, but some will be apt to esteem it an audacious Enterprize to undertake to give an account of the Present State of Scotland, a Mo∣narchy so Antient, as none in the World can exceed; a Government so well Established in Church and State, that it seems by serious Reflection, that the Laws and Statutes of both
 are inviolable: I say, My Lord, I may be called into question why so great a Conamen became the Subject of my Studies at this time, when so many Learned and sagacious Scholars of that Kingdom have declined so useful an Undertaking: To confess ingeniously, my thoughts have been perpetually bent to serve my Country in some degree or other, whereby I might manifest to the World the re∣spect that is due to so Antient a Kingdom, in which by a Lawful and Legitimate Descent of the Crown to this present King, being an Inde∣pendent Monarchy, and an Imperial Crown; none of the European Kings can hardly equal. This De∣sign of serving my Country was
 much prompted, when none yet have published a Treatise apart concerning the constitutions of so well a Govern∣ed Kingdom: If I shall be so un∣fortunate as to suffer any way by en∣deavouring to satisfie the World what my respects are for so well a constitu∣ted Government, your Grace, I hope, will interpose for me, knowing that no sinister end was proposed.
My Lord, consider how regularly every Officer, from the highest to the lowest degree, move in the sphere of their Trust, being ready to execute the Commands of their Master the King. Consider how piously the Church is governed, in all things submitting to Lawful Authority: consider their Ec∣clesiastical Discipline, that scarce
 any of the least Enormities in Life, or Errours in Judgment, can scape the severe Execution of the Jurisdi∣ction of the Church. These things considered, with that due respect they alwaies had and have for their Kings and the Royal Family, will kindle in your Grace such esteem for this Kingdom, as those have had, who were your Predecessors of the great Honours you now enjoy.
My Lord, the Dukes of Lenox, of whom your Grace▪ only is the Re∣presentative, have been great Lovers of their Country, which they have te∣stified so demonstrably to the world by the several great Offices they have performed, that their memory to this day is in great esteem: They had al∣waies
 an immediate Access to their King, whom they were pleased to in∣form of the condition of his Loyal Subjects, and often did Patronize the Affairs, and Espouse the Interest of His Majesties good Subjects; which to this day cannot be forgot.
Your Grace needs nothing to ren∣der your Name famous in this King∣dom, being you bear that Honourable Title of Lenox, but an inclination to succeed them in such like performan∣ces; all their Transactions have ren∣dered them and the Successors of their Dignity Honourable in the Kingdom. Nature seems to warrant a Predi∣ction of Heroick Actions, which begin to appear in your Grace in these your greener years. Let then the thoughts of
 advancing the Interest of this King∣dom, become as Dear to your Grace, as it was to your Noble Ancestors of the same Dignity, that when become a Cedar in the Trust of the Affairs of State, you may gain the same Ho∣nour that is due to your Titles.
My Lord, The great Trust His Majesty is pleased to commit to his great Officers of State, is exceeding honourable, and becoming an aspiring Genius; most of the Antientest of the Nobility esteeming it a greater honour to have His Majesties Com∣mission for such Offices, than to bare∣ly enjoy the Dignity of their Honours. It may justly merit your Graces con∣sideration, that the great Officers of State have been of the prime of the
 Nobility, and have been very faithful in their Trust. It was upon this con∣sideration that I presumed to offer this Treatise to come into the World with your Graces Name prefixt, that it might be known that the Family of Lenox is not extinct, which is the great prudence of our Prince, that so Loyal a Family should not be buried in Oblivion: And likewise my de∣sign was, to give your Gre and the World a Testimony of the Esteem I have for a Representative of that Noble Family, who may in all pro∣bability acquit himself as becomes one of that Esteem and Dignity.
This small Treatise may afford your Grace an occasion to divert your self sometimes with the prospect of
 the things contained in it, and thereby make you easie to understand the constitution of the Government, and to declare to the World that this Kingdom is not inferiour to any in respect of its Laws and Statutes, whereby the King's Prerogatives are great, and the Property of the Subject is fully secured by Law, the People having great Liberties and Freedoms. If this n any way can supply your Grace with an Information of the Government of Scotland, then I have obtained what I so passionately desired, being in all sincerity,
