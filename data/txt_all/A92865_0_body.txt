I Have done Justice upon you because I saw evill in you; There is a holy One likewise in you, I must doe him Justice too; I have smitten you, and not you onely, but the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheeke: It pleases me to bruise him, and him as much to be bruised; tis his advan∣tage, and therefore he freely submits himselfe to be chastised: Ephraim is my dear son, a pleasant childe, For since I spake against him, I doe earnestly remember him still; Therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.
It grieves me to see you as a Woman with childe, big with justice, righteousnesse, reformation, &c. and know not how or which way to be delivered: Here is an arm stretched out to you that will gently leade them that are with young, and guide the blind into a way they know not. You have high and great designs, but are imprison'd in the darknesse of flesh that you can∣not get out into a clear and strait way; My intent is to open the two-leav'd gates and free you. I have opened the left alrea∣dy, and so turned aside that dark and evill spirit that lay in your way; & shal now unfold the right, which brings you into light, and so makes crooked places strait for you, &c.

You are upon the execution of justice, I would not have you goe blindly, passionately and rashly upon it; but accept this a∣nointing of God prepared for you, which will fill you with wise∣dome and righteousnesse. Ascend this Throne of majesty first, that is here set up for you: Arise from the common and darke nature of man into the holy nature of God, and then you will be able to judge; suffer this holy child Jesus to come forth, and then goe on in the name of God.
Reade it, and if you see a little truth in it, reade it againe; the light is dim, but tis a morning and growing light, and wil shine more and more untill perfect day. This I dare challenge of you from that great and publique trust that is committed to you, in which we have all a deepe share, from those high and weighty affaires that you are upon, of such mighty concernment to the glory of God, and the good of his people, from that inge∣nuity and freenesse that you have professed to receive advise from all, and to give satisfaction to all, and especially upon the authority of him whose name I here declare and set up, that you will not sleight what is offered to you, and lay it aside unconsi∣dered; but that you will give it due hearing And if in any thing you dissent from it, I may know it, and either receive or give satisfaction; or if it be doubtfull to you, I may have opportu∣nity to clear it; or if these things appeare true (as I believe they will) but yet at a distance from you, that I may by removing that out of the way that hinders you from fellowship with them, bring you into the power and possession of them; And to this end I am, and would be more.
