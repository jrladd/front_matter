HEere is offered to your view some helpe to the rea∣ding of the holy Scriptures; the vnderstanding of the Prophecies; but especially of the Estate of the Church, that so you may no longer bee carryed vp and downe with euery winde of Doctrine. But as you haue begun to attend vpon the word preached in England, and to practise those other Duties publique and priuate, our Church requireth;
 so it will be comfortable to your soules, and profitable to the Common-wealth, if you proceede, not turning to the right hand or to the left: Wherefore it is desired, that you would read it once ouer without taking notice of the quotations of Scripture; and hauing read once ouer, then try at the next reading whether the Scriptures bee rightly vsed, for that they seeme to be heere placed: and know that the last Translation is followed, as that by the which the Writer hath often confes∣sed, that he hath receiued more bene∣fite, then by all the Expositors that euer hee read. And thou art desired withall to esteeme that translation highly, and make it one cause of hear∣tie thanksgiuing to GOD, who hath giuen, & continued to vs a King that hath beene a principall mouer in such a great businesse; as also gifts vnto Men, that so much light is sprung out by their meanes. Albeit thou shalt
 happily meete with some priuate Spi∣rits that will bee ready to censure sharply; that, by the which the Church of GOD, will (certainely) at length reape great benefite. And so desiring thy feruent prayers for the aduance∣ment of Christs Kingdome, I rest yet a while.
Mar. 2. 1615.
