Right Worshipfull,
I Remember a Motto of your owne, which was this, Lunae radijs non maturesct Botrus: That the beames of the Moone are too weake and too invalid to ripen a tender grape, and bring it to maturitie; unlesse the sun also adde his heate, and cast his vitall beames upon it. How well this sutes with men of my ranke, that are Inferioris subsellij sacerdotes, J shall not neede to tell you. Alas, what are all a poore mans labours in the ministry, but as the Beames of the Moone; some light they may give in a darke place; but to ripen any worke for the publike good,

or to gaine any credit or estimation in the world, they are farre too weake and unsufficient, unlesse some man of worth that is instar solis in stead of the Suune to so poore a starre, will be pleased out of his owne goodnesse to cast some beames, J meane, some favour and friendly countenance upon him: Ʋouchsafe me therefore your gracious aspect upon my weake endeavours, and the God of Heaven pre∣serve your life, that you may continue like Eliakim, Esay 22. 23. As a fastened naile in a sure place; still to doe good workes in Gods Church on earth, till you be received up into glory with his Church in heaven.
