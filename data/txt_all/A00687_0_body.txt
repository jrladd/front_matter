ALBEIT my mynd nor purpois was not (richt Nobill and worthie Lord) to haue publischit this sermō at ony time, zit becaus it did not fructifie as I supposit it suld haue done, being (as sayis Ezechiel) lyke a tone or plesant sang to the heirers for a season, thair hartis in the meane time still going efter their couetousnes, prouo∣kit also be the malitious toungis of sū, & eirnestly requeistit be vtheris. At lenth I was compellit (for farther instructioun of the negligent heireris, the stopping of the mouthis of euill speikeris, and the satisfa∣ctioun of the incessant requeistis of gude and godlie men) to bestow and spend sum time & trauel, to put it in that same forme

& ordour, that it was spokin and preichit in befoir zour Grace. Quhilk quhē I had faithfully performit (as all thay that hard it, quhen thay sall reid it agane I trow will testifie) distrusting myne awin iudgement I presentit it to the Kirk now laitly assem∣blit in Perth the sext of August that thay quha (for the maist part) wer heireris of it micht iudge asweil of the soundnes of the doctrine contenit into it, as of my sinceri∣tie in the wryting thairof, and sa micht al∣low, or disallow it, as it meritit, vnto the quhilk besines the Kirk appointit Iohne Erskin of Dun Superintendent of Angus, M. Iohne Dowglas Bischop of Sanctan∣drois, M. Iohne Winram Superintendent of Stratherne, M. Knox Minister of Edin¦burgh, and Williame Christison Minister of Dundie, quha diligently red and appro¦uit the same, subscriuing it with thair han∣dis, in the Name of the haill Kirk, as a Ser∣mon consonant and aggreabill to Goddis word. Quhairof I haue takin bauldnes to publische it and that, vnder zour Graces name (to quhome the patrocinie & defēce of godlynes and vertew belangis) to ye end it may be the mair acceptabil to gude mē,Rom. 13. and that wickit men may be the mair af∣frayit

to calumniate or defame it, not that I greitlie regaird the iudgement of men, hauing the testimonie of a gude consciēce for my warrand,2. Cor. 4. bot that I iudge it profi∣tabill to seik all ordinarie meanis that be lawful to mantene the treuth and promot Goddis glorie.
Zour humanitie and gentilnes, quhairof not only I, bot almaist all vther men, haue experience, muifis me to be sa hamely as to offer and dedicate sa small a wark vnto zour Grace, douting nathing but that ze will accept & regaird it rather according to the qualitie & substāce thairof nor ac∣cording to the quantitie of it or ye persone of the wryter: quhilk quhen I sall vnder∣stād it will prouoke and incourage me to present zour Grace sum day with a greiter wark and a larger Volume as a perpetuall monumēt of my vnfenzeit lufe & affectiō to zour Grace. The Lord Iesus preserue ye Kingis Maiestie, comfort and assist zow yt ze may be a bill to execute zour charge to the glorie of God and the commoditie of this pure Realme. Amen. From Dunferm∣lyne the 20. day of August. Anno 1572. Be zour Graces humbil subiect and daylie Oratour.
