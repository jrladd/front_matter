My Lord,
THE Good Fortune which has always at∣tended me by Sea and Land, in my last Travels in∣to the Levant, incourages me to presume, that that same Providence, which more
 especially assigns certain Ge∣nius's to watch over the safety of such Persons, which it culls out for the Execution of the greatest Enterprises, cast an Eye upon me, from the very Moment that I de∣parted from London, with a Resolution to find your Lordship out, in whatever part of the World you were. That Providence doubtless it was, which having snatch'd me from the gaping Jaws of Dragons in France, and deliver'd me from several dangers and hazards which I ran both upon the one and the other Sea, diverted also
 from my Heart the Sharp pointed Dagger of a Megera, which Hell it self had vo∣mited up to overwhelm me at Venice: This Providence it was that staid a small Vessel at Marseilles for seven Months together, till the day that I arriv'd to embark my self for Smyrna, & to be there before your Lordship was to depart, in pursuance of other Voyages quite contra∣ry to the Advantage of your Affairs, and which I could never discover. At length being happily return'd home under the Conduct of your successful Patronage, after
 I had travell'd Six thousand nine hundred Miles by Sea or by Land in four Months time, I flatter'd my self, that in Dedicating to your Lord∣ship this little Piece, which departs from my Study upon a Voyage to the Republick of the Curious, it might find the same Good Fortune as the Author of it. Tho' indeed a stronger Reason oblig'd me to procure it this Honour; that is to say, the Grandeur of a Name which has preserv'd it self untar∣nish d in the Nobility of your Family for many Ages, even till this very day in
 your own Illustrious Person. For you are descended from that Great Hero, who assisted William the Conqueror to lay the Foundations of a Mo∣narchy, which the Sword of your Ancestors has ever since upheld with the hazard of their Lives. Witness that Thunder-bolt of War, the Deceased Earl your Father, who for having taken up Arms in the defence of the King his Master, had lost his Head, had not the Ven∣geance of Heaven crusht the Tyrant who had condemn'd him by the means of a small number of Judges and Ju∣ry
 Men, that then acknow∣ledg'd no other Law than Absolute Power. And your Lordship, the true Off-spring of so many Hero's, tracing their Glorious Examples, declar'd your self against your best Friend, so soon as he appear'd to be an Enemy to the King his Father, whose Arms your Prowess caus'd to be redoubted, both in Flanders and wherever else the Honour of his Com∣mands carry'd you. I could say much more, but that your Modesty obliges me to silence. But to what purpose should I be multiplying
 words, when your own Acti∣ons themselves sufficiently Proclaim the rest, as well as your Person, which alone attracts the Affection and Esteem of all that have the advantage to know those ex∣cellent Qualities with which God has endow'd your Lord∣ship; and of which I wish your Lordship a happy and long Enjoyment. Accept therefore I beseech your Lord∣ship this small Present as a Testimony of my Respect in the Quality of
