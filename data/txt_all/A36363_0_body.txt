Honoured Gentlemen,
SOme Reasons having been prevalent Motives with me now to expose that to open view, which at several times was by me publiquely delivered in your City; and considering what relations both the matter and my self have to you (the Representative thereof) I held my self obliged to present the same unto you, to whom it doth most properly belong. And I do entreat your favour∣able Acceptance thereof, desiring that
 it may not only serve you as your Remem∣brancer, but that it may serve me also as a pledge of my gratitude for the many favours which I have received from you, to whom I do professedly acknow∣ledge my self to remain,
