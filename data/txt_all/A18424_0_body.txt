THough (my good Lord) this
martiall History suffer the
diuision of Acts and Scenes,
both for the more perspicuity
and height of the celebration, yet neuer
toucht it at the Stage; or if it had
(though some may perhaps causelesly
empaire it) yet would it, I hope, fall
vnder no exception in your Lordships
better-iudgeing estimation, since sceni∣call
representation is so farre from gi∣uing
iust cause of any least diminution;
that the personall and exact life it giues

to any History, or other such delineation
of humane actions,  to them luster,
spirit and apprehension, which the only
section of Acts and  makes mee
stand vpon thus much, sice that only in
some precisianismes will require a little
preuention: And the hasty prose the stile
auoides, obtaine to the more temperate
and stai'd numerous elocution, some assi∣stance
to the acceptation and grace of it.
Though ingeniously my gratitude con∣fesseth
(my Lord) it is not such as here∣after
I vow to your honor; being written
so long since; and had not the timely
ripenesse of that age that (I thank God)
I yet finde no fault withall for any
old defects.
Good my Lord vouchsafe your idle mi∣nutes
may admit some slight glances at
this, till some worke of more nouelty and

fashion may conferre this the more liking
of your honors more worthy deseruings;
To which his bounden affection vowes
all seruices.
