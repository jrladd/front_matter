'TIs the glory of the Great and Good to be the Refuge of the Distress'd; their Virtues create 'em troubles; and he that has the God∣like Talent to oblige, is never free from Im∣punity, you, Philaster, have a Thousand ways merited my Esteem and Veneration; and I beg you wou'd now permit the effects of it, which cou'd not for∣bear, though unpermitted, to dedicate this youthful sally of my Pen, this first Essay of my Infant-Poetry to your ex∣cellent Self: 'Tis a Virgin-Muse, harmless and unadorned, unpractis'd in the Arts to please; and if by chance you find any thing agreable, 'tis natural & unskill'd Innocence. Three thousand Leagues of spacious Ocean she has measured, visi∣ted many and distant Shores, and found a welcome every where; but in all that vast tract of Sea & Land cou'd never meet with one whose Person and Merits cou'd oblige her to yield her ungarded Self into his protection: A thou∣sand Charms of Wit, good Nature, and Beauty at first ap∣proach she found in Philaster; and since she knew she cou'd not appear upon the too-critical English Stage without ma∣king choice of some Noble Patronage, she waited long,

look'd round the judging World, and fixt on you. She feared the reproach of being an American, whose Country rarely produces Beauties of this kind: The Muses seldom inhabit there; or if they do, they visit and away; but for variety a Dowdy Lass may please: Her youth too should attone for all her faults besides; and her being a Stranger will begit civili∣ty, and you that are by nature kind and generous, tender and soft to all that's new and gay, will not, I hope refuse her that Sanctuary I am too sensible she will have need of in this loose Age of Censure. You have goodness enough to excuse all her weaknesses, and Wit enough to defend 'em; and that's sufficient to render her Estimable to all the world that knows the generous and excellent Philaster; whilst this occasion to celebrate you under this Name, is both a Pleasure and an Honour to
ASTREA.
