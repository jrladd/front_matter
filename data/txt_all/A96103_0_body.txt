Loving friend,
THough I was put
upon some straits
of time, (other
occasions intervening when

this Sermon was to be
preached) yet at your re∣quest
to me to publish it,
and the desire of some of
your Relations to whom I
stand obliged, I knew not
how in civility to deny.
The subject of this follow∣ing
discourse, is, The
Saints desire to be with
Christ; and surely if
Christ be all in all, Col.
3. 11. all marrow and
sweetnesse, no wonder that
they who can claim a pro∣priety,
desire possession, and

thirst after the embraces
of that dear Saviour, in
whose presence is fulness
of joyPs. 16. 1. as touching the
present sad providence
wherewith the Lord hath
exercised you, let not your
heart despond; though God
allowes you tears, yet you
may not mourn without
hope, nor beyond mea∣sure;
let them that weep,
be as if they wept not,
1 Cor. 7. 30. If God
hath given you Christ,
you have enough, you need

not envy any living, or o∣ver-grieve
him who is
deadIn uno salvatore omnes flo∣rent gemmae ad salutem.; The star-light of
Relations is superabun∣dantly
recompenced with
the golden beams of this
Sunne of righteousnesse.
If these few lines ensuing
may do good to any, adding
some holy oyle to the flame
of their affections, unglu∣ing
them from the world,
and fixing their hearts
more upon the Lord Jesus,
I have what I aimed at;
I shall leave all to the

blessing of the Almighty,
and rest,
From my Stu∣dy
at Stephens
Walbrook. No∣vemb.
3. 1658.
