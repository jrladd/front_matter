GReat is the worth of thy triumphing Fame,
With Faith, Hope, Loue, in thy sweet soule inâˆ£shrind,
A endlesse world shall eternise thy name,
And crowne the glorious vertue of thy mind.


Thy feruent faith to Christ is so inclind,
Which makes ritch hopes vp to the Heau'ns aspire
From thence thy loue, descends in ruthfull kinde,
And helps the poore in their distress'd desire.


Long may thou liue, and long may God aboue
Increase, confirme, reward, faith, hope, and loue.
