Enuy his onely enemy, will not deny, but that
the comfort of his wisdome, (combined with all
morrall vertues) was the rising sonne of England,
and that his mortall abilities, were generallie ad∣mired,
and especiallie feared where the Englishe
are not beloued: your Lordship needeth not this in∣formation,
to knowe his inestimable valewe, when
he was like to possesse your temporal honors
after death, and was sure of your vertues in his life.
His losse will make his goodnes best knowne,
and soone mist in England, notwithstanding the
recordes of his life, are profitable for our posteri∣tie,
and holy workes, that reuiue him after death.
My remembraunces of this worthy Knight, now
with God, I hūbly present, vnder your honors pa∣tronage,
to whom he was most deare, and neare,
that your Lordshippe allowing of my god intent,
I may deceaue the enuious findefault, of his Idle
censure.
The Lord be with your Lordshippe in all your
affaires, for whose health, and honorable prosperi∣tie,
I doe dayly pray, and to the ende will constant∣ly
remayne.
