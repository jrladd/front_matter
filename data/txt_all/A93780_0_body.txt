SIR,
IT hath pleas'd your Highnesse to com∣mand this Sermon to the Presse, and mee to be your servant: what you have ob∣serv'd from either, that might incline you to so much grace and favour, I know not; unlesse it were my plaine
 dealing with the Times. This (in∣deed) your Highnesse mentioned with a deep sence and relish. Would God the madde world knew it. Cer∣tainly it were enough to stop the foule mouthes of some: enough to warme the honest hearts of others. God Almighty so compose the pre∣sent troubles of this State, that the Government thereof may stand the surer for this shaking; and continue and increase his graces in you for the glorious support thereof, when it shall please him to lay it upon your shoulders.
Thus prayes
