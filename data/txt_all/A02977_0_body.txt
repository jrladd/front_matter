SYR, I SEND you heer a short trea∣tise of the Gout, wri∣ten by one Balista a Frenchman, and dedicated to a great Phisitian in Fraunce.
It came by Fortune (beeing as I think not any where els to be had) into my hands, which for the bene∣fit of diuerse my freends troubled with that disease, and partely for mine owne recreation, that was somthing delighted with the wri∣ter (in as good maner as I could) I

Englished. The verse in Latin is not very eloquent, and therfore no meruail though the translation be rude and vnpleasant.
But sure his Method and order is not in mine oppiniō to be dissalow¦ed, but rather much to be commen∣ded. I haue noted him in such pla∣ces as I thought conuenient, and would haue farther augmented him but that I thought it not good to be to curious in an other mans woork.
Such as it is: I send it you and commit it to your good allowance and protection.
