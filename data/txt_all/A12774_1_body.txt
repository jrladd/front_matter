MOst braue and noble Ladie, the things that make ye so much honored of the world as ye bee, are such, as (with∣out my simple lines testimonie) are throughlie knowen to all men; namely, your excellent beau∣tie, your vertuous behauior, & your noble match with that most honourable Lord the verie Pa∣terne of right Nobilitie: But the causes for which ye haue thus deserued of me to be honoured (if honour it be at all) are, both your particular bounties, and also some priuate bands of affinitie, which it hath pleased your Ladiship to acknow∣ledge. Of which when as I found my selfe in no part worthie, I deuised this last slender meanes, both to intimate my humble affection to your La∣diship and also to make the same vniuersallie knowen to the world; that by honouring you they might know me, and by knowing me they might honor you. Vouch safe noble Lady to accept this simple remēbrance, thogh not worthy of your self, yet such, as perhaps by good acceptance therof, ye may hereafter cull out a more meet & memorable euidenc of your own excellnt deserts. So recom∣mending the same to your Ladiships good liking, I humbly take leaue.
