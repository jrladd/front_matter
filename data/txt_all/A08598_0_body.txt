IT may be thought great boldnes in mee (right Ho∣norable & right Worshipfull) beeing one altogether vnknown to you, that I should thus presume to seeke the patronizing of these my poore endeuours, vnder the protection of your Honorable and Worshipfull coun∣tenaunces, and so in some sort I doe my selfe acknow∣ledge. But if the name and nature of my booke be but rightly considered, and your dignitie of place and office therewith iustly equalled: that boldnes (I hope) wil be thought in mee but modest dutie, and your kinde accep∣tance heereof, the true testimonie of religious deuotion. You are chosen in this Citty as cheefe Magistrates for this yeere ensuing, first, to see that God may be rightly honoured, her Maiesties lawes iustly administred, the people in peace & loue discreetly gouerned, and sin and
 iniquitie duly punished. All which depending one vpon another, as the parts in Musique doe, and that you your selues, (with the rest of your worshipful brethren) are the ground of this Oeconomicall Musique, for all the rest that be vnder you to sing sweetly in tune by, (as example is the best guide to order, and order can∣not bee kept where example wanteth:) euen so this Harmonie of holy Scriptures, (in my poore opinion) doth rightly challenge you as Patrons, beeing drawne from the true foundation of your seated authoritie: for whatsoeuer is not to Gods glory, ought most carefullie to bee shunned. In this regard I humbly desire, that your Honour and Worships will but listen to this Har∣monie, and giue it such entertainement as it worthilie deserueth: not for any matter of attribution to my selfe any way, but for his sake to whose honour it is meant & intended: who blesse you and yours with all happinesse in this world, and make you partakers of farre greater blessednes in the world to come.
