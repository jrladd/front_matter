TReadinge the wea∣ry March of this lothsome Laborynthe, besieged with the horrible Hoste of Satan our Anciente foe: wee finde (moste re∣garded
 Prince) to the blessed Soule, no waie so sure a shielde, and For∣tresse, as the vnspeakeable vrtu of daiely Praier: the same deckings mans brickle Body with the per∣fectnesse of true Glory, assistinge his decaied partes with sounde healthe, nourishinge his vitall Spi∣rites with sweete confirmed hope, geuinge the furious Fend of Hell, pininge pounishmente, and moste bitter conflicte: And beinge faith∣full, hūmble, and feruente, is not onely to our Celestial Father, the moste sweete Oblation, and Sacri∣fice,
 but to euery true Christian, a moste blessed comfortable exercise: wherein, as wee laie abroade our yrksome transgressions by naturall defectes to the Almightie, requi∣ringe the Fortresse of his Holy Pro∣misse to defende vs from this poli∣tike, and wicked Warriour. So by often conference as it were, euen with the Deitie it selfe, wee are trained Souldiers to the Battayle of eche affliction.
By Praier, Dispaire is auoided, and the horrible sinne of Presum∣ption ouerthowen, all Impurenesse
 laide aparte, all Rancour foregot∣ten, and rigorous Enuie dissolued to milde Loue: els shall wee wante the thinges wee praie for.
Then if Praier doothe onely en∣force vs to a reformation of our misdeedes, purchasing vs a stately Mansion in the House of God, free from the heauy yoke of Sinne, and Deathe. The Holy Augustine rightely spake these woordes: Ora∣tio est Animae Sanctae prae∣sidium, Angelo bono Sola∣tium, Diabolo Suppliciū, gratum Deo Obsequium,
 & Poenitentiae Religionis Laus tota, perfecta Gloria, Spes certa, Sanitas incor∣rupta. And also Cassidorus: Oratio posita est, per quam Ira Dei suspenditur, Venie procuratur, Poena refugi¦tur, & Praemiorum Largi¦tas impetratur: Et nullus indè respuitur, nisi qui in ea tepidus inuenitur. Let vs therfore presente the Highest with this Incense of true Prayer, disco∣ueryng our mindes, and confessing our vnwoorthinesse, with assured
 hope to receiue the benefite of his sweete Promisses, due to eche peni∣tente Soule that asketh in the sim∣plenesse of harte with teares, and stedfastnesse, reiectinge all trem∣blinge hope, whiche then gaineth our true perfection therein, and also confirmeth these further woor∣des of Augustine: Si pura, & casta sit Oratio, Coelos pe∣netrans, vacua non redibit. O sweete Sentence: nay, ô more blessed trauaile, so imploied, where nothinge is founde so necessarie to the loste Childe, nothing more plea∣sant
 to the afflicted man, nothinge more profitable to the weake de∣spairinge minde, neither any thing so well beseeming euerye estate, ar∣minge them with able force to en∣counter the wicked Serpent. A∣gainste whose malignities, as the Heauenly giftes of prudente skill, and Learning are shrined in Roy∣al Seate of your vnspotted Life: as∣sociate with moste lowely nature he true Victors of Regale re∣nowne, exercisinge eche vertue in proper kinde, that iustly maie pro∣cure you euerlastinge rewarde of
 vndefiled Battaile: so vnder Bul∣warke of those Angelical beauties pearsinge highest poincte of starry Firmamente, and mounte, I saie, of Heauenly Humilities, vniuersally resoundinge all Europe, and ma∣kinge Englande specially blessed: im imboldened to laye before your Highnes, these woordes of Salo∣mon Kinge, touchinge this effect, who called his housholde to Praier, and commended the force thereof. Because (saithe he) I communicate with God of good thinges, I will haue Honour of the Elders, I wilbe
 founde a ready younge man in Iudgement. In conspectu po∣tentium admirabilis ero, & facies principū mirabun∣tur me. Create is the force of Prayer to a Prince that loueth it, greater to him that vseth it, grea∣test to him that needeth it: The comforte whereof (moste puisant Prince) holdeth backe my ouer fee∣bled spirite, from her laste steppe to that vglye Hell of desperation, deeming there was neuer earst in∣felicitie in any degree, equall to mine, whose foes by sinister sugge∣stions,
 haue not onely vsurped the rewarde of my single intent, and true seruice: but Zoylus hath stirred the ministers of your heauy wrathe against mee, to the aban∣donyng of my desired libertie, sup∣pression, with vtter ruine of my poore sequell, and buried my halfe liuinge Carkas in the graue of deepe forgetfulnes, where my voice is hoarsed with cryinges, and my tongue fainted with vtteringe the griefe of my sorowfull minde: No doubte, a iuste scouge to the hid∣den faultes of my passed life, but
 to the very case of my committing, wherein I am wounded, maymd, wronged and lost, it needeth a true Confession, and not a false Defense in any thinge by mee thought or donne, to the preiudice of your Ro∣yall person, Crowne, State, or Di∣gnitie: I professe before the Al∣mighty, as innocent as the Childe vnseparate his Mothers intrayles: Teste sepso, whose wrathe I craue in Iudgmēt to my thoughts, of any harme to your Highnesse, wherein amidst my sorrowes, yet I ioye, sithence my miserable matter
 concerns your excellencie, and my punishment, at your Noble plea∣sure, continued or released, whiche in weary state, I attende powringe my pitiful plaintes before the Ma∣iestie of the Highest, to dissolue your woorthy harte to accustomed leuitie, and to fortifie abade of these sweete woordes in your Roy∣all breaste, rendred to a sely suiter, that your Highnesse woulde ioy with any inferior of my Friendes, in the triall of my truthe. Wherin O gracious God, what els dothe your Highnesse, but scourge the
 schorchyng, Phaëton that goeth too faste, and wantes a slower reigne, for whilest you wishe my truthe, whiche hath no want, I waile my vnwoorthinesse, and fall into deepe Hell of Desperation, (Nihil e∣nim est, quod tantum me terreat, nec est aliquidquod tantum me delectet, Quā∣tum huius tuae in me boni∣tatis commemoratio, ter∣ret, inquam me, indignitas propria, sed me delectat haec tua virtus & excellen∣tia) beinge assured, my whole stu∣die,
 force, trauell, nor aduenture, shal euer be able to Cācell the Re∣cordes of your Princely thoughtes, touchinge my true Loyalty, whiche no Antecedent of passed life can accuse, nor any poisoned tongue in true touche, by present annoye.
What more woorthely beutifi∣eth the Maiestie of Kingely rule, aduaunceth wisedome to her Hi∣ghest steppe of glory, or can so sweetely make the chiefe Harmo∣nie of al good gouernment, as a∣gainste the wofull afflicted, to de∣liuer Clemencie: to eache offender,
 Mercie: to the vertuous Rewarde: and in causes doubtfull, to su∣spende iudgemente. Truely, these are they, whiche not onely satisfie the Heauens and Earthe with a right aspecte of Diuine Iustice, but are chiefe moouers, that the longe abandoned Virgin Astrea, hath resigned sacred seate, to become your handmayde to highe Glory, through al Prouinces, and strēgth∣neth my feeble partes amid these conflicting daies, encreasing chiefe delight, to nourishe healthe against infection of place, vbi.

Vnda locusque nocent & causa valentior istis:
Anxietas animi, quae mihi semper adest.
Thus doe I striue (moste seemely Soueraigne) tossed in the Sea of many troubles, bruised with the Ankore of griesly griefe, and meished in the tumblinge toyle of frowarde Fortune, thirstinge vi∣ctory to the onely ende, that prote∣cted by your Vertue to wage true triall of my owynge homage, and faithfull harte, before the Imperi∣all Seate of your cleare, and able
 Iudgement: where I doubte not, but a single truthe, whose ende hath no beynge, and so Priuileged, that shee triumpheth of Time, and not Time of her, and will in fine aduaunce her selfe, and by hir Iu∣stice free mee of suspition, and so wholy discipher my honest intent, true, faithfull, feruent, and dueti∣full care of your Royall Person, Common Weale, and happy Go∣uernment, as my dealinge therein equally hearde, shall keepe weight with the truest, and moste faithfull Subiect, belonginge to your State∣ly
 Rule, with the remainder of my life, founde by ready shewe of owynge Homage, and duetifull good will and forwardnes, woor¦thy your Princely Clemencies ad∣ded to my chokinge calamities, by your Heauenly disposition, with∣out the whiche, I had estsoones pe∣rished, where yet beholde I reste, like subiecte to the daiely perill of suche ensuinge Battaile, as obedi∣ent to your further will and plea∣sure, whereunto I onely caste the Ankore of my well doyng, and hope of my health. Hauing gathered
 without Fenne, or Paper, this hād∣full of pietifull Praiers, that geue my pininge ghoste, her beste solace: Whiche effecte, I laie before your feete, to whiche boldnesse (moste triumphant Prince) if you adde desired Pardon, allowinge the ripè grayne of my good wil in the rude∣nesse of this roughe acte, I shall deeme my selfe thrise happy, and imboldened to presente your excel∣lency, with the larger partes of my imployed trauell whiche I truste, shall better agree your Highnesse farther likinge, and woulde haue
 made it my rather oblation, in steede of this small peece, but that I wante apte instrumentes to pul∣lishe the same, and contagion of place, that ofte annoyeth, and de∣priueth my sences their duetifull office, but shall neuer enforce mee from the bounden duetie of true llegeance, as knoweth God: to whom of daiely custome your Ma∣iestie repayreth to be eased of the yrksome burden of ordenary sinne. At whiche time, if your High∣nesse vouchesafe the perusinge these fewe thinges, by mee selected, there
 shall appeare the vnfeined griefes I suffer. Which knowen to your Ma∣iestie, I haue my desire, attending a better exchaunge at your Prin∣cely pleasure, when I shall moste willingly Sacrifice my Body in eche duetifull seruice. Deeminge my life moste happy, when death shall chalenge the same in your quarell, for tribute of your woorthy Me∣rites: in whose effectes you shal ne∣uer repent, neither your Highnesse conceiued good in thoughtes, nor committed compassion, in geuinge reliefe to my drenched state: which
 if I further finde not, Gods will be donne, your Maiestie preserued, your Enimies confused, with all Peace, Tranquilitie, and Happi∣nesse, whilest you liue in this soyle of sorrowe, as exile from our Hea∣uenly Father, whose ioyes (throug his deere Sonne) God graunte you participate after this Life, to the heyght of your desires, and deapth of my daiely Prayers.
