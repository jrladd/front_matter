SIr if vertue and valure were as sure to be com∣mended and magnified of many, as it is spited and maligned of most, I needed not too haue troubled my selfe with the writing vnto you the true reporte of our General S. Iohn Norries his late honourable seruice in Britaine, where∣in hee hath especially done acceptable seruice too the french King and greatly honnored hir royall Maiestie and re¦uiued in those partes the reputation of our nation and coun∣try, in performing many and sundrie valient exploytes there: but cheifly with that lately atempted against the impregnable forte by Croyzon, which the Spainardes made of purpose too countermaund the Castle of Brest, and to make them selues maisters of that great hauen, and to the end you may aparent∣ly see how little time he spent in vaine, and with what difficul¦tie it was atchiued, I send you a Iurnall of all that Sir Ihon Nor¦ris did, sence his last ariuall at Penpole in Britaine to this time which I can assure you to be most true: Being my selfe an eye witnes & noting daily euery daies actiō. Pardon me if you find me not so eloquent in writing as the discourse requiereth, and the worthenes of the victory doth merrit. A soldior hath small retoricke, for whosouer followeth Mars taketh little aquan∣tance of the Muses, yet being loth deserued honnor should be obscured and cast in darke obliuion I haue bluntly presumed to write y the naked truth, hoping you will take my good∣will in good parte, and yeeld honnor his due desert, though rudely deciphered. And thus wishing your welfare I end.
