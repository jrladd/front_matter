May it please your Lordship, &c.
IN obedience to your just Authority, which I have alwayes, in my small Sphere, endeavoured to maintain, I have hardned my self against the Censures of the World, to comply with your desire to Print a mean Discourse on a Noble Theme. God grant that you may, under the Supreme

Being, and a most excellent King, perfect the Thorow Reformation according to Law, which you have begun; be as Chaâˆ£ritable, and Kind, as the following Sermon was designed, by the Preacher, to exhort you unto; and alwayes Loyal to that Most Protestant, and truly Gracious, Monarch, who gave you your Commission; whilst I remain,
Right Honourable, &c.
