IT is not only for the sake of my self and children, but also for the sake of you and yours that I have pub∣lished this little book; but especially out of respect to the glory of God, that we may leave a seed to bless him in this world, when we are glorifying him in the better world; it will cost you but a little money to buy it, and but a little time for you and your children to read it; if those of you who are able, do give to every one of your children one of these books, and do likewise bestow some of them upon the children of the poor, this will be no ad∣vantage to me; and when ye come to give your account, will be no loss to you: I am a lover of children, and have often lifted up my heart in prayer to God for them, where I have seen them. I wish this may be a blessing to you and them; pray that we may leave that Religion which came
originally from the Father of Jesus Christ, and is reveal'd to us in the Scrip∣tures, to our posterity, and that they may have hearts to live according to the rules and principles of it, more than we have done. Farewell.
June 6. 1681.
