Truely Honorable,
AS two great riuers, when in one they meete
Makes faire and fruitful, all the neighbouring lands,
Euen so our Country (when you too did greate)
Felt strength and comfort by your clasping hands,
Your bounties, plenties, beauties, wit, and loue.
Makes both your Honors, to slane wondrous bright,
In Court and Country; and me first did mone,
At your faire lampes, to giue my candle light.
And since you loue the pious life of grace,
I'm bold to bring this sacrifice to you:
It is diuine and therefore claimes a place,
In your great bossomes. Truth sayth 'tis her due,

To lodge in the best roomes of euery brest,
Yea euen in Princes, for because it brings,
Th'externallioy, and the internall rest,
Truths life, and Honor, and rewards makes kings
Of meane men; and this part which I present
Vnto your Honors, is Iehouahs voyce,
Descending to our terrence continent:
Vpon th'election of his Bride, (his choyce;)
Wonder not why I write, you are the sunne
To Chesters neighbours, 'mongst whom I'm a starre:
(Though dim) and therefore I should haue begunne,
To tender my affection sooner (farre)
Since your faire Country is my friendly nurse,
I owe this loue vnto your Noble nest,
What treasure I entoy, I will disburse,
To make both loue and seruice manifest:
For you if I can write, or Preach, or pray:
Command me freely, for indeede you may.
