O KING live for ever, and be graciously pleased to take in good part this little Stone, and this little Booke, which is an Inter∣preter of the Vertues thereof. A Stone if your Majesty regards the price, to bee lesse esteemed then the meanest Gem. But if you respect its use and profit in the Arte of Navigation and Dyalling, yea and in Divinity it selfe; it is not to be counted deare, though in compari∣son of the most precious Diamond.

If the quantity of it be considered, it scarce exceeds a little clodd of Earth: But if we consider the re∣spects it hath to the Arctick and Antartick poles to the Tropick cir∣cles and the Aequinoctiall, then it equalls the Terrestriall▪ Globe, here∣upon it was deservedly called by the name Terrell as Gilbert the founder of this Magnetick disci∣pline hath termed it; If wee looke upon its outward shew and beauty, there is no smoothnes, no bright∣nesse in it, as in Pearles, it hath no splendour, no transparency, as o¦ther precious stones: therefore by Claudian it is cal'd Decolor ill co∣loured. And by Berchori ferrugi∣neus of the color of rusty Iron, but if the inward force and vertue of it be considered, it doth exceedingly surpasse the most precious stones, for which cause by ancient Grecians

was called  strong or as fa∣mous amongst stones, as  was amongst men, by the latter Gretians it was termed , mirificus a stone that doth wonders for it is inrich' by nature wih wonderfull and secret endow∣ments▪ it produceth admirable ef∣fects, it cares the Gout, Cramp, and Head-ch, if we give credit to  bodeus and Pictorius, ho hath made a Comment upon him, unto which the same Author adds, that it makes such as possesse it. Eloquent and acceptabe to Princes, O me s∣lice, svera diceret. O happy me if that he speake the truth. By your Majesties good leave, I dare pro∣mise this with good assurance that if your Majesty alone were the possessor of it, it would easily make you the Monarch of the whole world, for to them that passe the

Seas, this stone is another Neptune, and most faithfull conductor to the havens, and to them that tra∣vell by land another Mercurie, a most certaine guide in all journyes, especially because it is the most powerfull ruler of the Iron genera∣tion, which easily subjects all other mettals, and in that respect also, it is the most excellent pat∣terne and lively Embleme of your most admirable Monarchicall and mild Government, for this was alwayes my constant and undoub∣d opinion, this I alwaies thought with the greatest Politicians and Divines, and openly professed it before all men, that an hereditary Monarchy, (such as this is, under which it was my happy lot to draw my vitall breath, to enjoy all sorts of blessings, and to live in all god∣ly conversation and tranquillity,

is by many degrees the most profi∣table, and most praise-worthy of all formes of Government, which are any where used, or that can be imagined; unto this Monarchi∣call Estate I have alwayes wished well, as he knoweth who searcheth my heart and reynes. Furthermore it is approved by the consent of all Writers, and by the Mottoes of many Emperours, that a Magne∣tick manner of Governing is most safe, most acceptable, and most commodious, both for Princes and Subjects, for as suger, (accor∣ding to the testimony of Ferne∣lius) doth the very same things, and all in a better and sweeter man∣ner then honey doth, so a Magne∣tick affection doth effect more then flavish terrour, and a filiall love of subjects, is better then ser∣vile feare. Behold how the Load∣stone

subdues to it selfe all kind of Iron, which otherwise is scarce wrought upon, by files, hammers, and fiers, it is done, not by force of Armes, but by helpe of love. So the Iron is held in a duiful subjection, being united together by the mutuall bonds of friend∣ship; in like sort lt the people see and consider with me how the Iron dust, that confused multi∣tude, growes tgether ino one body, under the Loadstone, as it were their King, how it stands stil with a kind of quaking affright∣ment, and doth cover it in the forme of a shield, it doth com∣passe about the Loadstone, after the manner of a Guard, it doth yeeld sustenance and service unto it, as the Bees doe to their King or Ma∣ster Bee, which is without a sting; a cleare and illustrious Hierogli∣phicke,

of Christs Dominion over those that are his, a ype whereof he long since exhibited in David unto whom he gave a name derived from love, of whom that which is singular and rarely befalleth Princes, is recorded, that all which the King did, seemed good in the eyes of all the people; the King of Kings gran that our people may universally obey their King, the Magistrate▪ and Prelates, with such radinesse of wil, that thy strive among themselves by mu∣tuall emulaton, how one may goe befoe, and excell the other in performing the due Offices of subjects: the same gracious God grant that your Majesties Empire may be to your enemies and adver∣saries adamantine, but Magnetick to your ubjects and friends, and that your Majestie may be gr∣ciously

pleased to favour him, who if by Art or hap, he had found that Stone, which they com∣monly call the Philosophers Stone, would have presented it with the like inclination and alacity, as he doth most humbly and wil∣lingly present, and dedicate this Loadstone, together with this short Commentary upon it, which indeed of right and de∣ert is due unto your Highnesse; for to whose service should hee consecrate this dear Loadstone, but o his dearest Soveraign. This Load∣tone, a Stone of great vertue, but to a great and vertuous King, this Sea Nptune or Guide; but to the Lord of the Seas which com∣passe so many Ilands, this power∣full and mild Ruler of Iron but to the most Mightie and Clement King; so doth he

professe, who wished unto your Majestie the celbration of a hundred birth-dayes in this world, and one joyfull never ending day in the world to come, which shall ever be the prayer of him who is, of
