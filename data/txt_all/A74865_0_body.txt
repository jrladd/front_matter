Gentlemen,
TO whom may I better presume, to offer this small Pamphlet, then to your selves? for whose sake it obtained its originall being, and if it be any wayes serviceable to you, in defending you as a Bulwarke against all the inticing allurements of that generation of Vipers (for as the Viper is the death of its parents, so do these Vipers undoe more in this City by their exorbitancies, then all other casualties whatsoever) I shall have attained the utmost limits of my ambition; And to those, that by no admo∣nitions, will bee premonished, I shall onely say, that,
Qui ante non cavet, post dolebit,
He that bewareth not in time,
He shall too late repent his crime.

For my owne part, I have verified this Distich,
Nescio quid sit amor, nec amo, nec amor, nec amavi,
Sed scio si quis amat, uritur igne gravi.
Peradventure it will seem strange, that one of our Profession, should dare to adventure upon the publike Stage in this scribling Age; yet what I have written, I have written; And if any shall expect Apologies, they are like to bee frustrate of their expectation: I am confident I shall offend none, but such as are con∣scious of their owne guilt: And it is below my Ge∣nius to crave pardon of them. I dare not enlarge, lest I should make the Porch so great, that the House runne out at the doores: I shall onely adde, that if you please to extend the benevolent aspect of your favour, to this poore Pamphlet, it shall ingage me to requite you with something that shall be more worthy of your acceptation. In the interim I remaine,
