To my Honoured Friends, Madam Marsh,
and her Pious Son and Daughters.
AT the Motion and Desire of your (since De∣ceased)
Father and Husband, my Worthy
Friend, I did, after the Solemnization of his Funeral,
deliver the following Discourse to you in Private. And
in order to Common Good, I have here made it Pub∣lick.
The Father of Mercies accompany it with his
Blessing upon you, and all others into whose hands it
shall come, that thereby Love to and Faith in Christ
may be promoted, together with Holiness of Life and
Comfort at Death. That you may not be unmindful
of that King of Terrors at his greatest distances, nor
terrified by him in his nearest approaches. I was
greatly pleased to see your gracious Deportment under
that Afflictive Providence, which deprived you of one
so desireable, and that you were duely affected with your
Loss, yet sweetly submissive to your God. Though the
Cup was bitter, you did not faint nor murmur. It was
indeed a Mercy that you enjoyed him so long, for he was
full of Dayes, and had a flourishing old Age. And it
may be a Comfort, that you shall see him again in
Heaven, where you shall Eternally rejoyce together
in God. That your Souls may prosper, your Graces

increase, your Comforts abound, your Daies may be
filled with Mercy and Duty, and your selves at last
received into Glory is the Hearty Prayer of
