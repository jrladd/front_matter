My dear Country-men,
THe ensuing History properly belongeth to you, in a double re∣spect: First, Because it was your Blood and Trea∣sure that raised the subject of this' Discourse to Supremacie. Then, Secondly, your Backs bore the Burthen of his Greatness; therefore it's fit that once again

you look back and view with a full aspect, this Gentleman, General, Politician, and Pro∣tector. To limn him to the Life in all these Colours, is too much for one Pencil; therefore I onely present you the Epitome of great Cromwels Actions, from his home near Huntington, t his Tomb in Westminster. The work is not unlike Homers Iliads in a nut-shel, yet may it serve for a Memento of our e∣ver-to-be-lamented unnatural di∣visions.
The main scope of this Dis∣course, is a continued series of Tragical Scoenes, with Comical▪ Interludes lately acted in Eng∣land,

Ireland, and Scotland: herein I indeavor to keep pace with Truth, so near as possi∣bly it may be traced. My aim is Moderation, as the surest way to hit Affection; there∣fore have I chosen it be∣fore partiality or egregious En∣comiums, which do not become an Historian: for Flattery is meer folly; no better (I am sure) can it seem to the sight of a wise man, who knows that Panegy∣ricks must profit the maker, or else the same Quill will again drop Gall in a Satyrical strain upon his reputation.
My Indeavors herein (I doubt not) will render some profit to

the Reader; though much plea∣sure cannot be expected, when the Theme is nothing else but boxing about of Governments, as men do Balls in a Tennis-Court.
Countrey-men, Read over this small Manual, and then consider how finely you have fought your selves into LIBERTY. Vale.
