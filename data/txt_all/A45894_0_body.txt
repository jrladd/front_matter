Right Honourable,
WIth all due humility that is ow∣ing
to so High and Great an
Assembly and Authority, I ap∣proach
once again, after a long,
and yeares attendance at your
Door, begging, that as you
have had the favour, and if I may say so, the indul∣gence
of the Almighty upon your Actions; so you
will be pleased to answer him in doing Justice. The
Sentence I lye under is hard and severe, it dispos∣sesses
me of all that is dear to me, which is, my ho∣nesty

and good affection to the State, and indeed
un-mans me; I am in a manner my own prosecuter,
for how have I sought to have my businesse re-heard?
If it appear foule in your eyes, I shall sit
down under your censure, if I appear a just man▪
let me crave justice from you. God hath placed you
in the highest seat: no man prayes more heartily for
you; do then, I beseech you, though it be for a friend,
yet as Judges: delaying of Sentence may be seve∣rity.
I do not presume to say any thing of your for∣mer
Sentence; I know they that could Report the
first busines in five days, and hinder Col. Downs's
Report nine Months, have stood in my way and
delayed mee from being so clearly represented to
you, as I hope it will be made appear I ought to be.
For Gods sake let me once have justice, 'tis all I beg,
and then I shall account my losses, intermission of
Calling, and time spent, a Gain; For truly, if I
had not a Confidence of my innocency, I should not
have dared to solicite at your Tribunall, and to
that Supreame Authority, for which I daily send up
supplications to Heaven, Being indeed,
