Most Reverend Father, and mst Honoured Lord,
I Am emboldned to address this Divine Dirge of a dying Swan as his last breath, into your Graces hands; Nor indeed could I, as I humbly conceive more pro∣perly recommend it to any person living, not onely be∣cause your grace is Primate of the Church and so cheif of his Coat, but also because under your graces most happy government he drew his first University breath and breding, being some time aservant of that Colledge in Oxon where your Grace was the Honoured head: and so truly might be called a St. Iohns-man born, So I shall not need to insist any further in any Character of his Piety and parts, having had so long a relation to your Grace and Government: In the next place I must be bold to present this small peice to all you my Lords, the Bishops, and others his Fathers, and Bretheren in the Church of England: Nor need I otherwise recommend his memmory to your Lord-ships than that he was one that had the honour to were your girdle and was not onely a beater down of Treason and Rebellion in his Pulpit, but in the field, where he durst do, and did as much as any man of his coat. Nay he did not onely Preach but proclaim against the horid murther of his late Sacred Majesty, before the very face of the Actors of the most
 bloody Tragedy, and he forbore not to tell them of it, when it was done in open congregations, for which he together with his whole family were no little sufferers: but now, O how he would have rejoyced to see this day!
In fine, my most Honoured Lords, I humbly beseech you through the bowels of Jesus Christ, that you will not onely meditate on the souls immortallity which I doubt not but my Husband does happyly enjoye, and so will your Lord-ships after him but also an Immortality of our bodies, the poor widdowes and poor fatherless Children, now all ready to perish if not releived by your Lord-ships most charitable goodness, and so as these shall be oblig'd to your Lord-ships for ther temporall life, they shall pray for all Temporall and eernall good things to be bestowed upon your Lord-ships. So your Lord-ships may be pleased to accept this as the widdows mite from,
My Lords,
