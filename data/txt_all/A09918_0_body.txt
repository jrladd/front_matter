AS Satan the old antient enimie to al truth, hath not, or doth not surcease to be himselfe, wan∣dring without werinesse, seking by al meanes, that he may at the least, in some sort, make full the warrantise of that horrible iudgement, a∣gainst himself and his, where the smoke of tor∣mēt ascendeth for euer, in brusing the heele of that blessed seede, endeuouring to dismember that bodie of his appointed limmes, which being knitte togither in the vnitie of one spirite, throughe the bonde of peace, doth grow vp into the fulnesse of one heade Christ Iesus, standing out in his long continued course of rebel∣lion, especially ayming at this marke, to darken or bedimme the day light of Gods glorie, whose maiestie he can not beare, that himselfe might see aduaunced in the palpable darkenesse of oure depraued being, wherof no time or age, since the worlds creatiō, amongst what, or what sort soeuer, but haue bene experienced at the ful, as is easily seene, if the case be considered, by discent in al the wayes of the worde of life, by whiche the most mightie and eternall maiestie of our God, hath directed and brought downe his beloued people vnto this gray headed estate, of these misera∣ble dayes wherein we be. And as he hath through all ages tofore seriously laboured, to haue and holde captiue in the bonde of in∣tellerable seruitude and spirituall slauerie, in the palpable darke∣nesse of Egipt, the whole multitude of men, holding it the rea∣diest waye to winne his hoped intente, to bring vpon them the great floud of forgetfulnesse of Gods benefites, and in the coun∣tenaunce of an Angell of light, to steppe in betwixt the surpas∣sing brightnesse of Gods glorie, and the true acknowledgemente
of our naturall being, an euident experience of that sorowfull se∣paration betwixte God and man: so in these drossie dayes of in∣accomptable euils, he now hath encouraged himselfe, with a big∣ger force, added to his malice, the long experience of his wicked wayes, and to worke out his purpose according to the time, hys fiercenesse is augmented, by many thousand degrees, as who be∣stirreth himselfe most, when he is nearest the end. As the tymes of gold, of siluer, of brasse, and of iron, wherof Daniell speaketh, did each succeede and exceede others, not in succession of time, but abundaunce of iniquitie, and fierce wrath against the people of the highest, til the stone cut out of the mountain without hāds should aduāce the name of his ielousie, in their standing and irre∣couerable ouerthrow So founde this lothsome Leuiathan none easier accesse to breake in vpon the Lordes familie, with all out∣rage as shamelesse sinfull man, yea of that purple strumper, and Babilonicall whore of Rome.Apoc. 27.4.5 And for his more hope of successe, he hath of olde enforced all his endeuours to this purpose, that the name of the highest might not be knowne amongst his peo∣ple, and to stoppe the passages, and ramme vp the wayes of the worde of life. And in this case in the faire outshewes of manye vntruthes, he hath promised beaurie, but payeth bandes, preten∣deth truth,Antichrist the ope. Ap. but inhaunteth falsehood, and in steade of the wel∣springs of the water of life, in the person of his dearest friend, hee rendereth nothing, but the foule stincking and impoysoned wa∣ters, with the wormewoode of false doctrine and lyes, issewing from the welspring of iniquitie, the seate of the seauen headed beaste noted with the name of blasphemie, an habitation of Di∣uels, an holde of all foule spirites, a cage of euery vncleane and hateful bird, whose wickednesse to claime, & their wiillingnesse to yeelde, who haue receiued the marke of the beaste, that hath powed out to all nations the wine of the wrath of hir fornicati∣on, the high presumed title of vndoubted iniquitie, hath brought vpon the worlde the greate haruest of sinne.Supm . But eternally, bles∣sed bee the name of our God, who kepeth his promise for ouer, maketh lighte to shine out of darkenesse, and to the great com∣forte
of his chosen, hath confounded the counsel of Achitophel, and brought our hope out of bondage. But eftsones the Romish Marchauntes, on their ministers behalfe, bestirre themselues, bi∣cause their marte is staid, and their filthy dregges not warranted to so common sale, as tofore they were. And least the whole glo∣rie of our deliueraunce, not so muche from ciuil seruitude, as that spiritual bondage, wherein Satan helde Captiue the whole mul∣titude of men, might be ascribed to the Lorde our God, on the behalfe of his, he aduanceth man against the almighty, and plea∣deth the downefal of Adam too, but eyther in part or the death of Christ but in sufficient, & so adding one iniquitie aboue the rest, denyeth the Almightie in his being, or concludeth him in the al∣teration of tyme, to ascribe to man the mightinesse of his owne deliueraunce, and set him freely in the hande of his owne counsel with will auouched without impeachment. And these practises of Satan, as they are vniuersall,re wil aobed by the apist on the D . and stande out against the Lorde in the furtheraunce of his Gospel, which is by election, and auou∣ched in time and place, when it may do mischiefe, so hath myne own experience approued true, that our warfare is not againste fleshe and bloud, but spirituall craftinesse in heauenly things. In which, my manye conflictes with Satans craftie ones, aboute the freedome of the will of man, wherein they laboured the ouer∣throw of Gods election, the soueraigne staye of our assured safe∣tie by Christ the Lord, the almightie vouchsafed me the feeling of the felowship of his. And as the Diuels drifte and Popes pur∣pose, to deface the truth vnder the hande of his smeared Catho∣liques, in the dispersed questions at Hluelia, was easilye ouer∣turned by the prouident goodnesse of our God, in the happy tra∣uell of the reuerend Father M. Bullenger of Zurike, and the op∣probrious slaunders and broched contumelyes of Fontidenius and Cardillus against the truth, the glorious Gospel, the glad tydings in the bloud of Christ, were stopped of their course, and abridged of their hoped intent, by the praiseworthye indeauour, and pub∣lished traull of Iohanes Fabritius: so were the blasphemous mouthes of certain Sycophants against the Lord, in the person of
that reuoumed father in al the world M. Caluin, sone stopped by the reuerende in Christe M. Theodor Beza of Vezel, whiche his sayd worke, whē I had pervsed to my great comfort and ena∣blement against the foe, I beganne eftsoones to pittie the wante of suche a worthy worke to mine owne countriemen, to whome the Lorde hath not giuen the vnderstanding of tongues, though manye and mightie blessings in his heauenlye truth. And least I might be found to haue buried my poore talent in the erth, whē it might do good, or deuoyd of that Simpathie, which the people haue that inioy the Lord, I employed mine endeuour by all the spare time that I had from other necessarie affaires, to acquainte this the said renoumed & worthy worke, with our mother tong, and that especially for two sortes of people, the one, are those of the Lords secret ones, who yet wander in the way of ignorance, and eftsones take part with the wicked cause, for lacke of helpes, in that they finde no meane to withstande the batteries of Satan in the enemie. The other are those, whom god hath alredy sealed in the felowship of his truth, by the testimonie of a good consci∣ence, and assured zeale to serue the Lorde in Sion, and yet want enablement to stande for the Lorde. But amongst these especi∣ally for the helpe of them, whose place of present being doeth re∣quire at their hands their better enablement to further the Lords poore ones, in the way of life, whome they haue wonne without warrantise, whose diligence in time to come God graunt may be so much, as their vnderstanding small, whom inchaunting Circe, the worlde hath bewitched, and broughte into a compasse be∣yond themselues, and made them retchlesse in loue of the Lord, and as fallen vnder  and sonke down in selfeloue, haue thrust themselues into the Lords sanctuarie, the dyreful downe∣fall and destruction of many soules, as it is written, Vbi non est vi∣sio, dissipabitur populus, where there is no preaching the people perishe, or without walking in the warranted waye, haue lefte to call to the Lorde for labourers, and made stones breade, and in their blind liking, haue with Vzza stept to the vpholding of the Lords Arke, in the time of staggering, but to their owne decay,
whose condemnation sleepeth not, whereof some in deede haue Vrim, but not Thummim, some Thummim but not Vrim, and ma∣ny, none of both, whose song will be with Lysimachus, if repentāce be not a remedie with speede. That this my poore trauell mighte be set in warrantize against Zoylus, and the carping foe, to passe forth, for the accomplishment of that good that is hoped for, I eftsones most humbly recommend it to your Honors protecti∣on, whose zeale for the Lords family, I haue eftsons experiēced to my great comfort, in the time of my being within your iurisdicti∣on in Lincolneshire. The Lorde increase in you his manye and mightie blessings, & multiply vpon you the measure of his grace, that as he hath chosen you into the forefront of his haruest, and giuē vnto you amongst others, the chiefest, and especiall charge to see his fielde furnished with labourers, so he continually make ful the measures of his own mercies in your hart, that the end of al and singular our attempts may be lyned by the word of life, to the aduancemāt of the name of our eternal God, by the faythfull furtherance of the free passage of his word amōg his people, that such as yet wander in the wildernesse of most palpable blindnes, or sense lesse obstinacie, for wāt of workemē wel armed with ap∣purtināces incident to such soucraign embassage on the lords be∣halfe, might be brought home to the vnitie of one simplicitie in Christian profession, that Gods glorie maye bee aduaunced, his Church vniuersally profited, and your Lordship, with others in such place discharged to stand boldely before the maiestie of the Almightie in the day of Christ. VVhich thing, as for many bene∣fites receiued, I am most bounde, so I most humbly and hartilye craue at the handes of our eternall father by Christe, to whose merciful assistaunce and mightie prouidence (remayning to per∣forme vnto you al the duties that I may) I do most humbly com∣mitte you.
