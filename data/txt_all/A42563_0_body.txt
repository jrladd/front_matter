May it please your Lordship,
HAD your Lordship no other Rela∣tion
to the following Papers, which

of owning to the World how much I have

he would be so gracious to his Church, whose
very Foundations are at this time so fiercely
attacked, as to restore you to perfect Health,
and to grant you a long Life to defend Her
against those Enemies of Hers with whom she
now struggles, with the same Success that
you had formerly against the Papists her
standing Enemies. I humbly beg your Lord∣ship's
Blessing, and am
