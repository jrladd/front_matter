MY LORD,
AS it lies in my Duty to Congratulate Your Lordships Accession to the Pretorian Chair; amongst the many unquestion'd Merits that have promoted You to that Dignity, I must joyn with the Acclamations of all that have the Honour to know Your Lordship, that You stand so qualified for Magistracy, that I may truly say, in Your Advance to the Seat of Justice, You come Experienced to the Ballance You hold: Your Commerce with the World, and indeed Your whole Life has been such, that the Scales of Justice have been Your constant Standart.
The Dealings of Your Lordship with all Mankind, have al∣ways stood that Test, That a hard Bargain, an Over-reach, a Rigour or Extremity, those too common, and indeed reputed Venials in Trade and Traffick, have been so utterly Stranger to You, that from Your Equality, down to the poorest Person concern'd with You, You never made a Murmurer. A hard Word of Sir John Fleet is a sound that never came near You Gates: The common Voice that speaks Your true Worth and Goodness is, without an Exception, Universal: And if 'tis possibl Your Lordship can have an Enemy, he that is so, must renounc common Humanity, and write Barbarian to qualifie for that Name

Your known Integrity has been so remarkably signal, that Chaffering or Factoring have been thought so unnecessary Preli∣minaries in dealing with Sir John Fleet, that 'tis enough You are the Mouth and Oracle both of Buyer and Seller: Equity and Justice are left to Your own Decree; insomuch that You sit Chancellor, when You trade Merchant.
And, that so fair a Character of Your Lordship is no artful nor borrow'd Colours, but Your Natural and Substantial Com∣plexion; besides the Concurrence of all Tongues to give You this Right, we have the particular Smiles of Providence to joyn in the Testimonial; Your extraordinary Affluence of Bles∣sings, and so early and quick an Advance to such a Mass of Prosperity, being undoubtedly the peculiar Showrs of Heaven in Reward of so much deserving Virtue.
But now, my Lord, to usher Your Lordship to Your Inaugu∣ration, and the publick Manifestation of the General Applause that waits Your Lordships Enstallment; here, as too humble an Intruder, I leave You to Your VVorthier Train of Vota∣ries. But, in all the Honours of the Day, the proudest of Your Triumph is Your Reception of Your Royal Guests; and the Richest of Their Feast, the hearty Zeal that entertains Them; it being indeed (to summ Your Merits) no little Pride to all Good Men, to have Two such Princes served by such a Magi∣strate: In which Post of Glory I leave Your Lordship, being in all Humility,
MY LORD,
