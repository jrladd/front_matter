SIR,
HAd my Endeavours born a Symmetry to my desires, this which casts it self at your feet, had been worth your eye; but such is my mis-fortune, that what I designed to be responsible for the interest of that service I am bound to pay you, being priviledged with your protection, renders mee much more a debtor to you, and Meanders mee into such a labyrinth of Obligati∣ons, that they only leave mee capable to evince to the world how great my gra∣titude would appear, were your merit
less. (Generous Sir) having afforded mee your protection, I shall boast a fame next to that of your Loyalty, which is so well known, and in the most dangerous attempts hath been proportioned with a courage no less true than the oppugners designs were traiterous. Your Soveraign hath ac∣knowledged, and your Country oweth you for actions beyond the amplest Characters of Art to express. Take this (Sir) as the preface to that respect I owe you, and grace the front of my labours with your acceptance, an honour that transcends my desert, and shall ever be acknowledged Superlative by
Sir,
