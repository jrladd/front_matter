Madam, my dear Cozen!
I must of necessity, return this Bo∣some-Piece into your Brest again, lest (unhappily) my Cold Affections Congeal so warm a Subject. Truly, I am apt often to Censure my self with being a bad master to so Divine a piece; and fancy that it longs to be remitted Home, where it may follow it's wonted Exercise with a more Zealous Divinity. Take it, then, Madam, my dear Cozen! but not with a Belief, that it has made no Impression on my obdurate Heart; but, to the Contrary, since thro' it's Merit, and the Author's Worth, I have made it to the Life Ʋniversal.

As to the Late Reverend Mr. Stanley's Letter, I have Presum'd to Intitle it; A Bosome-Piece for Communicants, &c. For, What Brest-Plate so Armor-proof against the Assaults of Death and Hell, as the blessed Sacrament of our Re∣deemer's Body and Blood?— A Brest-plate as well to be worn by the Fair Sex, as others, to the making 'em Champions over the Vassals of Sin, and compleat Heroesses in Di∣vinity, under the Banner of their GOD!
In fine, the World may give a large Guess how Divine a Soul the now Happy Author had, and how close his Zeal kept him to the Altar of his holy Jesus, by the following Letter; which is, at your Command return'd Home in a more Ʋniversal Dress, from him who is,
Madam, my dear Cozen!
