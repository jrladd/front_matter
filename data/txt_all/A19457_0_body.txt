ACCORDING sir, as ye bad me haue I inglishid this li∣tle booke, of the of∣fice of seruauntes, but nat accordynge as I wolde it were, bothe to con∣tent tendereares, and also for mine owne satisfaction. Trusting your goodnes wyl with as free a minde receiue it, as I also went abowt it, albeit in many places I found the same as a glasse to see myne owne fautes in, (as I can nat tell, and am glad to belieue you ment it so)

but thereby I fynde my conscience doble discharged, in confessing the one, and fulfillynge the other. And I pray God geue your maistership longe soo to serue, as in a lesse de∣gree we your ser∣uauntes owght, and woulde doo.
Your humble seruaunt
Tho∣mas aloner.
