TO THE SENATORS & SOULDIERS, CITIZENS & STRANGERS,
To whom This SERMON was (As to its main SUBSTANCE) EXHIBITED FROM THE PULPIT, IT'S NOW (WITH MUCH ENLARGEMENT) PRESENTED FROM THE PRESSE, FOR THEIR SERIOUS PERUSAL.
By A MESSENGER from CHRIST, A MINISTER of the GOSPEL, THOMAS WILLES.
Blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it, Luk. 11.28.
If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them, Joh. 13.17.
