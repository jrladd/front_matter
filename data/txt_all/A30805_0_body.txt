Honored Sir,
THE Encourage∣ment these Wa∣ters receiv'd last Year from your own Experi∣ence

and Commendation of 'em to others, did in part Naturalize 'em; by gaining such Repute, that they were prescrib'd by several Physicians in Town to their Patients, and that with good Suc∣cess. For they alone wrought several Cures, as by the Testimony of the Doctors does ap∣pear.

I have bin therefore very industrious to keep open these Salutiferous Springs, that they may flow to the advantage of many. And I doubt not but under your Pa∣tronage their Medicinal Virtues will raise 'em to such general good esteem that they'l become the Metropolitan Fountain.

'T will not be diffi∣cult (besides Experi∣ence) to make it ap∣pear from Reason, that Medicinal Waters thus by Art prepar'd, will excel the Natural. But that being part of the ensuing Tract, I'le not here forestal the matter. But acknowledge your Obligations in permit∣ting a Rivulet of this

Fountain to have its Eruption among your ingenious useful Ʋnder∣takings, which that they may continue to prosper, are the unfeigned wishes of
Honoured Sir,  From my House in New-street by Fet∣ter-Lane near the Five Bells.
