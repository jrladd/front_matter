MAy it please your good Lordships, & the wor thie minded Gentlemen of England, in all humi∣litie to giue vs leaue to remember you of the anci∣ent honor, whereby many forrein Nations, but espe ciallie this Realme of England, hath benlong hol∣den famous for victories atchieued, vnder the con¦duct of their right prudent & valiant Princes & Captaines, by the wonderful effect of Archerie: & to deplore vnto your honors and wisdoms, the discōtinuance, yea (almost) the vtter extirpation ther∣of, within this Realm: And withal, our own miserable estates, who with many other poore Artificers that haue had their maintenance therby, are (in great nomber) brought to vtter ruyn and decaie. In the rowme wherof, is crept in the noysome vse of vnthriftie & vn∣lawful Games: Wherfore, to stirre vp in your honors and worthi∣nesse, a due commisseration of these great mischiefes, we haue cau∣sed this Abstract to be taken out of former Writers, and from right credible and true Reportes: Not intending heereby to insinuate to our selues any such fauour or reliefe within this Common-wealth, for our priuate auaile, as to innouate any supperfluous thing, or to driue the same to any charge at al, vnlesse the quallytie of the Sub∣iect whereof we intreat, shal in your graue discrescions be adiudged to be worthie therof, more for the honor & sauegard of her Royall Maiestie, her knigdoms and dominions, then for our priuat regard.
For if (in your iudgements) the Examples and Reasons in this Briefe contained, shal not be holden of waight and momentwor∣thie the preferment of Archetie, then shal we be pleased rather to sincke in our owne miseries, then to become vnprofitablie burthe∣nous to our Prince and Countrey.
And therfore, do wee (humblie) intreate, that we maie bee with sauour, permitted to propose the same, to your Honours and Wise∣domes: to th'ende, that if they shall seeme forcible, and worthie
 your considerations, it wold then please you with a fauorable zeale to further those proceedings her Royall Maiestie, hath and shall take for our reliefe herein, which is, that by your good endeuours, her Maiesties forward Subiects in the exercise of Archerie, maie be cherished, & obstinat persōs refusing to be reformed (disposing thē∣selues rather to practise vnlawfull Games) may be chastned & cor∣rected according to the forme of the laudable lawes in that behalfe made & prouided: nor is it our meaning, to derogate from the re∣putation of the vse or excellence of any other strong or approoued weapons fit for the wars, be they of fire or others, such as your wis∣domes & counselles haue prouided to be had & ordained: but that both (not compared togither, whither should in all respects be bet∣ter then the other, but so ioyned together, that the one should bee an aide & helpe for the other) might so strengthen the Realme on al sides in their seuerall natures, that not any Nation may become dangerous vnto vs▪ nor we disarme ourselues of that weapon wher in God & Nature hath made vs excell, and whereby we haue euer ben preualent ouer al our enemies: For by the Supplie to be made by Archrie amongst the greatest nomber of persons (which if any present need shuld require, could not be furnished with other war∣like munition, both for want of abilitie, & also by reason it can not wel be had for so many as ther be able men to serue with the same) it wil fal out, that noe fit persons will be founde naked or vnprofi∣table be the accidentes of Warre neuer so suddaine: Of the want wherof, we haue heard men of good Iudgement latelie complaine, in respect of the late petie incursion made by the Enemie vpon the Sea-coast in the Countie of CORNWAL: Wherfore, it may please your Honours and Wisdomes to accept of our good intents (though we be of the meanest sort of her Highnesse Subiects) who do not so much herein pretend our owne prefermentes or aduaun∣tages, as the aduauncement of the Honour of this Realme, whiche hath shoane bright in your noble Auncestors, by their manifould Conquestes, famouslie atchieued, especiallie, by vertue of this Weapon: And we shall (deuotely) praie to God, that that Fame and Honour may redouble vpon your selues & yours, in this time of her Maiesties most happie raigne, and so successiuelie, for euer.
