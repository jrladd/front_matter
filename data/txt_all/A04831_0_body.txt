MAny are those Rela∣tions that Christ the Prince of Peace stands in towards beleevers, He a Father, they his chil∣dren, he a Sheapheard, they

his sheepe, he an head, they his members, he a King, they his Subjects, he a Lord, they his Servants, he a generall, they his Souldiers, he an hus∣band, they his spouse; and a∣mongst all these relations, not one enricheth the beleeving heart with more heavenly consolation than this, of being a husband to his Church, for by this the beleever becomes assured of all things his heart can desire, of Communion with Christ, of protection, preservation, maintenance, spirituall and temporall, yea of heaven it selfe Christs

spouses joynture: of this most comfortable subject I have published this small treatise, and the cause inforcing mee to the publication thereof, was the earnest request of some speciall and neere friends, whose affections were much moved with the Subject handled in the Pul∣pit: to satisfie their desire (being no lesse to me than a command) and for the com∣fort and Edification of Gods Church, I have endeavoured to publish the notes somewhat more fully handled than in the Pulpit, hoping that none

will despise Timothie for his Youth, considering that out of the mouth of Babes the praise of God is perfected. Although I want not some private respects to inforce me to dedicate this my labour unto your Worships, as that I may give some open testifi∣cation of my gratefull minde to you both, for those perso∣nall favoure received, yet the chiefest reason was be∣cause this Treatise seemes to be due to you both, who are joyned together not onely in the common bonds of Matri∣mony, but as Aquila and

Priscylla, Zacharie and Elizabeth married together in the Lord and to the Lord Jesus, as to one Husband: this relation to Jesus Christ appeares by that high respect you shew to the spokesmen and faithfull ministers of Je∣sus Christ, by your Pietie and Zeale for the honour of the Lord Iesus. Let Caesar and Pompey contend for superi∣ority in fading and vani∣shing greatnesse. Let your Worships contend with an holy ambition for the obtai∣ning and retaining of Gods favour, and an humble ac∣quaintance

and communion with his heavenly highnesse, by keeping Faith and a pure Conscience.
Let the men of this world, whose sole portion is in this life, glory that they are crow∣ned with a concurrance of present felicities. Let your Worships glory be, that toge∣ther with a confluence of worldly contentments, the God of heaven hath crowned you with his Mercy and Grace in Christ, and esteeme it your chiefest Honour that God hath made you Honou∣rable with the Bereans for

your love to the truth; with Iabez for your Piety and Devotion, and that he hath made you Noble with Theo∣philus for your love to God, his People, his Lawes, his Cause, which love of truth, piety, and devotion; love to God and his cause, shall give a luster to all your other greatnesse, and shall be able in the day of tryall and ac∣count, to make you stand like an unmoveable Rocke with triumphing confidence before the terrour of the last day, when all other worldly great∣nes without the former shall

shrinke in the wetting, and shall wish it selfe so little it could not be seene; in that shall call to the Mountaines to fall upon it and to cover it. The great God of hea∣ven and earth, replenish your Noble hearts with a dayly increase of heavenly hords of Grace, and trea∣sures of Comforts in the pra∣ctise of Holinesse, and per∣severance in well doing, which may give you an earnest of those inexhau∣stable treasures of joy and happinesse, reserved in the highest heavens for

all that love the Lord Je∣sus in sincerity, this shall be the dayly prayer of him who humbly desires to bee accounted
