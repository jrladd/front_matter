DId not the beginning of the worke it selfe sufficiently pleade an excuse for euery part of the Worke; I should (Gentle Reeder) trouble thee with a tedious tale of the man∣ner, matter, and cause of this Building; and therein begge that chaitable Almes, which the hone∣stie of thine owne Nature will giue me without any trou∣blesome acclamation: Let it suffice, I haue written no more then I haue seene, nor added a benefit which I haue not knowne liberally bestowed vpon the industrious; of which, if you will be a pertaker, follow their Imitation, and to good labours adde a good life, and there is no feare of a Blessing: if any man be costiue or hard of beliefe. I know not how to purge him, except it be with the bitter ayres of those barren places where these Ster∣rill Grounds are; on which, if he liue and haue no foode but his owne labour, doubtlesse he will not only beleee, but loue and admire what is written for a generall profit; and to that I leaue those: The rest that are of more equall indifferencie, to the Blessings and Increase which shall come by worthy knowledge and experience. Fare∣well.
