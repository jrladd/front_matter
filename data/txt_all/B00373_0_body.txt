MVCH REVERENCED,
AND truly Honoured Sir, To whom so much hath beene giuen (as by You to Me) of him both piety and honesty require that something should be re∣turned (from Me to You.)
I neuer looke on the Riuers which empt themselues into the Seas from whence they came; nor on the Birds which whistle and sing to the glory of their Maker; nor on the Beasts that yeeld themselues to be our food for their Fodder; but I thinke what I should be vnto You. You that clothed Mee when I was naked; You that fed Mee when I was Hungry; You that entertained Mee when I was a Meere Stranger to you; You that since that, both countenanced and Comforted Mee when I was Cast out as an Out-Cast, and Off-scouring; To You I owe My Selfe and Seruice in such a manner and measure as that I wish (as a great part of my happinesse) it were in Mee or Mine to doe You any
seruice that might be worth your acceptance.
