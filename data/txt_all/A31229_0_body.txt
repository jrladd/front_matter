Gracious Sovereign,
I Sent Your Maje∣sty
this Account at
my Return from
Candie, emboldened by
the Orders You were
pleased to give me (when

I left England) to ac∣quiant
You with all I
found New abroad;
and this I could by no
means call Old, seeing
to me the Cause and
Progress of the War
was altogether unknown.
From You (Great Sir)
it had a gracious Acce∣ptance,
and from You
again it begs Reception,
since by Your Commands
it is now made Pub∣lique:

Nor will Your
People be unwilling to
hear how miraculously
Christendom is De∣fended
against the Com∣mon
Enemy of our
Faith and Peace.
This is that Man of
Sin that exalteth him∣self
against all that is
called God; and that
great Leviathan, whose
Teeth are thought so
terrible; yet in his

Nostrils there is fix'd
a Hook: For certainly
never did Providence
more plainly appear,
then in giving Bounds
to this Monster at
Sea, where had he been
but ordinarily Victori∣ous,
with terrour he had
appeared at their Doors,
to whom now his Name
is hardly known.
'Tis in the Deep he
has seen Gods Won∣ders,

and where he ne∣ver
had the least Suc∣cess,
though that be the
Grand Argument of
his Belief and Do∣ctrine.
That Memorable
Battel of Lepanto
made him then know,
That our Vnited Force
could stop his Fury;
But now the Victories at
Fogies, Nixia, and
the Dardanels, have

apparently proclaim'd
his weakness, and that
the Venetians them∣selves
are more then
Match for him.
'Tis past my reach
(Sacred Sir) to find in
Humane Reason how
Men so approvedly
Stout as these Infidels
are, and not unacquain∣ted
with Maritime
Affairs, should always
so degenerate at Sea, as

to seem contemptible to
half their Number,
who have no extraordi∣nary
Traffique to make
them more Experienc'd
then themselves: Nay,
which is yet more won∣derful,
Why should the
Apostates that command
these Ships (who were,
whilst Christians, admi∣red
for their Valour and
Conduct) turn presently
inconsiderable, as if

with their Faith they be∣came
Bankrupts of their
Natural Talents too!
The Pyrats of Tri∣poli,
Tunis, and Al∣giers,
do far excell
all other Turks in Ves∣sels;
nor put they one
scarce out whose Officers
are not Renegades, of
eminence in their respe∣ctive
Professions, and
drawn thither by the
great assurance of Gain

and Profit. Yet about
Ten Years since, Sixteen
of the best of these
(sent as Auxiliaries
to Constantinople)
were ruined by Lazaro
Mocinigo (that thrice
worthy General) with
the Armata Sottile, his
Fleet at Oars only:
when as one Ship of
the Republiques has in
a dead Calm destroy'd
as many of the Ene∣mies

Gallies, as he had
then to oppose these Ro∣vers.
Nothing (Mighty
Prince) but this Chri∣stian
State could ever
Parallel You, who
have a Puissant Foe
now on Your Hands,
and yet no noise of
Drums within Your
Streets: Your Enemy
must be acknowledg'd
also much to resemble

theirs, in commencing a
War when 'twas least
expected, and presently
forc'd to seek means of
avoiding Fighting and
Encounters.
May You then Both
be for ever Victorious,
as hitherto in all En∣gagements
You have
been; For as Reli∣gion
compels me to wish
the one, so the Laws of
God and Man obliges

me to the other, as bear∣ing
the indelible Chara∣cter
of

London,
May 23.
1666.
