My Lord,
I Humbly beg leave to present to your Lordships hands, a very plain Discourse, but very necessary in such an

Age as this, wherein the principles of Rebellion are openly profest and taught, and the Doctrine of Non∣resistance and Passive Obedience, not confuted, but laught out of countenance.
There▪ have been indeed a great many excellent Books writ upon this Argument by learned men; but I fear most of them are too learned for ordinary Readers, who most need instruction, and are most easi∣ly poisoned with Seditious ▪Do∣ctrines; and therefore there is still occasion enough ▪for such a small Treatise as this, which I hope is fitted to the understanding of the meanest men, who will be so honest, as impartially to con∣sider it: and those who will not read nor consider, what is offered for their conviction, are out of the

reach of all instruction, and must be governed by other methods.
My Lord, Your Lordships known Loyalty and Zeal for the service of the Crown, which by the favour of a wise and discerning Prince has deservedly advanced you to so high as Station, made me presume, that such a present as this, though in ▪it self very mean, might not be unacceptable to you, especially when it is intended as a publick ac∣knowledgment (the best which my mean circumstances in the World enable me to make) of those great favours I have received from your Lordship.
That God would bless your Lordship with a long Life, and vigorous Age, and encrease of Ho∣nour,

for the service of the King, and of the Church, is the prayer of,
My Lord,
