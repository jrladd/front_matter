My LORD,
SO many Books have al∣ready been dedicated to you, and their Authors have so far ingross'd all manner of Thoughts, in endeavouring to give us a perfect Idea of
your Vertues, that I want words to add new Praises to those they have already gi∣ven you. And indeed, my Lord, where should I find proper words to express the Confidence and Esteem which the greatest and wisest of our Kings has repos'd in and demonstrated towards you, in committing the Care of the Dauphin's Education to you? This great Choice, puts your Merit so far above Praise and Envy, that there needs no other Elogy to sa∣tisfy Posterity that you are a Man without Defects.
Therefore, my Lord, I am perswaded that a respectful Silence will prove more elo∣quent, than all what I could say, and that in dedicating my Book to you, I shall offer you nothing that is worthy of you.
If after this sincere Avow∣sal, you will be pleas'd to honour it with your Prote∣ction, it will be free from the Censure of those Criticks who never like any thing; and I will think my self ve∣ry happy, to have found this occasion, to let the World
know, that I am with all the Zeal and all the Respect ima∣ginable,
My LORD,
