Right Honorable,
MY old Master the Lord Chan∣cellor Bacon would often say, That the magnificence of a Parliament, consisted much in the presence of their Prince; and that the reflection of his Royal Affection, was as a foil to ren∣der them as Diamonds of greater value in their Countries service. If those natural flaws of Self-interest, were not frequently known to become a motive to make them forfeit their Trust and subvert their Obe∣dience, which invited that Lords obser∣vation to reflect upon such a Model of new Laws, as no forc'd power should be able to take away the regallity of Sove∣raign Rights, nor their prerogative have
 a Medium to intrench upon the priviledge of their Subjects; and that his Phyloso∣phy should be the sole revenue to support the Magie of so magnificent a Machini, without any other imposition on the people, then its attendance upon Providence; and to change the temper of loose and avariti∣ous minds into Moral and divine virtues: but that Lord being commanded by King James, to write the life of Henry the Seventh, and his great imployments in State affairs, were the divertisements which retarded his inclination to that study, and left only the essay of his Mineral Phi∣losophy to support his Solomons House, de∣scribed in his New Atlantis, as a test whereby the success of his other experi∣ments might be judged. And now most Honored Sir, you having received the Lord Fairfax his Letter to the Parliament, in answer of mine, touching the making good my Articles, as also to recompence my great sufferings, hath made me so pre∣sume
 on your Lordship, as to beseech you to patronize this publication of my proceedings, and the rather for that I per∣ceive by the weekly accurrance. Your Ho∣nor hath sent a Letter of Thanks to the Lord Fairfax, in the Name of the whole House, for his late opportune service done to the Honorable Parliament, which hath emboldned me the more to put your Honor in mind of a result of the said Lords Letter directed to your self, & dated the 29 of July last, least the interpretation of your Honors Letter should be held in the Diary of a Complement, when the L. Fairfax his Let∣ter is laid aside, which concerns his and the Parliaments Honor to make good, and be∣cause his Lordship did me the favor to send me a true Copy of what was writ, I have made bold humbly to present you with the grounds and reasons at large, which in∣duc'd him to it, that the Parliaments wisdom might take a more present care of the whole matter, rather then the glory of such a
 work should perish for want of a right un∣derstanding. And if it may seem to any Per∣son of that Honorable House, too great a favor for me to have my Articles made good, I shall humbly pray no more, then that their Justice may protect my Mineral adventures at Rowpits upon the Forrest of Mendip, and other deserted places, and to defend my Feoffees in trust, who have resol∣ved to make a true trial of my Lords Phy∣losophy in that affair, since most Men re∣puted me not well in my wits, for attempt∣ing the seeming impossibility of recovering their drowned conditions, otherwise those publick spirits will doubtless inevitably suffer. From whence God lead your Lordship by the hand, and all others that will take the pains to read the ensuing Trea∣tise, for then my Genius invites me to be∣lieve, I shall have their unanimous consent so an errevocable Act like the Meeds and Persians, which is and shall be the Prayer
