THE unworthy Author most Humbly presents the en∣suing Treatise, as the 13 Head-Quakers did of late most boldly dedicate their's, Subscrib'd by them on the behalf of the rest of their Friends (they are their own words) with an earnest supplicate to be freed from the imposition of all Oaths, which for pure conscience
sake (as they say) they cannot take at all, concealing (what is their main drift) their desire to obtain a free use for the future of their pri∣vate Meetings, or Conventicles, the Seed-plots of faction, and seditious practises, as St. Augustine proves at large in divers Epistles to the then Raigning Emperours, against the Donatists (the Quakers Pro∣genitors) commending to them by way of advice this moderate State∣maxime, Doctrina præcedat, Disci∣plina sequatur.
With respect to the former part of it I have (as many of my Bre∣thren in the Ministry have learned∣ly done before me) imployed my weak endeavours for the satisfacti∣on of their scrupulous Consciences, referring the execution of the latter
part of it, for severeCorrigi eos cupimus non necari, nee Disciplinam circa eos neg∣ligi. Aug. Ep. 127. Discipline, to your Honours great Authority, and most Sage Counsels; for a blessing on which, to the advance∣ment of Gods glory, the good of the Church, the safety, honour and well∣fare of our Soveraign and his King∣doms, with the publick you have the daily private Prayers and Sup∣plications of him who conceales his Name, not out of a guilty Fear, but a cautious Prudence, not willing to have it aspers'd with reproaches and unjust calumnies, with bitter railings and Invectives, against which there is no fence from the most unspotted Innocence, and wherewith they usually bespatter those who dissent from them in their vain, false, and Antiscriptural opinions, which they cannot main∣tain either by Gods holy Word,
or any rational Arguments, as I shall (God assisting me) Prove, and Illustrate in the following Treatise, presented in all Humility to your Honours for its Patronage, not doubting of your gracious par∣don for the boldness of my Dedi∣cation.
