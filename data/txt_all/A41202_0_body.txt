HONOURED SIR,
SO soon as I resolv∣ed
upon the Pub∣lication
of the fol∣lowing
Papers, I
fixed on You as
the only Person to whom they
should be Addrest: And indeed,
whether I look on the Author,
or on my Self, I conceive I was
many wayes Obliged so to do.
For as to the Author: You
are a Worthy Branch of the

Noble and Ancient FAMILY
of EGLINTOUN, whereof
God had given Him the peculiar
Charge and Oversight in the Or∣dinary
Course of his Ministry: A
Family which (as Himself some∣where
testifies) were his great
Encouragers in going about all
the parts of his Function, with
Joy and not with Grief; and
for which he had sent up many
Fervent Prayers to the Throne
of Grace, of the Effects whereof
You your Self me (Blessed be
God) yet a living Instance. It
was to that Noble Patriot and
Zealous Instrument of Our late
Reformation, Your Grand-Father,

and to the Noble Earl
Your Father (then Lord Mont∣gomery)
and to Your most Ex∣amplarly
Pious and Religious
Mother, That the Author did
Dedicate his Exposition of the
Epistles to the Galatians and E∣phesians;
And as all who have the
Honour to know You, are glad to
see You so Naturally trace the
Religious Example of Your
Honourable Predecessors, in
Your firm Adhering to Your
Principles, and Purity of Re∣ligion,
Your Encouraging of
Piety and Persons Pious, Your
Streight, Sincere and Vpright
Deportment towards All (a

Quality as Eminent in that Noble
Earl Your Grandfather, as rare
in this Generation) so I nothing
doubt, but that if it had pleased
God to have spared the Author,
to Publish any other of his
Works, He would have looked
upon Your self, as the most Proper
person, to whom he should Present
them.
As for my self: Your Respect
to the Author's Memory with
your undeserved kindness to all
his Relations, and to my Self in
particular, Do strongly oblige me
to take all Occasions for testify∣ing
my Thankful Acknowledge∣ments.
And I presume I can scarce

give You a more Acceptable Te∣stimony
of my Gratitude, than
the presenting You with the en∣suing
Papers, which tho the Pub∣lication
be posthumous, yet I hope
a serious perusal of them, will be
sufficient to supersede any further
Commendation: And indeed
my near Relation to the Author,
will not allow me to speak either
of Him or his Works, what per∣haps
others might: And therefore
without giving You any further
trouble, but Commending You
and Your Vertuous Lady to the
Protection of the Almighty; And
Wishing, That as God has blessed
You with an Hopeful off-spring,

who are as so many Living Images
of your selves, in whom you see
your own Lives renewed, & who
by Their Good Enclinations,
do already give us cause to expect
the best of Them; So You and
They may live together till You
see Them prove a Comfort unto
You; And that after You are gone,
They may be no less Vseful in
Their Generation, than now You
are; I shall humbly crave leave to
subscribe my self in all duty,
