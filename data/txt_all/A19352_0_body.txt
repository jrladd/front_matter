RIght Noble Ladyes.
Although I know that worthy Knight, the Author of thèse Es∣sayes, hateth nothing more then comming in publick, yet many Copies of them being bestowed, by often transcription (as it many times hapneth) they might haue

beene by a mercenary hand fowly corrupted and altered in sence, and both in his absence and mine, deliuered to some Printer, who to make present gaine, would haue published them vnpolished, and de∣formed without any correction: to preuent which, hauing in my hands a perfect Copy, and being inward∣ly priuate with his priuatest con∣ceits, I thought it better to divulge them, then to aduenture that ha∣zard. To couer this presumption, I haue made your Ladiships part∣ners in the patronage, because I am sure howsoeuer he shall dislike the publishing, yet it shall please him that your Ladiships names are ho∣noured in the forefront of his wri∣tings. I know also, that if himselfe could haue been perswaded to make

The worke of it selfe being ver∣tuous, it cannot but be gracious to your Ladiships: for in this back∣ward Age (too much declining from Vertue,) who are more fit to protect and defend her then your Ladi∣ships, who are so neerely allied to Vertue, that she hath chosen you for her Temple, therein inshrined her selfe, and in you onely desireth to be adored. Your Ladiships are

If then your Ladiships shall pa∣tronize these Essayes, what vene∣mous tongues shall dare to infect them? If you like, who will dislike them? what you allowe, nothing but Enuie, Detraction, and Igno∣rance wil disallow, whose infectious

reaths shall bee so purified by the recious Balme of your Vertues, that all shall sodainlie dissolue into the sweet Aire of Applause. They are now (Honorable Ladies) your owne, being freelie giuen to your Ladiships by the true hearted Af∣fection of their Author, and by the hands of
