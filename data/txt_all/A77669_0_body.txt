RIght Honoura∣ble, the great glory of your name, and un∣paralleled goodnesse of your nature, have not invited,
 but inforced the readiest affections of my mind, like so many winged messen∣gers, to flye to your most honoured Lordship, in most humble acknowledgement of that unspeakable duty and service I owe to your most noble linage, which if I should forget, I were wor∣thy, as Alexander once served one, o bee branded in the forehead with Ingra∣tus Hospes. My Father had this small Parsonage he now enjoyes through the meanes of the Right Hono∣rable your Lordships grand father of famous memory, whose deserts were so great that Vertue and Fortune scemed to contend for the
 preheminence in crowning them: had he no statue e∣rected for him, his great memory is marble to it self, and his goodnesse is its owne Monument sufficient to consecrate his name to perpetuity. Hee is gone, Majore nostro cum da∣mno quàm suo, (as Sue∣tonius said of Titus) his soule accompanyed with the winged hoast of heaven is fled to her Maker, and is clothed with the glorious robes of immortality and perfect glory in heaven; where I leave his blessed soule, and returne to your Lordship, who makes mee weigh my thoughts as it were in a ballance, whether
 I should conceive mre griefe for the death of your Lorships grandfather, or more joy for enjoying your Lordship, who now shines in the upper Region of ho∣nour and authority: cer∣tainly 'tis fit they should be equall. Seeing then my joy is nothing diminished, I am bold humbly to crave your Lordship propitious favor so much as to shroud this my brood (now offered with the young Eagles at the altar of your Sunne) under your Honours power∣full wings; that like the Sparrow which fled into the Philosopher Zenocra∣tes his bosome from the ta∣lons of the perspicacious
 Hawke, it may be protected from the poysonous teeth of black-mouth'd Momus, in this criticall, carping and censorious age. As Apel∣les when he painted Buce∣phalus, appealed to none but Zeuxis: so I appeale from the judgement of all men to your Lordships ap∣probation, without which this meane worke of mine may be compared, as Pla∣to compared many writing Adonidis hortis, writings that were of short continu∣ance, Scombros metuen∣tia scripta. Your most no∣ble name, honoured of all sorts of men, being stamped in this leaden peece of my phantasie, will make it cur∣rant:
 and as Phidias his Images were wont to be r∣spected for the makers sake not for the stuffe: so your Honour will make this I∣mage, and gain rspect un∣to it; for unlesse your Lord∣ship were ultim perfe∣ctio & forma hujus ma∣teriae, I might well say with Theognis,
,
Agens verò non egi, & non finivi finiens.
I should never have pre∣sumed to crave your Ho∣nourable patronage of these first fruits of my poore en∣deavours, or but offered them to your judicious view; but that I trust you
 will favourably accept the will for the deed, because Voluntas est mensura a∣ctionum. It is enough for little Birds to be , it is required of beasts that are bigger Characters in the booke of Nature, to bee : For obscure and poore men that were not able to sacrifice a living Bull, the Gentiles deemed it sufficient if they did but Taurum efarina fingere. Artaxerxes did gratiously accept of a fist-full of water from the hand of poor Cy∣naetas. And ambitious Alexander the Great, would parva libenter ac∣cipere.

I hope therfore (most No∣ble Lord) that as the great glory of your powerfull name is able to dispell the foggy mists of my weak∣nesse, so your goodnesse which exceeds your great∣nesse will excuse my bold∣nesse: So shall I rejoyce more then the old Arcadi∣ans did to see nights sable canop removed, and hea∣vens great spye, the Sunne, shine in his sphere againe; and I will alwayes praise the Lord of Lords for your earhly honour, praying for increase thereof, be∣seeching him to multiply his richest blessings upon yur Honour here, and to give you the inco∣ruptible
 Crowne of glory hereafter.
