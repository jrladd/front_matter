Right Honourable,
THese Collections which I herewith send, having passed the censure of some learned Friends with good appro∣bation, I presume to commend to your Honours perusall and finall disposing: If I be out in any thing I shall ac∣cept it as a great favour if your Honour wil stoop to ad∣vertise me of it. The notes upon the Observations I have not yet fairly copied out, being a weak scribe, in regard of my continuing infirmi∣ties: otherwise I had adventured them with these, (as I had a good while since designed them) to your Honours hands: glad would my heart have been (as I presume many more) if the pen or tongue might rather have arbitrated these differences then the sword, which puts no difference between good and evill; The good God look downe in mercy upon the Land, and put an happy end to these miseries which otherwise are like to put a miserable end to all our happinesse. This is the constant prayer of▪
Late at night and in haste
