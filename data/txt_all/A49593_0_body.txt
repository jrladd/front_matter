I Have made bold to dedi∣cate this little piece to your Ladyship to give the World a publick Testi∣mony how great an ho∣nour I receive from the

friendship you are pleas'd to make me blest with.
I never had any reason to accuse my self of guilt from any haughty vanity before I became known to you, I was till then so inconside∣rable, I thought there was nothing capable to give me the least Elevation: But, Madam, I have felt since the force of your Charms, wherever you bestow so high a favour there's no re∣sisting the fate of that pride which unavoidably,

attends it, and I can't but glory now in my exalted∣ness which springs from your bounty, which other∣wise would render me a no mean Criminal.
One may have good thoughts of ones self for be∣ing a Religious Votary to Heaven; and Madam, I know not wherein the fault lies, if I ingenuously con∣fess, I have at present no indifferent ones as to my own regard, in being with so much Devotion yours,

especially when that awful respect I bear you, is re∣ceived with so great an ac∣knowledgment of kind∣ness from you.
You'll find the ensuing History full of various and perplexed Accidents from which your distress'd Asteria is at last happily delivered through the con∣stancy of her Love to the as faithful and generous Adanaxus. And, Ma∣dam, let me humbly in∣treat you, what ever Risque

I may run of displeasing you by this hardy adven∣ture, to give me your par∣don for the rash address I have made to you; since it was beyond my power to overcome the Ambition I had to signalize my self by the quality of,
Honoured Madam,
