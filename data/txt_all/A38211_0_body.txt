MADAME,
THis smal Volume humbly Offered to your Hand con∣tains part of the Life and Reigne of one of the Greatest
Monarchs in the World: The rest, 'tis hoped, as it will be the imployment of a more elegant Pen, so it will not be accomplisht till it afford a Chronicle of more years Prosperities in these Nations
then this is of Miseries. That I have presumed to dedicate it to your Ladiship, if I in∣curre the censure of boldness, I am confident every one will commend the fitnesse of my Choice: Since no∣thing
could be more proper then to in∣title your Ladiship to the Relation of that Life, which, next under the Di∣vine Providence, you were chiefly in∣strumental to pre∣serve. To you, Ma∣dame, we owe all
that can be ow'd from Christians, Subjects, or Men, to any person upon Earth; by whose dangerous but ever memorable Fideli∣ty we are at length restor'd to what∣ever is dear to us in those three capaci∣ties;
and which is no small considera∣tion, to the liberty of publishing the impartiall truths (as far as the best Relations afford∣ed) in this Book. Nor is the present Age onely oblig'd to you, but your glo∣ry
shall live upon Record, and your Name, (embalmea with praises) be preserved in the memory of thank∣full Posterity. In all which respects, I have thought it my duty both in te∣stimony of my par∣ticular
Loyalty & Gratitude to pre∣sent this Piece to your Ladiship as the Person that ha's the greatest right to it, & with∣all publickly to ac∣knowledge my self,
MADAME,
