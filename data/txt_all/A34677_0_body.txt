May it please Your Highness,
AS nothing can be presented to the Poten∣tates of the World of greater value, then the Labours of Famous Historio∣graphers, who describe to the life the Examples of such Eminent Personages as were transcendent in preceding Ages; and may in their

Successours beget both Emulation and Experi∣ence: so shall I not need to apprehend that this History (which in all humility I present unto Your Highness) will prove unacceptable, since therein You may encounter with such a Model of all kinde of Vertues and Perfections, as I hope may take a deeper impression in Your Highnesses Breast, in regard that it will be found, that Art herein is seconded by Nature. And whereas I am under the lash of a severe Castigation for my presumption, in profering this History to Your Review, as I acknowledge, when I seriously consi∣der how You have attracted to Your Self that lively Pourtraiture of his Great Soul, that You appear the true Embleme both of his Vertues and Majesty.
May it please Your most Serene Highness, I cannot chuse but address this present Oblation as to Your Self, so in other Languages, to the rest of the Princes and Potentates of the Earth, I bequeath it unto posterity, very humbly craving the favourable Protection of Your Highnesses Pa∣tronage. Nor durst I publish so glorious a Work to the World, before I had craved Your Highnesses pardon for my Rashness, in adventuring to trace those Vigorous Lineaments in the Alexander, whom Your Highness so well resembleth, and in whom your Highness beareth so great a part. Moreover, as a sole Apelles could onely be ca∣pable of so great an Enterprize, so it will be alto∣gether unnecessary for me to endeavour the De∣scription of that Pourtraiture, which so evi∣dently

is manifested to all the World, both in Your Highnesses Person and Actions: Wherefore, my Lord, I must needs confess, that Your Highness is the true Original, and mine onely relating to the Out-side of so Great and unalterable an Albionist. The truth is, I finde not in my self ability to ex∣press the Real Worth of His Accomplishments, and Hardy Features, accompanied with that Vi∣vacity and Lustre, which secret Mystery lyeth onely in the Hand of that great Master of Nature, and Extant in that very Personage, whose Si∣mile is hardly this Day to be found in the whole Ʋniverse, except in Your Inimitable Self. Nor doth Art or Humane frailty allow so much to be in the Possession of the best men. Therefore those who go about to Pourtraict such like Incomparable Personages, cannot avoid one of those extremities, which Painters run into when they go about to represent the Sun; who either place themselves at so great a distance, as that they can onely discover an ineffications and feeble Reflections of its Beams; or approach so neer unto it, as that being dazled with its Resplendency, and overcome with its Heat, they are bereaved of their Senses, and retain onely their Hearts at liberty to adore and admire that powerful Hand, which formed so glorious a Creature. To the like Non plus am I reduced, who rashly ascend to the very summit of the Throne of Honour, thence to contemplate his late Highness Person, surrounded by so glo∣rious a Resplendency as no eyes are able to behold, nor to be comprehended by the mindes of men; so

that I must needs sink under the burthen, and content my self with the Poets Expression,
—Inopem me copia fecit.
In which extasie all my Senses being surprized, my Heart is onely left free to admire, and my Tongue to plead Excuses, and offer up good Wishes, which I most humbly Dedicate and Devote unto Your most Serene Highness. Nor could the Heavens have ever established a more fitting Per∣sonage, to bear a share in, or inclination unto this Work, then Your Highness, as well as to defend it from Envy it self. And if so be History be a second Life, Your Highness may judge by the black Attempts which threatned Your Glorious Father, how this Work will be assailed; and how many Enemies its Authour must resolve to en∣ter into the Lists withall: their Rage being thereby renewed and augmented, by their percei∣ving that the Tomb hath onely bereaved us of the least part of this Great Heroe. And how malicious soever their Envy may appear in such Stories which possibly may be written in Contra∣diction hereof; it will onely publish from Truth it self, to the World, their inveterate Spleen, which can never pierce through the bright Rayes of his Innocent and Glorious Actions.
Moreover, whereas the Divine Providence hath so often and miraculously preserved the first life of his late Highness, against the Attempts both of men and monsters; Your most Serene High∣ness is also engaged, as well by Imitation, as by the Interest of Your Care and Royal Dignity,

to watch over the Preservation of his second Life, which is in Your Highness by so Lawful a Succession, as is devolved upon Your Self. The Glorious Course whereof I resolve to trace from this very moment; that I may the better publish the Illustrious Transactions thereof in five other Languages, which during my Travels I have acquired. In which also I intend to publish this present History, the French being already per∣fected and fit for the Press: His great Soul ex∣pecting proportionable Honours to its Dignity; and his vaste Minde requiring number less Ele∣gies, which may remain as so many living Monu∣ments, not to be defaced by Times Violence nor Envy. But I press this Subject too home to Your Highness, since You bear so great a share there∣in, and my self dare attribute so little of it to my own incapacity, of compassing so great an undertaking.
Wherefore, I shall onely hereby endeavour to attract others, and to shew them the Borders and Coast of that vaste Sea into which they ought to lanch: so that like to a Forelorn Hope, I shall onely first mount the Breach, and by di∣verse Languages animate all the Trumpets of Fame, to Celebrate the Glory of his late High∣ness, in those parts of the World, where I have conversed for the space of sixteen or eighteen years past. Hoping for the future to write the Heroick Actions of this Nation in unexpugna∣ble Characters, to leave unto Posterity (as an eye witness) the Rehearsal of those Victories

which Heaven shall bestow on England, under Your Glorious Government; that so I may the better satisfie my Zeal and Fidelity to Your Highness, and approve my self to be
