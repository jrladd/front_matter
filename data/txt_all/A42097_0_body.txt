MY LORD,
YOU were pleased in your Visitation of our Ca∣thedral Church this last Summer, to recom∣mend to my Self and Brethren, the revival of an Ancient Religious Custom of Sermons on Wed∣nesdays and Fridays in Advent and Lent.
With which Pious Motion we have not only readily complied, but laid out our endeavours to prepare the People of this City to concur, that we might be secured of a Congregation, and that this Undertaking might be performed in the best Decorum and most to Edification. Which having proved, God be thanked, very successful, I thought my self obliged in this most publick manner to give the World an Account of it, that other Diocesses, as they need not disdain in other things to follow the Example of Durham, so they might in this be encoura∣ged by our happy success to imitate that Godly Practice, for the Precedent of which they owe very much to your Lordship.
The Magistrates, and People of best Quality in this City, do by their Presence intimate how much they are gratified that their Cathedral should first restore this Re∣ligious Course, which was in use here in the memory of some of our Body, and has been at York ever since the return of the Monarchy, and we have reason to believe has been observed in most if not all Cathedrals, before the Great Rebellion.
And whatsoever measures Cathedrals and Churches in remote parts may now take upon so seasonable and con∣siderable an Instance, there are just grounds of belie∣ving that some great Churches in this Country, where After∣noon and Week-day Lectures have been usual, will change

them by this regular practice, into a course of Advent and Lent, and Festival Sermons. I hear already of one very noted Corporation, which upon the very Fame of ours is about that design, which if others would be per∣swaded to follow, it must be looked on as a considerable Reformation.
For surely, My Lord, if Preachers faithfully and pru∣dently discharge their province, and preach de tempore; such a Course of Sermons will preach up the Church of England as much as some Lectures have preached it down: Nor can there be any better expedient to prevent ill effects of that Liberty, which has been taken by Preachers in the choice of Subjects, and preaching as well as praying, according to their own Fancies and Humors: A thing diametrically opposite to the design of the Church, and which I shall (as in Duty bound) always oppose within the Circuit of my Jurisdiction.
I am not willing to give your Lordship further trou∣ble, but I dare not slip this fair occasion to declare to the World, That I think my self obliged to your Lordship in an extraordinary manner for sundry noble Favours and Acts of great Goodness towards me, especially since my late undeserved Promotion, among which none make such deep Impression on my Soul as your present Concur∣rence and Countenance in the discharge of my Offices, and honest Zeal for the House and Service of God.
Begging the Continuance of your Lordships Kindness (which I shall do all that in me lies to secure) together with your Benediction on my Person and Endeavours, I do subscribe my self with great Sincerity and Respect,
My Lord,
