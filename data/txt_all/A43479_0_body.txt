JLLVSTRIOVS AND NOBLE PRINCE,
AMong the manie Arts professed in the World, the Art Mili∣tary
practised in our moderne Warres of these Vnited Pro∣vinces,
(the Nurcerie of the Milita) ought not to be accounted
the least: for what magnanimous, braue vailliant Generalls,
Chieftaines, Commandours & Souldiers of all nations have
bin bred, and brought vp in this Academia, and Sede belli
is sufficiently knowne to the World, and what honorable
Actions, and memorable services they have done and performed, returning victo∣rious
out of the Feild, I leaue to the testimonie of Historie. Especially, the Almighty
God, the Lord of Hoasts hath so blessed your generous House, as namely, your
grand-father Prince William, your vncle Prince Maurice, both of immortall memorie,
and now your victorious Father, Prince Fredrick Henry our Captaine Generall, as in∣struments
for the defence of his afflicted Church, the true protestant Religion, & for
the maintenance of the Privileges, & freedomes of the Land & hath crowned them
with an never-dying name, against the violence plotts and subtill machinations of one
of the mightiest Potentates of all Christendome. What glorious actions the Al∣mighty
God hath wrought by them, for the deliverance of his Church and people
in this Land the Historigraphers of our times striue as with Trumpets to sound forth
their fame. For if wee cast our eyes backward to times past, & the beginnings of our
Warres, when this State consisted but in a handfull of people, and a few Townes
and were in great distresse, and compare it with the State of the Land as it is now,
we must acknowledg how wonder-fully God hath blessed, and protected these
Countries against all the Tyrannie, and treacherie of the Duke of Alva, the Bishop
Granvelle, and diverse other Spanish Gouvernours, & that he by his out stretched
Arme, hath extenpsed the Limits, & bounds of these United Provinces, even (as it
were) from the Sunne-rysing, to the Sunne setting, and what hath all the Peruvian
Gold, and the Topazan Silver availed them, wee maye therefore truely say with the
Apostle, If God be with vs, who can be against vs.

Againe, if wee consider what God hath done for this Land of later yeares, it is a
wonder in our eyes how remarkeably & with what good successe he hath blessed
the able Conduct, and dessignes of his highnesse your Father: for in the beginning of
his Generallship did he not take in Groll, & Oldenzeel, and that heauen-blessed Surprisall of
Wesel, even when the Ennemy was entred almost into the bowells of this Countrie
& iust at that time, when his highnesse was engaged so deepely at the Seige of the
Bosch, and carryed that invincible towne, against the expectation of all men? The
yeare after Rhyenbergh, and then became master of the strong towne of Mastricht,
& took it before the noses of two great armies, which lay betweene vs and home,
then his and your owne citty of Breda, within seauen weekes & a day, after wee putt
spade into the Earth, and brake ground towards it, whereas Marquis Spinola lay al∣most
a whole yeare before it. And last of all the strong Castle & Howse of Gennep,
which did so much annoy these Countries; These victories and Lawrils I haue briesly
related, to refresh your highnesse memorie withall, & to the ende, that wee may giue
the glorie and praise vnto God for them.
As for my self, J haue seene these things, & haue serued this Land two and fortie
yeares, and learned some experience in these Warres, which made me take penn in
hand, to writ the Principles of the Art Militarie, practised in these Warres, first vnder the
Conduct of your Uncle Prince Maurice of blessed memorie, as now also vnder your
victorious Father for the instruction of such English Gentlemen, & Souldiers, who
are willing to come into the States seruice, & for the informing of their Iudgments
the better, & with a great deale of labour, charg, and paines haue represented this no∣ble
art by the waye of Figure, the word of Commaund and demonstration, & hauing once
showne one of my three parts to his highnesse your Father, it pleased him in your
presence to giue mee encouragement, to turne my English bookes into Netherdutch.
In obedience whereof, I translated my first part for the exercising of a foote Com∣panie,
and a troupe of Horse (and God willing intend to doe the other two parts in
time) & dedicated it to your highnesse, And now the warres of my native Coun∣trie
and Jreland which the Almighty compose, calling for them againe, as I dedica∣ted
my first part vnto your highnesse in Dutch: so now I most humbly beseech your
highnesse, that vnder your gracious acceptance and patronage this second Edition
maye come againe to the view of the World in my maternall tounge, both in these
Countries and in England, and I shallbe bound not onely to pray vnto God for yow
& her highnesse Royall your dearest consort to blesse yow being our future Hopes next
vnder God hereafter, and a sprigg sprung from that noble howse of Nassaw, to giue
you the like successe and victorie over our Ennemies as he hath done to your prede∣cessours:
but also to crowne you, and her highnesse Royall with everlasting felicity
hereafter resting.
