Right Honourable,
THE scope and substance of this following Discourse, is to demon∣strate by clear and unanswerable Arguments, the Illegality of the Incorporation of those who soly ascribe unto themselves the names of Merchants Ad∣venturers, though they Trade but unto two Townes only, and those hard by: and to show further how their Patent trencheth upon the native Rights of the freeborn subject: which Patent hath been often complaind of and cla∣mord against from time to time, as an univer∣sall greevance to Town and Countrey, tend∣ing to the diminution of Trade, and of all sorts of Manufactures at home, and to the dis-repute of the Policy of this Nation a∣broad, the sayd Patent being accounted no lesse amongst all people, then a Monopoly,
a word odious all the world over. This In∣corporation hath bin like an Ʋlcer upon the Body politique of this Kingdome a long time, which hath beene often rub'd and lanc'd, yet it clos'd againe and gatherd more corruption then formerly, and now requires a greater cure then ever.
Therfore in all humblenesse it is prayed, that this Honourable Court and highest Councell of the Kingdom, who have already done so many glorious things for the publike Liberty, Rights and Immunities of the free borne Subject, would be pleased to peruse the ensuing Dis∣course, and poise the weight of the Reasons, Arguments, and proofes therein produced, which are derived from true fountaines, and so to doe therein what in their high wisedome and justice they shall think expedient for the redresse of such a Nationall grievance.
