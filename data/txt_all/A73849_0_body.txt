BY your Fauours, I had some place amongst you, before; but now I am an Aduen∣turer, if not to VIRGI∣NIA, yet for VIRGI∣NIA: for, euery man that Prints, Aduen∣tures. For the Preaching of this Ser∣mon, I was but vnder your Inuitation; my Time was mine owne, and my Medi∣tations mine owne: and I had beene ex∣cusable towards you, if I had turned that Time, and those Meditations, to GODS Seruice, in any other place. But for the Printing of this Sermon, I am not onely vnder your Inuitation, but vnder your
Commandement; for, after it was prea∣ched, it was not mine, but yours: And therefore, if I gaue it at first, I doe but restore it now. The first, was an act of Loue; this, of Iustice: both which Vertues, Almightie God euer∣more promoue, and exalt in all your proceedings. AMEN.
