SIRS,
THE subject of this smal Treatise may justly intitle its self to your Patronage; for seeing some Circumstan∣ces, relating to renowned London fill up the ensuing Sheets, the Dedication thereby becomes no less an

act of Justice, then Ci∣vility. Ʋnder whose pro∣tection indeed ought any thing, respecting the Ho∣nor of this Metropolis see the Light, but under yours!
But besides the Con∣sideration of your interest, the knowne Candor, and Ingenuity, the worth, and Endowments of your now Lord Mayor, of his im∣mediate, and others his Pre∣decessors, since his Ma∣jesties Restauration, doe not only invite, but com∣mand all ingenuous Ad∣dresses,

as must be con∣fessed by every one, who has had the least Taste of their generous, and obli∣ging Conversation.
And though what is here presented, be of no Consi∣derable worth, yet your Acceptance thereof, will inhaunce its value, And so recommend it to the world, as that it will be loath to censure, what you have once deigned to ap∣prove, not to be too trou∣blesome, My Aim in the Publication, is the benefit of you, the pre∣sent

Inhabitants; And my Ambition in the Dedica∣tion, is to give the world a Testimony, that I am,
SIRS,
 Whitehal
15. Nov. 1675.
