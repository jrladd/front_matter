Right Honourable:
THe fauor that these Meditations found with the more iudi∣cious and deuout sort of people, whē they where first im∣printed, hath caused mee to take more paines and care about this, then I did about the former. What I haue swept out that was in that, what I haue newly added vnto this
 I haue prefaced to the Reader. I haue enough for all my paines, if the Prayers which I haue added will serue at any time to stirre vp the least fire or sparke of deuotion in any Christian heart: but for the Meditations I can neuer speake e∣nough: so heauenly, so pithy, so feeling, and so quicke, that he that reades or heares them, if he haue any life of grace in him, shall feele them not only pleasing to his taste and sweet vnto his eare, but mo∣uing his affections also, and work¦ing on his heart.
Now, that this booke is named vnto your Honour from the man that you haue not known, may be an imputation of my great pre∣sumption, that haue dared to offer it, will bee an intimation of your greater goodnes vouchsafing to accept it: This may your Honour pardon in mee, that shal I praise in
 you; and yet there are some reasons that haue inclined me hereūto. For besides the aduice of my friends herein, that are people of your knowledge, two things as iust mo∣tiues, haue induced me thus to do.
First, hauing liued some yeeres in the place neere, where your Honor kept your residence; and hearing diuers well-affected people testifie of your loue to religiō, your pious heart, and godly conuersation, I thought good in this liuing and liues like Booke, to giue a testimo∣ny thereof also to the men of this age, and to the people that shall come hereafter.
Secondly, because I could not chuse but do, as I thinke all other did, that either knew your person, or had heard of your Honourable name; and knowne your sorrow, namely, condole you in your losse I thought the comforts of this
 Booke would befit your mour∣ning, which speakes oppositely to that purpose, as in other places, viz the exercise of the first and seuenth dayes, so especially in the two and thirtieth Meditation: you will thinke when you reade it, that it was meant and written purposely for your comfort.
I speak out of experience of mine owne affliction, when the Lord of late had made many sorrowes to lay hold of mee at once, and brought vpon mee breaking vpon breaking, like the waues of the Sea, one in the necke of another: after hee had plucktout of my bosome, and slaine theWho died the 19 of August 1614. Mother of my children, mine honest and best-deseruing Wife: after he had bound me to the peace, on the Bed of my sicknesse, hopelesse of life and health, and had like yet farther to haue made a further slaughter in my
 house, amongst my yong ones: In the recouery of my health, when I came to visit my solitary dwel∣ling, these Meditations were mine especiall comforts in the house of my mourning.
God Almighty make this Booke this way also vsefull vnto your Ho∣nour, and otherwise profitable vn∣to your soule, and to the soules of all that reade it; and the Lord giue vnto you a blessing in the increase of grace and honor in this life, and the full fruition of happines in the life to come.
