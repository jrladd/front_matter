Sir,
THat the Paronage of trifles, in this kinde,
hath long since rendred Dedications, and
Inscriptions obsolete, and out of fashion,
I perfectly understand, and cannot but
ingenuously confesse, that I walking in the
same path, may be truly argued by you of
weaknesse, or wilfull errour: but the reasons and defences,
for the tender of my service this way to you, are so just, that
I cannot (in my thankefulnesse for so many favours received)
but be ambitious to publish them. Your noble Father, Sir
Warham Sentliger (whose remarkeable vertues must be
ever remembred) being, while hee lived, a master, for his
pleasure, in Poetry, feared not to hold converse with divers,
whose necessitous fortunes made it their profession, among
which, by the clemency of his judgement, I was not in the lat
place admitted. You (the Heire of his honour anestae in∣herited
his good inclinations to men of my poore quality, of

which I cannot give any ampler testimony tha y ee
and glad profession of it to the world. Besides, (and 
not the least encouragement to mee) many of eminence and
the best of such, who disdained not to take notice of mee,
have not thought themselves disparaged, I dare not say
honoured, to be celebrated the Patrons of my humble stu∣dies.
In the first file of which, I am confident, you shall
have no cause to blush, to finde your Name written. I pre∣sent
you with this old Tragedie, without Prolog, or
Epilogue, it being composed in a time (and that too, per∣adventure,
as knowing as this) when such by ornaments,
were not advanced above the fabricque of the whole worke.
Accept it I beseech you, as it is, and cotinue you fa∣vour
to the Author.
