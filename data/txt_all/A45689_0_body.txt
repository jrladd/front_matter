Honoured Sir,
I Account this Discourse, as holding no proportion with the Greatness of the Occasion which brought it forth, nor with the rest of that Evening-Service, on which it was brought forth (there-being nothing mean in that Funeral but the Sermon) so also unmeet to make one amongst so many already extant upon this subject: And the truth is, unless the Law of the Spirit of life, which is in Christ Ie∣sus set in with it, to free us from the power of sin, and to prepare us for death, This wil  prove to some a pre∣sent, an Object to provoke their contempt, and hereafter a Witness to aggravate their impenitency. However, I resist not its going forth, so our Lord may in any sort serve himself therewith; Any of his find any sweetness or helpfulness in it: My great observance towards your

self, be attested by it, and the lustre of her Name and Memory not darkened from it: Who really was, and uni∣versally was known to be, one of the chiefest Ornaments of her Sex, in this Nation.
Sir, You have it now not onely under my hand, but before many Witnesses, that I am
SIR

Dunstans in the East, this 16th of 12th. Mo. 1654.
