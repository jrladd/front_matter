MOST Reuerend Fa∣ther in God, my especi∣all good Lord. Albeit there is no end in Ecclesi. 12. 12. writing many books, and much reading is a wearinesse to the flesh (as the wise man speaketh:) yet doth the condition of this present age require a multitude of bookes: neither ought we to be weary, so long as the la∣bour onely is ours, the cause Gods, and

not our owne. Our Aduersaries are ne∣uer weary of withstanding the truth, they neuer cease to prouoke vs by bookes, our names are daily traduced in their papers, that vnlesse the Spirit of God waxe cold, and the zeale of his house be quenched in vs, we cannot be silent. And as your Grace hath laboured these fourty yeares without intermission, like a silfull Maister-builder of Gods house, a painefull husbandman in the Ʋineyard, a vigilant Pastour ouer the flocke, and were neuer yet weary of wel∣doing: so my trust is this small volume shall not seeme tedious, which heere I offer vnto your reading, and humbly present vnto your Grace. Since your Grace hath bene called to the office of a Bishop, (as with S, Paule, it is a wor∣thy 1. Tim. 3. 1. worke) so it hath bene with you,

all your time hitherto, a worke rather then a promotion, neither haue you fain∣ted vnder so great a burthen. My pray∣er is for you, that God wich hath begun this good worke in you, will also per∣forme it vntill the day of Jesus Christ. That as you haue deserued that good re∣port which the godly Emperour Theo∣dosius . Sixtus Se∣nensis, Bib∣lioth. sanctae lib. 4. in the Church of Constanti∣nople gaue of S. Ambrose then Bi∣shop of Milanie: so you may contiuue still another Saint Ambrose in our Church, to the glory and honour of God, to whose goodnesse and mercy I com∣mend your Grace, and your godly la∣bours.
