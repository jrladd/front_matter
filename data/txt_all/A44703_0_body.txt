My LORD,
I Sometimes finde an Apologue which the Jewes have in their Talmud, of the Grapes in Babel sending to the Vine-leaves in Judea, to cover them with their shadow. I must make my way to your Lordships hands by this humble Petition, that your Goodness may act the My∣thologist here, and cast your shadow over this imma∣ture and indigested fruit: I know I may justly fall under a severe censure, that such an empty present from so an unknown and worthless hand; should covet so high, as to thrust it self into your Lordships hands: But (my Lord) it is your ennobled Candor which makes me thus presume and presse, which I hope will find cause from it self to accept, what I should from my self finde no confidence to offer, and make the pardon easie, where the error is out of Reverence; and the end not to give any thing to your worth, but to gain something to the work. Abigail her mo∣dest Apology for her slender Present of Figgs and Raisins to David, 1 Sam. 25.27. must be mine to
your Lordship. This slender and worthless piece, as being much below your higher Speculations, Let it be for the young men which walk at your Lord∣ships feet Yet I know not to whom upon better accompt either of Reason or Duty, I should apply my self upon such an occasion, and such a subject, than to your self; whom Providence hath raised to stand as a tall Cedar in our Lebanon: These Conceptions, such as they are, were by command delivered at a Visitation, where your Lordship is present; though not in Person, yet in Power: And thus they yet pursue their main end, in lying at your feet, with this earnest and humble Prayer, that you as a Cedar, and we all as the Firre, Pine, and Box, may make the place of his feet glorious. I conclude with this craving Impress or Motto of him, who setting down only Ciphers in his Roll, wrote this, adde vel unum.
These following pages I have Impress'd as so many Ciphers: if your Lordship will please to adde this one thing, your acceptance and patrociny, they will thence gain both number and weight; and Crown the opportunity, which (as one that is under your Episcopal care and government) I gladly lay hold of, to let your Lordship know, that I am, and do in all humility sub∣scribe my self
My LORD,
