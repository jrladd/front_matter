Right Reuerend,
TO whom should this Sermon preached by a Reuerend man of your Diocesse vpon your iniunction, and countenanced by your Hono∣rable presence and patient at∣tention, haue recourse for pa∣tronage
 but onely to your Lord∣ship; to whom for many re∣spects it doth especially belong. Which hauing gained from the Author by much intreaty, I was (after the reading thereof) so full and pregnant of the birth, that I could beare no longer, but must needs bring forth the same, and lay it in the lap of Gods children. In doing where∣of albeit I had no warrant or allowance from the Author, yet I presume that herein I shall the better satisfie him, because I haue made so good choice of de∣dicating it vnto you. Whom he is bound (as I haue heard him professe) not onely in dutie to
 honour, but in affection to loue for many respectfull fauours & encouragements vouchsafed vnto him in his Ministry. In whose behalfe, as an vnfained well-willer of his, I cannot but be humbly thankfull vnto your Lordship; and in token thereof doe in all dutifull submission, consecrate to your suruey and seruice these his ministeriall la∣bours, this paper-present, and spirituall gift, in steed of some more sightly oblation: hoping that it will be as acceptable vn∣to your Lordship, being now wout alteration truly presented to your eyes, as it was not long since being without affectation
 plainely deliuered vnto your eares. And so vsing no other oliue branch of intercession but the vowed sacrifice of thanke∣full deuotion, submitting the premisses to your fauourable construction, and committing your Lordship to the Almighties gratious protection, I humbly take my leaue; resting euer prest to bee proued, what (though vnknowne) I desire to be accounted,
 London the 18 of September 1616.
