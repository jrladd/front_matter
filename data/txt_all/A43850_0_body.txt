PArdon, Great Sir, this forwardness of mine,
Pardon each rude, and indigested line.
I am no Poet, Sir, nor Poets Son,
Tis seldome, I ere look towards Helicon.
The Eminencies that in them are known,
Except their Povertie I must disown;
And't was my Loyalty, and not my Wit,
As Poet, that hath still occasion'd it.
Here; as it was incumbent every day,
I could not, Flamen like, but Sing and Pray.
Iliads, and Odyss', trouble, and Triumph too,
Of your Great Queen, Great Sir, I offer you.
I thought it my alleageance for to tell
What accidents within our Voyage fell.

 To me 'twas Antidote against the harms
We fear'd, or felt, among the dreadfull Stormes.
Tis now an offering; your Majestick Frown
May mak't a burnt one, then I'm quite undone.
That would astonish and appale me more,
Then all the Horrours of the Sea before.
But 'tis your gratious Candour I doe sue,
Which is both Patronage, and pardon too.
Graunt it, Great Sir, to him, who nere knew how
To merit the least wrinkle, from your brow.
Send from the Chancery of your Royal Brest,
Your Royal pardon, my Quietus est.
