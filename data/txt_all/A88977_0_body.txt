Right Honourable, and Right worshipful,
HE is an Alien, a meer Stanger in England that hath not been acquainted with your generous House-keepings; for my own part, my more particular Tyes of service to you my Honoured Lords, have built me up to the height of this experience, for which this Book now at last dares appear to the world: those times which I attended upon your Honours were those golden dayes of Peace and Hospitality, when you enjoy'd your own, so as to entertain and relieve others.
Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful, I have not onely been an eye witness, but interested by my attendance; so as that I may justly acknow∣ledge those Triumphs and magnificent Trophies of
Cookery that have adorned your Tables; nor can I but confess to the world, except I should be guil∣ty of the highest ingratitude, that the onely stru∣cture of this my Art and Knowledge, I owed to your costs, generous and inimitable expences; thus not onely I have derived my experience, but your Countrey hath reap't the plenty of your Huma∣nity and charitable Bounties.
Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful, Hos∣pitality which was once a Relique of Gentry, and a known Cognizance to all ancient Houses, hath lost her Title through the unhappy and cruel Distur∣bances of these Times, she is now reposing of her lately so alarum'd Head on your Beds of Honour: In the mean space that our English World may know the Maecenas's and Patrons of this Generous Art, I have exposed this Volume to the Publique, under the Tuition of your Names; at whose Feet I prostrate these Endeavours, and shall for ever remain

From Sholeby in Lei∣cestershire, Jan. 24. 1659.
