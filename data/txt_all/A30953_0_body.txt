MADAM, See here, your Roëll Muse
Exults for Ioy your Name to use;
(Fair, Noble, Good, all Titles due,
Are understood, when I name you:)
Well knowing every Thing is grac'd,
That's under your protection plac'd.
She's innocent yet fles t' Your wing,
T'avoid Suspicion. She doth bring
Some Men of Arms, and Other some,
Whose praises do from Learning come.
To Ladies, She hath Honour done:
And above All▪ Your self are One.
She hath inserted a few Toyes,
To please and profit the School-boyes.
I charge her, not disturb your pra'r,
(Though sometime she breaths holy ayr,

 And sings the LITURGY in verse:)
Nor unseasonably rehearse:
Bt wait▪ til, at you vacant time,
Yu please to listen to her Rime.
When you, THAT'S GOOD, vouchsafe to say;
That, ò that word's the Poëts Bay.





MAdam your Muse hath been in Labour too;
And she is now deliver'd, after you.
Her Off spring hath it's Fate, as you desire,
To live or▪ if you favour not, expire.
Bt may Yours last, and in all Grace-excell;
And be—what? The fair Mothers parallel.
