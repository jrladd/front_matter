WHen I had preached this Sermon, some of ill will, I think, to draw me into the jealousie and danger of the time, reported that I had meddled (I know not how) with the cere∣monies of the Church. A very strange thing, that meat, drink, apparell and pastime (for these are the indifferent things that I meddle withall) should sound in any wise mans eare, as the ceremonies of the Church. But such hearers we must sometimes meet withall, who will offer like violence to our words and meaning, as Cacus did to Hercules his oxen. Wherefore being provoked by this wrong, I took a little pains to look over my notes again, and setting my memory a work with them, I wrote out the Ser∣mon wholly and at large as here it is. Which when I had done, I saw nothing to the contrary therein (though I con∣fesse no great matter is to be seen in it) but that to some good minds (especially if friendly and lovingly disposed towards
 the poore and contemptible authour) it might be of some good use unto true godlinesse in this kind. And peradventure the presumption of putting it into the hands of some such per∣sons, might be as little sinne, as the casting of it aside into some dusty corner with other waste papers. Wherefore your selves being of such deserving towards me, as if there were any thing of worth in me, I must of necessity ow it to you; I am bold to put these papers (such as they are) into your lo∣ving hands: where if they do no other good, yet they shall testifie my thankfulnesse towards you, and be ready to clear my innocencie in that supposed crime, when need requires.
God give you both, with a happy and blessed new yeare, all renewments of his grace and holy Spirit, to his glory in you, and your endlesse comfort in him.
