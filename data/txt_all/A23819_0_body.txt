SIR,
FOr as much as the Period of the Grand Con∣spiracy
came forth as the First-Fruits of my
publick gratitude, I could not let this Appendix
walk abroad without your cognisance; which I
am therefore willing my self, & any thing of mine
should wear, because one Tongue is too little to
tell the world what a Patron I have had, & have;
and the good God grant I may long have.
It is I confess an easie thing for me to say thus,
and seriously it were an ill thing in me to say less;
for the greatest good that in this world I enjoy, it
came from your single Heart and free Hand.
Now after a Period, to talk of the Grand Con∣spiracy,
may seem that I had done before I had

made an end. But truly speaking: The Sub∣ject
of this Sermon, it is the survey of that Guilt
which the Grand Conspirators and their Abettors
acted and contracted before the other Sermons
could have a being: So that this is but a Label
to the Crown, and an Appendix to the sad Story.
The Drift of this onely is, to knock at every
door, to see how much of this guilt may lie in
every bosom; not to upbraid any, but to ex∣hort
all, so to examine, that our Penitence may
be proportionable to our Failings. For,
Though He fell by Open Enimies, yet he was
wounded in the House of his Friends. For whilst
they stood a far off, the diligent in mischief came
up close; whilst they were wary, the other were
working: so that a Non obstans lieth at many a
door, and a Non manifestans at as many. And
rare is that Subject, who in no measure was wan∣ting
to this Sacred Person. Let the Discourse
be your scrutiny; and the presentation of it, a
fresh but a short acknowledgment of his great
Obligations for abundant Kindnesses heapt upon
(My most honored Patron!)
