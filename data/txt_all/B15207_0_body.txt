My Lord,
TO giue testimonie of my thankefulnesse vnto you, for many fauours, and your honorable respect of me, I present you with this, the fruit of my leisure, for the which also I am beholden vnto you since my returne from the Armie before Rees; not that, as some may imagine, I meant to carrie Pearles into Persia, or Owles to Athens, bring you newes of that you know alreadie, better then my selfe, being interessed in this, as in all other the most important actions that concerne the Field in these vnited Provinces, hauing had your Regiment in the Armie, and these things done in a manner before your dore; but that, whatsoeuer I haue seene with mine owne eyes, or receiued by sound Relation of others, might vnder your name winne a better reputation with the
World, to whom I doe assure me, for your sake such as it is it will be welcome. The occasion of it was the satisfaction of many honorable and my worthy friends in England, who deâˆ£sired mee at my comming ouer (as it is commonly the parting request of friends) to write such newes as hapned, yea though a priuate iournall of things of small moment seene or done vpon the way, which haue also their delight aswell as the most serious affaires. For their sakes haue I done it, as also for mine owne priuate recreation in the Armie, who haue beene euer a profest Enemie vnto Idlenesse; I take my leaue, from BREDA in Brabant.
