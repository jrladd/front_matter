Honorable Knight:
THere are two especiall Causes that haue moued me most boldly to thrust these rude lines into the world: the first is my hearty affection to the ge∣nerality of the cause you vndertake, (which I beleeue God and his best seruants do affect:) and the other is my loue and seruice which I owe to your worthy selfe in particular, for many vndeserued friendships which I haue receiued from you, and many of your noble friends for your sake. Ingratitude is a Diuell, so farre worse then all the diuels, that if it should craue harbor

of me, in the likenesse of an Angell of light,yet I would neuer be perswaded to entertaine it. My thankfull acknowledge∣ment of your goodnesse towards mee is my prayers and best wishes, which shall euer be a poore requitall towards you, not forgetting my thanks in the behalfe of all the worthy Ladies and others of that Angelicall sex that are maried and re∣sident in London, whose chast honours you (as became a true Knight) defended, when an audacious Frenchman most slanderously did (without exception) swear there was not one honest woman dwelling within the boundes of this populous City, but that they had all generally abused the bed of mari∣age: then did your noble selfe inforce the pestiferous pesant to swallow his odious calumny, and in humility to confesse there were fifty thousand or a greater number that neuer had wronged their husbands in that vnlawfull act. I haue made bold to speake of this matter here, because the abuse was so generall, & your quarrell so honorable, which I think vnfit to be buried in silence or forgetfulnesse: howsoeuer, I craue you pardon and worthy acceptance, whilst I most obse∣quiously remaine
Euer to be commanded by you,
