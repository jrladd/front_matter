THE CVRTEOVS BE∣hauiour, the noble vertue, but speciallye the godlye zeale (Right honourable) which fame and report cer∣tefieth me to be in you, hath kindled such an earnest af∣fection in me, that my rude∣nesse, and base state stayeth mee nothing at all, to dedicate this simple worke vnto you. For I know that Nobilitie, gratefully accepteth at others hands slender giftes, and of small reputation, according to their habilitie that offer the same.
Artaxerxes, his good acceptation of a handfull of running water, made mee thus bolde, to offer this Pamphlet to your honour as a token of my good will: hoping that as he thought no disdain of the one, so you wil not take scorne of the other. Let me craue therefore this one thing, at your ho∣nours handes, that the basenesse of my translation of the learned Brentius procure not you, to refuse
 the patronage and defence of my slender woorke. Which as I know vndoubtedly shall neuer coun∣teruayle your worthinesse: so do I assuredly hope that it may be a proofe of my good will, and mea∣ning. The worthy Prophete IONAS, deserueth a worthie personage to be his defence and garde, a∣gaynst scoffing Lucian, and fretting Momus.
Wherefore, if your honor refuse not, but vouch∣safe, to take the same vpon you (as I perswade my selfe you will, weying the giuers intent, and seing that these are partly the first fruites of his trauaile) you shall not onely purchase immortall prayse of others: but I also shall be incouraged, and anima∣ted to greater, and waightyer attemptes: which I shall no sooner atchieue, but you shall be a witnes of my indeuours, and a rampire to my exploytes.
Thus hauing boldly required your honors assi∣stance, and tediously molested your eares with cir∣cumstaunces, leauing now at length to abuse your friendly pacience, I end: wishing to your honor the increase of Nobilitie, with a most happie estate, and after this lyfe, the gladsome ioyes of the euerlasting lyfe to come.

Beneficium dando accepit, qui digno dedit.
