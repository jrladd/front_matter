GReat Actions are not enterprised by vulgar
Spirits: without eminent Vertue, man
seldome riseth above private Interests: in this
designe, you have given the World a Testimo∣ny
of what Latitude your thoughts are, how
not to be circumscribed within the common narrow Li∣mits.
The Romans, in that glorious Age (which remaines
an Envy to all succeeding) imployed their most famed
Generals; in discovery of remotest Islands, and our owne
had the Honour to be invaded by the greatest Caesar: and
when he made his attempt here, the Indies can afford no
people more divided in it selfe then we were; more weake
in fortresses on land or ships at Sea: but time hath refor∣med
us to the Excellency we now so much glory in. The
Noblenesse of his Example serves you for encourage∣ment;
and I am certaine, the largenesse and fertility of
the Island of Madagascar, promiseth you a far more rich
returne: And it may be possible something of his Ho∣nour.
Before you could set saile, you met with a rough
storme at Land, and your Fleet was in danger of Wrack,
before it lanch't forth: but the opposition became your
advantage, and who laboured the ruine of your expedi∣tion,
rais'd it up, and confirm'd it on that height, that no En∣vy
now can undermine it, nor can it lye open to any future

question. The Parliament after full debate found how Just
and Honourable to the Kingdome was his Majesties Fa∣vour
to you, and by their approbation added a second
kind of Seale to your Patent. I here present you with the
Island you aime at, drawne in a little Tablet, the Cloath
course, and the colours poore, and ill laid, but it may cha∣lenge
the better reception, in regard it was taken to the life
by me an eye witnesse, in whom the memory of that fruit∣full
and pleasant Countrey so far prevailes, that it makes
me ambitious to forsake my Native, and wait upon you
thither: if you will please to admit me
Sir,
