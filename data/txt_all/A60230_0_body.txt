Could Hannibal, and Scipio, in whom
All the vast Hopes of Carthage, and of Rome,
Were fix'd, Revive, and see how eas'ly You,
By Your sole Virtue, Kingdoms can Subdue;
How from the Rage of War, without the Stain


Of Blood, You Sacred Crowns, and Triumphs gain:
They would no more contend, who best might claim
Priority; but yield it to Your Name.
Rome would her Gen'ral, Carthage Hers refuse,
And jointly You the World's Commander chuse.
