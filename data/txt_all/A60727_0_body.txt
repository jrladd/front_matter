HAving been some time since ingaged in the Service of the Army, I con∣sidered with my self, what course would be most proper and expedient, to discharge the Obligations of the Chaplain's Duty; And (I am of Opinion) That there is no way more useful, to his purpose, in order to promote the Practical Exercise of Religion, among the ordinary and private Soldiers, (who are generally very ignorant of the common Rudiments and Principles of Christianity) than to advise the frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures; which indeed, I found by sad ex∣perience, was shamefully neglected by some of them, to the great scandal and abuse of Re∣ligion. And this I chiefly impute to the want of Bibles among them: for I dare say, were a strict search and enquiry made in every Re∣giment of the Army, we should not find many possess'd of this Holy Treasure, which does so nearly concern the necessary good and Salva∣tion of their Precious and Immortal Souls. And therefore, to supply that defect, or rather the want of Holy Instruction from those sacred
Oracles of God's inspired Word, give me leave, I pray you, to dedicate to your use this small Bible, or Summary of Devotional Scripture, which being of a lesser size, is more fitly ac∣commodated for the Soldier's carriage, and may be in some sense, as useful, as it contains a brief Collection of all those necessary and pertinent Txts, which are adapted for a Sol∣dier's Christian Duty and Service, in the time of War. And which, as it may serve to in∣struct the more ignorant and unlearned in the common rules and ways of Salvation; so (I hope) it will not altogether prove useless or in∣sufficient to remember those who are more know∣ing of their Christian Duty and Calling, that so both may become more sincerely vertuous and Religions towards God, and honestly faith∣ful and serviceable to the Interest of Their Majesties present Government, as they desire to serve the common Rights and Liberties of the Church and Nation. And now I humbly desire all the chief Officers and Commanders of Their Majesties Army, (to whose faour I present this small Treatie, or Religious Ex∣ercise of Devotional Scripture) that they will be pleased to give in strict charge or command to all their subalterns, both Officers and Sol∣diers, that this may be read by them, as they have leisure and opportunity, either in the Camp or Garison; and especially to those who are engaged in Their Majesties Service
both in Holland and Ireland, for whom I have fitted those Holy Collects, or Offices of Morning and Evening Prayer, in the Close of this Book, which will not be improper to be used by every particular Officer or Soldier, who keeps constant to the Exercise of daily De∣votion; and besides, 'tis necessary that he do reflect upon some of those Holy Passages of Scripture, which I have here reduced under so many several Heads, which I judged to be most proper for the Soldier's Christian Duty, during his Service in the Wars.
And now, because among the private Men, the Education of some is so Illiterate, that they cannot Read; I have thought of this expedient to help the ignorant, which is, That his fellow Soldier or Comrade do by frequent reading in∣culcate unto his Memory, some few of those chief Texts or Portions of Holy Scripture.
And if these Orders and Rules of Religion be strictly observed and put in Execution by you, who are the chief Officers, you will soon find the benefit of this Holy Discipline to be not only serviceable to your seives, in keeping your Men orderly and sober in their Behviour; and so no less quietly submissive and obedient to the Words of your Command. But then, what is more happy, this will be in some measure greatly instrumental for the publick. Service of Religi∣on, in reforming those Scandalous Vices and Immoralities of Drunkenness and Swearing,
which are so generally risen among the more Ignoble and Plebeian sort. And thus you will come to gain not only the credit of esteem and Reputation to your selves, but you will do no less real honour and service to Their Majesties by your diligence and fidelity in this present juncture, wherein we must expect either the lasting happi∣ness or intire Ruine of the Peace and Prosperity of this Church and Nation; as God is pleased to give success to Their Majesties Arms, which (we all know) are now chiefly engaged to maintain the free Exercise of our Religion, which is so happily modelled according to the excellent Doctrine and Precepts of the Holy Bible; And of which this being a small Epitome, or Part, I hope it will come the more acceptable for that publick Good and Practical Exercise of Holiness, for which 'tis chiefly intended, for the use of those Officers and Soldiers, who are now employ'd a∣broad in Their Majesties Service, for the common safety and defence of our Religion and Country, and to which I pray God give a Blessing, that we may all fight the good fight of faith, to lay hold of eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
