SIR,
LUcasta (fair, but hapless Maid!)
Once flourisht underneath the shade
Of your Illustrious Mother; Now,
An Orphan grown, she bows to you!
To YOU, Her vertues noble Heir,
Oh may she find protection there;
Nor let her welcome be the less
Cause a rough hand makes her Addresse,

One (to whom Foes the Muses are)
Born and Bred up in Rugged War;
For, Conscious how unfit I am,
I only have pronounc'd her Name,
To waken pity in your Brest,
And leave Her Tears to plead the Rest.
SIR,
