SIR,

When I had compos'd these ragâˆ£ged lines,
Much like the Beare who brings her young ones forth,
In no one part well featur'd, she repines,
That such a lumpe of flesh should haue a birth:
Which to reforme, she's said to vndertake
A second taske, and licks them into shape.


So I producing these vnriper seedes,
Scarce growne to their perfection, knew not how,
(Since different humour, different censure breeds)
How they should come to ripenesse, but by you:
Whose faire acceptance may such count'nance show,
As you may others moue to grace them too.


Nor do I doubt but these shall purchase grace,
'Mongst such as honour vertue, for how low
So'ere the style be, Subiect is not base,
But full of Diuine matter; and I know,
The Sunne giues life, as well to simple weeds,
As vnto flowers or other fruitfull seeds.
