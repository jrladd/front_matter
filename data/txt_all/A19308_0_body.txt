Madam,
I Had, and haue buried a good wife, since which time, God hath not dis∣posed of me in a second mariage; by reason wher∣of,
 I haue not a Child of my body: being single, I conuerted to my selfe, and (I know not how) my braine became in la∣bour, and is deliuered of this (I know not what to call it:) it is not worthy the name of a booke, ex∣cept your Ladiship will deigne to patronage it, and giue it desert, which fauour if your Ladiship indulge towards me, then my Booke like some meane man, that hath been entertained by some great personage, vnder
 the protection of your fauorable approbation, shall walk abroad with∣out shame of it owne vn∣worthines: and my selfe shall remaine, as alwayes I shall haue cause to doe from your former large fauours:
