WHen I had determined (Right honorable) to dedi∣cate this Booke, to the euer∣lyuing vertues of that match∣lesse Knight Syr Phillip Syd∣ney; me thought that I could not finde out a more Noble personage then your selfe, and more fit, to patro∣nize, shield, and defende my dutie to the deade, then your Honour, whose greatnes is such, and vertues of that power, as who so commendeth them, deserueth not to be accounted a flatterer, but he that doth not the same, may be thought an



euill willer. Hovv your Honor vvill accept here∣of, I make no doubt, because that curtesie atten∣deth vpon true nobilitie; but my humble request is, that your Honor may not thinke of me (by the tytle of the Booke, and some part of the discourse) as if I vvere amorous, and did speake according to my ovvne passions, for I beeing restrained of my liberty, and helde in the graue of obliuion, where I still as yet remaine, oppressed with Me∣lancholie, and wearied vvith deeper studies, I vvas glad to beguile the time with these conceits, anothomising in them, the vanitie of this life, and vncertaintie of the delights therof, in the Dreame of Poliphilus; Which if it shall please your Honor at conuenient leysure to looke ouer, pardoning what you finde amisse, and weighing my good will, I shall thinke my selfe most happy.
And thus I humbly take my leaue, vntill that I may present your Honour, with a matter more fitting the same.
