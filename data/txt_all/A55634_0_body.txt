I Lookt upon the following Narrative as justly due to the World, whe∣ther I respected my Self or You: for as I am bound to disburden my own Conscience by a full and Impartial Discovery of what I know, relating to this horrid, detestable Popish Plot, and to endeavour to render my Acknowledgments as publick as the Evils wherein I ve been involv'd; So I am under the Obligations of Charity to Contri∣bute All I can to your Iuformation and Satisfaction, That both the present¦ge, and Posterity may take right Measures of Popery, as a thing so destru∣ctive to Government and Humane Society in general, and so directly oppo∣e to all the Ennobling, Holy, Humble, Meek and Peaceable Designs of True ristianity, That the Better Roman-Catholick any person is, the worse man becomes, and look how much more devout, so much the more dangerous.
For as when the Philistins had once deprived Sampson of his sight, they de him grinde in their Mill at their pleasure; so when people shut their es, and give up themselves to be led blindfold by the Nose with a strong uceit, That they are Embarked in a Church that cannot Err, (which is the  Corner-stone of the Romish Building, and the first Principle they in∣e; although in truth, by that Church is meant nothing more than the surping, Domineering Pope, and his Covetous, Juggling, Self-designing y;) After, I say, they are brought into this slavish hoodwinkt condition,  wonder, if they be led forwards by the same men, to the most wick∣ Practices, as well as false Opinions. For as the Understanding is directed, the man, if he have any thing of a zealous temper, or be firm to the Reli∣gion he professes, will suitably Act, and comsequently may with ease be sedu∣d to think he does God the best service, when indeed he most violates all aws of God, Nature and Man.
This I may the more firmly avouch, because I must acknowledge my selt
to have been an unhappy Example of it, and therefore although these al minable Principles and Practices of the Roman Church are already excellen laid open by a multitude of Learned men, (for She has bestow'd too ma sad instances thereof on the World, and this Nation in particular,) Yet wha have to say, being matter of Fact, so lately done, and wherein I my self  so nearly concern'd, it may (though never so meanly delivered,) possibly w some be of use, more effectually to prevail with them.
The matters herein discovered are of a various, but all of them of a m black and villainous nature; some relate to the Plot in general, wher you may perceive how far the design was spread, and how no small numb (to my knowledge) were privy thereunto, and certainly the poison m be most virulent at the Root when so many little Twiggs were therewith in∣cted. You will find here (besides what hath been already discovered a proved by others) notice of a cursed hand that durst resolve to attempt t Sacred Life of our most Gracious Soveraign; a Prince, who besides the a∣ful stamp of Heaven in his Character and Dignity, and the dread Life-gua of Sacred Precepts, Not to touch the Lords Anointed, carries in His Pers such charms of Sweetness, Goodness, Clemency and Indulgence, as mig secure him from Violence even amongst Heathens and Savages; but no Qu∣lity or Innocence is Armour of proof against a Popish Knife; no Virtue su∣ficient to guard any from the Assassinations of a throow-pac'd Jesuited R∣man-Catholick.
And certainly the Murther of that Loyal Protestant-Magistrate, Sir Emund-bury Godfrey, was a thing so hellish in it self, and yet through Go Over-ruling Providence, so very considerable in its influences to this poo Nations preservation, That I am confident it will be no mean satisfaction t all good Protestants to be ascertained of all (even the smallest) Circumstan∣ces relating thereunto; which as far as came within my knowledge, I have here freely and faithfully set forth, without adding a word beyond the Truth out of prejudice, or any sinister end; or concealing any thing for my ow Reputation; For though to commit Sin be the greatest of shame, yet ingeni∣ously and penitently to confess it, to the Glory of God, and warning of ou Neighbour, is no disgrace, but the greatest Honour, and the best service a se∣duced Criminal can be capable of, or able to perform.
Nor was their other Conspiracy against the Life of that Noble Lord, th Right Honourable the Earl of Shaftsbury herein likewife set forth, less wick∣ed and barbarous on their part in the design, though frustrated by the Pro∣vidence of God, who I trust will continually bring to nought all the mischie∣vous Counsels of these Romish Achitophels, and cast the cruel Devices of such Assassinates on their own heads.

As for that part which concerns the Ill Lives of several of their Priests, e same is not inserted out of any Spleen or Ill will to their Persons, (for to veral of them in the Course of my Trade I have been beholden, as far as ey were my Customers) but to give our English World a Taste of the pra∣ces of the Leading men of that Apostate Church, and to perswade, if pos∣le, Lay-Romanists, to consider what kind of Persons they are, on whose eves they so blindly pin their Faith, and to whose Conduct they Trust in atter of such unspeakable Importance, as the Salvation or Eternal destru∣on of their Souls: And this I the rather recommend, and hope may be valent with others, because it had some weight with my self; for next to ections on the odious Plot they were carrying on, and the vile murther y had engaged me in, The certain knowledge of the close hypocrisie or fs Prophaness and lewd Lives of their Ghostly Fathers (at least most of se I had the unhappiness to be intimately acquainted with, which were  a few, though I accuse not All in that particular) had a strong Influence awaken my thoughts to quit their Communion; As conceiving that must a bad Cause which us'd such wicked means to support it, and that it was way likely That should be the true Religion, which had no better Influ∣e on the Conversations of those who were its Priests and chief Promoters. The far greatest part of this whole Narrative hath already been attested up∣ Oath: As for the rest that is therein asserted, as on my own knowledge, I ll at any time be ready to justifie and prove the same: And what I received information from others, is every where so expressed, with the Reasons  circumstances inducing the credit I gave thereunto. For as I was educa∣ amongst them from my Childhood, so I had a great acquaintance and iliarity with many of the Fathers and most zealous persons of that party ut the Town, having been several years her Majesties Goldsmith, & the f of my Trade depending on Priests & others of the Rom. Cath. perswasion. The reason why I presume to dedicate this mean Narrative to so great a y as all you worthy Protestants in general, seemeth to me just, because sin∣ and excusable, because in some sort necessary; I make you as it were All ies to these Presents, not only that there may be so many living witnesses nst me, if ever either there should be any wilful untruth found therein, or  I should fall back, (which God forbid) from that pure Religion which you ess, and I most cordially though lately have embraced; but also more espe∣y thereby to engage your united Prayers to God, as well for my perseve∣ and growth in Christian knowledge, as for my preservation against the ce of those restless enemies, from whom I am to expect the worst that ∣revenge can suggest, or cruel malice execute; partly for my relinquish∣ment
of them, but much more for disclosing some of their Proceed  wherein already they have not been wanting, for besides lies and slander  dustriously spread, to vilifie and make me odious, and the depriving me (as  as in them lies) of the means of a Livelihood, I was of late credibly infor of a resolved design against my life, and that three persons had dogged  for some time for that purpose: But the Lord is my God, of whom then shall  afraid? To his infinite protection I resign my self, and next under m to  of his Vicegerent, from whose most Gracious Majesty, as like who from the ∣ble Lords of his most Honourable Council, as well as the Right Honourable the House of Peers, I have upon all occasions found all just encouragement and very great indulgence, which with a thankful heart I desire to com morate, and publish for the encouragement of others.
The Romanists (especially the Jesuits and Priests, who sway the res their pleasure) are a most vigilant and unwearied sort of people to propag their false Doctrines, and spread their tyranny; I speak it experimenta who have had the advantage in a great measure to know them; no defeat  daunt them, nor scarce any disappointments discourage them: no sooner is  Plot discovered, but they presently lay another. For 'tis a Rule that th Priests injoyn their people to believe, I may I am confident say of most,  firmly as their Creed, that their Religion shall infallibly one day or other  restored and established again in England; and being thus verily perswad they bear up under all Miscarriages, and still vigorously pursue the main sign, though in new methods, and with different Instruments. And therefor will certainly concern Protestants to be as careful and active to prevent th designs, and preserve their own Religion and Lives, as the other are to  stroy both: you have now an opportunity put into your hands to crush  Cockatrices egg: O may you all in your several places and stations impro it with wisdom, and with courage, and with integrity: For if the neck of th Design be not now throughly broken, if Popery be not now ham-strung  England; if the Serpents head be not bruiz'd, and the Vitals destroyed,  may justly be feared, that it will revive again, and then the Plot will be o laid to sleep, & not prevented, & the latter end prove worse than the beginning.
But who am I, to advise so great and so wise a Body? May the God of Wis∣dom advise you and direct you, and protect you in his Truth and in his fe And so begging all your Prayers on my behalf, I shall conclude, and subscr my self.
 Covent-Garden, May 26 1679.
