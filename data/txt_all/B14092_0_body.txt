My Lord:
THe Extension of your Noble Favours Com∣mands, and my Gratitude no lesse binds
 me to present this Elabo∣rate Peece, of our learned and judicious Poet Ben Ionson his Translation of Horace de Arte Poetica, to your Lordships peru∣sall: which Book amongst the rest of his Strenuous and Sinewy Labours, for its rare profundity, may challenge a just admirati∣on of the Learned in this and future Ages, and crowne his name with a lasting memory of never
 dying glory! You right∣ly knew (my Lord) the worth and true esteeme both of the Author and his Learning, being more perspicuous in the can∣did judgement of Your Lordship, and other sub∣lime Spirits that rightly knew him, then my capa∣city can describe. But there is from me a iust duty and service due to your Honour, which makes me assume this boldnesse,
 yet in some good assu∣rance that your Goodnesse will be pleas'd to accept of this as a true acknow∣ledgment, and profession of my most humble thank∣fulnesse, by which my Lord you shall dignifie the purpose of him who shall alwayes study to be ac∣counted
