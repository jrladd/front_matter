VOuchsafe, great Treasurer, to turne your eye,
And see the opening of a Grecian Mine;
VVhich, VVisedome long since made her Treasury;
And now her title doth to you resigne.
VVherein as th'Ocean walks not, with such waues,
The Round of this Realme, as your VVisedomes seas;
Nor, with his great eye, sees; his Marble, saues
Our State, like your Vlyssian policies:
So, none like HOMER hath the VVorld enspher'd;
Earth, Seas, & heauen, fixt in his verse, and mouing;
VVhom all times wisest Men, haue held vnper'de;
And therefore would conclude with your approuing.
Then grace his spirit, that all wise men hath grac't,
And made things euer flitting, euer last.



Robert Cecyl, Earle of Salisburye.
Curbfoes; thy care, is all our erly Be.
