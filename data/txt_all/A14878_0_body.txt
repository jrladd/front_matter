SYR, purposing to impose some taske on my wandring thoughts so to re∣uerse their somewhat vncomfortable strayings, my rasher election sud∣dainly singled out this subiect, which though suting too neerely with my braine in barrennes, the product is this Pamphlet, which perused by some friends of iudge∣ment, was pronounced worthy the Presse. Wherevn∣to I the rather referr'd it, that dedicating the same vnto you, I might (at least) manifest my remembrance of that loue, kindnesse, and courtesie, which (while my resi∣dence was in loued Leycester-shire,) made mee so much affect that Familiaritie, which you then pleased to af∣foord me, in regard wherof my loue leades me to pre∣sent this to your patronage, and your affection to Poe∣sie, makes mee presume of your acceptance: the grace you giue a Verse in reading it, makes it pleasing, if it be
but passable, therefore I doubt not your liking. And if this (which is not vnlike) gaine your approbation, I shall not passe for the Censures of such as are more apt to finde fault, then able to finde a faulte. Had I but the name of a Poet, and opinion on my side, I should relye therevpon as Caesar on his Fortune, yet doth not my obscuritie discourage mee, but rather the contra∣rie, for Fame is rather to be ventred for then ventred.
An instigation to the writing hereof, was the com∣mendation which I heard a Iudicious diuine giue of a yong Student in diuinity, for his dexteritie in English Poesie, who affirming it to be an ornament to any pro∣fession, I was thereby induced to reduce that affection I bore it, to practise. And in publishing the same I haue imitated Apelles, who hauing drawne a picture plea∣sing to himselfe, hang'd it in open viewe, that he might heare the verdite of others. Nor is it vnlike but I also shall haue a shoo-maker Censuring the Legge, when his skill extends but to the latcher. So (referring it to your fauourable suruey, and kinde acceptance) I hum∣bly desire Almightie God to Crowne you, and your adopted-selfe, with his best blessings in this life, and with Immortall glory in the next.
