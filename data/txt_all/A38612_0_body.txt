THe deceased King, Father of your Majesty, was pleased to command the impression of a Ma∣nuscript which was the first fruits of my Pen, on which hee
daigned to cast his eyes; where in his Royall goodnesse had more respect to my zeale, then to the worke. This which I offer at your Majesties feet, carries its deniall on the front. But that the clemencie of him who was pleased to cast his eye upon the Hysop, as well as upon the Cedars of Lebanon, makes me hope for a fa∣vourable Aspect. I beseech the Lord God to accept your oblations, and make your Crowne flourish, and establish your Throne as the Sun it selfe.
