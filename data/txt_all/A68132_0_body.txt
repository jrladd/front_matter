IF IT BE
an offence
(my noble
LORD)
to shew our
Affections
vnto those
wee honor
in any ob∣iect
of du∣tyfullnesse
whatsoeuer:
then haue I offended, and must kneele

for remission. But if loue and grati∣tude
be law dable effects, in what forme
soeuer they appeare, then haue not I
broken any condition of decorum, in
consecrating this worke to your illu¦strious
honour. It bare the badge of
an honorable Patron in the originall:
and I could make it doe no lesse in the
translation. And for mine election,
the worlds generall decay of the e∣steeme
of learning, in those breasts
that haue best meanes to support it,
and the farre-spread fame of your
glory, by that Phoenix-bounty that
hath left all the land to build her nest
in your bosome, these motiues haue
more then induced mee to approache
so neere that bright lustre your Ho∣nour
lights the world with, as to
beare one part in the Hymnes of your
prayses, by this dutifull dedication▪
And (good my Lord) herein bee▪ you
my seauen-sold shield against the shout
of all those blistered mouthes, whose
most felicitie is to mis-interprete most

maliciouslie: Or doe but giue mee
foote-holde, and then let mee alone
to beate all their disgraces about their
owne eares, and the whole worlds, in
a true Satyrick furie; in an Ariostoes
Swanne, that shall snatch their names
from times all-wasting skirt, and beare
them vp, to euer-lasting recorde in the
Temple of Infamie. But for my dutie
to your sacred vertues, let this expresse
mee: I will bee that Bolognian dogge,
whose faith purchased him this Epi∣aph:
that hee did alwayes
Latrai a ladri, & a gli amanti tacqui, &c.Barke lowd at theeues, and make them euer faile:
But whē friends came, lay down, & wagd his taile.
Such am I: consecrated to your Lord∣ships
seruice: and vnder the protecti∣on
of this mine owne zeale, aduen∣ture
to present you with A discoue∣rie
and no discouerie, of a world and no
world, both knowne and vnknowne, by a

traueller that neuer trauelled. Written
first in Latine, and no Latine, and now
translated, and yet not translated, by
the same man, yet not the same
man that first of all
pend it.
