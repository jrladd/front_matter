MADAM,
AS my many Obligations to your Name, in both your
Relations of Husband and Brother, have long
since claim'd from me a Publique Acknowledge∣ment,
so those to your Person have created in me
a Confidence, not only to obtain Pardon for this Presumption,
but a Protection of this Innocent Stranger, who durst not
venture abroad without it. Such is his Innocency, that in
this habit he might, without Gaule to the Spectators, have
enter'd the Theater (had not the Guilty Ones of this Age,
broken that Mirrour lest they should there behold their own
horrible Shapes represented) but now he is faine to seeke
Sanctuary, which cannot be found, but at the Altar of an
Immaculate Vertue, which (Madam) all that are so happy
as to know you, confesse to be raised in your Name, under
whose shadow, as under Laurell, poore Lysis will not onely be
secured from the Thunder of the Times, but I shall be absol∣ved
from my Errors, and confirm'd, with all Devotion, to
continue in all Gratitude,
(Madam)
