SIR,
I Confess it is but a weak Apology for my Con∣fidence in prefixing your Name to this Book, to tell you that I can more easily satisfie the World, than your self in making this Dedication; though indeed it be all that I have to say for my self,
for this Trouble I give you. The truth is, Sir, since most Books now a∣days do court, what but a few deserve, I mean, Protection; as I would not be singular in Pub∣lishing this Translation without a Patron, so I durst not be so unjust to the intrinsick value of the Treatise, as to send it into the English World no other ways provided than with the Credentials of a specious recommendati∣on to the train of some
great Man, who, perhaps after all, would not admit it into his Family with∣out your Approbation. It was therefore in imitati∣on of the Ingenious Au∣thor of this Book, who gave me a Precedent for Dedication, that follow∣ing the guidance of Uni∣versal, and therefore least erring Fame, I was led to your Door, there to leave this Foreign Child, which I have taught to speak (I hope) intelligible English, to be by you disposed of
in the World, according as you shall think it de∣serves, & as you are plea∣sed to give it a Character. If it may be able to serve those that serve you in that Famous Hospital, where you successfully Operate, or prove Useful to any that profess Litho∣tomy, that laudable, but difficult and dangerous part of Chirurgery; you are in the judgment of most men the fittest Judge; so that the Publick (I make no doubt) will justifie my
Conduct in submitting it to your Censure. But, Sir, how you your self will Interpret this attempt of mine, I dare not affirm; seeing Fortune hath not encouraged me to it by intitling me to those free∣doms that mutual Con∣versation & long Friend∣ship do allow: However, Sir, I will not despair but that the kind Acceptance my endeavours shall meet with in the World, will so far interceed for me, that what is intended, and re∣ally
found to conduce to Publick Good, will not be thought by you to want any private Motives to commend it to your Pa∣tronage. I shall say no more, lest by seeming to know you better than in∣deed I do, I should spoil my own Plea, and appear to be an Intimate Friend, when in reality I am,
Sir, 
London, Sept. 23. 1682.
