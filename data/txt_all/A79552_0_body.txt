MY LORD,
SInce I first began
this translation,
your Lordship has
stil encourag'd me
to go on with it, and when I
had ended it, I could not

but think it unfirnish't, till
I had prefixt your name to
it. I have alwaies told your
Lordship that I had no vani∣ty
to own my imperfections:
and if I thought my confi∣dence
to print this Treatise
a fault, I would smother ra∣ther
then publish it. But ha∣ving
most seriously weighed
the content and satisfaction
the originall brought to my
selfe, after I had taken the
paines to translate it, I re∣solv'd
to make it communi∣cable
to as many as please to
read Saint Chrysostome in my
English. And though it par∣ticularly

aimes at fallen
Theodorus, and as at him, so
at every dissolute person;
the most opinionated reser∣ved
men may read it, and
perhaps somtimes find them∣selves
not a little concern'd
in it. For it most particular∣ly
treats against desperati∣on;
which is a disease lyable
to the greatest confidence.
Especially when the very
same men (who have had
the severe curiosity almost
to blind their brethren with
plucking the motes out of
their eyes) shall be brought
to consider the beames that

are in their own: so great
and just often proves their
doome, who are not fore∣warn'd
by our Saviour not
to judge lest they be
judged.
My Lord, This treatise
of the holy Father, signally
invites us to be our owne
Physicians: and sincerely to
arraigne our soules before
the face of Heaven; it in∣structs
us how to prize the
beauties God has endowed
our minds with, unlesse wee
soyle them with our owne
negligence; it teaches us to
preferre the care of our souls

above all earthly alurements
though baited with the most
tempting delights; and may
well then be a fit mission
from a Prison to those in the
greatest liberty; for men in
restraint (while they are
most forbid vanities) begin
to know then most truly
what they are; for all decei∣ving
delights possesse us like
the Devil; they take our wits
from us; but the correcting
hand of God, whilst we are
in the troubles and miseries
of this world, prepares us
for a better; and here wee
shall find weapons and arms
fit for the fiercest conflict of

that nature, here (my
Lord in this translation
which I dedicate to you
with that infinite desire I
have ever to be esteemed
