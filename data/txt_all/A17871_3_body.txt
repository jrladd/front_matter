SHould I presume to separate you now,
That were so lately ioyn'de by holy vow?
For whome this golden dreame which I report,
Begot so many waking eyes at Court,
And for whose grace so many nobles chang'd,
Their names and habites from themselues estrang'd?
Accept together, and together view
This little worke which all belongs to you,
And liue together many blessed dayes,
To propagate the honour'd name of HAYES.


Haeredem (vt spes est) pariet noua nupta Scot' Anglū,
Quem gignet post hac ille, Britannus erit.
Sicnoua posteritas ex regnis orta duobus,
Vtrinquè egregios nobilitabit auos.
