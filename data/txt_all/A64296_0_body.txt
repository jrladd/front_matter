Madam,
IT is my Duty to give you an account of spending my Houres, whose vertu∣ous directions hath still enjoy∣ned me the imployment of them in the best things: and there can be no endevour comparable to the Inquest after Truth. Happy are Mens early imbra∣ces of that most worthy mistres of Mans soule; when the Son
 of their Judgement rises free from those Clouds and Mists, which otherwayes by long as∣cending, time, and endevour, they would be but hardly able to expell. I must acknowledge my weakenesses, and errors, knowing it is the Victory of Christianity, to conquer the Pride of a Mans owne un∣derstanding, and whose vigor is shewed in our lowest sub∣missions. The World is like that Nymph, which still de∣stroyed those, to whom she most seemed faire; And Men in
 the short course of life, heape up to themselves a sort of Opinions and Passions, and make them the faithlesse guides of their lives, of which though they highly esteeme, yet doe they but dwell under those barren Hills which are never without Clouds and Showres discending thence: And who would for the love of that, which in a moment perishes, refuse to pro∣fesse that, which will bestow on him Eternity; and in a con∣fusion of all humane things, will render him a felicity solid and
 durable? I shall shew you what Port my Thoughts have arrived at, to escape the stormes of Error, and from thence to despise the severall Winds of Doctrine with which Men are much tost, but never Saile; and through the diversity of Opinions, halfe of them Pray for those Winds, whereby the rest are Drowned. The name of Rome, but once Named, some Mens minds become sur∣charged with the apprehensions of Superstition, Conspiracy; and what evills throng not in∣to
 their conquerd Imaginati∣on? whereas they being got out of the Magicke Circle of parties, (where their minds are Conjured with the Devill of Faction) they finde that to be the place, which did commend to the whole World, The Faith of the Romans. And where Christian Profession hath with infinite sufferings and perse∣cutions triumphed over the Armed Power of its Ad∣versaries, and foure hundred Heresies that have sprung up before Luther; such high dis∣pleasures
 Men have entertai∣ned against those Names which they looking directly on with the Eye of Reason, would perceive ingraven the well-drawne Lines of Truth; they by going on one side, looking with the Eye of Passion, draw the same Figures and Lines, by a deceit of the Eye, to beare an unhandsome pro∣portion. We intertaine Chri∣stian Profession, and the Sacred Word of God (the Records of it) delivered over to us upon a Divine infallible testi∣mony,
 which is that of the holy Catholique Church, to which he hath promised his holy spi∣rit to the Worlds end. Where∣fore if Men would inlarge their thoughts, and take a free and open view of all the parts of the Fabricke of Christia∣nity, and shall consider of that power which he hath left to his Church, of his injunctions to heare his Church, of his promises to assist his Church; The Gates of Hell shall not prevaile against it; to re∣maine as a Light upon a
 Hill: How great comfort must it needs rayse in the Hearts of Christians, to finde this made good, in a constant un-interrup∣ted succession of Bishops from Saint Peter? Let God be true, and every man a lyar. The Church of Rome lo∣cally, is but a particular Church; but let them not offer affront to the Divine good∣nesse, through abuse of Wit, or Logicall trifle (of a Ʋniversall particular) for the Church of Rome hath ever defended the Catholique cause; and
 antiquity hath ascribed unto it a more powerfull principa∣lity, calling Her, The Mo∣ther of Churches; though the Holy Catholique church is ever the same; like the Ocean, which as it beats upon severall Countries with its Waves, begets se∣verall Names; being now called the French Sea, then the Spanish. Those Madam who are possest with prejudice against the Sea of Rome, have all different wayes of maintaining their opposition;
 neither will they agree to the judgement of any one Tribu∣nall; the same Arguments have not the same effects with its different enemies; but like Wards in a Key, they are to be fitted to the diversity of parties, and capacities, to un∣locke their judgements, fast bound with error: It being truely said, That not the perfection of Reason, but the proportion doth pre∣vaile. Some retain still some∣thing in the bottome of the Box, and will not let it see
 the Light by conference, lest it fly away; accounting it the surest tenure of Truth, to stick with obstinacy in the quicksands of error, and esteeme it their best title to it, to refuse to dispute it. A∣nother Measures Truth by the temper of indifferency, and esteemes it to be the safest way to be freed from Error, to be willing to capitulate. A third frames his own prin∣ciples, and by Reasons and deductions drawne thence, makes all their Discourse agree
 well enough with it selfe; As Astronomers, some of them making the Earth to move: some the Heavens; and by both Doctrines, according to their principles layd downe, make up their Phai∣nomena, and appearances; but tell them of Antiquity, Fathers, and the Councels, they will answer you with that Merchant, that hung out for his Signe, Books set on fire; so that if any desired to have been Trusted, or to have come in his Bookes; He answered
 them, That they were bur∣ned: so if you would get any beleife from them, from Libraries and Bookes, their Zeale hath already Burnt them. Another sort are wit∣tily placed, betwixt a Puritan and a Priest; If the Priest urge Councels and Fathers, they turne to the Puritan, and steale the Bible out of his pocket, to confute him with: And if the Puritan urge the Bible, then he turns to the Priest, and borrowes of him the Decrees and
 Councels, to defend him∣selfe with. Children, saith Aristotle, call every one Mother; but comming to the use of Reason, they then acknowledge onely their true Mother. Thus doe Men beare their spirituall Allegi∣ance, drest up in severall garbes and formes, and apply to themselves the benefits of that stupendous Mistery of our Redemption, by the severall Conduits and Channels of their owne Fancies: but God is both the Way, the Meanes,
 and the End; He hath made compleat the designati∣ons of his Grace, and Men will be found to be more in love with the Meanes, then the End, and to empty all their Zeales and Devotions into some new Mode in Reli∣gion, or particular Opinion, whereby they are differenced from others: They hold such a course, that doe make them seem to be desirous to take our Saviour by the Hand, over the backe of his Church; whereas he hath said of his
 Embassadors, which were to continue to the Worlds End; Who heares not you, heares not me. But Madam, its more agreeable to you, and more contentfull, to cast the Lines of ones Thoughts into the smooth and pleasant waters of Devotion, which wash the beautifull Walls of Sion, ra∣ther then into the boysterous Sea of Controversie, for which my Barke is too little; and I ever returning thence Sea-sicke: but onely induced Ma∣dam to give your selfe, and
 some other of my worthy Friends satisfaction: In the performance of which, I shall little value the Censure of those who suffer themselves to be carried away with that easie fault of Fault-finding; And doe beseech your Ladyship to give me your Blessing:
