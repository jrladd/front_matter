May It please your Highness,
THe two small Books, which I did presume to present unto your High∣ness, were so kindly accep∣ted, that having no otherway in any measure to acknow∣ledge this favour, but the

Dedication of this, I thought I could do no less, than to dedicate it unto so good, so wise, meek, and generous a Person as your self; being not only a true and sincere Pro∣testant, nor only a living Member, but also an unmo∣veable Pillar of the holy Ca∣tholick Church; and though Jesus Christ said, that the Gates of Hell should not pre∣vail against it, yet the Devil having a root of Evil, and enmity in himself, night and day seeks its destruction: To effect which, he subtilly, Pro∣teus-like, appears in different

forms, assaulting it several ways; either by raising a∣gainst it those of the Church of Rome, insinuating that we, being separated from them, are excluded all hopes of Salvation; and that they are bound with fire and sword to seek our utter ruine and destruction; or insinu∣ating to other Dissenters from the Church of England, that to live up to the strict Rule and Principles of the Christian Religion, they are obliged to separate them∣selves from it. This Maxime is received in Philosophy,

Sublatâ causâ tollitur effectus, the Cause being removed, the Effect ceaseth; therefore when I have made appear, that those Insinuations of Satan are deceitful, and that the belief and practice of the Church of England is con∣formable to the holy Scrip∣ture, I hope I shall be able to bruise the head of that old Serpent, and to procure the Church's peace; especially having for my Patron so vertuous a Prince, so great a lover of Peace, so good a Member, and so strong a Pillar of the holy Catholick

Church. I do not here in∣tend any Panegyrick, know∣ing your Highness takes much greater pleasure in do∣ing good, than in hearing the repeated Ecchoes of your Princely Merits, looking on your Noble Virtues, as a fit∣ter Subject for the Records of Honour, in which your Highness will be praised to all succeeding Ages. There your brave and warlike Acti∣ons, Wisdom, Prudence, Goodness, piercing and so∣lid Understanding in all Sci∣ences and Affairs, discreet Conduct, and diligent Cares

for the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, and Catholick Faith, against all Superstitions, Errors, Ido∣latries, and cruel Persecuti∣ons of the Church of Rome, will be much better descri∣bed, than I could here have done with my Pen. There every one may read, that at 13 years of Age, your High∣ness march'd to the Siege of Rhynberg. At the Age of 18 Commanded a Regiment of Horse in the German Wars, in 1642 came into England, fought and defeated Colo∣nel Sands near Worcester;

routed the Rebels Horse at Edge-hill; took Cirencester; raised the Siege of Newark; recovered Litchfield and Bri∣stol; fought the great Battle at Marston-moor, and in 1666 being joyned Admiral with the Duke of Albemarle, attackt the whole▪ Dutch Fleet in such a bold resolute, but prudent and discreet way, that you soon put the Enemy to the flight. And though we live in an Age, wherein every one seems to be free to speak what he will, and not to spare even those whom they have no rea∣son

to speak against; yet no∣thing can be said, but in your Praise and Commen∣dation. I conclude this E∣pistle, humbly begging of your Highness to accept of this small Treatise. I could have enlarged it, had I not known that Princes, who are commonly incumbred with several important Affairs, have no time to read great Volumes. When your spare∣hours will allow to make a perusal of this, which though little, yet contains much, I hope your Highness will receive some satisfaction,

and see that my whole inten∣tion is to wish the Peace of this Nation; the Glory of God Almighty; the good of his holy Catholick Church; the Salvation of the Souls of men; and the reducing of the wandring sheep, whether Popish, or other Dissenters, into Uniformity; which is heartily desired by
