SIRS,
THough I must needs con∣fess that I have an oc∣cult Antipathy against nothing more than Prin∣ting of SERMONS; since I have observed how subject they are to be censured, either as not seasoned, or not seasonable: yet I am so very sensible how deeply I stand engaged to
you, for your many and singular civi∣lities to me, that I cannot (with any shew of gratitude, and good manners) any longer withstand the repeated En∣treaties, or rather Commands, of so many worthy Masters of the Bench of both Societies, who (as hearty Lovers of the King.) have joinctly, and seve∣rally importun'd me to publish this Ser∣mon; the cheif scope whereof is to prevent all future miscarriages, and mischeifs, by truely and plainly informing the Peo∣ple in general, of their bounden Duty by the Law of God, and this Land, in the no less weighty, than necessary, Point of their Allegiance to the Lord's An∣noincted. And as this single Motive revail'd with me for this Publication, mgre all my former prejudice, and resolution against it: so I know not how
to play this after-game better, than by laying hold of this unexpected opportu∣nity, to testifie to the world my real thankfulness (next to Divine Provi∣dence) unto you, both for your unanimous election of me to read a Divinity Le∣cture among you; and also for your noble, free, and unwearied assistance to recover my Right, out of which the iniquity of the late troublesome times, in which there was no King in this our Israel, had forced me by a Sequestration of almost Twenty years standing: During which Inter-regnum Almighty God had a Controversy with this Nation, for our Ingratitude, Schism, Sedition, and Rebellion; which he severely punished by sheathing that Sword in our own Bowels, that was so causelesly, and unlawfully, drawn against his Annoin∣cted;
and making us Captives in our own Land; yea, we were Slaves, to the worst of Conquerors, even our own Lusts. We had then no Law, but Violence; and they that usurped the Power, made it a Capital crime to be found Loyal; against whom they disputed more in Mood, than in Figure; and their only Arguments to refute us, were Commitments, Arraignments, and such Axes, and Halters, as were taken out of the Hang-man's Armory: as St. Hierom reports of their Progenitors, (the Persecutors of the Primitive Christians) Ex officina carnificis, &c. So that then (with the Jews by the Rivers of Babylon) we had cause enough to sit down and weep, when we remembred this our Sion. And since, up∣on our Repentance, God hath been
graciously pleased not only to deliver us out of the House of Bondage, and to wipe all Tears from our Eyes, but also to fill our hearts with joy and gladness: Oh let us never forget to praise, and magnifie, his Mercy (even to a Mira∣cle) wrought in the thrice happy Restauration of His Sacred Majesty to His just Rights; and in the sweet Conjunction of Truth, Peace, and Piety, both in Church and Kingdom. In the secure settlement whereof, as your well known Ability, and approved Integrity, made you eminently instrumental: so it shall ever be his hearty Prayer for the continuance, and enlargement of God's special blessing upon your most Loyal, and every way Laudable Societies, who is
