IT is now (Syr) long time since I not onely desi∣red but fully de¦termined, to te∣stifie the ac∣knowledgement of my dutie to∣wardes you, by some peece of my trauell, in this present kinde of ex∣ercise. The bringing whereof to passe, although I haue oftē sought by perusing many bookes: yet could
 I not light vpō any to answere my contentment (which stood alwayes on the choyce of some such matter, as J thought myght best like you) vntil there chanced into my hands this little frenche aduertisement: The which I had no soner read o∣uer, but by and by there was kind∣led in me a certaine desirousnesse to take it in hād, partly for the ar∣gumēt therof, which caryeth great cause of likelyhoode to please the reader in generall: but chiefly for my perticular purpose to delight you, whom I know to haue a special inclination to heare and reade the
 discourses of the frenche affayres, bycause you youre selfe in youre yong dais, hauing serued the kings Grandfather Francis of Valoys, in his Courte, and trauayled that countrey, haue had good occasion to be acquainted with the customs thereof, and with the nature of the people there. And I doubte not but it will like you so much the better, for the varietie of foraine histories, applyed most aptly to the groūd of the present mater, wher∣with it is, I say not poudered or fil∣led, but fraughted. Neuerthe∣lesse, althoughe my liking of the
 worke did hale forward my labour to the translating thereof: yet I must needes say, that after I was somewhat entred thereinto, strait∣wayes there stoode vp such a num∣ber of doubts, and so huge a heape of imperfections to withstand me, as had not my desire to pleasure you preuayled againste all those stoppes and stayes: my trauell and deuotion therein had lyen in the dust, before my race had halfe bin runne. But yet notwithstandyng, the reasons aforesayd, and the de∣sire I had to do the thing, and the delight I tooke in doing it, wrought
 such persuasion and incouragemēt in me, and did so keepe me still in breath, as I neuer gaue it ouer, till J had turned it into Englishe, in suche sorte, as you my good fa∣ther, may nowe vouchesafe to see: to whome, J moste humbly present it as a newyeeres gift. Therewith∣all hartely wishing, that your ear∣nest zeale towardes all wise, wor∣thy, and vertuous proceedynges, (whereof neerenesse in bloud for∣biddeth me to speak according ei∣ther to your desert, or to my know∣ledge, desire, and duetie) may en∣crease, to Gods glory & the profit
 of your countrey. And the same God prosper you and all youre do∣inges, and blesse you with manye moe newe yeeres, to the conten∣tation of your owne harts desire.
