My Noble Lord,
IT would not a little conduce to the happinesse of our lives, if our thoughts (which are the immedite and to oft abortive issue of our minds) were right∣ly employed and improved: then are they well imployed, when they are conversant about the most excellent object: when they are taken up with the con∣templation of the wisedome, power, providence, justice, holines, and other excellent attributes of him who is excellency it selfe; in the fruition of whom is our highest felicity: this made the sweet Singer of Israel to say, How precious are thy thoughts to me, O God, how great is the summe of them? Psa. 139. As if he had said, the thoughts of thy wisdome, and wonderfull workings of thy providence (things which before he had mentio∣ned) are of great price and worth, being things of incomprehen∣sible excellency: yea, they are as rare as precious, the minds of most men being so seldom taken up with them. I am bold to pre∣sent to your Lordship this small Treatise, that it might give you occasion to entertain such thoughts as these, as also that it might be a testimony of my thankefull acknowledgement of all that ho∣norable respect I have received from you. Thus humbly imploring the Father of mercies, that he would farther enrich you with the true treasure, & inable you inwardly with the graces of his spi∣rit proportionably to those outward endowments wherewith he hath been pleased to dignifie you; I resign you to his mercy & rest
