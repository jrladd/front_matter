Right Noble and Right Honorable LORD,
SInce our worthy and loving Country know no fruitfuller tillage than to till the Sea diligently; by which we see continualy our ware-houses filled with all sorts of the most needful and most pretious Commodities in the world, which by our Ships and sailers trading, are brought superfluously to us out of all Countries and Kingdoms; diverse persons have endeavoured from time to time, to produce to that intent good and convenient Sea-books. By this the sailer is guided and warned, to shun prudently all Rocks, Sands, Shelfs, Whirl-streams and more such like dangers, whereas the Seas and whirl-winds in the meantime threaten and sometimes overcome them yet with many other difficulties. The experience (when Sailers and Pilots many ages have been forced to take care continually with the plum∣met in hand) is come so far at last, that they have discovered lurking deceits of grounds nearer and nearer, that a many before us therefore have been able to set forth divers good books: but being such books can never be without some fault, we have been very willing to bestow our endeavour, trouble, care and charges, to mend all the faults in such books, by certain and true observations of diverse renowned Pilots exactly searched out. Chiefly where the time and the streams often change the depthes and shelves, so that one may not safely trust to the old books. We can assure all Gentlemen, Merchants and Sailers, that this our present work is more exact and more perfect than any yet extant, as it clearly will befound out by skilful Pilots. Thus we take here the boldness to Dedicate this same very Reverently and serviceably to your honour; where we see dayly with great satisfaction and thankfulness, what care you always take, for the Common welfare of our Country, this very magnificent and pourful city the ware-house for the whole world is come to such hight by the navigation traffick, and maintained in it yet by the same with unfatigable deligence, and careful wise Contrivance of the very laudable regency; being hope flattereth us with trusting that this work (tending chiefly to the Common welfare) will be accepted of your honour with a bountiful eye. If I may enjoy so much hap∣piness, I will acknowledge me so much the more obliged, to pray with all my heart continuely to the almighty, (as your noble blood now almost hereditarily possesseth the high and Burgermasterly authority in this mighty city; and your honour enjoyeth for the present the Burgermastership the sixth time with Renown and glory) that it may be his holy pleasure, further in the future to let your honour enjoy the same worthy office and great Authority, several times for many years in full health, luck and satisfaction for the best of this city and estate, and that we may live merry, long quiet and well satisfied under such a Government, since we take the ho∣nour to call us selves
Right Noble and Right Honorable LORD, 
At Amsterdam, the 25th. of July, 1682.
