IF benefites bounti∣fullye beestowed, may whet dulled senses, or taste of receaued curte∣sies, spurre the cowarde Knight to hazard him selfe: I haue good cause & occasion to venture the reproch of people, rather than to suffer so lyberall a Micenas to lose deserued fame, or my selfe to bee spotted with ingratitude, the Mother of vices: which the Romanes so spited and enuied at, that they atta∣ched therwith, were as fellones fully exe∣cuted to death. Supposinge therfore, it to bee least approchfull, to set foorth to the gaze of people my ignorance, and to par∣ticipate with the world my silly sentences: than that, my ingratefull acceptions of your liberalitie, should either impaire so
laudable a qualitie, grafted in your mind, or stop the same to my Successors. Wher∣fore, though that your Worships children bee so vertuously trayned vp, that they neede not the instructions of so base a Booke: yet J hope it may reclayme the rude rablement of people, to lead a better & more lawdable lot of life. Whose re∣conciliacion to Vertue, can not bee, with out your condigne praise, that disdayned not to patronise my trauell, tendring the same. Which though grosely fumbled vp, yet your curtesie is such: that you wil con∣sider of my meaninge, and weye good will more than this papers Pamphlet, decla∣ringe the same. Alexander Kinge of Macedonia did not weye the cup of wa∣ter which Synaetes imparted vpon him, but his good wil, so J trust my pretence wil bee accepted more than the thing J greete you with all. And therupon I commit you to Gods good gouernment.
