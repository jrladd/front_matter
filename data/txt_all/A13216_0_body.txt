Right worthie of Renowne,
THIS is a Piece which craves your Patronage. It con∣taines nothing but what is just and honest; and yet is like enough to meet with such as shall oppose it: For I both know
and finde it true by experience, that hee who sides not with the humours of the common multitude, incurres the odium of not a few. And indeed my comfort is, 'twas alwaies so: Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit. That great Apostle could have said as much;Galae. 4.15.16. for whereas he remembers the good will that the Galatians once bore towards him, he findes the case quite alte∣red, and is now become their enemie, be∣cause he telleth them what is truth: Not that he ever taught them other, but be∣cause hee presseth the more earnestly, where he fears or findes their reluctation. They had (as well appeareth) a minde to go astray; and he not yeelding to them, but directing otherwise, is slighted for his labour. But if it be good (as he also spea∣keth) to be zealously affected alwaies in a good thing; 'tis fit that men submit and learne with patience, till they come to the knowledge of what is good; otherwise their zeale cannot but be preposterous, and violent passions take place of true and
righteous informations. This is that which I only ayme at, a rectifying of such as walke amisse: and if herein my poore endeavours may but finde a curteous ac∣ceptation, I account my paines as much as nothing; being alwaies willing to pro∣mote what I can, the happie prosperitie both of the Church and State. When therefore this Booke which I now send abroad, shall be so happie as to kisse any of your hands; be pleased to shelter it under the zealous wings of your favou∣rable protection. And so praying God to blesse you alwaies; I rest devoted to do you the best service that I can,
