THAT I haue adventured in these vnfaithfull times, so full of suspition and danger, to passe (without leaue) your guardes, and to presse into your Presence, I most humbly craue pardon, having I confesse no other excuse
 not vnmindfull of a Matchiavillian andDivide, et Impera. old Maxime; But I trust Almighty God (as hee hath already begun) will open the eyes of all Christian Kinges and Prin∣ces, in time not onely to prie into, but ef∣fectually to oppose, these his immense and ambitious designes, which else in time may fall heauie vpon our children and posteritie, I end; humbly beseeching the King of Kings and Kingdomes, the Almighty Lord of Hoastes: Most High, Most Illustrious Princes, to protect the persons of your selues and children, with his grace to multiplie your Honors and Dignities, foure-fold to restore your e∣states, and after many yeares to crowne you in Heaven, with the Diademes of Glorie and endles happines.
