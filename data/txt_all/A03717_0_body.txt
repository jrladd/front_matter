IT were a shame (Right Hono∣rable) our li∣bertie should be now to learne, what the Iewes captiuitie was long agoe taught, that the publike in∣ferres the priuate benefit; In the
peace of the Citie shall yee haue peace. A sufficient Apologie for this bold aduenture of presenting some parts of my poore indeuours, before a∣ny merit hath recommended my per∣son to your Lordships knowledge. For I feele my selfe no senselesse member of those bodies, which out of diuers ex∣periences challenge an interest in your Honours most fauourable protection. And could I collect all those graue iudgements and decrees, which your Honours learned integritie hath af∣forded vnto Churches, Colledges, and other Incorporations for charitable vses; I doubt not, but posteritie would equall them with many new erections and foundations. Accept then (Right Noble Lord) these few notes of a Scholars obseruation, who desires not
so much to make himselfe knowne, as to acknowledge his portion of the Churches and that Vniuersities dutie, whereof your Honour is a blessed Pa∣trone. God remember your Honour according to that which you haue done for both.
