RIght Honorable, hauing no meanes at all to make knowne the humble affection I beare vnto your good Ladyship, but in putting the patronizing of this my poore paines vpon your Honour: hoping first, for the tender loue you boare to the Delia of my sor∣rowing, you will deigne both to looke ouer it, & fauour it: next, for the hartie loue (in no little hono. kindnesse) your La. boare to your humble Seruant my late Vncle Marm. Newton; who in the bitter paines of his death, dis∣cours'd the bountifull affection your La. boare vnto him, and what losse he had sustaind in loosing so good a La. and Mistris: which corsite inwardly so greeued him, that he grew weerie of the World, lamenting to his last gaspe, that he had not time to preferre me to your Ladiships fauour, that his former loue towards you, and your three honourable Daughters, dying in him, might liue in mee. And thus hoping that with the remembrance of both, your Ladiship will deigne to accept my paines to your fauour, in the amplest hope of my desire.
