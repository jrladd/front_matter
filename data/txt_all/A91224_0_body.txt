SIR, Your great Favour and Huma∣nity
To Me whiles Exile, Prisner in Jersy,
Wholy secluded from all Friends ac∣cesse,
Under the angry Frownes of their Greatnesse
Who sent Me thither, to deprive me quite
Of worldly Comforts; challenge a just Right
To these rude Meditations, which there grew,
And so in Justice are your proper Due.
Accept them than, as a small Pledge of my
Thankes unto You, till Oportunity
And better Dayes, enable me to finde,
Some other meanes to pay all that's behinde.
