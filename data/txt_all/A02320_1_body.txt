MY LORD,
I Here present you Mounsieur Bal∣zac's Letters, which may well bee tearmed new ones, euen after the eighth Edition; for though they haue long since beene in possession of pub∣like fauour, yet may I iustly say, this is the first time their Authour hath auouched them. The aduantagious iudgement you haue deliuered of him, and the ardor wherewith all France hath followed your approbation, well deserueth his best endeauours toward the perfectionating so excellent things: I haue beene solicitous to draw him to this la∣bour, to the end the world might know, that if I bee not worthy the share I haue in his respects, yet that I haue at least beene wise enough to make right vse of my good fortune, and to cause it to become seruiceable to the glory of my Countrey. But truely, were hee master of his body, or did his maladies afford him liberty of spirit, hee would not suffer any but himselfe to speake in this cause; and

his Pen performing no slight acts, would haue consecrated his owne labours, and the wonders they haue produced. But since euills haue no prefixed time of durance, and in that all the good interims which hereafter may befall him, are wholly to be imployed in his Booke, The Prince; I esteemed it to small purpose to attend his health in this businesse, and that it was now no longer any time to deferre the purging of these curious Letters, from such blemishes as ill impressions had left▪ vpon them. They shall therefore now appeare in the parity wherein they were conceiued, and with all their naturall ornaments: Besides, I haue added diuers letters of his, not as yet come to light, which may serue as a subiect of greater sa∣tisfaction to all men, and bee as a recompense of the ho∣nour wherewith he hath collected the former. And truly (my Lord) had it beene possible to place in the Fron∣tispiece of this Booke, a more illustrious name then yours, or should Mounsieur de Balzac's incsination▪ and mine haue beene farre from any such intention, yet would not the order of things, or the law of decency haue permitted any other reflection, then what I now make: I speake not at this present, of that dazeling greatnesse whereunto you are eleuated, nor of that so rare and necessary vertue, which rightly to recognize, the greatest King on earth hath esteemed himselfe not to bee ouer able. I will onely say, I had reason to submit an eloquence produced in the shade, and formed in solitarinesse, to this other eloquence quickned both with voyce and action, causing you to reigne in soueraignety at all assemblies. Certainely (my Lord) you are more powerfull by this incomparable quality, then by the authority wherein the King hath

placed you: The onely accent of your voyce hath a hidden property, to charme all such as hearken vnto you; none can bee possessed with any so willfull passions, who will not be appeased by the reasons you propound; and after you haue spoken, you will at all times remaine master of that part of man, no way subiect to the worlds order, and which hath not any dependency vpon lawfull power, or tyranni∣call vsurpation. This is a trueth (my Lord) as well knowne as your name, and which you so solidly confirmed at the last assembly of the Notables; as that in the great diuersity of humours and iudgements, whereof it was composed, there was peraduenture this onely point well resolued on, That you are the most eloquent man liuing. This being true, I can no way doubt, but the perusall of this Booke I offer vnto you, will extraordina∣rily content you, and that you will bee well pleased to re∣tire thither, sometimes to recreate your spirits after agitation, and to suspend those great thoughts, who haue for their obiect the good of all Europe. It is a Booke (my Lord) wherein you shall find no common thing but the Title; (where entertaining some particular person) Mounsieur de Balzac reades Lessons to all men; and where amidst the beauty of Complements and dexterity of Ieasting, he often teacheth of the most sublime points of Philosophy: I meane not that wrangling part thereof which reiecteth necessary verities, to seeke after vnprofi∣table ones, which cannot exercise the vnder standing with∣out prouoking passions, nor speake of moderation with∣out distemper, and putting the soule into disorder: But of that, whereby Pericles heretofore made himselfe ma∣ster of Athens, and wherewith Epaminondas raised

himselfe to the prime place of Greece: which tempereth the manners of particulars, regulateth the obligation of Princes, and necessarily bringeth with it the felicity of all States where they command. This booke will make it apparent euen to your enemies, that your life hath beene at all times equally admirable, though not alwayes alike glorious: How you haue conserued the opinion of your vertue, euen in the time of your hardest fortunes, and how in the greatest fury of the tempest, and in the most extreame violence of your affaires, the integrity of your actions hath neuer beene reduced to the onely testi∣mony of your conscience. To conclude, It is in this Booke (my Lord) where I suppose you will bee well plea∣sed to reade the presages of your present greatnesse, and what hath beene foretold; not by Astrologicall rules, or the aspect of some Constellation, but by a true discourse founded vpon the maximes of reason, and experience of things past; causing him to presume, that God hath not conferred such extraordinary endowments vpon you, to be for euer encloistered within your selfe: And that he hath loued France better, then to depriue her of the good you ought to procure her. But all these verities shall one day be comprised in that worke the King, by your mouth, (my Lord) hath commanded Mounsieur de Balzac to vndertake, and which one yeere of leisure will effect. There shall it be, where he will cause all men to confesse, that to haue the pourtraict of a perfect Prince, the reigne of so great a Monarch as ours▪ is to bee attended; that the Diuine Prouidence neuer shewed it selfe more ap∣parantly, then in the conduct of his designes, and in the euent of his enterprises; and how Heauen hath so farre

declared it selfe in his fauour, that were his state assaul∣ted on all sides, and all ordinary meanes of defence should faile him; he hath vertue sufficient to saue himselfe, and performe miracles. Now as you are the prime intelli∣gence of his Councill, and your cogitations the first cau∣ses of the good resolutions therein taken, you are not to doubt (my Lord) but you likewise possesse the princi∣pall place therein, after His Maiestie; and that you participate more then any other of His triumphs. There shall you be reuenged of all those wretched writings you haue formerly slighted: There the spirits of all men shall bee satisfied in the iustice of your deportments, and ca∣lumny it selfe will there bee so powerfully conuinced, that to cry downe so legall a gouernement as yours, ill af∣fected French-men, and those strangers enemies to this Crowne, will finde no further pretext in affaires, nor credulity among men. And truely, when I (on the one side) consider how fat all it is to those who gouerne, to be exposed to the enuy of great ones, and complaints of meaner persons, and how Publike affaires haue this fa∣tality, as how pure soeuer the administration thereof be, they still afford sufficient colour to calumny, to disguise them and cause them to appeare iniust. And on the other side, when I consider that to guide this State is no lesse then to manage a body hauing no one sound part; and how there is no sicke person who doeth not sometimes murmure against his Phisitian; I dare bee confident (my Lord) that such a man as Mounsieur de Balzac will not prooue vnusefull vnto you, and that the lustre of your actions, and glory of your life shall receiue no diminution in his hands. I would say more, did I not

feare to disoblige him in commending him, or if I belee∣ued him to be so great a selfe admirer as his enemies figure him vnto vs. But I who haue sufficiently studied him to know him▪ and who am acquainted with his most secret Inclinations, and the most particular conception▪s he hath in his soule, and of a farre different opinion to theirs. I will therefore rest there (my Lord) and not to cause you to loose more time, and to the end you may the sooner inioy the entertainement, this excellent Booke prepareth for you: I will satisfie my selfe in letting you know, that I esteeme not my selfe so vnfortunate as for∣merly I did, since I haue happened vpon so faire an occasion, to let you know that I am,
My Lord,
