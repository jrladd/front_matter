SIR,
THe Prodigal, upon his Return, with great Reason pays his Respects to You, who was Privy to his Departure, (if probably this seem Aenigmatical to the Reader, I ask his Pardon, 'tis enough your self takes my Meaning.) This Person, were be not hugely sensible of your kind Complacency, would still appear as true a Prodigal as ever. In the agitation of Spirit, and search of thought, among many motives for this his Revisitation, he cou'd not determine on a more powerful and prevailing inducement, than the shelter he hopes to find under your

Roof, from the storms and injuries of Cri∣tical Fortune. You, whose worthy Temper, Ingenuity, and good Humour, (not to open into the Field of your excelling Justice, Integrity, and other numerous Virtues,) delights not in Satyrical Reflexions, or ill-natur'd Cavils; but whose Mind is constantly exercised in amicable Offices, in friendly offers, and as friendly acceptations of well-meant appli∣cations to you of any sort; not unlike the great Augustus Caesar, who never dis∣missed any person Discontented or Disob∣liged.
Your innate Charity to all in general, and more especially to this relenting Penitent, he assures himself, is so tender of his well∣fare, that you will Indulge him, if it be but for fear he should grow desperate, and Re∣lapse, and so his last Aberrations, and State, should prove far worse than the first.
He believes he need say no more on his

own behalf, presuming on your mighty Good∣ness; only this he begs leave to super-add, — That in the declension of his late Meridian Splendor, he, having met with a Person that was immers'd in much the same Ill-circum∣stances with his unfortunate Self, takes the confidence to bring him with him upon the same account of Respect and Homage; well-hoping your inexhausted Generosity, will not refuse to extend your Smiles to him likewise: he goes by the Name of Penseroso.
The Prodigal has not kept so much Com∣pany to be ignorant of, or defective in good Manners; nor has lost his Breeding, together with his Fortunes; but still retains a fit proportion. In Civility therefore to this Friend, a Stranger, he puts him in before him, thus to kiss your hands;
