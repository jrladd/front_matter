MAdame, I present vn∣to your La∣diships view and reading, this Homelie preached in the
 French tongue by that lear∣ned and iudicious diuine, Mr. Peter du Moulin, Mi∣nister of the word of God, and by me translated, touch∣ing that excellent conference betweene God and his ser∣uant Abraham; wherein we may behold on the one side the nature of sinne, and the vengeance of God when sinners are come to their full measure; on the other side the patience and famili∣ar accesse, which he affords to those that loue him, how milde and patient he is to∣wards them that feare him, and how hee behaues him∣selfe towards his enemies,
 and all to this end to moue vs all to faith, repentance, and humility.
And sithence my small paines in englishing it yeelds me a right to make choyce of one to whom I may dedicate this little volume, I am bold to present the same vnto your Ladiship (hoping your fauourable acceptance ther∣of) and the rather because it befits you, (Madame) in many respects, for these vertues that are here re∣quired, are in you. (Ma∣dame) I speake it without flattery; faith, repentance, humility, zeale to Gods house, loue to his word, loue
 and faith which you haue to the Lord Iesus, and towards all his Saints; for you are an Anna, alwayes seruing God in the Temple with fa∣sting and prayers, a Lydia in hearing Gods word, a Mary in pondering and meditating the same, a Dor∣cas to Widdowes and Or∣phans, a Shunamite to the Prophets and Ministers of God, not onely countenan∣cing our persons and mini∣stery with your person and presence in our Church of Canterbury when you are here, but also cherishing vs with good and comfortable words, and exercising your
 liberall charitie towards our poore, not leesing your first loue, like the Ephesians, but continuing it towards vs frō time to time; and therefore the iust God will not forget your piety towards him, nor your charity towards his Saints; but as your name and charitable workes are inregistred in our booke of remembrance, so is your name written in the Booke of Life, your deeds of cha∣rity in feeding, couering, visiting the poore, written in that Booke that shall be opened in the day of iudge∣ment to your consolation; then shall you reape plenti∣fully
 what you sowe here, and as Damascen speakes, here you giue a little, there you shall receiue much; now you giue a transitory thing, then shall you gaine an eternall; here you giue a penny, there you shall receiue a King∣dome; for if Iulius Cesar gaue Lands to one that gaue him but a draught of water, what a reward will Christ giue to those, that giue but a cup of water to drinke in his name to those that belong to him? If Darius gaue a Kingdome to Silosontes, that gaue him a garment onely; what a Kingdome will Christ giue to those that
 giue him cloathing, foode, and drinke, in the name and person of the least and poo∣rest of his brethren? The same Iesus Christ whom you feede, cloath, and visite here on earth in his members; as he feedes you and cloathes you here on earth, not onely corporally, but also spiritu∣ally, with the spirituall Manna the bread and wa∣ter of life, euen he himselfe who is your spirituall foode and garment also, will giue you that euerlasting King∣dome, prepared for you from the foundation of the world; where and when you shall be crowned with the crowne
 of righteousnesse, cloathed with the roabes of glory, sit downe with Abraham, Isa∣ack and Iacob to be nouri∣shed with the fruit of the tree of life and water of life, and liue eternally with him in the kingdome of heauen, Amen.
Canterbury the 30. of Iune, 1620.
