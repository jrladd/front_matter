Chrysost. in Rom. hom. 19. Fratres in seculo; fratres in Domino; quae posterior major est & melior fraternitas: uti Autor Ambr. nom. Serm. 9. & 79. Aug. de verb.

The maine subject Matter of it is nothing in effect, but a Motive or incite∣ment unto that, which it standeth us all upon, in the first place, and with our best care and endevour, as well to seeke after, as to seeke into: To seek into, that wee may know it, and learne it; to seeke after, that wee may be possessed and seized of it. Since it is that alone whereinPsal. 84.4, 5, 10, 11, 12. Matth 5.3. Luke 14.15. & 22.29, 30. Act. 20.6. &. 22.7.

That wee may therefore know and understand what it is, wherein it consisteth, and by what meanes it may be attained (andPraeparatio enim ro∣rum cognitio est, Bern. ibid. till wee be thus acquainted with it, wee can never come to be possessed of it) wee must make
 diligent, Ioh. 5.39. search and enquirie into Gods Word, for it is that alone that can2 Tim. 3.16, 17.

But becauseArsnulla abs{que} Ma∣gistro discitur, Hieron. ad rustic. no Art is easily without a Teacher attained: and, in this more specially, all1 Cor. 3.7. 1 Iob. 2.20.27.

Hebr. 12.25. his Chaire in Heaven:) so earnest prayer is to be used for a bles∣sing from God on all such our courses and endevours either publike or private, that he will be pleased with his good Spirit to second and assist his owne Ordinances, that there∣byPsal. 119.18. the eyes of our mindes may be opened, andEphes. 1.18. Luke 24.45. our under∣standings so illightned, that wee may be able in some due measure to see and discerne this estate what it is, and to conceive and apprehend the Mysteries appertaining unto it. Againe, because it will little availe us to know it, un∣lesse wee have our share in it, to be well seene in the Sta∣tutes and Ordinances of it, unlesse wee have part in the Im∣munities and Royalties that are therein to be enjoyed: (It is but a double misery for a man to know what is to be had, if he have it not himselfe:) Our next endevour therefore must be (for the effecting whereof alsoPsal. 86.11. & 119.33, 34, 35, 36. Ephes. 3.14— 19. the assistance of Gods Spirit is humbly and instantly to be craved) to have that which wee have learned, or doe learne, out of Gods word, concerning this Royall and blessed estate, to be effectu∣allyIam. 1.21, 22. 1 Pet. 1.23. wrought into us: (and indeed till it be so wrought into us, it isIoh. 6.45. Ephes. 4, 20, 21, 22, 23. Vide not. Bez. ibid. 1 Ioh. 2.3, 4. & 4.7, 8. never truly, soundly, or effectually learned of us:)
 That is, wee must strive and labour to have true faith, repen∣tance, and other spirituall graces surelyIames 2.21. Ephes. 3.. setled in our soules; whereby wee may both have a right and title to this King∣dome, and be in some good sort and measure also possessed and seized of it. The rather since thatApoc. 20.6. Matth. 19.2 Iohn 3.3, 5. after this life none shall partake in it, but those only that in some degree or o∣ther were possessed of it, while they lived here. As it is with us therefore in regard of worldly possessions: so should it be in regard of this heavenly Inheritance. For worldly possessions, wee will get, if wee can, a title to them; when wee have it, wee will be sure that our title be good, and use all meanes to make it sure: and when wee have so done, wee are not yet then at rest neither; wee cannot bee quiet, till wee be seized and possessed of it, yea till wee be in an absolute, quiet, and peaceable possession, not of some part of it, but of the whole. In like manner should it be with us for thisHebr. 3.1. 1 Pet. 1.4. heavenly Inheritance: wee must first la∣bour to get a, Ius, Bez. Iohn 1.12. right and title unto it: which byIbidem. faith must be procured: for it is that alone on our part, that byRom. 3.23, 24, 28. & 5.1, 2. Ju∣stification and freeGalat. 3.26. Adoption giveth us a title thereunto. In the next place wee must endevour to get some2 Pet. 1.10. good assu∣rance that this our title to it is good: that which must by the2 Cor. 13.5. triall of our faith be effected: ForSee the Signes of Sinceritie on Psal. 97.1. (to omit, that by seeming titles many oft are deluded) though our title to it be never so good, yet wee may not be aware of it, and so misse may wee of much comfort, untill wee have taken some due triall of it. And lastly, wee must strive and con∣tend to get our selves more and more possessed of it: which must be done2 Pet. 1.4.—8. by the2 Tim. 1.6. exercise andLuke 17.5. 1 Thess. 4.1, 10. growth of our faith, and other the graces of God in us, and by1 Thess. 5.19, 20. a constant usage of all good meanes whereby the same may be2 Pet. 2.1, 2. nourished,Ephes. 3.16. corroborated, andEphes. 4.15, 16. increased. ForRom. 6.6.14. Col. 3.5, 8, 9, 10. the more spirituall grace spreadeth and groweth powerfull in us, the more ground get wee of our corrupt nature: AndRom. 6.11, 12. the more conquest wee make of this our inward corruption, the further proceed wee in possession of this ourEphes. 2.5, 6. Philip. 3.20. heavenly Inheritance. Now be∣cause so long as wee live here inPhilip. 3.12. an estate of Imperfection, (forPhilip. 3.13. 1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 11. no perfection is to be had, or to be hoped for of us while wee are here) wee can never fully be acquainted with the Rules and Rights of this Kingdome, or the parts and par∣cels
 of this Inheritance: For so long as1 Cor. 13.9, 11. wee know these, as1 Cor. 8.1, 2. all other things, but in part,Maxima pars eorum quae scimus, est minima eorum quae ignoramus. Aug. wee cannot but of some part of them remaine ignorant still: Nor can wee attaine to such a full and plenary assurance of our right to it, but that some doubt and scruple about it will be sometime troubling us: For since that as our other parts, soMatth. 6.30. & 8.26. & 14.31. & 16.8. Luke 17.3, 4. our faith also is imper∣fect; and our notice of it as weake ordinarily, as our faith it selfe is; and that where faith is so imperfect, there must needs be someMark. 9.24. Idem simul, qui nondum per∣fectè crediderat, & credebat, & incredu∣lus erat; Greg. in E∣zech. 15. infidelity more or lesse mixt with it; it can hardly be avoyded but that someFides vera cum du∣bietatis aura, Idem Mor. l. 10. c. 8. wavering should be: e∣specially considering that we have to deale with a most wi∣ly Adversary, that is wont oft to be questioning of this our right and title, & by many subtill quirkes, and fallacies, and colourable pretences, endevouring to shake this our assurance: And much lesse can wee attaine to any full and absolute, (while butRom. 8.23. & 7.25. in part as yet wee are sanctified, and butRom. 5.2. & 8.24. in hope only glorified;) yea or quiet and peaceable possession of it;Rom. 7.17, 20. the enemy being & abiding yet within our gates, andRom. 7.23. Gal. 5.17. daily working our disturbance: For this cause therefore, and in regard hereof, is our Seeking of this Kingdome, not to be pra∣ctised for a spurt, or taken up for some time, and then to be let fall and laid downe againe, as if no further need were of it, butPsalm. 24.6. & 27.8. & 105.3, 4. last it must, & continueApoc. 2.10, 26. so long as this life lasteth. StillProv. 2.3, 4. Rom 12.2. searching wee must be into it, that wee may2 Pet. 3.18. grow better acquainted with it: and stillApoc. 3.2. strengthning our assurance, that we may takeApoc. 3.10, 11, 12. 2 Thess. 2.15. faster hold of it: and still striving toPhil. 1.9, 10, 11. 2 Pet. 3.18. grow in grace, that wee may2 Pet. 1.11. get further possession of it: And a principall part must it be of our daily Prayer, thatMatth. 6.10. This Kingdome may come; that not only it mayLuk. 17.21. Vt in nos veniat, Ambr. Di∣on. de Sacr. l. 5. c. 4. Et in nobis maneat, Tertul. ad Marc. l. 4. come into us to take possession of us, but thatMatth. 25.34. Ne forte veniat, & nobis non veniat. Multis e∣nim non est obventu∣rum, quod est tamen venturum, Aug. hom. 42. we may come at length also to a full fruition of it,1 Pet. 1.9. attaining to theRom. 8.22. end of our faith, and hope, and sanctification, the eternall2 Thess. 2.13. salvation of our soules andRom. 8.23, 24. Phil. 3 21. bodies. This is the course that in this discourse you are en∣cited unto; which I doubt not but that you have also made both an happy entrance into, yea and good progresse in al∣ready: yet if any spurre may be found therein, that may helpe to prick you on (or any of you, or any other that have more need than you) to a more eager, Phil. 3.13, 14. pursuing, put∣ting on, and pressing hard (with the Apostle) to the marke-ward, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus;
 or if any rub may thereby be removed, that either hath been, or hereafter may be cast into your way, either by the World, orIoh. 12.31. & 16.11. the Prince of it, or any homebred confederate of his, whereby you might bee (as the people were by2 Sam. 20.12. Amasa's corps) either stayed, or turned aside, or disheartned, or slacked in this your religious course; a plentifull recompence I shall esteeme it of my paines therein taken, and I beseech God to that purpose to give his blessing thereupon. I have unto the Sermon annexed a short Catecheticall Summe, which may help, though not your selves, being now past such helps, yet your younger ones, that are1 Cor. 3.1, 2. Hebr. 5.12, 13. not past the breast yet, (for which sort in mine owne Family at first I contri∣ved it;) in the enquiry after, and discovery of the way to this Kingdome: wherein from the grounds of sacred Scrip∣ture is briefly declared, how at first wee wereConstituti. possessed of it, how wee came to beDestituti. deprived of it, and by what means wee may beRestitui. restored againe to it: As also it may help to fit and prepare them for the participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Commending both to Gods Blessing, and my selfe to your Prayers, I take leave, and rest
