RIght gracious and gracefull Lord, your late imaginary, but now actuall Trauailer, then to most-conceited Uiraginia, now to almost-concealed Uirginia; then a light, but not lewde, now a sage and allowed translator; then of a scarce knowne nouice, now a fa∣mous Father; then of a deuised Country scarse on earth, now of a desired Citie sure in heauen; then of Utopia, now of Eutopia; not as by testament, but as a te∣stimonie of gratitude, obseruance, and hearts-honour to your Honor, bequeathed at hence-parting (thereby scarse perfecting) this his translation at the imprinting to your Lordships protecting. He, that against detrac∣tion beyond expectation, then found your sweete pa∣tronage in a matter of small moment, without distrust or disturbance in this worke of more worth, more weight, as he approoued his more abilitie, so would not but expect your Honours more acceptance.
Though these be Church-men, and this a Church-matter, he vnapt, or vnworthy to holde trafique with either;

yet heere Saint Augustine, and his Commenter Uiues; most fauour of the secular: and the one accordingly to Marcellinus, the other to our King Henry, directed their dedications; and as translators are onely tyed, to haue, and giue, true vnderstanding: so are they freer then the authors to sute them-selues a Patrone. Which as to Scipio, the staffe and stay, the type and top of that Cornelian stemme, in quam, vt plura genera in vnam arborem, videtur insita multorum illuminata sapientia, your . in Br. poore Pacuuius, Terence, or Ennius, (or what you list, so he be yours) thought most conuenient to consecrate. VVherefore his legacie laide at your Honours feete, is rather here deliuered to your Honours humbly thrise-kissed hands by his poore delegate.
