GRatious and dread Soueraigne,
I say the truth, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witnes in the Holy-ghost, that I haue with the Apostle great heauinesse, and continuall sorrow in my heart for many of my brethren and Country-men. And my hearty desire and prayer for them to God, is, that they may be saued. For I beare them recorde, that they haue the zeale of God, though not according to knowledge, which is the onely cause that mooued me to write this short Trea∣tise. And, because God of his great goodnesse hath vouchsafed your tender yeeres the education of TIMOTHIE, and indu∣ed your Highnesse, since your happy gouernement with princely gifts, knowledge to discerne truth, and zeale to maintaine truth, I humbly present vnto your Maiestie, these few lines, containing a subiect of so great importance. The common voyce, and hope
 of your best affected people is, that your Highnesse hath a religi∣ous intent, to make God yet better knowne in IVDA, and his name yet greater in HIERVSALEM, to bring all these your Kingdomes to the acknowledgement and profession of one truth; so that hereafter HIERVSALEM may be as a walled towne and fenced citty, which is at vnitie within it selfe: and as it was in the dayes of the IVDGES, all ISRAEL may be gathered together, as one man, from DAN to BEERSHEBA, vnto the Lord in MISHPAH. The Lord guide and prosper you in all your wayes, the Lord establish your house and kingdome, the Lord blesse you out of SION, that you may see the wealth of HIERVSALEM all the dayes of your life, that you may see your Childrens Children, and peace in SION.
