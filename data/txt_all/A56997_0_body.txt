Most Gracious, and dread-full Soveraign.
THe pretended Parliament of England having their Agents la∣tely in the Low Countries, trea∣ting with the United Provinces about conditions of an offensive and defensive warre, my resolution was to have set out this Remonstrance in the Dutch tongue for the satisfaction of those Provinces; but the treaty ended almost as soone as I began to actuate my resolution: whereupon I altered my purpose, and have now set it out in English for the satisfaction of your owne Subjects, hoping the truth beeing
 here clearly illustrated, may have some effect upon their Consciences, which can not but have great sway over them in ordering and directing their Actions. Experience teacheth that most men act lesse bouldly and resolutely, (especially where their lives must be engaged) when they act against their Conscience, then when they are persuaded of the lawfulnesse and justice of their cause. There hath been more blood spilt by civill warre in your Ma∣jesties dominions within the space of ten yeares, since those pernicious principles touching the Supreamacy of the People and lawfulnesse of resistance have been instilled into mens mindes by some who fetched their doctrine from Hell to furnish the world with tragedies, then formerly in an Hundred. I conceive the nearest and readiest way to reforme such un-christian practices, is to reforme the Conscience, although I deny not but more sharpe and violent remedies must also be ap∣plyed: for some have lost all sence of Conscience, whome your Majesty, I hope, assisted by the al∣mighty providence of God, shall reforme by the Sworde. This is that which Religion calls for
 at your hands, now oppressed by such a multitud, and confused swarme of Sectaries, that I should thinke it impossible for so many men of severall Religions to live together in unitie, did not the Likenesse of their Nature and Manners reconcile their affections, as much as their diffe∣rences in Religion can alienate and estrainge them. And this is that which all your faithfull Subjects pray for, who desire nothing more then to see your Majesty seated in your Royall Throne, and able to protect them from the insolencies of the Re∣bells, who make their will their law, disposing as freely of mens lives and fortunes, as if they had created them and given them their Beeing.
It is a rule in Opticks, when a darke body is greater then a light to which it is directly opposed, it casteth a shaddow in infinitum: Such a shad∣dow (if the continent were capable of an infinite shaddow) will the darke body of the Rebells cast upon the Kingdome of England, whilst it is inter∣posed between your Majesty and your loyall Sub∣jects, depriving them both of your favourable Aspect, and of your Light and Influence, with∣out
 which they can looke for nothing but a conti∣nuation of their present miseries: for should the Rebells prevaile and prosper in their designes, what else can be expected, but that which is wrested from others by Force and Violence, should be main∣tained by Tyranny and Injustice? But whilst they wade in blood to places of preferment and command, the Lord shal overthrow them in the middest of their course, as he overthrew the Ae∣giptians in the red sea; I usurpe not the name of a Prophet, but I speake as one beleeving God to be a faithfull observer of his promises: He will not alwayes be deafe to the prayers and complaints of those that are oppressed, but send them delive∣rance in his due time, and supply your Majesty with all things necessary both to vindicate your owne Rights, and free your People from their oppression.
