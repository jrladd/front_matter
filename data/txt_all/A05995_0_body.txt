MOst respected Sir, I need not cer∣tifie you bow singular is com∣mendation of greatnesse it is, to haue goodnesse linked with it; whether it be that goodnes which is conuersant in doing kinde of∣fices to the liuing, or to the dead: Nay surely, that good which is stretched forth to the liuing, in some regards is the in∣feriour of the two, as which may eyther in heart or deed be recompenced; but that which is performed toward the deceased, can not at all by him that is not, be known; much lesse can it be any way requited: Onely it re∣maines as an high commendation to the liuing, that they still exercise acts of Loue and goodnesse toward such as are departed this present life. This I speake, Right worshipfull Sir, to prouoke you at this time to vouch∣safe the gracious aspect of your countenance, and your
 worthy Patronage to this ensuing Commentary of a god∣ly learned man, now at rest in the Lord. He was once of the same Colledge where your Worship began to lay the foundation of your owne studies; and was not vnknown to your selfe: In which regards I haue made the bolder with you, in becomming an humble and earnest suiter, that you would be pleased of your goodnes to suffer this Orphane-Treatise to repose it selfe vnder your wings; whereof, if it shall please you, Worthy Sir, (as your many and great affaires will permit,) to reade some passage or place, I doubt not but you shall meet with matters, which at once may both profit and delight you. The Author whilest hee liued, had an indisposition and antipathy to the Presse; but since his death, diuers learned men haue pressed mee, not to conceale some writings of his, which came to my hands; yea, they haue challenged mee, as in∣debted to the Church and common good, touching the publication of this part especially: Accept therefore, I pray you, Right Worshipfull Sir, my tendred duty of Dedicating this worke to your name; which, if it shall please you to doe, I shall rest exceedingly bounden to pray for the continuance and increase of all prosperity to you, from the God who is neuer wanting to honour those who honour him.
