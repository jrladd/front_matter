SYR, I haue recea∣ued the Booke of Bertram, translated into English, re∣printed by Syr Humfrey Linde, with a dedicatory, and a longe Preface before it, and togea∣ther your request to haue my iudgement, aswell concerning the credit of the treatise, as the verity of the Preface. Your sin∣gular affection and manifold curtesies shewed towards me,





ioyned with your so religious loue of the Catholike truth, haue so obliged my selfe and my studyes vnto you, as I may not be backeward in yeelding vnto your so pious and iust re∣quest. For I know your require this Censure not for your own satisfaction (who are better grounded, then to be remoued, or moued with the vanity of such a trifle) but for the more full information of some of your friends, whome Syr Hum∣frey would engage to run the same vnaduised course with himselfe, who dothPraefa. fol. 3. b. lin 21. & fol. 14. b. lin. 16. engage the credit of his Religion, & the surety of his Saluation vpon the worthines of this Tracte. I haue

heerin exceeded the breuity of a Censure, as being desirous to lay open not only the insuffici∣ency of this Preface, to preuent the Readers danger, but also briefly the verity of the Reall-presence, for the Prefacers, by me desired, conuersion vnto the Catholike church. The worke being wholly and total∣ly yours by the free & full gift of the Authour, you may dis∣pose thereof at your pleasure, and if you iudge the same pro∣lixe, you may select such par∣ticles thereof, as you shall e∣steeme most fit to be sent to your friends, and to accept of the whole (as I know you will)

with the same affection as it is offered vnto you by him, who doth euer rest,
