Much Honored Sir,
I should not have
known how to
have skreened
my self from
the imputation
of Overvaluing this Paper, if
I had thought it had merited
your Acceptance, much less
your Patronage: for, in refe∣rence
to the latter, as I esteem
custom no sufficient Warranty,
for men's making the Portal a

guard & defence to the City,
judging themselves sufficient∣ly
secured from those assails
to which they are otherwise
liable and exposed, by place∣ing
some Name of Repute in
the Entry; so I could not but
account it, as highly above the
infirmities as the bulk of this
pamphlet, to deserve the Pas∣port
of your Name standing in
the Front, to induce the world
(which is that I designe in
this Dedication) to be at least
Civill to it: And in reference
to the former, could these
Lines change their hue and
put on Red, they would but
in type represent that Consci∣ousness
of many imperfections
which Guilt hath made legible
in the Authours Countenance:

So that waving all plea of Ti∣tle
by desert, to your accept∣ance
as well as Protection, I
must cast my self entirely up∣on
your Pardon; which I pre∣sume
I shall not be long in
suing out, having anticipated
the severest Award any other
Judge can passe, by a more
rigid Censure of my own,
which I hope will procure fa∣vour
for him, who is
Much Hond. Sir, 
Oxon. Aug. 2d.
1661.
