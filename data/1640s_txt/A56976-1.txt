SWEET LADY,

I Present your faire hands with
this my Enchiridion, to begin a
new Decade of our blest Accompt:
If it adde nothing to your well-instructed
Knowledge, it may bring
somewhat to your well-dispos'd Remembrance:
If either, I have my

end; and you, my endeavour: The
service which I owe, and the affection
which I bear your most incomparable
Parents, challenges the utmost of my
ability; wherein, if I could light you
but the least step towards the happinesse
you ayme at, how happy should I
be? Goe forward in the way which
you have chosen: wherein, if my Hand
cannot lead you, my Heart shall follow
you; and where the weaknesse of my
power shewes defect, there the vigour
of my Will shall make supply.
W
â€¢
oam covetous
of your happinesse
in both Kingdomes
and Worlds.
FRA. QUARLES.
