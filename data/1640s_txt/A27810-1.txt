To the right Reverend, the faithfull Ministers of GODS Word of the Church of Scotland.


RIGHT REVEREND,

IT pleased You in the Generall Assembly last, at Edinburgh, Anno 1647. to take to your consideration, the great utility the Church of GOD may have by the Songs contained in holy Scriptures; After due deliberation, it pleased You to ordain that I should labour in that workâ–ª In obedience unto You, I have endeavoured to come as neer to the Text as was possible for me to do; And those my labours I in all humility

offer to be considered, by the most learned and most judicious Brethren, that the Church having the use thereof, may in obedience to the Apostles precept Ephes. 5. 18. in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs, make melody in their heart to the Lord, whom I intreat in all humility to direct You in all things by his holy Spirit; So I remain

From Glasgow,
the 27 of February, 1648.

Your humble servant in the LORD,
M. ZACHARY BOYD.
