TO THE RIGHT
Honourable Algernon Earle of
Northumberland, Lord Percy, Lucy, Poynings,
Fitzpaine, Brian and Latimer, Lord High Admirall
of England, Knight of the moſt Noble order of
the Garter, and one of his Majeſties
moſt Honourable Privie
Councell.

Right Honourable,


THe unworthy oppreſſed Author
hath not long ſince
groaned under the ſevere
cenſure of the late high
Commiſſion for the enſuing
ſpeculations, which
now he adventures to preſent unto your Honour,
hoping for a candid acceptance, and interpretation
of his poore endeavours for the
good of Zion. Had not the riſing Sunne of
an auſpicious Parliament diſpelled thoſe

clouds of oppreſſion and tyrannie, that menaced
a drowning both to me and them, they
had beene choaked in their embryo, and never
enjoyed the happineſſe they have now attained
in your honourable aſpect. Pardon
(moſt noble Lord) the enforced preſumption
of the diſtreſſed Author, which implores
and hopes for your Honourable Patronage,
and humbly praying for the daily increaſe of
your Honours health and eternall happineſſe,
remaines


Your Honours most humble
moſt devoted ſervant,
William Fenwick.
