TO THE RIGHT NOBLE, AND TRVLY VERTVOVS LADY TEMPERANCE

MOſt vertuous Lady, yea, Vertue it ſelfe, under whoſe protection to endeavour is moſt ſafe: and therefore that is here my moſt humble ſuite. I have, as inſues, taken in hand to inſiſt upon, or rather to deale with moſt peremptory, ſtout, and turbulent Paſſions. My incounter with ſuch, being countenanced by your ſelfe, ſhall minde the more happy ſucceſſe. Which favour, deare Lady,

ſhall for ever prove my incouragement, and approve your courteſie, under the ſhadow of whoſe wing I ſhall be ſheltred as I walke, from all the ſearching heat, of accuſing hatred; iſſuing forth the infernall furnace of detraction.
Thus farre preſuming, it is, doubtleſſe, my duty, to vow you my ſervice: in the performance of which, where I ſhall faile in act, I truſt to fulfill it in deſire, and for ever reſt.


Your Honours to Command, So long as mine owne to obey:
Edward Calver.
