TO THE MOST
EXCELLENT
PRINCE,
CHARLES,
PRINCE
OF WALES,
Heire-Apparent to the
Monarchy of Great
Britaine, &c.

Most Illustrious Sir,


I Doubt not your Closet
already abounds▪
and is daily replenished,
with volumes of

English History, as those
Mirrours, in whose Reflections
your Royall Ancestors,
you may best discover
Theirs, and direct your
owne Actions.
I therefore humbly addresse
this piece to your Highnesse, not as a Booke,
but as an Index, which cannot
offer the Pompe of
•
 a
Volume▪ yet may yeeld the
profit of a Manuall.
The work is Posthumus,
bereav'd both of the Author
and protection; and
had it not desired to live
under the Patronage of so

clement a Prince, was willing
to dye in the Cradle,
rather then be expos'd to
theadventures of a distempered
Age.
I referre its merits to the
judgement of the Publique
(to whose use it affords it
selfe,) but humbly begges,
that being an Orphan, its
Fatherlesse condition may
finde succour and countenance
from the splendour
of your goodnesse, under
which it hath beene first
brought 
•
orth into the
world.
Vouchsafe 
•
 therefore

(Great Prince) to cast a
gracious Eye on this deserted
•
Object,
and the poore
Oblation of

Your most humbly
devoted servant
and Subject
HENRY SEILE.
