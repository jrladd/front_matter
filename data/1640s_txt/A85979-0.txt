TO
THE HONORABLE
HOUSE OF COMMONS,
Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.

HONORABLE SENATORS;


WHen formerly I have been
moved by friends to preach
before you at the Monthly
Faſt, I have alwayes declined
it, and earneſtly intreated
them not to make the motion; being ready
to ſay, as Auſonius to Caeſar in another
caſe, Non habeo ingenium, I have not
parts for ſuch a ſervice in ſuch a Preſence;
or as Moſes anſwered the Lord,Exod 4. 10.
Non ſum

facundus, I am not eloquent; for I never
thought my Oratory worthy ſuch an Auditory:
but when a learned Member of
your Houſe came to me in your name, and
ſignified your will to have it ſo, I could not
ſay as that Poet did,Obſequium

Caeſar ſed juſsit,
habebo, as if he had wit at command, but
the Senate ſending, I reſolved, I muſt obey,
& do as well as I can with Gods aſsiſtance.Lipſ. Ep
Now having in obedience to your Order,
both preached and printed this plain Sermon,
I beſeech you take it with all faults,
and connive. This I may ſay to my comfort,
it was preached in a good day, and we that
then made our Supplications for you, and
with you, found not our prayers and yours
fruitleſs,2 Sam. 23. 10. for the Lord wrought a great
Victory that day;

By Weſtcheſier. a good incouragement to
you to continue your dayes of Humiliation,
of which you find ſo good effects. Often may
you heare ſuch Newes from your Forces,

that we may enjoy the benefit of your Ordinances
in peace.
Worthy Patriots, it was joyfull tidings
to us in all parts of the Kingdome, when we
heard for certain, that there ſhould be a
Parliament, and that Writs were out for
chooſing Knights of the Shire, and it was
an augmentation of our joy, when we heard
of a Triennial Parliament; that I thought
would be fraenum or flagrum to all corrupt
men, but when wee underſtood that
there was an Act for the continuation of this
Parliament, we had greater cauſe of rejoycing,
becauſe by this meanes yee have
opportunity to perfect thoſe things, which
other Parliaments could but propound &
begin, being ſundry times broken up, before
they could do any conſiderable ſervice
for their Countrey. God forbid, that that
high Court which is now eſtabliſhed by a
law, ſhould ever be diſſolved by the ſword.

Peace,
2 Chro. 12. 18.
peace be unto you, and to your
Helpers, your God helpeth you. He
grant, that yee may proſper, and triumph
in his Name and praiſe, untill yee have
finiſhed the worke which he hath given
you to doe, which is and ſhall be the
prayer of

Weſtminſter, 
Octob. 30.

The unworthieſt of your
ſpirituall Servants,
S A: GIBSON.
