To
The right illuſtrious
Lord, Goncales Argeto de
Molina, Provinciall, and grand
Iuſticiar, for his Majeſty, for the
holy brotherhood, of Andaluſia:
Lord of the Townes, of Veros,
and Dagancuelo: and of the
Caſtle of Gildolid. Alderman
of Civill,
&c.

THe great and particular
friendſhip,
which Antonio Gratian,
my brother,
that is in Heaven,
Counſellour of his Majeſty, and
Secretary to his royall perſon,
did finde with your Honour,
obliges mee, to acknowledge

it, and to accompt of it, as all
the good wits of this age doe:
behoulding in your Honour,
thoſe teſtimonies, which you
have afforded us in Armes, Government,
and writings, of his
much vertue, great courage and
cleare underſtanding. For having
at thirteene yeares old,
begun to ſerve his Majeſty in
the Warrs, and not forgetting
the exerciſe of learning, as we
may perceive by the pledges,
which Spaine enjoyes, and expects
from your Honours wiſdome,
in the governing of the
holy brother-hood, of Andaluzia:
which your Honour takes
charge of: he hath ſhewed his
worth, ſo that in one yeere
wherein he ſerved, by condemning
a great number to death
and the Gallies, he hath ſecured
this Province, which was ſo
waſted with robbers; And I am
confident the Divine, and humane

Majeſty, will grant your
Honour, the reward which
ſuch workes deſerve, which my
Galateo did rightly conſider, in
beſeeching of your Honour, to
accept of it, with the ſame affection,
it is offered. Our Lord
preſerve the right renouned
perſon, of your Honour, many
dayes, with as much increaſe
of wealth as is poſſible. From
Madrid the 10. of Ianuary, 1582.

Much renowned Sir,
your ſervant Lucas Gratian
Dantiſco, Kiſſes your
Honourable hands.
