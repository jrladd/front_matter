To the High and Mighty Monarch CHARLES By the Grace of God, of Great Brittain, France, and Ireland, King, &c.


SIR,


BEing filled with an admiration of your Royall parts, and a declaratory Fame of the Vertues and heroicke Actions of your Fame worthy Progenitors; and those transmitted unto You, by a successive Lineal and Hereditary right, so that that rare Coniunction of Castor and Pollux, I meane Majestas & ortu & Arte, are both happily conjoyned in your most

Sacred Personage. The curious survey of the multitude of your Princely parts breed in me a number of desires so that I have adventured to breake the barren soile of my poore portion; that prosperous successe should rather want to my indeavours, then diligent indeavours to my loyall determination. My submissive allegiance to Your Royall and Heroicke Vertues, have beene an encouraging cause to desire Your Maiesties gracious Patronage of this little Treatise of Gunners Art; but how my unworthinesse may hope of your Goodnesse, I cannot find but in the Notes of Your transcendent and gracious Disposition. Thus in the lowest humility of allegiance, I offer both my selfe, and the imployment of my undeserving Service freely to your Highnesse acceptance, and do desire both to be and appeare to be

Your Maiesties humblest and most devoted servant, Iohn Roberts.
