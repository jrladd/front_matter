TO
THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE,
MOST WORTHY
and Noble Lords, the Noble-men,
and others of the Covenant
of Scotland.

May it pleaſe your Lordſhips,

ACcording to your honours directions, the
Scouts (which were ſent into England,
to diſcover the eſtate of things
there) came unto me their Intelligencer
at London, who have collected
together all ſuch obſervations, as they
in their ſeverall travels have found, or my ſelfe obſerved,
either in my owne aboad now two yeares at London,
or in my returning home: But by reaſon of all

paſſages now ſhut up at ſea, and all Land wayes belayd, I
was forced to put my ſelfe in Arminian Attire, and ſo
came home through England, and ſo remayned ſome
certaine time in the Campe Royall, where my Collections
may manifeſt my love to my Countrey, and care of the
truſt by your Lordſhips impoſed upon me. But if my obſervations
be not anſwerable to your Lordſhips expectations,
I am heartily ſorry: Yet, yee may ſee, I have not bin
altogether idle, nor will be more careleſſe hereafter (as
occaſion is offered) then formerly I have beene, and ſhall in
my Northern newes (which is alſo now in collecting) make
good what is omitted, and in confidence of your favourable
acceptance hereof, I reſt,

Your Honours moſt humble
ſervant,
D. L.
