To the Right Honorable the Lord Scudamore, Ʋiſcount Sligo.

My Lord,


WHen the orbe of learning is illuſtrat by the irradiation, and benigne aſpect of Princes favours, then all things in a

Kingdome are conſpicuous and beautifull; but when the great Luminaries and Patrons of knowledge are eclipſed, the orbe muſt needs bee obſcured, and every thing within its circumference darkned; hence (as in the darkneſſe of the aire) men are troubled with ſtrange and miſhapen apparitions,

which they veryly beleeve are reall viſions, whereas indeed they are but phantomes and imaginations of our brains, which upon the introduction of a candle are eaſily disſipated; even ſo in the intellectuall darkneſſe, men are troubled with uncoth and hideous opinions, beleeving and embracing them as reall

truths, whereas indeed they are but illuſions.

Morte obita quales fama eſt volitare figuras,


Aut quae ſopitas deludunt ſomnia ſenſus.

Which upon the approach of the light of Scripture and Truth, do vaniſh into nothing. In this time when darkneſſe

hath overwhelmed the minds of many men, who are moleſted with ſtrange fancies, which they call new lights, whereas indeed they are but the glating of rotten wood, or of glowwormes, or thoſe skipping lights (which wee call jack in the candle) I have adventured to bring in this little tract, as a peice of

waxe candle, after ſo many bright torches, that men may be undeceived, and that the true abjects both of faith and practice may be manifeſted; to which ſmall peice J have prefixed your Lordſhips name, as being bound in the obligation of duty and affection to Your goodneſse and eminent parts

in generall; whoſe knowledge, judgment, conſcience, and ſincerity are ſuch, and ſo well known, both at home and abroad, as they need not the help of any pen; ſo likewiſe, J am tyed by this ſmall mite to expreſſe my gratitude, in particular for your Lordſhips favorable aſpect on, & reſpect to me;

which I cannot better teſtifie, then by acknowledging my ſelfe.

Your Lordſhips humble Servant to command
ALEXANDER ROSS.
