To the Honorable Houſe of Commons now aſſembled in the high Court of Parliament. The moſt humble Petition of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergie and Commons, within the County of Nottingham.
Humbly ſhewing
THat whereas we are informed, that a Petition, together with a Remonſtrance, hath in the Name of this County, beene heretofore preſented to this Honourable Houſe, for the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacie, and other alterations in Church-Government.
We doe humbly crave leave to certifie your Honours, that the ſame was done without our knowledge, or conſent, and that we doe hereby diſ-avow the ſame. And with the like humility, doe deſire That the long eſtabliſhed Government of the Church may ſtill continue, and that the abuſes and errors of ſome particular perſons, may not cauſe the alteration of the ancient Government; but rather, that ſuch perſons ſhould ſuffer according to their Demerits. And we likewiſe humbly crave, the Booke of Common-Prayer, by Law eſtabliſhed, may continue in force, with ſuch alteration (if there be cauſe) as to your Honours Wiſdomes ſhall ſeeme meet.

And as in Duty bound, We ſhall dayly pray, &c.
Subſcribed by one Vicount, five Knights, above a hundred Gentlemen of qualitie, all the Clergy of the County, and above a thouſand Commoners, being all of them Communicants.
