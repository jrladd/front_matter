To all loyall Covenanters,
contending for the Faith
of JESUS the CHRIST,
once given to the Saints;
Mat. 16. 16, 17.

C
Ʋrteous Reader, be not too cenſorious
concerning him that is
the Publiſher of this little
Treatiſe, ſtiled, The difference
between the Chriſtian and Antichriſtian
Church, as if hee condemned the Ages
and Generations that are paſt, as in a loſt
condition; becauſe he ſaith they have built
their houſe upon wood, and hay, and ſtubble,
and not upon the ſure rock Jeſus the
Chriſt: Farre be it from him to judge ſo

•
aſhly of the Ages and Generations paſt, or
preſent, concerning their finall eſtate; for

•
ee is commanded to judge no man before

•
he time, knowing that they ſtand and fall
to their owne Maſter: And, wee ſhall all
ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt;

And then and there every one ſhall give
an account for himſelfe to God, Rom. 14.
4, 10, 12. Knowing, as it is recorded in the
inſpired Scriptures, that If any man build
upon this foundation (Jeſus the Chriſt)
gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, wood, hay
ſtubble; Every mans work ſhall be made
manifeſt: for the day ſhall declare it; becauſe
it ſhall be revealed by fire: and th
•

fire ſhall try every mans worke. If any
mans worke abide, which hee hath buil
•

thereon,
hee ſhall receive a reward: If any
mans work ſhall be burnt, hee ſhall
ſuffer loſſe; but himſelfe ſhall be ſaved
yet ſo as by fire, 1 Cor. 3. 12, 13, 14, 15.
Secondly, Know that the diſcovery of
this truth was (as the viſion that is his
for an appointed time) and is become unto
us, as the words of a book that is ſealed,
which men deliver to one that is learned,
ſaying, Read this I pray thee: And h
•

ſaith, I cannot; for it is ſealed. And th
•

book is delivered to him that is not learned,
ſaying, Read this I pray thee: An
•

hee ſaith, I am not learned, Eſay 29. 11, 12▪
So that it is not in him that is learned, no
•

in him that is unlearned, to diſcover the
myſtery of iniquity, by which Antichriſ
•

hath filled the Temple ſo full of ſmoak, that
no man can ſee how to enter into it, unti
•


God enlighten him; which cauſed the Lord
Jeſus in the dayes of his fleſh, to break out
into an Euchariſtia of praiſe, looking on
his Diſciples, I thank thee, O Father, Lord
of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe
things from the wiſe and learned, and haſt
revealed them unto babes. Even ſo, O Father,
becauſe it ſeemed good in thy ſight,
Mat. 11. 25, 26. That the whole glory in
diſcovering of truth to any, might be given
unto God.
Thirdly, Know (gentle Reader, who
art a ſearcher after truth in theſe inquiring
times) that the Publiſher wrote this
Treatiſe, to diſcover that the difference
lieth not ſo much amongſt us in point of
Baptiſme; as it is about the Doctrine of
the Faith of Jeſus the Chriſt, the Sonne
of God; which whoſoever beleeveth and
confeſſeth, that Jeſus the Chriſt is the Son
of God, it is lawfull to baptize him, Act. 8.
36, 37, 38. And, to which Faith of Jeſus
the Chriſt, and Baptiſme, the promiſe of
receiving the gifts of the holy Spirit is
given, Act. 2. 38, 39. And though for publiſhing
this myſtery of Faith, which hath
been hidden for ſome Ages and Generations
that are paſt, hee ſuffer reproach and
contempt from the hands and tongues of
ſome; yet, if the will of God be ſo, it is better

hee ſuffer for well-doing, then for evill.
Yet the love that hee beareth to the loyall
Covenanters in the Nation, conſtraineth
him to doe it, rather then his Country-men
ſhould ever remaine in blindneſſe, under
the power of Antichriſt.

Thine, who is the unworthieſt of
all the ſervants of Chriſt, (who
is content it ſhould be ſaid of his
good name, that is as a precious
oyntment, as Luther ſaid of Moſes
his body, Let it die and rot,
ſo God may be glorified, and Jeſus
the Chriſt exalted in all his
royall Offices;)
FRAN. CORNWELL.
