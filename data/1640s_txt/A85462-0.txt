RIGHT HONORABLE,


ACcording to the Fame we have heard of you, ſo have we found in you, a ſpirit of tenderneſſe and compaſsion towards the oppreſſed, which ever ſprings from the courage and fortitude of a heart reſolute to ſuppreſſe the Oppreſſor, be his power and policie what it may, whilſt men unſenſible of the cauſe of the Needy, ever ſtand in readineſſe to ſide with the ſtrongeſt partie, and ſo (as occaſion ſerves) to become one with the cruell, venting the ſame ſpirit, which for advantage can eaſily transform it ſelfe, ſo as if

power comply with the juſt mans cauſe, the vizard of hypocriſie is ſoon put on by ſuch, either to become dumb & ſilent, or elſe to ſpeak ſo, as may beſt advantage it ſelfe, let the cauſe be what it will. Your wiſdom and noble care in thoſe weighty affairs committed to your truſt, commands and binds us over to make a more particular and full relation (then formerly we have done) of what hath paſſed betwixt ſome other Colonies in NEVV-ENGLAND, and our ſelves; that if it be poſsible to find any leiſure hours in a crowd of ſo great imployments, your Honours might be pleaſed to take a more full view of things; in the mean time we ſtand humbly ingaged, as we have done; and ever ſhall in any ſervice, that what we are, or have, can tender to the honour and peace of our Native Countrey, or to any truehearted well-Wiſher thereof; and if no other ſervice (we can) may be acceptable, yet of this imployment none ſhall prevent us (whilſt our God gives us hearts) daily to pray for you.

Your Honours moſt humble Servants, the Inhabitants of Shaw-omet, whoſe names are often expreſſed in this Narration.
