To the right Honourable MOVNTIOY Earle of Newport, Lord Mountioy, Master of his Maiesties Ordnance.

Right honorable:


THe favourable countenance and furthering Respect which my Predecessors received of that renowned Generall, and ever memorable and remarkable Martialist the Right Honourable the Earle of Devonshire, of never dying Memory, your Lordships late deceased Honour'd Father, together with the Duty and Oblegiance, all those of my Quality owe unto your Honour; by reason of the Place and Dignity most deservedly You are in, and called to; makes me of Socrates Opinion, in acknowledging all my utmost

not able to reach the halfe height of your Lordships Favour: Wherefore labouring like the Bee, sucking from the choycest Flowers the best Honey I can gather, the night of rest being come, I bring it to the Hive of your kind acceptance, and there leave it, as much labour bestowed about little, till diligent imployment may more amply increase it. Right Honourable, I am loath to be troublesome, especially where affable Gentlenesse out paceth any merit in my Selfe: Therefore presenting your Lordship with this Treatise of Gunners Art, and my attendant Service, when it shall please your Honour to imploy me; and praying devoutly for the endlesse prosperity of You, and yours, I humbly conclude

Your Honours, in all duty to be commanded. John Roberts.
