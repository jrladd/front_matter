To the Worshipfull, and his honorred Kinsman, Robert Ducie, of Aston, in the County of Stafford Esquire: Son to Sir Robert Ducie, Knight and Baronet Deceased.

Sir,


NOt to boast of any perfections, I have never yet bin Owner of Ingratitude, and would bee loath Envy should taxe mee now; having at this time opportunity to pay part of that debt I owe your love. This Tragedy had at the presentment a generall Applause; yet I have not that want of modesty, as to conclude it wholly worthy your Patronage; although I have bin bold to fixe your name unto it. Yet however, your Charity will be famous in protecting this Plant, from the breath of Zoilus; and forgiving this my confidence: and your acceptance cherish a study of a more deserving Peece, to quit the remainder of the ingagement: In


Your Kinsman ready to serve you
â–ª Thomas Rawlins.
