TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL Sr EDWARD POWEL, Knight and Baronet, one of the Maſters of his Mties Court of Requeſts.

Noble Sir,


THere is a double Tie upon my duty towards you, that bindes me to the largeſt acknowledgement that can bee expreſt by my beſt abilities:

Your generall eminence both in Honour, and, the worthieſt meanes to it, Deſert (which duly chalenge the generall obſervance of all men) and your particular noble favours to me, that require from me a never ſufficient gratitude. But as Preſents derive their value as well from the eſteeme of the Receiver,

as from their owne inherent qualities; ſo will you make this rich by your acceptance, that is without all worth as it is my poore Donative, though it containe in it ſelfe many ſecret and myſticall vertues, being an Enchiridion of many rare ſubjects, both Morall and Divine, fit for the moſt ſerious

obſervation and meditation: The induſtry of many excellently-learned Authors, whoſe ſeverall Papers were moſt accidentally committed to me, to be their fortunate, though unworthy, preſerver and Publiſher. The only end for which I beg your Noble diſpoſition to entertaine it, is that it may be underſtood a teſtimony

of his due thankfulneſſe, whoſe only ambition is to be knowne and ſtiled,

The humbleſt of your ſervants. R. H.
