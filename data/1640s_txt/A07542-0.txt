TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, MY VERY good Lord, THOMAS Earle of Winohelsee, &c.


RIGHT HON:

WHen I had compos'd these unpolish'd lines, and being urg'd by some of my friends, to put

them into the wide world, to shift for themselves; I thought it somewhat an unnaturall part, to turne my new-borne Muse out of doores harbourlesse being unknowne, lest she should be tost to and fro, with some hollow blast of arrogant breath. Then musing on the many undeserved favours that I have received from your Lordship, which I know not how to requite; I thought of presenting my home-bred Muse to your Honour; being

the first fruits of my poore indeavours in this kinde, and as part of the testimony of my humble service in thankfulnes to your Lordship. Although somewhat discouraged, when I considered the greatnesse of your person, together with your worth, and gifts of minde, meeting with learning and pietie, which makes you shine as a fixed Starre in our English region. And then looking backe how unworthy my plaine Muse is

of your Honours acceptation; But when I considered againe, what small and weake indeavours (such which might claime kindred with this of mine) have beene accepted of great personages when they have been drawn as a clew from the bowels of love (which I hope your Lordship conceives no lesse of mine.) And the Eagle though shee soares aloft, doth not disdaine to stoope low, and the Sunne that is so glorious, doth not

deny his spangled beams, nor cloud his smiling countenance from these infereour darke bodies here below, and that the noblest spirits are accompanied with the humblest mindes (which I have ever found in your Lordship) then my doubts vanisht as the mist before the heate: so I resolved to present (as here I doe) these lines to your Honours protection, Humbly craving your Lordships acceptation, that they may beare

your name; So with your Honours countenance, they shall passe secure; Thus praying that the Lord will inrich you with spirituall blessings, and that the dew of heaven may sweeten the fatnesse of the earth, to you and your noble off-spring forever.

And remaine your Honours most humble Servant: HUMPHRY MILL.
