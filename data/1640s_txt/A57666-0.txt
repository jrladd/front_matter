To the Right honourable GEORGE Lord BERKLEY, Baron of Berkley, &c.

My Lord,

THey who have been long at sea, when they come on shore, think that the Earth moveth as the Sea did, till their brains be settled; even so these men who have been lately travelling in the new found world of the Moon, which swiftly moveth about the Earth, think when they come down hither, that it is the Earth which moveth: This false imagination I have endeavoured to remove in this Book, which now comes abroad under your Lordships Name; the reason of my dedication is, because I understand by your Lordship, that the Gentleman, who came down a while agoe from the Moon, with newes of a late discovery there, is of this opinion; and one who hath relation to your Lordship, which indeed I knew not till now, that the Book is almost printed: my other reason is, for that I am bound in a dutifull recognition of your Lordships respects to scholars in generall, and to me in particular; which sheweth that not only are you noble by extraction, but by your affection also and disposition to learning, which is now so much slighted, yea vilified, by such as are either ignorant, or wicked; the one slight learning, because they know it not,—ignoti nulla cupido; and like the Fox in the Fable, disparage the grapes, because he could not reach them; the other raile against learning, as the mad Africans do against the Sun; and how can Owles and Bats love the light, which manifest their deformity? Can theeves and cut-throats, whilst they are penetrating the works of darknesse, abide the light of a torch? The infernall ghosts tremble to see any light,
—trepdiant immisso lumine manes:
But your Lordship, being de meliore luto,— knowes the worth of learning, and therefore loves it; which that you may long know, love, and live, shall be the wish of


Your Honours most humble servant to command,
ALEXANDER ROSS.
