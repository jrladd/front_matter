The Dedication.

LOrd, my first fruits should have been sent to thee,
For thou the tree
That bare them, onely lentest unto me.
But while I had the use, the fruit was mine,
Not so divine
As that I dare presume to call it thine.
Before 'twas ripe, it fell unto the ground:
And since I found
It bruised in the dirt, nor cleane nor sound;
Some I have wip'd and pickt, and bring thee now,
Lord, thou know'st how:
Gladly I would, but dare it not avow.
Such as it is, 'tis here. Pardon the best,
Accept the rest:
Thy pardon and acceptance maketh blest.
