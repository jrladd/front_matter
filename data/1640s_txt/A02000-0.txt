To the high, Noble, and
moſt Illuſtrious:
CHARLES,
Prince of Wales, &c.

SIr, let the ſtrength
of my deſires to ſerve
you, obtaine your pardon,
for this my triviall dedication.
Yet if the title of this
booke bee true, (which is not
mine, but the firſt authors) it
may prove worthy your inſpection;
if not, your peruſall. For,
the few rules therein conteyned,
(if he may be credited)
being well obſerved, will gaine

you the love of all men; and
(conſequently) command
their obedience. Two things,
which Princes, above others,
have greatest neede of, and
wherein they become moſt happy,
being made thereby, more
abſolute, then either by rigor
of Lawes, or force of Armes.
It is (I confeſſe) moſt true,
that the great deedes, and heroick
actions of Princes, are
of higheſt eſteeme: yet are they
not (therefore) to bee altogether
regardleſſe, even of their
ordinary behaviour, and uſuall
cariage. For as by them, they
become moſt powerfull, and
renouned: ſo by theſe, (if
pleaſing, and gracefull) they

grow more endeered, in the
peopls affections. This treatiſe
was firſt penned by a Courtyer.
Therefore if it bee not well
tranſlated, no marvaile, for
how ſhould a plodding Lawyer,
make a neate conſtruction, of a
quaint and polite Gallants
meaning? rude as it is, I hope
your highneſſe will be pleaſed
to accept of it, not caſting
your eye ſo much upon the
courſe viſage, of the preſent,
as upon the faire intentions
of the preſenter. I confeſſe
there be no dainties in it, fit
for your curious palate, yet
(I beſeech you) bee pleaſed
to taſt of it, that others, for
whom ſuch courſe fare is farre

more proper, may thereby
bee brought, to reliſh it
the better. All I will ſay
in its commendation, is this:
it is but briefe, and is full
of variety.

Inner Temple the 28
of March, 1640.

Sir,
I am
Your Highneſſes in all
duty and obſervance
to be commanded,
William Style.
