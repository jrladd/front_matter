TO THE
WORSHIPFVLL
AND MUCH
HONOURED
JOHN PYMME
Eſquire,


SIR,


IT is no part
of my deſigne
in this
Dedication,
by the reflexion of
ſmooth language, to
ſhew you yourſelfe in

your glory, or to take
the worke of admiring
your worth, out
of the hands of all
the world, who are
now very intent, and
buſie at it. If honour
and approbation will
pay debts, the Nation
(I conceive) is not
much behinde with
you, for all the ſervice
you have done it: for
(as farre as I underſtand)
you have ſcarce
enemies enough, to
deliver you out of the
hand of that curſe of

our Saviour, Wo be to
you when all men speake
well of you, Luk. 6. 26.
I have no authority to
queſtion the ſingleneſſe,
and uprightneſſe
of your heart, in
thoſe notable and
noble engagements,
that are upon you:
yet if you will plead
your ſelfe to doe it,
the ſecurity attending
thereon, will beare
the charges. When
credit and conſcience
are yoked, and draw
the Chariot together,

Conſcience (ofttimes)
proves dull,
and heavie in the
worke, and if not
ſometimes remembred
with the goade,
and put on, will ſuffer
credit to draw all on
the one ſide, and ſo
lay her fellow on the
wheele. It argues an
high, and excellent
frame of ſpirit where
a man can follow
with intenſneſſe of
minde, things that be
of good report, and
yet not be over-acted

with the goodneſſe
of the report; but
fetch the ſtrength of
that inſpiration, by
which hee is carried
on in his motion,
from the goodneſſe
of him that hath commanded
it. The more
God is intereſſed in
our intentions, the
more he is like to intereſt
himſelfe in our
executions. If wee
make him a ſtranger
in the propoſition of
our ends, hee takes no
pleaſure to make himſelfe

knowne unto us
in our proſecutions,
except it be by way
of oppoſition, and
riſing up againſt us.
The royall method in
great actions, to
breake all difficulties,
and barre off diſcouragements
in ſunder,
as with a rod of iron,
is to digge out of our
ſelves as much of our
earth, that is, as much
of our ſelves as wee
can come at, and fill
up the pit, or empty
place, with God and

zeale for his glorie.
The conſecration of
an enterpriſe is ſoveraigne
againſt abortion,
whereas to
worke for a mans
ſelfe alone, is little
leſſe, being interpreted,
than to betray
his action, and to
give ſecurity to his enemies,
that God
ſhall not build with
him, nor proſper him
in his way: and conſequently,
that his labour
in building ſhall
be in vaine.


The leaſt offenſive
(I am ſure) and yet
withall, (with ſerious
and inſide men) as
weightie a teſtimony
(as I conceive) as can
be given to your wiſdome,
is to ſpeake
thus in the plaine dialect
of the ancient
ſimplicity unto you,
and not to ſpare
you, as farre as the
truth may doe you
good. Neither doe I
conceive, wherein any
mans worth or
wiſdome can do him

better ſervice, than by
ſtrengthening others
to lay on himſelfe to
beare greater weights
of this treaſure, than
men of an under-ſufficiencie
are able to
ſtand under.
The Diſciples themſelves,
were great
looſers (for the time)
by their weakneſſe,
in this kinde; they
wanted the ſweete
company, and converſe
of many high
and important apprehenſions,
which

(doubtleſſe) had bin
equall too (if not
much better then) the
ſociety of ſo many
Angels, becauſe in reſpect
of the preſent
infirmity of their ſpirits,
they were as unable
to beare the
ſtrength of their influence
and working,
as the frailty of the
fleſh and blood is, to
abide the glory and
preſence of thoſe Embaſſadours
of heaven.
Their gratious, and
great Lord and Maſter

himſelfe, plainely
profeſſed this unto
them: I have many
things (ſaith he) to ſay
unto you, but you cannot
beare them now, Joh. 16.
12. And had they
not out growne this
weakeneſſe afterwards,
by meanes of
that golden ſhowre
from heaven, wherein
they were rained
upon with the Holy
Ghoſt, and with power,
they had beene
kept faſting from the
feaſt of thoſe fat

things (whatſoever
they were), all the
dayes of their lives.
The reaſon why
the world (ſo generally)
drinkes old
wine (in our Saviours
Metaphor)
which is of a lower
and flatter taſte, is, becauſe
their veſſels are
not new, and ſtrong:
and therefore not fit
to have new wine
(which is of a ſtronger,
and more lively,
of a more ſtirring,
working, and provoking

ſpirit) put
into them for feare of
breaking. Wee have
but the light of the
Moone inſtead of the
light of the Sunne, or
at moſt, but the light
of the Sun, inſtead
of the ſevenfold light
of ſeven dayes, promiſed
Eſa. 30. 26.
ſhining to us, becauſe
wee are tender eyed,
and inconſiderately
afrayd, leſt an excellency
of knowledge
ſhould undoe
us.


Not to wrong (in
the leaſt meaſure)
the rights of Heaven
in point of thankfulneſſe,
due from us,
nor to quench the
leaſt ſparke of the joy
of our congratulations:
for the bleſſing
of knowledge powred
out unto us ſo abundantly,
above the
line and meaſure of
former ages, certaine
it is, that truthes of
higheſt importance,
and which ſhould
joyne Heaven and

Earth neerer together,
and heale a great
part of that deplorable
diſtance, which
yet lyeth betweene
men and Angels, and
ſo advance and quicken
the ſpirituall entercourſe,
and commerce
betweene the
two worlds, are little
ſtirring in the world.
One maine reaſon
whereof is, becauſe,
as the Diſciples of
Chriſt, when they
ſaw their deareſt
Lord & Maſter comming

towards them
upon the water, were
ſore afraid, and cryed
out, ſuppoſing he had
beene a ſpirit, that
had appeared as an
executioner of preſent
death upon
them, who yet was
the glory and crowne
of their ſecurity: ſo
many in the world
(no worſe affected
neither, to the truth,
in generall, than
they were to Chriſt)
crie out, as men out
of meaſure troubled,

at the firſt glimmering,
and appearing
of ſome truthes unto
them, as if they were
the ſpirits of Devills
comming upon the
world, for the ſpoile
and ruine of the pretious
ſoules of men;
whereas, were they
capable of their inſpiration,
and either
did, or were but inwardly
willing to
know of what ſpirit
they were, they could
not but acknowledge
and confeſſe, that

they were of the deareſt,
and deepeſt, and
ſweeteſt confederacie
with Heaven. It was
Auſtines complaint
long ſince: Nonnulli
intelligentes citius volunt
exagitare, quod non
intelligunt, quam quaerere,
ut intelligant, & non
fiunt humiles inquiſitores,
ſed ſuperbi calumniatores,
Aug. de Temp.
Serm. 72. I forbeare
to make Engliſh of
this Latine: becauſe
the party chiefly intereſſed,
are (for the

moſt part) men of the
language.
But Sir, I conſider
the weight and importunitie
of your
preſent imployments,
I know you are (with
your worthy Aſſiſtants)
about a great
and laborious cure,
(the Lord proſper it
under your hands)
and farre be it from
mee to deſire, that this
ſhould ſuffer in the
leaſt, through any occaſion
of mine. I had
not preſumed thus

farre, but that this
little piece had ſtucke
in the birth ſome
yeares together, and
was well neere ſtifled,
found now a
way into the world,
by the providence of
God, and by the benigne
aſpect, and influence
of that happy
conſtellation, wherein
your ſelfe ſhine as
a ſtarre, in much glory.
And the ſubject
of it being of that
neere affinity and ſympathy
with the ſoveraigne

piece of that
great worke you have
in hand, the reſcue,
and advancement of
the Goſpell, I ſhould
(I conceive) have
turn'd my backe upon
that providence
which look't mee in
the face, if I ſhould
not have preſented it
to ſome of thoſe
Worthies, whom
God hath anointed
with wiſdome, grace,
and power, as for the
bringing of many
greater, and weightier

things to paſſe, ſo
(the event bearing
witneſse) for the helping
forth of it alſo
into the world.
In which great and
honourable aſſembly,
I knew not one,
whom rather to caſt
mine eye for this dedication,
than on
your ſelfe, who, as
you are knowne to
the whole Nation, by
your worth and zeale,
for the things both of
God and Men, ſo
have you beene

knowne to my ſelfe,
heretofore, by ſome
more particular acquaintance:
the diſcontinuance
and decreaſe
whereof, I impute
onely to mine
owne unworthineſſe,
and negligence in addreſſing
my ſelfe unto
you.
I doe not in theſe
meditations put you
upon any thing (in
the maine) but wherein
you have prevented
my motion, and
are already home-engaged:

I know you
are in for the Goſpell,
with all your heart,
and with all your
ſoule, and if with all
theſe, with all whatſoever
beſides. So that
you might (in that
reſpect) expoſtulate
with mee the impertinencie
of this my
addreſſe unto you, in
thoſe, or ſuch like
termes, 
〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
.
What neede you
quicken him that maketh
haſte? Yet make I no
queſtion, but that of

your ſelfe you know,
how fairly to ſalve
the ſeaſonableneſſe,
and uſefulneſſe here of
notwithſtanding: In
which regard, an apologie
would prove
the impertinency, not
the Dedication. I verilly
beleeve, that P
•••


never met with Chriſtians
ſo abundant in
the worke of the
Lord, but ſtill hee exhorted
them to a
bound yee more.
Beſides, though I
cannot ſay with the

confidence of an intuitive
knowledge,
that you meete with
any ſecret feares, diſcouragements,
conflicts
of doubtfull
thoughts, and reaſonings
with your ſelfe
in the way of that
contention for the
truth, which now you
ſuſtaine: yet can I
hardly beleeve, but
that ſometimes you
feele the activeneſſe
of the powers of
darkeneſſe againſt
you, and finde ſome

inſinuations, and
grudgings, (if not
ſtronger, and ſharper
fits) of feares touching
the ſucceſſe, and
iſſue of your great
undertakings. In
which reſpect, I conceive,
it ſhould not
be unſeaſonable altogether,
to adminiſter
unto you, of thoſe
excellent comfortations
and ſtrengthenings
of heaven, which
the Holy Ghoſt hath
treaſured up in the
Scriptures, for ſuch

times, and occaſions
(eſpecially) as theſe.
The Lord Ieſus Chriſt
himſelfe, being in
deepe conflict, was refreſhed
by the preſence
of an Angell
from Heaven comforting
him, Luk. 23.
43. The conſolations
of the ſpirit in the
Word of God, adminiſtred
by a hand
conſecrated thereunto,
have ſometimes
beene little inferiour
in the glory of their
effects, to thoſe of

Angelicall diſpenſation.
I dare not undertake
for any ſapientiall
advantage you are
like to gaine for the
Faith, by the peruſall
of theſe few pages:
I know if there bee
any to be gotten, you
will not overlooke it.
Yet give mee leave to
ſay this: that the
beſt and wiſeſt mens
thoughts, apprehenſions,
purpoſes, ends,
intentions in their
beſt actions, will never

lye right, and
ſtraight in their bowels,
nor with that
eaſe and intimate ſatisfaction
to their
owne ſpirits, except
they be marſhalled,
ranged, and compoſed
by the hand of
the ſpirit of God,
ſtretched out from the
Scriptures.
The God of grace
and glory, who
in your ſelfe, together
with that worthy
Senate of joynt
conſultations with

you, hath opened a
doore of hope to a
Land and People,
brought very low,
and hath begun by
your mouthes to
breath upon the dry
bones, ſo that there
is ſome noyſe and
ſhaking heard already,
bring them together,
bone to his
bone, and fleſh upon
them alſo, in due
time, and cover them
with a skin, and put
a ſpirit of life into
them, that they may

live: and recompence
abundantly
into their boſome,
the labours and travells,
and faithfulneſſe
of thoſe, whoſe
hearts, and hands
have beene, and ſtill
are lifted up to
the worke, that taſting
the preſence,
and mightie hand
of God with them,
they may rejoyce as
ſtrong men to runne
the remainder of
their race, and not
faint or waxe wearie;

till the great
breach bee repaired,
till the throne, and
kingdome of Ieſus
Chriſt bee lifted up
on high, above the
rage, power, and
contradictions of
thoſe, that ſeeke to
lay the glory of it
in the duſt; till
judgement runne
downe like water,
and righteouſneſſe
as a mightie ſtreame,
to waſh; and carry
away all the filth;
and noyſomeneſſe

of the Land, till
the hearts, and
mouthes of all thoſe
who love the peace,
and proſperitie of
the Nation, bee filled
with joy, and
gladneſſe, and the
faces of all that are
enemies unto it,
with ſhame, and
confuſion. And for
your ſelfe, your
perſonall honour,
peace, and ſafety,
you have an interreſt
in your ſelfe
(which ſleepeth

not) in the prayers
of


Coleman-ſtreete

Decemb.
