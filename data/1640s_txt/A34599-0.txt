TO THE
HONOVRABLE
AND
True-hearted lover of
his Countrey, Sir HENRY
VANE Junior, Knight, ſometimes
Governour of New-England;
Treaſurer of the Navie Royall,
and a Member of the
Houſe of COMMONS.

Sir,


1 Cor. 14 27
THe Churches of the Saints
and the World, may not
bee unfitly compared to
the Pearle and the Pebble:
though both of one naturall
ſubſtance, earth; yet the one of
rare price, whoſe beauty is the ſunbeames
incloſed; the other wanting

it, is caſt away as refuſe. What
maketh the Saint more excellent
then his neighbour, ſeeing both are
borne of fleſh, both ſubject to the
ſame corruptions, ſickneſſe, death,
but this?Epheſ. 4. 24 The Saints excellency is
nothing elſe but the Image of Jeſus
Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe
ſhining in him: For as the moone
and ſtarres derive their light from
the ſunne;1 Cor. 1. 30 ſo all the wiſdome, righteouſneſſe,
holineſſe a Saint hath,
hee deriveth from Chriſt. Hence
David the King doth ſo prize their
fellowſhip, All my delight is in thy
Saints,
Pſal. 16. 3.
thine excellent ones that are in
the earth, and them that excell in vertue.
Yea, it is a ſure note of a Citizen
of Sion, that hee honours them
that feare the Lord:
Pſal 15. Whereas worldly
men without grace, are rendred
in his eyes as vile. Hence the Spouſe
acknowledgeth that all her excellency
cometh from plantation; Let
my Beloved come into his garden,
Cant 4 16.
and
eat his pleaſant fruit. Yea, Chriſt

declareth to Nicodemus that a beleevers
holineſſe cometh from regeneration;
Joh. 3. 5.
that in Chriſt hee may
onely glory. How doth the Lord
diſcover this his excellency to a
beleever, by his calling, till that
time hee lieth amongſt the refuſe
of the world,Tit. 3. 3. as fooliſh, diſobedient,
deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,
living in malice and envie, hatefull,
and hating one another. But then
the kindneſſe and love of God to
man appeared,Col. 1. 13. by delivering him out
of the kingdome of darkneſſe, and tranſlating
him into the kingdome of his
deare Sonne. By which it is manifeſt,
that hee is one of the Choſen generation,
the royal prieſthood,
1 Pet. 2. 9. the holy nation,
the peculiar people, whom hee
hath called out of darkneſſe into his marvellous
light. But when doth the
Lord diſcover the truth of his calling
to his conſcience? Then when
hee giveth him precious faith; for
that onely diſtinguiſheth him form
the world that lieth in ſinne. Gal. 3.

22. The Scripture concludeth (father,
mother, ſonne, daughter, nay the
infant that is borne of the moſt
holieſt parents) all under ſinne, that
the promiſe by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt
might bee given to them that beleeve.
So that in that ſame houre the Lord
giveth him faith, hee giveth him
an evidence in himſelfe,Heb 15. 1. that hee
loved him in Chriſt before he was
borne,Rom 9 11. before hee had done good
or evill,Act. 13. 39. that hee hath juſtified him
from all thoſe things hee could not
be juſtified by the Law,Heb. 
•
. 14. that hee
hath purged his conſcience from all
dead works, that his perſon is accepted,
his ſinne diſcharged,Act 26. 1
•
. and he
hath a right to the purchaſed inheritance
amongſt them which are
ſanctified. Thus the love of Chriſt
revealed to dye for him, to take
away his iniquity, and reconcile
him to God; the Spirit given to
take away his heart of ſtone,Eccl. 36. 25. 26. giveth
him an heart of fleſh, to cauſe to
walke in his flatutes; yea, and draweth

his heart to yeeld obedience to
every commandement of Jeſus the
Chriſt. The truth of this grace
given, Right Worſhipfull, you can
give a true teſtimoniall; for you
were once in your naturall condition
as well as others, till it pleaſed
God who ſeparated you from
the womb,Gal. 
•
. 15, 1
•
. to call you by his grace,
to reveale his Sonne in you; you
conſulted not with fleſh and bloud,
but left your native ſoyle,

〈…〉

 (in the
perſecuting times of the Prelates)
chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with
the people of God (according to
the light they had received) then
to remaine in England and enjoy the
pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon. Yet there
the Lord exalted your Worſhip to
bee the Governour: And in that
dawning light, coming forth out
of myſticall Babylon, the Lord diſcovered
much ſpirituall knowledge,
of the riches of his free-grace in
Jeſus Chriſt, amongſt you; you being
freed from the yoke of the TaskMaſters

heere, the Biſhops, that
kept you in bondage: you had liberty
there to debate thoſe Queſtions;
which the naming onely of
them heere, would have rendred
a man odious. But Satan that envieth
the peace of the Saints; ſtirred
up a ſpirit of contention amongſt
you; eſpecially when theſe
Queries came to be debated.

1 Whether there are any gracious
conditions, or qualifications
wrought in the ſoule before faith?
2 Whether any man can gather his
evidence of the aſſurance of his
Juſtification from his Sanctification?
3 Whether there bee an active power
of Faith, and other gifts of grace
in a Chriſtian converſation?

The one ſide would not beleeve
themſelves juſtified, no farther then
they could ſee themſelves worke;
making their Markes, Signes, and

Qualifications, the cauſes of their
Juſtification.
The other ſide, laid the Evidence
of their Juſtification, onely by Faith
in the free Promiſe: for there are
foure things that makes remiſſion of
ſinnes perpetuall to a beleever.
Firſt, The cauſe of Remiſſion, the
ſacrificed Body of Chriſt on the
Croſſe, or accurſed Tree; Heb. 10.
4. By one offering, hee hath perfected
for ever them that are ſanctified.

Secondly, The ground is a free
promiſe tendred to us from God; as
to Adam, The Seed of the Woman
ſhall breke the Serpents head, Gen. 3.
15. John. 3. 16. 1 John 4. 10.
Thirdly, The meane is, Faith apprehending
it, Phil. 3. 9.
Fourthly, The Spirit of Chriſt ſealing
of it, Epheſ. 1. 13.
This truth revealed for the comfort
of poore drooping Saints found
great oppoſition; But the good
Lord, ſtirred up your gracious
ſpirit, to countenance, and defend

them in the midſt of ſtrong oppoſition;
and though you were ſleighted,
and ſet light by at the ende of
your Government, as not worthy
to be an aſſiſtant, with many other
Inſtruments more; yet the good
Lord ſtood by you, and ſtrengthned
you, and delivered you from
the hands of your oppoſers, perſerved
you from the dangers of the
Sea; and though at your returne to
your Native Soyle, you lived like
Joſeph, a while, in a deſpiſed condition,
yet the Lord raiſed you up
to ſit amongſt Princes. So that
though you were willing to loſe
life, friends, preferment, for Chriſt;
found you not then, life, peace, joy,
in the Lord Jeſus, which was better
to you, then all worldly amity;
according to his owne promiſe,
In the World you found affliction,
but in him you found peace: And
when you were called to be a Member
of the high Court of Parliament,
in our diſtreſſed and diſtracted

times; the Lord made you an

•
nſtrument to defect the Trecherous
plot of thoſe two brethren in evill;
Thomas Lord Strafford; and William

Chronicle: that after-ages may never

mercy to your Noble Poſterity
that did not thinke your life (together

•
ain
not to receive from the hand of
a poore deſpiſed Inſtrument that preſents
this Treatiſe, The Learned Conference
of Maſter John Cotton, that
he had with the Elders, at the Bay of
Boſton in New England. Though I
am the leaſt of all Saints, not worthy
to be called a Saint; becauſe

•
n the time of the Prelats raigne; I

•
ided with them, in perſecuting the
Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and impriſoning
of his Members; But did it

•
gnorantly, through unbeliefe, and
when the Lord pierced my heart
for it; I trembling, cryed, What ſhall
I doe? The holy Spirit and the
Bride ſaid, Repent, and bee baptized
in the name of Jeſus, for the remiſsion
of ſinnes, and I ſhould receive the gifts
of the Spirit, &c. Then Noble Sir,
though I procraſtinated it for a ſeaſon,
at laſt, I was not diſobedient to
the heavenly voice, but aroſe, and

was Baptized; For this cauſe,
have beene much oppoſed by my
old Friends, and Countrey-men▪
But yet remaine a Loyall Cove
•
nanter,
that ſtandeth for a Reformation
in England, and Ireland, a
•
greeable
to the Word of God, and
the beſt Reformed Churches: Seeing
it is not the voice of the Churches,
but Chriſt in the Churches
we Convenented to hearken unto
as Maſter Caſe his Sermon yet teſtifieth.
Firſt, To extirpate Popery; (which
I apprehended at the taking of the
Nationall Covenant) was that
Doctrine of Antichriſt, which doth
univerſally oppoſe the doctrine of
Jeſus the Chriſt. Affirming what
Chriſt denieth; and denying what
Chriſt affirmeth.
Secondly, Prelacy, viz. The Government
of Arch-biſhops, and Biſhops,
and all Eccleſiaſticall Officers
depending on that Hierarchy,

Roote and Branch: as a Plant the
heavenly Father hath not planted.
Thirdly, Superſtition: viz. Whatſoever
is ſupra Statutum, that hath
not the word of God to warrant
it.
Fourthly, Schiſme: Namely,
from all thoſe that teach, and co
••
ſent
not to the wholeſome words,even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and to the doctrine which is according
to godlineſſe; from ſuch I muſt withdraw,
1 Tim. 6. 3, 5.
Fifthly, Hereſie: Even from all
them that deny that Jeſus is the
Chriſt; They are Antichriſt that deny
the Father and the Sonne. Whoſoever
denyeth the Sonne, the ſame hath not
the Father, 1 Joh. 2. 22, 23.
Sixthly, That the Lord may be one:
viz. Even the Lord Jeſus the Chriſt,
whom God raiſed from the dead, and

•
et him at his owne right hand in the

•
eavenly places; Farre above all principality,
and power, and might, and

dominion, and every name that is named,
not onely in this world, but that
which is to come: And hath put all
things under his feet, and gave him to
be head over all things to the Church,
Which is his body, the fulneſſe of him
that filleth all in all, Epheſ. 1. 20, 21
22, 23.
Seventhly, And his Name to 
•

one in the three Kingdomes: (that is,
as I conceive it) his power, authority,
and royall Commiſſion muſt
be exalted in all his Offices, to be
the eternall King, eternall Prophet,
and eternall Prieſt, in all things
appertaining to the conſcience: ſeeing
the loyall Spouſe of Chriſt hath
no Head, no Husband, no Lord,
no Law-giver, but royall King Jeſus.
That wee, and our poſterity after
us, may live in faith, and love;
and the Lord may delight to dwell
amongst us.



For the keeping of which Covenant,
I had rather chuſe to dye,
then to deny the faith of Jeſus the
Chriſt: Knowing, that he which
confeſſeth him before men, him he
will confeſſe before his Father.
But hee which is aſhamed of Chriſt,

•
nd his words, in this ſinfull and adulterous
generation, of him alſo ſhall
the Sonne of man bee aſhamed, when
hee cometh in the glory of his Father,
with the holy Angels, Mar. 8. 38.
Thus I deſire, in the firſt place,Mat 22. 21 to
give to God the things that are Gods;
and, in the next place, render to
the high and honourable Court of
Parliament, whereof your Honour
is a Member, and to your King,
when the Lord ſhall put it into his
heart to returne unto his Parliament,
and to joyne with you, all
your dues,Rome. 13. 7. tributes, cuſtomes, feare,
honour; and ſubject my ſelfe to
obey all your juſt, legall, and civill
commandements: Knowing, that

you ſet not up the Sword for
nought;

•
 Pet. 2. 14 but to be a terrour to them
that doe evill, and a praiſe, a guard
and defenſe, for them that doe well.


Your poore Oratour at the throne
of grace, that earneſtly prayeth,
that the Lord will give you, and
the great Councell of the Kingdome,
wiſdome and prudence,
to beare with tender Conſciences,
that deſire to exalt Jeſus the
Chriſt in all his Royall Offices,

FRAN. CORNWELL.

Orpington, in Kent,
the ninth Month,
