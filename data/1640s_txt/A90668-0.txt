To my worthily honored Friend, Sir Paul Pindar, Knight.

SIR,


SAint Paul having deſcended lately to view Italy, and other places, as you may trace him in the following Diſcourſe, He would not take his flight backe to Heaven before he had given you a viſit, who have ſo well deſerved of his Church here, the goodlieſt pile of ſtones in Chriſtendome of that kinde.
Of all the men of our times, you are one of the greateſt Examples of Piety and ſolid Integrity, which diſcovers a noble ſoule to dwell within you; ſo that, me thinks, I ſee Saint Paul ſaluting and ſolacing you, that thoſe conſtant works of Charity you daily doe (and them in ſuch a manner, that the left

hand knowes not what the right doth) will be as a Triumphant Chariot to carry you one day up to Heaven, to partake of the ſame beatitude with Him.

Amongſt thoſe multitudes that honour you, I am one, and have done ſo a long time; and as a ſmall teſtimony hereof, I ſend you this new kinde of Diſcourſe, compoſed lately by a noble Perſonage in Italian, of which Language you are ſo great a Maſter.
For the firſt part of this Diſcourſe, which conſiſts of a kinde of Dialogue 'twixt the two firſt Perſons of the Holy Trinity, there are Examples of that kinde in ſome of the Fathers of the Primitive Church; as Apollinarius, and Nazianzen, and lately Grotius hath the like in his Tragedy of Chriſts Paſſion, which may ſerve to free it from all exception:
So I moſt affectionately kiſſe your hands, and am

Your very humble and ready Servant,
Iames Howell.


Fleet
25. of March.
