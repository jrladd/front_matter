The Hiſtory of the Inquiſition, and particularly o
•
 the Venetian. With the Motives which cauſed that moſt Renowned Common-Wealth of Venice to make divers Ordinances touching this matter.

To the Moſt Renowned Duke of Venice: F. P. V. S. wiſheth all happineſſe.


PERFORMING with all due reverence the command laid on me by your Highneſſe to draw unto a head, and ſet downe in order all matters which concerne the Office of the Inquiſition againſt Hereſie: I have found all things ſo well ordered in times paſt, by the Counſells of this moſt Renowned Common-wealth, that there needeth no other thing to be done, but onely to put together that which on divers occaſions hath beene determined, bringing to paſſe that which was deliberated by the moſt excellent Councell of Ten, and in the yeare 1550. the 22 of November, the 8 Chap. vid. that throughout all the Venetian Dominion ſhould bee an uniforme

proceeding, and conformable to what is obſerved within this renowned City: As alſo it was agreed upon betweene Pope Julius the third, and this moſt illuſtrious Common-Wealth, in the yeare 1551. Chap. 18. 19.
Which in my reſpectfull opinion may eaſily be done, if the orders made upon ſeverall occaſions be reduced unto Chapters, and thence as it were a recapitulation framed, wherein ſhall briefly and ſummarily be ſet downe ſo much as is neceſſary to be obſerved, and Copies may be given either of the Heads alone, or joyned with the aforeſaid determination it ſhall ſeeme beſt.
I will firſt gather the Heads, then will I adde the conſiderations and cauſes for which theſe Orders were firſt eſtabliſhed to the Honour of God; for the which it is alſo neceſſary to continue the keeping of them, for the maintenance of holy Religion, and publicke quietneſſe.
