TO The Right Honourable, and my very good LORD, FERDIN ANDO LORD FAIREFAX Baron of CAMERONE.


Right Honourable;


THe Preſſe being now to rectefie ſome peices of mine, formerly miſ-recorded, I have likewiſe added this old Elegie, and long rack'd up in darkneſse; dedicating it thus with all propriety, ſince as relating to that imcomparable HELD, GUSTAVUS

ADOLPHUS, what name among all our moderne Worthyes, has ſo neerely followed, into the ſpur of his triumphant Chariot, as that my good Lord, which both your ſelfe, and yours, have ſo brightn'd with many glorious ſucceſſes. If either the ſtile be quarrel'd, for high, and difficult; or perhaps the method, as over-fancied, and unuſuall; yet when to handle ſuch a conquering, ſuch a covering Cherub, what if invention ſtraine ſomewhat beyond it ſelfe; nay though expreſſions alſo be ſtrange, and even ſometimes prepoſterous, yet was that labor improbus of the Latins, a very pathetical peice of rhetorick; and thus alſo was Godfrey of Bulleines mettle upon mettle, ſuch an elegant ſoeliciſme, as ſaid him able to refine the moſt ſtain and, to the moſt honourable bearing. Let it not therefore

intercept your favourable allowance, if I have taken an untroden path, where the common roade was diſproportionable; and yet againe, you may pleaſe to receive the tender graciouſly, as being free from all unworthy reſpects; and with much candor, intending only a diſcharg of that duty, which all good men owe your reall nobleneſſe; amongſt whom, and ſuch as ſhall ever ayme at your commands, no one more affectionately deſires to be listed, then

Your Lordſhips moſt humble Servant,
GEORGE TOOKE.
