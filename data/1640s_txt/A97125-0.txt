TO THE
HONOVRABLE
Houſe of COMMONS
Aſſembled in Parliament.

AT your Command this Sermon
was Preached, by
your Order it hath been
Printed, and now its
humbly offered to your
hands, and under your
Honourable Patronage made Publque to
the view of the world. I know well that
the ſame Sermon, as to the life of it, is
ſcarcely the ſame in the hearing, and in the
reading: But that acceptation which it
found when it came frō the Pulpit, gives

me hope that it will not be caſt aſide, as
diſreliſhing or unprofitable; now its
come from the Preſſe. The Lord command
a bleſsing along with it unto you,
and make you and your unwearied labours,
a bleſsing to the Church and Kingdome.
So prays
Your moſt unworthy ſervant
in the work of the Miniſterie.
IOHN WARD.
