TO THE HONORABLE THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, AND Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.

Moſt Renowned Worthies,


THis Antiteichiſma ſtands under high Protection fortified. Oppoſition it had, and ſhall have ſtill. But your honour advanceth Truth, and nothing more. Nothing hath beene more obſcured is ſeene, and how. Age doth not, cannot wrinckle her. Where the clouds of Sophiſtry be diſpelled, her Face ſhines with beauty. To begin this

beliefe, J publiſhed this. The common charmes of ſuperſtition take not me. Whereat J aime, the marke is hit. J beſeech you embolden me, and I can ſpeake plaine. Whileſt the cloſe followers of Truth and Peace are purſued, the two ſacred Siſters be forced by Humoriſts. And ſo impetuouſly, as if their being preſent were the preſent being of incendiaries. A ſtrange Paradiastole: obſerve it, I have done. Be You ever under the divine influence, and J

the humbleſt of your Servants, THO. BARTON.
