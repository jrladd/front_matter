To the much and worthily Honoured
Sr. ROBERT HARLEY
Knight of the Honourable Order of
the Bath, and Knight of the Honourable
House of Commons for the
County of He
•
eford.

THe desire I had to professe
my devoted Service to the
pious designes of your honourable
Senate, disposed
me to a boldnesse of offering
this ensuing Discourse
by a generall Dedication to your whole
House. But my judgement (upon second cogitations)
gave check to that conceit, as making
too neare an approach, towards some
presumption, and directed me to value it, below
the rate of a competent Present, for so
many, so worthy persons of your Assembly, and
to select some Patron among you for a singular
inscription. Thence were my thoughts
conducted to your Selfe (noble Sir) to whom

(for your prudent and constant Zeale, to advance
all just and conscionable causes, and
your many affectionate expressions of respect
to me both present and absent) I held my selfe
obliged to take this opportunity, to tender a
token of a gratefull memory of such favour as
(without the guilt of ungratitude) I can neither
forget nor forbear to acknowledge. And I
should be as ungodly as ungratefull, if (considering
your intentive incumbency upon the
common cares of the Church and Sta
•
e) I
should not (both in Church and Closet) addresse
my heartiest devotions to the Lord Almighty,
to preserve your person (with the
rest of your venerable Associates) and to prosper
your consultations with such happy successe, as
m
•
y occasion an exchange of prayers into praises.
In both which sacred Services (with reference
to you and yours, in neerest relations)
none shall be more sincere and serious then he
who will never be wanting,


Great Budworth, Septem. 20. 1641.

Vnfainedly to honour and faithfully to serve you JOHN LEY.
