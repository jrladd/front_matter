To the Right HONORABLE Sir JOHN GAYR Knight, LORD MAJOR: The Right Worshipfull the Sheriffs, and the rest of the Aldermen. Together with the Worshipfull Societies of this Ancient and most Renowmed City of LONDON.

Right Honorable, Right Worshipfull; Worshipfull:


I Should have been well pleased to have kept this scarce plumed Bird in my private Cage, had not the noyse of some virulent Fowlers shot forced her to flye abroad for Refuge; where to build her Nest better she knew not, then in the secure clefts of your favourable protection. In

your eares she first sounded her notes, which (though harsh and broken) were attentively heard by many among you; and I hope will now be entertained no lesse acceptably.
True it is, she is no soaring Eagle in cloudy Notions, nor gaudy Peacock beautified with the Feathers of affected Eloquence: onely thus much I may safely say, shee is an harmless Dove, free from the Gall of Malicious Bitterness, bringing in her mouth like that of NOAHS, the Olive Branch of peacefull Vnity. To the effecting and establishing whereof, that shee may prove in some measure subservient, is the hearty desire and unfeigned prayer of him who is


A constant Petitioner at the Throne of Grace for yours, and the Churches safety. Nathanael Hardy.
