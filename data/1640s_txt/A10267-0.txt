TO
THE MVCH HONORED
LADY, AND MY
MOST DEARE SISTER
MARY
Lady Quarles,
Late Wife of Sir Robert Quarles of
Romford, Knight, Deseased.

Madam,


MY beloved Brother, your deare
Husband, had a name (purchased
by his owne worth)
which needed the helpe of no
quill, either to perpetuate or
vindicate it: But Affection will be doing.
Losers may chalenge leave to speake, and
it is a ventall vanity to repeate that losse,
which admits no recovery. A busie hand
will blow, although the fire burne: But

let the world excuse the Tautology
of my affection, and know there is a
secret cause that bred these lines,
which I had rather should bee imagined
then revealed: However Madam,
one of my ends are to comfort you,
who have made your selfe a prisoner
to your sorrowes, and whose blessings
I desire may bee multiplyed by
your teares. Let your confidence of his
happinesse moderate the extremity of
your mourning, lest all that loved
him beginne to mourne for you: Madam
I present you with the Abstract
of his story, for your affection to
enlarge, which I recommend as a president
for his Children to follow. Lesse
I could not, and more I cannot doe,
to testifie the deare remembrance I
owe his ashes, and the true love I
beare his memory, for whose sake and

yours, your Ladishippe shall ever bee
beloved, and truely honoured by
Your most affectionate Brother,
Fra: Quarles.
