To the Honourable House of Commons, now assembled in Parliament.

IT pleased this Honourable Assembly to require my service in preaching at the late solemne and religious afflicting your soules before the Lord, to which not only my duty but experience of your former acceptance of my endeavours, made me yeeld a ready obedience. But although I knew your goodnesse would beare with that weaknesse which would be discovered in speaking to so grave and judicious an auditory; yet could I not expect to receive so large a testimony, not only of your acceptation, but thanks, as I and my Colleague have done, much lesse that you should so expresly send to have them published; because now what blame shall be cast upon my insufficiency in handling and prosecuting such a subject, must in some sort reflect upon your selves. For my selfe I answer all objections against my sending them abroad, with this, that they are yours, and it is fit for me to yeeld unto your disposing of them.
For the maine lesson handled, the Lord grant that our seeking him while he may be found, may prevent us from being a further proofe of it to other Nations, and succeeding generations.
And to this end, the same Lord guide and blesse unto



us, and reward into your owne bosomes, and your posterities, all the many, long, and unwearied labours which you have undergone, and still continue in for the glory of his name, the reformation of his Church, the honour of his Majesty, the peace and prosperity of the whole Realme. This is so generally desired and sought for at Gods hands, that I hope the God who heareth prayers, will not leave the happinesse imperfect, which he seemes to have prepared by your meanes, nor deprive us of the good which you are working. To his wisedome, protection, mercy, and grace, he leaves you, who is your daily Remembrancer at the Throne of Grace.

STEPHEN MARSHALL.
