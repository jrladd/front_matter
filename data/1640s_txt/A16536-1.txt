TO THE NOBLE LADY, D. Anne Campbell; Daughter to the Noble and Potent Earle, the Earle of Argyle, &c.


MADAME,



I
 Heere humbly dedicate unto your Ladiship, now of tender yeeres these two compends of the Catechisme.
Saint Iohn, the Cusin, and beloved Disciple of Iesus Christ, who for his high doctrine was compared to an Eagle that mounteth very high, disdained not to write unto Children. In one chapter of a short Epistle hee hath▪
I write unto you little children;1 Joh. 2 12▪
vers. 13 and againe in the same words, I write unto you little children; of that his writing

hee giveth two reasons; the one is in these words, because your sins are forgiven you for his Names sake; the other reason is in these words, because yee have knowne the Father: For this end, Madame, have I written unto you these two compends, that yee may know the Father; whom I most humbly intreat to increase his graces begun in your Ladyship in a good measure▪


From Glasgow
the 19. of Ianuar, 1639.

Your Ladiships most humble Servant, M. ZACHARY BOYD.
