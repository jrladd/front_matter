•
RFAX Knight, Generall of all the Forces raiſed, by the PARLIAMENT, againſt the Popiſh and Malignant Party.

Moſt meritoriouſly Honourable,


THE many late Glorious Trophies and Vnparalel'd Succeſſes, wherewith the Lord of Hoſts hath been graciouſly pleaſed to Crowne Your cordiall Military Vndertakings, to the Admiration of all Your Friends, the Aſtoniſhment, Confuſion of all the publike Malignant Enemies of Our Churches, Kingdomes Tranquility; as they have engaged the Parliament, (with all parts of the Realme under their Command) to return publike Solemn Prayſes unto God, for ſundry Succesſive Victories, over puiſſant Armies in the Field, and Conqueſts of divers Strong-holds, atcheived by Your indefatigable Induſtry, Incomparable valour, through Gods blesſing on them: ſo it hath ſpecially obliged Me, as to render particular Thankeſgiving unto God, ſo to tender ſome ſmall apparent Monument of my Obligations and Gratitude to Your ſelfe, whom God hath highly honoured to all poſterity, in making You an happy Inſtrument of redeeming my Native Country (Sommerſetſhire) with the adjacent Counties, out of the devouring Jawes of the oppresſing Enemy, and of reviving, recovering our lost dying Kingdome even at its loweſt Ebbe, in a time of greateſt need, with ſo great

Celerity, ſo little effuſion of Engliſh Blood on either ſide; Which I knew not, for the preſent, how more viſibly to expreſſe, then by preſenting Your Honour with this briefe P
•

lemicall Ʋindication, in defect of a Richer Preſent.

It was my great undemerited Happineſſe, and your Generous Humility (at Your firſt arivall in London from the North, to undertake the Chiefe Command of the Parliaments Forces) to ſtoop ſo far below Your ſelfe, as to honour Me with Your voluntary ſweet Acquaintance and Diſcourſe; which emboldens me to crave this further Favour, to dignifie this rude 
Ʋindication, with your Noble Acceptation, of ſo Small unpoliſhed a Piece; whoſe Subject matter (Church Diſcipline) is of ſo Great concernment, that the Settlement thereof according to Gods Word, and the Pureſt times▪
 is one principle end of Your and Our taking up Defenſive Armes.

I ſhall not be ſo injurious to the State or You, to interrupt Your weighty Military Affaires, or retard Your Admirable Expeditions with my unſeaſonable Lines. I ſhall rather become a dayly Orator to the Lord of Hoſts, ſo far to multiply the weekely Catalogues of Your ſuceſſefull Conqueſts, that You may ere long return to the Great Counſell and Metropolis of our Realme in a Triumphant Chariot, with this Honourable victorious Motto, engraven in golden Characters on Your Helmet; This is the Generall whom the Lord hath honoured to be, next under him, The ſpeedy Finiſher of our long protracted Civil Wars; And happy Reſtorer of our Long-deſired Peace: Which is and ſhall be the Prayer of

Your Honours moſt Devoted Friend and Servant WILLIAM PRYNNE.
