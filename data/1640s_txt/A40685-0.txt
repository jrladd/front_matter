TO THE HONORABLE and truly noble Sr. JOHN D'ANVERS Knight.

Sir,


THis smal Sermon may well bee termed Zoar, for is it not a little one? Yet it bears good proportion to the short text; on which it discourseth;

little auditory for which it was composed, and your private Chappel wherin it was delivered. As it is smal, so it desired to be secret, and intended no appearance in publike. Good was the counsel which Iaash gave Amaziah. 2 Cro. 25. 19. Abide now at home, especially in our dangerous dayes, when all going,

is censurable for gadding abroad without a necessary vocation.
But seeing such was your importunitie, to have it Printed, that all my excuses to the contrary, which I could alledge with truth, and the delays, which I could make with manners, might not prevaile: I have chosen rather to be accounted

undiscreet then uncivil, and have yeelded to your desire. Surely Sir, Heaven can never return a denial to your requests whom I presume, (by proportion of your earnest desiring so smal a matter) to be zealous in your desires of hier concernment, that nothing but a grant can give you satisfaction.
But the mainest

motive, next your importunity, which put me on this publike adventure, was the consideration of my engagements to your noble bounty, above my possibility of deserving it. The Apostle with it is part of the duty of a good servant, Tit. 2. v. 9. 
〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
, not answering againe. I must confesse my selfe your Servant, and

therefore it ill beseemed me to dislike or mutter against any thing you was pleased I should doe. Thus desiring the continuance and increase of all spiritual and temporal happines on your honour. I commend you to the Almighty.

T. F.
