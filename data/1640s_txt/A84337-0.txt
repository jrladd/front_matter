To all the friends of the Bridegroom, the White-rayment Chriſtians, and citizens of the New Jeruſalem.


DEare and faithfull Brethren, Mr. Brightman fore-propheſied of a Church to ariſe, that ſhould be the Woman clothed with the Sun, which ſhould glitter on every ſide round about, with the moſt cleer light of the Scripture, of the Sun of righteouſneſſe, in the doctrine of juſtification (as you may ſee, on Rev. 19. 17. and chap. 12. 1.) with the cleer knowledge whereof, ſhe being adorned, as it were, with a goodly garment, came forth abroad, and laid her ſelf open to the view of the world. And Reſt (ſaith hee) ſhall be the naturall daughter of the woman, clothed with the Sun, (meaning a ſpirituall reſt) which are the moſt entire and chaſte Congregation of all the reſt, (yet no Sect) which above others ſhine with this glorious aray; And it ſeemeth, (ſaith he) that all the chief ſtreſſe and violence of the laſt battell in the Weſt, ſhall be turned againſt that holy Congregation, which we ſaid right now, to ſtand glittering in the Sun, which are the hill of precious fruits, and the mountain full of holy pleaſures, of which God maketh more account thenSee 2 Eſdr. 7. 26. 34, 35. See 2 Eſdr. 6. 28. of all delight ſome things in the world. Now you white rayment Chriſtians, are this woman, clothed with the Sun; for you all believe that you are clothed with the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, and ſtand in him before God: Here is an Ax for you; for the bleſſing of Joſhua belongs to you, which he ſpake to the children of Joſeph. Thou art a great people, and haſt great power, therefore the mountain ſtall be thine, for it is a wood, and thou ſhalt cut it down, and the ends of it ſhall be thine, and thou ſhalt caſt out the Canaanites, though they have iron Chariots, and though they be ſtrong, J
•
ſh 17. So here are mountains of ſins, errors and falſe religions, in England and Ireland, it is a wood of Sects, Schiſmes and Hereſies, but thou haſt cut them down, for thou art a great people, and haſt great power (with the Lord in prayer) and England ſhall be thine, and thou ſhalt caſt out the Canaanites of ſin, Idolatry, and falſe Religions, though they have Ordnance of iron, and though they be ſtrong, lay this Ax of the Law to the root of them; and ſhew them, that now alſo every tree, i. Religion, Church, Sect, or man, that bringeth forth ſin before God, (Iſai. 1. 16.) is hewn down and caſt into the fire of God wrath, for the wrath of God is now revealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe of men, which withhold truth in unrighteouſneſſe (Rom. 1. 18) for the hour of temptation is come, to try them that are upon the face of the earth, Rev. 2. 10. in which friends ſhall fight with friends, as with enemies, and the earth ſhalll fear with

them, 2 Eſdr. 6. 22. when there ſhall be ſeen an earth-quake in the world, and an up

See 2 Eſd 16. 10, 11. 14, 15. 19. 5. 33. 8. 46. viſit the world which he made, 2 Eſdra. 9. 4. & 3 hard it is for men to keep faith and a good conſcience now, yea, the ſtrongeſt faith ſhall finde it difficult. Would not you be glad to be delivered from this hour of temptation? and were it not labour worth the pains, to ſhew that you ſhall be delivered? And though all evill trees ſhall be cut down with the a

Come forth, come forth thou Kings daughter, all glorious within, all light in the Lord, the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, ſhew thy ſelf to the world, thy garments are of broydered gold, Pſal. 45. 13. that is, of the merits of Chriſt crucified, death and reſurrection, given you freely in your Baptiſme into Chriſts death, for remiſſion of ſins, Rom. 6. 3, 4, Acts 2. 38. and are made glorious in the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, that is riſen upon you, Mal. 2. 4. ſhew your ſelves to the world, for the ſtreſſ

ell in the Weſt (you heare) ſhall be againſt you, but you ſhall overcome by faith, 1 John 5 4. when the ax ſhall cut down the wicked, yet fear not; you are got into the Sun, and therefore are out of gun-ſhot for your ſouls, yet put on the whole armour of God, Eph. 6. 14. and gird up the loynes of your mindes, with the girdle of verity, and put on the breſt-plate of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; and above all, take the ſhield of faith in your Baptiſme, and in the blood of the Lamb, wherewith you may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helm

er, and ſupplications, in the Spirit that teſtifieth of the water and blood of Chriſt, for remiſſion of your ſins, and you ſhall overcome: For you have a ſtrong city, (of the new Jeruſalem) ſalvation ſhallAll that get into this city are ſafe. God ſet for wa
•
ls and bulwarks, Iſai. 26. 1. open ye the gates of it, Rev. 22. 14. that you the righteous nation, that keep the truth, ma
•
 enter in; for by an aſſured purpoſe, will Chriſt preſerve perfect peace for you, becauſe you truſted in him verſ. 3 O truſt in the Lord Jeſus for ever, for in the Lord (our righteouſneſſe, Jer. 23. 6.) is ſtrength for evermore, verſ. 4. for he will bring down them that dwell on high, that fight againſt you, the high city (of Rome) will he abaſe even unto the ground, and bring it unto the duſt, v. 5. that your fee
•
 ſhall tread it down, and all doctrine of infidelity. I call you White-rayment Chriſtians; if any ask my reaſons, they are theſe:
Firſt, becauſe you are the few names in Laodicca, of England, (as well as in Sardis) that have not defiled your garments, (
•
 by a falſe faith, or raigning ſin) therefore you ſhall walk with Chriſt in white. for you are worthy, Rev 3. 4.M
•
. Mi. Con. M
•
. Mi. Con.

Secondly, whoſoever overcomes, ſhall be clo
•
hed with white rayment, ſaith Chriſt. Rev. 3. 5. but you have overcome, 1 John 4. 4. Ergo, you ſhall be clothed with i
•
, and therefore ſhall be white-rayment Chriſtians: for whomſoever Chriſt ſaith ſhall be clothed with white rayment, I may truly call a white-rayment Chriſtian; but you overcommers are they, that Chiſt ſaith ſhall be clothed with white rayment, E
•
go, I may truly call you white-rayment Chriſtians.


Thirdly, whoſoever have bought of Chriſt white rayment, that he may beMa. clothed, that the ſhame of his nakedneſſe may not appear, may be called a white-rayment Chriſtian, becauſe he hath bought it, Rev.

•
. 18. But you areMi. Con. Ma. Mi. Con. Ma. they, Ergo. Again, whoſoever watcheth, and keepeth Chriſts garments that are white, as (Rev 3. 18.) leſt hee walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame, is a bleſſed white-rayment Chriſtian, as Rev. 16. 15. But you are ſuch, Ergo, you are bleſſed white-rayment Chriſtians.

Alſo you are citizens of the new Jeruſalem; for on whomſoever Chriſt will write upon, the name of the city of my God, the new Jeruſalem, which cometh down from my God out of heaven, Rev. 3. 12. ſhall rightly be called a citizen of the new Jeruſalem; but on you that have overcome, Chriſt will write theMi. Con. name of the new Jeruſalem, Rev 3. 12. Ergo, you ſhall be called citizens of the new Jeruſalem.

This was ſpoken to Philadelphia, not to us of Laodicea. I anſwer, whatſoeverObject. was ſpoken to any one of the ſeven Churches, runs into the laſt: for let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches, Rev. 3. it ſaith it to you, overcommers in Laodicea, in England, for, what I ſay to you, I ſay to all, Marke 13. Now concerning the Philadelphians, that were admoniſhed by Chriſt, to hold faſt that they had, that no man take their crown, Rev. 3. 11. I gather the Philadelphians being admoniſhed, to hold it faſt, ſhould loſe it, for if man muſt hold faſt a crown, he will loſe it, and that the La
•
d ceans ſhould take it from them; for the white-rayment Chriſtians that have overcome, and taken Chriſts counſell, Rev. 3. 18. ſhall take their crown from them, to be called, firſt citizens of the new Jeruſalem; And you ſhall take the crown from the Lutheranes▪
 (becauſe they defiled their garments, and their works were not perfect before God, Rev 3. 2, & 3.) and ſhall be called firſt White rayment Chriſtians.

Secondly, whoſoever is come to the celeſtiall Jeruſalem, and to be citizensMa. Mi. with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, are citizens of the new Jeruſalem; but by the blood of Chriſt in Baptiſme, and by faith, Eph. 2. 13. Rev. 1. 5. you are come to the celeſtiall Jeruſalem, Heb 12. 22. and to be citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, Epheſ. 2. 19. Ergo, you are citizens ofCon. the mew Jeruſalem; therefore call your ſelves no more the Church of England, or of the Lu
•
herans, or the like, for they are ſhaken, and ſhall be removed, Heb. 12. 27. but call your ſelves White-rayment Chriſtians, and citizens of the new Jeruſalem, for you ſee God calls you ſo. Now your city is of pure gold, like cleer glaſſe, Rev. 21. 18. for your city of the new Jeruſalem, is built of pure gold, that Chriſt hath counſelled you to buy of him, Rev 3. 18. which is the lively faith, in the merit
•
 of Chriſts death. in our baptiſme, for remiſſion of ſins, (Acts 2. 38.) in the firſt love of Chriſt, (not of ſuch as have taken a new baptiſme, and ſo forſaken their firſt love of Chriſt, as the Church of Epheſus did, and therefore the candleſtick of the Church was removed out of their place, Rev. 2. 5. becauſe they tooke a ſecond baptiſme, and forſook their firſt, for which cauſe, the Councel of Nice made it an Article of their Creed (I believe one Baptiſme, for the remiſſion of ſins) and it is like cleer glaſſe, becauſe through this golden glaſſe of your baptiſme, wherein you were waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor. 6. 1
•
. you may ſee the face of God through it, what a reconciled,

mercifull, and loving Father he is to you, that hath ſealed a new Covenant to you, to become your father, and you his children, and that your ſins and iniquities ſhall be remembred no more, Heb. 8. 12. and you may ſee through thisHebr. 8. glaſſe of your baptiſme, the face of Jeſus, what a bleſſed, meek, and loving Saviour he is to you, that hath loved you, and gave himſelf for you, (Gal. 2. 20.) and waſhed you from your ſins, in his own blood, and made you Kings and Prieſts to God his Father, Epheſ. 5. 25. Rev. 1. 5. and you may ſee as in a glaſſe, (1 Cor. 13. 12▪) what a bleſſed, holy, and ſweet Comforter you have, that hath waſhed you in the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt, Titus 3. 5. And the ſtreet of your city is of pure gold, like to tranſparent glaſſe, Rev. 21. 21. O walk in this golden ſtreet, for it is tranſparent, like perſpective glaſſe; for, as he that hath a good perſpective glaſſe may ſee far off, ſo may you, even your ſins, ſet as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, Pſal. 103. 12. Peter complaineth2 Pet. 1. 9. of many that are blind, and cannot ſee far off, becauſe they have forgotten their baptiſme, wherein they were waſhed from their old ſins; they have forgotten this tranſparent glaſſe. But all you citizens of the new Jeruſalem, walk in this golden ſtreet of your baptiſme, it is a perſpective glaſſe; and as in a perſpective glaſſe, men look through two glaſſes, ſo in this there are two glaſſes, the firſt is made of the pure river, of the water of life, cleer as Cryſtall, which is the pure water of baptiſme, Heb. 10. 23. the ſecond is the blood of theRev. 22. 1. Lamb; both theſe meet in one, look through them both together, and anoint your eyes with eye-ſalve of the Spirit, and you ſhall ſee far off, even into heaven, and behold Chriſt to be your wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption, 1 Cor. 1. 30. and your bleſſedneſſe, happineſſe, holineſſe, eternall life, everlaſting glory, immortality; yea, thou may ſee thy name written in heaven: through this golden cleer glaſſe of thy baptiſme, which thou receivedſt in thine Infancy, and now walk in this golden ſtreet by faith, you may be aſſured, and rejoyce, that your names are written in heaven, Luke 10. 20. Queſt. How know you that? Anſw. There be three which beare record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, theſe three are one, and beare record in heaven, that he hath given you a new name, Rev. 2. 17. in baptiſme, for all your names were Adam before, Gen. 5. 2. but they beare record, that he hath given you a new name and his own new name, Rev. 3. 12. And there be three which bear record in earth, the Spirit, and water, and blood, theſe three agree in one, that your names are written in heaven; for to whomſoeverMa. Mi. Con. God hath given eternall life, which life is in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, his name is written in heaven. But the three in heaven, and the three in earth, do bear witneſſe, that he hath given you eternall life, 1 John 5. 7, 8. 11. Ergo, your names are written in heaven, that believe it on this ground, and you are let into Paradiſe again; for though Adam, and all his children, were ſhut out of it, and the Cherubim with a flaming ſword, which turned every way, to keep the tree of life, Gen. 3. which ſignifieth this axe of the fiery Law, Deut. 33. 2▪
See 2 Eſdra 8. 52, 53, 54, to 63. given by Angels (Acts▪
 7. 53.) keepeth every man from the Paradiſe, of aſſurance of ſalvation; for this axe of the Law cuts men off, and ſhuts them out, every way, for originall or actuall ſins, mans merits, or humane righteouſneſſe; whoſoever hath but one ſin is cut down by the Law. But by your baptiſme into Chriſt, you are let into Paradiſe again, and have now right and title by

your baptiſme, and by faith, to eat of all the trees in the garden, i. title to all things to be yours, and you are Chriſts, 1 Cor. 3. And you may eate of the tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, Rev. 2. 7. that is, of Chriſt in the Supper, and be more ſure of eternall life, then the tree of life could have made Adam, and ſhall be kept in the Paradiſe of Gods protection: For thus ſaith the Lord, Becauſe you have kept the word of my patience, I will deliver thee from the hour of temptation, that is come upon all the world, to try them that are upon the face of the earth, Rev. 3. 10. Now, what is the word of Chriſts patience, but the faith of baptiſme into Chriſt crucified, for the remiſſion of our ſins? for the word of Chriſts patience, is the faith in Chriſt crucified, which Paul deſired only to know, 1 Cor. 2. Now what is a man the better, to1 Cor. 2. 2. ſay, I believe Chriſt was crucified, dead and buried, except he keep the faith of it for remiſſion of his ſins? for the devills believe ſo much. But the word of Chriſts patience, which you keep, is this, that you ſay, and believe, that I am in him that is true, in that his Son Jeſus Chriſt, 1 John 5. 20. in whom I am crucified, and dead, and buried, and riſen again with Chriſt in my baptiſme, into Chriſts death, for the remiſſion of ſins, and have put on Chriſt, Rom. 6. 
•
, 4 Col. 2. 12. Gal. 3. 27. That Church that keeps the word of Chriſts patience, i. faith in their baptiſme into Chriſts death, for remiſſion of ſins (though they knew not what Chriſt did for them, when he waſhed them, as he told Peter, John 1
•
. but know it afterward) ſhall be delivered from this houre of temptation; but all other religious plants, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted out. The axe of the Law cuts them off, for one ſin before God; but he that is holy, and true (ſaith) be that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, Mark 16. 16. (that is, he that believeth one baptiſme into Chriſt, for remiſſion of ſins, ſhall be ſaved) but he that believeth not his one baptiſme into Chriſt for remiſſion of his ſins, ſhall be damned, as Heathens, Turks, Jews, Witches and Apoſtates, that have denied it: For thisNicen Creed. Athanaſius. is the Catholike faith, I believe one Baptiſme for the remiſſion of ſins, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved, the axe cut them off. Now when men have loſt this Paradiſe, then they muſt go till the earth, full of falſe religions, all ſerve an angry God. The Heathen run to Jupiter, the Turks to Mahumet, the Jewes to Moſes ceremonies, the Papiſts to Saints, to Pilgrimage, a wilderneſſe and Purgatory: Lo, here is Chriſt, ſay the Papiſts, in the Popes chaire, and pardon: Lo, here is Chriſt, ſay the Luberans, in conſubſtantiation; and lo, here is Chriſt, ſay the Anabaptiſts, in our new Jordan, and yet it carries them into the lake Aſphaltes, mare mortuum, the dead ſea, for he that denieth his firſt baptiſme, to take a ſecond, it is a dead and damnable ſin, as Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. and Heb 10. 29. 
•
5. 38. Lo, there, ſay all ſects, in our Church way, and yet never a one of them have aſſurance of ſalvation, becauſe they have not faith in one baptiſme, for remiſſion of ſins, for no man can have the knowledge of ſalvation, but by the remiſſion of ſins, as Luke 1. 77. Well, you ſee the houre of temptation is come, a flood of judgements flow upon earth for ſin. Here is an axe for you, to cut down ſin, and an ark for you white-rayment Chriſtians, and citizens of the new Jeruſalem, namely, the ark of our baptiſme into Chriſts death, for remiſſion of ſins. It hath been building in England about an hundred yeeres, you only have God ſeen righteous in this generation, an

end of all falſe religions is come, and God will deſtroy them with the earthly men: Enter you, your wives, and your children, into the faith of this Ark,Gen. 6. but leave not your children out of this Ark, nor take a new one; for that is curſed, Gal. 1. 8, 9. For, as the Ark ſaved Noah, ſo 
〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
, the ſame Antitype which now ſaveth us, Baptiſme, (the tranſlators were to blame, to call it a figure, for there is as much difference between a figure and an antitype, as between the brazen Serpent and Chriſt, 1 Pet. 3. 21.) meaning of the inward Baptiſme. Now, as you know many before the flood might come into the A
•
k, and look upon it, and yet, becauſe they did not abide in it, they all periſhed: So now a 
•
lood of Gods judgements are come in this hour of temptation, and many people have ſeen baptiſme, and been within it ſacramentally, but all that do not ſtay in it by faith, ſhall periſh. Therefore little children, abide in him (that were ſhut or graffed into him by one baptiſme) that when he ſhall appeare, we may be bold, (1 Iohn 2 28.) for behold, Chriſt ſtandeth at the dore, and knocks, in Laodicca in England (and he will not leave knocking with judgements, till they take his counſell, Rev. 3. 18.) if any man will heare my voyce, (ſaith he) and open the dore, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me. You ſee Chriſt raps loud with the ſword and cannons, and he will knock with an earth-quake, and with peſtilence, Luke 21. 11. In England and Scotland, where are Saints, with the ſword and peſtilence, but in Ireland, where are moſt Idolaters, with ſword and famine: reaſons I give in a book to come out, in Chriſts knock at the dores of England. Now, is it not good letting of Chriſt in to ſup with us, and we with him, when hee knocks, and calls to us to take his counſel? to buy of him gold to make us rich, in the lively faith of the merits of Chriſts death, in baptiſme, for a perfect remiſſion of ſins, (for he likes not this lukewarm, lame remiſſion of ſins to halfes, which many profeſſe) and white-rayment juſtification to cloath us, that the ſhame of our nakedneſſe may not appeare, and eye-ſalve of the Spirit that takes of Jeſus, water and blood, to witneſſe to your ſpirits, you are the children of God, Rom. 8. 17. that thou mayſt ſee, Rev. 3. 18. Chriſt will not leave rebuking, and chaſtiſing England, and knocking, till they heare, and let him in. Now therefore, let the loynes (of your minds) be girt about (with verity) and your lamps (of faith) burning, Luke 12. 35. and ye your ſelves, like men that wait for their Maſter, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately: Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find waking, i. in the wedding garment; Verily I ſay unto you, he will gird himſelf about, and will make them ſit down at table, and will come forth, and ſerve them; and if he come at the ſecond watch, or in the third watch, and find them ſo, bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, verſ. 36, 37. Now, you bleſſed White-rayment Chriſtians, underſtand, that Chriſt our Maſter, is now returning from the wedding; for I believe not any more Churches of the Gentiles, (before the marriage of the Lamb, to the Iews) ſhall be called, and the third watch is come, and the dawning of the day of the Iews is at hand, and our Maſter now knocketh, the dinner of the wedding of the Gentiles, hath laſted about 1623. for the marriage of the Gentiles, was called a dinner, Mat. 22. 4. and the marriage dinner was furniſhed with gueſts of good and bad, for all had

not a wedding garment, and therefore bad. Now, as noble Bridegrooms often times will bid a multitude to dinner, but none but his ſpeciall friends are bidden to ſupper; So Chriſt, the moſt noble Bridegroom, hath bidden ſeven Churche
•
 of the Gentiles to the dinner of the marriage, and now he is returning from the wedding of the Gentiles, and he knocks and calls, Rev. 3. 20.Rev. 3. 20. Bleſſed are you that let him in immediately, for he calls for you, his friends, the White rayment Chriſtians, to come to ſupper. Give me leave to ſhew you, the friends of the Bridegroom, why Chriſt now knocks, and calls in England; it is to call you to ſupper, all that were bidden to the wedding-dinner: were not bleſſed: But now (he ſaith) write, Bleſſed are they that are bidden to the marriage ſupper of the Lamb; theſe are the true ſayings of God, Rev. 19. 9. The wedding-dinner is paſt, and Chriſt is returning from the wedding, as Luke 12. 36. and behold, he ſtandeth at the dore, and knocks in England, with the ſword and peſtilence, let him in; for it ſeems, ſome have not let him yet; ſay, it is the voyce of my well beloved that knocks, ſaying, Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled, for mine head is full of dew, and my locks with the drops of the night, Cant. 5. 2. for men that are let in, uſe not to knock, but thoſe that are ſhut out. Chriſt is about to marry his wife, of the Iewes, that ſhall make her ſelf ready by baptiſme and faith, and he will grant to her to be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure, 
〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
, the juſtifications of the Saints, Rev. 19. 8. And now Chriſt knocks at the dore in England. to call his friends, to go with him to the marriage-ſupper, with his wife, and will begin his ſupper in England, he will ſup with them, Rev. 3. 20. The moſt rareſt junkets are kept for the marriage-ſupper. Now therefore heark; hee ſayes, I will ſup with him (that lets me in) and he with me; ſee how Eſdras propheſied of you, 2 Eſdras 2. 38. Ariſe and ſtand up, and behold the number of thoſe that are ſealed for the feaſt of the Lord, which are departed from the ſhadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the Lord: Take thy number, O Sion, and ſhut up them that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the Law of the Lord. Here you ſee, he propheſied of you White-rayment Chriſtians, ſealed for the feaſt, as Chriſt doth, Rev. 3. 4. & 18. & 16. 15. Now therefore all you, that have put on Chriſt in infant-baptiſme, Gal. 3. 27. and made your long robes white in the blood of the Lamb, as my Sermon of the blood of the Lamb declares, prepare a ſupper for Chriſt; the cheere muſt be prepared of hearts, My ſon, give me thy heart, and it muſt be broken, and contrite, for he loves no ſtones that will not break, for the ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit, A br
•
ken and a centrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe, Pſal. 51. 17. Secondly, theſe hearts muſt be ſerved in at your ſupper, in gold, that he counſelleth you to buy of him, Rev. 3. 18. which is the lively faith in the merits of Chriſts death, in one baptiſme, for remiſſion of ſins; for thus Peter ſerved in three thouſand hearts that were pricked by the Law, in baptiſme, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſion of ſins, Acts 2. 38. Thirdly, you muſt ſerve it in, in the white-rayment juſtification, wherein no ſhame of nakedneſſe do appeare, for Chriſt cannot endure ſin. Fourthly, you muſt buy eye-ſalve, of the Holy Ghoſt, to anoint your eyes, that you may▪ ſee, Rev. 3. 18. For Chriſt will not ſup with blind ſinners. Fifthly, the marriage-chamber muſt be paved with the

love of the daughters of Ieruſalem, Cant. 3. 10. i. with love to all the citizens of the new Ieruſalem, and now invite him, ſaying, Ariſe thou North-wind, and come thou South, and blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out; let my well beloved come into his garden, and eat of his pleaſant fruits, Cant. 4. Now Chriſt hath prepared a ſupper for you; for thus he ſaith, I am come into my garden, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, I have gathered my myrrbe, with my ſpice, I have eaten mine honey comb, with mine honey, I have drunk my wine, with my milke, eat, O friends, drink and make you merry, O well beloved, (Cant. 5. 1.) for the firſt diſh that you ſhall have at my ſupper, ſaith Chriſt, is the tree of life; for, to him that 
•
vercometh, will I give to eat of the tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, Rev. 2. 7. Eat of Chriſt therefore, the tree of life, at ſupper, and drink his blood, and make you merry. Secondly, you that are faithfull, ſhall have a crown of life, and not be hurt of the ſecond death, Rev 2. 10, 11. Thirdly; you ſhall have the hidden Manna, this is good cheere indeed, Eat, O friends, and make you merry, for you ſhall have a white ſtone, with a new name written, that no man knoweth, ſave he that receiveth it, (yea, no man can underſtand theſe things that I write, but he that hath the white ſtone,) Fourthly, you that are bidden to the marriage-ſupper, ſhall be a conquering people; for you ſhall have power over nations, and rule them with a rod of iron, and break them in pieces like a Potters veſſell, and ſhall have the morning Star, which is Jeſus, the root and the generation of David, to be your light, Rev. 22. 16. and Rev 2. 26. Fifthly, be merry, for you you ſhall be clothed with white-rayment, and he will not blot out your names out of the book of life, Rev. 3. 5. True faith in the White-rayment, is an argument, your names are written in the book of life. Sixthly, be merry in the Lord, for he will make you a pillar in the Temple of God, and you ſhall go no more out; and I will write upon you the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is the new Jeruſalem, which cometh down from my God, out of heaven, and my new name, the new Chriſtian, a new creature, Gal. 6. 16. Seventhly, be merry, for you ſhall fit with Chriſt in his Throne, as he overcame, and fit with the Father in his Throne, Rev 3. 21. Eat therefore, O friends, drink and make you merry, O well beloved, much good do it you at this ſupper. You ſee therefore, that all the promiſes of the ſeven Churches, run into the laſt, which is ours, and to the ſupper of the Lamb. Therefore you ſee, that the moſt conquering and raigning Church that ever aroſe in Chriſtendome, is now ariſing in England; for you Whiterayment Chriſtians, ſhall ſit with Chriſt in his Throne, therefore you ſhall raigne: For Chriſt hath loved you, and waſhed you from your ſins, in his own blood, and made you Kings and Prieſts, to God his Father, and you ſhall raign on earth, (Rev. 5. 10.) for Chriſt will be clothed in a garment dipt in blood ſhortly, if he be not already, and you the hoſts of heaven, ſhall follow him on white horſes, for you are clothed in 
•
ine linen, white and pure, Rev. 19. 13, 14. There be many religions now in England, and maay m
•
ſe, which ſhall prevail; ſome ſay the Papiſts, ſome the Prelate, ſome the Anabaptiſts, ſome ſay the Browniſts, and every ſect now think to prevail; but I ſay the Whiterayment Chriſtians are the Iſrael of God, that have not defiled their garments, and they ſhall walk with Chriſt in white, for they are worthy, Rev. 3. 4. Peace

be upon that Iſrael of God, Gal. 6. 16. for they ſhall fit with Chriſt in his Throne, Rev. 3. 21. And therefore, becauſe you can ſing the ſong of Moſes, and of the Lamb, Rev. 15. 2. therefore I ſet Moſes bleſſing upon you, Deut. 33. Bleſſed are thou, O Iſrael, who is like unto thee? O people, ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and the ſword of thy glory; therefore thine enemies ſhall be in ſubjection unto thee, and thou ſhalt tread upon their high places. Chriſt is now ſhaking the heavens of the Churches, and the earth of the Heathen now; and ſhaking of the Churches, ſheweth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, that the things which are not ſhaken, may remain, Heb. 12. 26. But the Churches of the Lutherans and of England are now ſhaken, by a civill war, they are Churches divided againſt themſelves, Ergo, they muſt not ſtand, but come to nought, as Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 12. 25. and Rome ſhall be ſhaken too, and come to deſtruction, Ergo, they ſhall be removed from being Churches, that the things which are not ſhaken may remain, and that is the Church of the White-rayment Chriſtians, and citizens of the new Jeruſalem, which ſhall remain; for we receive the Kingdome which cannot be ſhaken, Heb. 12. 28. and are the pillars in the Temple of God, Rev. 3. 12. Therefore leave your wrangling for a Diſcipline, and heare Chriſts voyce, for behold, he knocketh, and will never leave rapping, untill you take his counſell in England, to buy gold, white-rayment and eye-ſalve: mark, he knocks to be let in for doctrine, for ſcarce one of a thouſand have bought theſe three: ſay with the White-rayment Chriſtians, Thou ſhalt guide me by thy counſell, and after receive me to a glorious Throne, Pſal. 73. 24. and city, for they ſhall enter into the gates of the city, and have right to the tree of life, R

v 22. 14. And now, deare friends, I have ſet before you in this Book, and in that of the blood of the Lamb, as it were, the two ſides of Jacobs ladder, whoſe foot was on earth, but the top reached to Heaven, and the Angels of heaven aſcended, and deſcended upon it, Gen. 28. 
••
. The two ſides of this ladder on earth, are Baptiſme, and the blood of the Lamb, though the foot of it be on earth, 1 John 5. in viſible ſignes, yet the top of it reacheth to heaven, for we are baptized into Chriſt in heaven, and by faith feed upon Chriſt, and are ſprinkled with Chriſts blood in heaven: The Angels of heaven will aſcend, and deſcend for your protection Heb. 1. You friends of the Bridegroom, and children of the marriagechamber, that are clothed in white-raiment; make much of this ladder, for though the foot of it be on earth, in water and blood, yet it reacheth unto heaven, unto Jeſus that came by water and blood, to ſend Angels down to you upon it: they that have no faith in their baptiſme into Chriſt, and in the blood of the Lamb, cannot tell, whether the Angels of God deſcend or aſcend for their protection, as Heathens, Jews, Turks, Devils, Witches, Papiſts, and all unbelievers. I have writ a little book of Good news for ſouldiers, or, the way to overcome the Devill, by the blood of the Lamb: I finde by Luke 21. 11. there isSee 2 Eſdras 13. 31. an earthquake, peſtilence and famine coming; for thus ſaith my Lord, and my God, When ye heare of wars, and ſeditions, that nation riſe againſt nation, andMa. kingdome againſt kingdome, there ſhall be great earthquakes, 
〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
, i. in, according to, or through thoſe places, and famine, and peſtilence, Luke 21. 11. Mark 13. 8. theſe are the beginnings of ſorrows. But in England, Scotland
Mi.

and Ireland, we heare of wars and ſeditions, that nation riſe againſt nation, and kingdome againſt kingdome. Ergo, there ſhall be great earth-quakes,Con.

〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
, i. in, according to, or through thoſe places, and famine and peſtilence, theſe are the beginnings of ſorrows; of which I have writ more fully in the Counſell of Chriſt to England. Now, as Moſes, when a peſtilence was comming, counſelled the Iſraelites a way to eſcape the deſtroying Angel, by ſprinking the blood of a Lamb, upon the two dore-poſts, and the upper dorepoſt of their houſes, that when God ſaw the blood, he ſaid, he would paſſe over them, and the plague ſhall not be upon you, to deſtruction; ſo 
•
 counſell you, the Iſrael of God, buy one of them books, for every houſe, and ſprinkle the faith of the blood of the Lamb upon your two dore-poſts of your bodies and ſoules, and the upper dore-poſt of your ſpirits, that when the deſtroying peſtilence ſhall come, God may ſee the blood of the Lamb upon your conſciences, he may cauſe it to paſſe over your houſes, where the Iſraelite of a good conſcience is within; and whatſoever comes to your bodies, yet your ſouls ſhall be ſafe: for as the Angels of heaven went up and down on Jacobs ladder, ſo they ſhall aſcend, and deſcend for your protection, that believe your bodies were waſhed with pure water in Baptiſme, and your hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, by the blood of the Lamb, you may keep your profeſſion without wavering, (of deliverance) Heb. 10. 22, 23. For he that dwelleth in this ſecret of the Lord, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty, Pſal. 91. 1. and he ſhall give his Angels a charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes, to beare thee in their arms, that thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone, v. 11. and peace ſhall be upon them, that walk according to this rule (of a new creature) and upon the Iſrael of God, Gal 6. 16.

Thine in the Lord Jeſus,
JOHN EACHARD.
