To my worthy Friend Mr James Ruſſel
Merchant.

SIR,


SOme years are elapſed, ſince I tooke notice, and became
ſenſible of that ſin which this Tract here declaimes againſt.
Being driven by men, but led by the marvellous
providence of God to this City, I obſerved my
feares did not deceive me; but as then I did divine, ſo it is come to
paſſe, that this ſin hath filled this City with rents and errours; whereby
the ſpirit of ſupplication and walking humbly with our God, the
ſpirit of love, minding the publike, and ſeeking one anothers good
hath left us, and inſtead hereof an evill ſpirit of cenſuring, ſcoffing,
inſulting on weakneſſes, wrangling, maintaining particular parties,
projecting how to promote ſelfe ends with neglect of the publike,
evill jealouſies and reports of one another, and which is to be feared,
inward rejoycing at one anothers harmes, hath overtaken even a
great number of thoſe, who a few yeares agoe ſeemed to be of another
temper. I have now out of a deepe ſenſe of the evils this ſin hath
brought upon us, reſolved to publiſh this Treatiſe, as a monitory to
men, to avoid this idolizing of men, as an evill ſavour that may
infect them, and to purge it out of their ſpirits as an evill humour
that may engender dangerous fevers in their ſoules, and is likely
to make this generation worſe and worſe; And as a forerunner to
ſuch Works as God ſhall enable me to publiſh, for clearing of the
truth to thoſe that in this time are deceived, by their dependence on
their admired Teachers: The memorable kindneſſes which you
have been pleaſed to exhibit to me in my low estate, and the cordiall
affection I perceive you beare to the proſperity of Chriſts Kingdome,
engage me to preſent this Sermon to you, as for your uſe, ſo for
ſome teſtimony of his gratitude, who deſires to approve himſelfe

Yours in the ſervice of Chriſt,
JOHN TOMBES.
