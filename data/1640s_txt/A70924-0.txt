TO
THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE
AND
moſt Illuſtrious Lord,
PHILIP Earle of Pembroke and
Mongomery, Baron Herbert of
Cardiffe and Shurland, &c. Lord
Chamberlaine of his Majeſties
Houſehold, Knight of
the Honourable Order of
the Garter; and one of his
Maieſties moſt Honourable
Privy
Counſell.

RIGHT HONOVRABLE,


IF Books were to be eſteemed
for their Bulke, and
not for their Worth:
I would not preſume to Dedicate

ſo little a Book as this is, to
ſo great a Lord as You are. But
ſince it is their Goodneſſe, and not
their Bigneſſe, that makes them recommendable:
the Book it ſelfe,
I hope, ſhall anſwer for me. For in
It, your Honour ſhall finde a great
deale of good matter, contained in
a little roome. In It, You ſhall
ſee the Doctrine of the Church of
Rome flatly condemned; and
the Doctrine of the Reformed
Church, fully Juſtified: And that,
not by any paſſages taken out of the
broken Ciſternes of the Traditions
of men; but by many expreſſe
Texts, and neceſſary Conſequences
drawn out of the Pure Fountain of
the very word of God. In a word,

though it be of a contemptible Stature:
yet you ſhall finde It to be a
pretty tall Man of his hands; skilfull
in his weapons; and ſo full of
mettle and ſpirit, that like a little
DAVID (comeing in the name
of the Lord, and being armed with
his Word) he foyles and utterly
overthrowes that Great GOLIAH
of Gath, I meane the Church of
Rome.

And now, moſt Illuſtrious Lord,
the thing that hath encouraged me
to make choice of Your Honour,
and ſeeke after Your Patronage,
is, that my Author (of Noble extraction
himſelfe) Dedicated this
Book of his to a Great and Religious
Princeſſe of my Nation,

Daughter to that Renowned
Prince, the late Duke of ROHAN:
by which example, I thought
my ſelfe obliged not to diſparage it
in England.

But the moſt prevalent Motive,
and, as I may ſay, the very Loadſtone
that hath attracted me thereunto,
is, chiefly, thoſe tranſcendent
vertues which I ſee ſhine ſo brightly
in Your Honor, and wherewith
God hath adorned Your Soule
as with a garment: I meane that
Fervent love You have to the
Truth: That Ardent Affection
You ſhew to the Sincerity of Religion:
and that Inbred and
Holy Hatred You beare, not onely
to all Popery and Superſtition:

but alſo to the leaſt thing
that might conduce thereunto.
And for the Confirmation of
this teſtimony of mine: Give me
leave, Moſt Noble Lord, to
boaſt that I am very ſtrong; and
may, with as much right as any
man, uſe in this the common Engliſh
Proverbe, that ſaith, I come
with a Witneſſe: ſince I bring
no leſſe with mee than the
Voyce of the whole Kingdome.

For indeed, Right Honorable,
though I have been in moſt
places of England, and have
carefully and diligently obſerved
the bent and affections of the People:
I never yet met with any man

that diſſented from that opinion.
What hopes then ſhould not I
have that Your Honor will accept
of this poore Labour of mine,
and afford It Your Protection,
ſince It ſutes ſo wel with Your diſpoſition;
and that You ſhall ſee
in It the Truth of that Religion
which You Profeſſe; and the Falſhood
of that Religion which
You Deteſt.

Vouchſafe therefore Moſt Illuſtrious
Lord, to receive It with a
gracious eye, and to afford It Your
Countenance. I know that for
Your Honors ſake, it will be
welcome to this Nation, when
they ſee Your Honorable Name
in the front of It. And I make

no queſtion but after they have
read It, they will love it alſo for
its owne ſake. If in theſe times
(wherein many looke back towards
Babylon again, and Popery hath
been here ſo bold as to thinke
her ſelfe at home) the Publicke receive
any fruit thereby, they ſhall
be obliged unto Your Honor for
it: but I more eſpecially, who
will acknowledge my ſelfe bound
ſo long as I live, to be and remaine,

Your Honours
moſt humble
and moſt devoted
Servant,
J. MOVNTAINE.
