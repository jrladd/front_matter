sse▪ and now being to depart from you; I thought good to bequeath this Sermon as a Legacie on you; and the rather because many doe earnestly desire it. I know it shall receive no worse intertainment, being presented to your view, then it had, when it founded lately in your eares. God multiply his blessings on you, and preserve the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace amonst you, and continue you in your zeale to his service, in your love to hi

•
ith you, and still ready to serve you, and


Your
