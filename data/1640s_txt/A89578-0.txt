TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.

YOur time is ſo taken up with the important Worke of reſcuing theſe bleeding Kingdomes, and the Church of Chriſt in and with them, that I am ſure you are not at leiſure to read long Epiſtles; and were I able in a Dedication to write what might very much kindle your zeale, provoke your whole inward man, and thereby further your great Work; I conceive it were onely to tell the world what counſell I thought might doe you good; and therefore in ſtead of ſtudying to preſent you with an Epiſtle, which few of you would read, I doe onely obey your Order, and at your Command publiſh to the view, and for the uſe of all, and preſent unto your ſelves this plaine Sermon, Preached unto you upon the day of your late Thankſgiving unto God for one of the greateſt mercies (the Victory, and what came with it duly conſidered) that God hath beſtowed upon our unworthy Nation theſe many yeares. What elſe I deſire to have preſſed upon your hearts, I chuſe to doe it when I am called at any time to Preach unto you, or rather to beg it for you at the Throne of Grace; where you, and your great Work are every day (as by many thouſand others) humbly remembred by

Your moſt obliged Servant
STEPHEN MARSHALL.
