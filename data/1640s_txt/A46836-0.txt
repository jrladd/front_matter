TO HIS CHRISTIAN FRIENDS, Beloved in the LORD, in London, Cambridge, Yorkshire, Suffolk, Essex, and elswhere; The Exceeding Riches of Grace be advanced.


My Beloved;

MY Spirit rejoyceth in the Lord, who hath put such an opportunitie as this into my hand, of Publishing to you, and to others, (and hereby of Advancing,) The Exceeding Riches of the Grace of God, in such a Pattern thereof, as here followeth: The Daughter of a gracious Matrone, of mine acquaintance in the Parish where I weekly Preach in London: who was in as hopeles and desperate a condition in her selfe, as ever was any. Now often admiring, and uttering to others, especially to afflicted, despairing, mournfull soules, (that resort now to her,) the unsearchable Treasures of Grace, to the ungodly, and chiefest of lost, undone sinners. The main Causes urging me to Publish it to you, and the Contents thereof, are in the Books beginning: The severall Vses are in the End. You know that the works of Iehovah are great, honorable, wonderfull, and glorious; and are greatly to be magnified; sought out of all them that have pleasure therein: He makes them to be remembered. (Ps. 111.

upon) all his works. How desireable is it to one, and to the friends of one, that is in great extremity of misery, bodily, or spirituall; to hear of another, that was just in the same condition, that now is cured? How much longed for, is a safe Harbour, to a weather-beaten Ship, tossed with Tempests? (Isa. 54. 11.) How refreshful is rest and ease, to a tempted, hurried, wearied soule? (Iob 7.2-4.) How joyfull and beautifull is the

chiefe of sinners,
Eph. 2.15.16.3. enemies, murmurers, ungodly ones? to souls wearied out in looking on themselves, and their sins, and desperate wickednesse of their own hearts; and that gladly would mend all, and patch up a righteousnesse in themselves, or partly there: (Rom. 10.3.) that would first finde a thorough change in them, such a dying of sin, and holy walking; before they think they may beleeve that Christ dyed for such as they
Rom. 5. 7, 8. 10.; or justifies such ungodly
Rom. 4.5. ones; How mighty (through2 Cor. 10. 4 God) may it be, to support poor soules, that are perswaded they are reprobates
Lam. 3.8-17-22.40., that are assured of it upon certain grounds, (as they judge;) and that they are damn'd
Io. 3.17.22., and in Hell already; that never any in their case was, or can be saved1 Cor. 6.9-11.;

that the sins of Manasses, of David, of Peter, of Paul, of Mary Magdalen, yea, and of Cain, Iudas, and Pilate, are all lesse then their sins, & blasphemies; and if all they might be saved, yet themselves should surely be damn'd: for such to hear of one, that but lately was in the very same condition; now sounding forth, and wondring at, the Exceeding Riches of Grace to her, the chiefest of sinners, (Psal. 35.10.) to hear her selfe telling such despairing soules; You cannot be more desperate, or more certain of hell and wrath, then I lately was: and comforting them, by the same consolations, wherewith her own soul is now comforted in the Lord. (2 Cor. 1.4.) This, all this, you have here held forth, in this Pattern of Gods patience, and abundant goodness towards this his unworthy Handmaid, whose low & base estate he hath regarded: He causing LIGHT to shine out of DARKNES, (2 Cor. 4.6.) The writing, transcribing, and often perusing hereof, hath been, and is sweet and precious to me, I must confesse: I with your reading it may be so, and much more, to your soules.

As you reade, Consider; Admire the LORD in his surpassing Grace to ungodly ones. (Mic. 7.18.) Do not so commend the party, that is but an Earthen vessel, born in sin,

Psal. 51.5. as you

Eph. 2.1-3: are: but still, all along exalt and commend the LORD, who alone is to be exalted, (Isa. 2.11. 1 Cor. 1.29, 30, 31.) Who puts his treasure into an Earthen vessel of purpose, that the excellency of the power may be of God,

and not of flesh. (2 Cor. 4. 7.) Be the more vile in your own eyes, when you see, God is pacified towards you, for all that you have done, (Ezek. 16. 63.) And from beleeving his love to your soules; in love study what you should render to him, in Christs Name, (Psal. 116.12. Col. 3.17.) Praise the Lord for leaving such Patterns of his Riches of Grace, [as that of Mris
Drake Revived, and that of Gods gracious thoughts, towards great sinners, (by Dr
Homes;) in a late Book, so called; so] especially this: And Pray for her, [if the Lord shall restore her body, which as yet is weak, to eat at all, or to drink but very little, (of faire water, or small Beere, and that onely at once in two, or three, or foure dayes:) and by her daily spending that small strength shee hath, by often uttering forth the treasures of Grace, and by oft speaking to comfort despairing soules: seven or moe whereof have resorted to her:] that shee may walke humbly, rendring againe in her measure, according to the benefit done unto her. [Since the former was fitted for the Presse, shee then not being likely to live, unlesse the Lord should work a Miracle: He raised her wonderfully, by faith in his Sonne, without any meanes, (when shee could use none;) and that by two degrees: First, to EATE, and to ARISE, (Iun. 11. 1647.) Then (on Midsummer day,) to WALK; as both follow, neer the end of the Book, Pag. 133. to 143.] And Pray for despairing soules, (here now being many of them)

and for the more exalting of Jesus Christ, in the powring out of his Spirit upon his sonnes and daughters that beleeve, by stretching out his hand to heale, (soules and bodies:) and that Signes and wonders may be done in his Name; As the Disciples prayed, Act. 4. 29. as he hath promised, Iob. 7. 38, 39. Mark. 16. 17. Act. 2. 38. That the Earth (which now is so full of smoake and
