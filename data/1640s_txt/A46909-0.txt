To the Right Worſhipfull, and his much honoured friend John Savile of Methley Eſquire, and High-Sheriffe of the Countie of York.


SIR,

ONe being friendly chidden, that he did not write Books, made this anſwer, ut libet non licet, ut licet non libet; As he would he could not, and as he could he would not. I confeſſe I have been often expoſtulated withall by ſome particular friends & relations, (who uſually over rate whom they love,) 
〈…〉
hy in this ſcribbling age, wherein the Pen is ſo Rheumatick, I have never appeared in Print 
•
 but my anſwer is made before;

I atteſt the ſearcher of hearts, never thought any light that ſhone from my darkneſſe, worthy to bee ſet on ſo publique a Stage, eſpecially in this cenſorious age, which like Auguſt
•
 Caeſar, Taxeth all the World wherein (by reaſon of the contrarietie of mens judgements and affections) Sermons are made b
••
 the Whetſtones for men to ſharpen their tongues upon.
The cauſes which move me a
•
 this time to be more publique beſides the importunitie 
〈◊〉
 friends, (the ordinary Midwif
•
 of the Preſſe) are theſe, firſt that I might once in my life beſtow a ſmall Token on the Spou
〈…〉
 of Chriſt; and ſecondly, that might in a ſlender gift, give a teſtimony of a not ſlender affection towards you, not having

wherewithall further to honour you. The State hath put the white Rod in your right hand, let me take the boldneſſe to put a Role in your left.
It was the cuſtome of the ſubjects of Artaxerxes King of the Perſians, to preſent him ſomething in his travell; a poor labouring man having nothing elſe, brought him a little water from the River that ran by, and preſented it with both his hands; which the King did with a cheerfull countenance accept, eſteeming it as honourable to receive ſmall things, from a large heart, as to impart great. If my abililitie were as large as my heart, I would do more to honour you; bee pleaſed therefore to accept what I can, ſince I cannot doe what I would.

Theſe poor thoughts of mine muſt needs redound upon your ſelfe, for every thing muſt acknowledge its firſt Spring and riſe; they were yours in ſervice to your deſire, be pleaſed to let them be yours in acceptance and Patronage. The God of truth and peace give you to be famous in Ephrata, and do worthily in Bethlehem, that you may lay out all your power and affections in a flaming zeal of the glory of Gods truth and the Kingdoms peace, which is the conſtant prayer of him, who is,

Your Worſhips affectionate ſervant,
John Johnſon.
