TO THE
Honourable
HOUSE of COMMONS.
Now ASSEMBLED in
PARLIAMENT.

IT is fit my obedience
should last as long as your
commands, for so I
have alwayes interpreted your
Requests and desires to be. As I
never had the confidence to present
you with any thing properly
mine, so neither will I bee
guilty of that Injustice, as to
deny you any thing so truly your
own, as is this fruit of my poore
yet willing endeavours. It is
yours truly, but most principally

the Churches, whose both
you, and I, and all that you can
doe, or I speak, are. If it may
be serviceable to you, and you
by it made more serviceable to
the Church and cause of God,
I have my option. But I am
resolved not to make that use of
my experience of your patience
in hearing the Sermon, as to
try it further with the length of
a Dedication: Only I thinke it
my dutie to second my proposition
with my prayers, That God
would vouchsafe a blessing to
your endeavours for his Church,
and to you for your endeavours.
These shall be the constant
and earnest desires of

Your Servant
Stephen Marshall.
