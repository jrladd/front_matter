To the truely Noble,
and much honored,
Sr. ROBERT ANSTRUTHER
Knight, and one of the
Gentleman of his Majeſties
Privy Chamber.


SIR,


IT is a poſition, and
maine Tenent agreed
upon by the moſt judicious,
that to attaine unto Honour,
Wiſedome is the truly Poleſtarre,
and to retaine it, Vertue
the ſole Patroneſſe: It being non

ad tempus Invitamentum, ſed perpetuae
virtutis premium. To
which, though ſome have arrived
by favour, others by fortune,
yet it may be ingeniouſly confeſt
of You, that by Your owne
merit You have won to this meridian:
Into which the ſacred
Majeſty of Great Brittaine having
a true inſpection, out of
many others, hee made ſelect
choiſe of you, (for your known
abilities) to create his Lord Embaſſadour
to the Majeſty of the
Empire. And during your abode
at Vienna in Auſtria, where
the Emperors Court was then
kept, the Gentleman, Author

hereof, Mr. Richard Hurſt (now
deceaſed) your (then) ſervant
and Secretary, at his more ſpare
and retired houres, made this
his Worke his play, and in his
moſt ſolitude his beſt ſolace.
And unto whoſe Patronage may
it more properly appertaine,
than to your Noble ſelfe, being
writ in your forraigne ſervice.
This was the maine inducement,
which not onely incouraged,
but imboldned me to
this preſentment, knowing that
Honos alit Artes; and the rather
preſuming on your acceptance
hereof, ſince they who in their
life time the Muſes moſt favour,

thoſe, after life, the nine
Siſters moſt honour. Thus,
with pardon for my boldneſſe
crav'd, I humbly take
my leave of You.

Yours in all
Obſervance,
S. B.
