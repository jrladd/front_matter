TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL Richard Braithwaite ESQVIRE.


Sir,



I
 Have (though boldly being a stranger) elected you, to countenance a piece, that (undeservedly I hope) hath beene denied the credit which it might have gain'd from the Stage; though I can

accuse my selfe of no errour in it, more than a nice curiosity (which not withstanding I must boast to be without president) in the method where I have deni'd my selfe much liberty, that may be allow'd a Poet from old example, and new establisht custome. Your selfe have given many sufficient testimonies of your owne abilities and judgement, by your owne many published and unquestionable labours. In giving way and pardon to this bold act of mine, you will engage to thankefulnesse, & honour him that is ambitious to be knowne by you, and stil'd

Your honourer and humble Servant,
Thomas Nabbes.
