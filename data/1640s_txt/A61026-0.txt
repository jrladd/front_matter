TO My Honorable Friends Sir John Wray Knight and Baronet, Sir William Strickland Knight and Baronet; Both Members of the Honorable Houſe of Commons.

HONORABLE;



I
Know ye both well to have loved the acquaintance of Truth long, and in thoſe times when truth was an errour,

and light darkneſſe in the account of most; therefore I hope the ſame Lord will not ceaſe to reveal to ye more of himſelf, till ye come to know as ye ſhall be known. The truths (if I miſtake them not) I here preſent you, are of Free-grace, ſuch things as if cleared to the World, would enlighten us more in the myſtery of iniquity then any other. There is one thing appears to us in the diſcovery of this, which is love, God loving us freely, and ſending out his Spirit of love into our hearts; this ſhould be that onely principle of power in beleevers now under the Goſpel: love began all the

work of ſalvation in God, and love ſhould carry on this work of ſalvation in men· This is a way of ſervice which none know, but thoſe whom the Son hath made free indeed.

The Lord fill ye with this love, that ye may obey as gloriouſly as ye are commanded in the Goſpel, and that the experiences of Free-grace may dwell richly in ye; that ye may ſpiritually judge of the ſiner and more ſubtile parts of Antichriſt. All is not in that groſſe Idolatry, which is ſeen and felt; there is more of myſtery then ſo in it.
I could not but thus publikely

acknowledge ye, who are ſuch publike Aſſertors of that Liberty we of this Kingdom enjoy at this day, and becauſe ye have acknowledged me in many favours to my ſelf formerly; for which I am

Your Servant in the Lord, JOH. SALTMARSH.
