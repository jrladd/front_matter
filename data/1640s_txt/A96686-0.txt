TO THE
RIGHT HONOVRABLE
ROBERT
Earl of Warwick, Governour in Chiefe,
and Lord High Admirall of all thoſe Iſlands and
other Plantations of the Engliſh in AMERICA;
Together with the reſt of thoſe truly Honorable
Members of both Houſes of Parliament joyned in
Commiſſion with him for ordering the
affaires of the ſaid Plantations.


Right Honourable,


WEre not your Wiſdome and experience in the
great and weighty affaires of State ſo well
known, and were yee not ſo much accuſtomed
to the unjuſt complaints of clamorous perſons▪
I might be diſcouraged to appeare in the righteous
cauſe of the United Colonies of New-England,
and more eſpecially in the behalf of the Governour
and Company of the Maſſachuſets, to render a reaſon of
their juſt and righteous proceedings againſt Samuel Gorton
and his Companions, who however (where they are unknown)
they goe here under the garbe of a peaceable people; yet if your
Honours, and the reſt 
•
f the Honourable Committee ſhall be
pleaſed (when more weighty employments ſhall give way) to peruſe
our juſt defence againſt his clamorous complaints, and
ſcandalous Treatiſe, called, Simplicities defence againſt

Seven-headed Policy, &c. I make no queſtion but yee will receive
full ſatisfaction in what we have done, and be ready to
juſtifie our proceedings againſt them as godly and righteous.
The reaſon wherefore I am forced to appeare in Print before
I give a particular anſwer to your Honou
•
s, and the reſt of the
Honourable Committee, is, becauſe I find a more groſſe deformatory
aſperſion caſt upon the Countrey to the publick view of our
Nation: which as it is deare in our eyes (witneſſe our frequent
publick ſolemn dayes of prayer to the Throne of grace for it, together
with our private ſupplications, which the Searcher of the
heart beſt knows, ſympathizing with it in every condition, to
the loſſe of Ships, Goods, &c. to the great weakening of our
eſtates) ſo wee deſire to remove whatſoever may ſadden the
thoughts of our Nation againſt us; eſpecially your Honours, and
all that are godly in Chriſt Jeſus.
What greater wrong can bee done a poore perſecuted people
that went into the wilderneſſe to avoid the tyrannicall Government
of the late Hierarchy, and to enjoy the Liberties Chriſt
Jeſus hath left unto his Churches (which theſe blaſphemous
Adverſaries of ours, ſo much ſleight and caſt off) then to be accounted
perſecutors of Chriſt in his Saints, yea, to go thither
to that end, to become outragiouſly cruell, barbarouſly inhumane,
uniting together to ſuck the blood of our Country-men,
&c. And yet Right Honorable, it will and doth appear
in the following Treatiſe, that Samuel Gorton was proſecuted
againſt, Firſt, at Plymouth as a groſſe diſturber of
the Civill peace and quiet of that Government, in an open
factious and ſeditious manner. Secondly, hee was no leſſe
troubleſome, but much more at Roade Iſland, having gotten
a ſtrong party to adhere unto him, affronting that Government
(as Plymouth) in their publique adminiſtration of
Juſtice ſo foully and groſſely, as mine eares never heard
the like of any; to which Relation in the following Diſcourſe I

referre your Honours, being compiled as briefly as may bee▪
Gorton being there whipt in his perſon, and thence baniſhed
with ſome of his principall adherents, they went next to
Providence, where Mr. Williams, and ſome others have
built a ſmall Towne. This people receiving them with all
humanity in a cold ſeaſon, when the former places could no
longer beare his inſolencies; hee ſoone undermined their Government,
gained a ſtrong party amongſt them to his owne,
to the great diſtraction of Mr. Williams, and the better
party there, contending againſt their Laws, and the execution
of Juſtice, to the effuſion of bloud, which made Mr. Williams
and the reſt ſadly complaine to the Government of the
Maſſachuſets, and divers of them take the protection of that
Government, to defend their perſons and eſtates. But when
they ſaw Mr. Williams reſolve rather to loſe the benefit of
his labours, then to live with ſuch ill-affected people, and
the neighbour Governments become affected with Gortons
miſ-rule there alſo, hee (and his Companions in evill)
began then to thinke of buying a place of a great aſp
•
ring
Sachim, or Indian Prince, to the wrong of the proper Owners,
(two infer
••
ur Sachims) who alſo, as well as divers
Engliſh of Providence, ſubmitted their perſons and lands
to the Government of the Maſſachuſets, and deſired their
protection not onely againſt the oppreſsing tyranny of Myantonimo
the foreſaid Great Sachim, but againſt Gorton and
his Companions, who intr
•
ded into their proper right, by
unwarrantable meanes, &c. Now the Government of the
Maſsachuſets having uſed all due meanes and none prevailing,
but their gentleneſſe anſwered with the greateſt
contempt that might bee: At the next Meeting of the
Commiſsioners for the United Colonies they complained of Gorton
and his irregular Companions, which the ſaid Commiſſioners
tooke into ſerious conſideration, and the more becauſe

of Gortons, &c. extraordinary familiarity with Myantonimo,
and the reſt of the Nanohigganſet Sachims, who
were knowne to bee in a deepe Conſpiracy againſt all the Engliſh
in the Land at the ſame time. And therefore by a
ſolemne Act gave liberty to the Government of the Maſſachuſets
to call them to account, and proceed with them ſo
farre as might ſtand with righteouſneſſe and juſtice, which
they accordingly did.
Now theſe Right Honourable, &c. are the true cauſes of all
the Cenſures and puniſhments that befell Gorton in the
Countrey; onely needleſly in his and their contemptuous anſwers
to the modest and well-ordered Writings of the ſaid Government
of the Maſſachuſets, they b
•
lched forth ſuch horrid
blaſphemies, not onely againſt them in particular, and
Civill Government in the generall, but againſt the received
Chriſtian Religion of all the Reformed Churches in Europe,
as well as our ſelves; Inſomuch as many tender Conſciences,
both Miniſters and others, thought the Government
did not well in giving him ſuch liberty, whereby hee
may and doth (as is reported) poyſon other perſons and
places with his corrupt opinions, to the great diſhonour of
God, and ruine of the ſoules of his followers, who reject the
meanes of grace Go
•
 hath ſanctified to ſtrengh
•
hen and build up
his people in faith and holineſſe.
But that I may not bee tedious, I ſhall preſume to preferre
theſe following requeſts to your Honours and the reſt
of the honoured Committee this Renowned Parliament hath
betruſted with the affaires of the Forraigne Plantatio
•
s of
our Nation: The firſt is to ſtrengthen the Ceaſure of the
Maſſachuſets by your favourable approbation, ſo farre as it
ſhall appeare to bee juſt and righteous▪ and then ſhall the
Cou
•
trey bee the more preſerved from their feares of the
Go
•
tonians deſperate cloſe with ſo dangerous enemies as their

malignant neighbours the Nanohigganſets; which I perſwade
my ſelfe, if you leiſures will ſuffer you to read the following
Diſcourſe, you will eaſily condeſcend unto▪ there being nothing
(I thanke God in it) affirmed by mee, but as it is affirmed
hereunto I may ſafely depoſe. A ſecond thing is, that yee will
never ſuffer Samuel Gorton this peſtilent diſturber of our
Societies, any more to goe to New-England to diſquiet
the peace thereof. My third requeſt is, that yee will
be pleaſed to ſuffer New-Plymouth, to enjoy their former
liberty in the line of their Government, which includeth their
very ſeat, even Shawamet it ſelfe, where Gorton and his
Company dwelt. My fourth requeſt is, to take into your ſerious
conſideration, how deſtructive it will prove to the well-being
of our Plantations and proceedings there, (who by Gods bleſſing
are growing up into a Nation) here to anſwer to the complaints
of ſuch malignant ſpirits as ſhall there bee cenſured by
Authority, It being three thouſand miles diſtant, ſo far as will
undoe any to come for Juſtice, utterly diſabling them to prove
the equity of their cauſe, unleſſe their eſtate bee very great.
My fifth and laſt requeſt is, that your Honours, and the reſt
of the Honoured Committee will be pleaſed to patronize the
weake labours of your humble ſervant, in the juſt defence hee
hath made for New-England, and the ſeverall Governments
of it (eſpecially the Maſſachuſets) againſt the groſſe
calumnies of the fore-mentioned ſcandalous Treatiſe publiſhed
by the ſaid Gorton: And herein yee ſhall not onely oblige
our Plantations of New-England to continue their daily requeſt
to the God of all mercies for a bleſsing upon this Renowned
Parliament, and your Honours, and the reſt of this Honoured
Committee in eſpeciall, but to engage with, and for them and
you, againſt all oppoſers of the State, to the laſt drop of bloud
in our veines; yea, hereby ſhall you ſweeten the tedious travels,
great charges and labours of me their unworthy Agent, who doe

and ſhall daily pray to God to recompenſe your vaſt hazzards,
expenſes, ſtudies, and cares, (to advance the Weale Publike
of this diſtreſſed Kingdome, and the ſeverall limbs thereof)
with all the bleſsings of Heaven and earth to you and yours
to ſucceeding Generations.

Yours Honours humble devoted ſervant,
EDVV. WINSLOVV.
