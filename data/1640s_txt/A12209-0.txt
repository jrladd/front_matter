TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL Sir John Howland, Knight.

SIR,


THese two Sermons were brought unto me for the Sermons of that learned and religious Divine, whose name they beare: and, so farre as I am able to judge, the stile and spiritualtie of the matter

argue no lesse. Being earnestly requested to peruse them, I thought fit to commend them to the world under your name, because I know that you so well affected the Author. Now my request unto you is, that you would be pleased to accept the Dedication of them as a testimony of his sincere affection, who labours, and prayes for your good in the best things,

Your Worships to be commanded in all Christian service;
R. T.
