To his EXCELLENCE the Earle of ESSEX, Lord Generall of the Army raiſed for defence of the KING, Parliament, and Kingdome.

SIR,

UNtill my Troupe was diſabled, I ſerved faithfully with my SWORD, under your Command (an eye-witneſſe of your noble Patience, Conſtancy and Valour) and ſhall againe when my Troupe is recruted: In the meane time, being ingaged thereto (by that emblematicall device which I beare in my Cornet) I have endeavoured to be ſerviceable with my PEN, that I might imploy every faculty which God hath given me for the King and Parliament, to whom I am obliged by a double duty: and (I hope) not impertinently to the glory of the Almighty; who, when moſt honourable teachers are not regarded, ſends men to learn of Piſmires and deſpicable creatures; and, who for that cauſe, is now pleaſed to make uſe of ſuch a Vanity as I am: and (it may be) ſhall by this Engine, more ſtrengthen your Army, then a full Regiment of horſe.
I have not here prefixed your Name, or tendred this to your peruſall, meerly for a private advantage: for, what can I hope to obtain, who am but Terrae filius, a child of contempt? and, whoſe beſt endeavours have beene hitherto, in outward reſpects, (for upon other

conſiderations, I have no reaſon to complaine) rather miſchievous, then profitable unto him.
Neither preſume I to add any thing hereby to your Honour (that being farre above the dificiency needing ſuch meane Additions) but, I being yet within the liſt of your Army, it ſeems reaſonable, that ſome Account ſhould be given of the time ſpent during my abſence from it: and I, having no better fruit ripe, thus, to preſent this, held it the duty, SIR, of

Your EXCELLENCIES moſt humble Servant,
Geo. Wither.
