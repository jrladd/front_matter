TO The Right Honourable My very good LORD, WILLIAM EARLE of SALISBƲRIE, One of the LORDS of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privie Councell, and Knight of the moſt Noble order of the GARTER.

NEither (Right Honourable) are theſe borne out of time; for (as Solomonſaies,) The memory of the just is bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot: and here is this Scripture verified in your

eyes. Here are good men celebrated, their vertnes powred out to participation; or, if this indeed has been no firſt, let it have acceptance yet as the latter raine: for ſo to pious remonſtrances, there appertaines inculcation; and the Penpateuch of Moſes, has, after an Exodus, a Deuteronomium, a Lex repetita. Theſe, I ſay, iſſue not unſeaſonably; for thus have I found a way to correct and redeem ſome ſcattered imperfect Copies, and cleare my debt towards him, with whom I was long converſant, at the ſame hearth, the ſame boord, and in the ſame bedde. Thus a meanes of acknowledging my dependency, with your Lordſhips manifold extraordinary favours: and

thus by reprehending ſome others, have I (for the time to come) layd a forcible tie upon my owne behaviour. After which account given for the publiſhing, and Dedication, I reſt,

Your Lordſhips moſt humble Servant,
George Tooke.
