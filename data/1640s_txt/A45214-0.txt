TO THE KINGS MOST SACRED MAIESTIE.

Moſt dread Soveraigne,


YOur Majeſty was pleaſed to caſt a gracious eye upon a late Humble Remonſtrance, made to the High Court of Parliament, bemoaning the laweleſse frequence of ſcandalous Libels, and modeſtly aſſerting the true right of Liturgie and Epiſcopacie. I little thought that ſo meek and gall-leſſe a Diſcourſe could have irritated any the leaſt oppoſition; But now, I find to my griefe, that even to move for Peace, is

quarrell enough; and feele many fiſts about my eares, ere I could imagine to have offended. Occaſion is taken from thoſe quiet lines, to combine forces againſt the Cauſe I maintained. The quarrell is inſolently managed by many unknowne hands; Yet, the riot of theſe impotent Aſſailants ſhould not eaſily have drawn me forth, had I not perceived that their confident oſtentation and proud carriage in this affray, hath won them ſome (how undeſerved ſoever) opinion of skill, with their credulous Abettors; and thereby, ſome diſadvantage to my juſt cauſe. As one therefore that hates to betray the truth by an unfaithfull ſilence, I doe cheerfully enter theſe liſts; rejoycing to hope that Your Majeſties Eye may be the Judge and VVitneſſe of my ſucceſſe. Neither ſhall it be diſpleaſing to Your

Majeſtie, that Your moſt honourable Peeres, and moſt faithfull Commons, now aſſembled, ſhall ſee the injustice, and ungroundedneſſe of that bold Appeale, which was made to them, by my daring Anſwerers; whoſe Abilities I taxe not, but their Fidelity I must; as thoſe who have ſought foulely to abuſe their implored Judges with falſe ſhews of miſ-alledged Antiquity, and meerly colourable pretences of proofs: VVhich if I doe not make good to them and the world in this enſuing Diſcourſe, let the blemiſh of reputation lead way to the ſharpeſt cenſure upon the perſon of


Your Majeſties zealouſly-loyall Subject, The moſt humble Remonſtrant.
