TO THE GENERALTY OF His Noble friends, Gentlemen of the severall Honorable Houses the Inns of Courtâ–ª



GENTLEMEN,


I Have presum'd thus upon you, to countenance my shame fact Bride; who now she is prest blusheth to appeare in publick, through feare shee hath of a new danger from publicke censure. She is here drest according to mine own desire and intention; without

ought taken from her that my selfe thought ornament; nor supplyed with any thing which I valued but as rags. Your favorable opinion, and your acceptance of her into your protection, will take off her feares, and make her present her selfe fronte laeto: and the honor that you doe me thereby will adde: to those many engagements that binde me alwayes to declare my selfe

Your most thankfull servant. THOMAS NABBES.
