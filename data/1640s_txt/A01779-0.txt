To the Right Honourable his singular good Lord THOMAS LORD WENTWORTH.

My LORD!


SO many are the noble attributes inherent to your Heroicke Nature, that 'tis difficult to distinguish whither they be divers, or one intire virtue, but impossible to define which ought to be accounted the Superlative in so perfect a Harmony: to ascribe to one more then to another, were to derogate

from the justice of either. I cannot therefore proclaime 'twas any particular, but your generall Goodnesse which has imboldn'd me to intrude this Poem on the Patronage of your Name, as honourable in vertue as in Greatnesse: nor shall I tender any excuse for the presumption, since I am assured your Lordship cannot conceive an anger from the true devotion of


Your humblest honourer, Hen: Glapthorne.
