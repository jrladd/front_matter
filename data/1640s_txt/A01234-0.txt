To the right Worſhipfull, Sir Nicholas Rainton, Knight, Preſident, the Worſhipfull Martin Bond, Eſquire, Treaſurer, with the Governours of the Hoſpitall of little S Bartholomewes, W. F. wiſheth that Grace and Peace may be multiplied.

WHat I ſtudied for your private Chappell, and there delivered before ſome of you, on Tueſday the 19. of Iune, laſt paſt, I have been importuned to make publick, as for a common good. If it be good, then quò communius, eò melius, the more publicke it becommeth, the more good it may doe. I wiſht well in the ſtudy and delivery of it to as many as deſire the proſperity of our royall foundation. In the publiſhing of it, I would gladly have it conceived that my zeale is the ſame for the publicke welfare▪ If that memorable act of your piety▪

which occaſioned this Sermon, ſhall provoke ſome well minded ones to imitate your example elſewhere, or incite the able handed to promote ſuch charitable undertakings for the comfort of ſo many ſick and diſtreſſed ſoules daily by your care refreſhed: it may redound much to Gods glory, your owne comforts, and the happineſſe of thoſe whom God ſhall move hereby to tread in your ſteps. If no ſuch thing ſucceed, yet it ſhall be your honour to have lighted up the candle of ſo good an example for the times to come: as it is, and ſhall be, for you all, that God may long continue to our Hoſpitall, your pious care for the happy and orderly government thereof, the daily prayer of

Your Hoſpitaler, William Freake.
From my Study in your Hoſpitall the 12 day of Feb. 1639.
