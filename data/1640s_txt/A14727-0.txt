To the most Excellent Majesty of the Royall CHARLES, &c.
O KING live for ever, and be graciously pleased to take in good part this little Stone, and this little Booke, which is an Interpreter of the Vertues thereof. A Stone if your Majesty regards the price, to bee lesse esteemed then the meanest Gem. But if you respect its use and profit in the Arte of Navigation and Dyalling, yea and in Divinity it selfe; it is not to be counted deare, though in comparison of the most precious Diamond.

If the quantity of it be considered, it scarce exceeds a little clodd of Earth: But if we consider the respects it hath to the Arctick and Antartick poles to the Tropick circles and the Aequinoctiall, then it equalls the Terrestriall▪ Globe, hereupon it was deservedly called by the name Terrell
•

 as Gilbert the founder of this Magnetick discipline hath termed it; If wee looke upon its outward shew and beauty, there is no smoothnes, no brightnesse in it, as in Pearles, it hath no splendour, no transparency, as other precious stones: therefore by Claudian it is cal'd Decolor ill coloured. And by Berchori
••
 ferrugineus of the color of rusty Iron, but if the inward force and vertue of it be considered, it doth exceedingly surpasse the most precious stones, for which cause by ancient Grecians

was called

vera diceret. O happy me if that he speake the truth. By your Majesties good leave, I dare promise this with good assurance that if your Majesty alone were the possessor of it, it would easily make you the Monarch of the whole world, for to them that passe the

Seas, this stone is another Neptune, and most faithfull conductor to the havens, and to them that travell by land another Mercurie, a most certaine guide in all journyes, especially because it is the most powerfull ruler of the Iron generation, which easily subjects all other mettals, and in that respect also, it is the most excellent patterne and lively Embleme of your most admirable Monarchicall and mild Government, for this was alwayes my constant and undoub

••
d opinion, this I alwaies thought with the greatest Politicians and Divines, and openly professed it before all men, that an hereditary Monarchy, (such as this is, under which it was my happy lot to draw my vitall breath, to enjoy all sorts of blessings, and to live in all godly conversation and tranquillity,

is by many degrees the most profitable, and most praise-worthy of all formes of Government, which are any where used, or that can be imagined; unto this Monarchicall Estate I have alwayes wished well, as he knoweth who searcheth my heart and reynes. Furthermore it is approved by the consent of all Writers, and by the Mottoes of many Emperours, that a Magnetick manner of Governing is most safe, most acceptable, and most commodious, both for Princes and Subjects, for as suger, (according to the testimony of Fernelius) doth the very same things, and all in a better and sweeter manner then honey doth, so a Magnetick affection doth effect more then flavish terrour, and a filiall love of subjects, is better then servile feare. Behold how the Loadstone

subdues to it selfe all kind of Iron, which otherwise is scarce wrought upon, by files, hammers, and fiers, it is done, not by force of Armes, but by helpe of love. So the Iron is held in a du

o one body, under the Loadstone, as it were their King, how it stands stil with a kind of quaking affrightment, and doth cover it in the forme of a shield, it doth compasse about the Loadstone, after the manner of a Guard, it doth yeeld sustenance and service unto it, as the Bees doe to their King or Master Bee, which is without a sting; a cleare and illustrious Hierogliphicke,
