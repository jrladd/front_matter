TO THE RIGHT WORTHY AND EVER HIGH ESTEEMED, Mr. RICHARD COMPTON, Eſquire, perpetuall health and proſperity.

THe many obligations (honored Sir) which your deſerving actions have made me ſervant to draw mee to another engagement, which is no leſſe noble, then thoſe boundleſſe bounties, which you ſo oft have conferred upon me: Therefore I now become an humble petitioner, th
•
t your good liking will protect mee from the detraction of all Mom
•
ſts and Zoylans; and in ſo doing, I ſhall not feare that any one will ſay this my off-ſpring is

illegitimate, becauſe your favourable eye not onely nullifies the malice of all adverſe wills, but addes baptiſme to this innocent, which here lies mute, wrapped up in the purity of white ſheets: nay more, your gentle worded cenſure confirmes the ſame, and inliſts it in the roule of Fame and Reputation. Admire then this ſmall penſion of my braine with mild benevolence, ſo may you adde courage to a young beginner, and make his Labour immortall by your ſmiling favour; for except this modell find mercy in your kinde acceptance, the creation, which I beſtowed upon it, was onely to make it nauſeall to all mens ſtomacks, and me ridiculous, becauſe I ever obſerved your word to be of more value, then ever my merits could reach unto; then what is it that Your countenance will not perſwade, if You pleaſe to adde but a few ſillables to make your will appeare? Si dicas, factum eſt. If I thought or knew not your power to be prevalent in this which I requeſt, I would not have ſo audaciouſly adventured to ſollicite any ſuch curteſie;

but I am confirmed of this knowledge, and confident of your ever too little praiſed good nature, which is a perfect ſpark of that heavenly goodneſſe which giveth all things, becauſe Your chiefe deſire is to helpe Your friend with all ſort of encouragement poſſible, and communicating Your beſt endeavours to the bettering of all thoſe that ſtrive to deſerve: And therefore I am confident I ſhall finde You my firme and reall Friend, to gaine that benevolence for me, for which I will ever remaine

Your faithfull ſervant, IO. IOHNSON.
