To the Right Worshipfull Sir Iohn Suckling Knight.

Sir,



OVids youngest daughter drest
in blacke, and like a mourner
drownd all in teares, doth
come to desire your favour,
that since you have honoured the Muses
with a famous Poeme, you would expresse
your noble mind in defending her from the
censure of the world. She doth not mourne
like some dissembling heire in formall
blacke, but doth shew unfained griefe for
Ovids sorrow: And though vertue doth
not alwayes runne in a blood, yet I hope

shee will not d sgrace him from whom she
did derive her birth, but rather merit tha
â€¢

my service in wayting on her to so noble a
Patron may be accepted, that while she is
entertained, I for her sake may be acknowledged,

The servant of your worthy vertues, Wye Saltonstall.
