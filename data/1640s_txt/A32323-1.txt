To his Moſt Noble and much Reverenced Friend, and Kinſman, Maſter JOHN STRVT.


Sir,


I
Doe ſo far preſume of your favor as to ſhelter theſe inſuing Lines under the ſhadow of your Protection. J, indeed, acknowledge my boldneſſe in thus intruding upon your worth, to defend my weakeneſſe.


Notwithſtanding, J am herein incouraged in part to preſume of your Pardon. The ſlender ſubject here preſented to your view, conſists of two parts, Paſſion, and Diſcretion: The firſt part, which is Paſſion, that is abſolutely mine owne: an inheritance diſcending from moſt auncient Parentage. The other, which is Diſcretion, is yours by Poſſeſsion; and due

by Deſert: in which J doe but bring the ſhadow to your Sight, of that which you have the ſubſtance in your ſelfe. In which respect it is but my duty to intitle you to that which is yours by due. Jn which kind alſo, not onely that which inſues, but that which is precedent may begge your Patronage, as part of your Inheritage.


J doe confeſſe J have imprinted the name of that noble Lady Temperance in the front of my Endeavours; but J know you will account it no diſgrace to part with ſo worthy a partner; whoſe beauties, J am confident, doe (if poſsibly they may do) As much delight your heart, as the alone Lady of your affections, doth your boſome: which can no way be imputed to wantonneſſe, but to wiſdome. For what can be of more validity to preſerve the nuptiall knot inviolate, then the ſacred tye of vertuous Temperance?

But, not any way to direct, but onely to delight you, J have thus farre incroached upon your leave. And in Fine, humbly petitioning for your favour, J reſt Yours at Command, as bound.


Edward Calver.
