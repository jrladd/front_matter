To the worthy Gentlemen, and Inhabitants of the Pariſh of St. Andrews HOLBORNE.

I Hate Ingratitude as Witchcraft. To witneſſe therefore to the world, both your curteſie to me, and my thankfulneſſe to you, I give you this Piece, intended for your Pulpit; but being occaſionally called to Grayes-Inne, delivered there what you ſhould have heard, and but once; you may pleaſe now to ſee, and often, and in it the reality of my deſire to retribute ſomething: You know what S. Peter ſaid to the Creeple, What he had hee gave him: you have been the chiefe preſervers of me and mine, ſince our eſcape out of Ireland, where we had onely our lives for a prey, and thoſe lives your bounty hath hitherto cheriſhed. Which yet, doth not more obliege me, then the loving acceptance of my weak indeavours; with which

encouragement I ſhall chearfully proceed ſtill in my poore labours, and ſhall think my ſelf amid all my misfortunes very happy, if you ſhall ſo eſteem of me as I am, and deſire to expreſſe my ſelfe,

Yours in all faire reſpect,
THO: ARTEFERTENSIS.
