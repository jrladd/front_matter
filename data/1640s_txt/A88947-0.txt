Reverend and Deare Sir,


THe right forme of Church Government being
more ſearched into of late time then formerly,
and your ſelf amongſt others having written for
the governing power, or juriſdiction of Synods,
over particular Churches: We therfore knowing our ſelves
bound as well as others, to try all things, and hold faſt that
which is good, have conſidered as the Lord hath holpen us;
thoſe Arguments of yours which are contained in your
Book, againſt the Indepency of Churches; and not being
ſatisfied therewith, your Book being publiſhed in Print; we
have therfore thought meet, in like fort to publiſh our Anſwer,
and in that way to ſhew unto your ſelf and others,
what yet hinders us, that we do not think your Arguments
to be convincing. In which attempt we have bin the more
encouraged by your profeſſion (which we dare not but believe)
that in what you have written, you have aimed at verity,
and not at victory; wherof we are the rather perſwaded,
becauſe we do perceive your whole diſcourſe to be carried
along without paſsion and bitterneſſe, in a ſpirit of meekneſſe
and love, which alſo we are willing to acknowledge before
all men, to your juſt commendation, and the glory of
that grace of God that gives you ſuch an heart. And it is
our hope, that ſith you profeſse to aim at the truth, and do
diſpute with ſuch a ſpirit, as if you meant ſo indeed; that
therfore it will not be unacceptable to you, if any weakneſse
be diſcovered in thoſe grounds wheron you build this perſwaſion,
that in the preſent Question, the truth doth ſtand
on your ſide. And as your Book doth breathe forth a ſpirit

of meekneſse, ingenuity and love; ſo we hope you will find,
that we have aimed at the like in our Anſwer; which as
we have written and now publiſhed it for the truths ſake;
and for the help of thoſe that cannot attaine unto larger,
and more learned Treatiſes about this Subject; So in ſpeciall
manner in love to your ſelf, and our deare Country
men & friends, as in other places of Lancaſhire, ſo in your
Pariſh of Winwick, wherin one of us was born, and the
other was for ſundry Years together an unworthy Miniſter
of the Goſpel of Chriſt. Accept therfore we doe beſeech
you, this brotherly labour of ours, which here we ſend you,
divided into theſe few Chapters. We are alſo willing upon
this occaſion, to teſtifie our thankfullnes for that loving reſpect
which we found from you, when we lived together in
that Country; when you were pleaſed to own us in our ſad
times. The Father of mercies be with you, and with all
thoſe that love the truth in ſincerity; and bleſſe that Reverend
and Grave Aſſembly, wherof we hear your ſelf are a
Member, that by their wiſe and holy indeavours, the truth
may be cleared, and all corruptions removed in the Doctrine,
Worſhip, and Church Government in ENGLAND,
to his praiſe and glory; and the comfort of all thoſe who unfainedly
deſire that the Crowne of Chriſt Ieſus, and the
Scepter of the Son of God, may be gloriouſly advanced over
all; which is the prayer of

Your Loving Brethren,
RICHARD MATHER,
and
WILLIAM TOMPSON.
