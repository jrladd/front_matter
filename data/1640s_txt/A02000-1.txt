To
The right illuſtrious Lord,
Micer Franciſco Bonnet, Viceroy
of Catalunna, and
Counſellour of
Barcelona.

RIght reverend Sir,
being of opinion, that
the ſubject of this
booke, intituled the
Galateo Eſpanol,
is of great importance, and of much
furtherance, to know how, and in
what manner, men ought (ordinarily)
to carry themſelves, ſo that
they be not only not ill thought of,
and hated of others, But very acceptable,
and pleaſing to all: and
conſidering on the other ſide, that
for want of Copies thereof, the
common wealth looſeth this ſo great
a good. I determined to print it

at my owne charge. Becauſe that it
is not now in my power, or ability,
to doe things of greater importance,
I have (at leaſt) done what
I could in this little: and as much
as my skill would reach unto. Afterward
taking it into my conſideration
unto whom I were beſt to
dedicate it, as the cuſtome is to
doe, in the like impreſſions of
bookes; my phanſy then gave me, that
I could not better dedicate it, to any
body then your honour, who with
greater zeale and thought, deſireth,
& procureth, the good of this ſame
common wealth then any other, (as
all doe well ſee, & confeſſe) as well
in the charge of a Counſellour, as in
that of a deputy, which your honour
houlds, at the preſent, and doth
order, and governe there in with
ſo great diligence. Therefore I truſt,
that your honour will bee pleaſed,
to receive it under your protection:
and although the ſervice bee not
ſuch, as is fit for the perſon of your

Honour, yet receive the heart and
good will, with which it is offered,
together with the deſire I
have, to ſerve your Honour, and the
common wealth, (dayly) more and
more, in matters of greater conſequence:
for by this favour, and
reward, I recover more heart, and
vigour, to undertake, and finiſh
a greater worke. God keepe your
Lordſhip.

Right illuſtrious Sir,
Bernat Cuſana kiſſes your
Honours hands.
