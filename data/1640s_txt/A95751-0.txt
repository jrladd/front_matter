TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, And moſt noble LADY, My deare and loving Mother, the Lady DOWAGER of Cromartie.


MADAM,


FILIALL duty being the more binding in me, that I doe owe it to the beſt of Mothers; if in the diſcharge thereof I obſerve not the uſuall manner of other ſonnes, I am the leſſe to blame, that their obligation is not ſo great as mine: Therefore in that doe

preſume to imprint your Ladiſhips name in the Frontiſpiece of this Book, and proffer unto you a Dedication of that, which is beyond the capacity of other Ladies; my boldneſſe therein is the more excuſable, that in your perſon the moſt vertuous Woman in the world is intreated to Patronize that, which by the learnedeſt men may happily be peruſed.
I am confident (Madam) that your gracious acceptance of this Preſent is the more eaſily obtainable, in that it is a grand-child of your own, whom I thus make tender of, to be ſheltered under the favor of your protection; and that unto your Ladiſhip it will not be the more unwelcome, for proceeding from the braines of him, whoſe body is not more yours by generation, then by a moſt equitable purchaſe are the faculties of his mind; the dominion which over my better halfe you, by your goodneſſe, have acquired, being, in regard of my obedience, no leſſe voluntary, then that of the other is for procreation naturall.

Thus (Madam) unto you doe I totally belong, but ſo, as that thoſe exteriour parts of mine, which by birth are from your Ladiſhip derived, cannot be more fortunate in this their ſubjection (notwithſtanding the egregious advantages of bloud, and

conſanguinity thereby to them accruing) then my ſelfe am happy (as from my heart I doe acknowledge it) in the juſt right, your Ladiſhip hath to the eternall poſſeſsion of the never-dying powers of my ſoule. For, though (Soveraignty excepted) there be none in this Iſland more honourably deſcended then is your Ladiſhip, nor whoſe progenitors, theſe many ages paſt, have been (on either ſide) of a more Noble extraction: Yet, laying apart Nobility, beauty, wealth, parentage, and friends, which (together with many other gifts of fortune) have hitherto ſerved to adorn your Ladiſhip beyond others of your ſex, who for all theſe have been deſervedly renowned; and (in ſome meaſure) not eſteeming that properly to be yours, the receiving whereof did not altogether depend upon your owne election: it is the treaſure of thoſe excellent graces, wherewith inwardly you are enriched, that, in praiſing of your Ladiſhip is moſt to be pitch'd upon, and for the which you are moſt highly to be commended; ſeeing by the means of them, you, from your tendereſt yeeres upwards, untill this time, in the ſtate of both 
Ʋirginity and Matrimony, have ſo conſtantly, and indefatigably proceeded in the courſe of vertue, with ſuch alacrity fixed your gallant thoughts on the ſweetneſſe

thereof, and thereunto ſo firmly and cheerefully devoted all your words and actions, as if righteouſneſſe in your Ladiſhip had been an inbred quality, and that in your Will there had beene no aptitude of declining from the way of reaſon.
This much is ſufficiently well known to thoſe, that have at any time enjoyed the honour of your Ladiſhips converſation, by whoſe moſt unpartiall reports, the Splendour of your reputation is both in this, and foraine Nations accounted precious, in the minds even of thoſe, that have never ſeen you. But in ſo much more eſpecially, doe the moſt judicious of either ſex admire the rare and ſublime endowments, wherewith your Ladiſhip is qualified, that (as a patterne of perfection, worthy to be univerſally followed) other Ladies (of what dignity ſoever) are truly by them eſteemed of the choiſer merit, the nearer they draw to the Paragon propoſed, and reſemble your Ladiſhip; for that, by vertue of your beloved ſociety, your neighbouring Counteſſes, and other greater Dames of your kindred and acquaintance, become the more illuſtrious in your imitation; amidſt whom, as Cynthia amongſt the obſcurer Planets, your Ladiſhip ſhines, and darteth the Angelick rayes of your matchleſſe example

on the ſpirits of thoſe, who by their good Genius have been brought into your favourable preſence to be enlightned by them.
Now (Madam) leſt, by inſiſting any longer upon this ſtraine, I ſhould ſeeme to offend that modeſty, and humility, which (without derogating from your heroick vertues) are ſeated in a conſiderable place of your ſoule, I will here, in all ſubmiſsion, moſt humbly take my leave of your Ladiſhip, and beſeech Almighty God, that it may pleaſe his Divine Majeſty ſo to bleſſe your Ladiſhip with continuance of dayes, that the ſonnes of thoſe whom I have not as yet begot, may attaine to the happineſſe of preſenting unto your Ladiſhip a brain-babe of more ſufficiencie and conſequence; and that your Ladiſhip may live with as much health, and proſperity, to accept thereof, and cheriſh it then, as (I hope) you doe now, at your vouchſafing to receive this, which (though diſproportionable, both to your Ladiſhips high deſerts, and to that fervencie of willingneſſe in me, ſometime to make offer of what is of better worth, and more ſutable to the grandour of your acceptance) in all ſincerity of heart (confiding in that candour and ingenuity, wherby your Ladiſhip is accuſtomed to value gifts,

according to the intention of the giver) and in all duty, and lowlineſſe of mind, together with my ſelfe in whole, and all my beſt endeavours, I tender unto your Ladiſhip, as becometh, (Madam)


Your Ladiſhips moſt affectionate Sonne and humble ſervant, THOMAS URQUHART.
