TO THE RIGHT Honourable, my very good LORD, WILLIAM Earle of SALISBURY, One of the LORDS of his Majeſties moſt honorable privy Councell, and Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the GARTER.

WHereas the manage of a real war, is now familiarly every mans Tract, the premiſes unconſulted, and our proviſional Muſters and Militia ſtil left at large, without any Paraphraſe: my neare and uſuall privitie with them both thus impoſing; I have here propounded for ſome ſuch temper, as might render each to be faire and flouriſhing: Neither

can it bee preſented with more propriety, then to the maſterwheele, from whoſe courſe and influence, my ſubordinate motion hath ſucceeded. And may your Lordſhip deigne it a favourable regard; I dare be bold (how defective perhaps in ſeverall particulars) it ſhall yet induce ſo much diſcourſe, and contemplation, as by hammering out infallible rules, may requiſitely mature both. Finally, your gracious acceptation, of ſo meane a piece; will, beyond the many favours formerly collated, ſtil lay a further obligation, upon

Your Lordſhips ever bounden Servant,
GEORGE TOOKE.
