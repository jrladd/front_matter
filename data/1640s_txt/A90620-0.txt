ANOTHER TO HER
HIGHNESSE.


I Doe not dedicate theſe to delight
Or profit you, both are the Authors right:
Nor is it that your Highneſſe may protect
My part, it merits not ſo much reſpect;
Nor that you may examine and compare,
It leſſe deſerves ſuch ſerious Princely care:
Nor is it gratitude, becauſe y' have been
Pleas'd to approve ſome others you have ſeen:
Since retribution ſo farre below
Proportion, would be worſe then ſtill to owe:
Nor vanity, that thus I may have leave
To tell the world the honour I receive,
In that my name hath reacht your ſacred eare:
I hate that emptie vice; yet need not feare


The cenſure, were it juſt ſince 't would make proud
The ſtaideſt thoughts to be by you allow'd.
If any aske me, What is then my end?
'Tis to approve my ſelfe a reall friend
To chaſte Lauretta, whom ſince I have tane
From the dark Cloyſter, where ſhe did remain
Unmarkt, becauſe unknown, my aime is now
To make her happy, by attending you:
Where ſhe may ſee her trueſt worth outgone,
And learn more vertue then ſhe yet hath known


The humbleſt of your
Highneſſe ſervants
ANNA HUME.
