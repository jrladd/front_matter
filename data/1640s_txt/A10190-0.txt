TO
THE HIGH AND
HONOVRABLE
COURT OF PARLIAMENT, THE
NOBILITIE AND GENTRIE NOVV
Assembled in both the Houses, Grace, Mercy
and Peace be multiplyed.

MOST Noble Senare, and right worthy Pattiots, who
both feare your GOD, and honour your King; He
who truly honours you, and dayly prayes for a blessed
successe of this your Meeting, humbly presents you
here with a Cause, which well weighed in your maturest
judgements, may prove one of those greatest
Parliament Businesses, which your most pious and prudent thoughts
and Consultations are taken up withall. When you have perused this
short Discourse concerning Prelaticall Authority, whence it is, and
if it shall appeare by cleare evidence of Scripture, justly compared with
their Prelaticall properties, and practises, that they are the Seed of
Antichrist, the Mystery of Iniquity; a more then Heathenish Tyranny
over Soules, bodies, and estates; a meere enmity (but under the
veile of Hypoerisie) against Christ, against his Word, against his Ministers,
against his People, and the Salvation of their Soulee; yea against
the peace and prosperity of Civil States, by their Factious and Seditious
practises, and the like: Your Wisdome, your Piety, your Zeale for
GOD, your Love to Christ, your Loyalty to your King, your tender
compassion towards your poore Country, your Christian care of your own
Soules, and of your Posterities, will all of them call and cry for a serious
Consultation, and a speedy resolution what is to be done herein, as you

shall apprehend the Prosperity, or Calamity of this whole Church and
State, and the happy or miserable issues of Parlliaments to depend upon
it. A word to the wise. What I would further say, I will turne into
continuall Supplication to the Great President of Councels JESUS
CHRIST, that he will send his Spirit of Wisdome and Vnderstanding,
the Spirit of Councel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge,
and the Feare of the Lord: that Antichrists throne being quite cast
out, and Christs alone set up, the King may be established in perpetuall
Peace and Prosperity to himselfe and Royall Posterity, 'till the
coming of Him, who shall put an end to Times and Kingdomes; and
with whom all that truly serve him here, shall raigne for evermore.

Your Honours and Worships
faithfull Orator till death.
