TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE the LORDS and others of His MAIESTIES moſt Honourable Privy Councell.

ACcording to Your Honours command wee have enquired and conſidered how the Mines-Royall were left to Maſter Buſhell by the Lady Middleton, and doe in all humility declare, that the ſilver mines were not worth the working, untill Maſter Buſhell at his great charge diſcovered Rich Ore in the adjacent mountaines, which in all likelihood will both increaſe the Bullion & by his way of working, in ſhort time give his Majeſty a true tryall what the invaluable riches of theſe His Welſh mountaines are: for whereas the Mines in theſe parts were formerly wrought by Pumpes, and ſo growing deepe were left drowned with water, M. Buſhell cuts through the maine Rockes, at the loweſt levell, to an hundred fathome perpendicular, according to the German manner of working, which though chargeable, yet certaine, having foure ſeverall Addits which hee continueth driving day and night into foure ſeverall mountaines, his induſtry alſo hath

outſtript former times, for by melting the poore fuſible Ore, with the Rich, he produceth a third part more of ſilver with the ſame charge: and for accommodating the workes with all materials fit for Mines Royall, he hath ſpared no coſt about repairing the milles, hath alſo built in his Majeſties Caſtle of Aberyſtwith a faire mint, hath contracted with merchants of our owne and other Nations to ſupply the peoples neceſſity with Corne and other proviſions, and payeth the miners and carriers at the Scales, and doubteth not to make them able Pyoners, and fit ſouldiers to doe His Majeſty and their Country ſervice upon any aſſault of an enemy. All which we commend to Your Honourable conſideration, praying, &c.


Your Lordſhips humbly to be commanded,


Joſeph Hexſteter, chiefe Steward of the Mines.

Samuel Reyniſh, Aſſay Maſters of the Mint.

Water Barkesby, Aſſay Maſters of the Mint.

Humphrey Owen, Clarke of the Mines.
