Berkley, Mowbray, Segrave, and

Noble Order of the
BATH.

My LORD:


I Doe here once more present
your Lordship, with the fruit
of my leasure studies, as a testimony
of my readinesse to serve you,
in those sacred matters, to which I devote
my more serious houres. I should
not have presumed to this Dedication,

had I not beene encouraged by that generousnesse
and sweetnesse of disposition,
which does so eminently adorne
your Lordships place and abilities.
If your Lordship please to excuse this
boldnesse, and to vouchsafe this Pamphlet
a shelter under your favourable
patronage, you shall thereby incourage
me in those higher studies, which may
be more agreeable to that relation,
wherein I stand, as being
Your Lordships servant
