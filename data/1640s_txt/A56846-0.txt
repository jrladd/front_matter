BEpleased to cast a gracious eye upon this Book, and at Your leasure (if Your Royall imployments lend you any) to peruse it.
In Your Three Kingdoms, You have three sorts of people: The first, confident and faithfull; The second, diffident and fearfull; The third, indifferent and doubtfull.
The first are with You in their Persons, Purses, (or desires) and good wishes.
