TO THE VERTVOVS
CARINDA.

MADAM,


IT was your pleaſure not long ſince
to admit me into your Ladiſhips
preſence, where I tooke the boldneſſe
to begin a diſcourſe of the
Planets, and to declare the power
of them: which conference d
•
d
ariſe from the death of Sir Thomas Wentworth,
who departed this world in his Clymactericall
yeare. A friend of mine being at the place
of execution, heard a pittifull Lady warble forth
a mournfull duty; and as ſoone as her eyes beheld
his head parted from his ſhoulders, ſhe uttered
theſe words with teares in her eyes, (O what
wit, treſon, harmes) which being examined,
were the true letters of (Six Thomas Wentworth)
without adding or taking away of a letter.
Well might ſhe confidently affirme what ſhe
ſaid, ſince none will deny, but that the cutting off
the head ſpoyles the wit. I have according
to your Ladiſhips command, ſent you this dream

of the Lord of Strafford, in regard formerly you
have been pleaſed to lend an eare to my tedious
relation; the which is included within a ſmall
treatiſe, ſtiled, the Divine Dreamer, together
with the ſervice
Of your Servant
GONZALO.
