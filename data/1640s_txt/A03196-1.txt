TO THE EXCELLENTLY DISPOSED MISTRIS ELIZABETH THE VERTVOVS CONSORT OF CLOVILL TANFIELD OF COPT-FOLD HALL, IN ESSEX (Esquire.) The memorable Acts of these nine most worthy Ladies are humbly presented by T. H.


Excellent Creature,


THat I presume to approach so faire a shrine with so meane an offering, accept not (I pray) my unworthinesse but your owne worthy deservings; borrowing your unspotted name to usher in these nine most incomparable Ladies; neither is it improper, but rather materiall, for modesty and chastitie best accommodates

magnanimity & courage; all vertuall decorements consists not in masculine spirited Viragoes, some of your sex being for their beautie beloved, some again more for their inward vertues, then outward features affected; as virgins for their chast and modest indowments; wives for the love and care they have to preserve their conjugall tie untainted, some widdowes for their wisedome, and grave matrons for their gravitie; now in this misselany of your so much magnified sex, where you shall finde one excellently pollisht; it is in your choyse to make her your president; or if any for too much boldnesse branded, you may use her as a vaile to make your owne vertues shew the more conspicuous, for contrarieties in coulers best sets off each others luster; thus after a particular acknowledgment of my dutie and service, with pardon craved for my too much boldnesse I remaine yours.


In all observance obliged, Tho. Haywood.
