TO The Reverend Mr. John Arrowſmith Maſter of St. Iohns Colledge in Cambridge.


BUt that (Worthy Sir) you know as well how to pardon

as judge, I might juſtly ſuſpect your entertainment of theſe peices. Faint breathings of a minde burthened with other Literary employments, neither brought forth with Care, nor ripened with Age, yet ſuch as if they bee not now blaſted may be the firſt Fruits of a larger

Harveſt; Let them Sir, Receive the honour and ſhelter of your Name, ſince borne under your Government, and cheriſht by your Candor; That if they chance to ſurvive their Father, they may teſtify hee was Sir

Your moſt humble Servant, J. HALL.
