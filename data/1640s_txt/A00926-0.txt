To the truly Noble, and
Vertuous Lady, The Lady
Nevill Brooke.


Madame,


BEhold my one weeks
Meditation, which
is yours all the yeer;
so I presume it may
not come unseasonable to you
now, though that dolorous time
be past, and a more joyfull one
ensued▪ Even so it is, by the

way of sorrow, we must arive to
joy, which none in the next life
can perfectly participate of
with our Saviour Christ, without
part of his paine and sufferings
in this, Though not by
Passion, yet by Compassion at
least▪ So, where the effect
wants, if the will want not, it
is sufficient.
You (Madam) are (we
know) of more Eminency of
Fortune, then to feele the one,
but of such Eminent devotion,
as the other you are not without

tender feeling of, which makes
me with more Confidence, approach
this to your fair hands,
who yeild to none, in truly honouring
you,

RICH: FLECKNOI
