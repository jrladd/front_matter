TO THE HONOVRABLE Houſe of COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.


VEſtrum eſt imperare, noſtrum obſequi: Your Commands wraped up in your Deſires I have deſired to obey, both to the Pulpit and the Preſſe. Not that I can tender any thing either to your eares or eyes, which may be worth your acceptance, but that I cannot but moſt readily tender obedience when you command,

and labour to ſerve you, when you call for my ſervice. The ſubject of that houres Diſcourſe that I had then before you, and of this Booke, which is the ſame, was very well worthy your eyes and eares, if the managing of it had but fallen into a skilfull hand; [For what more needfull duty to bee urged or to be practiſed, then Heart-communication.] But according to my poverty I was then ready to offer, and you were pleaſed to accept; and I hope for the like acceptance now. I humbly recommended the words then ſpoken to your hearts, and ſo I doe now the ſame written: and as I deſire to preſent them now written to your hands, ſo doe I my ſelfe, and all I am or can at your feet; as

Your poore humble devoted
Servant,
J. L.
