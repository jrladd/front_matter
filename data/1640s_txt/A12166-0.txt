TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE IOHN, LORD ROBERTS, Baron of Truro: AND TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE THE LADY LVCE his pious Consort, Grace and Peace from Jesus Christ.

Right Honourable and truly Noble:


IT was not so much the Nobility of your blood, as that of Grace given unto you from the divine hand, which did so much interest you in the love and esteeme of that worthy Servant of Christ, and Author of this worke; in whomâ–ª Vrim and Thummim met, whose whole course being a reall, and

vitall sermon, sweetly consonant to the tenour of his teaching, made him amiable living, and honourable dead in the opinion of as many as well knew him: This was the thing (I suppose) which wrought unto him from you (as well as from many others of your Noble Stock and Ranke) more then an ordinary esteeme: and this is that which maketh me in nothing to doubt, but that his labours made publique under your names, shall be very welcome unto you: the worke is answering unto the man; and therefore worthy you, and your acceptance: onely this is the disadvantage; that though these Sermons had his owne toung to preach them; yet they

want his owne pen to commend them unto your Honours: I well know that the expressions of holy truthes from a gratious heart by lively voice doe breed deeper impressions in thirsting and reverent hearers, then any publishing of them in dead letters can doe; yet this we finde in experience, that holy and necessary truths, this way comming abroad into the Churches of God, doe get the advantage to continue longer, and to become a more generall good; they may stirre up the affections, and set on-wards in the course of holinesse where the comforts are sure, and the honours honouring everlasting.
In these ensuing Sermons you

have variety the mother of delight; and such notable descriptions of the person, offices, love, and life of Christ, that by them you may not only be setled in divine assurances to your further comforts, but also directed and incouraged (both in your inward and outward conversation) to follow the example of Christ, the most blessed and unerring example unto all Christians. This Champion I beseech you both to follow unto your lives end; make it your worke to set up Christ, and his Religion both in your hearts, and in your houses. Acknowledge none but Christ in matter of salvation; and none to Christ in point of affection: let Christ

be Christ with you, and then if Christ (and if not Christ nothing can) be worth any thing he will make you worthy indeed, he will proove unto you in life and death a Sun, a shield, even a full and an answerable good: with this Christ I leave you, and with you these ensuing Sermons, to be read and observed for your spirituall furtherance in the enjoyment of eternall life by Iesus Christ, desiring the great God of Heaven and Earth to looke upon both you and yours in much grace and mercie; giving unto you all the comfort and crown of Religion here on earth; and hereafter in Heaven. I rest,

Your honours to be commanded JOHN SEDOVVICK.
