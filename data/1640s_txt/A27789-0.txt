TO
The High and Honourable Court
OF
PARLIAMENT.

An Epigram.

GReat Senatours, I ow devoutest pray'rs,
For both the Houses honourable chairs,
Their Orders furthering these Psalm-affairs.


I know not yet, what friendship got between
Hath set me downe so far behinde the screen,
That scarce enough I may be heard or seen.


But if I can appeare, I may appeal,
And venture something for the Churches weal,
In some case it is capitall to conceal.


I dare not parley, but I dare protest,
I aim God should be served with the best;
The judgement is referred to your brest.


Your beams are bright, and day light doth appear,


The text and the translation both are here;
Judge by the clock of your judicious ear.


Then cherish vertue with a gracious face.
If either do excell, give that the place;
If both have done alike, give both their grace.


So shall great Academies crown our brows,
With learned lawrell: And they shall allow's
To voice your votes, & say y'have paid your vows.


Great Chronicles shall also blase your Name,
And set it burning in a lampe of fame,
Guilding your just acts with its shining flame.
