TO THE
Honorable and Illustrious Assembly the
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the
Commons House of PARLIAMENT.

THE admirable and incomparable
Virtues of this Magneticall Medicine
(having passed, as the pure and
well refined Gold, many perfect Examinations)
now presenteth it Self
to your Noble Hands, humbly craving your Honorable
protection of this usefull Medicine: It is amply
accommodated with warrantble Testimonies to
be the alone Phoenix and Miracle of all Physicall Miracles
the Elixer of Life, the Balsame of Nature; It
containeth Mystically and Essentially the quintessence
of all Mineralls and Vegitables, and Magnetically
Sympathizeth with all Animals, It is in Materiall
composition, as being compounded in due proportioned
Number, Weight and Measure, an Abstract or Compendium
of this Elementary World: It is Extracted
from the choysest and purest Mineralls, and Mettals;
It is Animated by Coelestiall Influences, It is sanctified
and Metaphysically indowed with Excellent Virtues

by the alone worker of all miriacles, from whom every
good and perfect gift proceedeth: This my Magneticall
medicine is distinct in Nature, Compositions and
Qualities, and transcendent in Effects and Virtues
from the common Regulus of Antimony, whereof
violent and pernitious Antimoniall Cups are commonly
made and vulgarly vended, The medicinall Virtues,
by me declared to be herein Essentially permanent,
are Experimentally approved and found to be most
certain and true; This is a healthfull medicine
without having or leaving any evill qualities or malignant
Effects after the taking thereof, as I shall answer
before God & Man. Wherefore in full assurance
and confidence of the Excellency & safety of this magneticall
medicine, I humbly present and subject this
pretious Jewell to to your Honorable Just Censure and
Judegment, earnestly praying that it may obtain with
you such credit, esteem and acceptation, as the true
worth of it shall really merit. And thus humbly and
devoutly imploring from the alone giver of all permanent
Graces, upon you and yours a plentifull multiplication
of all terrene beatitudes, heavenly Indowments,
and Coelestiall Glories, with his promised reward for
constant Faihfulnesse, which is a Crown of Life; So
earnestly prayeth.

your Honours most humbly Devoted.
JOHN EVANS.
