TO HIS HONOVRED FRIEND WILLIAM DICONSON ESQUIRE.

SIR,


AFter I had once well relished the sweetnesse of your conversation; having calculated your temper and disposition according to the meridian of Friendship, I soone proposed you to my selfe as an Idea and patterne of all Humanity. This

apprehension I have of your virtues, is so deeply setled in my understanding, that I finde it difficult to restraine affection from dilating upon this Argument, even to a Panegyrique: Yet I confesse I doe not more truly honour and revere you under any one notion, as I doe in that relation you stand in to my worthy Friend your Son, a relation which you have made more reverend and amiable, by the felicity of your comportment. There, Nature and Education are in their Zeniths. This is the Achma of worldly Beatitudes, when by a reciprocall invention, without the confusion

of distance and proximity, reverence and affection; there results by converse, Idem Alter, & Alter Idem: were not this a truth that hath oft beene visible to discerning eyes, I might be thought a little to play the Poet, and this assertion taken for an Allegory. Sir, the congruity of this Art, with your Nature, in gaining upon the affections of men, hath made me pitch upon you as a competent Iudge and Patron: To you therefore I consecrate this Fruit of my Hand, as to one well read in the prudentiall Laws of Civill Conversation, and by consequence knowing, to manage

the Hand, of your Intellect and Reason (your reason and speech) to the best advantage and utterance of discretion and honesty. Be pleased in returne of those expresses of your affection and respect I have received from you, to accept of this demonstration of respect from him, who is

Your faithfull friend to command, IO. BULVVER.
