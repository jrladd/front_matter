To the Right Honourable the Lord Vicount SAY and SEALE, and Lieutenant Generall CROMWEL.

Noble Patriots,



IF I miſtake not, you may here ſingle out ſomthing of the Lords from what is mine, and diſcerne ſome beames of God amongſt many things of man. I know the candle of the Lord cannot ſhine any where with more ſnuff then in me; however ſince the Lord hath lighted it, I dare not but let it ſhine (or rather glimmer) before men. I have writ your Names to my Book that I may be one of your Remembrancers amongſt the reſt to the advancement of Truth; not but they who know ye, know ye to be acted by a Spirit of Truth in your ſelves. The Lord remember ye according to all the good ye have done (in your ſeverall Miniſtrations) to this people; and do that for ye which gives you moſt, and yet takes moſt from ye, even filling ye with himſelf; till he hath emptied ye of all but his own glory, and gathered ye up into the fulneſſe and righteouſneſſe of himſelfe in Chriſt, where we are only nothing in our ſelves, and every thing in him; and ſurely the moſt, and beſt and greateſt thing he can do for the ſons of men, is, thus to make them nothing in their own account, that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord. I may ſeeme ſtrange to wiſh ye thus; but I know it is not ſtrange to ye, who know the Myſtery of the Spirit, and of Chriſt.

My Lord, and Sir, Go on ſtill, yet ſtill laying your deſignes in a glory above that of States and Kingdomes, and involving all your Counſels there, where there is moſt of Heaven, and leaſt of the world.
So praies,
Your Servant in the Lord,
IOHN SALTMARSH.
