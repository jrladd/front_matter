TO
The Right Worſhipfull his
ever Honoured worthy Friend, Sir
PHILIP CARTERET Knight, Lieutenant
Governour and Bayliffe of the Iſle
of Jerſy.

SIR, Your great Favour and Humanity
To Me whiles Exile, Priſner in Jerſy,

Wholy ſecluded from all Friends acceſſe,
Under the angry Frownes of their Greatneſſe
Who ſent Me thither, to deprive me quite
Of worldly Comforts; challenge a juſt Right
To theſe rude Meditations, which there grew,
And ſo in Juſtice are your proper Due.
Accept them than, as a ſmall Pledge of my
Thankes unto You, till Oportunity
And better Dayes, enable me to finde,
Some other meanes to pay all that's behinde.

Your Eternally Obliged
Friend and Servant
WILLIAM PRYNNE.
