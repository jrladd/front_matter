TO THE HONOVRABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMONS House assembled at OXFORD.


Honourable Senatours,


I Doe here most humbly present uncovered to your judicious view, a Sermon once Preached, and afterward dedicated to your selves at Westminster: as it was at first an unhappy mean, to provoke divers (then of your society) to set their feet in paths of blood: so if now it shall help to a fuller sight, of the greatnesse of that mercy, which preserved your selves from so great a danger, I have also my option. There be Misteries of Iniquity as well as of Godlinesse, a Ministers duty is to discover both; our Saviour revealed Satan when he spake by Peters tongue, and thereby taught us to detect him, when he comes in the shape of an Angell of light; (as his custome is to do, when he is endeavouring most mischiefe against Church or State) the most eminent, popular, and well-guifted men, have alwayes beene his instruments to pervert the Truth, and to breake the Peace; he doth but actum agere in these times; omne malum ab Ecclesia, was true of old, and is so still: They were Church-men to whom that Rebell Rodolphus spake, (when lying on his death-bed he shewed his right hand cut off in fight against his Soveraigne: This (saies he) is that right hand, wherewith I vowed my faith unto the Emperour, now is the same become a witnesse of my breach of fidelity, and traiterous attempts against my Soveraigne by your instigation. They were also Church-men that stirred up to the Barrons warres, in the daies of our Henry 3. and injoyned

the Earle of Leicester in remissione peccatorum, ut causam illam (meaning his Rebellion) usquè ad mortem assumeret, asserting, pacem Ecclesiae Anglicanae nun quàm sine gladio materiali posse firmari. Our age (alasse) hath beene too fruitfull in such Churchmen; and they in such Assertions; but the Apostle prophecying of such sayes, that their folly shall be manifested unto all; and to this purpose (right Noble and Worthy) are my poore endeavours in this following discourse, I humbly beg, that your favourable acceptance; may make the same in some sort valuable: it tends to Peace, and you are Councellours of Peace, to a King of Peace, no way delighting in bloud, rather wishing with Theodosius, se potuisse mortuos à morte revocare. Indeed He is our Theodosius, Gods guift to us; and you are his Theodosii, God's guifts to him: and as such, we (his inferiour Loyall Subjects) do most sincerely honour you. And be confident (Grave Senatours) what ever hath beene suggested heretofore (by any of those Boutefeu's,) that assisting him the Annointed of the Lord, and true possessor of the mild and gracious spirit of the Lord, you do most really and truly help the Lord himselfe: and if your care shall adde some further edge to His most pious Orders, and Proclamations against Swearing, and Prophaning Gods Name and Word; and for the more strict observing the Lords day, and dayes of Fasting (appointed by His Majesty, yet much neglected in His Quarters;) you shall fit a people for the Lord, to shew mercy upon, and to restore that peace unto, which you labour for: yea, and thereby not onely your Consultations, but your Persons, shall continually be attended with Gods blessing; and your Names had with Posterity in an everlasting joyfull remembrance; for this Honour have all his Saints. And that the same may be an unseperable portion to every of you, is, and shall be the constant, and earnest prayer of


Your humble Se
