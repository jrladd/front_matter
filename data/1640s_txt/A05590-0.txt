TO THE TRVLY NOBLE MAGNANIMOVS AND ILLUSTRIOUS LORD, IAMES, EARLE OF MONTROSE, Lord GRAHAME, Baron of MURDOCK, &c.

Illustrious LORD,


IF gratefull duetie, may be reputed the childe of reason, then (doubtlesse) my choisest wishes, and best Affection, must here fall prostrate before your auspicuous and friendlie face, fast chayned, in the



fetters of obedience. Flatterie and Ingratitude I disdayne as hell: And to court your Lo: with elegant phrases, were indeed as much as who would light a Candle, to light the Sunne: Your Noble and Heroicke Vertues light this Kingdome, and who can give them light: For, as the Aurore, of your honoured reputation, is become that Constantinopolitan Hyppodrome, to this our Northrene and virgine Albion; so lykewise, the same singularitie of worth, hath raised your auspicuous selfe, to be the monumentall glorie of your famous, and valiant Predecessours, iustly tearmed, THE SWORD OF SCOTLAND: Your morning of their Summers day hath fullie enlarged, the sacred Trophees of their matchlesse memorie; best befitting the generositie of your magnanimous minde. That as the GRAHAME, from long antiquitie, being the most ancient surname, of this unconquered Nation; so they, your old



aged Ancestors, have left a lineall construction of their Valour and Worthinesse, to bee inherent in your most hopefull personage, which God may long continue to you, your Race, and your Posteritie. My humble request, pleads the continuance of your favour, that as your late renowned Grand-father and Father, were unto mee both friendlie and favourable (proceeding from their great goodnesse, not my deserts;) so expect I the same from your tender bountie, which hitherto beyond my merit, hath beene exceeding kyndlie manifested. For the which, my prayse and prayers, the two sisters of myne Oblation, rest solidlie ingenochiated at the feete of your conspicuous Clemencie. This present worke in its secret Infancie, was both seene and perused by your Lo: but now enlarged, polished, and published: I have done my best, though not my uttermost: The discourse it selfe, runneth most on



the causes, conditions, and remedies of sin, and they sharply linked in generalls and particulars: The whole substance of my labours, sealing vp the happinesse of a sinners conversion to God, under the mourning Cannopie, of Teares, and Repentance. The lynes are plaine, yet pithie; and although the subject may carrie no loftie nor PoÃ«ticke style; yet themanner, the matter, the Man, and his Muse, are all, and only yours, and I left theirs, onlie to serve you, and your noble disposition. Accept therefore my good Lord, both the gift, and givers minde, with the same alacritie, as I offer them in Love and humilitie; which being shelterd under your pious and prudent Patronage, shall enforce mee to remaine, as I vow ever to be, whilst I have being,

Your Honours most obsequious and most obser vant Oratour, WILLIAM LITHGOVV.
