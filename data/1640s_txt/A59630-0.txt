TO THE WORSHIPFVLL his very Worthy Friend, RICHARD KNIGHTLEY ESQUIRE.

Worthy Sir,


MY purpose was, that (without any addition or alteration) this small Treatise should have passed, as I had formerly composed it: but finding somewhat that I judged useful, to the easier attaining of the Art, which before was omitted; at the request of diverse of good judgement, I was perswaded rather to adventure the breach of that promise, than to conceale that which might be usefull to many.
The manifold ingagements I stand in to your Worship, require a better retribution; but your favorable aspect to one as little deserving, hath enboldned me to crave of your Worship to countenance this, and the rather because

your experience in the Art, hath already encouraged many to the study of it.
I dare not so much injure your Worships vertuous inclination, as to feare the acceptance of this poore expression of my thankefullnesse, seeing it is not unknown to your Worship, nor to many thousands beside, that it hath beene instrumentall for the good of the Church, and the perpetuating the memories (as the smell of Lebanon) of many worthy men, who, though they now rest from their labours, and their works have followed them: yet by this meanes the fruit of their labours is continued with us. I desire your Worship to pardon my boldnesse; and to pray for the increase of all blessings on your Worship, shall be the imployment of

Your Worships to be commanded, THO. SHELTON.
