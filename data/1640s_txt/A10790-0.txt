TO
The true Heroine
Lady, the Lady
DOROTHY
SYDNEY,
The HEROINAE are
humbly p
••
sented
by
G. RIVERS,
To receive Fame
from her Favour.

Madam,


THat I approach
so faire a
Shrine with
so course an Offering;

accuse not my unworthinesse,
but your owne
worth; which like a
Load-star is pleas'd to
attract the coursest mettle,
to make knowne
her power. Were it
not a prophanation to
sunder that symmetrie
of Vertue and Beautie,
(pieces, of which you
are the whole, and which
worthily beget wonder
and love▪ I might aspire
to levell prayses to
some few particulars:
but since such a disunion
cannot bee made

by a weake pen without
cracking or disordering
th
•
 goodliest
frame of Nature; Madam
you must give
mee leave onely to admire
you in great, as
the great Subject of
all admiration. If in
writing You, I fall short
of sense; it is Love:
if I overreach it; it is
Wonder: so is sense and
language oppress'd▪ or
heightned by the subject
that admits no meane.
Madam, if this Pamphlet
of You rise in the

opinion of the World, it
is You; if it fall, it is
I; I, that have batter'd
my braines against as
great a miracle as the
Philosophers stone. If
you please to receive it
with a favour answerable
to the ambition it is
offered, I shall account it
the greatest honour that
can bee done to him, in
whose esteem (Madam)
You are the first and last
of these Stories; the unparallel'd
Lady DOROTHY
SYDNEY, the incō
parable
ARETAPHILA.
