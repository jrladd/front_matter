Right Honourable and Right Worſhipfull,


YOur conſtant Favours which I alwayes find,
Do me in all my beſt endeavours bind,
Upon all fair occaſions, to expreſſe
My due and deeply bounden thankfullneſſe,


Aswell for paſt as preſent ſweet-Supplies,
Which from your bleſſed-Houſe of Charities
Poore Orphant-cheering-brests, my-Self have found,
With Thouſands-more, whom (elſe) diſtreſſe had drown'd
In over flowing floods of Poverty,

Our Parents poor being forc't from us to fly,
And leave us hopeleſse Imps, in helpleſse age
To all Earths woes, fully, on us to rage.
Theſe, theſe (I ſay) indiſſoluble Tyes

Of ancient and of modern Courteſies,
Which to Heavens glory, here, memorate,
Doe me (bleſt Patrons) ſtirre and ſtimulate,
To dedicate and conſecrate to You
What ere I am or can, as Tribute, due
To your full-Sea, from my ſmall-Rivolet,

Thus to repay ſome part of my great debt:
And ſince I owe more then I know to pay,
My humble-All reſts to my dying-day

Your Honours and Worſhips
Sincerely to be commanded,
JOHN VICARS.
