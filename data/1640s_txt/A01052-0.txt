To my Deſervingly-honoured, IOHN WYRLEY Eſquire, and to the vertuous and right worthy Gentle-woman, Mrs MARY WYRLEY his wife, This ſervice.

THE inequalitie of retribution turnes to a pitty, when there is not ability ſufficient for acknowledgement. Your equall reſpects may yet admit the readineſſe of Endevour, though the very hazard in it, betray my Defect. I have enjoyed freely acquaintance, with the ſweetneſſe of your diſpoſitions; and can juſtly account, from the Nobleneſſe of them, an evident diſtinction betwixt Friendſhip and Friends. The latter (according to the practice of complement) are uſually met with; and often without Search: The other, many have ſearcht for, I have found. For which, though I partake a benefite of the fortune;

yet to you (moſt equall Paire) muſt remain the Honour of that Bounty. In preſenting this Iſſue of ſome leſſe ſerious houres to your tuition, I appeale from the ſeveritic of cenſure, to the mercy of your Iudgements: and ſhall rate It at a higher value, than when It was mine own, if you onely allow It the favour of Adoption. Thus, as your happines in the fruition of each others love, proceeds to a conſtancie: ſo the truth of mine, ſhal appeare leſſe un-ſhaken, as you ſhall pleaſe to continue in your good opinions.

IOHN FORD.
