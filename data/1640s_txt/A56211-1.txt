TO HIS
EVER-HONOVRED, NOBLE,
KINDE FRIENDS,
THE
Right Honourable Lord Ferdinando Fairfax, the
Right Worshipfull, Sir William Waller, and Sir William
Bruerton, Knights, Commanders in Chiefe, of
the Parliaments Forces, in severall Counties.


Deservedly Renowned Worthies,


YOVR Incomparable Valour, Zeale, Activity,
Industry for the preservation of Your Dearest
Country, Religion, Lawes, Liberties,
and the very being of Parliaments, all now
endangered by an unnaturall generation of
Popish and Malignant Vipers, lately risen up
in Armes against them in diverse parts of this
Realme; and those many miraculous Victories
with which God hath beene lately pleased to Crowne your cordiall
endeavours, to promote his glory and the Publicke safety, as
they have justly demerited some gratefull generall Acknowledgements
from the whole Representative Body of the State; so they
may in some sort challenge a private gratulatory Retribution from
Me, who have formerly had the happinesse to participate in your Christian

Affections, and now reape much Consolation by your Heroick
Actions.

Having therefore seasonably finished this Third part, Of the Soveraigne
Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms; copiously Vindicating,
the Lawfulnesse, Iustnesse of the Parliaments present
Necessary Defensive Warre (in which you have had the Honour to
be imployed, not onely as Chiefe, but which is more, as most successefull
Commanders, in your severall Countries,) in point both of Law
and Conscience; and fully wiping off those blacke Aspersions, of
TREASON and REBELLION, which the opposite party
(really guilty of these crimes against both King and Kingdome,
as I havePart 1. Edit. 2 p. 108, to 112.
elsewhere manifested, and here lightly touched) have out
of Malice, Ignorance, or both conjoyned, most injuriously cast upon your
Loyall, honourable proceedings, which rejoyce the soules of all true
Philopa

ers, who cordially affect their Country or Religion; I could
not, without much ingratitude, yea injustice, have published it to the
world, but under the Patronage of your ever-honored res
•
lendent names,
who have so valorously, so successefully pleaded this Cause already in
the Field, that it needs the lesse assistance from the Presse.

My many inevitable interruptions and straites of time in its contexture,
which may happily detract something from its perfection;
shall I hope, derogate nothing from your Honourable, Friendly acceptation;
whom I have thus conjoyned in the Dedication; because the
Parliament hath united you in their present Warlike employments,
and God himselfe joyntly honoured you with successe, even to admiration
among the Good, indignation amidst Malignants, envy with
the Malicious, and, I trust, to an active sedulous em

lation in all your
Fellow Commanders, imployed in other Quarters in the selfesame
Cause.
Your present busie publike, and mine owne private Imployments,
prohibite me to expatiate; Wherefore earnestly beseeching the Glorious

Lord of Hosts to be ever mightily present with your severall Noble
Persons, Forces, and to make you alwayes eminently, active, Valorous,
Victorious, as hitherto he hath done, till Peace and Truth,
Tranquillity and Piety, by your severall triumphant Proceedings, shall
once more lovingly embrace and kisse each other in our divided
unreformed, sinfull Kingdome; And till the effect of these just warres
You manage, shall be quietnesse and assurance to us and our Posterities
after us for ever; I humbly recommend your Persons, Proceedings
to his protection who can secure you in and from all dangers of
warre, and rest,

Your Honours, Worships
most affectionate Friend
and Servant,
WILLIAM PRYNNE.
