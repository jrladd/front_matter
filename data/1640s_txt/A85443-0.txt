TO THE
HONORABLE HOVSE
OF
COMMONS,
Aſſembled in
PARLIAMENT.

YOur Command giving me the opportunity,
I took the boldneſſe to urge and encourage
you to Church-Reformation,
(which is the maine ſcope of this Sermon)
a ſubject which otherwiſe (and in all
other Auditories) I have beene ſilent in, and am no
whit ſorry for it: For I account it the moſt fit and happy
ſeaſon to utter things of this nature unto Authority
it ſelfe, (although the people likewiſe are to know their
duty.) My comfort is, that what I have ſpoken herein,
I have (for the generall) (and I have ſpoken but generalls)
long beleeved, and have therefore ſpoken.

You were pleaſed ſo far to owne me, as to betruſt me

with this Service, to be Gods mouth in publique
unto you; and alſo this Sermon of mine, as to command
the publiſhing of it. Wherefore as in propriety
it is now become yours, more then mine, or all the
worlds: So let it be in the uſe of it. If it ſhall adde
the leaſt ſtrengthening to your reſolutions, to keepe
this purpoſe for ever in the thoughts of your
hearts, I have what I aimed at. Goe on, (worthy Fathers,
and Elders of this people) and proſper in, yea
by this work; without which, nothing that you doe
will proſper.—But the reſt I ſhall ſpeak to God
for you. Let me be known to you by no other thing then
this, To be one, whoſe greateſt deſires, and conſtant
prayers are, and have been, and utmoſt endeavours (in
my ſpheare) ſhall be for the making up the diviſions
of the Church in theſe diſtracted times with love of
Truth and Peace: And therein (to uſe Davids
words) am

Wholly at your commandment,
Tho: Goodwin.
