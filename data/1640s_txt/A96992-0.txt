The Epiſtle Dedicatorie▪

O Pierce my heart with fervent love of thee!God.

The beauty of thy face, Lord, let me ſee!
Riſe from thy cloudy Eaſtern cloyſters black,
Spread forth thy glorious beames and be not ſlack,
To thawe my Icie heart, which ſinne hath froſen,
Aſſure my conſcience, Lord, I am thy choſen.
And thou my Sovereigne,The King.
Charles, all Europs ſplendor,
Thine enemies terrour and true Faith's Defend
•
r,
Thy love preſerv'd my life, not heatheniſh fate,
In thy Majeſtick face, true Princely ſtate:
When malice plotted miſchief everie houre,
Thy clemency prevented all their power:
That God which grac'd thee with a Royall Crowne,
Crown thee with grace, thy Honours with renown.
* All you poore ſoules whoſe eares have been abuſed,People.

With ſcandalous reports and eyes traduced
With charmes of turbulent ſpirits; new take and view,
This Declaration honeſt, plain, and true.


Per Henry Walker Cantab.
