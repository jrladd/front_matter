To the Chriſtian Reader.

CHriſtian Reader,

I beſeech thee, as thou tendereſt thy ſalvation, that thou wouldeſt throughly examine the following Diſputation, in the fear of God, conſidering how much his glory is concerned therein; and at any hand forbear to condemn my opinion as erroneous, till thou art able to bring pertinent and ſolid Anſwers to all my Arguments; for thou muſt know, that though I have conteſted with ſundry learned men, yet hath none hitherto produced a ſatisfactory Anſwer to ſo much as one Argument.
Farewel.
J. B.
