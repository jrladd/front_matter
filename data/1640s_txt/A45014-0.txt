To the Right HONOVRABLE The LORDS and COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT, The humble Petition of the Captaines, Officers and Souldiers of the Trayned Bands and Voluntiers, of the County of Buckingham, Aſſembled at Alisbury, Iune 17. 1642.

Humbly ſheweth,


THat they give you thanks from the depth of their hearts, for the great and many benefits they have already reaped from your no leſſe chargeable, then Indefatigable paines, and in particular for your neceſſary Ordinance of the Militia, on which, as we conceive (under God) our ſafety doth depend, unto which we moſt cheerefully, ſudmit, as is manifeſt by this dayes appearance, not onely of the Trained Bands, but of well neere a thouſand Voluntiers, that make all demonſtration of Obedience, as well to this, as all other Commands that ſhall come from your Honourable Houſes, in oppoſition to the Popiſh

malignant Party at home, or any other power from abroad, notwithſtanding the many viſible diſcouragements from ill affected perſons that make it their buſineſſe to blemiſh the validity of your Authority, as alſo by the Lord Lieutenant's abſence contrary to the truſt repoſed in him.
Therefore we humbly implore the continuance of your care for our Safeties, and to appoint ſuch a Lord Lieutenant, in whom we may confide, as ſurely you may in us, who are reſolved to lay our lives and fortunes at your feet, in defence of the King and Parliament.
And we ſhall pray &c.
