TO
THE TRVE LOVER
OF ALL
GOOD LEARNING.
The truly Honorable, Sir
Anthony Vincent Knight
and Baronet, &c.

SIR,


THe workes of Royall Authors are
onely fit to bee lodged in noble
hands, to whom then more juſtly
could I devote this ſervice then
unto YOU to whom all learning owes for a
Patron, and the world for an Example.
This is that which hath invited me to
this Dedication, beſides an ambition which

a long time I have nouriſhed that poynteth at
no other happines then to ſtudy out ſome
way to make my ſelfe knowne unto YOU,
and if my devotion to your ſervice can
winne on your goodneſſe to pardon my preſumption
the glorious endowments of this
moſt illuſtrious Lady (who in her time was
one of the greateſt Princeſſes of Europe) ſhall
winne on your Iudgemeut to entertaine this
everlaſting Iſſue and MEMORIALL of
her, in which there is no other errour to be
found but that it is preſented to the world
and you by this rude hand

Sir,
of your moſt
humble
and moſt
devoted ſervant,
Robert Codrington.
