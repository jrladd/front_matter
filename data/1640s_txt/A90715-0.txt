To the READER.

BEloved, It may ſeem ſtrange (to many) that I am intermedling
with Controverſies amongſt the Learned
in Divinity. And therefore it▪ is likely that ſome will
ſay of me, as it was ſomtime ſaid of one, Thou art but
a ſtripling, but they are men of War from their youth▪ and therefore
not to be encountred with by thee. And they will think it
more ſafer for me to be employed about meaner matters, of a lower
Nature, rather than to encounter with gyants. And (perhaps)
give me a nipping check, like that of Eliab to David; viz. Where
are thoſe few ſheep left in the Wilderneſs? It is thy pride that moved
thee to come and ſee the battel. But my anſwer is as that which
then was made, What have I now done? Is there not a cauſe? &c.
There were Iſraelites on the one ſide that ſtood for the glory of
God▪ and the lawful liberty of his children; and there were Philiſtines
on the other ſide, that did defie Chriſt and his redeemed Ones,
and they had one great Goliah on whom they did caſt their confidence,
and he did approach towards the Iſraelites with reproach and
defiance, and yet thoſe Iſraelites remained in a kind of aſtoniſhment.
Our condition is ſomwhat like theirs (if well examined.) And
although I am not furniſhed with ſuch complete Armour as ſome other
(ſpiritual) Warriours are, yet if the ſtone of Iſrael be with me,
I ſhall have good ſucceſs; You know, a jaw-bone was but a ſtrange
peice of Armour, yet a thouſand Philiſtins could not ſtand againſt
it, for God was with it: And his riddle did occaſion the quarrel between
them; for they brake the Covenant of Garments and Sheets,
as ſome have done in a Covenant with me here.
I will not compare my ſelf with any of thoſe Warriours: yet
give me leave to put forth a Riddle;
By weakneſs comes ſtrength▪
Yet ſtrength beareth down weakneſs.


Canterbury,
May, 1648.

Yours, for Truth,
GEORGE PALMER.
