TO THE
RIGHT HONOVRABLE
the LORDS now Aſſembled in
PARLIAMENT at Weſtminſter.

MY LORDS;



I
 Have obſerved, that long Epiſtles
are as little pleaſing as
long Sermons; and therefore
ſhall not be troubleſome by a
tedious Dedication: Onely your Lordſhips
may pleaſe to take notice, that this
Sermon, which is now Printed in obedience
to your Order, before it goes forth to publike
view, comes firſt to be Preſented to
your Honours. It is ſufficient aſſurance
of acceptance and countenance, that your

Lordſhips pleaſure is to have it publiſhed.
If now this little ſparke, or rather almoſt
dead coale; ſhall give the leaſt
light or heat to any heart, that ſhall vouchſafe
to reade it; and hereby any acceſsion
may be made, to the praiſe, or to the fear
of This glorious and fearfull Name,
Deut. 28. 58.
THE LORD OƲR GOD: It is
that which is deſired, and as much as can
be expected by,

MY LORDS,
Your Honours moſt unworthy
Servant in the work of the Miniſtery,
JOHN WARD.
