TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES, PRINCE OF GREAT BRITAIN.

Moſt excellent Sir,


DRawing my breath every day more happily by the favour I received from Your Royall Father, if my Pen ſhould forget You, it had more Inke then either allegiance, or loyalty, or duty: The Eyes that I here preſent

Your. Highneſſe, I confeſſe durſt not looke his Majeſtie in the Face; He hath ſo much of Caeſar about Him as ſtrikes me into a non poſſum ferre fulmen: but Your Selfe, being yet a divine ſpark and ray from Him, and not aſcended Your Meridian of Soveraigntie, is not become ſo awfull, nor ſo inacceſsible. We may ſee that Sun in his Riſing, whoſe Beames may at his Noone chide our weake eyes for the attempt: This Sir I ſpeake of You, who is but now in Your Eaſt, having Your Noone-point before You, and may You drive

on happily to Your glory both in Your Heaven and Kingdome below, and the Kingdome of Heaven above.
And be pleaſed, Gratious Sir, to let theſe Eyes here light but a beame of Yours to the holy Scripture, and to ayre but Your Boſome at theſe Flames, and to ſuffer theſe Leafes, thus ſeeded with divine thoughts, to be a robe of holy Ermins to Your Soule: I lay my ſelfe and papers at Your Royall feet, and am

A Beadeſman for Your Highneſſe
J. Saltmarſhe.
