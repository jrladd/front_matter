TO THE HIGH, AND MIGHTY, AND OVR ROYALL KING CHARLES;
By the Grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, &c. The Lord grant, to his Honours increase, to his dayes length, and to his Royall Person and posterity (both here and hereafter) Eternall Glory. Amen.


Most Royall Soveraigne,


I Doe not presume to sore so high; in Respect of the worth of my labours above others; for had they beene penned by a farre more exquisite Author, yet might a much inferior patronage (notwithstanding) have beene a worthy favour: I am I doe confesse altogether unworthy

under such a patronage to purchase favour to a popular eye: how then shall I crave favour of your Sacred Majestie to deeme a gracious eye upon me. To prostrate these before your Highnesse, as a present, they proceede from too inferior an Author; Or as counsells, it were too great presumption. Yet your gratious, meeke, and pious Soveraignty emboldeneth me to devote the fruit of my meane labours to your Princely eys, because (though weake, yet) faithfull, which though it cannot bee good enough to deserve that gratious countenance of my Royall Soveraigne, yet this I can protest, that my heart, my tongue, my hand and penne, shall be alwaies, upon all opportunities (next under God) devoted to my Royall King, and Gracious Soveraigne.

And be glad as I am able (though unworthie) to extoll Your Highnesse worthy praise.
H. Walker.
