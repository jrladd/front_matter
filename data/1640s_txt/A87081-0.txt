To the honorable the Committee for Contribution of monies to the diſtreſſed Paoteſtants of Ireland.
RIght Honorable, Neceſſity hath as many tongues and pennes as Briarius hands, Argus eyes, or ſin advocates, and thoſe dictators of our miſeries, never had a juſter cauſe than now to ſupplicate for their own ſilence, and by a divine proportion, Charity hath not only large bowels but many and open eares, ſo that the ſpeakers and auditors have an equality in number. No Nation hath had larger taſtes of the firſt, than the Engliſh in Ireland, nor any Nation ever produced a larger crop of the laſt (to furniſh the firſt) than England): The traine oyle of our calamities hath made the lamps of their Charities to ſhine the world over, whilſt the oyle from their cruſes and meale from their barrels hath not failed to furniſh, us & as they are to be honored for this crop, we are alſo to honor you for the carefull ſtoring and diſtributing thereof. Me thinks I find no yeare of Jehoaſh ſo famous as that in the 2 of Kings, 4, 5. and 15. v. in which was the care to repair that holy fabrick dedicated to God, and in that work nothing more glorious than the performance of that truſt by them that were to effect this repaire; for it ſeems the generall contribution was not ſo rich or great, as the honeſty of thoſe entruſted. The calamitous Proteſtants are the temples of the holy Ghoſt, which like that ruined ſtructure, want repair, that a ſupply of the former cares and zeale were requiſite, & as thouſands cannot but praiſe God for the indefatigable pains and labours in your pious diſtributions, yet divers that have ſtaid longeſt and ventured, ſuffered, and effected moſt, have not had ſo much as a taſt of this hony, with Jonathan on the tip of their rod to cheere their feeble and fainting ſoules ſpent in the purſuit, and ſlaughter of thoſe Iriſh Philiſtims, who thirſt after ſome of the hony combe of Charity, pine for It, and moſt famiſh without it. I repine at no mans ſucceſſe, but it appeares to mee that thoſe wyich brought their cloaths and meanes away before the rebellion, had warm'd a houſe, ſhould find Cloaths, meanes and warm'th

here, when as ſuch as ſtaied to ſpend and venture their lives, and blou ſhould find neither, ſo that I muſt conclude our deſires to do ſervice there, detain'd us ſo, that now our deſires cannot be ſerv'd. I am not ignorant what juſt cauſe of ſuſpence may be given your honours from thoſe that uſurped the name of ruined Proteſtants, and of ſome which I could produce that have gone by their own virgin Sirnames, their firſt husbands, and their husbands by two names, which cheating of the publick charity, might juſtly incenſe your honours to explode the truly deplorable Petitioners which are as worthy of relief, as the others of puniſhment, were it the only laboure of ſome knowne man, to examine the petitions, and ſubſcriptions, certificates, and perſons, this abuſe might be reformed, if not cured; but I hope ſome particulars will nor ecclipſe, thoug it a darken a while a publike good, and with Charity, which warmed theſe impoſtures will heate, ſuch as truly want her beames: the Sun alters not his courſe, becauſe the earth is ful of lay-ſtals. No Act of the Apoſtles wins more upon me, than their publike charity transferred into Judea to the diſtreſſed brethren, by the hands of Saul, and Barnabas in thoſe dayes of emptineſſe, Acts 11.29.30. The ſame your honours are to us the ſons of conſolation, in which act of theirs, thete was not only a good purpoſe, but a proſecution. The care of Joſeph in proviping is not to be preferred before that of his diſtributing, by which he not only ſuſtained the ſubject, but enrich the King, you have the ſame power for what relief you offered to the members, Crowns the head (Chriſt Jeſus) who ſignes acquaintances to charitable works with his own hand (inſomuch as you have done it unto one of theſe little ones, you have done it unto me.)
I more like the peace and charity of Conſtantine the firſt Chriſtian Emperour procured to the poore Chriſtians, then his erecting or repairing their Churches, and I more applaud that Centurion, for loving the Jewiſh nation, then for building them a Sinagogue, becauſe the templls made with hands (which I honur as publick places appointed for Gods worſhip, may become dennes of thieves, cages of uncleanneſſe, or as amongſt the Iriſh (Jewes in ſome traditions) publik market places,

or what is more terrible as I have known the two moſt famous Cathedralls in Dublin made a meeting place for uncleanneſſe, though all this while that holy pile is innocent, though abuſed, or which is yet worſe, may become Popiſh Sanctuaries, refuges for the moſt impious or laſtly be made the ſtorehouſes, or ſupporters to ſuch profane, and Idolatrous images, as the purer Temples of the Holy Ghoſt (which Temples we are) ſhall not onely abhorre, but demoliſh, as Moſes the Calfe.
The Apoſtles were not ſtiled oratores, and vinatores, for their heavenly tilling, or pruning the Church, but for ſowing their bread upon the waters, and relieving the living vines, the diſtreſſed Saints, O heavenly Charity the laſt companion of the ſoul, thou immortall vertue, how many naked haſt thou to cloath, hurt to heale, hungry to feed, impriſoned to viſit, captived to ranſome, fatherleſſe to protect, harbourleſſe to lodge, widowes to defend, many of which thy lengthened arm hath reached, even as farre as Argier, Germany, and that diſconſolate neighbour of thine, the moſt diſconſolate of all Ilands groning grieving, pernning Ireland, who according to her ancient cuſtome, hath ſent thee, knowing yet O Englands charity, thy breaſts full of milk, and bones of marrow,) thouſands of her children to ſofter, for there ſhe feares like Tekoahs widow, The beſtiall family is riſen upto deſtroy the heire, and quench his ſparckle which is left, and ſhall not leave to her husband either name, or poſterity upon the earth, your honours being the pious agents to the Engliſh charity, may comfort this juſt neceſſarie, and conſiderable complaint, ſaying with that heavenly hymniſt, go to thine houſe, and I will give a charge for thee, amongſt the reſt of the unrelieved, I come like Eſau from the Iriſh woods to your honours, to whom I ſpeak, as hero Iſaac, in the ſame words and bitterneſſe, haſt thou but one bleſſing my Father, bleſſe me, even me alſo my Father, and the God of compaſſion bleſſe your Honours, that you as a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, may help to lead us that lately came from that land, now the houſe of bondage, in our poore and wearie pilgrimage, to the land of promiſe, where God ſhall return your ſheaves with a harveſt theſe are the prayers of your devoted ſerv
