For the Right Honourable,
LORDS the Peeres, and Gentlemen
of the Honourable Houſe of
COMMONS.

THe Author, as to the firſt
part of his Animadverſions
touching the late motions
of the State, in the
viſible purſuance of Arbytrary
power, preſents
them not as newes to a
Court of Parliament, the evidence whereof being
obvious to all the world, onely hee ranckes
them here in a new fyle, for ſatisfaction of the
incredulous Malignant, not capable to owane
his owne friends, neither will be ſenſible what
your indefatigable labours have beene, or take
notice of the pains you have taken, during theſe

foure yeares, for Preſervation of the common
freedome and liberties of the Kingdome.
As to the ſecond part, which is a narrative,
touching the Warre under the conduct of major
Generall Laughorns, it is offered to all of diſcerning
Iudgements, how mirakculouſly Gods ſpeciall
providence hath evidently appeared as well
in that particular of the County of Pembrook as in
the Generall proſperity of the Kingdoms armes.
The concluſive part, is both humbly monotory
and petitionary, that, that poore deſſolated
County, with the parts adiacent may be timely
taken into your compaſsionate conſideration,
and ſuch a ſpeedy courſe taken therein as may
beſt ſuit with your preſent great and urgent affairs:The inveterate fewds and diſſentions of this County, hath beene a great hindrance to the publike ſervice, and if not timely compoſd, may be of a more dangerous conſequence
The diſtreſſed condition whereof (through
Gerrards cruelties) is truly laid open unto you; as
alſo the way of this Counties repaire (in ſome
competent meaſure) humbly preſented in a few
Propoſitions, which may both rectifie the many
grievances and diſſentions of this County, together,
with the diſorder of the Souldier; without
other charging the State, or farther
troubling, your important Conſultations,
otherwiſe, then in your timely deſignation of
ſome honeſt and able Gentlemen, (as your Commiſſioners,

to examine all grievances, eſpecially
in the behalfe of ſuch, as have ſuffered in the loſſe
of their whole eſtates in the publike ſervice, and
are at preſent reduced to extreame want and penury,
the care whereof in all humbleneſſe is deſired
and left to your pious providence, leaſt the
conſtant party there ſhould bee utterly diſheartned,
and at ſuch time, as there may be preſent uſe
of their farther ſervice, ſince probable it is, that
the Iriſh Rebels (on their late victory) may
thruſt over ſuch Forces into that County and Milford
-Haven, as may turn the Skales of your Victories
here (if not timely prevented, by garding
thoſe Coaſts with a ſtrong Fleete,) both the
Welch Nation, and Engliſh Malignants in the
generall (howſoever now maſtered) retaining
ſtill their wonted hearts, may in all likely-hood
on all occaſions joyne with the ſtrongeſt.
And thus in all humilitie hath the Author taken
the boldneſſe to preſent unto your wiſdoms
the whole ſcope of his poore indeavours, and
humbly craves farther leave to concludewith the
Oracles of two great Princes, wiſhing, that they
may profit ſuch, as they moſt concerne.
The ſtrength of a King is the preſervation of
the State,King James his Speech in Parliament, 1609. the foundation thereof, is the people,

and woe unto them, which devides the weale of a
King from that of the Kingdome.
How guilty the Delinquent and malignant
party have beene in the fomentation of the preſent
deviſions, the appeale is made to their owne
Conſciences, which have moſt unnaturally invaded
the people in their repreſentative, and have
indeavoured to deprive both King and Kingdome
of their great Councell.

Aequius eſt me tot,

〈…〉

 & talium amicorum conſilium,
quam tot & tales, meam unius voluntatem ſequi.

How averſe His Majeſties great heart hath
beene in following the veſtigia of this famous
Emperor and how fatall to himſelfe, let 3. ruined
Kingdomes be the Arbiters, and his owne conſcience
the faithfull umpier.

Your moſt conſtant and faithfull
Servant,
Gil: Batt:
