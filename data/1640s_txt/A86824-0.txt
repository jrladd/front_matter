To his truly noble, and worthily honoured friend THOMAS STANLEY Eſquire.


My dearest friend,


SInce it is the hard fortune of theſe glow-worms to ſee day, I wiſh they might have paſſed your examination; for I know you to be a ſevere Critick in Poetry, aſwell as in Philology, and the Sciences: But ſince others importunities, and mine own preſſing occaſions, have denied it, I must preſent them loaden with their own blemiſhes, that being fitter Objects of Pardon, they may draw in pardoning, more demonſtrations of your Candor, and adde to my Engagements, could they receive Augmentation. I will not commit a Rape upon your modeſty by any praiſes, though Truth her ſelf might be your Panegyriſt, and yet continue naked; give me onely leave to tell you from mine own experience, that Love is more then a mere

Sympathy: for admiration did firſt attract my thoughts to you, and after fix them; though it were onely your innate ſweetneſſe that received them with an undeſerved entertainment. Sir What I was firſt endebted to you at Durham I endeavour to acquit in part here at Cambridge: for the Totall, though it be rather above my ability, then deſires, yet ſhould I hate the thought of a Generall diſcharge, let me onely beg of you that theſe Cherryſtones may draw from you your own Pearls, which cannot but break themſelves a day through that darkneſſe to which you now confine them. Let us once ſee Fancy triumph in the ſpoyls of the richeſt Learning, there will many (no doubt) preſſe to follow the Chariot, yet ſhall none be more forward then

Sir,
Your moſt affectionately devoted ſervant J. HALL

St. JOHNS

Jan. 6. 1646.
