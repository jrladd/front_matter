To the worthy Gentleman
Mr. George Butler profeſſor of the
Arts Liberall, And true Patron to
Neglected Poeſie, All Health and
Happineſſe.

Worthy Sir,


I May be thought bold, if not impudent,
(upon ſo little acquaintance)
to make this ſawcy treſpaſſe upon
your patience; But fame, whoſe office,
(like the Nomenclators at Rome) is to
to take notice and proclaime the Name and
vertues of every Noble Perſonage, has given
you out for ſo Ingenuous a profeſſor of the
Arts, & ſo bountiful a patron of poor ſchollars
it has imboldned me, to preſent my Hive of
Bees to your favourable protection; and when
I remember how Lewis the eleventh (of that
Name) King of France tooke notice, & bountifully
rewarded a decay'd Gardiner, who preſēted
him with a bunch of Carrets, I doubt not
of their kinde and generous entertainment;
upon which aſſurance I reſt ever.

Yours in all ſervice devote.
JOHN DAY.
