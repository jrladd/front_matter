To
The Towne-Reader.

TO tell thee true, I am
both sorrie and ashamed,
to have spent so
many idle houres with
thee; and therefore to
avoyd the expence of more, have retired
me from the Towne. This then
to thee, is in part of acknowledgement
of it, as of purpose to amend;
and as this shall find acceptance, so
expect at convenient leisure to heare
from me againe. For my disposition

(if thou knowest it not) thou mayest,
from this Ode of mine.

(1)
Free as I was borne I'll live,
So should everie wise man do:
Only fools they are, that give
Their freedoms to I know not who.


(2)
If my weaknesse cannot save it,
But 'tmust go; what e're it cost:
Some more strong than I shall have it,
Can make good what I have lost.


(3)
Still some excellencie should be
More i'th' Master, than the Slave,
Which in others till I see,
None my libertie shall have.


(4)
Nor is't excellencie enough,
Time nor Chance can mar or make;
But 'tmust be more lasting stuffe,
Shall from me my freedome take.



(5)
Wherefore beautie never shall
On my libertie intrude:
And proud greatnesse least of all,
Cause 'tis proud, once to conclude.


(6)
Those to whom I'll give away,
That which none too deare can buy,
Shall be made of better clay,
And have better souls than I.

For the Treatise it selfe, by reason
there are but too many of that depraved
pallate, to whom all seems insipid
and disgustfull, that is, seasoned
with any taste of pietie, to occur to
such infirme appetites, I have served
up their meat in little pieces, thus cut
up unto their hands, which in greater
perhaps they would not like so well.
To make it a more spreading work, if
I would, I could have beat it thinner,

(the matter was plyable enough unto
the hammer) but I like not works of
that raritie, defined by the Philosopher,
Sub magna quantitate substantia
parva. And hold in books as
in coyne, those of most value in least
quantitie the best. That I am so frequent
in Latin citation, those I am
sure who are verst in the language,
will easily pardon it; the rest, I hope,
will not be difficile, when they shall
find in the reading, the sense compleat
without it. If any demand, why then
I inserted it, I answer, works of this
fabrick, consolidate and built upon
authority of holy Writ, without
frequent Texts of it, for foundation
and cement, are worthily esteemed,
but weake and loose-written things.
Now that I chose the Latin to any

other vulgar; I presumed, as a builder,
they would give me leave to provide
my materials, when I supposed
them at best hand to be got. But I
detaine thee too long in the porch, unlesse
with Malchus thou thinkest
much to have an eare in the passion:
Enter the work, and if thou receivest
but as much profit in reading, as I entended
thee in writing, we shall both
be happy in it. Farewell:

R. F.
