TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE the Lord Viscount Say and Seale, &c. Peace.


NOBLE SIR,


LEarned Casaubon assures me that when the Greek 
Vide Annotat. Casaub. in G. Nys. Epist. ad Amb. & Bas.
Pacem ecclesia, pacem Christi amissā quaerere, & turbatā componere, & repertam tenere curavimus Sed hujus ipsius fieri nos vel participes vel autores, nec tēporis nostri peccata me ruerunt—nec Antichristi ministri sunt passi, qui Pace sua, id est, Impietatis sua unitato se jactant, agentes se non ut Christi Episcopos, sed Antichristi Sacerdotes. Hilarius contra Auxentium.
 Fathers wrote to a wicked man they were wont to salute him with that Apostolicall benediction, Grace be unto you: but when they wrote to a religious man they used the ordinary Hebraisme, Peace be unto you, because Peace doth suppose Grace, and doth comprehend all outward blessings. I am sure your very enemies gave you this testimony at Oxford, that you were a man of Peace, but as it followes in the Psalme, when you spake for peace they were for warre. Psalme 120. 7. All that your Honour desired was, that (as it became gowned men) they would take up their bookes, and lay down their armes; that they would not protect Delinquents any longer, but yeeld them up to a legall tryall. You desired that nothing might be tumultuously attempted, but all things orderly reformed. You engaged your Honour to them that what Plate you found in places fit for Plate, the Treasury or the Buttery should remaine untouched, and most Societies engaged themselves by a solemne promise, that they would never give their consent that their Plate should be put to any other use then what was sutable and according to their oath, and the intention of the

Donours, their successors having in all these respects as great an interest in the Plate as themselves; Nay they generally confessed that they had no more power to aliene their Plate then their Lands. In confidence of their promise you told them you did leave their Plate in their owne custody, which otherwise you would have secured, and in confidence of your Honours promise they brought forth their Plate, and made publique use of it, even whilest the souldiers were in towne▪ Your Lordship found the University (as the Reverend Doctours had left it) groaning under a kinde of Anarchy; for it was thought fit by the Round-house, that the University should be dissolved, and every man left to doe what seemed good in his owne eyes. It was suggested by a Doctor well read in Politiques, that if they did not dissolve the University, the Parliament would dissolve it▪ But your Honour made it appear how much you did abhorre an Anarchy, and honour the Vniversity; you assembled those few Governours of private Colledges which were at home, and the Substitutes of all that were absent, you consulted them how the Vniversity might be put into its right posture: You assured them that it was not the intent of the Parliament to change the Government or infringe the Liberties of the Vniversity, & that though the new Statutes were justly complained of, yet you conceived it fit that the Vniversity should for the present be governed by Lawes that were none of the best, rather then left quite without Rule, or government; they all confessed that you behaved your selfe more like a Chauncellour then a souldier, for the Vniversity was not over-awed by a garrison, or over-ruled by a Councell of warre. You did not impose any Taxes upon the University, you did not go about to perswade them that Guns were Mathematicall Instruments, and therefore they might buy guns with that very money which was bequeathed and set apart for Mathematicall Instruments; you did not importune any Scholars to list themselves in your Regiment, nor did you desire that Doctours would turne Commanders, or that any Commanders should be created Doctours, or boyes created Masters, lest there might be an Anarchy even in Convocation by such a Premeditated Confusion; and yet such counsells and practises have been suggested by some, that are none of the meanest Ranke. When I was commanded by speciall warrant to attend your Honour, (deputed by both houses of Parliament

ros. truth in the Vniversity of Oxford, and to reduce the said Vniversity to its ancient order, right Discipline, and to restore it to its former priviledges and liberties) there was notice given of a pestilent book very prejudiciall both to truth and peace, and upon search made, the book was found in the chamber of Mr. Webberly, who had translated this Socinian Master-Peece into English for his own private use, as he pretended; to which vain excuse I replyed that I made no question but he understood the book in Latine, and therefore had he intended it only for his own private use, he might have saved the paines of translating it. Besides the Frontispice of the book under Mr. Webberlies own hand did testify to his face that it was translated into English for the benesit of this Nation. Moreover there was an Epistle to the Reader prefixed before the booke; (I never heard of any man yet that wrote an Epistle to himselfe) and therefore sure he intended to print it. Finally, he submits all to the consideration of these times of Reformation, and the Reformers have thought fit that it should be answered and published. I desired at the first Intimation to decline the service, because it were better to confute Socinianisme in Latine; but I have since considered that

. Mr. Walker, and therefore if this Treatise had been suppressed, their opinions would not be unknown, for they are already divulged.

2. The opinions being published in English without a confutation, it is very requisite that there should be some Refutation of the errours published also, for it is not fit that a Bedlam should go
•
 abroad without a Keeper.

3. If there be but just suspition of a Designe to introduce damnable heresies, it is requisite that the grounds of suspition should be manifested, especially if it be such a pestilent heresy a
•

Socinianisme is (which corrupts the very vitalls of Church and State) it is fit the heresy should be early discovered left both Church and State be ruined by it.

4. The Parliament is much blamed for imprisoning the Translatour without cause: and it is much wondered at that his Chamber should be searched by officers: now the cause of both will appear.

The Translatour and his work were so famous that there was notice given of his good service intended to this Nation, upon notice given there was a search made, now upon search made the book being found, and the Translatour apprehended, the Parliament is rather guilty of his release then of his Imprisonment.

5. The Translatour cannot complain of the publishing of it, because (as hath been shewn) he himself intended to publish it, he submits all to these times of Reformation, and so doe I, let the Reformers judge. This book belongs to your Honour, because it is but a Prodromus or Fore-runner to make way for a full answer to Master Webberlies Translation, and therefore I present it to you, not only because Master Webberlies book was seised on by your Lordships warrant; but because I know your Honour hath ever patronized the true Protestant Religion, for Protestants doe not place Religion in shadowes and ceremonies; and because you justly abhorre all superstitious rites, whether old or new, all judicious men will esteem you the stricter Protestant. That you may testify your dislike of Schisme as well as Heresy, you have discovered and refuted the uncharitable and bitter errour of the Brownists. You have studied Nazianzens law of Martyrdome, neither to seek nor fear danger; the first would be rashnesse, and the second cowardlinesse.

 King; It is your Iudgement that the Kingdome cannot be preserved without an union between the three Estates by which the kingdome is governed, and if you might have been heard you would have petitioned, and sollicited for an happy union between King and Parliament, only you conceive that an union between a Court of Justice and capitall Delinquents, is intolerable, and an happy union between Protestants and Papists altogether impossible: We cannot forget how many leagues the Papists broke in 6. yeares space; I reckon from 1572. to 1588. Wise Homer and witty Aristophanes were both in good earnest when they said that no man that had either wealth or Innocence could delight in Civill Warre, and Aristophanes shewed himselfe as good a Statesman as a Poet in his sweet lines of Peace, where he advises all men to beware how they enter into a league of Peace with men that are unpeaceable; and sure Delinquents and Papists are none of the trustiest or meekest men; What (saith he) shall Gulls confide in Foxes?

The Papists will certainly count us Protestants Gulls indeed (well we may be as innocent as doves, but we are as simple as Gulls) if we confide in Jesuited Foxes; let the woolfe and the sheep be first married, and see how they agree: let us try whether we can make a crabbe goe streight forward, or make a Hedge-hog smooth.

If we say to the Pope as the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us and we will serve thee, the Pope will answer like Nahash the Ammonite, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it as a reproach upon all England, all Israel, all the Reformed Churches, 1 Sam. 11. 1, 2. If wee have lost our eyes already, let us be avenged on the Philistines; the Lord strengthen us, as Sampson said, that we may overthrow the pillars upon which Rome stands, so shall we be avenged of the Romane Philistines for both our eyes. Judges 16. 28.

But there are other Philistines namely Arminian and Socinian Philistines, by which Church and State are much endangered, and it is the businesse now in hand to lay open their mystery of iniquity

to the publique view. Wee may say to these pestilent Heretiques Tacit. A

 as well as to malignant Statesmen, Ita nati estis ut mala vestra ad Rempub. pertineant; for there are no greater Statesmen in the world then the English Arminians, and Popish Socinians; for such Monsters hath England nourished as are not to be found in all Africa. Herod and Pilate, the Romane and the Racovian Antichrist, are made friends in England, all the Grand-Malignants, Arminians, Papists, and Socinians are of one confederacy, all united under one head the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch or Pope of this British world, alterius orbis Papa as his Brother-Pope hath given him leave to phrase it, because he saw the Arch-Bishop too proud to acknowledge his Supremacy, but forward enough to maintain any other point of Popery, & ready to joyn with him to suppresse all Pure Protestants. If this Design take effect, there may wel be a reconciliation professed & established between Rome and Canterbury, the two Popes may divide the spoile of the Church betweene them if they can but agree at parting. Whether some have not endeavoured to make such a Reconciliation; whether all points of Popery almost have not been greedily embraced in England, and that of the Popes Supremacy only rejected, more out of pride then conscience, let the prudent judge, they have light and evidence enough, and new evidence is dayly produced. The Lord unite the King and Parliament, that Truth and Iustice, Piety and Peace may be established in our dayes: so prayes
