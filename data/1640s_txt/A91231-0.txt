Sir,

IN a Perſon of ſo great Worth as Your ſelf, Vertue
and Goodneſſe muſt needs be not onely diffuſive,
but attractive alſo, and that farre more then in inferiour
men. The boldneſſe therefore aſſumed by me at this
time, in tendring to Your View and Judgement this poor
Eſſay (a weak endeavour of Service to our Countrey
(of which You are ſo true a Lover) will appear (I hope) the
more excuſable: For as thoſe Parts which deſerve Admiration
in You, cannot but command Offices of Hommage
and Gratitude from all good men; ſo thoſe Parts which
render You humble, and gentle, and willing to pardon
other mens Miſtakes, will induce you to interpret well that
Hommage and Gratitude. Sir, I have a very
low conceit of this Conſtitution, as it is now by me faſhioned;
but I have a ſtrong Imagination, That it might prove
Publiquely advantagious, if it were by wiſe and conſidering
men better formed and compleated. I have
therefore purpoſely left a large Margent to my ſhort Diſcourſe,
that a better pen, and direction might change and
ſupply my failing Invention, and take the ſame liberty
to expunge the vanities of my tedious expreſſions. If
there be any thing here tha may but adminiſter the leaſt Occaſion
or hint to your Worth to be a more beneficiall

Patriot, I ſhall think it a happy Service; if not, yet let not
my fruitleſſe wiſhes want your excuſe; and you ſhall oblige
me to be

Sir,
Yours moſt humbly devoted in all Service
and Obſervance to my utmoſt power, H. PARKER.
