VVorthy D. Gouge,

REmembering your antient acquaintance with mee and my Father long since at rest, I presume to father this naked child Without Scholasticke phraises, or Schoole learning to dresse it and garnish it, and so bring it forth to further view, knowing by experience, and also you were well reported of for the opening of Doctrines, seeing you have had a word of knowledge to preach the Doctrine of Repentance from dead workes and faith towards God, and have sweetly taught Christ in his Priestly Office, I beseech you leave some good savour of your name before the close of your eyes concerning Christs Kingly Office; open the Doctrine of the laying on of hands, and rest not in the ceremony which hath been used by the laying on of hands of bloody persecutors, I hope you will be wary of new inventions, to lay on fowle hands againe, leane not to their wisedome that have so long erred, take the advice of the Assemblie of the Saints, and so of the spouse of Christ who washeth her hands in innocencie and compasseth the Alter, let her have her due benevolence and so her right; as she is the Eldership to lay on hands by whom she shall appoint.
Sir, there was much jelosie of you in the time of the Prelates, that you were too full of feares, And now the Lord hath shortned those dayes of persecution; and you have a prise in your hand, being one of the Maisters of the Assemblie, fasten some naile concerning the Doctrine of laying on of hands, which will cleare up holy fellowship and take off that aspertion layd upon your congregations, that they are false; none of Christs, but Antichristian: Though I doe not for

my part say so of them, yet the Doctrine of Baptisme and the Doctrine of laying on of hands is left out of them, notwithstanding the ceremonys have beene of Baptisme and laying on of hands with more then needed which makes some to goe to a second Baptisme. And on other forme, some are seekers out of a Baptisme looking for Elyas as John the Baptist to bring it from heaven, forsaking all fellowship till Christ shall send forth new Apostles to lay on hands; All this is (as I conceive) is for want of the knowledge of those two middle principalls, seeing these things are come to passe in your dayes, before your end; labour in the word and doctrine to cleare up those two principalls, so to our great Doctor I leave you to teach you the misteries of the Kingdome, resting ever to love the Saints.

I Printed a few for my owne use, because I would not loose my thoughts, & for such as shal councell me for the best; for without councell the thoughts perish. If herein I have failed, I hope it will be easily passed by being the first fault upon that subject of laying on hands desiring to provoke to love & goodworkes, so to him that hath loves to bestow upon his beloved, who is the wonderfull councellor. I leave all the worke.
