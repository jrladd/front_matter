To the great hope of growing
noblenesse, my Honourable
friend, Sir Thomas Fisher,
Knight, &c.

Sir,


THe knowledge of your stil
increasing virtue has begot
in all men love, in me
admiration, and desires to
serve it: as cunning Painters
expresse more significant Art in
modell, then extended figures, I have
made election of this little of spring
of my braine, to show you the largest
skill of my many indearments to you;
and as an Ambassadour from the rest
of my faculties, to informe you how
much devotion the whole province

of my Soule payes to your worth and
goodnes. Had I bin endow'd with
such blessings, (noble young man) I
should have presented you a welmand
Hawke, or an excellent Cour
â€¢
er, gifts
(because more agreeable to your Disposition)
more fit to have bin tendred
you: But I am confident you know
that a Booke (as it is my best inheritance)
is the most magnificent sacrifice
my zeale can offer: this Play
therefore accept, best Sir, from him
who is nothing more ambitious then
of the title of 

your true servant and
honourer,
Hen. Glapthorne,
