TO THE WORSHIPFVLL His much esteemd good Friend, Mr. RICHARD PELHAM, Esquire, S. P. Wisheth all happines and prosperity here and hereafter.

WORTHY SIR,



IT may seeme something strange, that so meane a Muse as mine, upon so unworthy a Subject as this, should so rudely dare to shelter it selfe under the protection of your Name, or intrude upon the consure of so solid a judgement as resides in your brest; considering how conversant you daily are with raptures both of a higher straine and better nature, daily proffered to your view and censure: But the perswasion of your courteous acceptation of such wild Olives as these are (as of Plants which inoculated and pruned, in time may produce more mature and delicious fruites unto her fosterers) hath emboldned me to it;

and shall therefore (I hope) be the better excused (though it want much of what I wish it had) because it flyes to you as a Refuge, under whose Hands it hath both security and warrant. Expect no quaint language nor fragrant Flowers of flowing Rhetorick, but such as use to proceed from springing youth, they are the wanton fruits of idle houres, and so happily cannot yeeld that rellish that may be expected from them But yet your ingenuity and generous disposition assures the acceptation being the first fruits of my Muses springing.) And that you cherish them, that they dye not in their Bud, but (by your promptitude) may be preferred from the blast of envy, and the rot of time and oblivion. The perswasion of your liberall acceptation vouchsafed me, not onely ympes my Muses wings for a higher flight in the future, but vowes me to acknowledge my selfe now and ever


Your Worships most obsequiously to be commanded,
SAMUEL PICK.
