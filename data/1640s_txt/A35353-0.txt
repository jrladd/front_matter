TO THE HONORABLE COMMITTEE OF THE HOVSE OF Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, Concerning plundred Miniſters.

Worthy Sirs,


FInding that the Honorable Houſe of Commons aſſembled in Parliament hath referred to your conſideration, and examination, ſome matters touching the Reformation of the Cathedrall in Canterbury: out of my zeale to that worke, I have preſumed to hold the Candle to you (Phyſitians of value) a little to further your diſcovery of that Cathedralls corrupt conſtitution, that you may more perfectly cure the malignant diſeaſe, called the Cathedrall evill. The worke is begun, the numerous Idols, (dunghill-gods, as the Scripture calls them) which defile the worſhip of God there, are ſweeping out apace. And Oh that you would further cleanſe that Augean ſtable, by removing the Idol Shepheards; Let not the oyle of the fat revenues of that Cathedrall Covent any longer feed ſuch darke Lampes, and Lanthornes, but let it ſupply

burning, and ſhining lights, to enlighten thoſe many miſerable adjacent Pariſhes, which have a long time ſate in darkeneſſe, under that huge, dry, flintie Rocke, called a Cathedrall. I have the enſuing Hiſtory (for the moſt part) from mine owne obſervation, and have beene punctuall in examining the truth of what I have by information. My ayme is to further the downefall of Babylon, and that Sion, which dwelleth with this daughter of Babylon, may deliver her ſelfe. So moſt humbly intreating your acceptance of this my obliged ſervice, I remaine

Yours to be commanded, RICHARD CVLMER.
