To the Right Honourable EDWARD Lord Viscount CONWAY and KILLULTAH; Baron of RAGLEY; Lord Marshall of the Army, and Privy Counsellour of IRELAND; and one of the Counsell of Warre to His MAIESTY of GREAT BRITTAINE.

MY LORD,


THis Stranger, who hath newly learnt the English Tongue, dares not venture himselfe in Publick, without a Patronage; which, with all humblenesse, he intreats of Your Lordship. The great Affection, Your Lordship hath shewne to the Spanish Language; and the Benignity, wherewith You are pleased to entertaine whatsoever relisheth of Art, or Ingenuity; makes him hope, You will not refuse Your Favour and Protection to one of that Nation.

Nor knowes he, where to shelter himselfe with so much safety; the Eminence of Your Person, and Judgement, being of power to secure him, from all petulant and malicious Exceptions. Be pleased then, my Lord, to receive him with Favour: So may those Excellent, and Naturall Beauties of this happy Isle (who shall have either Health or Pleasure, from this Confection) be ever serene, and gratefull to Your Lordship; presaging encrease of Honour, and all Felicity, answerable to the humble Devotion, and hearty Prayers of

Your Lordships most obedient, and obliged Servant Don Diego V'ades-forte.
