I
 Charge thee before God, who quickneth all things, and before Jeſus Chriſt, who witneſſed a good confeſſion that thou read theſe Exhortations, meditate and teach them, unto others: that ſo thy profiting

may be known unto all men. Let no man deſpiſe thy youth, but be thou an example of believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity. And the God of peace, who brought again from the dead Chriſt Jeſus, that great Shepherd of our ſouls, through the bloud of the eternal covenant, eſtabliſh thee unto every good work for the performance of his will; working in

thee that which is acceptable in his ſight by Jeſus Chriſt: Theſe things I entreat thee, I exhort and beſeech thee, who am

Cal.
