TO THE Right Honourable THE HOUSE OF PEERS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.

Right Honourable,


THe wrath of God ſo variouſly and dreadfully revealed from heaven of late againſt this Nation; and all the ungodlineſſe and unrighttouſneſſe of men therein, for which Gods wrath hath been ſo revealed, do call and cry aloud to all the Kingdom for mature and true Repentance. To the making up of true Repentance (that holy change of the ſinners perſon and converſation) theſe Four neceſſary and eminent ingredients ſeem principally required: viz. 1. Conviction of ſin, Joh. 16. 8, 9▪ 2. Contrition for ſin, Pſal. 51. 17. Acts 2. 36, 37. 2 Cor. 710. 
〈◊〉
. Avorſion, or turning away from ſin, both in inward Principles, and outward Practices, Iſai. 1. 16. and 55. 7. Ezek. 18▪ 30, 31 32▪ And 4. Converſion to God in Chriſt, both in hear
•
 and life, Iſai. 557. and

1. 17. Hoſ. 14. 12. Jerem. 4▪ 1. Joel 2. 12, 13. For till the Conſcience be convinced of ſin, how ſhall the heart be contrite for ſin? till the heart be contrite and kindly broken for ſin, how ſhall it forſake and turn away from ſin? Till the beart truely turn away from ſin, how ſhould it acceptably convert or return to God? And till the ſinner do return even unto God, how can he be ſaid compleatly and truely to repent?

1. In Conviction of ſin, theſe things ſeem ſpecially implied: viz. 1. A ſin-guiltineſſe wherewith the ſinner may be charged. All have ſinned, Rom. 5. 12. and Chriſt alone was holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, Heb. 7. 26. and none could convince him of ſin, Joh. 8. 46. 2. Clear and evident Manifeſtation of that ſin-guiltineſſe to the ſoul, by the divine light of the Word and Spirit of God, Pſal. 50. 21. Joh. 3. 1920. Epheſ. 5. 13. 3. Reflection, and the turning in of the ſoul upon it ſelf, to take a deliberate view of ſin manifeſted. If they ſhall bethink themſelves:


〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

 Heb. If they ſhall return unto their heart: or, If they ſhall bring back unto their beart, 1 Kings 8. 47. 4. And finally, a ſelf-ſentencing, upon this ſelf-reflection, as clearly guilty of ſuch ſin, or ſinfulneſſe; as 2 Sam. 12. 13. with Pſal. 51. 4.
2. In Contrition for ſin, theſe things ſeem peculiarly to be contained: viz. 1. The ſouls deep apprehenſiveneſſe of the hatefulneſſe, abominableneſſe, and ſinfulneſſe of ſin wherewith it is convinced, ſeriouſly laying it to heart, as being moſt lively and clearly ſenſible thereof. Pſal. 51. 3. My ſin is ever before me. 2. The hearts hating, deteſting and abominating of theſe iniquities with indignation, ſo deeply apprehended, as the greateſt burdens, diſeaſes, deformities, evils or enemies in the world, 2 Cor. 7. 11. 3. The ſpirits inward relenting, melting, and mourning bitterly for ſin thus deteſted and abhorred, Zech. 12, 10, 11, 12. 2 Cor. 7. 10. 2 Chron. 34 27. 4. The ſinners deep debaſing humbling, loathing and abhorring themſelves for their iniquities ſo abominated and lamented. 2 Chron. 33. 12. Ezek. 6. 9, and 20 43. and 36. 31. Job 42. 6▪

Now theſe inward acts of Contrition oft-times have been of old repreſented by Gerh. loc. com. De Poenitent. Tom. 3. c. 11. §1.
outward diſcoveries and expreſſions of 1. Fasting, as counting themſelves unworthy of all food,

Joel 1. 14. 2. Rending of garments, denoting the renting of the heart, Joel 2. 13. 3. Tears, which are as the blood of a wounded ſpirit, Matth. 26. ult. Luke 7. 38. 4. Lying on the ground, in ſelf-debaſement, 2 Sam. 12. 16. 5. Covering their 
•
eads with aſhes, as counting themſelves more vile then duſt and aſhes, Nehem. 9. 1. Job 42. 6. Luke 10. 13. 6. Sackcloth, courſeſt garments, Eſth. 43. Jonah 34. 7. Smiting upon the thigh, through inward anguiſh and anxiety, Percutere femur eſt ſignum doloris, ſicut mulierculae in puerperio facere ſolent. Luth. in Gloſt. marginal.
 as a travelling woman in extremity of pangs, Jer. 31. 19. 8. Beating of the brests, as deeply diſcontented at themſelves. So the prodigal ſmote his breſt—Luke 18. 13.
Sometimes theſe external expreſſions are without the inward acts of Contrition, and then they are but as Crocodiles tears, but meer hypocritical paintings. When outward expreſſions and inward Contrition go together, they are melody delectable even to heaven it ſelf.
3. In Averſion from ſin, are remarkable, 1. A new and ſecret antipathy in the ſoul againſt ſin, from an oppſite principle of grace infuſed, Gal. 517. Theſe two are contrary one to another. 2. Ceaſing to do evil both in the elicite and imperate acts of heart and life, Iſai. 1. 16. called denying ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, Tit. 2. 11. putting away all filthineſſe and ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe, Jam. 1. 21. putting off of the old man, Col. 3. 9. casting away of abominations as a menſtruons cloth, ſaying to it, Get thee hence, Iſai. 30. 22. &c. 3. Breaking off the occaſions, inlets, inducements and temptations to evil for time to come, Pſal. 119. 115. as Peter fled from the highprieſts hall where he was tempted, Matth. 26. ult. 4. Maintaining a conſtant inteſtine combat againſt ſin, that it may be mortified, killed, extirpated at laſt out of the ſoul. Gal. 5. 17. the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh. See Rom. 8. 13.
4. Finally, in converſion or turning to God in Chriſt, are conſiderable, 1. The Motives inclining and alluring the ſinner unto God; viz. extreme want and miſery in himſelf, but compleat fulneſſe and felicity in God: How many hired ſervants of my fathers have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger? Luke 15. 17. 2. Reſolution upon thoſe incitements to turn unto God. I will ariſe, and go to my Father,

Luke 15. 18, 20. 3. Self-denying groans, deſires, cries, for admittance and acceptance. Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon: make me as one of thine hired ſervants, Luk. 15 18, 19. 4 Sweet cloſing with God as his God in Covenant; ſ

•…
t: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry, Luke 15. 20. 22, 23. O when Repentance thus leads the poor ſoul into the preſence of God as a Father, with what unſpeakable contentment do they embrace and enjoy one another!

ſuch ſins as God hath been wont of old to Threaten or Puniſh with SVVORD, PESTILENCE, or FAMINE; or with all at once: That the wo of former ages may be our warning: For All theſe things happened unto them for enſamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, 1 Cor. 10. 11.

And 3. That breach was eſpecially made by King Saul and his bloody houſe. Compare 2 Sa

Thus have I briefly indigitated out of the word of God ſome of thoſe ſins and abominations in theſe ſeveral Catalogues, for which the Lord hath heretofore threatned and plagued his people with SVVORD, PESTILENCE, and FAMINE, (two of which this Kingdome of late hath

adly f

lt, and the third is greatly feared;) That your Honours may cleerly ſee the equity of Gods ſevereſt proceedings with us in all this that is come upon us: and the neceſſity of our breaking our hearts, and humbling our ſoules greatly in this Land for all thoſe Sins and Rebellions wherewith we have already pulled ſo much, and are like to pull down more and more vengeance upon our ſelves and our Poſteritie. For, which of all thoſe Abominations fore-mentioned is not England deeply guilty of? And ſhall England think to commit the ſame ſins, and yet eſcape the judgements of God?
Wherefore I moſt humbly and earneſtly beſeech your Honours, that as you tender the glory of God; the true happineſſe of this Church and State; the removing of preſent, and preventing

of future judgements; the treaſuring up of bleſſings for the preſent generation and for poſterity; and the re-imbarquing of England again in the boſome of Gods favour; you would be pleaſed in your great zeal and wiſdome, to think of ſome way, how with the advice of the Aſſembly of Divines, a more full and impartiall Catalogue (then hitherto hath been made) of the Publick ſins and provocations of England may be drawn up, and publiſhed by Authority of Parliament; and that a moſt ſolemn Day of Humiliation for the whole Kingdome may be peculiarly ſet apart for afflicting of our ſouls deeply for thoſe ſins, from Dan to Beerſheba: And let the Lord accept us. Now the Father of mercies and God of all conſolation, lift up your hearts in the wayes of God, and make you ſtrong for all the work of God that remains upon your hand. So prayeth

Your Honours faithfull ſervant in the Lord,
FRAN. ROBERTS.
