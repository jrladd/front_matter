To the Honest-hearted READER.
READER,

IHere protest before the Searcher of all hearts, that I have no End, either of Faction, or Relation in this ensuing Treatise. I am no Papist, no Sectarie, but a true Lover of Reformation & Peace: My Pen declines all bitternesse of Spirit; all deceitfulnesse of heart; and I may safely, in this particular, with saint PAVL, say, I speake the truth in Christ and lye not, my Conscience bearing me witnesse in the holy Ghost, that I neither walke nor write in craftinesse, nor handle the

holy Scriptures deceitfully: Therefore if thy Cause be Iesus Christ, in the name of Iesus Christ, I adjure thee to lay aside all wilfull ignorance, all prejudice, all private respects and Interests, and all uncharitable censures: Deale faithfully with thy Soul, and suffer wholesome admonitions: Search the severall Scriptures herein contained, and where they open a Gate, climbe not thou over a Stile, Consult with Reason herein exerciz'd, and where it finds a mouth, find thou an eare: And let Truth prosper, though thou perish; and let God be glorified, although in thy Confusion.
