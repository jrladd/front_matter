TO THE MOST ACCOMPLISH'D Sr. Kenelme Digby.


Sr.


THat it pleaſed you to caſt an eye of favour upon theſe poor Plays has given me the boldneſſe, not only to publiſh them (which I thought not to have done) but to ſhelter them, though moſt unworthy, under that name, to which for authority and approbation the richeſt pieces that this nation can boaſt, might be proud to flie. You are to learning what learning is to others a gracefull ornament; and known not only able to receive, but fit to make that which we call literature; it being nothing elſe but rules and obſervations drawne at the firſt from ſuch able natures as yours is; and by your daily converſation is better expreſſed, then wee by writing can define it. Your compoſition was made to juſtifie thoſe old Philoſophers who reſembled a man to the whole world. For as in the world

all varieties do meet to make a perfect harmony
•
 ſo in the largneſſe of your ſoule the ſeverall abilities of moſt different Nations are conjoyned to an honourable advantage of one entire temper, where the predominancies are magnanimi
•
ty, prudence, and gentleneſſe. But I dare not offer to crowd into a narrow Epiſtle your nobl
•
 Character, which will require a longer Treatiſe and a better pen. For the defects in theſe two Plays, I that have already been ſo much obliged to your goodneſſe in other matters, cannot here deſpaire of your forgiveneſſe, which i
•
 the only thing that puts confidence into


Your moſt obliged and devoted ſervant Tho. May.
