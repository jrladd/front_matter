TO MY
MOST GRATIOVS
SOVERAIGNE
KING CHARLES.

SIR,


I Beleeve you to be
such a Patron of
Vertue, that if this
Treatise had the
least probabilitie
of cherishing Vice,
my countenance durst not admit

a thought of this dedication to
your Majestie.
But my owne reason (seconded
by better approbations)
assures mee, these Disquisitions
and Prayers are like to beget
grace in those where it was
not, and confirme it where it
was.
And being so usefull, I dare
not doubt your patronage of this
Child, which survives a Father
whose utmost abilities were (till
death darkned that great light in
his soule) sacrificed to your service.
But, if I could question your
willing protection of it, I might
strengthen my petition for it,

by an unquestionable commendation
of the Authors publisht
meditations, in most of which
(even those of Poetry begun in
his youth) there are such tinctures
of Pietie, and Pictures of
devout passions, as gain'd him
much love, and many Noble
friends.
One of that number (which
is not to bee numbred) was
the Religious, Learned, Peaceable,
humble Bishop of Armagh;
whom I beseech God to blesse,
and make your Majestie and
him, in these bad, sad times, instruments
of good to this distracted,
distemper'd Church and
State.


This is my unfained prayer:
and I doubt not but all that wish
well to Sion will seale it with
their Amen.


Your Majesties poore
and most faithfull
Subject,
RICHARD ROYSTON.
