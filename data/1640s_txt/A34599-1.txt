To all the Churches of
Ieſus the Chriſt, coming out of
Myſticall Babylon, gathered, or
ſcattered, that follow the Lambe,
the Lord JESUS whereſoever
he goeth.

BEloved in CHRIST,
Diſdaine not to Read this
Learned Treatiſe of Maſter
John Cotton, of Boſton
in New-England,
out of any prejudice thou mayeſt take againſt
the perſon, or publiſher of it.
What if ſome judge him a Schiſmaticke?
yet he regardeth not mans raſh
cenſure: Seeing he can with holy Paul,
that before his Converſion perſecuted the
Church of God, ſafely Apologiſe for
himſelfe; Acts 24. 14. That after
the way that you call Hereſie, ſo

worſhip I the God of my Fathers;
beleeving all things that are written
in the Law, and in the Prophets.
Verſe 15. And have an hope toward
God, which you your ſelves alſo
allow, that there ſhall bee a reſurrection
of the dead, both of
the juſt, and unjuſt. Verſe 16. And
herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe, to
have alwaies a Conſcience void of
offence toward God & towardman.
But yet this I confeſſe unto you, that I am
leſſe then the leaſt of all the Meſſengers
of Chriſt; for I am not worthy to bee
called a Meſſenger, or Miniſter; for I
perſecuted the Church of God, that profeſſed
the Faith of Jeſus the Chriſt;
that held foorth all his Royall Offices,
King, Prophet, Prieſt, according to
his outward adminiſtration, in admitting
of Members into his Spiritual
Kingdome: And ſided with the Antichriſtian
Prelates, and Biſhops, that
denyed, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, whom
the Spirit of God calleth Lyars, and
Antichriſtians, That denyeth the Father

and the Sonne, 1 John 2. 22.
For though I, with the Antichriſtian
Biſhops, and Prieſts, did acknowledge
Jeſus the Chriſt, our high Prieſt that
ever liveth to reconcile us unto God;
yet wee have perſecuted them that hold
his Kingly and Propheticall Office to
be eternall, aſwell as his Prieſthood, and
the gathering of his Church according
to his Royall Commiſsion, Matth. 28.
18, 19, 20. Hence it is, that Chriſt
divided, becometh no Chriſt to the divider;
this according to the Vulgar
Latine, Solvere Jeſum, to diſſolue Jeſus,
that is, to receive him onely in
part, and not in the whole, which is the
ſpirit of Antichriſt. Now when the
Lord opened the eyes of my underſtanding,
and convicted me of all the abominations
I had done in my ſpirituall
Captivity under Antichriſt, eſpecially,
that I had crucified Jeſus the Chriſt
in his Members, being pricked in my
heart, I trembling cryed, what ſhall I
doe? The Spirit and the Bride, the
Lambes wife, ſaid; Repent, and be

Baptized in the name of Jeſus, &c.
Then I gladly received the Word, was
Baptized, and was added to the Church,
Acts 2. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. Yet, by the
grace of God, now I am, what I am;
And having from ſome Friends, received
this Learned Conference, kept
it by mee as a precious Diamond of
great worth, from which my ſoule,
through the great goodneſſe of God, did
reape much ſpirituall comfort. And
did wait, hoping that ſome learned and
faithfull friends of his, would long agoe
have Printed a larger, and an exacter
Copy of it: But finding none, (I
that am leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints)
could not any longer conceale it, but
thought with my ſelfe, I was bound in
Conſcience to publiſh it, in this learned
Age, wherein there is ſo much
enquiry after truth, for the benefit of
poore, hungry, empty, ſelfe-denying
Spirits; rather then ſuch a Learned
Tract of heavenly light, ſhould alwaies
lye in the duſt, as unſeene, and forgotten.
For this cauſe alone, I have attempted

(Courteous Reader) to preſent

•
o thy view this Learned Treatiſe; Not

•
hat I have any relation to that Lear

•
ed
man; nor any command from him

•
o doe it: But onely in love, that this
his Learned Diſputation might not bee

•
uried in ſilence. Read it therefore (Beloved
in Chriſt) not for his ſake that
publiſheth it; but for his ſake that was

•
he Author of it; or rather for the God

•
f Truths ſake. For whoſe cauſe the
Learned Author contendeth for the
Faith in theſe daies, wherein the Goſ

•
ell
of Truth hath ſuffered ſo great Ec

•
lipſes,
through the rage and tyranny of
the Popiſh Antichriſtian Prelates and
Prieſts.

Thine that earneſtly deſireth to
exalt the Lord Jeſus the
Chriſt, in all his royall Offices
FRAN. CORNWELL.
