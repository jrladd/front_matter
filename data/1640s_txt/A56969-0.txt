TO My much honoured, and no lesse truly beloved Friend, EDW. BENLOWES, Esquire.


My dear Friend,


YOu have put the Theorboe into my hand, and I have played: You gave the Musician the first encouragement; the Musick returneth to you for Patronage. Had it been a light Ayre, no doubt but it had taken the most; and among them the worst: But being a grave Strayn, my hopes are, that it will please the best; and among them, You. Toyish Ayres please triviall eares: They kisse the fancy, and betray it: They cry, Hail, first; and after, Crucifie: Let Dorrs

delight to immerd themselves in dungwhilest Eagles scorn so poore a Game as Flies. Sir, you have Art and Candour: Let the one judge, let the other excuse

Your most affectionate Friend, FRA. QUARLES
