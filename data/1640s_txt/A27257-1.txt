THE
AUTHOR, TO the
READER.

WHen Johnson, Drayton, and those happier men
That can drop wonders from their fluent Pen:
Have with their miracles of Poetry
Feasted thy eares and satisfi'd thy eye;
Then turne aside, and 'mongst the vulgar things,
Place what my new-borne Muse abruptly sings.


Which though it be but meane (as tis confest)
'T hath ventured hard to please thee, since tis prest.
If thou smile on it, I shall thinke my braine
Hath labour'd for this issue not in vaine,
If otherwise thou doe contemne my layes,
My pleasur's more to me, then all thy praise.


—Sat est pro laude Voluptas.—

Vale. THOMAS BEEDOME.
