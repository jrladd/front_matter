TO MY HONOURED Patron, Sir ARTHUR INGRAM the younger.
SIr, I have obſerved you active in your converſation abroad and at home, and I could not ſtudy any thing I thought more ſutable, and congruous, than theſe practicall leaſes, which may at once recreate and instruct your retirement, instruct you not as mine but Gods, for his words are my ground and foundation both for place and ſenſe, and in this courſe I foreſaw

ſaw most ſecurity, for heere I have his Word for what I ſay, and I give you his Word for what you are to doe, and my lines are but onely drawne here to point you to the center of the Scriptures: there your deſignes, your projects, may rest and relie.
Sir, I know you have a breast-plate rich enough of your owne, yet to ſet an higher rate upon your counſels, bee pleaſed to let theſe holy jewels of Gods Word (which will bee a bright Urim and Thummim to your boſom
•
) have a place, and that I may be just to the brevity I profeſſe in my Booke, I hasten to bee as I am ever bound, Sir,

Your moſt devoted Servant J. SALTMARSHE.
