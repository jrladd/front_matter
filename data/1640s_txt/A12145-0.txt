TO
THE WORTHILY
Honoured, Henry Osborne Esquire.

SIR,


TIll J be able to give you a better proofe of my
service, let  
•
ot this oblation be despised. It is a
Tragedy which received encouragement and
grace on the English Stage; and though it
come late to the Impression, it was the second
birth in this kinde, which I de 
•
icated
to the Scene, as you have Art to distinguish; you have mercy
and a smile, if you finde a Poem infirme through want of
age, and experience the mother of strength. It is many yeares
since I see these papers, which make haste to kisse your hand;
if you doe not accuse the boldnesse and pride of them; I will
owne the child, and beleeve Tradition so farre, that you will
receive no dishonour by the acceptance; I never affected the
wayes of flattery: some say I have lost my preferment, by
not practising that Court sinne; but if you dare beleeve, I
much honour you, nor is it upon guesse, but the taste and
knowledge of your abilitie and merit; and while the Court
wherein you live, is fruitfull with Testimonies of your mind,
my Character is seal'd up, when I have said that your vertue
hath taken up a faire lodging. Read when you have leasure,
and l 
•
t the Author be fortunate to be knowne


Your Servant,
IAMES SHIRLEY.
