To all the Lovers of Truth, and Peace, ſpecially thoſe in the Towne of Great Yarmouth.

TO ſome of you were theſe Meditations lately preached; For all of you they are now Publiſhed. My Deſigne in both is, (that which ſhould bee the Deſire of every true Iſraelite) The Healing of the Breaches in this our Iſrael. And my Hopes are that there is not a line within the Circumference of this Tract, which is not drawne directly to this Center. If any ſhall thinke otherwiſe, let them miſtruſt

their owne eyes, which, being dazeled, will make the Sun-beames (though moſt direct in themſelves) ſeeme diſtort, and crooked. Sure I am, what ever my lines may ſeeme to bee, my Intentions have beene right. Theſe I can approve to God who knowes them, and the other (I truſt) ſhall approve themſelves to thoſe who (being not prejudiced) are able to judge of them. If herein I fall ſhort of my Marke, let it be enough I have aymed, and ſhot at it.
In magnis voluiſſe—

Yours, devoted to the ſervice of Gods Truth, and the Churches Peace, IOH. BRINSLY.
