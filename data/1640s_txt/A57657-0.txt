TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM Marquesse of Hartford, Lord Governour to the PRINCE His Highnesse.

MY LORD:


THe duty of affection which I beare to the memory of your Honourable Grand-father, the true Maecenas of my young Muses whilst he lived; the knowledge which I have of your eminent worth, both for learning, religion, and courtesie, your good opinion and kind usage of me, still, when I had the happinesse to see you, have imboldned me to grace the frontispice of this begun worke, with your Honourable name, it is the fruit of some sequestred houres from my Divinity exercises, it hath lyen long neglected among my other

papers, but by the importunity of some worthy friends, drawn out at last unto the light; here may be seen what use can be made of poeticall fictions: The spoiles of Aegyptians, and a Babylonish garment, may be serviceable for the Tabernacle. Accept this small present as a pledge and testimony of that duty and service which I owe to your self, and honourable Family, to whom I wish all increase of true happinesse, which still shall be the prayer of

Your Honours in all duty and service devoted,
ALEXANDER ROSSE.
