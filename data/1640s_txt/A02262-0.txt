TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTIE.

SIR,

I Am bold to preſent you with this Peece of the PASSION, the Originall deſigned by the curious Penſill of Grotius: whoſe former afflictions ſeeme to have taught him pliable paſsions, and art to rule the affections of others: cloathing the ſaddeſt of Subjects in the ſutable attire of Tragedy; not without the Example of two ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church, Apollinarius and Nazianzen. The Argument is

of both the Teſtaments a patheticall Abſtract. Thoſe formidable Wonders, effected by God in his owne Common-wealth; thoſe ſtupendious Miracles, for truth a Pattern to all Hiſtory, for ſtrangeneſſe to all Fables; here meet together to attend on CHRIST'S PASSION. The effects of his Power here ſweetly end in thoſe of his Mercy: and that terrible Lord of Hoſts, is now this meeke God of Peace; reconciling all to one another, and Man-kinde to Him-ſelfe. Sr. in this change of Language I am no punctuall Interpreter: a way as ſervill as ungracefull. Quintilian cenſures a Painter,

that he more affected Similitude then Beauty; who would have ſhown greater Skill, if leſſe of Reſemblance: the ſame in Poetry is condemned by Horace; of that Art the great Law-giver. Thus in the Shadow of your Abſence, diſmiſt from Arms by an Act of Time, have I, in what I was able, continued to ſerve you.

The humbleſt of your Majeſties Servants, GEORGE SANDYS.
