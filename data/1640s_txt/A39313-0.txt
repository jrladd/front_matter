NOble Princes and Patriots, remember in all your Lawes and Ordinances, that as Ieſus ChriſtRev. 1. 5. (who is the faithfull witneſſe, and will be one day for his truth and People) is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, and hath▪ made the Saints who are his Anointed ones (1 Iohn 2▪ 27.) Kings and Prieſt to God and his Father, ſo is he the one onely Law giver, who is ableRev 1. 6. Iam. 4▪

 Magiſtrate ſhould be incenſed againſt them & ſhould by all wayes be ſolicited, not to give them a toleration that it, not to ſuffer them when they have ſo faithfully engaged for them: The field in the Parable muſt have ſome interpretation, it muſt have reference to Church or State, Chriſt would have them ſuffered ſome where, but their adverſaries who pretend ſo much for Chriſt, are indeed in this particular as in many other things Antichriſt, i. e. againſt Chriſt, he ſaith let them grow together, theſe men ſay nay, let them be pulled up, lamentable will the condition of many people in this Kingdome, and other places be, if many choiſe young men and others, who are ordained by Ieſus Chriſt to eternall life and glory, and have received a large portion of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt (the only teacher of his people) whereby they may edifie and build others up in the moſt holy faith, if the mouths of theſe muſt be ſtopped for want of that empty and fruitleſſe (as is conceived) Ceremony of Ordination, which the doctrine (peradventure) of the Presbyterie of Scotland hath tought, their conſciences to ſtartle at and deny: for in the I. booke of the Diſciplin of the Kirke of Scotland commanded to be practiſed in the ſame Kirks. Anno Dom. 1641. under the head of Admiſſion, this they teach. pag. 31. Other Ceremony then the publick Approbation of the people, and Declaration of the chiefe Miniſter, that the perſon there preſented is appointed to ſerve the Church. We cannot approve, ſon all be it, the Apoſtles uſed Impoſition of Hands, yet ſeeing the miracle is ceaſed, the uſing of the Ceremony, we iudge not neceſſary.
If any gift were conveyed who would deny, nay, who would not rejoyce to be partaker of it but whilſt men ſee that this is but a vain Imitation of that primitive Apoſtolical Presbytety, who had received from Ieſus Chriſt and could convey to others ſuch gifts of the Spirit for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel as have been loſt whilſt we have been under the power of Antichriſt, and ſuch as none of the Sons of men have received at this day, and therefore cannot beſtow on others, they are exceedingly troubled in their Spirits, & can iudge the ceremony at the leaſt but a taking of Gods name in vaine: Let my counſell then (wiſe Counſellors) be acceptable touching theſe men, that as in all your Declarations

whilſt you had any need of them either in their Perſons or Eſtates, 
〈…〉

have ingaged to be tender towards them; which Tenderneſſe they could conceive to be no leſſe then a continued liberty in 
〈…〉
 ſeverall wayes of worſhip, which they then enjoyed, and not after the leſſe of many of their lives, and a parting with a good part of ther lively. hoods for your preſervation, an impriſoning of their perſons, and a waſting of the remainder, by Attendance, Suites, Fees, Fines, and ſuch other charges as neceſſarily attend ſuch a condition.
And all this for the practiſe of thoſe very things you ſeemed then to allow in them, when you thus time after time declared Tenderneſſe towards them, oh doe not, doe not thus keep promiſe with them, let not this

 you thus already, before they have any power in ther hands, conſider I pray what they would doe, if power ſhould be given them according to their deſire, we have too lately bought repentance from their prediceſſors the Biſhops at too dear arate al which I lay before you, and if you pleaſe to peruſe this tract, you ſhall ſee theſe men proved the greateſt Hereticks and Schiſmaticks in the Kingdome at this day: And as touching theſe men who are ſo much reproached by them, you ſhall find them to be according to what they underſtand, pure in religion, having not the forme, but the power of godlineſſe in their publique and private meetings, dayly praying the Lord for you, innocent in their lives, inoffenſive in their converſations, peaceable in the places where they live, and obedient to your iuſt power. Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in all his goings out with them in th

ſe few laſt yeares, not only opening their purſes, buts

their very bowels and hearts, making them ready and willing to ſpend & to be ſpent for you, hath given both to your ſelves & al the world in all ages to come, a ſufficient demonſtration of their harmleſſeneſſe, integrity & faithfulneſſe unto you, and if you wil not beleeve theſe ſpeaking out on their behalfe, neither would yee, if an Angel from heaven ſhould come and witneſs for them. Now the God of wiſedome give you to diſ

erne betwixt truth, and errour betwixt good and evill, friends and enemies, Saints and Hereticks: and to hearken to the wiſe counſell of Gameliel, a great Statiſt concerning the Sectaries of thoſe times: Acts 5. 35. 38. 39. with which I ſhall conclude, take heed to your ſelves what you intend to doe at touching theſe men, refraine from theſe men, and let them alone; for if this counſell or worke be of men it will come to naught, but if it be of God; yee cannot overthrow it, leaſt happily yee be even found fighters againſt God.


I verily thought I ought to doe many things againſt the name ofActs 26. 9. 10. 11. Ieſus.
And many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon, I puniſht them oft, and compelled them to blaſpheme, and I perſecuted them even to ſtrange Cities.
