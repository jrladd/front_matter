Honored Sir,



AS I did frequently take fresh aire in your Dodonaean grove attending the Articulate, and intelligible susurrations of your ever verdant vegitals, (to which former ages have nothing (in that kind) to assimulate, neither shall future times be able to parallel,) from these Apollinean Plants of yours, I have slifted here a twig, and there a sprig, and I have bestowed some time in binding them in a bundle, which with my selfe I humbly offer to your approved censure, it being the Apex of my ambition to have your honour'd selfe my justice in Eyre, I cannot say with Persius
