TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE CHRISTOPHER CLETHEROW, Lord Maior of the honourable City of London; whoſe dignity and proſperity, God long continue.

WHat it pleaſed your Honour to deſire, may it pleaſe you alſo to accept (a poore mans Sermon.) I have no other plea, nor other hopes nor meanes to find grace in your eyes (ſeeing I am a ſtranger,) but only for that Grace's ſake, which is the theam and ſubject, the pith and marrow of my text. In a word therefore, As Iacob prayed heartily for his ſons, when they went to preſent themſelves before Ioſeph,

Gen. 43. 14. God Almighty give you mercy in the ſight of the man: Such is my hearty prayer to Almighty God; God Almighty give mee mercy in your ſight, and you in his ſight, Oratum eſt,


Your Honours poore ſervant and ſuppliant,
IOHN GORE.
