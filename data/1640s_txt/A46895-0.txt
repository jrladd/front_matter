TO THE RIGHT
Honourable Sr RICHARD
GURNY Knight and Baronet,
Lord Major of the City
of London, together with
the Right Worshipfull the
Sheriffes and Aldermen of
the same City, The continuall
feast of a good Conscience
be ever multiplyed.

SIRS,

MAy it please you, The
Scottish King being
imprisoned in Mortimers
hole, comforted himself
and deceived the sorrowes
of his bondage, by scraping



the Story of Christ crucified
upon the wals, with his
nailes: Even so God writeth
the lawes, and dictates of
Conscience upon a wall, the
wall of Conscience, Murus
aheneus; so as all the rules
of Divinity, of nature, of
nations, and of positive
lawes, as they relate to Conscience,
are like the handwriting,
Dan. 5. herbae Parietariae,
wall-flowers. And
they are written and sculptured
with a naile too; but a
more stiffe and potent naile
then that of the Scottish
King. Judge not ex ungue,
&c. but by a retrograde
crisis, judge the naile by the
finger, which is expresly called



digitus Dei, Exod. 31. 18.
and what can the naile of
such a finger be, but unguis
adamantinus, as it is adjuncted,
Jer. 17. 1? and need it
hath to be no lesse, unlesse
the pen be more soft then the
paper: for if our hearts be
hearts of adamant, Zech.
7. 12. then the stile that
writes characters upon them
had need be a pen of iron,
and the naile of an Adamant.
I present here your Worthinesses
with a booke; a
booke, as St Bernard ingeniously,
for the rectifying
whereof, all other bookes are
written; I except not the



very Booke of bookes it self.
For there are foure Bookes
written by God, for the sons
of men, which are thus to be
classed and ordered. They
are either the Bookes of
Grace, or of Nature. The
Bookes of Grace are either
outwar
•
 or inward. The outward
Booke of Grace is the
holy Bible. The inward Book
of Grace is the holy Spirit,
the great Doctor of the
Church. The outward booke
of nature is the world, or book
of the Creatures, which is
God unfolded. The inward
Booke of nature is this
very booke, whose seales I
have, in the ensuing Tra

••
a
•
e,
broke open, the Book of



Conscience, so called Apoc.
20. 12.
That which one likes another
will dislike; some have
been such grosse flatterers as
to commend Nero, and some
againe such detractors as to
dispraise Trajan; one mans
pottage will be anothers coloquintida;
the same son was
Rachels Ben-oni & Jacob's
Benjamin. The same in
scription on the plaister
which made Belshazzar
quiver for feare, made Darius,
his successor quav
•
r for
joy. The very same facultie
of Conscience which entertaines
and feasts one, starves
or choakes another.


And the Commentary
must not looke for a better
lot then the Text, nor the
Sermon then the Theame. I
know too well the wayes of
this towne, to expect other:
but for the publishing hereof,
I have this excuse, which
must prevaile with an ingenuous
nature, that I have
beene mastered by entreaties
thereunto, so as if there
be any errour, in that regard,
their burthen must
be my case.
Now I pray God keep your
Honour, and Worships, in
grace, unto glory, and that as
the best meanes▪ conducing
to that end, you here exercise
your selves to keep a good



Conscience in all things, both
towards God, and towards
man.

Your Hon. and Wor. humble, and
faithfull Servant, in the things
of God, and Christ,
JOHN JACKSON.
