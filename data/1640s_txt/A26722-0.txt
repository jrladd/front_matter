TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL
Sr. JOHN WOLLASTON,
Knight and Alderman of the
Honourable City of London.

Right worshipfull,


SVch are my known ingagements to
your self, and your worthy and
vertuous Lady, that all men may
justly expect (if God put any
thing into my hands) I should not
defraud you of the honour and acknowledgements
which I owe to you both, but rejoyce to
expresse my gratitude to God almighty, in raising
up to me such speciall and precious friends, to
so great advantage and increase of my long-despaired
health, as hath made me of late to omit
complaints, and many to wonder at the change.
Besides, Sir, your own cost and kindnesse
hath been, by Gods blessing, the onely Sun-shine
to ripen these my labours, & produce them to the
publike, and that (breaking thorow so may difficulties)
I should be able to bring them to this
perfection, that at least they are usefull while the

old ones are in use, for 35. whole ones of these
and many parts and pieces of the rest (which
call Collects) are (verse for verse) of the sam
•

quantity with the old, and may be sung in publike,
while some (wedded to custom) sing the old
without any incongruity at all: so that n
•
ne can
possibly point out any considerable psalm, or par
•

of a psalm, that is well done of the old, but her
•

it is to be found, and the absurdities removed
neither is any thing left out, which is not so poor
and imperfect, or far off the words and sense, a
•

that it is requisite to be made wholly new, or i
•

not already taken into the new.
Wherefore I humbly present it as a token of
my thankfulnesse, praising the Lord for you, and
praying the Lord to enrich you, and my much
Honoured Lady with abundance of heavenly
forwardnesse, faithfulnesse, and fruitfulnesse,
which may be summed up to the glory of God, and
furtherance of our account in the day of Iesus
Christ our Lord,
Your worships fervent
and faithfull
Minister, to his utmost,
WILLIAM BARTON.
