TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE PHILIP Earle of Pembroke and Montgomery, &c.

My Noble Lord,


THe naturall affection, which by the ſucceſſive vertue of your Family you have alwayes borne to Poetry, ingages me in the abſence of the worthy Author, to preſent your Lordſhip this piece, that you, the beſt Maecenas of the age, might Patronize this beſt of Playes. Had Mr. Davenaut himſelfe beene preſent, hee would have elected no other Patron but your Lordſhip, and in his abſence I beſeech you accept this Worke of his; whoſe excellence, I hope, will excuſe his boldneſſe, who had no other ambition in the dedication, but that he might by publike profeſſion be knowne to be that which has long time been in his private affection,

The humble honourer of your Name and Family. W. H.
