To the moſt Sacred MAJESTY OF Henrietta Maria, Daughter of France, and Queen of Great Britain.


MADAM,


THe propriety of my Life is not ſimply by a common Right inherent in Your Crown, but likewiſe (by a ſpecial and notorious Purchaſe) is annexed unto Your Perſon; and that by ſo obliging a Title, as nothing leſs then the ceſſation of my Life, could ſeem on my part a legitimate ſeparation of my perſonal Services from Your Majeſty▪
 But in this

engaged eſtate of my life, God hath been pleaſed, by a civil death, to contrive a juſtifiable intermiſsion of my ſecular Duties, and by ſuch away, as renders even this ceſſant ſtate in ſome ſort active, and diſcharging my Obligations: Since my preſent ſuſpended condition is a conſequence of the active proſecution of my Duty to Your Majeſty, whereby even this my inanimate conſtitution, in regard of any motion in Your ſervice, ſeems enlivened by this kinde of dying in that relation; by which means my life may be ſaid to have but changed the maner of application unto You, and in place of the Spirit of Acting, to have taken that of Suffering for Your Service; So that in effect, it is but the corps, as it were, of my time that lieth thus into 
〈…〉
bed in this Region of civil death, while the Spirit thereof liveth in Your Service, by the occaſion of this my paſsive condition.
In this ſtate of violent quieſcence, my thoughts (Madam) have not ceaſed to range

and caſt about in theſe ſpacious fields of Solitude, to finde a way, how, my perſon being now like a Clock with a broken Spring, unable to give You an account of my time by my own Motion, I might contrive my preſent ſtate, as it were, into a Sun-dyal, which while it ſelf is fixed, doth by an extrinſique Motion give an account of Time: In ſome report to this Conceit, I have bethought my ſelf of drawing ſome ſuch lines within my walls, by the rules of Spiritual Mathematiques, as might (by the Motion of that Sun upon them, which commonly ſhines the brighteſt through the cloſeſt walls of Priſons, they like Chryſtal curtains, intending rather then intercepting his beams) render You, Madam, an account hereafter of my preſent time, by the ſtrange property of this Spiritual Dyal, which may mark out the paſſage, even of hours already elapſed: And, I hope, theſe lines have yet this better quality, of bearing ſome marks of the fervor and operation of this Sun upon my thoughts,

as of their courſe and motion towards Your Memory; which Impreſsion if they retain, this one act doth happily conjoyn theſe two great Duties, of Gratitude to God, and to Your Majeſty.

In my preſent conveniency (Madam) of contemplating much theſe two ſubjects, I have often reſolved, That God had deſigned You ſo ſpecially, for the mediate conveyance of all his Bleſsings to me, as that he would not miniſter this his Medicinal affliction, but as it were by the hand of Your Service; by which order he hath been pleaſed to render Your adverſity more beneficial to me, then ever Your felicity was like to prove, ſince it is not probable that Your Power would have given me what I finde now to have been moſt wanting to my Life, Sufferance and Mortification; inſomuch, as what my vain Nature needed the moſt, and Your generous one, could afford me the leaſt, hath by the accidents of Your fortune,

binfurniſhed me, with the preſervation of Your favorable conſtancy; and thus, without the blemiſh of any of Your Vertues, Your Service hath taught me Patience and Reſignation; Vertues, which though You had them habitually in Your minde, yet neither were Your Nature or Your Fortune, the one apt, or the other proper, to give Your Servants occaſion to practice them.
Nor doth this my particular bleſsing of Sufferance, endure any abatement by the ſenſe of Your perſonal afflictions; for GOD hath provided againſt this allay of it, by the improvement, at the ſame time, of all Your Vertues and Pieties; So, as in reſpect of Your Perſon, I may rejoyce likewiſe in all Your tribulations, ſince every Thorn in Your preſent Crown hath been a kinde of penſil, the ſharpeſt touches whereof have drawn You the nearer that original Head, crowned with Thorns, whoſe reſemblance ought to be Your principal intendment: And if what You have loſt of the likeneſs of a Terreſtrial Prince, hath

conferred to Your ſimilitude with that King of kings, there is made a bleſſed Transfiguration, rather then any Disfigurement of Your Image: Wherefore I may preſume (Madam) That all the preſent Breaches which Your Croſſes have made in Your Temporal ſtate, will prove in Your Eternal like the wounds of our great King of the Croſs, which are turned into the moſt glorious and reſplendent parts of his Body.
It were eaſie (Madam) to preſent You many Motives of Conſolation, derived from the ſubject of Your Troubles; but I had rather You ſhould extract them from that part therein, which ſolaceth all Your Attendants in this hard Fortune, the reſigned maner (I mean) and temper of Your Suffering, and that which eaſeth Your Servants is the likelieſt thing to confort You in this condition. You may therefore ſafely rejoyce, that Your comportment ſupplieth much the diſablement of Your Fortune, and in ſome degree relieveth all Your

diſtreſſed Party, while Your Gracious precedence in this aſperous and narrow way of the Croſs (wherein Your Vertue doth preſcribe the order of their march) may well draw every generous Minde off from the thoughts of their own private Diſtreſſes, and ſo ſuccor the nobleſt Hearts in ſome meaſure, by this vertuous diverſion, while You are unable to do it by direct ſupplies: Thus, by the influence of Your Piety, even Your Neceſsities may become Proviſions for Your Suffering Party.
Thus did King David refreſh more his Paral. 11. 18. whole Army, by bearing them company in their thirſt, then he could have done by the proviſion of many veſſels of water and as this holy King did as good as caſt that water into every thirſting mouth, which he poured out unto the Lord; ſo may You, Madam, by accepting ſtill chearfully Your own wants, and offering up to God Your Will of ſuffering in this general Calamity, relieve more univerſally Your Party, then by the diſtribution

of a great treaſure; and this may paſs for an agreeable motive to You, to attend the improvement of Your Piety, the expecting by the degrees of Your advance in ſanctity, not onely the miniſtring a good proportion of ſpiritual confort to Your diſtreſſed Servants, but likewiſe the propitiating of Almighty GOD, towards Your reinablement to afford them, all other ſuccors, whereof Your ROYAL HEART can make a
•
 Deſignation; and likewiſe by theſe Arguments of Your holy cariage in this affliction, Your Loyal Subjects may be perſwaded to expect all Your heart can promiſe them, juſtly concluding of Your Caſe, what was preſaged of holy DAVID in his Exite, Now we know certainly, that You ſhall reign, and the Kingdom ſhall be eſtabliſhed in Your hand.

Had I not, Madam, a better reaſon, then the circumſtance of my preſent condition, I ſhould, per adventure, give more liberty to my

Opinion, and impreſs more livelily by my Pen the ſignature of my Thoughts upon theſe Papers, as the true figure of Your Vertue and Merit in theſe unhappy occaſions: But Your Vertue it ſelf forbids me more then any other reflexion, knowing that the charges of Your Duties are welcomer to You, then even the due proclamation of Your Praiſes; in which regard, although it might ſeem a Service to the Nation, to endeavor by ſome reſpects and civilities to Your Majeſty, the purging a little our Language, of ſome diſloyal rudeneſs and barbariſms that have of late vitiated much this Tongue; yet will I prefer the ſatiſfaction of Your Modeſty and Humility, before the reparation of our own concernments: And ſurely, Madam, they who have the honor to know You particularly, may conclude the pleaſingeſt way of righting You, to be the leaving You the moſt to forgive thoſe who have miſunderſtood You.
I ſhall therefore rather humbly commend

unto You, the progreſs and advance of Your Pieties, then offer You any reparatory commendations; ſince by the cand
•
r of Your Charity, You may turn every bl
〈…〉
opt upon Your Name, into a beam of Splendor ſhining on it in the Book of Life; and whatſoever ſeemeth now a fear upon Your Perſon, may by the vertue of Your Patience, prove as it were ſo many ſeveral Stars compoſing one glorious Conſtallation of ſuch Merits, whereof the Prophet Daniel ſaith, They ſhall prove
Dan. 12. 3
•
.
like the ſplendor of the Firmament, and like STARS ſhining in perpetual Eternities.

Now (Madam) ſtudying what I ſhould ſay, to recommend this Offering to Your Sacred Majeſtie, I finde the nature of it to be ſuch, as rather preſcribes me Prayers for the Acceptation, then allows me to make Promiſes for the worthineſs of the Preſent; For ſuch is the order obſervable in our Oblations to GOD, and to his moſt ſpecial

Images on Earth; unto whom, as to himſelf, Servants do likewiſe not pretend to give towards the enriching them, but in order to their own Diſcharges: So (Madam) do I not preſume by this Offering of my Thoughts, to ſupply You with any New Lights requiſ
〈…〉
 for Your advance in Devotion, but rather to rejoyce Your Charity, by ſhewing it how my little Stock profits in this Royal Exchange of the Croſs, better then in the Treaſury of the Court: Nor can I conclude this account of my Time, wholly uſeleſs to Your perfection; For, as Princes do often build their Pallaces by the ſame Models which inferior perſons uſe for their houſes, enlarging onely the Dimenſions, with obſervance of the ſame Figure; So (Madam) peradventure this Draught of Devotion, formed in theſe Lines, may not ſeem unfit for Your great Soul, in point of Figure and Order, while You may raiſe Your Zeal upon it with great exceſſes, in reſpect of the

meaſures and proportions: But this I may modeſtly preſume, That though theſe lines do not pretend to be exactly fit for Your Soul, as a model of Devotion; yet they need no enlargement, as they are a Draught and Deſign of my Gratitude: In which relation, nothing can be more accompliſhed, then the Thoughts and Vows, of

Your Majeſties moſt dutiful Subject, and moſt obliged Servant.
