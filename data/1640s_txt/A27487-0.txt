THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE
THE LORDS, AND
The Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes,
of the Honourable Houſe, of
COMMONS.


GReat Senators though in thoſe ſtormy
times and Illiads of great affaires,
wee preſent to your Honours,
as one did to Antipater a
Treatiſe, the ſubject whereof is
Happineſſe; 
〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
 yet wee are Confident wee ſhall
have a better Anſwerthen I am not at leiſure. Our
humble ſuit is, for the Pure Worſhip of the true
God, and the quite aboliſhing of the Service-Book,
with the Hierarchicall Maintainers of it, both
Enmity to Chriſt, Kingdome; this (as we conceive)
is the prime Worke of the day, ſaving
health is the greateſt good,
Salus ſum mum b
•

num. and Purity in Worſhip
is the onely meanes to attaine the End, and you
are the Inſtruments of Inſtruments to advance this

Worke. We deſire no more of your Honours,
but that the Reaſons of our requeſts may be
weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, &


ut res cum re,
Hicrom
& ratio cum ratione comparetur,
that Matter with Matter, and Reaſon with
Reaſon (as a Father ſaith) may be compared,
and that which is found light may be caſt out
of the Sanctuary. It ſuits neither with the Honour
of your Place, nor greatneſſe of the work:
that you ſhould either ſee with Dr. Halls eyes,
or with ours; but that Eye-clearing word,
ſhould be the light of your Eyes, as we hope it
is: the Doctor his Charging upon Gods people
with Paſſionate reproaches, recoyles enough
upon himſelfe; though Tully telleth us, that bad
Orators, inſtead of Reaſons, Vſe, Declamations,
we could not have expected it from ſo great an
Orator as the Doctor; we ſeeke not Corban nor
Mammon, as our adverſaries doe, but the Kingdome
of Chriſt in the Purity of his Worſhip,
which is firſt of all to be ſought; for Reformations
begins at the Sanctuary. You are thoſe
Eliakims that muſt ſet the Lord upon his glorious
Throne, and hee will make you as Nayles
in a ſure place: to whoſe Honours wee ſhall
ever he devoted,

In all humble Service.
