To the Chriſtian Reader.

READER,


THou canſt not be ſuch a ſtranger in our Izrael, as that
it ſhould be neceſſary for me, to acquaint thee, with
the firſt ſowing and ſpreading of theſe Tares in the
Field of the Church, much leſſe to declare, what diviſions
and thoughts of heart, what open bitter contentions,
to the loſſe of Eccleſiaſticall peace, have beene ſtirred up amongſt
us about them: onely ſome few things relating to this my particular
endeavour, I would willingly premoniſh thee of.
Firſt, Never were ſo many prodigious errours introduced into a
Church, with ſo high a hand, and ſo little oppoſition, as theſe into
ours, ſince the nation of Chriſtians was known in the world, the chiefe
cauſe I take to be, that which Aeneas Sylvius gave, why more maintained
the Pope to be above the Councel, then the Councel above the
Pope, becauſe Popes gave Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks, &c. but
the Councels ſued in forma pauperis, and therefore could ſcarſe get
an Advocate to plead their cauſe: the fates of our Church having of
late devolved the government thereof into the hands of men tainted
with this poyſon, Arminianiſme became backed, with the powerfull
Arguments, of praiſe and preferment, and quickly prevailed, to beat
poore naked truth into a corner: It is high time then for all the lovers
of the old way, to oppoſe this innovation, prevailing by ſuch unworthy
means, before our breach grow great like the Sea, and there
be none to heale it.
My intention in this weake indeavour, (which is but the undigeſted
iſſue of a few broken houres, too many cauſes in theſe furious malignant
dayes, continually interrupting the courſe of my ſtudies) is
but to ſtirre up ſuch, who having more leaſure, and greater abilities,
will not as yet move a finger, to help vindicate oppreſſed Truth.
In the meane time I hope this diſcovery may not be unuſefull, eſpecially
to ſuch who wanting either, will or abilities, to peruſe larger
diſcourſes, may yet be allured by their words which are ſmoother then
oyle, to taſt the poyſon of Aſpes that is under their lips: Satan hath

〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
, depths where to hide, and methods how to broach

his lies: and never did any of his Emiſſaries employ his received talents
with more skill and diligence, then our Arminians: labouring
earneſtly in the firſt place to in ſtill ſome errors that are moſt plauſible,
intending chiefly an introduction of them that are more palpable,
knowing that if thoſe be for a time ſuppreſſed, untill theſe be well digeſted,
they will follow of their owne accord: wherefore I have endeavoured,
to lay open to the view of all, ſome of their foundation errors,
not uſually diſcuſſed, on which the whole inconſiſtent ſuperſtructure is
erected, whereby it will appeare, how under a moſt 
••
ine pretence of
furthering Piety, they have prevaricated againſt the very grounds of
Chriſtianitie: wherein
Firſt, I have not obſerved the ſame method in handling each particular
Controverſie, but followed ſuch ſeverall waies as ſeemed moſt
convenient to cleere the truth and diſcover their hereſies:
Secondly ſome of their errors I have not touched at all, as thoſe
concerning univerſall grace, juſtification, the finall Apoſtacy of true
beleevers: becauſe they came not within the compaſſe of my propoſed
method, as you may ſee Chap. 1. where you have the ſumme of the
whole diſcourſe.
Thirdly, I have given ſome inſtances, of their oppoſing the received
Doctrine of the Church of England, contained in divers of the
39. Articles: which would it did not yeeld us iuſt cauſe of further complaint,
againſt the iniquitie of thoſe times whereinto we were lately
fallen: Had a poor Puritan offended againſt halfe ſo many Canons, as
they oppoſed Articles, he had forfeited his livelihood, if not endangered
his life: I would I could heare any other probable reaſon, why divers
Prelates were ſo zealous for the diſcipline, and ſo negligent of the Doctrine
of the Church: but becauſe the one was reformed by the word
of God: the other remaining as we found it in the times of Popery.
Fourthly, I have not purpoſely undertaken to anſwer any of their
Arguments, referring that labour to a further deſigne: even a
clearing of our Doctrine of reprobation, and of the adminiſtration
of Gods providence, towards the Reprobates and over all their
actions, from thoſe calumnious aſperſions they caſt upon it, but concerning
this, I feare the diſcouragements of theſe wofull dayes, will
leave me nothing but a deſire: that ſo neceſſary a worke, may finde a
more able Pen:
IOHN OVVEN.
