TO THE GROVVING GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN, The hopes of our Crown, and the crown of our Hopes Prince Charles, At his Court in Caesaria, by vulgar contraction called IERSEY.

SIR,


I Present your Highnes with the Life of your Royal Oncle of France, A successfull and triumphant King both at home and abroad throughout the whole course of his Raign, and that, in so constant a degree, as if Fortune herself had bin his Companion, and Victory, his Handmayd: They attended

Him o're the Alps; They usher'd Him o're the Pyreneys; They were his Harbingers o're the Rhine, and they brought his horses to drink of the Danube; They were his Pilots at Sea, and they fill'd his sayles upon the Ocean, where he was incomparably more powerfull then all his Progenitors.
Nor would I adventure to expose thus to the present world, and transmit to future Ages the Raign of a For▪ rein King, had not I bin Spectator of divers of his exploits (and had occasion also to make my addresse to his Cardinal;) for the rest, I have labour'd to gather as faithfull instructions and authentic notes as I could, and those not upon loose trust or from light persons; The Relations, which are the ingredients of this Story, were not taken at the Porters lodge, but above staires, and most of them from the Counsell Table, and Courts of Parliament.
This Victorious King began to bear Arms and wear buff, about the same yeers that your Highnes did, for before he was thirteen, He suppress'd in person two Insurrections in Poitou, and Britany▪
 He quell'd divers more, which at last turn'd to his advantage, as we find great trees growing towards their full consistence, corroborat and take firmer rooting being shaken with tempests, by the resistance they make: So by debelling so many civill commotions he came to finde his own strength the more, and to be fear'd as well as belov'd of his Subjects, and a mixture of these two passions make an excellent government; For though the strongest Cittadel of a King be his Peoples love, and their hearts his best Exchequer, yet it is observ'd, that Love without Feare commonly turns to Scorn, and Fear without Love turns into Hatred. In the perusall of this Royal Story, if Your Highnes please to observe the circumstances and grounds of some intestin broyles, You shall find that divers of them have a neer analogie with these of England, for many

grew from discontents, that the great Convention of the three Estates was discontinued, and that France adhaer'd to Spanish Counsels, with other resemblances besides; Of these and other kind of commotions there happen'd above ten in this Kings Raign: Nor is it any news to hear that France, hath such fits of distemper, or indeed any Countrey else, that labours with superfluous humors, I mean that swels with exces of people and plentie; for as the Natural body when it is too repleat must have some vent, just so, the Political, must have some Evacuations at home or abroad when it is too full, and t'will thrive the better upon't afterward. If we cast our eyes upon the great world we shall find restlesse motions, reluctations and combatings between the Elements; yet we cannot call this any incongruitie or disorder in the frame of things, but it tends to the conservation of the whole, and may be said to keep Nature herself in action and health; That the Earth trembleth, the Sea tumbleth, that the Aire is alwayes in agitation, that 'tis rent with thunder, coruscations, and other Meteorological impressions; that all the Elements are in an incessant feud, it is for the Vniversal good, and to keep things vigorous, and fresh; So in Man who is the microcosm, the little world, and made up of elements, there be passions and humors which are in perpetuall reluctance within him, and so break out into tumults, preliations, and war; And where this war is well grounded, 'tis wholsom, and the victories that are acquir'd thereby, are Decreta Caeli, the Decrees of Heaven, but in an ill grounded war they are no other then Faelicia Scelera, fortunat villanies: Moreover, to transcend the Elements, if we mark the course of the heavenly bodies themselfs, there are crosse motions amongst them, they are in perpetuall revolutions and circumgyrations, nay, there are branlings and trepidations amongst them, (which yet the wisest of Philosophers held to be no

other then an harmonious sound, and sweet regular symphony,) And as the gran Vnivers runs thus alwayes round, and carryeth all bodies after it; So Man, who is part or rather the Epitome thereof, specially in reference to his actions, may be said to dance in a circle; For there is not any thing now acted, but may be parallell'd, and exemplified by some Age or other. Therefore among other excellent fruits of Story this is none of the least, to put one off, from wondring at any thing, because he meets with precedents and patterns of all sorts in former times; He that wil observe how some of the great Roman Emperors were content to live in Capreae (a petty Island) how the Princes of Italy fled to the Lakes of Venice for safetie, how some of our Kings to the Isle of Man, how Charles the seventh had no other town to keep his Court in but Bourges in Berry, one of the smallest Provinces in all France, which made him call'd a good while King of Berry; with a world of such examples, will nothing wonder that your Highnes keeps his Court now at Iersey. Nor is this present Story a plain down-right confus'd narration of things, for to compile such a work, is as easie as to make fagots, or to trusse up a bundle of straw; but (besides other observations and excursions) that which the Author chiefly aymes at, is to make the method of providence in dispensing judgements, and to make a research of the causes of them de longue main, for they seldom come immediatly one upon another, but many yeers, and sometimes a whole age intervenes between the judgement and the cause.
Furthermore, I have bin carefull in this Story to vindicat England touching the circumstance of some traverses of State and War, twixt Her and France, during this Kings Raign, which are misreported by the French Chroniclers: there will be other censures found here besides, but this I have done as he that kill'd the Serpent upon the childs head without touching his body.


It remains, that I implore your Highne's pardon not for the subject of this work, because 'tis rich and royal, but for the forme thereof, if it be not found adaequat to the height of the matter, according to the desires and endeavours of
Your Highne's most obedient most loyal and most humble servant▪
From the prison of the Fleet this Midsommer day 1646.

HOVVELL.
