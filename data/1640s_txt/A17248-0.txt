TO HIS MVCH HONOVRED Father in Law, William Purefey of Calldecoate in Warwkickshire, ESQUIRE.

SIR,


THat I am yours, both you deserve it, and I publish it, and therefore for what is mine, whilest I have you for my Father, my thoughts shall not rove to seeke any other Patron, next under God, who, if hee have made mee an Instrument of any good upon so good a subject, I wish he may have the glory, and I the prayers of all that taste it.
Sir, I have heard you with serious desires, sometimes wish, that some would undertake the rendring of the Bible throughout, in an

easie Paraphrase, after this manner. And might your wishes have effect, doubtlesse, it would prove a usefull worke, and serviceable to God, and to his Church; yea, (if my judgement faile me not) in the next place to the translation of the Scripture into our mother tongue; whereunto the Lord stirre up the hearts of those whom hee hath designed for so happy an imployment as is the holding forth of so great light, and facilitating of Scripture studies, to the filling of theHab. 2. 14. earth with knowledge, as waters cover the Sea.


Your ever obliged Sonne in Law,
GEORGE ABBOTT.
