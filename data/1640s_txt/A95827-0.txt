To my Ingenuous
Friend, R. W.

WHen we are dead, and now, no more
Our harmles mirth, our wit, and ſcore
Diſtracts the Towne; when all is ſpent
That the baſe niggard world hath lent
Thy purſe, or mine; when the loath'd noiſe
Of Drawers, Prentiſes, and boyes


Hath left us, and the clam'rous barre
Items no pints i'th' Moone, or Starre;
When no calme whiſp'rers wait the doores,
To fright us with forgotten ſcores;
And ſuch aged, long bils carry,
As might ſtart an Antiquary;
When the ſad tumults of the Maze,
Arreſts, ſuites, and the dreadfull face
Of Seargeants are not ſeene, and wee
No Lawyers Ruffes, or Gownes muſt fee:
When all theſe Mulcts are paid, and I
From thee, deare wit, muſt part, and dye;
Wee'le beg the world would be ſo kinde,
To give's one grave, as wee'de one minde;


There (as the wiſer few ſuſpect,
That ſpirits after death affect)
Our ſoules ſhall meet, and thence will they
(Freed from the tyranny of clay)
With equall wings, and ancient love
Into the Elyſian fields remove,
Where in thoſe bleſſed walkes they'le find,
More of thy Genius, and my mind:
Firſt, in the ſhade of his owne bayes,
Great BEN they'le ſee, whoſe ſacred Layes,
The learned Ghoſts admire, and throng,
To catch the ſubject of his Song.
Then Randolph in thoſe holy Meades,
His Looers, and Amyntas reads,


Whilſt his Nightingall cloſe by,
Sings his, and her owne Elegie;
From thence diſmiſs'd by ſubtill roades,
Through airie paths, and ſad aboads;
They'le come into the drowſie fields
Of Lethe, which ſuch vertue yeelds,
That (if what Poets ſing be true)
The ſtreames all ſorrow can ſubdue.
Here on a ſilent, ſhady greene;
The ſoules of Lovers oft are ſeene,
Who in their lifes unhappy ſpace,
Were murther'd by ſome perjur'd face.
All theſe th'inchanted ſtreames frequent,
To drowne their Cares, and diſcontent,


That th'inconſtant, cruell ſex
Might not in death their ſpirits vex:
And here our ſoules bigge with delight
Of their new ſtate will ceaſe their flight:
And now the laſt thoughts will appeare,
They'le have of us, or any here;
But on thoſe flowry banks will ſtay,
And drinke all ſenſe, and cares away.
So they that did of theſe diſcuſſe,
Shall find their fables true in us.
