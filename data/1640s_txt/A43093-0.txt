To the Honorable Sir Anthony Weldon Knight, and the reſt of the Honble Deputy Lievtenants and Comittees of the County of Kent.


Honourable Gentlemen,


THE noble favours I daily receive from you, ſince my arrivall out of Ireland, into this County, hath imboldned me to offer this poor tribute of mine experience, not to teach your uncontrollable knowledges, but humbly deſire it may kiſſe your hands, as a ſacrifice offered from your ſervant, or as a weakneſſe that ſtands in need of your protections. In your Honours I know is power to judge of my labour, and in you alſo is power to exerciſe mercy; I hope I have written nothing that is erring from ſence or truth: having not laboured mine own, but the profit of my poore bleeding, dying Country-men, whom theſe miſerable times have called out to this miſerable unnaturall War: deſiring not only his temporall victory, (but above al) his ſpirituall. There may be many puny Scholars that from theſe briefe Rules, may gather more abler judgements: Your noble favours and allowance can only make it acceptable to thoſe which need it, eſpecially in this Country, which I wiſh to be ſerved by it: then let thoſe graces fly from your noble natures, that as now I live, I may die your Honours poore

Servant and Soldier L. H.
