TO THE
CHRISTIAN
READER.

READER,


THe Church even
in her Infancy,
the Christian
Church was under
the Crosse, Stephanus
lapidatus, Jacobus trucidatus,
saith Austin, Stephen
was stoned, and James

beheaded. The Church hath
had two kinde of persecutions,
When any common calamity befell the people or State, as famine, dearth, pestilence, they straightway imputed it to the Christians, saying, that they and their wicked religion were the cause thereof. Christianos ad Leonem. Tertul. Away with them to the Lion, to the stake. one from Rome ethnicall,

what a continuall storme
arose against Christians,
which lasted three hundred
years under the ten monsters
of men those bloudie
Emperours, Nero, Domitian,
Trajane, Antoninus,
Severus, Maximinus,
Decius, Valerianus,
Aurelianus, Dioclesianus,
whose rage was such
as a man could not set his
foot in Rome, but tread
on the graves of Martyrs▪

the first grand persecution,
wherein Saint Peter (as it
is said) and Saint Paul
were martyred at Rome,
with others innumerable,
and Jacobus Iustus at Jerusalem,
whence Tertullian
inferred, That the
Gospel must needs be a precious
thing, because
Nero hated it.

Dioclesian raised the
tenth and extreamest persecutionVide Euseb. lib. 8., wherein Churches
were overthrown, Bibles

burnt, whole Cities razed,
women hanged upon
trees naked with their heads
downwards. The Christians
yet in that time under
the Heathen Emperours had
many lucida intervalla,
many breathing spaces under
Princes not altogether
so bloudy. But the Popes
have persecuted the Protestants
for six hundred years
together, and that without
any intermission.
I might exemplifie in many
of their cruell practices▪

1. In their wars against
the Waldenses and Albigenses.



2. In the Massacre of
France, in which the rivers
were died with bloud.
3. In our tempora Mariana
Queen Maries daies;
Who hath not heard of bloudy
Bonner and Gardiner?

4. In the rebellious insurrection
in Ireland, and
the cruell butchery of above
200 thousand Protestants
there. Platina writes of
seventeen thousand martyred
by Dioclesian; but Meterane
writes of 50 thousand
slaughtered by the Pope
only in the Low-countries,

Christians.

Antichrist is drunk
with the bloud of the
Saints, Revel. 17. 6. and
18. 24. In her, that is,
Babylon, now Rome, was
found the bloud of Prophets,
that is, of all those
that preacht the Word of
God, and of Saints, and
of all that were slain upon
the earth; They were put
to death by the authority of
the Pope. Some hold that

the bitterest persecutions of
the Church of God are yet to
come, but two considerations
may much support
the spirits of Gods people.
1. The shortnesse of the
Persecutours lives, and their
miserable ends for the most
part.
2. The good that comes
to the Church of God by
affiction and persecution.
I will not speak of the short
lives of many Popes, and
the short reign of Queen
Mary
Of all since the conquest her reign was the shortest, only excepting that of Richard the tyrant, but much more bloudy then was his. Speeds Chro. in Q. Marie.
, nor of the miserable
end of many persecuting
Emperours, but shall out of

Foxes Martyrology, instance
in the exemplary punishments
of some of the persecutours
of our Martyrs.
George Eagles (alias,
Foxes Acts and Monum. 3d vol. pag. 1023.
Trudge over the world)
hid himself in a Corn-field,
and by the benefit of the
height of the Corn, and
breadth of the field he had
escaped, had not Ralph
Lurdane one of his persecutours
with more malicious
craft, climbed a high
tree to view over the place,
and so descried him.
This persecutour a lewd
fellow of life for theft and
whoredome, within a few

years after he had apprehended
the foresaid George
Eagles for gain of money,
he himself was attached of
felony for stealing a horse,
condemned and hanged in the
same place and Town of
Chelmesford, where
George Eagles before
suffered martyrdome. A
Bishop coming to Stephen
Gardiner (Bishop of Winchester)
on his death-bed,
put him in remembrance of
Peters denying his Master;

Foxes 3d vol. p. 95.
he answering again:
said, That he had denied
with Peter, but never repented
with Peter, and

so both stinkingly and
unrepentantly died.
See also in Fox a notable story of the death of Dr
Whittington a persecutour. Doctour
Storie was a great enemy
to the Protestants in
Queen Maries daies, but
in Queen Elizabeths reign
he being beyond sea was by a
handsome wile brought over
into England,

Fox ubi supra and suffered
as a Traitour, on whom
the boyes sung these verses,
D. Story for You I am sorrie,

The hangman must have
Your gown:
Your father the Pope,
could not save You
from the rope;
For all his triple crown.


Secondly, The people of
God like Commomile, the
more they were trod on the
more they did spread, and
(like Rabbets in frosty weather)
did thrive under persecution.
One
Mr
 Manton on Rev. 2. 3. saith,
Martyrologie and catechizing
were the great
engines by which the reformers
battered down
Poperie. Jerome compares
the state of the Ch
•
rch
under Constantine and
some Christian Emperours
with that under Dioclesian
and some persecuting Emperours:
under the former the
Church increased much Potentia

& divitiis, in power
and wealth, but diminished
virtutibus, in vertue▪
How strangely was that promise
accomplished in England
and France,
Mat. 25.
Whosoever
will save his life
shall lose it; and whosoever
will lose his life for
my sake, shall finde it.


William Wolsey Martyr
being in prison sent by another
a noble to Richard
Denton with this commendation,
That he marvelled
he tarried so long
behinde him, seeing he
was the first that delivered
him the book of Scripture

into his hand, and
told him that it was the
truth, desiring him to
make haste after as fast as
he could.

Foxes Acts and Monum. 3d vol. p. 433 This money
and message being delivered
to Denton almost a year
after Wolsey was burned,
his answer was this. I confesse
it is true, but alas I
cannot burn. But he that
would not burn in the cause
of Christ, was afterward
burned against his will; for
his house was set on fire, and
while he went in to save his
goods he lost his life. On
the contrary, some that were
in prison, and purposed to

suffer for the truth, were

 one hath, As good
husbands do not put al their
corn to the oven, but save
some for seed, so doth God
ever in the worst of persecutions.
When Henry the fourth
of France had conquered
his enemies, he turned Papist,
and gave this reason of
it, That he might settle
himself in peace and safety.
Ravilliak who slew
him, confessed that the reason
why he stabbed him, was,

because he was of two religions.
It is well noted by a
Reverend DivineDr
Gouge on Exod. 13. 13., That
the book of martyrs was
in high esteem all the
days of Queen Elizabeth:
All Churches by authority
were injoyned to have it, so
as all that would might read
it. There was scarce a family
of note that had it not,
it was usuall to spend the
long winter evenings in reading
it. By the constancy
of Martyrs therein set out,
people were much encouraged
to stand to that faith
which was sealed by their
bloud. Whether the killing

of the two Witnesses be near
at hand or no, I determine
not, but sure there is likelihood
enough of troubles and
persecutions to Gods people,
therefore I conceive these
severall Tracts, Of the
Martyrs in generall, and
Concerning our English
Martyrs, Of Martin
Luther a couragious Reformer,
Of the Covenant
and Promises, Of
living and dying by faith
may be very suitable to our
times.
But some may urge,
that for the first subject
concerning the Martyrs,

there was a book long
since published, stiled,
The Mirrour of Martyrs,
usefull that way. I
deny not but that book
might be profitable to divers
Christians, who either
wanted money to purchase
or leasure to reade
the large book of Martyrs:
But my drift in this
worke is to excerp onely
(among the many dicta facta
of the Martyrs) those
speeches and acts of theirs,
which were specially observable.
Master Co

ton
(who composed the book before
mentioned) hath confusedly

jumbled divers things
together: some of which are
ordinary, though others may
be remarkable, and I believe
he mistakes in that which he
hath of Voes, it being not
consonant to the originall
whence he took it. He hath also
the same thing twice of
Iohn & Christopher Waid.
I hope therefore (though I
have many things the same
with Cotton, that this work
will be of speciall use to those,
who would not be ignorant of
the living speeches of dying
Christians. The Saints are best
toward their end; so it was
with Jacob and Moses,

as appears in his excellent

his death,Deut. 32. so David,
Solomon, what an excellent
Sermon and praier
did our Saviour make a
little before his death.John 14. 15. 16. and 17. chap. I
have likewise long since
put forth a Treatise of
the Covenant and Promises,
yet having collected
divers new Observations
of that excellent subject,
(for some of which I was beholding
to two of our worthy
LecturersMr
Marshall and Mr
Strong.
 at Westminster)
I thought good to adde
this Tract to the rest, it
being of speciall use alwaies

for Christians, especially
in evil times. Thus
hoping God will blesse these
my endeavours for the good
of his people, I rest
