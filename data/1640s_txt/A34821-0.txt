To the truly worthy, and VVorshipfull, Mr. I. S. of P. Esquire.

Honoured Sir,

IT is not the worthinesse of the Worke, nor Workeman, can whisper any confidence of your acceptance of this trifle; but only the seasonablenesse and truth of the subject (of which you are more then an eyewitnesse) gives it boldnesse to kisse your hand. This Poem was calculated only for the Meridian of some private friends, not daring to gaze in the face of the World, because it's neer kin to truth, and therefore to danger. Nor did the Author desire so to strumpet his Muse, as to prostitute her to the imbraces of every one, being not ambitious of the airy title of a Poet. Neither let it present it selfe to your eye the lesse worthy, because now martyr'd by the Presse, though it be become now so adulterated with false and scandalous Pamphlets, that it is a dishonour for a legitimate phantasie to derive a title from thence. My humble request to your Worship is, that you will vouchsafe to inrich

these lines with your view, and pardon the forward ambition of him, whose glory is to be known of you, at the becoming distance of

Your Worships most humble Honourer,
