To the Reverend Divines of the Presbyteriall way.

Brethren,


THeſe are the ſig hings of ſome of your own ſpirits under Epiſcopacy, under the Tyranny of that government. O how acute and ſenſible were your Iudgements and Conſciences then of the uſurpation, dominion, impoſed Formes, when you were the ſufferers! but now that your Brethren are become the Non-conformiſts to you, as you were Non conformists to the Prelates; and you the impoſers, and your Brethren the ſufferers; I find times and conditions are forgotten, and yoakes are called for which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare. I ſee by your printings and preachings the working of new diſpoſitions in you, and Symptomes of ſomething like Dominion and Perſecution; ſurely Brethren your crying out thus for the civill power to help you or all is undon, is a ſign you trust not to the Goſpel ſtrength, nor truth of you
•
 way, but to the arme of fleſh. Methinks of late your Sun is turning into darkneſſe and blackneſſe over us, and your Moon into bloud: is it poſsible that yoakes, burthens, whips, priſons, baniſhments, can be ſoon forgotten? Can Saints like naturall men ſee their faces in a glaſſe, and ſo ſoon forget what manner of men they were?


I have reaſoned with you in your own arguments; I hope your own arguments may find acceſſe to your ſpirits when ours cannot; men are ſooner perſwaded by their own reaſon then anothers. O that the ſame ſounding of bowels may be heard in you to your Brethren, that ye wiſhed to heare in others who were once your task-maſters! What Joſeph ſaid in his affliction, we ſhall ſay to you, Think on us I pray you when it ſh
•
ll be well with you, and ſhew kindneſſe; for it may be as Mordecai ſaid, ye are come to the Kingdom for ſuch a time as this; if not, enlargement and deliverance ſhall ariſe from another place.


IOHN SALTMARSH.
