TO HIS HIGHNESSE The Prince Elector Palatine.

May it please your Highnesse,


I Should not thus have presented my diversions, where I owe my study and business, but that where all is due, a man may not justly withhold any part.
This following Discourse was composed some years since at my spare howers in the Vniversity. The subject of it is mixed Mathematicks which I did the rather at such times make choice of, as being for the pleasure of it, more proper for recreation, and for the facility more sutable to my abilities and leisure.
I should not Sir, have been ambitious of any so Great (I could not of any Better
â–ª) Patronage, had not my relation both engaged and emboldned me to this Dedication.
They that know your Highnesse how great an encourager you are, and how able



a Iudge in all kind of ingenuous arts and literature, must needs acknowledge your pressures and low condition, to be none of the least mischiefs (amongst those many other) under which the Common-wealth of learning does now suffer.
It would in many respects much conduce to the generall advancement of religion and learning, if the reformed Churches in whose cause and defence your family hath so deeply suffered, were but effectually mindfull of their engagements to it. And particularly, if these present unhappy differences of this Nation did not occasion too much forgetfulnesse of their former zeal and professions for the vindicating of your family, and the restoring of your Highnesse; the hastning and accomplishment of which, together with the increase of all heavenly blessings upon your Highnesse, shall be the hearty dayly prayer of

Your Highnesse most humble and most devoted servant and Chaplain, JOHN WILKINS.
