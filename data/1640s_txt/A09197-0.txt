Worthy Sir,


WHen I had ended this Discourse, & bethought my selfe of a Subject, who for h

I rather set before such, that true paterne and mirror of Magnificence, (so highly honoured and admired, even untill this day, for so many wayes deserving of his Countrie) Cosmo de Medicis, of whom the Florentine Historie thus reporteth. This Cosmo (saith he) was the most esteemed and the most famous Citizen of Florence, (being no man of warre) either in

Florence or any other City, because he did not

s, but also in wisedome, for among other qualities that advanced him no be chiefe in his Country, he more then other men liberall and magnificent, which liberality appeared much more after his death then before, and though he did Princely things, yet in his conversation, riding abroad, or marrying of his children or kinsfolkes, hee was like unto all other men, modest and discreet, because he well knew that extraordinary things, which are of all men with admiration beheld, doe procure more envy then those which without ostentation are honestly covered; surely private men have equalled many Prince in Magnificence, I might alledge many examples for this purpose. But I onely shew how much we are first obliged to God, then to all those who study to provide for the safety of their King and Country, the advancement of Gods Church and true Religion, of which number (Sir,) as you are one so eminent, here on earth, so may you receive your reward with the number of



those, whose piety and deeds of mercy, shall receive their reward in another Kingdome.

Yours in all observance to be commanded, H. P.
