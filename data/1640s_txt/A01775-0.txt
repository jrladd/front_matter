To the true Example of Heroicke Vertue, and Favourer of Arts, Sir FREDERICK CORNWALLIS.
SIR:

YOu are so well acquainted with the Iustice of Nobility, that your owne Fame is your owne History: you are writ in that Sir. Nor need I study to expresse it in a larger Character, since it is texted already in a Volume, time (which is Edaxrerum) cannot exterminate. Thinke not, worthiest Sir, this can in me be flattery; your worth admits none: nor dare I sell my selfe to such a slavery, as to beginne my

service to You with that unmanly prostitution: You have alwayes affoorded me such transcendent favours, that I should descend to ingratitude, should not I study a retribution: which though I cannot reach at, accept Sir, I beseech you, this Essay of gratitude from


Your most obliged honourer, Hen: Glapthorne.
