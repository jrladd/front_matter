To the much Honoured, and thrice Noble Lord, Robert, Earle of Warwick, Baron of Lees, &c.

Right Honourable;

HAving presented the first part of my endeavours of this nature to an honourable Peer, and finding his noble acceptance with respect in the world, above the desert of the Authur, or merit of the work, which with some other encouragements made me bold to tender this second Part, as a free-will offering (in love) to your Lordship: being ambitious that it should beare the name of so truly a noble Patron (honour ed of all) who have beene and still is such a great pillar to uphold this tottering State, whose gallant, faithfull, and successfull service, will render you famous to all posterity.


I confesse the humble wing of my Muse lights upon a low-borne Subject, yet modestly possest with fury, in the midst of temptations, keeps her Virgin beauty; although she hath to doc with the workes of darknesse, (ripened with the corruption of these times) yet your Lordship may justly judge it too light for your serious meditations. However I doubt not but it may prevaile in the intermission of 
〈◊〉
 employments, so as to invite a favourable looks from your Honour, which will preserve it from the 
〈◊〉
 of envy.
I am not so soobe-hardy, as to plead the worth of my Muse, whereby to match her to the mits of the time; (nor will she think her self preferred by it, unlesse they be wisely honest as well as 
〈◊〉
) but her true intention free from flatterie, trimmed in a plaine dresse, only somwhat of a strange new fashion: yet so, as the fancies may be pleasing to some, the discoveries, usefull to others, and the moralls profitable to all, who will consider them.
All which I leave to your Lordships protection, and you, to him that will never leave you, till he hath given you the complement of all 
〈◊〉
. So prayes he that desires to subscribe himselfe,

The humblest of your honours Servants, Humphrey Mill.
