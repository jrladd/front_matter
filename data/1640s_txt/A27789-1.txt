of Peers in Parliament.

A double Epigram.

esse clears againe,
As a spring his muddie stain.
Lo, his countenance confutes
All these vile and vulgar bruits,
Scattering mists where he doth bow
That bright splendour of his brow,
Fret Errinnys, break thy gall,
Till it drown thee, spleen and all:
I must tell his trust abroad,
In this well deserved Ode,

One more true then he hath been.


My Lord and loadstone of my heart and more,
I felt none mortall pull so strong before,
Oh let me still finde favour in those eyes
That scatter clouds; and where bright Sun-beams rise.
To the tribunall of so milde a look
I will adventure this Oracular book,
The which elsewhere I have presented twice,
And at the third time shall not bate the price.
I care not, I, although I hear men say,
Your Psalms are censur'd for Apocrypha:
I ask no more, but when you next consult,
You please to let them sing Quicunque vult.

My last ambition is but to present
Great gratulation to the Parliament;
And till this promis'd panegyrick come,
I leave this begg'ring poetry strook dumb.
Reader vouchsafe to see, and looke, and taste a
sup of Hymns, and creamy afterings, made up in
the last sheet of all the book, with directions given
to make all even, if the Reader also please to
see the titles and the prefaces.
