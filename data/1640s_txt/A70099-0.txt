To the Right Honorable, Algernon Earl of Northumberland, Lord Percy, Lucy, Poynings, Fitzpain, Brian, and Latimer; Lord high Admirall of ENGLAND, Knight of the moſt Noble order of the Garter, and one of His Majeſties moſt Honorable Privy-councell.

Right Honorable,

THe unworthy oppreſſed Author hath not long ſince groaned under the ſevere cenſure of the late high Commiſsion for the inſuing ſpeculations, which now he adventures to preſent unto your Honour, hoping for a candid acceptance, and interpretation of his poor indeavours for the good of Zion. Had not the riſing Sun of an auſpicious Parliament diſpelled thoſe clouds of oppreſion and tyranny, that menaced a drowning both to me and

them, they had been choked in their embrio, and never injoyed the happineſſe they have now attained in your Honorable aſpect. Pardon (moſt noble Lord) the inforced preſumption of the diſtreſſed Author, which implores and hopes for your honorable Patronage, and humbly praying for the daily increaſe of your Honours health and eternall happineſſe, remains

Your Honours moſt humble, moſt devoted Servant, William Fenwick.
