Adam Lawrence: Leonard Lawrence wisheth increase
of happinesse, with the Yeares
of Nestor.

Sir,


WHen first I Translated this small
Treatise of Arnalte and Lucenda,
I was Resolv'd to have tender'd it
to Your Honour'd view, fairely
written in a well-pen'd Manuscript:
but since that time my Resolutions
are alter'd, yet not somuch through
my owne desires, as by the perswasion of some well-wishing
friends; who earnest to have some Copies of
(I must confesse) these my weake Endeavours, encouraged
me to send it to the Presse, thereby to avoyde
the tediousnesse of writing: To these their motions
I was easily perswaded, and that the rather, 'cause
my Subject had formerly beene a Printed Object:
(though in another tongue) Yet I protest no vaine ambition,
no phantastique desire, to be perspicuous to
the transparent eye of the world incited me, but onely
the importunity of friends: this I hope will excuse
my forwardnesse, either to Your worthy selfe, or any
indifferent Reader; the ingenious I am sure will incourage
my resolutions; and as for the Hidra-headed

multitude, let them spit the venome of their malicious
Envy, and spare not; for I have already prevented the
operation of their poyson, with an Antidote of sufficient
worth, which is, my neglect of such Criticall
dispositions: and if this be not sufficient, why the two
Capitall Letters of Your ever-honour'd name, is of
force enough to confound them with amazement. For
which reason, I knowing it to be customary to such as
write Bookes, to Dedicate their Labours to some one
or other; some tendring their Workes to the view of
Grand-Personages, (I will not say in hope of reward)
others to their speciall friends, (perhaps in respect
of love and familiarity) yet both (I am confident (with
intent, that they may be set forth to the perspicuous
eye of the world; have chose Your most respected
Selfe, to Patronize my post-ensuing Lines;
not knowing any so worthy, or more judicious,
or to whom I am more oblieg'd. Or have I dar'd
to tender them to the acceptance of any other, sith
they are Yours, and You may justly claime them,
I having Devoted all my Services to Your Candid
selfe. These if You daigne to protect, I'le not
care for Carping Momus, or Barking Zoylus,
though they should taxe me with a Westminsterian
Epitaph: albeit I confesse I was never such a pretender
to Learning (though I know not much)
as to steale whole Verses, though it bee lawfull
to Quacke-salve Lame Lines with helping words,
and two Physitians use one and the selfe-same
Simples (though differently Compounded) but
to write Verbatim, I'de not affront any mans ingenium,
so ignobly, or dishonour my selfe so basely,
though thousands know it not: one may come

with Virgils Verse in his mouth, and say,

Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.

But's no matter, such Censurers may use their freedom,
I will not say of ignorance or envy, if
of either I care not: It's Your Honour'd selfe,
whom I observe: so you be pleased, it imports not
who's offended.
My Genius having prompt me to present these
unpolisht Lines to Your judicious Censure; I shall
intreate You'ld pardon the faults my English Stile
affords; and attribute them to my unskilfulnesse;
I must confesse (and believe) there bee many, yet
since more sublimer Wits have had some, mine
may bee the more excusable; for if the finest
Lawne have an Iron-mould, (witnesse Your selfe)
it may bee borne withall in a courser piece.
But what neede I direct the freenesse of Your
Noble Disposition, or the generosity of your super-excellent
minde, since the Transcendency of
Your judgement, manifests that you'le have this
consideration; that a small haire cannot give so great
a shadow as a bigge Cable, nor a Needles poynt,
so large a circumference as a wide Circle. I neede
not unfold th'aenigma of my meaning, Car, au, bon entendeur
ne fault que demy parolle. As Painters draw
a Counter-Figies by a living Object; so have I
enterpriz'd to translate a Booke, being a Printed
Subject; yet if I give not a true resemblance, or
lay my shadowes right, representing th'Idea of
my Prose, though Metamorphis'd into Verse, impute
it to my want of Art, not of Desire:
Thus, if you please to protect these my imployments,
which kept my Wits busie for some spare houres, from

the taxations of false-opinionate men, whose Criticall
Censures I may compare to Paris Darts, or Cephalus
Shafts, which transpierce the best Armour of proofe,
though of Vulcans owne forging. I'le promise, when as
I am growne more cunning, and can mixe my colours
better, to Present You with some more serious Piece:
In the interim I, tendring these to Your protection, recommend
You to the tuition of the Vniversall Rector,
who Felicitate all Your Enterprizes; whilst I, with all
respect, and submissive Reverence, humbly kisse Your
hands, and remaine in hope of the continuance of Your
Favours,

Your well-wishing, and most
affectionate Nephew:
Leonard Lawrence.
