le Lady, and my worthy Mother;



THERE are two chiefe reasons why I dedicated this Trea
•
ise of the Promises unto your Ladyship First the excellency of the subject, with which I know you are much affected, 
〈◊〉
 My neare relation and engagement unto your Self. I deemed

none fit to patronize such a work, but some noble Theophilus, or Elect Lady; and to have sought a remoter Friend having one so neere and proper, might have bin construed folly. I wish the Booke may give content unto your Selfe, and others of Gods people, and then I doubt not, but the dedication of it unto a Christian, and such 
As Paula & Marcella were to Ierome, so is your Ladyship to those iudicious persons, which resort unto you, a great Questionist, & they to whom you propound your doubts do tam proficere quam prodesse, as well benefit by you, as benefit you.
 a Christian, will be approv'd. The knowledge of the Promises is necessary for Christians, who do, or ought to live by faith, and therfore this Treatise (I conceive) may be generally usefull unto them both for the right performance of holy duties, the exercise

of divine graces, and likewise to uphold the soule in all manner of distresses.
1 It will be very usefull for the right performance of any good duty.

 reading, meditation, conference, &c. then to call to mind Gods gracious promises which he hath made to assist us in those services, and to accept them rightly performed? but because I handle this point in the Treatise it self, mentioning the speciall promises made to particular duties, I will here proceed after another manner, and shew, how there are Promises

in Scripture for every Commandement.

Thus graciously doth God

deale with his people, he might out of his absolute soveraignty over us, command only, and we were bound then to obey; but he is pleased (the better to quicken us to obedience) to annex these gracious promises, to his righteous Commandements, and those that truly performe the duty which he commands, shall undoubtedly receive the mercy, which he promiseth.
Secondly, this Treatise of the Promises, may be useful (I suppose) for the quickning and exercising al holy graces. How doth the sound knowledge and frequent meditation of Gods sweet and precious Promises,

strengthen Faith, quicken hope, in flame zeal, confirm patience, and foster al the graces of Gods Spirit? When we stagger through unbelif, and are tempted to doubt of any thing, if we would have recourse to the promises, they would uphold us▪ as for example, if this cogitation should arise in me, certainly if I doe not as the world doth, I shall loose my credit, and never come to any wealth, or estate like others, by & by I should rem
•
mber what is written touching this matter, Sam. 3.
•
0. Mat. 6.33. and then consider the gen
•
rality 
•
nd certainty of these & other promises, and that would settle the soul.

Lastly, against all troubles 
•
nward, outward, painful, sinfull, of soul, body, good name, state, Faith in Gods promises is a soveraigne Antidote; this is my comfort in my affliction (sai
•
h David) thy word (that is, thy promise made unto me in thy Word) hath quickned me, Ps. 119.50. He telleth not what kind of trouble he was in; in any trouble whatsoever, he received singular comfort by meditation in the Promises: by Gods promises, adversity, sicknes, poverty & death of Friends are sweetned, we are upholden by them in time of temptation, and in the pangs of death, receive

consolation: Against all Evill that may assaile us, 3 thing
•
 there are that we may with joy behold in the promise; 1 Protection, 2 Restitution, 3 Deliverance. Doth the Lord permit us to temptation? his grace is sufficient to support us, 2 Cor. 12 9. doth he suffer us to be overcome in temptation? yet promiseth he restitution, by a new act of grace, raising us, and at length to set us out of the reach of all temptations. In the defects of good things, and the small measures therof, we may draw comfort likewise from the promises. God promiseth,

comfort from that thrice precious promise, Ps. 84.11. and those three heavenly conduits of sweetest consolation, Rom 8.18, 28, 32. and if one or a few verses afford so much comfort, what cordiall sweetnesse and refreshing may a Christian sucke, out of all those wells and brests of consolation and Salvation? Indeed the Faithfull can never want grounds of comfort. First GOD the Father is the GOD of all consolation,
