TO THE VERTVOVS CARINDA . MADAM , IT was your pleaſure not long ſince to admit me into your Ladyships preſence , where I took the boldness to begin a diſcourſe of the Planets , and to declare the power of them : which conference worser • worser ariſe from the death of Sir Thomas Wentworth , who departed this world in his Climacterical year . A friend of mine being at the place of execution , herd a pitiful Lady warble forth a mournful duty ; and as soon as her eyes beheld his head parted from his ſhoulders , ſhe uttered theſe words with tears in her eyes , ( Oh what wit , treason , harms ) which being examined , were the true letters of ( Six Thomas Wentworth ) without adding or taking away of a letter . Well might ſhe confidently affirm what ſhe ſaid , ſince none will deny , but that the cutting off the head spoils the wit . I have according to your Ladyships command , ſent you this dream of the Lord of Strafford , in regard formerly you have been pleaſed to lend and ear to my tedious relation ; the which is included within a ſmall treatiſe , styled , the Divine Dreamer , together with the ſervice Of your Servant GONZALO .
