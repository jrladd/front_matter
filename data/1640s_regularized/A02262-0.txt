TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTIE . SIR , I Am bold to preſent you with this Piece of the PASSION , the Original deſigned by the curious Pencil of Grotius : whoſe former afflictions seem to have taught him pliable passion , and art to rule the affections of others : clothing the ſaddeſt of Subject's in the suitable attire of Tragedy ; not without the Example of two ancient Father's of the Primitive Church , Apollinarius and Nazianzen . The Argument is of both the Teſtaments a pathetical Abſtract . Thoſe formidable Wonders , effected by God in his own Commonwealth ; thoſe ſtupendious Miracles , for truth a Pattern to all Hiſtory , for strangeness to all Fables ; here meet together to attend on CHRIST'S PASSION . The effects of his Power here ſweetly end in thoſe of his Mercy : and that terrible Lord of Hoſts , is now this meek God of Peace ; reconciling all to one another , and Mankind to Himself . Sr. in this change of Language I am no punctual Interpreter : a way as ſervill as ungraceful . Quintilian cenſures a Painter , that he more affected Similitude then Beauty ; who would have ſhown greater Skill , if less of Reſemblance : the ſame in Poetry is condemned by Horace ; of that Art the great Lawgiver . Thus in the Shadow of your Abſence , dismissed from Arms by and Act of Time , have I , in what I was able , continued to ſerve you . The humbleſt of your Majeſties Servants , GEORGE SANDYS .
