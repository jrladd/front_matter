To the growing Glory OF Great Brittaine , Prince CHARLES . A parallel betwixt His Highness , and the Black Prince . SIR , Wales had one Glorious Prince of hair and hue ( Which colour sticks unto Him still ) like You : He traveled far , He wone His spurs in France , And took the King , the KING , o monstrous chance Then His victorious troops afresh He getherss And with the grey Goosewing his shaftsnew feathers , He beats a march up the Pyrene Hills , And the Cantabrian climb with terro • fils , To reinthrone DONE Pedro Castile's King , Of which heroic Act all Stories ring . Your Royal Sire traveled so far , and They Of all our Princes only made that way . Who knows , Great Sir , but by just destiny , Your bunch of ( Youthful ) Plumes may further fly ? But Falcon-like , You may with full summed wing The Eagle cuff , and from his talons wring ThePalatinat . Prey , or in exchange seize on his Over , And fix Your Standard on the Indian shore . 'Twas byCarolus Magnus . • Charles , France once the Empire god , 'Twas by aCarol Quintus . Charles the Spaniard worser •• we that los , Why may not Brittaine challenge the next call , And by a CHARLES be made Imperial ? — Sic Vaticinatur . IA . HOWELL .
