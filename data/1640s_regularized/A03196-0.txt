TO THE HONOURABLE AND EMINENTLY VERTVOVS , THE EXcellent Lady THEOPHILA , the Learned Consort of the right worthy Sir ROBERT COOKE , Knight , etc. Excellent Madam , SHould I present you with your merited praise , What Muse should I invoke ? what rapture raise ? For my minerva , this too high a strain , As far surpassing both my pen and brain . When I shall say , the Lily does excel For whiteness , or the Violet for the smell ; Or for a modest blush , the Garden Rose ; What speak I more in this then each man knows ? Or if I shall proclaim the Turtle chaste ; Or praise the ripe fruits for their pleasing taste , The Nightingale commend for many a tune , And say she far excels the Bird of Iune . If in their grace I strive to do my best , What write I more , then is by all confessed ? If I shall say you're beautiful and fair , Matchless , unparalleled , in all parts rare ; And to those outward should I then annex The inward virtues , that most grace your Sex ! To name which , would exceed number , or to tell The several tongues , in which you so excel , Greek , Roman , French , Castillian , and with those , Tuscan , Teutonick , in all which you pose The foreign Linguist : in the most select Both native Ideom , and choice dalect . Or , for all learning Moral or Divine , To list you a tenth Muse among the nine ? When to the height of all these I am grown , I shall add nothing to you save your own . Nor can my praise the least advantage win you Since all that know you know these to be in you . If to your honours , both of Birth and Book , You shall but dame and animating look , To ' inlifen these dull papers ; they shall strive , Alternately to make your name survive . Acknowledging , in a submiss surrender They had died blind , not lightened by your splendour . Your Honours absequiously devoted . THO . HEYVVOOd â–ª
