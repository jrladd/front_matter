TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL JOHN ROLLS Eſquire , one of the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS of the High Court of PARLIAMENT . SIR , IT is above thirty years ſince the Lord hath brought me to be and inhabitant of Woolchurch ; And for the greattr part of this time , the providence of God hath ſo ordered it , that I have enjoyed your acquaintance , which hath been profitable , both to the outward and inward man , although of late , by reaſon of your great and high employments for God and man , there hath not been that personal ſociety as heretofore ; yet I often ſee you to participate in the beſt and excellent places of found Doctrine , in the way of truth and ſalvation , which with the knowledge I have of you , hath often moved my heart and ſpirit , to ſupplicate the God of heaven for you , as for my ſelf , to whom it hath pleaſed God to make his Truth ſo known , as to make me a child of it above twenty years ſince , which heavenly Principles had I ſo heeded and improved as I ought , I might have been by this time a ſtrong man in Chriſt Jeſus . How ever , Sir , I muſt confess to you , Gods mercies have been more and abundantly greater then my own misery's ; and notwithſtanding mine own natural indiſpoſition and unaptness to the good and straight way of the Lord ; yet he hath ſo magnified his good will and compaſsion , as thereby to make me one , though the leaſt of his Diſciples , who therefore cannot , nay dare not , but ſpeak the things I have ſeen and learned of him , notwithſtanding the Cross and perſecution that attend on the obeying and declaring the truth , a part whereof you may ſee , if you pleaſe to take view of theſe few enſuing lines , where you may obſerve , that the teſtifying to the abundant mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt manifeſted in the Sacrament , as in the Word , even for this , many are offended and riſe up againſt me , and do as much as in them lies , to make the world believe , that though they know me , yet they know me not ; ſo as that I am ſeen , and not diſcerned : and yet I fear not for to ſpeak , though I care not to be known , except to you and the whole household of faith , to whom the Lord continue his love and goodness , which ſhall be ever the prayer of him , who is truly yours and theirs , J. G.
