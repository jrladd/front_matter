TO HIS HIGHNES CHARLES LODOWICK : PRINCE ELECTOVR COUNT PALATINE OF THE RHENE , AND DVKE OF BAVARIA . SIR , AFTER I had traveled through the world in speculation , by translating and augmenting of ATLAS MAJOR in English , dedicated to his most excellent Majesty your Uncle , & my dread Sovereign : I could give no rest unto my thoughts till I had undertaken some thing of my own profession , which might give light , understanding , and instruction , unto some young Gentlemen , Soldiers and others , who desire to follow the wars , and to study this Art Military , for their princes service , and the good of their Country . And where could I find a fitter place , and a better subject to work upon , then in these United Provinces , under the command of the Lords , the STATES GENERALL , and his Highness the Prince of ORANGE , which now in regard of their long Wars may truly be called a nursery , and sedes belli , for the breeding and training up of Soldiers , and verily how could I do better then to begin ad principium , with the very first principles , and rudiments of the Art Military , Practised in these Wars , under the command , first of Prince MAURICE , of blessed Memory , and now under the able conduct of that great and victorious Captain General of our age , his Highness the Prince of Orange his Brother . Now beside what experience my long service hath gained under their Command , for the space of fortie years , as and addition thereunto , I have god some translations and extracts out of the best and choicest Authors of our modern times , who have writ upon this subject , to give lustre unto it , and having before by the assistance of God , run through the first two parts : I have now also finished my third part , concerning all preparations and necessaries appertaining to and Army , and so to put and end unto this laborious work , For in my first part I promised the right honourable the Earl of Holland , and in my second part my noble Colonel , that I would go through the three whole parts , for the arming of a Soldier , de cap en pied , that is at all points , which now thanks be to God I have done , to the end , that such as may go into , his Majesties service , your Highnesses , or any other foreign State or Princes , may gain some experience , and reap some benefit by my labours , which is , and was the principal thing I aimed at , For I hope , as old as I am , when these unhappy differences at home are reconciled , appeased and composed , that God , who leads the hearts of all Kings in his hand , as the Water of brooks , will so direct his Majesties heart for your right , that his Majesty will assist your Highness , and turn his powerful Arms another way , and make your Highness General of a brave British Army , for the vindicating of your injuries , and the recovery of your lawful and ancient rights and inheritances , against the usurpers thereof . I will not trouble your Highness any longer with a tedious discourse , seeing my self , and thousands of true hearted Brittaines beside my self , ( whensoever his sacred Majesty and our dread Sovereign shall lay his commands upon us ) shall be all willing to fight in so just a quarrel , for your Highness , and lay our lives down at your feet , and your Queen mother's , for the regaining of your Highnesses Rights and Countries . This third part then of the Principles of the Art Military , comes in all humility to present it self unto your Highnesses gracious pratronage , that though it be mean in itself , yet it craves to comeforth to the view of the world , under your illustrious name , which if it may be acceptable unto your Highness , then I shall think my weak endeavours happily sacrificed , and acknowledge my self much obliged to your Highness , and shall not only be bound to pray unto the Lord of Hosts , to honour and bless your proceedings here in this world with happy success , but also to crown you , your Royal Mother the Queen of Virtues , and her princely progeny with eternal felicity hereafter , beseeching your Highness to believe , that no creature living shall more heartily fight , nor more willingly die in your service , then Sir , Your Highnesses ever most humble , Obedient , and devoted Servant , HENRY HEXHAM .
