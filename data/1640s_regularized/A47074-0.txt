Worthy D. Gouge , REmembering your ancient acquaintance with me and my Father long since at rest , I presume to father this naked child Without Scholastic phrases , or School learning to dress it and garnish it , and so bring it forth to further view , knowing by experience , and also you were well reported of for the opening of Doctrines , seeing you have had a word of knowledge to preach the Doctrine of Repentance from dead works and faith towards God , and have sweetly taught Christ in his Priestly Office , I beseech you leave some good savour of your name before the close of your eyes concerning Christs Kingly Office ; open the Doctrine of the laying on of hands , and rest not in the ceremony which hath been used by the laying on of hands of bloody persecutors , I hope you will be wary of new inventions , to lay on fowl hands again , lean not to their wisdom that have so long erred , take the advice of the Assembly of the Saints , and so of the spouse of Christ who washes her hands in innocence and compasseth the Altar , let her have her due benevolence and so her right ; as she is the Eldership to lay on hands by whom she shall appoint . Sir , there was much jelosie of you in the time of the Prelates , that you were too full of fears , And now the Lord hath shortened those days of persecution ; and you have a prize in your hand , being one of the Masters of the Assembly , fasten some nail concerning the Doctrine of laying on of hands , which will clear up holy fellowship and take off that aspersion laid upon your congregations , that they are false ; none of Christs , but Antichristian : Though I do not for my part say so of them , yet the Doctrine of Baptism and the Doctrine of laying on of hands is left out of them , notwithstanding the ceremonies have been of Baptism and laying on of hands with more then needed which makes some to go to a second Baptism . And on other form , some are seekers out of a Baptism looking for Elyas as John the Baptist to bring it from heaven , forsaking all fellowship till Christ shall send forth new Apostles to lay on hands ; All this is ( as I conceive ) is for want of the knowledge of those two middle principals , seeing these things are come to pass in your days , before your end ; labour in the word and doctrine to clear up those two principals , so to our great Doctor I leave you to teach you the mysteries of the Kingdom , resting ever to love the Saints . S. Iones I Printed a few for my own use , because I would not lose my thoughts , & for such as shall council me for the best ; for without council the thoughts perish . If herein I have failed , I hope it will be easily passed by being the first fault upon that subject of laying on hands desiring to provoke to love & goodworks , so to him that hath loves to bestow upon his beloved , who is the wonderful councillor . I leave all the work .
