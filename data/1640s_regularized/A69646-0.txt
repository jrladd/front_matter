To the PARLAMENT . THE Book which among other great and high points of reformation , contains as a principal part thereof , this treatise here presented , Supreme Court of Parliament , was by the famous Author Martin Bucer , dedicated to Edward the sixt : whose incomparable youth doubtless bad brought forth to the Church of England such a glorious manbood , bade his life reached it , as would have left in the affairs of religion , nothing without and excellent pattern for us now to follow . But since the secret purpose of divine appointment hath reserved no less perhaps then the just half of such a sacred work to be accomplished in this age , and principally , as we trust , by your successful wisdom and authority , religious Lords and Commons , what wonder if I seek no other , to whose exactest judgement , and revieu I may commend these last and worthiest labours of this renowned teacher : whom living , all the pious nobility of those reforming times , your truest and best imitated ancestors , reverenced and admired . Nor was be wanting to a recompense as great as was himself ; when both at many times before , and especially among his last sighs and prayers testifying his dear and fatherly affection to the Church and Realm of England , he sincerely wished in the hearing of many devout men , that what he had in this his last book * Nicol . de obit Bri. written to King Edward concerning discipline , might have place in this Kingdom . His hope was then that no calamity , no confusion , or deformity would happen to the Commonwealth ; but otherwise he feared , lest in the midst of all this ardency to know God , yet by the neglect of discipline , our good endeavours would not succeed . These remarkable words of so godly and so eminent a man at his death , as they are related by a sufficient and well known witness , who herd them and inserted by Thuanus into his grave and serious history , so ought they to be chiefly considered by that nation for whose sake they were uttered , and more especially by that general Counsel which represents the body of that nation . If therefore the book , or this part thereof , for necessary causes , be now revived and recommended to the use of this undisciplined age , it hence appears that these reasons have not erred in the choyee of a fit patronage , for a discourse of such importance . But why the whole tractat is not beer brought entire , but this matter of divorcement selected in particular , to prevent the full speed of some misinterpreter , I hasten to disclose . First , it will be soon manifest to them who know what wise men should know , that the constitution and reformation of a commonwealth , if Ezra and Nehemiah did not mis-reform , is , like a building , to begin ord • rly from the foundation thereof , which is marriage and the family , to set right fi • st what ever is amiss therein . How can there else grow up a raze of warrantable men , while the house and home that breeds them , is troubled and disquieted under a bondage not of Gods constraining with a natureles conste • int ( if his most right • us judgements may be our rule ) but laid upon us imp • iously in the worst and weakest ages of knowledge , by a canonical tyranny of stupid and malicious Monks : who having rashly vowed themselves to a single life , which they could not undergo , invented new fetters to throw on matrimony , that the world thereby waxing more dissolute , they also in a general looseness might sin with more favour . Next , there being yet among many , such a strange iniquity and perverseness against all necessary divorce , while they will needs expound the words of our Saviour not duly by comparing other places , as they must do in the resolving of a hunder'd other Scriptures , but by persisting deafely in the abrupt and Papistical way • of a literal apprehension against the direct analogy of sense , reason , law and Gospel , it therefore may well seem more then time to apply the found and holy persuasions of this Apostolic man , to that part in us , which is not yet fully dispossessed of and error as absurd , as most that we deplove in our blindest adversaries ; and to let his authority and unanswerable reasons be vulgarly known , that either his name , or the force of his doctrine may work a wholesome effect . Lastly , I find it clear to be the authors intention that this point of divorcement should be • eld and received as a most necessary and prime part of discipline in every Christian government . And therefore having reduced his model of reformation to 14. heads , he bestows almost as much time about this one point of divorce , as about all the rest ; which also was the judgement of his heirs and learned friends in Germany , best acquainted with his meaning ; who first publishing this his book by Oporinus at Basil ( a City for learning and constancy in the the true faith , honourable among the first ) added a special note in the title , that there the reader should find the doctrine of Divorce handled so solidly , and so fully , as scars the like in any Writer of that age : and with this particular commendation they doubted not to dedicate the book , as a most profitable & exquisite discourse , to Christian the 3d , a worthy & pious King of Denmark , as the author himself had done before to our Edward the sixt . Yet did not Bucer in that volume only declare what his constant opinion was herein , but also in his comment upon Matthew , written at Strasburgh diverse years before , he treats distinctly and copiously the same argument in three several places ; touches it also upon the 7. to the Roman , & promises the same solution more largely upon the 1. to the Corintbians , omitting no occasion to weed out this last and deepest mischief of the Canon law sown into the opinions of modern men against the laws and practice both of Gods chosen people , and the best primitive times . Wheri • his faithfulness and powerful evidence prevailed so far with all the Church of Strasburgh , that they published this doctrine of divorce , as and article of their confession , after they had taught so eight and twenty years , through all those times , when that City flourished , and excelled most , both in religion , learning , and good government , under those first restorers of the Gospel there , Zellius , Hedio , Capito , Fagius , and those who incomparably then governed the Commonwealth , Farrerus and Sturmius . If therefore God in the former age found out a servant , and by whom he had converted and reformed many a city , by him thought good to restore the most needful doctrine of divorce from rigorous and harmful mistakes on the right hand , it can be no strange thing if in this age be stir up by whatsoever means whom it pleases him , to take in hand & maintain the same assertion . Certainly if it be in men discerning to sever providence from chance , I could allege many instances , wherein there would appear cause to esteem of me no other then a passive instrument under some power and counsel higher and better then can be human , working to a general good in the whole course of this matter . For that I owe no light , or leading received from anyman in the discovery of this truth , what time I first undertook it in the doctrine and discipline of divorce , and had only the infallible grounds of Scripture to be my guide , he who tries the inmost heart , and saw with what severe industry and examination of my self , I set down ever • perjod , will be my witness , When I had almost finished the first edition , I chanced to read in the notes of H • go Grotius upon the 5. oh • Matth. whom I strait understood inclining to reasonable terms in this controversy : and something be whispered rather then disputed about the law of charity , and the true end of wedlock , Glad therefore of such and able assistant , how ever at much distance , I resolved at length to put off into this wild and calumnious world . For God , it seems , intended to prove me , whither I durst alone take up a rightful cause against a world of disesteem , & found I durst . My name I did not publish , as not willing it should sway the reader either for me or against me . But when I was told , that the style , which what it ails to be so soon distinguishable , I cannot tell , was known by most men , and that some of the Clergy began to inveigh and exclaim on what I was credibly informed they had not read , I took it then for my proper season both to show them a name that could easily contemn such as indiscreet kind of censure , and to reinforce the question with a more accurate diligence : that if any of them would be so good as to leave railing , and to let us hear so much of his learning and Christian wisdom , as will be strictly demanded of him in his answering to this probl • me , care was had he should not spend his prep • rations against 〈 ◊ 〉 pamphlet . By this time I had l • rnt that Paulus Fagius , one of the chief Divines in Germany , sent for by Frederic the Pa • tine , to reform his dominion ; and after that invited hither in King Edwards days to be Professor of Divinity in Cambridge , was of the same opinion touching divorce , which these men so lavishly traduced in me . What I found , I inserted where fittest place was , thinking sure they would respect so g • have and author , at lest to the moderating of their odious inferences . And having now perfected a second edition , I referred the judging thereof to your high and impartial sentence , honoured Lords and Commons . For I was confident , if any thing generous , any thing noble , and above the multitude , were left yet in the spirit of England , it could be no where sooner found , and no where sooner understood , then in that house of justice and true liberty where you fit in c • sell . Nor does the event hitherto , for some reasons which I shall not • eer deliver , fail me of what I conceived so highly . Nevertheless being far otherwise dealt with by some , of whose profession and supposed knowledge I had better hope , and esteemed the deviser of a new and pernicious paradox , I felt no difference within me from that peace & firmness of mind , which is of nearest kin to patience and contentment : both for that I knew I had divulged a truth linked inseparably with the most fundamental rules of Christianity , to stand or fallen together , and was not uninformed that diverse learned and judicious men testified their d • ily approbation of the book . Yet at length it hath pleased God , who had already given me satisfaction in my self , to afford me now a means whereby I may be fully justified also in the eyes of men . When the book had been now the second time set forth wellnigh three months , as I best remember , I then first came to hear that Martin Bucer had written much concerning divorce : whom earnestly turning over , I soon p • rceaved , but not without amazement , in the same opinion , confirmed with the same reasons which in that published book without the help or imitation of any precedent Writer , I had laboured out , and laid together . Not but that there is some difference in the handling , in the order , and the number of arguments , but still agreeing in the same conclusion . So as I may justly gram • ulat mine own mind , with due acknowledgement of assistance from above , which led me , not as a learner , but as a collateral teacher , to a sympathy of judgement with no less am in then Martin Bucer . And he , if our things her below arrive him where he is , does not rep • nt him to see that point of knowledge which he first , and with and unche • tO freedom preached to those more knowing times of England , now found so necessary , though what he admonished were lost out of our memory , yet that God does now again create the same doctrine in another un • table , and raises it up immediately out of his pure oracle to the convincement of 〈 ◊ 〉 p • rvers age , eager in the reformation of names and ceremonies , but i • real • ies as traditional and as ignorant as their forefathers . I would ask now the foremost of my profound accusers , whither they dare affirm that to be lic • ntious , new and dangerous , which Martin Bucer so often , and so urgently avouched to be most lawful , most necessary , and most Christian , without the lest blemish to his good name , among all the worthy men of that age , and since , who testify so highly of him ? If they dare , they must then set up and arrogance of their own against all those Churches and Saints who honoured him without this exception : If they dare not , how can they now make that licentious doctrine in another , which was never blamed , or confuted in Bucer , or in Fagius ? The truth is , there will be due to them for this their unadvised rashness , the best donative that can be given them , I mean , a round reproof ; now that where they thought to be most Magisterial , they have displayed their own want , both of reading , and of judgement . First , to be so unacquainted in the writings of Bucer , which are so obvious and so useful in their own faculty ; next , to be so caught in a prejudicating weakness , as to condemn that for lewd , which ( whither they knew or not ) these elect servants of Christ commended for lawful ; and for new , that which was taught by these almost the first and greatest authors of reformation , who were never taxed for so teaching ; and dedicated without scruple to a royal pair of the first reforming Kings in Christendom , and confessed in the public confession of a most orthodoxal Church & state in Germany . This is also another fault which I must tell them ; that they have stood now almost this whole year clamouring a far off , while the book hath been twice printed , twice bought up , & never once vouches • a friendly conference with the author , who would be glad and thankful to be sh • wn and error , either by private dispute , or public answer , and could retract , as well as wise men before him ; might also be worth the gaining , as one who heretofore , hath done good service to the Church by their own confession . Or if he be obstinate , their confutation would have rendered him without excuse , and reclaimed others of no mean parts who incline to his opinion . But now their work is more then doubled ; and how they will hold up their heads against the sudden aspect of these two great and reverend S • ints whom they have desamed , how they will make good the censuring of that for a novelty of licence , which Bucer constantly taught to be a pure and holy law of Christs kingdom , let them advice . For against these my adversaries , who before the examining of a propounded truth in a fit time of reformation , have had the conscience to oppose • ght 〈 ◊ 〉 but their blind reproaches and surmises , that a single innocence might not be oppr • st and overborne by a c • owe of mouths for the restoring of a law and doctrine falsely and unlearnedly reputed new and scandalous , God , that I may ever magnify and record this his goodness , hath unexpectedly raised up as it were from the dead , more then one famous light of the first reformation to bear witne • with me , and to d • e me honour in that very thing , wherein these men thought to have blotted me : And hath given them the proof of a capacity which they despised , running equal , and authentic with some of their chiefest master's unthought of , and in a point of sagest moment . However , if we know at all , when to ascribe the occurrences of this life to the work of a special providence , as nothing is more usual in the talk of good men , what can be more like to a special providence of God , then in the first reformation of England , that this question of divorce , as a main thing to be restored to just freedom , was written , and seriously c • mmended to Edward the sixt , by a man called from another Country to be the instructer of our nation , and now in this pres • nt renewing of the Church and Commonwealth , which we pray may be more lasting , that the same question should be again treated and presented to this Parliament , by one enabled to use the same reasons without the lest sighed or knowledge of what was done before . It were no trespass , Lords and Commons , though something of less note were attributed to the ordering of a heavenly power ; this question therefore of such prime concernment both to Christian and civil welfare , in such and extraordinary manner , not recovered , but plainly twice born to these latter ages , as from a divine hand I tender to your acceptance , and most considerate thoughts . Think not that God raised up in vain a man of greatest a • ority in the Church to tell a trivial and licentious tale in the ears of that good Prince , and to bequeathe it as his last will and testament , nay rather as the testamont and royal law of Christ to this Nation , or that it should of it self after so many years , as it were in a new field where it was never sown , grow up again as a vicious plant in the mind of another , who had spoke honestest things to the Nation ; though he knew not that what his youth then reasoned without a pattern , had been herd already , and well allowed from the gravity and worth of Martin Bucer : till meeting with the envy of men ignorant in their own undertake calling , God directed him to the forgotten Writings of this faithful Evangelist , to be his defence and warrant against the gross imputation of broaching licence . You are now in the glorious way to high virtue , and matchless deeds , trusted with a most inestimable trust , the asserting of our just liberties . You have a nation that expects now , and from mighty sufferings aspires to be the example of all Christendom to a perfetest reforming . Dare to be as great , as ample , and as eminent in the fair progress of your noble designs , as the full and goodly stature of truth and excellence it self : as unlimited by petty presidents and copies , as your unquestionable calling from heaven giv • you power to be . What are all our public immunities and privileges worth , and how shall it be judged that we sighed for them with minds worthy to enjoy them , if we suffer our selves in the mean while not to understand the most important freedom that God and Nature hath givn us in the family ; which not wise Nation ever wanted , till the Popery and superstition of some former ages attempted to remove and altar divine and most prudent Laws for human and most imprudent Canons ; whereby good men in the best portion of tO • ir lives , and in that ordinance of God which entitles them from the beginning to most just and requisite contentment's , are compelled to civil indignities , which by the law of Moses bad men were not compelled to . Be not bound about , and straitened in the spacious wisdom of your free Spirits , by the scanty and unadequat and inconsistent principles of such as condemn others for adhering to traditions , and are themselves the prostrate worshippers of Custom ; and of such a tradition as they can deduce from no antiquity , but from the rud • st , and thick • st barbarism of Antichristian times . But why do I anticipate the more acceptable , and prevailing voice of learned Bucer himself , the pastor of Nations ? And Oh that I could set him living before you in that doctoral chair , where once the lernedest of England thought it no disparagement to fit at his feet ▪ He would be such a pilot , and such a father to you , as you would soon find the difference of his hand and skill upon the helm of reformation . Nor do I forget that faithful associate of his labours , Paulus Fagius ; for these their great names and merits , how precious so ever , God hath now joined with me necessarily , in the good or evil report of this doctrine which I leave with you . It was written to a religious King of this land ; written earnestly , as a main matter where in this kingdom needed a reform , if it purposed to be the kingdom of Christ : Written by him who if any since the worser • ies of Luther , merits to be counted the Apostle of our Church ; whose unw • aried pains and watching for our sakes , as they spent him quickly her among us , so did they , during the shortness of his life , incredibly promote the Gospel throughout this Realm . The authority , the learning , the godliness of this man consulted with , is able to outbalance all that the lightness of a vulgar opposition can being to counterpoise . I leave him also as my complete surety and testimonial , if Truth be not the best witness to it self , that what I formerly presented to your reading on this subject , was good , and just , and honest , not licentious . Not that I have now more confidence by the addition of these great Authors to my party ; for what I wrote was not my opinion , but my knowledge ; evn then when I could trace no footstep in the way I went : nor that I think to win upon your apprehensions with numbers and with names , rather then wi • h reasons , yet certainly the worst of my worser • tracters will not except against so good a bail of my integrity and judgement , as now appears for me . They must else put in the fame of Bucer and of Fagins , as my accomplices and confederates into the same endightment ; they must dig up the good name of these prime worthies ( if their names could be ever buried ) they must dig them up and brand them as the Papists did their bodies ; and those their pure unblamable spirits , which live not only in heaven , but in their writings , they must attaint with new attaintures which no Protestant ever before aspersed them with . Or if perhaps we may obtain to get our appeachment new drawn a Writ of Error , not of Libertinism , that those two principal leaders of reformation may not come now to be sued in a bill of licence , to the scandal of , our Church , the brief result will be , that for the error , if their own works be not thought sufficient to defend them , there livs yet who will be ready , in a fair and christianly discussive way , to debate and sift this matter to the utmost ounce of learning and religion , in him that shall lay it as and error , either upon Martin Bueer , or any other of his opinion . If this be not enough to qualify my traducers , and that they think it more for the wisdom of their virulence , not to recant the injuries they have bespoke me , I shall not for much more disturbance then they can bring me , intermit the prosecution of those thoughts which may render me best serviceable , either to this age , or if it so happen , to posterity ; following the fair path which your illustrious exploits , Honoured Lords and Commons , against the breast of tyranny have opened ; and depending so on your happy successes in the hope's that I have conceived either of my self , or of the Nation , as must needs conclude me one who most affectionately wishes and awaits the prosperous issue of your noble and valorous counsels . JOHN MILTON .
