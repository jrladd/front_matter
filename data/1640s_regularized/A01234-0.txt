To the right Worshipful , Sir Nicholas Rainton , Knight , Preſident , the Worshipful Martin Bound , Eſquire , Treaſurer , with the Governors of the Hospital of little S Bartholomewes , W. F. wishes that Grace and Peace may be multiplied . WHat I ſtudied for your private Chapel , and there delivered before ſome of you , on Tueſday the 19. of Iune , laſt passed , I have been importuned to make public , as for a common good . If it be good , then quò communius , eò melius , the more public it becomes , the more good it may do . I wished well in the ſtudy and delivery of it to as many as deſire the proſperity of our royal foundation . In the publiſhing of it , I would gladly have it conceived that my zeal is the ſame for the public welfare ▪ If that memorable act of your piety ▪ which occaſioned this Sermon , ſhall provoke ſome well minded ones to imitate your example elſewhere , or incite the able handed to promote ſuch charitable undertakings for the comfort of ſo many ſick and diſtreſſed souls daily by your care refreſhed : it may redound much to Gods glory , your own comforts , and the happiness of thoſe whom God ſhall move hereby to tread in your ſteps . If no ſuch thing ſucceed , yet it ſhall be your honour to have lighted up the candle of ſo good and example for the times to come : as it is , and ſhall be , for you all , that God may long continue to our Hospital , your pious care for the happy and orderly government thereof , the daily prayer of Your Hoſpitaler , William Freak . From my Study in your Hospital the 12 day of Feb. 1639.
