To the much and worthily Honoured Sr. ROBERT HARLEY Knight of the Honourable Order of the Bath , and Knight of the Honourable House of Commons for the County of He • eford . THe desire I had to profess my devoted Service to the pious designs of your honourable Senate , disposed me to a boldness of offering this ensuing Discourse by a general Dedication to your whole House . But my judgement ( upon second cogitations ) gave check to that conceit , as making too near and approach , towards some presumption , and directed me to valve it , below the rate of a competent Present , for so many , so worthy persons of your Assembly , and to select some Patron among you for a singular inscription . Thence were my thoughts conducted to your Self ( noble Sir ) to whom ( for your prudent and constant Zeal , to advance all just and conscionable causes , and your many affectionate expressions of respect to me both present and absent ) I held my self obliged to take this opportunity , to tender a token of a grateful memory of such favour as ( without the guilt of ungratitude ) I can neither forget nor forbear to acknowledge . And I should be as ungodly as ungrateful , if ( considering your intentive incumbency upon the common cares of the Church and Sta • e ) I should not ( both in Church and Closet ) address my heartiest devotions to the Lord Almighty , to preserve your person ( with the rest of your venerable Associates ) and to prosper your consultations with such happy success , as m • y occasion and exchange of prayers into praises . In both which sacred Services ( with reference to you and yours , in nearest relations ) none shall be more sincere and serious then he who will never be wanting , Great Budworth , Septem . 20. 1641. Unfeignedly to honour and faithfully to serve you JOHN LEY .
