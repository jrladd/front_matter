TO THE RIGHT Honourable , HENRY Earl of Holland , and Baron of Kenſington , chief Gentleman of his Majeſties Bedchamber , chief Juſtice , and Juſtice in Eyre of all his Majeſties Foreſts , Chaſes , Parks , and Warrens on this ſide Trent ; Chancellor of the University of Cambridge ; Conſtable of the royal Caſtle of Windſor , one of his Majeſties moſt Honourable privy Conceal , and Knight of the moſt noble order of the Ga • ter . Right Honourable , A Debtor I acknowledge my self unto the Church of God by calling , & a special engagement lies upon me , both of truſt and promiſe to ſerve the Church in this way , in bringing towards the furtherance of the building of it , that which hath been ſquared and framed to my hand by a wiſe Master builder , who hath ſhowed himself approved unto God , a workman that needs not to be aſhamed . This I do here humbly preſent unto your Honours protection ; I may perhaps from ſome , incur the cenſure of too much boldness in uſing your Honours name , but your courtesy and ſweet affability ſpringing from your native gentelneſſe of diſpoſition does ſecure me : and the rather ſince I preſent this unto your Honour , not in my own name , but in the name and behalf of the Widow , who though ſhe may claim the privilege of her Sex from appearing in Print herself , yet she is deſirous that the living and laſting Monuments of her deer huſband ſhould be brought forth for the good of Gods Church , under the patronage and protection of your Honour , to whom the Author was every way ſo much obliged ; now I have no reaſon to doubt but that as your Honour was pleaſed to take the Reverend and learned Author into the protection of your noble family , for you will be pleaſed to countenance theſe his own legitimate children , which are now ſent abroad as Orphans deprived of their father . Their own worth cannot but gain them esteem , but I know your Honour will prize them the more for their father's ſake : who whilst he was alive did ſecure your Honour by his Prayers which he did daily offer up to God , not pro forma as a legal and dead ceremony , but pro Anima , as a spiritual and lively ſacrifice , in the behalf of your honour and happiness , and now that he is dead yet speaks in theſe and thoſe other Sermons of his which bear your honours name . If you be pleaſed to patronise , countenance and peruſe them , they will reflect much brightness upon your nobleness , as they receive ſplendour from it . Thus under your Honours protection I do preſent them unto the world , humbly craving the privilege of your pardon for my boldness , and heartily beſeeching the Lord to make you ſtill and ſtill to do worthily in Iſrael and to enrich your Honour more and more with grace here and glory hereafter . Your Honours humbly devoted in all duty and obſervance , A. B.
