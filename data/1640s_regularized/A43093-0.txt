To the Honourable Sir Anthony Weldon Knight , and the reſt of the Honble Deputy Lieutenants and Committees of the County of Kent . Honourable Gentlemen , THE noble favours I daily receive from you , ſince my arrival out of Ireland , into this County , hath emboldened me to offer this poor tribute of mine experience , not to teach your uncontrollable knowledges , but humbly deſire it may kiss your hands , as a ſacrifice offered from your ſervant , or as a weakness that ſtands in need of your protections . In your Honours I know is power to judge of my labour , and in you alſo is power to exerciſe mercy ; I hope I have written nothing that is erring from sense or truth : having not laboured mine own , but the profit of my poor bleeding , dying Countrymen , whom theſe miſerable times have called out to this miſerable unnatural War : deſiring not only his temporal victory , ( but above all ) his spiritual . There may be many puny Scholars that from theſe brief Rules , may gather more abler judgements : Your noble favours and allowance can only make it acceptable to thoſe which need it , eſpecially in this Country , which I wiſh to be ſerved by it : then let thoſe graces fly from your noble nature's , that as now I live , I may die your Honours poor Servant and Soldier L.
