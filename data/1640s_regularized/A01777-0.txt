TO THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF VERTVE AND TRUE MECENAS OF Liberal Arts ; Mr. WILLIAM MURREY of his Majesties Bedchamber . SIR , GRatitude is the best Appendix to virtue : unthankfulness the worst addit on to vice . My endeavour to achieve the one , and avoid the other , invited me to this publication of my many engagements to your best self : and betrayed your noble name to the patronage of this Poem . The native magnificence of your disposition is so replete with mercy , that it would be and error in the religion of my duty , should I question your remission of this audacious crime , the offence being only the acknowledgement of my respective service to you . Works of this nature have always assumed this privilege , to aspire the noblest for their Protectors . Since then authorisd by custom , worthiest Sir , it cannot be a diminution to your fame , nor repugnant to the gravity of your most serious employments to have him by public profession known your servant , who hath long since by particular devotion been The humblest of your honorers , HEN . GLAPTHORNE .
