TO HIS EVER-HONOURED , NOBLE , KIND FRIENDS , THE Right Honourable Lord Ferdinando Fairfax , the Right Worshipful , Sir William Waller , and Sir William Bruerton , Knights , Commanders in Chief , of the Parliaments Forces , in several Counties . Deservedly Renowned Worthies , YOUR Incomparable Valour , Zeal , Activity , Industry for the preservation of Your Dearest Country , Religion , Laws , Liberties , and the very being of Parliaments , all now endangered by and unnatural generation of Popish and Malignant Vipers , lately risen up in Arms against them in diverse parts of this Realm ; and those many miraculous Victories with which God hath been lately pleased to Crown your cordial endeavours , to promote his glory and the Public safety , as they have justly demerited some grateful general Acknowledgements from the whole Representative Body of the State ; so they may in some sort challenge a private gratulatory Retribution from Me , who have formerly had the happiness to participate in your Christian Affections , and now reap much Consolation by your Heroic Actions . Having therefore seasonably finished this Third part , Of the Sovereign Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms ; copiously Vindicating , the Lawfulness , Justness of the Parliaments present Necessary Defensive War ( in which you have had the Honour to be employed , not only as Chief , but which is more , as most successful Commanders , in your several Countries , ) in point both of Law and Conscience ; and fully wiping off those black Aspersions , of TREASON and REBELLION , which the opposite party ( really guilty of these crimes against both King and Kingdom , as I havePart 1. Edit . 2 p. 108 , to 112. elsewhere manifested , and here lightly touched ) have out of Malice , Ignorance , or both conjoined , most injuriously cast upon your Loyal , honourable proceedings , which rejoice the souls of all true Philopa • ers , who cordially affect their Country or Religion ; I could not , without much ingratitude , yea injustice , have published it to the world , but under the Patronage of your ever-honored res • lendent names , who have so valorously , so successfully pleaded this Cause already in the Field , that it needs the less assistance from the Press . My many inevitable interruptions and straits of time in its contexture , which may happily detract something from its perfection ; shall I hope , derogate nothing from your Honourable , Friendly acceptation ; whom I have thus conjoined in the Dedication ; because the Parliament hath united you in their present Warlike employments , and God himself jointly honoured you with success , even to admiration among the Good , indignation amid Malignants , envy with the Malicious , and , I trust , to and active sedulous em • lation in all your Fellow Commanders , employed in other Quarters in the selfsame Cause . Your present busy public , and mine own private Employments , prohibit me to expatiate ; Wherefore earnestly beseeching the Glorious Lord of Hosts to be ever mightily present with your several Noble Persons , Forces , and to make you always eminently , active , Valorous , Victorious , as hitherto he hath done , till Peace and Truth , Tranquillity and Piety , by your several triumphant Proceedings , shall once more lovingly embrace and kiss each other in our divided unreformed , sinful Kingdom ; And till the effect of these just wars You manage , shall be quietness and assurance to us and our Posterities after us for ever ; I humbly recommend your Persons , Proceedings to his protection who can secure you in and from all dangers of war , and rest , Your Honours , Worships most affectionate Friend and Servant , WILLIAM PRYNNE .
