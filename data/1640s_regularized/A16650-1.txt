TO HIS DAINTY DOXES . DAINTY fine Creatures , — I will not swear , in good faith you be ; But — if in your censure you prove sweet to me , I little care , believe iT , how sour you be . One thing I must tell you , the World ha a strange opinion of you : But let not this trouble you : for the most of those that sojourn in it , are Walking Pictures , or Puppy Motions . So you live without Scandal , let the Constable of the Ward snore , and Diogenes walk all the night over with his Candle . Though he find Works of lightness in Houses of darkness : Single Skirmishes in blind Alleys , Backstairs , and long Entries : whole bunches of Cornucopia in his newfound Eutopia : Cleave you like Ticks to your own , preserve your renown , and sing Heigh down a down , to the honour of our Town . Thus , neither to all , nor to many , but to very-very few , and those of that Crew , who are loyal and true , bids Musaeus Adieu .
