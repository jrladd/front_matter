To thoſe Brothers of the Aſſembly of Divines , Petitioners who are for the pretended Divine Right of the preſent PRESBYTERY . BRETHREN , Meeting you out of the Aſſembly , or that bounder appointed you by Parl. I cannot juſtly be denied this reaſoning with you ; for the Ordinance by which you fit , does enable you only to advice of things propounded , but not to propound or demand any as you have done of late ; See Ordin . Jun. 12. 1043. p. 4. ſo as in this you have brought your ſelves down to the ſame magnitude with us that are private men . Here is the difference now ; You are many of better parts and abilities ; I am as one born out of due time ; yet the ſame Covenant is upon me with your ſelves , nor ought I becauſe I am but one , preſume to ſee Truth more then you becauſe you are many ; nor , I hope , you who are many , will preſume to ſee Truth more then one , becauſe you are many ; Nay,2 Pet. 1. 17. it is that voice from the excellent glory which both you and I muſt hear , and which can only teach us Truth ; It is not the voice of any other . And ſurely ſince Truth hath had its lot in the world to live upon voices in Aſſemblies and Synods , where that is only Truth which is voted ſo ; and not in its own glory and evidence , where that is only Truth which is ſo : The Myſtery of iniquity hath been more advanced then the Myſtery of godliness .
