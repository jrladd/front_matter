TO THE RIGHT WORTHY AND EVER HIGH ESTEEMED , Mr. RICHARD COMPTON , Eſquire , perpetual health and proſperity . THe many obligations ( honoured Sir ) which your deſerving actions have made me ſervant to draw me to another engagement , which is no less noble , then thoſe boundless bounties , which you ſo oft have conferred upon me : Therefore I now become and humble petitioner , that • tO your good liking will protect me from the detraction of all Mom • ſts and Zoylans ; and in ſo doing , I ſhall not fear that any one will ſay this my offspring is illegitimate , becauſe your favourable eye not only nullifies the malice of all adverſe wills , but adds baptism to this innocent , which here lies mute , wrapped up in the purity of white ſheets : nay more , your gentle worded cenſure confirms the ſame , and inliſts it in the roll of Fame and Reputation . Admire then this ſmall penſion of my brain with mild benevolence , ſo may you add courage to a young beginner , and make his Labour immortal by your ſmiling favour ; for except this model find mercy in your kind acceptance , the creation , which I beſtowed upon it , was only to make it nauſeall to all men's stomachs , and me ridiculous , becauſe I ever obſerved your word to be of more valve , then ever my merits could reach unto ; then what is it that Your countenance will not persuade , if You pleaſe to add but a few syllables to make your will appear ? Si dicas , factum eſt . If I thought or knew not your power to be prevalent in this which I requeſt , I would not have ſo audaciouſly adventured to solicit any ſuch courtesy ; but I am confirmed of this knowledge , and confident of your ever too little praiſed good nature , which is a perfect ſpark of that heavenly goodness which gives all things , becauſe Your chief deſire is to help Your friend with all ſort of encouragement poſſible , and communicating Your beſt endeavours to the bettering of all thoſe that ſtrive to deſerve : And therefore I am confident I ſhall find You my firm and real Friend , to gain that benevolence for me , for which I will ever remain Your faithful ſervant , IO . IOHNSON .
