TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS , AND Most Hopeful PRINCE , CHARLES , Prince of Wales . WEll may my Book come forth like Public Day , When such a Light as You are leads the way : Who are my Works Creator , and alone The Flame of it , and the Expansion . And look how all those heavenly Lamps acquire Light from the Sun , that inexhausted Fire : So all my Morn , and Evening Stars from You Have their Existence , and their Influence too . Full is my Book of Glories ; but all These By You become Immortal Substances .
