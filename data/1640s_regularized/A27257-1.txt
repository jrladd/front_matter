THE AUTHOR , TO the READER . WHen Johnson , Drayton , and those happier men That can drop wonders from their fluent Pen : Have with their miracles of Poetry Feasted thy ears and satisfied thy eye ; Then turn aside , and amongst the vulgar things , Place what my newborn Muse abruptly sings . Which though it be but mean ( as this confessed ) IT hath ventured hard to please thee , since this pressed . If thou smile on it , I shall think my brain Hath laboured for this issue not in vain , If otherwise thou do contemn my lays , My pleasure's more to me , then all thy praise . — Sat est pro laud Voluptas . — Vale . THOMAS BEEDOME .
