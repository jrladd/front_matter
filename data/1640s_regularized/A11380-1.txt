TO MY HONOURED Patron , Sir ARTHUR INGRAM the younger . SIr , I have obſerved you active in your converſation abroad and at home , and I could not ſtudy any thing I thought more suitable , and congruous , than theſe practical leaſes , which may at once recreate and instruct your retirement , instruct you not as mine but Gods , for his words are my ground and foundation both for place and ſenſe , and in this courſe I foreſaw ſaw most ſecurity , for here I have his Word for what I ſay , and I give you his Word for what you are to do , and my lines are but only drawn here to point you to the centre of the Scriptures : there your designs , your projects , may rest and rely . Sir , I know you have a breastplate rich enough of your own , yet to ſet and higher rate upon your counſels , be pleaſed to let theſe holy jewels of Gods Word ( which will be a bright Urim and Thummim to your boſom • ) have a place , and that I may be just to the brevity I profess in my Book , I hasten to be as I am ever bound , Sir , Your moſt devoted Servant J. SALTMARSHE .
