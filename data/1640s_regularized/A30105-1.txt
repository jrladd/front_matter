TO HIS HONOURED FRIEND WILLIAM DICONSON ESQUIRE . SIR , AFter I had once well relished the sweetness of your conversation ; having calculated your temper and disposition according to the meridian of Friendship , I soon proposed you to my self as and Idea and pattern of all Humanity . This apprehension I have of your virtues , is so deeply settled in my understanding , that I find it difficult to restrain affection from dilating upon this Argument , even to a Panegyric : Yet I confess I do not more truly honour and revere you under any one notion , as I do in that relation you stand in to my worthy Friend your Son , a relation which you have made more reverend and amiable , by the felicity of your comportment . There , Nature and Education are in their Zeniths . This is the Achma of worldly Beatitudes , when by a reciprocal invention , without the confusion of distance and proximity , reverence and affection ; there results by converse , Idem Alter , & Alter Idem : were not this a truth that hath oft been visible to discerning eyes , I might be thought a little to play the Poet , and this assertion taken for and Allegory . Sir , the congruity of this Art , with your Nature , in gaining upon the affections of men , hath made me pitch upon you as a competent Judge and Patron : To you therefore I consecrate this Fruit of my Hand , as to one well read in the prudential Laws of Civil Conversation , and by consequence knowing , to manage the Hand , of your Intellect and Reason ( your reason and speech ) to the best advantage and utterance of discretion and honesty . Be pleased in return of those expresses of your affection and respect I have received from you , to accept of this demonstration of respect from him , who is Your faithful friend to command , IO . BULVVER .
