TO The Right Honourable and Virtuous Lady , FRANCES Countess of Rutland , wife to the Right Honourable JOHN Earl of Rutland . Noble Lady , AS you have been pleased to make me happy , by permitting me to gaze with admiration upon the rare structure and goodly fabric of that beautiful temple of your Virtues ; so give me leave to pass through this , into your temple of Honour , and there , at the shrine of your perfections , to lay this Century of Divine Meditations ; a sacrifice , I know , more acceptable to you then whole Hecatombs of fat beasts , or the smoke of Sabean incense . Your noble Progenitors have devolved upon you many natural endowments , whereby you outstrip most of your own sex : but grace hath gifted you with clearness and perspicuity of judgement in the mysteries of speculative Divinity , even beyond many who think themselves learned Clerks of our sex . Madam , though you are every way honourable , yet nothing does so much ennoble you , as your zeal to Religion , and love to learned men : When your beauty , wealth , outward honours and pleasures shall determine in death , even then Religion and Learning will beautify and enrich your soul , and immortalise your name . The highest pitch of my ambition in this , and the former Dedication , is only to show my gratitude to your honourable Husband , and your Self , though in small mites , compared to your noble favours ; and withal , to set forth the lustre of your own knowledge in these points which still perplex the minds of many Christians . The Father of Mercies crown you both , and your hopeful Issue , with the blessings of both hands here , and of Eternity hereafter . This is , and still shall be , the prayer of Your Honours devoted Servant , Alexander Ross.
