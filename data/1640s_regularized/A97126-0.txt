TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the LORDS now Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT at Weſtminſter . MY LORDS ; I Have obſerved , that long Epiſtles are as little pleaſing as long Sermons ; and therefore ſhall not be troubleſome by a tedious Dedication : Only your Lordship's may pleaſe to take notice , that this Sermon , which is now Printed in obedience to your Order , before it goes forth to public view , comes firſt to be Preſented to your Honours . It is ſufficient aſſurance of acceptance and countenance , that your Lordship's pleaſure is to have it publiſhed . If now this little spark , or rather almoſt dead coal ; ſhall give the leaſt light or heat to any heart , that ſhall vouchſafe to read it ; and hereby any acceſsion may be made , to the praiſe , or to the fear of This glorious and fearful Name , Deut. 28. 58. THE LORD OƲR GOD : It is that which is deſired , and as much as can be expected by , MY LORDS , Your Honours moſt unworthy Servant in the work of the Ministry , JOHN WARD .
