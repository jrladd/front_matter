THE DEDICATORY . Go little Book , ( my unlicked Poetry ) And be a Patron to thy self and me , Shift it among the crowd , and never ſtay To dress thy self , like other trim and gay , • ith borrowed Titles , plucked from great Ones , who Are honoured by the Honour that they do , • ear thy own clothes , and think it more to be Known by thy face , then by a livery . • ever truſt unto found fickleness , that may Afford a ſmile at firſt , and then betray , That hiss and kill , that by embraces ſmother , With one hand take , and throw away with the other , That ow'n a Book , becauſe the 〈 ◊ 〉 owns them , Or elſe they never ow'n the Book again , Let thoſe that can warp Conſcience in a strain And count it but a Poets Spencer vein To fawn and flatter , and have learned to call ; One Good , becauſe he's Great , though worſt of all ; Let thoſe who can weigh virtue by the pound , Where it is ſcarce by Drammes and Ounces foum • Who make it then chief Maſterpiece of wit , To Bankrupt Honour by out-rayling it Who can ſay I , or No , ſweat , freeze , as he Is hight or could , who is their Deity . Let ſuch Idolators of Greatness show , They dare not walk abroad unless they go Under ſome He or Shee-Protection : My Muſe ſhall venture in another faſhion Make thine own licence ( little one ) and be Protection to thy self , a Pass to me . And let ſuch ſcratching Patron-mongers know Thou'lt not on ſtilts , nor yet on Crutches go , On thy own feet thou'lt either run or crawl And if thou • anſt not ſtand on them , thou'lt fallen , Weigh neither ſmile nor frown , but when you ſee Beſt uſage ſay , this ſhall my Patronbee : And as for others that disdain , ſay thou My Maſter owns me not , and why ſhould you ? Ʋade ( nec Invideo ) ſine me Liber Ibis ▪
