To the high , Noble , and moſt Illuſtrious : CHARLES , Prince of Wales , etc. SIr , let the ſtrength of my deſires to ſerve you , obtain your pardon , for this my trivial dedication . Yet if the title of this book be true , ( which is not mine , but the firſt authors ) it may prove worthy your inſpection ; if not , your perusal . For , the few rules therein contained , ( if he may be credited ) being well obſerved , will gain you the love of all men ; and ( conſequently ) command their obedience . Two things , which Princes , above others , have greatest need of , and wherein they become moſt happy , being made thereby , more abſolute , then either by rigor of Laws , or force of Arms . It is ( I confess ) moſt true , that the great deeds , and heroic actions of Princes , are of higheſt esteem : yet are they not ( therefore ) to be altogether regardless , even of their ordinary behaviour , and usual carriage . For as by them , they become moſt powerful , and renowned : ſo by theſe , ( if pleaſing , and graceful ) they grow more endeared , in the peoples affections . This treatiſe was firſt penned by a Courtier . Therefore if it be not well tranſlated , no marvel , for how ſhould a plodding Lawyer , make a neat conſtruction , of a quaint and polite Gallants meaning ? rude as it is , I hope your highness will be pleaſed to accept of it , not caſting your eye ſo much upon the courſe viſage , of the preſent , as upon the fair intentions of the preſenter . I confess there be no dainties in it , fit for your curious palate , yet ( I beſeech you ) be pleaſed to taste of it , that others , for whom ſuch courſe fare is far more proper , may thereby be brought , to reliſh it the better . All I will ſay in its commendation , is this : it is but brief , and is full of variety . Inner Temple the 28 of March , 1640. Sir , I am Your Highneſſes in all duty and obſervance to be commanded , William Style .
