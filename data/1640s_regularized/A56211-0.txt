TO THE Right Honourable Lords & Commons , Assembled in , and continuing Constantly with this present PARLIAMENT , both in Person and Affection . ETernally Renowned Senators , and most cordial Philopaters to Your bleeding , dying dearest Country , ( from which no menacing Terrors , of armed Adversaries , nor flattering Promises of hypocritical Court-friends , could hitherto divorce your sincerest Affections , and withdraw your undefatigablest Industries in the least degree , to its betraying , or enslaving ; ) I here humbly prostrate to your most mature Judgements , and recommend to your Highest , Noblest Patronage , this Quadruple Discourse , OF THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF PARLIAMENTS AND KINGDOMES , ( now at last compacted into one entire Body , though formerly scattered abroad in dismembered Parts , rather out of necessity to gratify others , then conveniency to content my self , ) in which as Your Honours have the greatest Interest , so it is just and equal You should enjoy the absolutest Propriety : being compiled by Your Encouragement , Printed by Your Authority ; published for Your Justification , to vindicate your indubitable ancient Sovereign Privileges from the unjust Detractions ; Your legal necessary late Proceedings , from the malicious , false , unjust Aspersions of those Royalists , Malignants , intemperate Pens & Tongues , 2 Pet 2. 12 , 14 , 15. Who like natural bruit beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things they understand not , and shall perish in their own corruption : Cursed children , who have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ; but was rebuked for his iniquity . I must ingenuously confess , that the Subject matter , and grand public Differences between King & Parliament ( yea between most Kings and Kingdoms in the world ) herein debated , are of such and extraordinary , rare , transcendent nature ; of such infinite , universal consequence , weight , concernment , yea so full of dangerous Precipes , Rocks , if not inextricable difficulties on either hand , as might justly require , not only one person of the exquisitest judgement , Heroicallest Spirit , greatest experience , deepest Policy , absolutest abilities , vastest knowledge in all kinds of Learning's , States , Governments ; and most exempt from all other employments , that might interrupt him in these kinds of Studies ; but even and whole Parliament , or Ecumenical Council of the most experienced , ablest , learnedest , wisest Statists in the Universe , and many years most advised consideration , exactly to ventilate and determine them : Which consideration might have justly daunted , yea quite deterred me , ( the meanest of ten thousand , furnished with no competent abilities , and having scarce one vacant hour , but what I have borrowed from my natural rest , to accomplish so vast and undertaking ) from this most difficult , weighty , public , service , sufficient to sink the strongest Hercules , if not Atlas himself , the world's supporter : But yet the Goodness , the Commonness of the Cause , ( which concerns our whole three Kingdoms , Parliaments , Religion , and every one of our well-beings , in this present world ) the deer affection , I bear to my native Country , Religion , Posterity , Parliaments , and your Honours ; the defect of other Advocates to plead this public Cause ; seconded with the private earnest entreaties ( which were as so many Commands to me ) of some Members of Your Honourable Assembly , to undertake this weighty task , & their authorizing my rude Collections for the Press , were such strong exciting engagements to me to undertake this difficult employment , that I chosen of two extremes , rather to discover mine own insufficiency in and impotent speedy discharge of this great service , so far transcending my weak endowments ; than to show any want of sincerity or industry in deserting this grand Cause in a time of need . It being one chief Article of my belief , ever since I first read the Scriptures , and Tullies Offices ; That I was principally born for my Countries good ( next to Gods glory involved in it ; ) Upon which ground I have ever bent all my Studies to promote it what I might , though to my particular loss and disadvantage . The sole end I aim at in these Treatises , is the re-establishment of my bleeding , expiring Countries endangered Liberties , Privileges , Rights , Laws , Religion , the curing of her mortal wounds , the restauration of her much desired Peace , in truth and righteousness , the supportation of Parliaments ( the only Pillars , Bulwarks of our Church , State , Laws , Liberties , Religion ) in their perfect lustre , and full Sovereign Authority ; the removal of those present grievances , differences , Wars , ( arising principally from ignorant or wilful mistakes of the Parliaments just Privileges and the Kings due Prerogatives ) which threaten present ruin to them all ; for whose future prosperity , security I could ( withExod . 32. 32. Moses , andRom , 9. 4. Paul ) heartily wish my self to be blotted out of the Book of life , and to be accursed from Christ ; neither count I may life , limbs , liberties , or any earthly comforts deer unto me , so I may any ways promote Gods glory and the public welfare . And certainly had the most of men in public places , but Heroic public Spirits , ( as I make no doubt all Your Honours have ) biased with no private Interests , or base self-respects , studying nothing but the common-good , our present unnatural wars would soon be determined , our greatest differences easily reconciled , our foreign Irish , French , Walloon Popish Forces , brought in to cut our English Protestants and their Religions throats , before our faces , ( at which horrid spectacle I wonder all English spirits rise not up with unanimous indignation in stead of joining with them ) easily expulsed , our remaining Grievances speedily redressed , our disordered Church Reformed , our Pristine Peace and Prosperity restored , yea entailed to us and our Posterities for ever ; whereas the private self-ends , self-interests , of some ambitious , covetous , malicious , treacherous , timorous public persons , ( who serve no other Deity , Majesty , or Republic , but themselves alone ) have most shamefully embroiled , betrayed , and endangered both our Kingdoms , Parliaments , Liberties , Religion , Properties , yea , all the blessings we formerly enjoyed ; whose names and memories shall be ever execrable to all Posterity upon Earth , & their Souls , Bodies , eternally tortured in hell , ( without repentance ) for this their inhumane , unchristian Treachery , and Realm-destroying , Church-subverting selfseeking , detestable both to God and Men . To conjure down such base degenerous private spirits to the infernal pit , or else to elevate and inflame them with great heroic public thoughts , there is nothing more effectual ( in my weak apprehension ) than the well-grounded knowledge , serious study , and full vindication of such public Truths , concerning Public Government , and the Sovereign Jurisdiction of Parliaments , Kingdoms , Magistrates , People as are here debated , ratified , freed from those black aspersions of sedition , faction , rebellion , treason , conspiracy , mutiny , singularity , disloyalty , and the like , which sordid Sycophants , selfseeking Monopolists , Courtiers , Royalists , or malignant Delinquents , have most injuriously cast upon them to delude the world ; which long obscured Truths , though they may seem dangerous Paradoxes , and upstart Enthusiasms , at the first proposal , to many ignorant , seduced Souls , kept over long in Cymmerian darkness , by those Egyptian taskmasters , who have studied to increase and perpetuate their bondage ; Yet upon serious examination will prove to be most ancient , indubitable Verities , universally received , believed , practised , by most Realms and Nations in the Universe , from the beginning of Monarchy till this present ; and the contrary received opinions , to be but the vain , empty Brainsick lying fancies of a few illiterate , impolitic Court-Chaplaines , Lawyers , Sycophants , who never dived into the Principles Constitutions , Laws , Histories of States and Realms , or into the true original grounds of Regal , Regnall , Popular , or Parliamentary Jurisdictions ; and writ only to flatter Princes , to purchase honour , gain , or favour to themselves ; without any respect at all to Verity , or the Common good , which never entered into their narrow private thoughts . What entertainment these New-published common Truths , are like to find in Court , and elsewhere among many men , I may easily conjecture by that ingrate requital Your Honours have received from them , for all your faithfulness , pains , cost , diligence , service for the Public safety . Never did any Parliament in England deserve half so well as this , for their indefatigable labours night and day , almost three whole years space together , for the Common good : Yet never was any half so ill requited . Never did any demerit greater public applause ; never any underwent half so many vile Libellous reproaches , slanders , of all sorts , even for welldoing ; and that not only in vulgar Discourses , but in Press and Pulpit too . Never did Parliament in any age fit half so long , or do half that work , or get any such public establishment , as this ; and yet all our Parliaments put together , were never so much opposed , traduced , secretly conspired against , or openly assaulted with armed violence to dissolve and ruin them , as this one alone ; against whom not only the Pope with all his Antichristian Members , at home and abroad , but ( which is almost a Miracle , not formerly herd of in any age ) both King , Queen , Prince , Privy Counsellors , Courtiers ; yea diverse Nobles , and Members of both Houses , contrary to their own Protestations , have utterly deserted it , yea bent all their policies , wits , Forces together , to dissolve and null it , ( and in it all future Parliaments , ) as no Parliament at all , but as and Assembly of obstinate refractory Traitors , and Rebels ; when as all your Actions , Proceedings , Declarations , Protestations , proclaim you nothing less , yea the best-deserving Parliamentary Assembly that ever this Nation was blessed with , and those Heroic Champions , who have lately regained , resettled ( as far as humane Laws and Ordinances can secure them ) our lost , at least decayed Liberties , Laws , Privileges , Religion , in despite of all oppositions , and utterly suppressed that confederated Triumvirate ( of the Counsel-chamber , Starchamber , and High-Commission ) which had almost enthralled us in more than Egyptian bondage , and resolved to detain both us and our Posterity under it , without the least hope's of any enfranchisement . Never were there half so many public regal Protestations , Declarations , Proclamations , Oaths , Remonstrances , solemnly made and published to the world , for the inviolable preservation of all just Rights and Privileges of Parliament , as there have been in this ; and yet never were there so many apparent violations of the undoubted Rights and Privileges of Parliament in all former ages whatsoever , as in this one Parliament only , now at last so far affronted , by open Proclamation , ( even against and Act of Parliament , passed by the King and both Houses when fullest , ) to be Proclaimed to the world , No Parliament at all , but a mere factious , seditious Conventicle . Which how inconsistent it is with other former Oaths & Protestations , let all wise men judge . However ; this may be some good encouragement to your Honours , and My self too , that if all his Majesties solemn Printed Protestations , Oaths , Proclamations , Remonstrances to his people and all the world , with deepest imprecations on himself and his Posterity , to maintain the Laws and Liberties of the Subject , the just Privileges and power of Parliaments , and Protestant Religion to the utterrmost , be as cordially , as really intended , as they are pretended , your Honourable proceedings , and these my polemical Discourses ( really defending , vindicating , the indubitable Privileges of Parliaments , the Subject's Liberties , Laws , and our Religion against all Opposites whatsoever , ) cannot but find most gracious acceptation with his Majesties own person , yea , with all his Counsellors , Courtiers , Cavaliers , who bear any sincere affection either to the Parliaments Privileges , their Countries Liberties , or Religion : which all doubt and Army of English ; Irish , Outlanding Papists , will hardly fight for , or maintain , but really subvert , if possible . However , Your Honours kind , favourable entertainment , and Noble Patronage , of these my unworthy public Labours ( of which I cannot doubt ) accompanied with the consciousness of my own sincerity and loyalty , in the whole contexture of them ( though some out of malice , envy , or flattery may and will misconstrue them , as they have done other of my Writings , to my great damage and danger ) shall be a sufficient Sanctuary to secure both Me and them , against all adverse Powers and Detractions whatsoever : and if I chance to suffer any future hard measure , of what kind soever , for doing my Country or Your Honours the best and faithfullest service I am able , I shall repute it my greatest honour , my chiefest felicity , and cheerfully undergo it ( through Gods assistance ) not as a Cross of infamy , but a Crown of Glory : And so much the rather , because your Honours have formerly taken up this Magnanimous resolution , yea sealed it with solemn public Cove • ants and Protestations , to live and die in the just defence of your Privileges , Country , and Religion , ( never so much endangered , banded against by foreign and domestic Papists , Atheists , as now ) and never to desert them while you have one drop of blood in your veins , or any breath in your Nostrils : and God forbid , but that I , and all other true Members of our State and Church , should cordially concur with you in this Heroical Covenant , which the desperate See Romes Masterpeece Confederacies of our Romish Adversaries , long prosecuted among us , and now almost promoted to perfection , have necessarily engaged Your Honours and the whole Kingdom to enter into , for their Preservation . Now the God of Peace , and Lord of Hosts , be ever mightily present with , and in Your Honourable Assembly , to counsel , direct , protect , prosper all your sincere endeavours to promote his Gospel , Truth , Honour , the public welfare , liberty , tranquillity , security of our endangered lacerated Church and Realms , Isay 33. 20. Till the Lord shall look mercifully upon Zion , the City of our solemnities , and till our eyes shall see our English Jerusalem , a quiet habitation , a tabernacle that shall not be taken down , not one of the stakes whereof shall ever be removed , neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken , notwithstanding all the mighty oppositions against it : And till youIsay 58. 12. shall have built up the old waste places ; raised up the Foundations of many generations , yea erected the veryZach . 4 7. Topstone of and exact universal Ecclesiastical and civil Reformation in Church and State , with shoutings , crying Grace , grace unto it . That so all future Generations may really bless , and call you , The Repairers of our manifold breaches , the Restorers of Paths to dwell lin . Which is , and shall be the daily prayer of Your Honours most affectionately devoted Servant , to live and die with You in the Common Cause of God , Religion , and our Native Country , WILLIAM PRYNNE .
