TO The true Heroine Lady , the Lady DOROTHY SYDNEY , The HEROINAE are humbly p •• scented by G. RIVERS , To receive Fame from her Favour . Madam , THat I approach so fair a Shrine with so course and Offering ; accuse not my unworthiness , but your own worth ; which like a Loadstar is pleased to attract the coursest mettle , to make known her power . Were it not a profanation to sunder that symmetry of Virtue and Beauty , ( pieces , of which you are the whole , and which worthily beget wonder and love ▪ I might aspire to level praises to some few particulars : but since such a disunion cannot be made by a weak pen without cracking or disordering that • goodliest frame of Nature ; Madam you must give me leave only to admire you in great , as the great Subject of all admiration . If in writing You , I fallen short of sense ; it is Love : if I overreach it ; it is Wonder : so is sense and language oppressed ▪ or heightened by the subject that admits no mean . Madam , if this Pamphlet of You rise in the opinion of the World , it is You ; if it fallen , it is I ; I , that have battered my brains against as great a miracle as the Philosophers stone . If you please to receive it with a favour answerable to the ambition it is offered , I shall account it the greatest honour that can be done to him , in whose esteem ( Madam ) You are the first and last of these Stories ; the unparalleled Lady DOROTHY SYDNEY , the incon parable ARETAPHILA .
