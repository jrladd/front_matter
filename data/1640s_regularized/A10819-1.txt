To the right Honourable MOVNTIOY Earl of Newport , Lord Mountioy , Master of his Majesties Ordnance . Right honourable : THe favourable countenance and furthering Respect which my Predecessors received of that renowned General , and ever memorable and remarkable Martialist the Right Honourable the Earl of Devonshire , of never dying Memory , your Lordship's late deceased Honoured Father , together with the Duty and Oblegiance , all those of my Quality owe unto your Honour ; by reason of the Place and Dignity most deservedly You are in , and called to ; makes me of Socrates Opinion , in acknowledging all my utmost not able to reach the half height of your Lordship's Favour : Wherefore labouring like the Bee , sucking from the choicest Flowers the best Honey I can gather , the night of rest being come , I bring it to the Hive of your kind acceptance , and there leave it , as much labour bestowed about little , till diligent employment may more amply increase it . Right Honourable , I am loath to be troublesome , especially where affable Gentleness out paceth any merit in my Self : Therefore presenting your Lordship with this Treatise of Gunners Art , and my attendant Service , when it shall please your Honour to employ me ; and praying devoutly for the endless prosperity of You , and yours , I humbly conclude Your Honours , in all duty to be commanded . John Roberts .
