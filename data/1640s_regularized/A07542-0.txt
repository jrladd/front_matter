TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , MY VERY good Lord , THOMAS Earl of Winohelsee , etc. RIGHT HON : WHen I had composed these unpolished lines , and being urged by some of my friends , to put them into the wide world , to shift for themselves ; I thought it somewhat and unnatural part , to turn my newborn Muse out of doors harbourless being unknown , lest she should be tossed to and from , with some hollow blast of arrogant breath . Then musing on the many undeserved favours that I have received from your Lordship , which I know not how to requite ; I thought of presenting my homebred Muse to your Honour ; being the first fruits of my poor endeavours in this kind , and as part of the testimony of my humble service in thankfulness to your Lordship . Although somewhat discouraged , when I considered the greatness of your person , together with your worth , and gifts of mind , meeting with learning and piety , which makes you shine as a fixed Star in our English region . And then looking back how unworthy my plain Muse is of your Honours acceptation ; But when I considered again , what small and weak endeavours ( such which might claim kindred with this of mine ) have been accepted of great personages when they have been drawn as a clew from the bowels of love ( which I hope your Lordship conceives no less of mine . ) And the Eagle though she soars aloft , does not disdain to stoop low , and the Sun that is so glorious , does not deny his spangled beams , nor cloud his smiling countenance from these infereour dark bodies here below , and that the noblest spirits are accompanied with the humblest minds ( which I have ever found in your Lordship ) then my doubts vanished as the missed before the heat : so I resolved to present ( as here I do ) these lines to your Honours protection , Humbly craving your Lordship's acceptation , that they may bear your name ; So with your Honours countenance , they shall pass secure ; Thus praying that the Lord will enrich you with spiritual blessings , and that the due of heaven may sweeten the fatness of the earth , to you and your noble offspring forever . And remain your Honours most humble Servant : HUMPHRY MILL .
