To the Right HONOURABLE THE Houſe of Peers Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT . Right Honourable , THis plain Sermon , when preached , was entertained by Your Lordship's with ſingular attention ; and now comes to public view by Your command . I ſhall not preſume now to make another trial of Your patience , by a long Epiſtle , as I did then in a long Sermon : I only preſent it unto You , and ( ſince You pleaſe to have it ſo ) to the eye of the World , humbly beſeeching the Lord to accompany it with his bleſſing , that all who read it , ( eſpecially Your Lordship's ) may in it behold , as in a Glass , the Glory of the Lord , and be changed into the ſame Image by the Spirit of the Lord ; thatſo they may account it their greateſt Honour to promote this Work ; to beautify the place of Gods Sanctuary , Eſa . 60. 13. and to make the place of his feet glorious . So prayeth Your unworthy Servant , Stephen Marshal .
