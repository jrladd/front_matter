To the glorious object of our expe ••• CHARLES Prince of WALES When subject's bring presents to their Princes , it's not because their Princes want them ; but that subject's want better ways to express the bounty of their unknown affections ; I know your Highness wants not the best means that all the world affords , to ground and perfect you in all those Princely Qualities , which befit the hopeful Son of such a royal Father ; yet the boldness of my zeal is such , that nothing can call back mine arm , or stay the progress of my Quill , whose emulous desire comes short of none in the expressions of most loyal and un •• igned affection . To which end , I have presumed to consecrate these few lines to your illustrious Name , as Rudiments to ripen ( and they will ripen ) with your growing youth , if they but feel the Sunshine of your gracious eye . My service in this subject were much too early for your Princely view , did not your apprehension as much transcend the greenesse of your years ; the forwardness of whose Spring thrusts forth these hasty leaves , Your Highness is the expectation of the present Age , and the point of future Hope's : and cursed be he that both with Pen and Prayers shall not be studious to advantage such a high prized Blessing : Live long our Prince : And when your royal Father shall convert his • Regal Diadem into a Crown of Glory , inherit his Virtues with his Throne and prove another Phoenix to succeeding Generations : So Prayed for , and Prophesied , by Your Highness most Loyal and most Humble servant , FRA . QUARLES .
