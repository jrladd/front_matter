TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDWARD SOMMERSET LORD HERBERT , Baron Beaufort , of Gresmond , Earl of Glamorgan , Son and Heir apparent to the most Honourable HENRY Marques of VVorcester . RIGHT HONOURABLE , It's a principle of Nature , that Creatures of weak condition , aiming at security , do direct their course for shelter , to the wings of the more potent , so Principalities and states of inferior note , do manifest their solicitude , to gain the patronage of some Royal Majesty : This little work by reason of its means , dares not adventure to be exposed to the public censure , unless it be protected under the Sceptre of Honourable Authority ; and whither shall it betake it self , if not to your Honour , whom God hath established on Earth , as a particular image of his glory : assuredly the rays of honour originally issuing from your countenance , the general esteem of your unparaleld worth , and your matchless zeal and Christian fortitude in your weighty undertakings , are no less arguments of your incomparable merit , then incentives to the learned , to adorn their Chronicles with the lustre of your deserts ; The subject of this small work being drawn from the historical records of Foreign countries , and fitly appliable to the distempers of this kingdom , may the rather be admitted to the favour of your noble patronage , forasmuch as your Honour out of the generosity of your nature , have been pleased with a glance of real compassion to view and survey the model of its sad afflictions , having with unspeakable toil , charges , and dangers adventured hither ( not unlike to NOAH'S Dove , with and Olive branch of Peace ) to appease the raging fury of our intestine harms ; This enriching the Diadem of your renown with a particular Jewel of rare merit , are not these issues and offspring of a boiling & bleeding heart , boiling with impregnable love and loyalty unto his Majesty , and bleeding for the continual distempers of his kingdoms . Pardon then Right Honourable the Authors presumption , who making humble remonstrance of his real observance & duest respects , builds not upon the worth of this subject , but wholly relies on the favour of your noble acceptance , assuring himself , the characters of your name engraven upon its frontispice will not only impart a particular lustre unto it , but will ( moreover ) yield it accaptable to all readers : Why then , as the glittering beams of your unspotted loyalty ( true effects of a generous heart ) have given a full reflection on the dark brow of this distracted age , so posterity hereafter may bless , praise , and admire , your zealous noble undertakings , whose felicity can never equalise the hearty wishes of Your Honours most humble and most obsequious servant , HENRY BVRKHEAD .
