To the Right honourable GEORGE , Lord Berkley , Baron of Berkley , Mowbray , Segrave , and Bruce , and Knight of the Noble Order of the BATH . My LORD : I Do here once more present your Lordship , with the fruit of my leisure studies , as a testimony of my readiness to serve you , in those sacred matters , to which I devote my more serious hours . I should not have presumed to this Dedication , had I not been encouraged by that generousness and sweetness of disposition , which does so eminently adorn your Lordship's place and abilities . If your Lordship please to excuse this boldness , and to vouchsafe this Pamphlet a shelter under your favourable patronage , you shall thereby encourage me in those higher studies , which may be more agreeable to that relation , wherein I stand , as being Your Lordship's servant and Chaplain , I W.
