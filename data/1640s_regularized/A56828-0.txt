TO MY MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN KING CHARLES . SIR , I Believe you to be such a Patron of Virtue , that if this Treatise had the least probability of cherishing Vice , my countenance durst not admit a thought of this dedication to your Majesty . But my own reason ( seconded by better approbations ) assures me , these Disquisitions and Prayers are like to beget grace in those where it was not , and confirm it where it was . And being so useful , I dare not doubt your patronage of this Child , which survives a Father whose utmost abilities were ( till death darkened that great light in his soul ) sacrificed to your service . But , if I could question your willing protection of it , I might strengthen my petition for it , by and unquestionable commendation of the Authors published meditations , in most of which ( even those of Poetry begun in his youth ) there are such tinctures of Piety , and Pictures of devout passion , as gained him much love , and many Noble friends . One of that number ( which is not to be numbered ) was the Religious , Learned , Peaceable , humble Bishop of Armagh ; whom I beseech God to bless , and make your Majesty and him , in these bad , sad times , instruments of good to this distracted , distempered Church and State . This is my unfeigned prayer : and I doubt not but all that wish well to Sion will seal it with their Amen . Your Majesties poor and most faithful Subject , RICHARD ROYSTON .
