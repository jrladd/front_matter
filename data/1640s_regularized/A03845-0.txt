TO THE MOST VERTVOVS MY MOST HONOURED LADY , THE LADY ANNE WENTWORTH , Eldest Daughter To the Right Honourable the Earl of Strafford , Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . MADAM , IT is not needful , I should use many words , to let You know , that this Book belongs to Your Ladyship , It sufficing that You know , I am Yours , ( since You gave me the liberty , to call my self so , when I had the Honour to be admitted into the House of my Lord Your Father , where my Parents did introduce me , and where I have profited near You and my Lady Arabella Your Sister , as in a School of Virtue ) whence it follows , that Jonely give You that which is Yours , being found in me : and though it should be otherwise , I could not present it to any one , that deserved it better then Your self . The reading of this Epitome , MADAM , which I dedicate unto You , as being Yours , and which I put to light under Your protection , will represent ARGENIS unto You , as the Fairest , most Virtuous , and Constant Princess of Her time . And I have thought , reading this History , that I have seen Your true portraiture in the person of this Fair Lady . For , making a Parallel of this Princess with Your Honour I find You very suitable ; yea I can witness with truth , that You surpass Her : since that beside the Beauty of the Body wherewith Nature hath endowed You ; You are also enriched with that of the Soul beyond measure ; and as touching Virtue whereof You are a Pattern , You excel Her , being Virtue it self . You have beside the knowledge of the True GOD , which is the Ground and Basis thereof , and whereof our ARGENIS was ignorant ; and as for Constancy , You have not ( I dare say , ) Your equal , seeing You are resolved , to be conformable unto the Will of GOD , and of my Lord Your Father . To which may be added Your Birth ( as well as unto our ARGENIS ) which makes You truly worthy to bear the Pearled Crown , wherewith my Lord Your Father hath been Honoured , without asking or intercession ; but by the Kings only Will , who gave it Him for His eminent Virtue and good Services ; being of the number of those of whom the French Proverb makes mention ; saying , TELL DEMAND ASSEZ , QUI BIEN SERT . And to conclude MADAM , I say , that-even as it hath pleased GOD , to fill our ARGENIS with Joy and Content , giving Her , Her POLIARCHUS , as the most Complete Prince of the Earth , He may send You for Your , and Your most Honourable Parents Comfort , a Husband worthy of You , And I am confident , He will be far Completer then POLIARCHUS . These are the Wishes MADAM , Of your most humble , most affectionate , most obedient , and most obliged servant , Judith Man.
