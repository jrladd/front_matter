TO MY WORTHY AND EVER HONOURED FRIEND , Mr. EDWARD BENLOWES , ESQUIRE . SIR , TO satisfy your desire , I have endeavoured , so far as the shortness of time , the distractions of my mind , and the want of Books would give me leave , in this place of exile , to open the mysteries of this Treatise , so much cried up by those , whose eyes pierce no deeper then the superficies ; and their judgements , then the outsides of things . Expect not here from me Rhetorical flourishes ; I study matter , not words : Good wine needs no bush . Truth is so amiable of her self , that she cares not for curious dressing : Where is most painting , there is least beauty . The Gentleman , who at last acknowledgeth himself to be the Author of this Book , • his • efface . tells us , that many things in it are not to be called unto the rigid test of reason , being delivered Rhetorically : but , as I suspect that friendship , which is set out in too many Verbal Compliments ; so do I that Religion , which is trimmed up with too many Tropical pigments , and Rhetorical dresses . If the gold be pure , why fears it the Touchstone ? The Physician will try the Apothecaries drug , ere he make use of them for his Patients body ; and shall we not try the ingredients of that Religion , which is accounted the physic of our souls ? I have no leisure nor mind here to expatiate my self : a sparkle of the public flame hath taken hold on my estate ; my avocations are diverse , my Books far from me , and I am here Omnibus exhaustus pene casibus , omnium egenus : Therefore accept these sudden and extemporary Animadversions , so earnestly desired by you , as a testimony of his service and love to you , who will always be found Your servant to command , Dum res , & aetas , & Sororum Fila trium patiuntur atra , A.
