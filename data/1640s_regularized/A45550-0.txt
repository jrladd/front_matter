To the Right HONOURABLE Sir JOHN GAYR Knight , LORD MAJOR : The Right Worshipful the Sheriffs , and the rest of the Aldermen . Together with the Worshipful Societies of this Ancient and most Renowned City of LONDON . Right Honourable , Right Worshipful ; Worshipful : I Should have been well pleased to have kept this scarce plumed Bird in my private Cage , had not the noise of some virulent Fowlers shot forced her to fly abroad for Refuge ; where to built her Nest better she knew not , then in the secure clefts of your favourable protection . In your ears she first sounded her notes , which ( though harsh and broken ) were attentively herd by many among you ; and I hope will now be entertained no less acceptably . True it is , she is no soaring Eagle in cloudy Notions , nor gaudy Peacock beautified with the Feathers of affected Eloquence : only thus much I may safely say , she is and harmless Dove , free from the Gall of Malicious Bitterness , bringing in her mouth like that of NOAHS , the Olive Branch of peaceful Unity . To the effecting and establishing whereof , that she may prove in some measure subservient , is the hearty desire and unfeigned prayer of him who is A constant Petitioner at the Throne of Grace for yours , and the Churches safety . Nathanael Hardy .
