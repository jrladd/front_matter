TO THE HONOURABLE AND THE MOST WORTHY MECAENAS , SIR John Winter Knight , Secretary of State , and Master of Requests to the Queens most excellent Majesty . HONOURED SIR , THe confidence I have of your Native goodness ( of which the World is sufficient Dilater ) has prompt me to this audacious presumption , which with some would have been held a crime insufferable . But I know your Honour is so far from a Censurer , that you had rather cherish endeavours then destroy they : Beside , there's a certain Sect of self-affecters , that will ( unless some judicious Patron be fixed to the fronts-piece , as the beams of the Sun , to correct their saucy peering , with blindness ) not only disgorge their Envy , but wrest the sense to be succinct ; I ( knowing your Name to be such , as among the discerning Spirits deserves the highest Attributes of worth ; and of such singular power , it'll extirp the Malevolent thoughts that reign in the vulgar and most infectious Traducers ) tender this , as my first Sacrifice , at the Altar of your mercy . And if it may obtain the reflection of your acceptance , it'll so much encourage your poor Admirer , that I shall be Ambitious in the continuance of your favours : These are the Maiden-blosoms of my Muse , which ( without your protection ) may ( in their infancy ) be destroyed by the breath of Zo√Ølus ; but sheltered by your Honour , they shall live , and dare the Critics rancour , retorting to their own shame . Sir , the fostering this Orphan will make you famous for Charity , and impose and obligation beyond expression , upon Your Honours truly devoted , JO . TATHAM .
