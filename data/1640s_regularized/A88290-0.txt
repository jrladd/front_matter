To his truly Honoured Friend , Maſter JOHN THOMPSON , of the City of LONDON Merchant . SIR , AS in thoſe more painful employments you formerly underwent in Tranſmarine parts you did with great fidelity , courage , and induſtry for ſundry years , manage the affairs of our Engliſh Merchant's entrusted to your care and diſcretion : So now in this your preſent retirement , your continual Study makes it manifeſt , you act not the part of a young man ( though your years speak you not aged ) but like a wiſe man ( that ever husbands Time with advantage ) You enrich your mind with Knowledge , Converſe amongſt Studies , and with Authors of wisdom , that hereafter you may be more ſerviceable to your Country as opportunity ſhall preſent you with a fit occaſion : I ſhall not need acquaint the World , that you have ( as we ſay changed heaven ) and lived not further then five degrees from the Aequinoctial ; yet have you ſtill remained your self , and twice returned Statu quo , bettered by your travels . This little Treatiſe ( of less worth then I wiſh it ) I preſent unto you , and deſire your perusal by way of Recreation , ( I am not ſingular in Dedicating a ſmall thing to a worthy Friend : Iohn Dee a moſt Learned man Dedicated his Aphorisms to Gerard Mercator a man famous , and they conſiſted of less then ſixe ſheets . ) Wearied I ſay with more weighty Studies , run over this , and the rather , becauſe its the firſt in this kind ever wrote by any : and you can judge whither it's well or ill done , and few elſe : Your self have seen it in lose papers , from the beginning , middle , and to the end of it , are able to testify its my own , I borrowed it from no man , ( that impertinent Traveller spoke by Authority , who hoodwinked in judgement , bleated openly that others performed my Work , yet he never ſaw me . ) Sir , Favour me with as much love in Receiving it humanely , as I in Affection tender it unto You , and You engage me to reſt , Your Real Friend , WILLIAM LILLY .
