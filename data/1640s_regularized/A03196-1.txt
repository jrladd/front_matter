TO THE EXCELLENTLY DISPOSED MISTRIS ELIZABETH THE VERTVOVS CONSORT OF CLOVILL TANFIELD OF COPT-FOLD HALL , IN ESSEX ( Esquire . ) The memorable Acts of these nine most worthy Ladies are humbly presented by T. H. Excellent Creature , THat I presume to approach so fair a shrine with so mean and offering , accept not ( I pray ) my unworthiness but your own worthy deservings ; borrowing your unspotted name to usher in these nine most incomparable Ladies ; neither is it improper , but rather material , for modesty and chastity best accommodates magnanimity & courage ; all virtual decorements consists not in masculine spirited Viragoes , some of your sex being for their beauty beloved , some again more for their inward virtues , then outward features affected ; as virgins for their chaste and modest endowments ; wives for the love and care they have to preserve their conjugal tie untainted , some widow's for their wisdom , and grave matrons for their gravity ; now in this miscellany of your so much magnified sex , where you shall find one excellently pollisht ; it is in your choice to make her your president ; or if any for too much boldness branded , you may use her as a veil to make your own virtues show the more conspicuous , for contrarieties in colors best sets off each others luster ; thus after a particular acknowledgment of my duty and service , with pardon craved for my too much boldness I remain yours . In all observance obliged , Tho. Haywood .
