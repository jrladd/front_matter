To the Right Honourable WILLIAM Earl of New-Castle , etc. Governor to the Prince his Highness . My LORD ! YOur favourable Construction of my poor Labours commanded my Service to your Honour , and , in that , betrayed your worth to this Dedication : I am not ignorant how far unworthy my best endeavours are of your least allowacne ; yet let your Lordship be pleased to know you , in this , share but the inconveniences of the most renowned Princes as you partake of their glories : And I doubt not , but it will more divulge your noble Disposition to the World , when it is known you can freely pardon and Officious trespass against your Goodness . Caesar had never been commended for his Clemency , had there not occasion been offered , wherein he might show , how willingly he could forgive : I shall thank my Fortune , if this weak presentation of mine shall any way increase the Glory of your Name among Good Men , which is the chiefest aim and only study of Your Honour • … devo • … ed servant . Richard Brome .
