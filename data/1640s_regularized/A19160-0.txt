To the Right Honourable EDWARD Lord Viscount CONWAY and KILLULTAH ; Baron of RAGLEY ; Lord Marshal of the Army , and Privy Counselor of IRELAND ; and one of the Counsel of War to His MAIESTY of GREAT BRITTAINE . MY LORD , THis Stranger , who hath newly learned the English Tongue , dares not venture himself in Public , without a Patronage ; which , with all humbleness , he intreats of Your Lordship . The great Affection , Your Lordship hath shown to the Spanish Language ; and the Benignity , wherewith You are pleased to entertain whatsoever relisheth of Art , or Ingenuity ; makes him hope , You will not refuse Your Favour and Protection to one of that Nation . Nor knows he , where to shelter himself with so much safety ; the Eminence of Your Person , and Judgement , being of power to secure him , from all petulant and malicious Exceptions . Be pleased then , my Lord , to receive him with Favour : So may those Excellent , and Natural Beauty's of this happy Isle ( who shall have either Health or Pleasure , from this Confection ) be ever serene , and grateful to Your Lordship ; presaging increase of Honour , and all Felicity , answerable to the humble Devotion , and hearty Prayers of Your Lordship's most obedient , and obliged Servant DONE Diego V'ades-forte .
