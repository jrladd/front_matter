TO HIS EVER-HONOURED , NOBLE , KIND FRIENDS , THE Right Honourable Lord Ferdinando Fairfax , the Right Worshipful , Sir William Waller , and Sir William Bruerton , Knights , Commanders in Chief , of the Parliaments Forces , in several Counties . Deſervedly Renowned Worthies , YOUR Incomparable Valour , Zeal , Activity , Induſtry for the preſervation of Your Deareſt Country , Religion , Laws , Liberties , and the very being of Parliaments , all now endangered by and unnatural generation of Popiſh and Malignant Vipers , lately riſen up in Arms againſt them in diverſe parts of this Realm ; and thoſe many miraculous Victories with which God hath been lately pleaſed to Crown your cordial endeavours , to promote his glory and the Public ſafety , as they have justly demerited ſome grateful general Acknowledgements from the whole Repreſentative Body of the State ; ſo they may in ſome ſort challenge a private gratulatory Retribution from Me , who have formerly had the happiness to participate in your Chriſtian Affections , and now reap much Conſolation by your Heroic Actions . Having therefore ſeaſonably finiſhed this Third part , Of the Sovereign Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms ; copiouſly Vindicating , the Lawfulness , Justness of the Parliaments preſent Neceſſary Defenſive War ( in which you have had the Honour to be employed , not only as Chief , but which is more , as moſt successful Commanders , in your several Countries , ) in point both of Law and Conſcience ; and fully wiping off thoſe black Aſperſions , of TREASON and REBELLION , which the oppoſite party ( really guilty of theſe crimes againſt both King and Kingdom , as I havePart 1. Edit . 2 p. 108 , to 1. 12. elſewhere manifeſted , and here lightly touched ) have out of Malice , Ignorance , or both conjoined , moſt injuriouſly caſt upon your Loyal , honourable proceedings , which rejoice the souls of all true Philopaters , who cordially affect their Country or Religion ; I could not , without much ingratitude , yea injuſtice , have publiſhed it to the world , but under the Patronage of your ever-honored reſplendent names , who have ſo valorouſly , ſo successfully pleaded this Cauſe already in the Field , that it needs the less aſsiſtance from the Press . My many inevitable interruptions and straits of time in its contexture , which may happily detract ſomething from its perfection ; ſhall I hope , derogate nothing from your Honourable , Friendly acceptation ; whom I have thus conjoined in the Dedication ; becauſe the Parliament hath united you in their preſent Warlike employments , and God himself jointly honoured you with success , even to admiration among the Good , indignation amid Malignants , envy with the Malicious , and , I truſt , to and active ſedulous emulation in all your Fellow Commanders , employed in other Quarters in the selfsame Cauſe . Your preſent busy public , and mine own private Employments , prohibit me to expatiate ; Wherefore earneſtly beſeeching the Glorious Lord of Hoſts to be ever mightily preſent with your several Noble Perſons , Forces , and to make you always eminently , active , Valorous , Victorious , as hitherto he hath done , till Peace and Truth , Tranquillity and Piety , by your several triumphant Proceedings , ſhall once more lovingly embrace and kiss each other in our divided unreformed , sinful Kingdoms ; And till the effect of theſe juſt wars You manage , ſhall be quietness and aſſurance to us and our Poſterities after us for ever ; I humbly recommend your Perſons , Proceedings to his protection who can ſecure you in and from all dangers of war , and reſt , Your Honours , Worſhips moſt affectionate Friend and Servant , WILLIAM PRYNNE .
