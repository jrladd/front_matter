TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL SIR IOHN LENTHALL Knight , Marshal of the Kings-bench . SIR , IT is not unknown to the World , the great ear , earnest , sedulity & laudable custom that hath always been observed in all ages for the preservation of antiquities ; by means whereof , the acts and occurrences of former times are so clearly demonstrated , as if they were manifested to the world by a perfect and lively representation , which affords in it self a double profit , does thereby allure all well-disposed persons to the imitation of those things which are honest and virtuous , and to the evitation of such things as are evil and obnoxious , letting them thereby understand the happy issue and success of the one , and the miserable and wretched end and event of the other : for histories are as so many Records and Registers of matters that hath been already past , which being a thing that our humane nature's are much inclined unto , gives a great pleasure and delight in the reading : Especially to those that are well affected to the same . The consideration hereof hath moved me to revive that which hath for a long time been raked up in the embers of oblivion . For there coming by chance into my hand a book long since printed , the author whereof was that famous and learned Knight Sir Thomas Moore , sometime Lord Chancellor of England ; wherein is set forth the short Reign , and unfortunate death of the two young Princes , Edward the fith , & the them Duke of York his brother , with the troublesome and tyrannical government of usurping Richard the third , and his miserable end , both which for the matter of the subject , & the worth of the Author ( who lived in those times ) deserves to be memorized to succeeding ages ; which having for many years escaped the press , and by that means likely to be utterly lost , I have thought it not amiss to put to my helping hand , for the restoring of it to the world ; and because I know you to be a gentleman that delights your self in matters of this nature , I am bold to crave your patronage herein , and that you would be pleased to shelter it under the wings of your protect on , not doubting but by that means , it will be as welcome to the world , and as well entertained , as it hath formerly been , which being the thing I wish , together with your pardon for this my presumption , I humbly rest Yours to Command , W. S.
