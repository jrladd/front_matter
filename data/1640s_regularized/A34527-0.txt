To the Honourable House of COMMONS , now assembled In PARLIAMENT . THe same reason which first moved me to undertake this work , makes me now such as it is to publish it , Obedience to this Honourable House : which did then answer those discouraging arguments of my great imperfections , the want of my study , my little acquaintance in practical Divinity , And does still excuse me in any thing else but Sin. For I have taught my eyes to read much Divinity in men command , I can deny my self to serve my Superiors ; Indeed the voice of God makes me deaf to Humane Institutions : And when Heaven speaks , I do not understand the language of the World : Disobedience in such a case is Devotion , and the greatest Rebel , the best Christian . If not other motive could subdue my thoughts to this belief , S. Paul is plain and positive in my Text , showing the vanity & deceiptfulnesse of all the Creature's excellency : the power , weakness ; the riches , poverty ; the wisdom , folly : That God alone is power , and riches , and wisdom , and all things . And surely this argument deserves the severest study , the most holy Meditations of every child of Adam , and therefore cannot be unwelcome to a great Council of wise Senators , who have received a large measure , a full cup of Divine Providence , and inspight of Room continue successful . In which discourse I proceed as much as my memory would give leave by example , and matter of fact , which brings the Conclusion to our bosoms , and is more working than speculation . The unskilfulness of the pen I hope will not take off from the power of the subject , the rude clothing cannot more offend the eye than the precious body may affect the heart . In which assurance I remain Your unworthy servant EDW . CORBEETT .
