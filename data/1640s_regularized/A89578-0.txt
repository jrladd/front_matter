TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT . YOur time is ſo taken up with the important Work of reſcuing theſe bleeding Kingdoms , and the Church of Chriſt in and with them , that I am ſure you are not at leiſure to read long Epiſtles ; and were I able in a Dedication to write what might very much kindle your zeal , provoke your whole inward man , and thereby further your great Work ; I conceive it were only to tell the world what counsel I thought might do you good ; and therefore in ſtead of ſtudying to preſent you with and Epiſtle , which few of you would read , I do only obey your Order , and at your Command publiſh to the view , and for the uſe of all , and preſent unto your ſelves this plain Sermon , Preached unto you upon the day of your late Thankſgiving unto God for one of the greateſt mercies ( the Victory , and what came with it duly conſidered ) that God hath beſtowed upon our unworthy Nation theſe many years . What elſe I deſire to have preſſed upon your hearts , I choose to do it when I am called at any time to Preach unto you , or rather to beg it for you at the Throne of Grace ; where you , and your great Work are every day ( as by many thouſand others ) humbly remembered by Your moſt obliged Servant STEPHEN MARSHALL .
