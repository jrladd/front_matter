To the truly Noble , and Virtuous Lady , The Lady Nevill Brook . Madame , BEhold my one weeks Meditation , which is yours all the year ; so I presume it may not come unseasonable to you now , though that dolorous time be passed , and a more joyful one ensued ▪ Even so it is , by the way of sorrow , we must arrive to joy , which none in the next life can perfectly participate of with our Saviour Christ , without part of his pain and sufferings in this , Though not by Passion , yet by Compassion at least ▪ So , where the effect wants , if the will want not , it is sufficient . You ( Madam ) are ( we know ) of more Eminency of Fortune , then to feel the one , but of such Eminent devotion , as the other you are not without tender feeling of , which makes me with more Confidence , approach this to your fair hands , who yield to none , in truly honouring you , RICH : FLECKNOI 〈1 page duplicate〉 〈1 page duplicate〉
