TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , Sir EDWARD LITTLETON , KNIGHT , Baron Littleton of Mounslowe , Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of ENGLAND , AND One of his Majesties most Honourable Privy COVNCELL ; Grace & Peace be multiplied . Right Honourable , MAY it please you in these troublesome days of ours , to behold the man , who though ( with open mouth ) he telleth not all things that every one hath done , Yet ( by lively example ) teaches what every one ought to be ready to do ; Even for Kings , and for all that are in Authority ; that we may led a quiet and peaceable life , in all godliness , and honesty . His Person , whilst he lived , wanted not the love and favour of a King , to advance him to dignity ; & let not this Posthume work of his lack your Honours protection and patronage , to keep it from indignity . A Midwives care reaches no further than the safe bringing the Infant into the world , the maintenance and protection thereof , she commends to the Father and other Friends . This Orphan by my means hath happily seen the Light , but wanting a Father , as being deceased before his birth , I presume to commend its defence and tuition to your Honour as a friend , & your Lordships self to the gracious protection of the Lord , who grant you ever the continuance of your honour , to you and your posterity for ever : So prayeth Your Honours humbly devoted I.G.
