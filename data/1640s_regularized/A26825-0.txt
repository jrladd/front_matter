For the Right Honourable , LORDS the Peers , and Gentlemen of the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS . THe Author , as to the firſt part of his Animadverſions touching the late motions of the State , in the viſible purſuance of Arbytrary power , preſents them not as news to a Court of Parliament , the evidence whereof being obvious to all the world , only he ranks them here in a new file , for ſatisfaction of the incredulous Malignant , not capable to owane his own friends , neither will be ſenſible what your indefatigable labours have been , or take notice of the pains you have taken , during theſe foure years , for Preſervation of the common freedom and liberties of the Kingdom . As to the ſecond part , which is a narrative , touching the War under the conduct of major General Laughorns , it is offered to all of diſcerning Judgements , how mirakculouſly Gods special providence hath evidently appeared as well in that particular of the County of Pembrook as in the General proſperity of the Kingdoms arms . The concluſive part , is both humbly monotory and petitionary , that , that poor deſſolated County , with the parts adjacent may be timely taken into your compaſsionate conſideration , and ſuch a ſpeedy courſe taken therein as may beſt ſuit with your preſent great and urgent affairs : The inveterate feuds and dissensions of this County , hath been a great hindrance to the public ſervice , and if not timely composed , may be of a more dangerous conſequence The diſtreſſed condition whereof ( through Gerrards cruelties ) is truly laid open unto you ; as alſo the way of this Counties repair ( in ſome competent meaſure ) humbly preſented in a few Propoſitions , which may both rectify the many grievances and dissensions of this County , together , with the diſorder of the Soldier ; without other charging the State , or farther troubling , your important Conſultations , otherwiſe , then in your timely deſignation of ſome honeſt and able Gentlemen , ( as your Commiſſioners , to examine all grievances , eſpecially in the behalf of ſuch , as have ſuffered in the loss of their whole eſtates in the public ſervice , and are at preſent reduced to extreme want and penury , the care whereof in all humbleness is deſired and left to your pious providence , leaſt the conſtant party there ſhould be utterly disheartened , and at ſuch time , as there may be preſent uſe of their farther ſervice , ſince probable it is , that the Iriſh Rebels ( on their late victory ) may thruſt over ſuch Forces into that County and Milford - Haven , as may turn the Skales of your Victories here ( if not timely prevented , by guarding thoſe Coaſts with a ſtrong Fleet , ) both the Welch Nation , and Engliſh Malignants in the general ( howſoever now maſtered ) retaining ſtill their wonted hearts , may in all likelihood on all occaſions join with the ſtrongeſt . And thus in all humility hath the Author taken the boldness to preſent unto your wiſdoms the whole ſcope of his poor endeavours , and humbly craves farther leave to concludewith the Oracles of two great Princes , wiſhing , that they may profit ſuch , as they moſt concern . The ſtrength of a King is the preſervation of the State , King James his Speech in Parliament , 1609. the foundation thereof , is the people , and woe unto them , which divides the weal of a King from that of the Kingdom . How guilty the Delinquent and malignant party have been in the fomentation of the preſent divisions , the appeal is made to their own Conſciences , which have moſt unnaturally invaded the people in their repreſentative , and have endeavoured to deprive both King and Kingdom of their great Council . Aequius eſt me tot , 〈 … 〉 & talium amicorum conſilium , quam tot & tales , meam unius voluntatem ſequi . How averſe His Majeſties great heart hath been in following the veſtigia of this famous Emperor and how fatal to himself , let 3. ruined Kingdoms be the Arbiters , and his own conſcience the faithful umpier . Your moſt conſtant and faithful Servant , Gil : Batt :
