To the right Reverend , the faithful Ministers of GODS Word of the Church of Scotland . RIGHT REVEREND , IT pleased You in the General Assembly last , at Edinburgh , Anno 1647. to take to your consideration , the great utility the Church of GOD may have by the Songs contained in holy Scriptures ; After due deliberation , it pleased You to ordain that I should labour in that work â–ª In obedience unto You , I have endeavoured to come as near to the Text as was possible for me to do ; And those my labours I in all humility offer to be considered , by the most learned and most judicious Brothers , that the Church having the use thereof , may in obedience to the Apostles precept Ephes. 5. 18. in Psalms , and Hymns , and spiritual Songs , make melody in their heart to the Lord , whom I entreat in all humility to direct You in all things by his holy Spirit ; So I remain From Glasgow , the 27 of February , 1648. Your humble servant in the LORD , M. ZACHARY BOYD .
