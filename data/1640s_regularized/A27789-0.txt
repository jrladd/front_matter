TO The High and Honourable Court OF PARLIAMENT . And Epigram . GReat Senators , I owe devoutest prayers , For both the Houses honourable chairs , Their Order furthering these Psalm-affairs . I know not yet , what friendship god between Hath set me down so far behind the screen , That scarce enough I may be herd or seen . But if I can appear , I may appeal , And venture something for the Churches weal , In some case it is capital to conceal . I dare not parley , but I dare protest , I aim God should be served with the best ; The judgement is referred to your breast . Your beams are bright , and day light does appear , The text and the translation both are here ; Judge by the clock of your judicious ear . Then cherish virtue with a gracious face . If either do excel , give that the place ; If both have done alike , give both their grace . So shall great Academies crown our brows , With learned laurel : And they shall allow's To voice your votes , & say y'have paid your vows . Great Chronicles shall also blaze your Name , And set it burning in a lamp of fame , Guilding your just acts with its shining flame .
