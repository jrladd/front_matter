TO The most Religious , and Noble Lady , the Countess of Argyle , etc. MADAME , THis world is full of people , whose religion is compounded like the TURKISH , in part CHRISTIAN , in part IEVV , in part WORLDLING , in part ATHEIST , in part as A grippa , almost Christians : Only these are happy , who according to the Apostle his wish , Act. 26 29. are altogether Christians . A time of trial will come , which shall discern almost from altogether : Happy shall these professors be , to whom the Lord shall say , Luke 22 28. Ye are these which have continued with me in my temptations ; and I appoint unto you a kingdom , vers . 29. as my Father hath appointed unto me , vers . 30. that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; of all honours this shall be found the greatest . GOD , Madame , hath highly honoured your La. both with grace and place : As for grace , ye may without flattery , with S. Iohns Lady , be called the ELECT LADY : 2 Iohn 1 As for place , Ye both by birth and marriage are high , but highest in this , that your La. art humble . I will not here enter into a large discourse , concerning the Noble and Potent Earl your La. Husband , whose virtues have most Oriently shined in our general Assembly , which his Lordship did much honour with his presence , and help with his counsel . That which the Apostle did require for the house of Onesiphorus , that I most heartily wish to his Lordship , to your La. and to all your noble Line and Familie,2 Tim. 1.18 . that the Lord grant that ye may find mercy of the Lord in that day . Let it please your La. graciously to accept of this little labour , and to honour it with your favour , it shall be but and EARNEST of more , if I live , and if God permit . From Glasgow the 14. of Ianuar , 1639. Your Ladyships in all humble duty and observance M. ZACHARY BOYD
