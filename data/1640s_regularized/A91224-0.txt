TO The Right Worshipful his ever Honoured worthy Friend , Sir PHILIP CARTERET Knight , Lieutenant Governor and Bailiff of the Iſle of Jerſy . SIR , Your great Favour and Humanity To Me while Exile , Prisoner in Jerſy , Wholly ſecluded from all Friends access , Under the angry Frowns of their Greatness Who ſent Me thither , to deprive me quite Of worldly Comforts ; challenge a juſt Right To theſe rude Meditations , which there grew , And ſo in Juſtice are your proper Endue . Accept them than , as a ſmall Pledge of my Thanks unto You , till Opportunity And better Days , enable me to find , Some other means to pay all that's behind . Your Eternally Obliged Friend and Servant WILLIAM PRYNNE .
