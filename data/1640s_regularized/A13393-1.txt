To the honoured Patron of his Book . SIR , AS my service binds me and my love , ( May your fair self so of the same approve ) As your deservings , I have placed you here Equal with Phoebus in his Hemisphere , Where your refulgent brightness cast's a light Into these twinkling Lamps , and give's them sighed . Minerva bade me tell you she is proud Of those deserts which in your breast do crowd As in a throng , which our capacity Not able to find out , leave's to her eye . Thrice worthy Hero , may your Halcion days Be never extinct till crazy Time decays . Jo. Tatham .
