TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE , CHARLES PRINCE OF VVALES , DUKE OF CORNWALL , and Earl of CHESTER . SIR , IT hath pleased your Highness to command this Sermon to the Press , and me to be your ſervant : what you have observed from either , that might incline you to ſo much grace & favour , I know not ; unless it were my plain dealing with the Times . This ( indeed ) your Highness mentioned with a deep sense and reliſh . Would God the mad world knew it . Certainly it were enough to ſtop the foul mouths of ſome : enough to warm the honeſt hearts of others . God Almighty ſo compoſe the preſent troubles of this State , that the Government thereof may ſtand the ſurer for this ſhaking ; and continue and increaſe his graces in you for the glorious ſupport thereof , when it shall pleaſe him to lay it upon your ſhoulders . Thus prays Your Highneſſes moſt obliged humble ſervant , JOHN BERKENHEAD .
