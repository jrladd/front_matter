TO THE MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE , CHARLES , PRINCE OF WALES , Heir-apparent to the Monarchy of Great Britaine , etc. Most Illustrious Sir , I Doubt not your Closet already abounds ▪ and is daily replenished , with volumes of English History , as those Mirrors , in whose Reflections your Royal Ancestors , you may best discover Theirs , and direct your own Actions . I therefore humbly address this piece to your Highness , not as a Book , but as and Index , which cannot offer the Pomp of • a Volume ▪ yet may yield the profit of a Manual . The work is Posthumus , bereaved both of the Author and protection ; and had it not desired to live under the Patronage of so clement a Prince , was willing to die in the Cradle , rather then be exposed to theadventures of a distempered Age . I refer its merits to the judgement of the Public ( to whose use it affords it self , ) but humbly begs , that being and Orphan , its Fatherless condition may find succour and countenance from the splendour of your goodness , under which it hath been first brought • orth into the world . Vouchsafe • therefore ( Great Prince ) to cast a gracious Eye on this deserted • Object , and the poor Oblation of Your most humbly devoted servant and Subject HENRY SEILE .
