To the High and Mighty Monarch CHARLES By the Grace of God , of Great Brittain , France , and Ireland , King , etc. SIR , BEing filled with and admiration of your Royal parts , and a declaratory Fame of the Virtues and heroic Actions of your Fame worthy Progenitors ; and those transmitted unto You , by a successive Lineal and Hereditary right , so that that rare Conjunction of Castor and Pollux , I mean Majestas & ortu & Art , are both happily conjoined in your most Sacred Personage . The curious survey of the multitude of your Princely parts breed in me a number of desires so that I have adventured to break the barren soil of my poor portion ; that prosperous success should rather want to my endeavours , then diligent endeavours to my loyal determination . My submissive allegiance to Your Royal and Heroic Virtues , have been and encouraging cause to desire Your Majesties gracious Patronage of this little Treatise of Gunners Art ; but how my unworthiness may hope of your Goodness , I cannot find but in the Notes of Your transcendent and gracious Disposition . Thus in the lowest humility of allegiance , I offer both my self , and the employment of my undeserving Service freely to your Highness acceptance , and do desire both to be and appear to be Your Majesties humblest and most devoted servant , Iohn Roberts .
