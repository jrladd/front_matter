TO THE NOBLE LADY , D. Anne Campbell ; Daughter to the Noble and Potent Earl , the Earl of Argyle , etc. MADAME , I Here humbly dedicate unto your Ladyship , now of tender years these two compends of the Catechism . Saint Iohn , the Cusin , and beloved Disciple of Iesus Christ , who for his high doctrine was compared to and Eagle that mounts very high , disdained not to write unto Children . In one chapter of a short Epistle he hath ▪ I write unto you little children ; 1 Joh. 2 12 ▪ vers . 13 and again in the same words , I write unto you little children ; of that his writing he gives two reasons ; the one is in these words , because your sins are forgiven you for his Names sake ; the other reason is in these words , because ye have known the Father : For this end , Madame , have I written unto you these two compends , that ye may know the Father ; whom I most humbly entreat to increase his graces begun in your Ladyship in a good measure ▪ From Glasgow the 19. of Ianuar , 1639. Your Ladyships most humble Servant , M. ZACHARY BOYD .
