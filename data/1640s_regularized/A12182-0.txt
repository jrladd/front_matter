TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDVVARD , Viscount MANDEVILL and his LADY ANNE , his Pious Consort , increase of GRACE . Right Honourable , A Pious Christian while upon earth , takes his time to do his task , he is or would be , all in grace , and all to duty ; well knowing that the time is short , the work great , the wages sure ; and that the best improvement of parts and talents will bring in the master the greatest advantage , and himself the present and most lasting comforts : This is the fruit of a well led life , to advance God in glory and a Christian in comfort : such as serve God in fulfilling his will must to heaven , carry their graces with them , enter into their master's joy , & if they be eminent in profession or public in place , leave behind them their example , or some other monument to the world of their fidelity in their places ; happy such servants that can thus employ their times and improve their talents : This was the endeavour of that shining , and burning lamp D. Sibbs the author of this work which I now make bold to present unto your Honours ; such holy and useful truths were delivered by him in his life time , that the judicious conceive , may prove very profitable unto the Church , being published after his death ; I conceive thus of the man ; what he did in his ministry in public , or in his conference in private , it was done aptly , pithily and profitably ; his art was to hide his art , & Artis est celare artem . to say much in few words ; he did not desire to cloud his matter from his hearers , or to walk so long about any one text , till errors were vented , or his auditors tired ; you shall find him to be himself & one constant to his own principles , all along the treatise ; here you have no new errors broached , or old truths deserted , but opened maintained and honoured , the glory of teachers , expectation of hearers , and recompense of readers . Having found this to be your Honours honour ( and let it still be ) to content your selves with humble knowledge , cordial respect & vital expressions of received truths , that you are not in number with those that change their judgments , ( and I fear their religion ) as they do their friends and fashions ; being constant in inconstancy , and that with you it is not , truths Non ex personis probamus fidem , sed ex fide personas , Tertul. for persons , but persons for truth . I doubt not the admittance of these Sermons unto your respect & patronage ; my only request is , that as the author did honour you , so these labours of his ( now made public ) may be as so many divine beams , holy breathings , and celestial droppings , to raise up your spirits to hate the dominion of the Beast , to help forward the ruin of mystical Jericho , and all other Unprosperous buildings , and builders ; that you may become Successful seekers , gaining faith Triumphant , to acquaint you with the Hidden life , that at length you may obtain the redemption of your bodies , knowing that Balaams wish is not enough , unless the faithful Covenanter take you into covenant with himself , this alone yielding to you the demand of a good conscience , which shall be your defence against the Sword of reproach . These I leave with you , and you with God , and rest , Your Honours at command , IOHN SEDGVVICK .
