To the Right Worshipful , Sir FRANCIS PILE Baronet , Sampſon Bound wishes plentiful increaſe of spiritual gifts , health confirmed , and life prolonged , etc. IF that ( much honoured Sir ) I ſhould here prefix any long narration in commendation of your Worth , I ſhould of ſome be ſuſpected of flattery ; of all it would seem a thing ſuperfluous , ſeeing it ſufficiently commends it self ? ſuch is your Worth , that who ſo readeth you throughout , cannot but entertain honourable and pious thoughts of you : your deſerts of Gods Church , your ſingular zeal , your unfeigned faith , your ſincere profeſsion , your especial care to advance Gods glory , and to root out Papiſtry , your conſtant faithfulness to your King and Parliament , hath been ſuch , that this Kingdom generally , but the County of Berks eſpecially ( your native soil ) have and ſhall have great cauſe to bless God for you ; hoping yet better and greater things ; and that their hope's may meet with fruition , they have jointly with one heart and tongue choſen you , ( being worthy double honour ) Knight of the shire ; and which juſtly ſpeaks obſervation , no negative voice herd ; which clearly proclaims to the world , your ſenſible goodness and deſerts for the time passed ; Their great and glorious hope , that the Lord will make You and instrumental Bleſſing , not only to the whole Realm , but eſpecially to them anam their County , for the future . Now , that this expectation may come into their hands , you have the tongues and hearts of all ; of all , except ſome few of Nadabs and Abihu's ſect , ſuch as offer often times ſtrange fire upon Gods Altar ; they indeed breath out flames endeavouring to sing and ſearch you , your viſible goodness , and apparent virtues : o , what will not Ignorance and Malice , ( eſpecially if infected with our Kingdoms new diſeaſe ) dare attempt ? what ſpeech of wisdom can be ſo diſcreetly uttered , but it may by Ignorance be depraved ? what actium of virtue can be ſo exactly performed , but it may through Malice be misconstrued ? It is not more proper to God to bring light one of darkness , than it is natural for the Devil and his turbulent Imps out of the light of truth to endeavour to draw darkness of error , and out of the beſt ſpeeches and actions to strain and force out ſomewhat , to maintain and nouriſh their corrupt humours and bosom sins . And what marvel ? ſith even in Paradiſe amid the ſweeteſt flowers and herbs a Serpent could live ▪ and find there ſomething to feed upon , turning the 〈 ◊ 〉 of thoſe sovereign and meddle ſhall ſimples into poison ; but expelling theſe , I haſten unto that whereof I am chiefly to speak . I am , honoured Sir , as full of hope as deſire , that your countenance will help into the light , this bashful piece of my compoſure ? your Affection , and more then common kindness unto me hath emboldened me to beſeech that you will Patroni • e this firſt fruit of my endeavours ; as I ſhall not here remember all the favours wherewith I have been honoured , ſo can I not forget to mention ſome , eſpecially thoſe reflections and gliſſonings ( which in due reſpect to you ) ſhone on me , from that great star lately fallen ( the able and reverend Doctor , the faithful and worthy Prolocutor Maſter William Twiſſe ) as , his laſt judicious and elaborate Book , which he ſo willingly gave me with his own hand ; his thinking me Worthy ( though unworthy ) to ſucceed him as Paſtor of Newbury , ſigned with his own hand ; his giving me the free uſe of his rich and learned Library ; under the Sunſhine of theſe beams ( darted on me ( right Worshipful ) for your ſake ) have I lately lived ; ſo that , it may be expected ſomewhat of mine ſhould be coloured with them . indeed the Argument being and Aſſembly act , might therefore claim a peculiar intereſt in a Prolocutours religious Protection ; but the former cauſes have invited , nay enforced me , humbly to deſire yours : Whoſe protection ſhould I rather beg then his that hath made me happy both in affection and actium ? ſuch is your known goodness , as that it is not only extended to me , but faſtened on all thoſe that ſincerely fear God ( which makes the public Good ) with affections ( like the beams of the Sun ) immutable , unchangeable ; mark the rays of the viſible Sun , how conſtant they are , being not moved at all by the motion of the object , but immoveably flowing from the Body of the Sun , though bluſtering winds tyrannise in the air , and remove it a thouſand times out of his place in and hour , yet the Sun beams keep their object which they enlighten , and stir not at all ; in like manner , your affections ( honoured Sir ) like thc beams of the Sun remain unmoveable where they are once fixed , though bluſtering winds have tyrannized , and toſſed You , your Perſon , your good-name , your moſt godly , moſt humble , and devout Lady , your well-governed Family , your great eſtate , etc. yet your pious heart and religious affections have remained unmoveable ; witness your cheerful conſtancy to your Chriſt and his cauſe from the firſt to the laſt ; this is that which ( more eſpecially ) adds unto my hope's ; nay , its that that makes me confident , that theſe few labours will find a gracious acceptance being humbly preſented to your Indulgency and Gentleness . I conclude , fearing prolixity ; the Lord of Heaven bless you , and grant as you have been heretofore faithful , juſt , and wiſe ; ſo you may continue to the glory of God , the increaſing of his Church , and the profit of his People . Your Worſhips moſt humble and faithful , and in Chriſt at command , SAMPSON BOND .
