TO My moſt Gracious SOVEREIGN King CHARLES . SIR , I Believe you to be ſuch Patron of Virtue , that if this Treatiſe had the leaſt probability of cheriſhing Vice , my Conſcience durſt not admit a thought of this Dedication to your Majeſty . But my own Reaſon ( ſeconded by better approbations ) aſſures me theſe Diſquiſitions and Prayers are like to beget grace in thoſe where it was not , and confirm it where it was . And being ſo useful , I dare not doubt your Patronage of this child , which ſurvives a Father whoſe utmoſt abilities were ( till death darkened that great light in his soul ) ſacrificed to your ſervice . But , if I could queſtion your willing protection of it , I might ſtrengthen my Petition for it , by and unqueſtionable commendation of the Authors published Meditations , in moſt of which ( even thoſe of Poetry begun in his youth ) there are ſuch tinctures of Piety , and Pictures of devout Passion , as gained him much love , and many Noble Friends . One of that number ( which is not to be numbered ) was the Religious , Learned , Peaceable , Humble Biſhop of Armagh ; whom I beſeech God to bless , and make your Majeſty and him , in theſe bad , ſad times , inſtruments of Good to this diſtracted , distempered Church and State . This is my unfeigned Prayer ; and I doubt not but all that wiſh well to Sion , will seal it with their Amen . Your Majeſties Poor and moſt Faithful Subject , RICHARD ROYSTON .
