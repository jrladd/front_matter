TO The Right Honourable the Truly Noble and Renowned ROBERT EARLE OF ESSEX , etc. Illustrious Sir , THE inducements that have swayed me to the Compiling of this Tripartite History , have been , partly , for mine own satisfaction in the survey and prospect of the times and occurrences of the world , coincident , and contemporary with those of the Church : partly , for the satisfaction of the Reader in the same contemplation ; and for the mixture of some delight with that satisfaction , in such a mixture of variety . But chiefly , for both our observation of the hand of God , good and gracious in the preservation and propagation of his Church , and just and avengeful in his indignation and judgements upon those two Nations that persecuted the Church ▪ if they could have done it , to the death , and that executed to the death the Lord of the Church , the Lord of Life : For as there were two Thieves that were crucified with our Saviour , the one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; so were there two worse by far that crucified him , the Iew and the Roman : The former of ignorance , and so shall once obtain mercy ; the latter even against the confession of his innocency , and so shall perish for ever . Both persecutors of the Church , as well as crucifiers of the Lord of it , the Iewes while they continued to be a Nation , the Roman while the Church shall be a Church . The consideration of this very thing , does not only warrant , but even challenge a mixture of study of the Story of these three together , that the footsteps of providence might be traced the more clearly in those two impressions of Mercy and Judgement dispensed in the world , in their contrariety , the former to the Church , and the latter to these two Nations , the enemies and persecutors of her , and of her Lord . I have therefore taken them up in one discourse from that very time that that • se two people did undo themselves , by doing violence to the Lord of Glory ; and for how long a process of time the discourse does carry them on , this volume will speak for the present ; mine intentions aim at a longer extent , if the Lord permit . The Story of the Church I have traced in the Acts of the Apostles , and there have rather set my self to explain and clear what difficulties are in the Text , then to write out the full History and Occurrences that are there related ; for since the Euangelist hath done it with a divine Pen , it was utterly needless , that I may say no more , to redoe it with mine . The times of the Stories there , I have been the more curious to search after , and to settle as near as I can , and to bring into Annals , not only for the profit that arises to the Reader from the knowledge of them ▪ which is not little ; but also for the bringing and reducing of the Story of the other Nation , into a parallel and collateral current and coincidency with them . What difficulty I have met withal in this particular , any one will readily judge that does but observe how sparing the holy Ghost hath been through all that Book , to express the circumstance of the time with the relation of the things . And what I have done towards the fixing of the times in this difficulty , I have tendered under the notion of conjecture , for I could go no further ; yet have I grounded those conjectures upon such reasons , as are much to m • ne own satisfaction in that matter , and so it may be they will be something to others . I have led on the Story in this present piece , but to the end of the Twelfth Chapter ; for thitherto hath the Evangelist that wrote the Book , more especially discoursed the planting of the Church , and the propagation of the Gospel among the Iews . And as for the rest of the Book , from thence to the end , that brings the Church and Gospel among the Gentiles , I have reserved it for another part , if the Lord vouchsa • e life , leisure , and assistance . The customs and carriage of those Apostolic times in Worship and Discipline , I have been sparing in discussing ; for the Text , for as far as this present discourse goes , is sparing in offering occasion to fallen upon such a thing : in that part that is behind , where the Epistles of Paul are to be taken into hand , as they fallen in in time , such considerations will be useful , and they will be inevitable . The Story of the Iewes out of their own Josephus and Philo , Egesippus , and others , the Reader will generally find to be but a Commentary upon their own words , His blood be upon us and upon our children , written even in Letters of their own blood from time to time . For when that perverse and ungodly generation , had so far refused the Gospel , and their own good , that it had crucified the Lord that tendered it to them , ex illo fluere : from that time forward their ruin and decaying is written in all their stories in such Capital Letters , that he that runs may read it , and he that reads them , reads them not , if he do not observe it . This short tract of time that this Volume containeth , will tell you of three or four , or more such Anatomy Lectures in less then twelve years space ; of many , and many thousands of that Nation , that perished and were miserably destroyed in Judea , Alexandria , and Babylonia ; and this but as a Preface and beginning of sorrows and misery's that were to follow in the destruction of the whole Nation , for despising and destroying of him that held out life unto them , but they chosen his and their own death . Some of the same Authors that have given us these prologues of their misery's , will continue the scene with further Tragedies , till their utter extirpation : and we shall borrow and abridgement thereof from them , in the parts succeeding , if the Lord carry us on , and prosper us in that work . And how grateful and excellent a work and pains might it be , if where Josephus and Egesippus end their Story , and where Jerusalem ended her days , thence some learned and industrious pen would out of the Iewes own Talmud and Rabbis , and other writers , continue the story of this dispersed and condemned nation till these later times , for the Illustration of the truth of those predictions of Scripture that foretell their doom , and for the evidencing of that justice that hath ever since haunted them , for the murder of the righteous one whom they crucified . These are the two main things that I look upon in relating those stories that this volume does exhibit ; if the Reader who hath more leisure shall dilate his meditations upon so sad spectacles to further extent , he hath saved my labour , and it may be not loose his own . The Roman History , which is the third that we have to deal withal , I must refer to the Reader to find expressions by which to character and censure it , for I confess I want them : It is so full of truths so horrid and monstrous , ( if I may epithet so glorious a name as truth with so vile and base adjectives ) that it even gluts the eyes and amazes the heart of the Reader , and though he cannot gainsay the truth of the things , yet cannot he tell what to say to them , they are so hideous : such monsters of bloodshed and cruelty , prodigies of lust and bestiality , Gorgons of excess and luxury , and in brief , the very perfections of all viciousness and impiety , that it were most unfit to name them with a Christian story , were they not most fit to prove Gods high displeasure against that Antichristian City : I have taken them up as I have found them in their own Historians , some here , some there , abridged them as much as possible to save what labour I might , and laid them in their proper times according to the d • rection of their own Annalists . Politic or Ethical or other observations upon them I refer to others to make , it is a thing that suited not either with my leisure or my purpose : I only show the monster , every eye desires to look upon such a beast : let them read upon him as their judgement leads them : only this let me mind them to observe , that no small judgments are to be read in so great sins , and that that City is very unlikely to be the head of the Church , that is so visibly the very tail of the Devil . Rome had murdered the Lord of holiness at Jerusalem , and Room wallows in such murders and unholiness at home , and wh • there she be the likelier to be owned by Christ for Zion or Babylon , may any one censure . Now the reason of mine address unto your Honour , most noble Hero , with this my undertaking as and oblation , you may read it in your own worth and nobleness , and you may read it in your relation to mine own native Country : for the one engageth , the other inboldneth , and both overcome me to owe all the service I can to so much worth , to evidence this service by all means I can to so great nobleness , and to hope for acceptance of this what I • and from that relation . Sir , this work is a fruit that grew in your own Staffordshire ( this is the only comfort that is now left to that poor Country that we may call her yours ) it grew with your name and memory upon it at its very first appearing : It hath been in devoting to you all the while it hath been in growing , and now it is come to this maturity , it is doubly yours , as a fruit of your own Country , as a vow of mine own heart : To beg accept • ance were to seem to doubt it , which suspicion your nobleness cannot suffer to nest in me : This only let me beg of your expectance : that whereas mine engagement was and your challenge might be of a work of A second part of the Harmony of the Evangelists . another nature , you will be pleased to interpret , that this hath not prevented that that it should not come forth , but only outrun it , that this might come to do you homage first ; that that is not lost though this be found that is in the womb though this first born . And truly I could not but e • cuse , nay I could not but approve the forwardness of this to outrun his fellow and to get the birthright , when the only aim of it was that it might be your first homager . And I cannot but hope that your Nobleness will gently interpret of this error of observance , as and offence of a most venial nature , when the utmost damage that accrues upon it is but delay , and not detriment , and when the summa totalis of the payment , namely my service is the same , though there be some difference in the coin . It hath been the course of my studies in elaborating the Harmony of the foure Evangelists ; and this history , to let them grow up and thrive together , for me thought there was some equality in the division , to part my studies , betwixt the story of Christ in the Evangelists , and the story of the Church in the Acts of the Apostles , and to make the history of the other two nations my recreation . And I cannot but accordingly be affected with the same method of their production that was of their generation , and allow them their vicissitudes now as they had them then : Your Nobleness will gently dispense with these strivings and contendings where the prize and mastery aimed at , is , which shall first serve you . In your hands I leave this oblation to do you fealty till his fellow come up to him : and in the hands of the Lord I leave your Honour , as in the hands of a faithful Creator and Redeemer , to be kept in welldoing : He bless you with the blessings of the right hand and of his left hand here , and crown you with his bless • dnesse of his presence , and the joys at his right hand hereafter : So ever prayeth Your Honours most devoted servant , JOHN LIGHTFOOTE .
