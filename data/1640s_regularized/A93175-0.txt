To the truly Noble , BERNARD HIDE , Eſquire . Sir , IT will be a long Ambition ſatisfied , if by this , I have the happiness of making my ſelf more known to you , though in the ſame Act I put my ſelf to a bluſh , that I have not a better preſent to excuſe the confidence . If I do look upon you but as you relate to me in the common Intereſt and Fame of your virtues , wherein I ſhare with others , I may be cenſured a bold man , ſince as they are proportioned to me , they are more then equal to the whole deſerts of ſome that write both honour and abilities . But when I conſider that graceful part of your Character , Sweetness , which gives both the Price and Beauty to your other furnitures of Art and Nature , I cannot think my ſelf without capacity of pardon for this application , the well meant tender of my ſervice . They are Papers in themſelves not worth your eye , or to be numbered with thoſe reſerves of wit and learning that wait upon your recreations ; and if they receive entertainment abroad , I ſhall acknowledge it rather a debt which men pay to your Name , then a merit of the Poems ; and if they meet with the frowning world , I have ſubſcribed my own , to be accuſed for them , and this preſumption . Howſoever , if they may enjoy but your ſmile and ſhade , which was the firſt choice of my thoughts , it ſhall encourage me to reach your worth with more suitable imaginations ; till when , give me leave to write my ſelf Your faithful Honourer , JAM . SHIRLEY .
