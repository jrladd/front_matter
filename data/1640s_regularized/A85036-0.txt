TO THE Moſt Sacred , and Reverend ASSEMBLY For the REFORMATION of the CHURCH , now convened by the PARLIAMENT . Moſt Sacred and Reverend Divines , I Have but the thoughts of and Afternoon to ſpread before you ; for I Examined the ſame Pace that I read , that if it were poſſible a Truth might overtake and Error , ere it go too far . It is not a little Encouragement that I may fit like the Prophetess under the Palm tree , under ſuch a Shade as your ſelves , and what weakness ſoever may appear in theſe my Aſſertions : This airing them under your Patronage , will heal them . For ſo they brought forth the ſick into the ſtreets , that at leaſt the ſhadow of Peter might touch ſome of them . Thus have I ſuddenly ſet up my Candle for others to Light their Torch at ; and , I hope , you will pardon me , if my Zeal to the Truth made me ſee Another's faults ſooner then mine Own , Your Servant in Chriſt Ieſus Iohn Saltmarſh .
