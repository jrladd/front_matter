TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL MY MUCH HONOURED friends Sir Thomas Barrington , Sir Gilbert Gerard , Sir William Massam , and Sir Martin Lumley , Knights and Baronets , now honourable Knights of the house of Commons in the high Court of Parliament , Grace and peace with increase of all bl • ssings temporal and etern • ll . Right Worshipful , THat undeserved favour and respect which I have found at your hands , and the due respect which I owe to your religious families , do oblige me to show some testimony of my thankfulness , And because I have no better present at this time , but this Treatise of Gods external Works , composed out of Sermons heretofore preached to mine own little flock , and in the troublesome time of my late bonds brought into this form . I must crave pardon for my boldness in presuming to offer it to your hands ; seeing persons of higher place have defamed , and branded these and the rest of my Sermons preached for diverse years last passed , with the reproachful name of factious and seditious doctrines ; and by their grievous accusations have caused me to be shut up as the great troubler of the City wherein I live , and kept in sure hold lest this my manner of preaching might prove dangerous , and a cause of much hurt , and many troubles in these changeable and doubtful times . From these and such crimes and unjust accusations as I have in part purged and cleared my self already in a legal way ; so by your help and favour I hope ere long to be openly acquitted and justified before the world . If you shall be pleased to cast a favourable eye upon these my poor labours , and to take a view of them . I doubt not but the precious matter being Gods pure word , will abundantly recompense the failing of the composer , and the defects of his skill and workman-Wherfore humbly craving your kind acceptance of this small token of love , and slender acknowledgement of duty and service ; and desiring to become more indebted to you , by your favourable respect showed thereunto ; I commend your worthy persons and religious families to the grace and blessing of the Almighty whose invisible majesty , even his divine power and Godhead is clearly seen from the Creation of the world ( which is in this Treatise plainly described ) and understood by the things created . Yours in all Christian duty and service GEORGE WALKER .
