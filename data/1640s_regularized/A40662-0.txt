TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY DALKEITH , LADY GOVERNESSE TO HER HIGHNESSE THE PRINCESSE HENRIETTA . Madam , IT is unsafe , in these dangerous days , for any to go abroad , without a Convoy , or at the least a Pass : My Book hath both , in being dedicated to your Honour . The Apostle 1 Cor. 9.7 . says , Who plants a Vineyard & eateth not of the Fruit thereof ? I am one of your Honours planting , and could heartily wish , that the fruit I bring forth , were worthy to be tasted by your judicious Palate . However , accept these grapes , if not for their Goodness , for their Novelty : Though not sweetest rellisht , they are soonest ripe , being the First Fruits of Exeter Press , presented unto you . And if ever my Ingratitude should forget my Obligations to your Honour , these Black Lines will turn Read , and blush his unworthiness that wrote them . In this Pamphlet your Ladyshippe shall Praise , whatsoever you are pleased but to Pardon . But I am Tedious , for your Honour can spare no more minutes from looking on a better Book , Her Infant Highness , committed to your Charge . Was ever more hope of worth in a less Volume ? But O! how excellently will the same , in due time , be set forth , seeing the Paper is so pure , and your Ladyship the Overseer to Correct the Press . The Continuance and increase of whose happiness here , and hereafter is desired in his daily Devotions , who rests Your Honours in all Christian Service . THO . FVLLER .
