TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM Lord Viscount Say , and Seal , Master of his Highness Court of Wards and Liveries , and one of his Majesties most Honourable Privy Counsel . Most Honoured Lord , I Should not have the boldness to present this book unto your Lordship , if ( beside the great service I owe you ) the Argument of the Book did not invite me to it : for consisting of Politic Discourses and considerations of State ; it is most fit to be presented to Counsellors of State ; among which I knew not whom better to present it to , then to your Lordship : and no less then the Argument of the Book , the Author thereof invites me to it ; for being a learned Lord of Jtaly , none more fit to entertain him then some learned Lord of England ; of which number this Kingdom affords none more eminent then your Lordship : I must not speak so much as I think , for offending the modesty of your ear ; but I may boldly speak so much as all the world sees ; that nature and Art have joined together , to make you perfect in your place , which is to be a faithful Counselor to the King , and a loving Patriot to your Country : for both which , if I should not my self acknowledge and obligation to you , I might worthily be thought , unworthy to be accounted , which I specially desire to be , Your Lordship's humble and devoted servant , RICHARD WHITAKER .
