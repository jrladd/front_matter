TO THE WORSHIPFUL his very Worthy Friend , RICHARD KNIGHTLEY ESQUIRE . Worthy Sir , MY purpose was , that ( without any addition or alteration ) this small Treatise should have passed , as I had formerly composed it : but finding somewhat that I judged useful , to the easier attaining of the Art , which before was omitted ; at the request of diverse of good judgement , I was persuaded rather to adventure the breach of that promise , than to conceal that which might be useful to many . The manifold engagements I stand in to your Worship , require a better retribution ; but your favourable aspect to one as little deserving , hath enboldned me to crave of your Worship to countenance this , and the rather because your experience in the Art , hath already encouraged many to the study of it . I dare not so much injure your Worships virtuous inclination , as to fear the acceptance of this poor expression of my thankefullnesse , seeing it is not unknown to your Worship , nor to many thousands beside , that it hath been instrumental for the good of the Church , and the perpetuating the memories ( as the smell of Lebanon ) of many worthy men , who , though they now rest from their labours , and their works have followed them : yet by this means the fruit of their labours is continued with us . I desire your Worship to pardon my boldness ; and to pray for the increase of all blessings on your Worship , shall be the employment of Your Worships to be commanded , THOUGH . SHELTON .
