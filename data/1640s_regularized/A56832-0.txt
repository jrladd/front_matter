To the Honest-hearted READER . READER , IHere protest before the Searcher of all hearts , that I have no End , either of Faction , or Relation in this ensuing Treatise . I am no Papist , no Sectary , but a true Lover of Reformation & Peace : My Pen declines all bitterness of Spirit ; all deceitfulness of heart ; and I may safely , in this particular , with saint PAVL , say , I speak the truth in Christ and lie not , my Conscience bearing me witness in the holy Ghost , that I neither walk nor write in craftiness , nor handle the holy Scriptures deceitfully : Therefore if thy Cause be Iesus Christ , in the name of Iesus Christ , I adjure thee to lay aside all wilful ignorance , all prejudice , all private respects and Interests , and all uncharitable censures : Deal faithfully with thy Soul , and suffer wholesome admonitions : Search the several Scriptures herein contained , and where they open a Gate , climb not thou over a Style , Consult with Reason herein exercised , and where it finds a mouth , find thou and ear : And let Truth prosper , though thou perish ; and let God be glorified , although in thy Confusion .
