To his much honoured and moſt Worthy friend Mr John Ethredge , Bachelor of Divinity , and Vicar of Halſted in Eſſex . Reverend Sir , I Am bold to preſent to your favourable acceptance and friendly patronage this worthy tranſlation of Ovids Feſtivals . I will beg no pardon for my preſumption herein , for that were to traduce a friendly office , and to queſtion the candour of your ingenuous diſpoſition . To you I commit this orphan Muſe , which cannot die with the deceaſed Parent , but under your grave protection will grow up and flouriſh and wreſtle with eternity . To my knowledge , the Author of this Tranſlation in the ſincerity of his beſt affection always honoured you , and I am confident that out of the engagements of thoſe reſpects he bore you , had dedicated this his enſuing work unto you , had Fate lent him longer life , as a pledge and teſtimony of his undiſſembled love . To you therefore , moſt worthy Sir , I ſend this his learned Poſthume , which humbly imploreth your ſmile upon it and care over it , and that you would lovingly take it into the bosom of your courtesy and there cheriſh it . In ſo doing you ſhall engage the devoted gratitude of thoſe friends it hath , and satisfy the earneſt requeſt of Your moſt reſpective friend Edward Albiſton .
