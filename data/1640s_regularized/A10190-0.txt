TO THE HIGH AND HONOURABLE COURT OF PARLIAMENT , THE NOBILITIE AND GENTRIE NOW Assembled in both the Houses , Grace , Mercy and Peace be multiplied . MOST Noble Senare , and right worthy Pattiots , who both fear your GOD , and honour your King ; He who truly honours you , and daily prays for a blessed success of this your Meeting , humbly presents you here with a Cause , which well weighed in your maturest judgements , may prove one of those greatest Parliament Businesses , which your most pious and prudent thoughts and Consultations are taken up withal . When you have perused this short Discourse concerning Prelatical Authority , whence it is , and if it shall appear by clear evidence of Scripture , justly compared with their Prelatical properties , and practises , that they are the Seed of Antichrist , the Mystery of Iniquity ; a more then Heathenish Tyranny over Souls , bodies , and estates ; a mere enmity ( but under the veil of Hypoerisie ) against Christ , against his Word , against his Ministers , against his People , and the Salvation of their Soulee ; yea against the peace and prosperity of Civil States , by their Factious and Seditious practises , and the like : Your Wisdom , your Piety , your Zeal for GOD , your Love to Christ , your Loyalty to your King , your tender compassion towards your poor Country , your Christian care of your own Souls , and of your Posterities , will all of them call and cry for a serious Consultation , and a speedy resolution what is to be done herein , as you shall apprehend the Prosperity , or Calamity of this whole Church and State , and the happy or miserable issues of Parlliaments to depend upon it . A word to the wise . What I would further say , I will turn into continual Supplication to the Great President of Counsels JESUS CHRIST , that he will send his Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding , the Spirit of Council and Might , the Spirit of Knowledge , and the Fear of the Lord : that Antichrists throne being quite cast out , and Christs alone set up , the King may be established in perpetual Peace and Prosperity to himself and Royal Posterity , till the coming of Him , who shall put and end to Times and Kingdoms ; and with whom all that truly serve him here , shall reign for evermore . Your Honours and Worships faithful Orator till death .
