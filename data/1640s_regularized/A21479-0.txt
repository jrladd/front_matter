To his more than Honoured Uncle Adam Lawrence : Leonard Lawrence wishes increase of happiness , with the Years of Nestor . Sir , WHen first I Translated this small Treatise of Arnalte and Lucenda , I was Resolved to have tendered it to Your Honoured view , fairly written in a well-penned Manuscript : but since that time my Resolutions are altered , yet not somuch through my own desires , as by the persuasion of some wellwishing friends ; who earnest to have some Copies of ( I must confess ) these my weak Endeavours , encouraged me to send it to the Press , thereby to avoid the tediousness of writing : To these their motions I was easily persuaded , and that the rather , because my Subject had formerly been a Printed Object : ( though in another tongue ) Yet I protest no vain ambition , no fantastic desire , to be perspicuous to the transparent eye of the world incited me , but only the importunity of friends : this I hope will excuse my forwardness , either to Your worthy self , or any indifferent Reader ; the ingenious I am sure will encourage my resolutions ; and as for the Hidra-headed multitude , let them spit the venom of their malicious Envy , and spare not ; for I have already prevented the operation of their poison , with and Antidote of sufficient worth , which is , my neglect of such Critical dispositions : and if this be not sufficient , why the two Capital Letters of Your ever-honoured name , is of force enough to confound them with amazement . For which reason , I knowing it to be customary to such as write Books , to Dedicate their Labours to some one or other ; some tendering their Works to the view of Grand-Personages , ( I will not say in hope of reward ) others to their special friends , ( perhaps in respect of love and familiarity ) yet both ( I am confident ( with intent , that they may be set forth to the perspicuous eye of the world ; have chosen Your most respected Self , to Patronise my post-ensuing Lines ; not knowing any so worthy , or more judicious , or to whom I am more obliged . Or have I dared to tender them to the acceptance of any other , sith they are Yours , and You may justly claim them , I having Devoted all my Services to Your Candid self . These if You deign to protect , I'll not care for Carping Momus , or Barking Zoylus , though they should tax me with a Westminsterian Epitaph : albeit I confess I was never such a pretender to Learning ( though I know not much ) as to steal whole Verses , though it be lawful to Quack-salve Lame Lines with helping words , and two Physicians use one and the selfsame Simples ( though differently Compounded ) but to write Verbatim , I'de not affront any men ingenium , so ignobly , or dishonour my self so basely , though thousands know it not : one may come with Virgils Verse in his mouth , and say , Hos ego versiculos feci , tulit alter honores . But's no matter , such Censurers may use their freedom , I will not say of ignorance or envy , if of either I care not : It's Your Honoured self , whom I observe : so you be pleased , it imports not who's offended . My Genius having prompt me to present these unpolished Lines to Your judicious Censure ; I shall entreat You'd pardon the faults my English Style affords ; and attribute them to my unskilfulness ; I must confess ( and believe ) there be many , yet since more sublimer Wits have had some , mine may be the more excusable ; for if the finest Lawn have and Iron-mould , ( witness Your self ) it may be born withal in a courser piece . But what need I direct the freeness of Your Noble Disposition , or the generosity of your superexcellent mind , since the Transcendency of Your judgement , manifests that you'll have this consideration ; that a small hair cannot give so great a shadow as a big Cable , nor a Needles point , so large a circumference as a wide Circle . I need not unfold th'aenigma of my meaning , Car , au , bon entendeur ne fault que demy parolle . As Painters draw a Counter-Figies by a living Object ; so have I enterprised to translate a Book , being a Printed Subject ; yet if I give not a true resemblance , or lay my shadows right , representing th'Idea of my Prose , though Metamorphized into Verse , impute it to my want of Art , not of Desire : Thus , if you please to protect these my employments , which kept my Wits busy for some spare hours , from the taxations of false-opinionate men , whose Critical Censures I may compare to Paris Darts , or Cephalus Shafts , which transpierce the best Armour of proof , though of Vulcans own forging . I'll promise , when as I am grown more cunning , and can mix my colours better , to Present You with some more serious Piece : In the interim I , tendering these to Your protection , recommend You to the tuition of the Universal Rector , who Felicitate all Your Enterprizes ; while I , with all respect , and submissive Reverence , humbly kiss Your hands , and remain in hope of the continuance of Your Favours , Your wellwishing , and most affectionate Nephew : Leonard Lawrence .
