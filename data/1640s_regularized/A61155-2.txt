To the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount SAY and SEAL , and Lieutenant General CROMWEL . Noble Patriots , IF I miſtake not , you may here ſingle out something of the Lords from what is mine , and discern ſome beams of God amongſt many things of man . I know the candle of the Lord cannot ſhine any where with more ſnuff then in me ; however ſince the Lord hath lighted it , I dare not but let it ſhine ( or rather glimmer ) before men . I have writ your Names to my Book that I may be one of your Remembrancers amongſt the reſt to the advancement of Truth ; not but they who know you , know you to be acted by a Spirit of Truth in your ſelves . The Lord remember you according to all the good you have done ( in your several Miniſtrations ) to this people ; and do that for you which gives you moſt , and yet takes moſt from you , even filling you with himſelf ; till he hath emptied you of all but his own glory , and gathered you up into the fullness and righteousness of himself in Chriſt , where we are only nothing in our ſelves , and every thing in him ; and ſurely the moſt , and beſt and greateſt thing he can do for the ſons of men , is , thus to make them nothing in their own account , that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord . I may seem ſtrange to wiſh you thus ; but I know it is not ſtrange to you , who know the Myſtery of the Spirit , and of Chriſt . My Lord , and Sir , Go on ſtill , yet ſtill laying your designs in a glory above that of States and Kingdoms , and involving all your Counſels there , where there is moſt of Heaven , and leaſt of the world . So prays , Your Servant in the Lord , IOHN SALTMARSH .
