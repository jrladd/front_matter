TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES , PRINCE OF GREAT BRITAIN . Moſt excellent Sir , DRawing my breath every day more happily by the favour I received from Your Royal Father , if my Pen ſhould forget You , it had more Ink then either allegiance , or loyalty , or duty : The Eyes that I here preſent Your . Highness , I confess durſt not look his Majesty in the Face ; He hath ſo much of Caeſar about Him as ſtrikes me into a non poſſum far fulmen : but Your Self , being yet a divine ſpark and ray from Him , and not aſcended Your Meridian of Sovereignty , is not become ſo awful , nor ſo inacceſsible . We may ſee that Sun in his Riſing , whoſe Beams may at his Noon chide our weak eyes for the attempt : This Sir I speak of You , who is but now in Your Eaſt , having Your Noone-point before You , and may You drive on happily to Your glory both in Your Heaven and Kingdom below , and the Kingdom of Heaven above . And be pleaſed , Gracious Sir , to let theſe Eyes here light but a beam of Yours to the holy Scripture , and to air but Your Bosom at theſe Flames , and to ſuffer theſe Leaves , thus ſeeded with divine thoughts , to be a robe of holy Ermins to Your Soul : I lay my self and papers at Your Royal feet , and am A Beadsman for Your Highness J. Saltmarſhe .
