TO THE GROWING GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN , The hope's of our Crown , and the crown of our Hope's Prince Charles , At his Court in Caesaria , by vulgar contraction called IERSEY . SIR , I Present your Highness with the Life of your Royal Oncle of France , A successful and triumphant King both at home and abroad throughout the whole course of his Reign , and that , in so constant a degree , as if Fortune herself had been his Companion , and Victory , his Handmaid : They attended Him over the Alps ; They ushered Him over the Pyreneys ; They were his Harbingers over the Rhine , and they brought his horses to drink of the Danube ; They were his Pilots at Sea , and they filled his sails upon the Ocean , where he was incomparably more powerful then all his Progenitors . Nor would I adventure to expose thus to the present world , and transmit to future Ages the Reign of a For ▪ rein King , had not I been Spectator of diverse of his exploits ( and had occasion also to make my address to his Cardinal ; ) for the rest , I have laboured to gather as faithful instructions and authentic notes as I could , and those not upon lose trust or from light persons ; The Relations , which are the ingredients of this Story , were not taken at the Porters lodge , but above stairs , and most of them from the Counsel Table , and Courts of Parliament . This Victorious King began to bear Arms and wear buff , about the same years that your Highness did , for before he was thirteen , He suppressed in person two Insurrections in Poitou , and Britany ▪ He quelled diverse more , which at last turned to his advantage , as we find great trees growing towards their full consistence , corroborat and take firmer rooting being shaken with tempests , by the resistance they make : So by debelling so many civil commotions he came to find his own strength the more , and to be feared as well as beloved of his Subject's , and a mixture of these two passion make and excellent government ; For though the strongest Citadel of a King be his Peoples love , and their hearts his best Exchequer , yet it is observed , that Love without Fear commonly turns to Scorn , and Fear without Love turns into Hatred . In the perusal of this Royal Story , if Your Highness please to observe the circumstances and grounds of some intestine broils , You shall find that diverse of them have a near analogy with these of England , for many grew from discontents , that the great Convention of the three Estates was discontinued , and that France adhered to Spanish Counsels , with other resemblances beside ; Of these and other kind of commotions there happened above ten in this Kings Reign : Nor is it any news to hear that France , hath such fits of distemper , or indeed any Country else , that labours with superfluous humours , I mean that swells with excess of people and plenty ; for as the Natural body when it is too repleat must have some vent , just so , the Political , must have some Evacuations at home or abroad when it is too full , and will thrive the better upon't afterwards . If we cast our eyes upon the great world we shall find restless motions , reluctations and combatings between the Elements ; yet we cannot call this any incongruity or disorder in the frame of things , but it tends to the conservation of the whole , and may be said to keep Nature herself in actium and health ; That the Earth trembleth , the Sea tumbleth , that the Air is always in agitation , that it's rend with thunder , coruscations , and other Meteorological impressions ; that all the Elements are in and incessant feud , it is for the Universal good , and to keep things vigorous , and fresh ; So in Man who is the microcosm , the little world , and made up of elements , there be passion and humours which are in perpetual reluctance within him , and so break out into tumults , preliations , and war ; And where this war is well grounded , it's wholesome , and the victories that are acquired thereby , are Decreta Caeli , the Decrees of Heaven , but in and ill grounded war they are no other then Faelicia Scelera , fortunate villainies : Moreover , to transcend the Elements , if we mark the course of the heavenly bodies themselves , there are cross motions among them , they are in perpetual revolutions and circumgyrations , nay , there are branlings and trepidations among them , ( which yet the wisest of Philosophers held to be no other then and harmonious found , and sweet regular symphony , ) And as the gran Vnivers runs thus always round , and carrieth all bodies after it ; So Man , who is part or rather the Epitome thereof , specially in reference to his actions , may be said to dance in a circle ; For there is not any thing now acted , but may be paralleled , and exemplified by some Age or other . Therefore among other excellent fruits of Story this is none of the least , to put one off , from wondering at any thing , because he meets with precedents and patterns of all sorts in former times ; He that will observe how some of the great Roman Emperor's were content to live in Capreae ( a petty Island ) how the Princes of Italy fled to the Lake's of Venice for safety , how some of our Kings to the Isle of Man , how Charles the seventh had no other town to keep his Court in but Bourges in Berry , one of the smallest Provinces in all France , which made him called a good while King of Berry ; with a world of such examples , will nothing wonder that your Highness keeps his Court now at Iersey . Nor is this present Story a plain downright confused narration of things , for to compile such a work , is as easy as to make faggots , or to truss up a bundle of straw ; but ( beside other observations and excursions ) that which the Author chiefly aims at , is to make the method of providence in dispensing judgements , and to make a research of the causes of them de longue main , for they seldom come immediately one upon another , but many years , and sometime a whole age intervenes between the judgement and the cause . Furthermore , I have been careful in this Story to vindicat England touching the circumstance of some traverses of State and War , betwixt Her and France , during this Kings Reign , which are misreported by the French Chroniclers : there will be other censures found here beside , but this I have done as he that killed the Serpent upon the child's head without touching his body . It remains , that I implore your Highne's pardon not for the subject of this work , because it's rich and royal , but for the form thereof , if it be not found adaequat to the height of the matter , according to the desires and endeavours of Your Highne's most obedient most loyal and most humble servant ▪ From the prison of the Fleet this Midsummer day 1646.
