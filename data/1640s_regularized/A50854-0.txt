To the much Honoured , and thrice Noble Lord , Robert , Earl of Warwick , Baron of Lees , etc. Right Honourable ; HAving presented the first part of my endeavours of this nature to and honourable Peer , and finding his noble acceptance with respect in the world , above the desert of the Authur , or merit of the work , which with some other encouragements made me bold to tender this second Part , as a freewill offering ( in love ) to your Lordship : being ambitious that it should bear the name of so truly a noble Patron ( honour ed of all ) who have been and still is such a great pillar to uphold this tottering State , whose gallant , faithful , and successful service , will render you famous to all posterity . I confess the humble wing of my Muse lights upon a low-borne Subject , yet modestly possessed with fury , in the midst of temptations , keeps her Virgin beauty ; although she hath to doc with the works of darkness , ( ripened with the corruption of these times ) yet your Lordship may justly judge it too light for your serious meditations . However I doubt not but it may prevail in the intermission of 〈 ◊ 〉 employments , so as to invite a favourable looks from your Honour , which will preserve it from the 〈 ◊ 〉 of envy . I am not so soobe-hardy , as to plead the worth of my Muse , whereby to match her to the mits of the time ; ( nor will she think her self preferred by it , unless they be wisely honest as well as 〈 ◊ 〉 ) but her true intention free from flattery , trimmed in a plain dress , only somewhat of a strange new fashion : yet so , as the fancies may be pleasing to some , the discoveries , useful to others , and the morals profitable to all , who will consider them . All which I leave to your Lordship's protection , and you , to him that will never leave you , till he hath given you the compliment of all 〈 ◊ 〉 . So prays he that desires to subscribe himself , The humblest of your honours Servants , Humphrey Mill.
