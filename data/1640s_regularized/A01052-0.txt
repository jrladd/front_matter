To my Deſervingly-honoured , IOHN WYRLEY Eſquire , and to the virtuous and right worthy Gentlewoman , Mrs MARY WYRLEY his wife , This ſervice . THE inequality of retribution turns to a pity , when there is not ability ſufficient for acknowledgement . Your equal reſpects may yet admit the readiness of Endeavour , though the very hazard in it , betray my Defect . I have enjoyed freely acquaintance , with the sweetness of your diſpoſitions ; and can juſtly account , from the Nobleness of them , and evident diſtinction betwixt Friendſhip and Friends . The latter ( according to the practice of compliment ) are uſually met with ; and often without Search : The other , many have searched for , I have found . For which , though I partake a benefit of the fortune ; yet to you ( moſt equal Pair ) muſt remain the Honour of that Bounty . In preſenting this Iſſue of ſome less ſerious hours to your tuition , I appeal from the ſeveritic of cenſure , to the mercy of your Judgements : and ſhall rate It at a higher valve , than when It was mine own , if you only allow It the favour of Adoption . Thus , as your happiness in the fruition of each others love , proceeds to a constancy : ſo the truth of mine , shall appear less unshaken , as you ſhall pleaſe to continue in your good opinions . IOHN FORD .
