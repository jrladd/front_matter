To the Right Honourable his singular good Lord THOMAS LORD WENTWORTH . My LORD ! SO many are the noble attributes inherent to your Heroic Nature , that it's difficult to distinguish whither they be diverse , or one entire virtue , but impossible to define which ought to be accounted the Superlative in so perfect a Harmony : to ascribe to one more then to another , were to derogate from the justice of either . I cannot therefore proclaim 'twas any particular , but your general Goodness which has emboldened me to intrude this Poem on the Patronage of your Name , as honourable in virtue as in Greatness : nor shall I tender any excuse for the presumption , since I am assured your Lordship cannot conceive and anger from the true devotion of Your humblest honourer , Hen : Glapthorne .
