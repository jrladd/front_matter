To my truly-esteemed and highlyrespected Cousin , THOMAS HUTTON Esquire ; A Member of the Honourable Society of Grais-Inne . TO you , though younger , yet the same in blood , Send I this p • … tterne of parental good : Wh • … se imitation shall you more advance Then Fortune's portion , or Inheritance . For those to Meals of worthless minds are given , Where these Li • … es • … halk you out your way to heaven : Whose lineal-lustre if you do not smother , Makes you Corrival with your Elder Brother ; Whom as I live I love ; and in him you : This shall my Muse in richest raptures show . While Memory over your dead Father rears A Shrine bedewed with Astraeas Tears .
