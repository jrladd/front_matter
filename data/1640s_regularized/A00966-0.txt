TO The worthily-deserving all his ingenuous Attributes VVILLIAM HVDSON Esq. Worthy Sir , I Should derogate from your worth , to doubt of your pardon , andif should wrong too much your goodness to present the endeavours of some frothy brain to the trial of your judgement , when the More ignorant world had already condemned it ; but sir , this is one of the ccheirs of much admired , much lamented Fletcher , whose matchless Fancies are fit only for the perusal of such as you , who have candour and knowledge so united , that there cannot be a reprieve for those Poems you condemn ; accept this weak Testimony of my Service , and as yours by familiar acquaintance with them , favourably entertain these witty conceits particularly presented unto you , by him who shall glory in nothing more than to be styled The Honorer of Your Virtues , ••••
