TO THE Right honourable , IOHN , Earl of RUTLAND , Lord Ross , etc. My Lord , WIth the same boldness that I have adventured to lap up in the folds of a few paper sheets the rich Jewels of Philosophical truths , with the same have I presumed to present them to your Lordship's view ; not that you can receive from them any addition of honour , but that they , from your Name and Protection , may partake a farther degree of irradiation and lustre . Here you may see what odds there are between natural gems , and counterfeit stones ; between solid wholesome meats , and a dish of Frogs or Mushrooms , though made savoury with French sauce , to which that ingenious rather then ( in this Discourse ) judicious Knight does invite us : who , breathing now in a hotter climate , cannot digest the solid meats of Peripatetic verities , which hitherto have been the proper and wholesome food of our Universities ; and therefore entertains us with a French dinner of his own dressing , or with and airy feast of Philosophical quelque choses : a banquet fitter for Grasshoppers and Chameleons , who feed on due and air , then for men , who rise from his Table as little satisfied , as when they sat down . We that have eat plentifully of the found and wholesome viands which are dressed in Aristotle's kitchen , are loath now to be fed , as the Indian gods are , with the steem or smoke of meats ; or , as those â€” Umbrae tenues , simulachra que luce carentum , those pale ghosts in Proserpine's Court , to champ Leeks and Mallows . My Lord , in this Dedication , I only aim at and expression of my gratefulness and observance , which I owe to your goodness ; and of those real sentiments I have of your favours and opinion , which your self , and your truly noble and religious Countess have been pleased to conceive of me . I heartily pray for and accumulation of all happiness on you both , as likewise on the fruit of your bodies , especially the tender plant , and hopeful pledge of your mutual loves , my Lord Ross ; which is the wish of Your Honours humble servant , ALEXANDER ROSS .
