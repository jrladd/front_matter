To the Honourable House of Commons , now assembled in Parliament . IT pleased this Honourable Assembly to require my service in preaching at the late solemn and religious afflicting your souls before the Lord , to which not only my duty but experience of your former acceptance of my endeavours , made me yield a ready obedience . But although I knew your goodness would bear with that weakness which would be discovered in speaking to so grave and judicious and auditory ; yet could I not expect to receive so large a testimony , not only of your acceptation , but thanks , as I and my Colleague have done , much less that you should so expressly send to have them published ; because now what blame shall be cast upon my insufficiency in handling and prosecuting such a subject , must in some sort reflect upon your selves . For my self I answer all objections against my sending them abroad , with this , that they are yours , and it is fit for me to yield unto your disposing of them . For the main lesson handled , the Lord grant that our seeking him while he may be found , may prevent us from being a further proof of it to other Nations , and succeeding generations . And to this end , the same Lord guide and bless unto us , and reward into your own bosoms , and your posterities , all the many , long , and unwearied labours which you have undergone , and still continue in for the glory of his name , the reformation of his Church , the honour of his Majesty , the peace and prosperity of the whole Realm . This is so generally desired and sought for at Gods hands , that I hope the God who hears prayers , will not leave the happiness imperfect , which he seems to have prepared by your means , nor deprive us of the good which you are working . To his wisdom , protection , mercy , and grace , he leaves you , who is your daily Remembrancer at the Throne of Grace . STEPHEN MARSHAL .
