TO THE MOST HONOURABLE AND MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PHILIP Earl of Pembrook and Montgomery , Baron of Shurland , Lord of Cardiffe , Par , Ros of Kendal , Marmyon , and Saint Quintin , Knight of the Order of the Garter , etc. MY LORD , THis piece is the Abridgement of two Sermons which I lately made upon this ſubject in our French Congregation aſſembled in your houſe . I was requeſted by one of the moſt eminent and moſt ancient Doctors of the Church of England , & by ſome of my ordinary hearers , to publiſh it : Not but that this Argument might have been handled by others more powerfully then by my ſelf , but for other reaſons . I have aſſayed to join brevity with the Truth , knowing that you love both the one and the other : For to whom ought I rather to preſent it then to you , MY LORD , to whom all our Aſſembly , and my ſelf in particular , are ſo greatly and continually obliged ? When we pray for PHILIP Earl of Pembrook , our hearts ſay , LORD , he loves our Nation , and hath built us a Synagogue . In effect , the Ark of God wanted a veil for a covering , and you have lodged it in a houſe built of Cedars . Accept , MY LORD , that in theſe lines I publiſh your charity towards us ; and the LORD prolong your days , and pour upon you and your Illuſtrious Family his most precious influences .
