To the Honoured FRANCIS ROƲSE AND Thomas Boon Eſquires , Members of the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS in PARLIAMENT . Honoured Sirs , IT being the great design of God the Father to ſet up his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt , as his King upon the holy hill of Sion , and ( though the Heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things , ſaying , Come let us break their bonds in ſunder , and caſt away their cords from us ) to give him the Heathen for his inheritance , and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion . I ſay , this being Gods deſign , he hath for the effecting of it , given all power and authority in heaven and in earth into his hand , and accordingly Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken to execute all Gods Decrees , which are mentioned in the Prophesy of the Book of the Revelation , where we find that God had decreed , that for and appointed term of time , his Church , his Temple , his Saints ſhould be in and afflicted , perſecuted , depreſſed , low condition , and that the Beaſt , and the Babylonian enemies of his Church ſhould have power to grow great , and to flouriſh , and to make war againſt the Saints , and to blaſpheme God , and his name , and his Saints , for and appointed time alſo , and that after that time was expired , that then Jeſus Chriſt ſhould improve that power that was for that end given to him , in giving a glorious Deliverance to his Church , and ruining totally the Beaſt , great Babylon , and all his enemies , That ſo the Kingdoms of this world may become his Kingdoms , and that in ſuch a manner , as they were not before , even ſo as all that are in authority , that will not caſt their Crowns at his feet , ſhall be broken in pieces , for he the Lord alone muſt be exalted in that day ; there muſt be one Lord , and his name one in all the earth . Now as it most clearly appears to me from the divine Oracles of the Scripture , having compared the works of God , and his Word together , I have in the enſuing Diſcourſe held it forth ( for the encouragement of all that wait for the appearing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the overthrowing of his enemies , and the deliverance of his people from their perſecutions ) that the time is already come , wherein the appointed time of the prevailing power of the Beaſt over the Saints , is come to a perjod ; and accordingly Jeſus Chriſt hath begun to bring down the power of the Beaſt , and to lift up his Saints out of that low , afflicted , perſecuted condition in which they have been , and that in order to the perfecting of theſe things England is already fallen from the mystical Babylon , Rome . Now , Honoured Sir , You having been glorious Stars , ſhining with a great deal of ſplendour in Your Country both in the publikeneſſe of Your ſpirits , and the holiness of Your converſations , wherein You have been eminent Examples , and special encouragements unto others , and knowing that it is the deſire of Your ſouls to ſee the Lord Jeſus alone advanced , whoever be thrown down . I have preſumed to preſent this little Treatiſe unto You , not doubting of Your ingenuous and favourable acceptance of it . But though I publiſh it under Your name and favour , yet do I not thereby deſire You to patronise any thing in it ( if there ſhould be any thing ) that is not truth , and for the truth that is in it , I need deſire no Patron ; For great is the truth , and it will prevail . Yet notwithſtanding the sons of truth , as far as the truth appears to them in truth will own it , and contend for it , and doubtless ſo will You. I am Sirs , A Petitioner to heaven for Zions , this Kingdoms and your proſperity , M. C.
