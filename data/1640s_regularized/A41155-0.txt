TO THE RIGHT Honourable Algernon Earl of Northumberland , Lord Percy , Lucy , Poynings , Fitzpaine , Brian and Latimer , Lord High Admiral of England , Knight of the moſt Noble order of the Garter , and one of his Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council . Right Honourable , THe unworthy oppreſſed Author hath not long ſince groaned under the ſevere cenſure of the late high Commiſſion for the enſuing ſpeculations , which now he adventures to preſent unto your Honour , hoping for a candid acceptance , and interpretation of his poor endeavours for the good of Zion . Had not the riſing Sun of and auſpicious Parliament diſpelled thoſe clouds of oppreſſion and tyranny , that menaced a drowning both to me and them , they had been choked in their embryo , and never enjoyed the happiness they have now attained in your honourable aſpect . Pardon ( moſt noble Lord ) the inforced preſumption of the diſtreſſed Author , which implores and hope's for your Honourable Patronage , and humbly praying for the daily increaſe of your Honours health and eternal happiness , remains Your Honours most humble moſt devoted ſervant , William Fenwick .
