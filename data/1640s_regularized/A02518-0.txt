TO MY DREAD SOVERAIGN , THE KINGS MOST Excellent MAIESTIE . May it please your Matie , AS one , whose heart ( among many thousands ) bleeds with the sad thoughts of the woeful Divisions of our deer Fellow-Subjects ; and unfeignedly pities the misguidance of those poor well-meaning souls among them , whose credulity hath heedlessly betrayed them into a zealous error ; I have let fallen these few Propositions ; which I have presumed to set down , not as in the way of a Challenger ; for , most ( if not all ) of them are such , as be not capable of Contradiction , but rather of a faithful Remembrancer to my dear Brothers , of those Points which they cannot but know , and yield : as well supposing , that nothing but mere want of consideration can be guilty of this perilous distraction , in them , who profess to love their King , and the Truth . Now the good God of heaven open the eyes and hearts of us all , that we may both see , and be sensible of the invaluable blessing of our peace , and the happy freedom of his Gospel , which we do comfortably enjoy under Your MAIESTIES sweet and religious Government , to the wonder , and envy of all other Nations ; and compose the hearts of all your Native Subject's to meet Your MAIESTIES most gracious indulgence , with all humble thankfulness . And the same God forbid that any of us should be weary of our happiness : and be drawn to do any act that may ( before all the world ) pour shame upon our holy profession ; whose chief glory it hath always hitherto been to render us still loyal and obedient , and in this very regard , to triumph over the false religion of our opposites . Such shall be ever the prayers of Your Maties most humble , and faithful Subject , and ancientest Chaplain , JOS : EXON .
