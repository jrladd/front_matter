TO THE SACRED MAJESTY OF KING CHARLES , My most dear and dread Sovereign . SIR , BE pleased to cast a gracious eye upon these three Tracts , The 1. against Disloyalty . and at Your leisure ( if Your Royal Employments lend You any ) to peruse them . 2 . Public Distempers . In Your Three Kingdoms â€¢ You have three sorts of people : 3. Private Calumnies . The first , confident & faithful ; The second , diffident and fearful ; The third , indifferent and doubtful . The first are with You in their Persons , Purses , ( or desires ) and good wishes . The second are with You neither in their Purses , nor good wishes , nor ( with their desires ) in their Persons . The third are with You in their good wishes , but neither in their Persons , nor Purses , nor Desires . In the last , entitled , The Whipper Whipped , these three sorts are represented in three Persons , and presented to the view of Your Sacred Majesty . You shall find them as busy with their Pens as the Armies are with their Pistols : How they behave themselves , let the People judge : I appeal to Cesar . Your Majesties Honour , Safety , and Prosperity , The Churches Truth , Unity , and uniformity , Your Kingdoms Peace , Plenty , and Felicity , is the continued object of his Devotion , who is SIR , Your Majesties Most Loyal Subject , Fra : Quarles .
