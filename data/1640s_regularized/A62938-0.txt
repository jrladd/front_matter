〈1 page duplicate〉 TO The Right Honourable My very good LORD , WILLIAM EARLE of SALISBƲRIE , One of the LORDS of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council , and Knight of the moſt Noble order of the GARTER . NEither ( Right Honourable ) are theſe born out of time ; for ( as Solomonſaies , ) The memory of the just is bleſſed , but the name of the wicked ſhall rot : and here is this Scripture verified in your eyes . Here are good men celebrated , their vertnes poured out to participation ; or , if this indeed has been no firſt , let it have acceptance yet as the latter rain : for ſo to pious remonſtrances , there appertains inculcation ; and the Penpateuch of Moſes , has , after and Exodus , a Deuteronomium , a Lex repetita . Theſe , I ſay , iſſue not unſeaſonably ; for thus have I found a way to correct and redeem ſome ſcattered imperfect Copies , and clear my debt towards him , with whom I was long converſant , at the ſame hearth , the ſame board , and in the ſame bed . Thus a means of acknowledging my dependency , with your Lordship's manifold extraordinary favours : and thus by reprehending ſome others , have I ( for the time to come ) laid a forcible tie upon my own behaviour . After which account given for the publiſhing , and Dedication , I reſt , Your Lordship's moſt humble Servant , George Took .
