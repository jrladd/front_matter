TO THE WORTHILY Honoured , Henry Osborne Esquire . SIR , TIll J be able to give you a better proof of my service , let • ot this oblation be despised . It is a Tragedy which received encouragement and grace on the English Stage ; and though it come late to the Impression , it was the second birth in this kind , which I de • icated to the Scene , as you have Art to distinguish ; you have mercy and a smile , if you find a Poem infirm through want of age , and experience the mother of strength . It is many years since I see these papers , which make haste to kiss your hand ; if you do not accuse the boldness and pride of them ; I will own the child , and believe Tradition so far , that you will receive no dishonour by the acceptance ; I never affected the ways of flattery : some say I have lost my preferment , by not practising that Court sin ; but if you dare believe , I much honour you , nor is it upon guess , but the taste and knowledge of your ability and merit ; and while the Court wherein you live , is fruitful with Testimonies of your mind , my Character is sealed up , when I have said that your virtue hath taken up a fair lodging . Read when you have leisure , and l • tO the Author be fortunate to be known Your Servant , IAMES SHIRLEY .
