TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , As well by the merit of virtue , as desert of birth , MILDMAY , Earl of Westmerland , Baron Despenser , and Bergherst . MY LORD , be pleased to shed one beam on these tender sprigs of Laurel , which will raise them up to that growth , that their shadow will be able to skreen me from the heat of sensure , I have ( through a throng of other business ) pressed so far as to present them to your view ; my zeal to be known to your Lordship ( who is known to be the public Assertor of Letters ) obliged me to offer them up to your name , and if you think the sacrifice not worthy of the Altar , let it be burned , and the flame of it will be so happy as to give me light to see my error â€¢ hat durst presume to consecrate things of so low and estimate , without either sap or verdure , to the shelter of so high a Patron ; so shall I ( by my humility ) entitle my self to your pity , that could not ( by my Poesy ) endear my self to your praise ; for I know ( my Lord ) that your mercy and justice are so equally wound up together , that you can at once both judge and forgive , him who shall aspire to no further happiness then to be acknowledged The humblest of your Servants , Thomas Philipott .
