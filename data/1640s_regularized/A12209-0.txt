TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Sir John Howland , Knight . SIR , THese two Sermons were brought unto me for the Sermons of that learned and religious Divine , whose name they bear : and , so far as I am able to judge , the style and spiritualty of the matter argue no less . Being earnestly requested to peruse them , I thought fit to commend them to the world under your name , because I know that you so well affected the Author . Now my request unto you is , that you would be pleased to accept the Dedication of them as a testimony of his sincere affection , who labours , and prays for your good in the best things , Your Worships to be commanded in all Christian service ; R.
