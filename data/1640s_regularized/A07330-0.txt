TO THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED Sr. Kenelme Digby . Sr. THat it pleaſed you to caſt and eye of favour upon theſe poor Plays has given me the boldness , not only to publiſh them ( which I thought not to have done ) but to ſhelter them , though moſt unworthy , under that name , to which for authority and approbation the richeſt pieces that this nation can boaſt , might be proud to fly . You are to learning what learning is to others a graceful ornament ; and known not only able to receive , but fit to make that which we call literature ; it being nothing elſe but rules and obſervations drawn at the firſt from ſuch able nature's as yours is ; and by your daily converſation is better expreſſed , then we by writing can define it . Your compoſition was made to justify thoſe old Philoſophers who reſembled a man to the whole world . For as in the world all varieties do meet to make a perfect harmony • ſo in the largneſſe of your soul the several abilities of moſt different Nations are conjoined to and honourable advantage of one entire temper , where the predominancies are magnanimi • ty , prudence , and gentleness . But I dare not offer to crowd into a narrow Epiſtle your nobl • Character , which will require a longer Treatiſe and a better pen . For the defects in theſe two Plays , I that have already been ſo much obliged to your goodness in other matters , cannot here despair of your forgiveness , which i • the only thing that puts confidence into Your moſt obliged and devoted ſervant Tho. May .
