TO THE KINGS MOST SACRED MAIESTIE . Moſt dread Sovereign , YOur Majeſty was pleaſed to caſt a gracious eye upon a late Humble Remonſtrance , made to the High Court of Parliament , bemoaning the laweleſse frequence of ſcandalous Libels , and modeſtly aſſerting the true right of Liturgy and Episcopacy . I little thought that ſo meek and gall-less a Diſcourſe could have irritated any the leaſt oppoſition ; But now , I find to my grief , that even to move for Peace , is quarrel enough ; and feel many fiſts about my ears , ere I could imagine to have offended . Occaſion is taken from thoſe quiet lines , to combine forces againſt the Cauſe I maintained . The quarrel is inſolently managed by many unknown hands ; Yet , the riot of theſe impotent Aſſailants ſhould not eaſily have drawn me forth , had I not perceived that their confident oſtentation and proud carriage in this affray , hath wone them ſome ( how undeſerved ſoever ) opinion of skill , with their credulous Abettors ; and thereby , ſome diſadvantage to my juſt cauſe . As one therefore that hates to betray the truth by and unfaithful ſilence , I do cheerfully enter theſe liſts ; rejoicing to hope that Your Majeſties Eye may be the Judge and VVitneſſe of my success . Neither ſhall it be diſpleaſing to Your Majesty , that Your moſt honourable Peers , and moſt faithful Commons , now aſſembled , ſhall ſee the injustice , and ungroundedness of that bold Appeal , which was made to them , by my daring Anſwerers ; whoſe Abilities I tax not , but their Fidelity I must ; as thoſe who have ſought foully to abuſe their implored Judges with falſe shows of misalleged Antiquity , and merely colourable pretences of proofs : Which if I do not make good to them and the world in this enſuing Diſcourſe , let the blemiſh of reputation led way to the ſharpeſt cenſure upon the perſon of Your Majeſties zealouſly-loyall Subject , The moſt humble Remonſtrant .
