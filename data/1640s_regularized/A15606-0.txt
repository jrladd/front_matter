The Stationer to the Reader . IF new or old wit please the reader best , I've hope each man of wit will be our guest , The new was framed to humour some men's taste ; Which if they like not , they may carve the last : Each dish hath sauce belongs to't , and you will By your dislike , censure the Authors skill ; Yet if you cannot speak well of it , spare To utter your dislike , that the like snare May entrap others ; so the book may be Sold , though not liked , by a neat fallacy : That's all I ask yet'twill your goodness raise , If as I gain your coin , he may your praise .
