To my Ingenuous Friend , R. W. WHen we are dead , and now , no more Our harmless mirth , our wit , and ſcore Diſtracts the Town ; when all is ſpent That the baſe niggard world hath lent Thy purſe , or mine ; when the loathed noiſe Of Drawers , Prentices , and boys Hath left us , and the clamorous bar Items no pints i'th' Moon , or Star ; When no calm whisperers wait the doors , To fright us with forgotten ſcores ; And ſuch aged , long bills carry , As might ſtart and Antiquary ; When the ſad tumults of the Maze , Arreſts , suits , and the dreadful face Of Sergeants are not seen , and we No Lawyers Ruffs , or Gowns muſt fee : When all theſe Mulcts are paid , and I From thee , deer wit , muſt part , and die ; We'll beg the world would be ſo kind , To give's one grave , as wee'de one mind ; There ( as the wiſer few ſuſpect , That ſpirits after death affect ) Our souls ſhall meet , and thence will they ( Freed from the tyranny of clay ) With equal wings , and ancient love Into the Elyſian fields remove , Where in thoſe bleſſed walks they'le find , More of thy Genius , and my mind : Firſt , in the ſhade of his own bays , Great BEN they'le ſee , whoſe ſacred Lays , The learned Ghoſts admire , and throng , To catch the ſubject of his Song . Then Randolph in thoſe holy Meads , His Looers , and Amyntas reads , While his Nightingale cloſe by , Sings his , and her own Elegy ; From thence dismissed by subtle roads , Through airy paths , and ſad abodes ; They'le come into the drowsy fields Of Lethe , which ſuch virtue yields , That ( if what Poets ſing be true ) The streams all ſorrow can ſubdue . Here on a ſilent , ſhady green ; The souls of Lovers oft are seen , Who in their life's unhappy ſpace , Were murdered by ſome perjured face . All theſe th'inchanted streams frequent , To drown their Cares , and diſcontent , That th'inconſtant , cruel ſex Might not in death their ſpirits vex : And here our souls big with delight Of their new ſtate will ceaſe their flight : And now the laſt thoughts will appear , They'le have of us , or any here ; But on thoſe flowery banks will ſtay , And drink all ſenſe , and cares away . So they that did of theſe discuss , Shall find their fables true in us .
