To the Right Worshipful , Colonel Richard sbuttleworth of Galthrop , in the County of Lancaster , a Member of the Honourable House of Commons , in this present Parliament . 1646. Sir IT is too apparently visible , how it hath pleased our only wise good God , to suffer this poisonously infected Cup of heart-dividing distractions , to be generally and strongly handed to most of this Kingdom , yea and the dregs thereof to seize upon the vitals of many ; which hath produced , even very dangerous and unexpressible epidemical Anxieties and Sinco • … s . Upon serious and frequent meditation thereof , raised through my own sad experiences , even in the midst of our greatest continuing misery's , I her have endeavoured to fit and prepare this discourse , as a Counterfeit • … fectionary of spiritual Relief and Cordial Comfort for all such as may fa • … le and faint under the heavy pressures of any of this world's Afflictions ; and now make bold to present them unto you , not as if • … any necessity in you called upon any such advertisements : But that I very well know with what christian resolution and patience you have out passed the loss of 〈 ◊ 〉 hopeful and valorous son , slave in the public cause of Religion & Kingdoms , beside the danger of your own , hazard and wounds of diverse other your sons , banishment from your own house & family , plundering of your goods , and the continued want ( even until this time ) of a part of your estate . These , I say , may sufficiently testify your proficiency in this more then Aesculapian Art : Yet howsoever in tender of my due observance to your self , hoping their shortness may no way impedite your more serious employments , now of public concernment and present agitation : I dedicate this Cordial , and offer the perusal thereof unto you : Desiring from my heart , as they are by me intended , they may strengthen the weak and feeble , be oil of joy for mourning , and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness , and so safely to usher us along in uprightness and holiness here , that we all may receive eternal bliss and happinese hereafter ; through Christ Jesus our Lord , which is the constant and fervent prayer of Yours ever bounden , S.B.
