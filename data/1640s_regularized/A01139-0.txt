TO THE NOBLE AND much honoured Company of HIERVSALEM'S ARTILLERY , all increaſe of skill , Success and Valour . AS the Saints were not after the fleſh , ſo the weapons of their warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God , to bring down all the ſtrong holds and mighty imaginations of devils and men , plotted cunningly againſt the Iſraelites of God ; yea , all the forces of the fleſh and the world muſt faint , and fly upon the uſe of theſe Arms . Of this complete glorious Armature , Prayer is a special part ; yea , it is the very evergetical manifestation of the powof all the reſt . Jt putteth on all the other parts , it keepeth the whole armature cloſe to a man , it ſanctifieth all the reſt to their ſeveral uſes it guardeth all the reſt of the golden furniture from thieves and robbers , it daunteth the Devil and the Devils limbs , it carrieth the armed Soldier through out all forces and furies , as a victorious Conqueror . And hence is that ſaying of the Ancients , Supplications and Tears are the Arms of the Saints . As the power and excellency of this spiritual piece is unexpreſſible , by tongues of men or Angels ; ſo am I the leaſt of all to be called , of ſo high & heavenly a faculty ; but ſince it hath pleaſed him that hath mercy on me to teach me the uſe of it , ( though in much weakness , ) and to guide me as a weak pencil in his draught of the truth of it , to whom ſhould J then commend it both for the Touch & Tuition , but to the Military Forces of the new Hieruſalem , who are experimentally acquainted with this piece of proof ? To you then my deer & thrice noble Fellow-Souldiers , the Trained Band of heaven , the Artillery men of the moſt High , I dedicate my self and this little Treatiſe ; accounting it my only happiness if I be but a doorkeeper of the Company ; bear with the feebleness of my hands in the unſheathing of this Sword : man you it with a holy and undaunted courage , and it will maintain you . Times call you all to the breach , ſtand cloſe one to another ; hold faſt what ye have , and let no man take your Crown : Lay about you with this fiery ſhaking blade upon all within you & without you , that oppoſe Chriſt & his Kingdom : Walk worthy of ſo high a gift ; make not this good commodity to be ill ſpoken of ; part not with your Arms and you ſhall overcome . If theſe my poor pains may add any thing to your skill , the greateſt recompense I crave is to have a ſhare in your cunning Your fellow-Souldier and Servant in love GEORGE FOXLE .
