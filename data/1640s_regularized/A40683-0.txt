TO THE HONOURABLE , and nobly accomplished Knight , Sir IOHN DANVERS , all the blessings of this , and a better life . SIR , we read how Zachariah being struck dumb , called for Table-books thereon to write his mind , making his hands to supply the defect of his mouth : It hath been the pleasure of the present Authority ( to whose commands I humbly submit ) to make me mute , forbidding me till further order the exercise of my public Preaching , wherefore I am feign to employ my fingers in writing , to make the best signs I can , thereby to express , as my desire to the general good , so my particular gratitude to your Honour . May this Treatise but find the same favour from your Eye , as once it did from your Ear , and be aswell accepted when read , as formerly when herd . And let this humble Dedication be interpreted a weak acknowledgement of those strong obligations your bounty hath laid upon me . Well may you taste the fruits of that tree , whose root your liberality hath preserved from whithering â–ª Sir , these hard times have taught me the Art of frugality , to improve every thing to the best advantage ; by the same rules of thrift , this my Dedication as returning thanks for your former favours , so begs the continuance of the same . And to end , as I began , with the example of Zachariah , as his dumbness was but temporary ; so I hope by Gods goodness , and the savour of my friends , among whom your Honour stands in the highest rank , the miracle may be wrought , that the dumb may speak again , and as well by words publicly profess , as now by his hand , he subscribes himself , Your Servant in all Christian office . THOMAS FULLER .
