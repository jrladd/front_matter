To the Honourable Philip Skippon , Major General of the Army , raiſed for the King and Parliament , under the Command of Sir Thomas Fairfax General . NOBLE SIR , Supposing you may take the Book called the Vindication by Maſter Prynne into your hand , I deſire that this Diſcourſe may be in your other hand , as occaſion ſerves . If the Lord hath revealed any thing in this Diſcourſe , to enlighten the darkness of this preſent Controversy , it is only from him who is the Father of Lights , who carries on his to a more excellent way , till we may with open face , behold the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt , and be changed from glory to glory . Sir , The thing I only contend for , is , that which the Goſpel and Spirit calls for ; Whatſoever things are pure , whatſoever things are honeſt , whatſoever things are of good report . Sir , The engagement of private reſpects which are upon me towards you ; and being likewiſe a partaker of ſome labours of yours in the Lord , which are abroad , as that of Promiſes , etc. The beſt treaſure we have in this life , hath drawn this from me . The Lord who hath wounded you , bind you up , and led you on to the glorious Truths ; for , if I miſtake not , our Controversy is but this in theſe times ; ſome would walk more cloſe with Chriſt , ſome can be content like Peter to walk at more diſtance , and follow him afar off , and to ſtand warming themſelves with the multitude in the Common-Hall : And let the Word judge betwixt us , which is of beſt report . Sir , Yours in the things of Ieſus Chriſt , John Saltmarſh . 〈1 page duplicate〉 〈1 page duplicate〉
