TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Richard Braithwaite ESQVIRE . Sir , I Have ( though boldly being a stranger ) elected you , to countenance a piece , that ( undeservedly I hope ) hath been denied the credit which it might have gained from the Stage ; though I can accuse my self of no error in it , more than a nice curiosity ( which not withstanding I must boast to be without president ) in the method where I have denied my self much liberty , that may be allowed a Poet from old example , and new established custom . Your self have given many sufficient testimonies of your own abilities and judgement , by your own many published and unquestionable labours . In giving way and pardon to this bold act of mine , you will engage to thankfulness , & honour him that is ambitious to be known by you , and stiled Your honourer and humble Servant , Thomas Nabbes .
