To the Fowls of Night . TO you , whose lives are eaten up with lust , Your spirits and your names consumed with rust , Whose souls are bought and sold , whose bodies will Unsheath your wicked practices , to fill The world with wonder ; you , by whom Hell best Is here , and in her place below expressed : To you , who poison earth with your foul deeds , And from your breast your torment ever feeds , I do present my lines , if taken well , They may hedge up your passages to Hell , And break your league : If not , your damned cause ( Which is condemned by my Satyric Laws ) Will gender vipers , who will gnaw the sweet , And bite your bowels , till their teeth do meet : Whence life it self , against your health shall strive ; You vassals , are not dead , nor yet alive . You trim your vice , and will your humours have , Although your corpse are dressing for the grave , Maintain your sinful freedom , prove it's more Disgrace in living chaste , than be a whore . Death hath his charge , your plots being all revealed , Judged by a Statute not to be repealed ) Expect the execution ; then your pet Will no way save you , till you pay the debt ; oh which you were engaged for , with delight , 〈 ◊ 〉 can time bale you ; though you're found by night , You cannot scape away . Ah! well ! I must With such vile Rebels leave my Search in trust .
