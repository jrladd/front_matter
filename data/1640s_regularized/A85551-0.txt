TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL , Sir BENJAMIN RUDYARD , Knight , one of the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS . SIR ; AS formerly I have acquainted you with two ſmall Treatiſes , which were dedicated to his MAJESTIE and the Right Honourable the High Court of Parliament , ſo now I have preſumed on Chriſtian affection , to dedicate this victory of Truth to your religious view and meditation . The odds in the conflict was much ten to one , and every one of them being roots of a thouſand branches , even ſo many in number , and ſo gross in nature , that if I ſhould ſpeak all I know of them , it might seem incredulous to your exerciſed and experienced judgement , and prejudicious unto many that want the like knowledge and diſcernment , ſo that for this time I thought thus briefly to disarm the Leaders , that ſo the following multitude of the Army may have premonition before the time come that all the enemies of Chriſt ſhall be slain before him , and the ſecrets of all manner of hearts diſcovered . And for my own particular , Sir , finding the boldness and impudence of error , as well as the multiplicity , whereby the whole City is in every part and place infected , and from thence , as from a fountain , the Countries alſo , I could reſt no longer ſilent , for as much as God of his own goodness and infinite mercy , hath been pleaſed to communicate and impart the knowledge of the myſtery of his Word unto me in ſome meaſure , notwithſtanding my own unworthiness and weakness : this truth received in my heart , hath been as a fire which I could no ways hinder from burning into a flame , through the light whereof , by the means of your grave and prudent countenance , he that reads it may have information of the evil and error without prefigured , and within this Treatiſe manifeſtly revealed ; as alſo the good and happiness of truth , the old path and ſtraight way of the Lord , in ſome meaſure opened and declared ; to which all that are not of the household of faith are ſtrangers , and moſt of them perverters . And Sir , I pray of one thing take notice in the figure , that he that is moſt obſcure in his perſon , is moſt dangerouſly subtle and myſterious in his doctrine ; and at this very time , in which you fit in Parliament , with the whole Counsel of the Kingdom , he does more hurt in one hour then in ten heretofore ; his badge is F. Wherefore Right Wor : be pleaſed to take notice of the Churches enemies , and let the deſpiſed and perſecuted wife of Chriſt , and her little children , have your love , help , and aſsiſtance . Theſe are all that are entreated for to be granted by you , moſt virtuous and noble Senator , to him that is your faithful and humble ſervant , JOHN GRANT .
