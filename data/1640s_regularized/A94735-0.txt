TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Richard Aldworth Eſquire , Mayor , the Aldermen , Sheriffs , and the reſt of the Inhabitants of the City of BRISTOLL . HOw tenacious the heart of man is of ſuperſtition , as former ages , ſo the preſent generation do abundantly declare . No age can yield a more horrid instance of a people taught ſo much as this Nation hath been concerning the true Worſhip of God , admoniſhed ſo often ▪ that God is not pleaſed by humane rites , and yet ſtill place their Religion in them , oppugn the repreſentative Body of the Commonwealth , for ſeeking to remove them , fight for them tanquam pro aris & focis , spoil their own Country , with ſuch cruel despite drive away their faithful teachers , and unspotted neighbours from their dwellings , wives and children , and think it a good work to deſtroy them for not yielding to practice things never appointed by God and notoriouſly tending to ſuperſtition , and for their faithful dealing with their souls in labouring to draw them from their vain confidence in the fleſh to worſhip God in the ſpirit , and to rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus . Hope ſomewhat to abate this fire of rage , moved me at firſt to caſt this bucket of water to quench it . But as it happens often , that when water quenches not a fire , it flames out the more by casting water on it : ſo it be fell me : the barbarous rage and impetuous violence of people ſo increaſed , that I could have no ſafety in my proper ſtation , but was inforced to remove my self , Wife and Children , and ſince have ſuffered the spoiling of my goods , of my dwelling houſe , with many other injuries . After much toſsing up and down , J have in Your City caſt anchor , till either a greater storm enforce me to commit my self to the Main again , or a favourable gale bring me into a Harbour . And that J may testify my love to this City , and gratitude for my preſent entertainment , and withal aiming at your edification , J have preſumed in publiſhing this Sermon , to prefix your Names , to whom J humbly preſent it for your uſe and acceptance , and do profess my self Yours , in the ſervice of Chriſt Ieſus , JOHN TOMBES .
