To the High and Mighty Prince CHARLES , Prince of Wales , and Duke of Cornewall : Eldest Son of our Sovereign Lord , CHARLES , King of Great Britaine , France , and IRELAND . SIR , THE Dedication of Chronicles hath in all times been thought worthy of the greatest Princes : Gulielmus Gemiticensis writ a Chronicle of the Dukes of Normandy , and Dedicated it to William the Conqueror . Thomas Walsingham writ a Chronicle of the Kings of England , and Dedicated it to King Henry the sixth : And of late time , Sir Francis Bacon , Viscount Saint Albans , and Lord Chancellor of England , writ a History of the Reign of King Henry the seventh , and Dedicated it to Your Royal Grand-Father of blessed memory , King Iames : For indeed , as nothing makes Princes more Illustrious then Learning ; So no Learning makes them more Judicious then History ; Other Learning may fill their minds with knowledge ; This only with Judgement : And seeing it is Judgement that must fit as President over all their Actions , it is fit that History should fit as President over all their Studies . History gives and Antedate to Time ; and brings Experience without grey hairs : Other Knowledges make You but see Quod antepedes est ; History is the true perspective Glass , that will make You see things afar off : And though it make not men to become Prophets , yet it makes their conjectures to be little less then Oracles • But most Illustrious Prince , there accrues to your Highness , by this Chronicle , a greater benefit then all this ; For if it were and Excitation of great force to virtue , to have it said , Et Pater Aeneas & Avunculus excitet Hector ; of how great Force must it needs be , when You shall read the Noble Acts of so many your worthy Progenitors ; Some Eternized for their valorous Achievements in War : Some for their prudent government in Peace : Some Renowned for Mercy , some for Justice : And although the Example of your Royal Father be not among them , yet it may be sufficient that while you have the Acts of others upon Record , you have his under View , by which he seems to say unto you , Disce Puer virtutem exme , verumque laborem ; Fortunam ex aliis . And if in any of your Progenitors , there appear , as it were Maculae in Orbe Lunae , will it not invite you to a higher Orb , that Your Actions may shine with the clearer Beams ? and then how happy will the eyes be , that shall see you sitting in your Throne ? For my self , I should account it happiness enough , that I have lived to see the days of your Illustrious Father ; if it were not a great unhappiness to see them overcast with clouds ; & yet when these clouds shall be dispelled , will it not make him shine with the greater Splendour ? And this as old as I am , I doubt not to live my self to see , and having once seen it , shall then willingly say my Nunc Dimittis , and l • have the joy of your glorious times for another Age : In the mean time prostrating my self humbly at your feet ; and wishing to your Highness , as WORSER • iphobus did to Aeneas ; — I Decus , I Nostrum , Melioribus utere Fatis . Your most humble and most devoted Servant , RICHARD BAKER .
