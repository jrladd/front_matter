TO MY WORTHY FRIENDS , The well Affected Inhabitants of the Town of Great Yarmouth . Much eſteemed in the Lord , WHat you lately received from the Pulpit , take here from the Press , that what was then Tranſient in the Ear , may be now Permanent to the Eye . Weak bodies which are ſubject to Heart-tremblings and faintings , uſe to have their Cordials , or Strong-waters by them . To like purpoſe serves this Extract , intended for and Aqua Coeleſtis , for the fortifying of your Spirits ( in theſe times of Common Danger ) againſt what ever fears or dangers you may happily encounter with . If you ſhall have need , make uſe of it ; otherwiſe let it remain by you ; I dare aſſure you , it will be no ill store . However , I ſhall leave it with you , and reſt Your ſervant in our Lord Iohn Brinſley .
