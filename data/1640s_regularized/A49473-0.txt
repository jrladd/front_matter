TO THE Right Honourable , ROBERT , Earl of Essex and Ewe , Viscount Hereford , Lord Ferrers of Chartley , Bourchier , and Lovain , Lord Chamberlain of his Mties household , and one of his Mties . most Honourable Privy-Counsell . MY LORD : LOW shrubs are sheltered by lofty Cedars ; I hope the same from your Honour . The Subject which I present is warlike , though my Profession be peaceable : it's compendious , and not traced by many , scarce by any before : I have made the discovery ; and refer the whole , being discovered , to your Honours judgement . It's not the mere fancy of a Scholars brain , but many years Experience abroad in foreign Leaguers , with great danger , which produced it . Accept it ( Great Lord ) though presented at no less a distance than the foot is from the Head : and when your weighty Military Engagements will afford your Honour some small recess , vouchsafe it a perusal . I have been so bold to present my self , and this small Tract of war unto your Honours protection , in regard your Honours Regiment ran the same hazards of war in Germany with three more of our English Nation , under the Command of our General the Lord Morgan ; wherein I was embarked , and with whom I suffered resolutely and willingly the utmost of dangers that a professed Enemy with all his power & policy could proportion for our troops . Secondly , I know your Honours ability to determine of a Subject of this Nature , and to protect both the Parent and the Child from public Injury . That the Great God of Hosts may safeguard your Honour , and that your goings Out , and comings In , may be for ever prosperous and successful , prays the meanest of your Honours Servant , DONALD LUPTON .
