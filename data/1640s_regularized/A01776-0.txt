TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , IEROME , Earl of PORTLAND . My Lord , DEdications , from some Writers are mere Customs ; from others Compliments ; but from me neither : my Muse being yet too young to be authorized by Custom , to intrude upon a Patron , ( this being the earliest flight of her ambition : ) and my Reason too old to suffer me to be guilty of Compliment to one so furnished with all Reality and Worth as is your Lordship . My motive , Sir , to this audacious error is only the pretence of my respective duty ; and for that cause , will ( I hope ) merit and indulgent pardon . What you shall here find set down , were the Maiden-Studies of a Muse , which aspires to no other Fame than your allowance : nor can my self achieve a greater quiet to my soul , nor aim a higher glory , than to see my self by your free acceptance of this trivial Sacrifice ranked among The humblest honourers of your Name and Family : HENRY GLAPTHORNE .
