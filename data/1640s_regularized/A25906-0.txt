TO THE TRULY HONOUrable , Sir William Playters Knight , and Baronet , etc. SIR , THe Interpretation of Dreams is of the ſame Original and Extent , as is the inſpiration or Divine Virtue by which they are infuſed . That God appeared in Dreams and in the Viſions of the night , the ſacred Text does plentifully testify ▪ And that GOD unto ſome ſelected men , by a peculiar ſpirit , did give the perfect knowledge of the Interpretation of Dreams ; the ſame Divine Truth does give remarkable demonſtrations . I need not to declare unto you the admirable gifts of Joſeph , almoſt in the firſt Age of the world ; and of the Prophet Daniel in the ſecond . Their Interpretations in thoſe days of the Dreams of the Egyptian and Aſſyrian Monnrchy , do ſufficiently declare the prescience of their ſpirits , and how near of kin they were to God , Our Author being a Philoſopher , and working only by ſecond cauſes , by the light of Nature ; had not that happy intereſt to be ſo immediately , ſo divinely inſpired . SIR ; I make bold to preſent him to you in and Engliſh dress : And although by the Ignorance of Antiquity he had the misfortune to be a Heathen , you ſhall find him through the Excellence of his merit , to be clothed in the moſt refined Languages of Chriſtendome . I have the rather been induced to devote this Book unto you , becauſe your Candor to the Arts , and excellent Experience in the great and choice affairs of Peace and War , is of a wide Latitude , and not to be confined within the Engliſh bounds . Your Experience beyond the Seas , does ſufficiently declare your worth , both when you traveled firſt by your ſelf , and when being Major Domo , you afterwards took with you ( the lively image of your ſelf ) your moſt noble and hopeful Son ; whoſe underſtanding in the knowledges both Polemical and Political you increaſed by foreign obſervations , and admirably enlightened it by your own example . According to your nobleness , in this tempeſt of War receive this Preſent of the Arts , and be pleaſed to protect revived Artimedorus : And alſo , ( though the Subject be of Dreams ) to excuſe his zeal , who will ever be awake to express himself to be ( SIR ) Your moſt humble and devoted Servant ; BERNARD ALSOP .
