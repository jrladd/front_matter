TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL HIS MOST WORTHY and ever moſt highly honoured good friends , Sir RICHARD SPRIGNALL , Sir IOHN WOLLASTONE , Alderman PENNINGTON , and Alderman WARNER , Together with each of their moſt truly virtuous and pious Conſorts , my ſingular good friends ; All of them eminent Patrons and Patterns of Piety , Virtue , Religion and Learning : J. V. unfeignedly prayeth the moſt happy , fair and full fruition of the glorious effects of the plenarie-Reformation intended by this pious Parliament , here ; And of the Saints celestial beatificallviſion , in Heaven , hereafter . HAving by Gods good hand of providence and direction ( Right Worshipful and my moſt highly honoured good friends ) undertaken a ſubject of Gratitude to our holy God in this ſucceeding historical narration of all his wonder-ſtriking Parliamentarie-mercies to us of this Engliſh-Nation , in general ; I could not but reflect my ſerious thoughts on your Worſhips as moſt worthy objects alſo of my thankful heart , for many ſingular favours and courteſies towards me , in particular . And ſomuch the rather becauſe of that which Chryſoſtome , in his 51 Homily on Geneſis , hath as ſweetly as ſuccinctly touched . Nihil tam gratum Deo & homini quam anima grata & gratias agens . Nothing in the world is ſo acceptable to God or man as a gratefull-heart and a thankefultongue . The due and deep conſideration whereof ( I ſay ) hath made me moſt deſirous ( as moſt bounden ) to tender this • umbl • and plain-ſti • ' d history of Englands God in the Mount of Mercies , • r , Englands Remembrancer of gratitude to God for all the Parliamentary precious bleſſings moſt fully and freely conferred ; or rather poured-down upon her within theſe 2 years laſt passed , as a • eſtimonie of my moſt thankfull-heart to your good Worſhips for many both public and private favours to me and mine . Which history though I ingenuouſly acknowledge it might well have befitted a far more fluent and high-ſoaring rhetori • all-Penman than my poor and plain unworthie-ſelf ; yet ſince it hath pleaſed the Lord that my poor zeal for Gods glory hath thus prevented them , I moſt humbly hope and heartily deſire candide and courteous acceptance of it and of my ſincere deſire and endeavour , mainly , to manifeſt my infinitely obliged gratefull-heart , firſt , to our everliving and ever-loving wonder-working Lord God ; next , to our moſt Pious Patriots , his precious Agents and inſtruments in theſe great and glorious works ; and then to your worthy ſelves my much honoured friends : Which my endeavour herein , though ſhort ( I ſay ) of your judicious exp • ctation , and of the hiſtories due deſert , yet hoping it may remain as a pledge of my plighted humble ſervices and bounden gratitude , and as the beſt Barthol'mew-faring , which my poor ability was able to preſent to your good Worſhips , with the humble tender alſo of m • heartieſt poor prayers to the throne of grace for all ſanctified sublunary bleſſings and celestial ſoul-cheering graces on you and a • l yours , I ever reſt , Your good Worſhips in the Lord , to be always commanded , JOHN VICARS .
