ANOTHER TO HER HIGHNESSE . I Do not dedicate theſe to delight Or profit you , both are the Authors right : Nor is it that your Highness may protect My part , it merits not ſo much reſpect ; Nor that you may examine and compare , It less deſerves ſuch ſerious Princely care : Nor is it gratitude , becauſe you have been Pleased to approve ſome others you have ſeen : Since retribution ſo far below Proportion , would be worſe then ſtill to owe : Nor vanity , that thus I may have leave To tell the world the honour I receive , In that my name hath reached your ſacred ear : I hate that empty vice ; yet need not fear The cenſure , were it juſt ſince iT would make proud The ſtaideſt thoughts to be by you allowed . If any ask me , What is then my end ? It's to approve my self a real friend To chaſte Lauretta , whom ſince I have taken From the dark Cloister , where ſhe did remain Unmarked , becauſe unknown , my aim is now To make her happy , by attending you : Where ſhe may ſee her trueſt worth outgone , And learn more virtue then ſhe yet hath known The humbleſt of your Highness ſervants ANNA HUME .
