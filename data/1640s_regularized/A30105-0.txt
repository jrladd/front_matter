TO HIS HEROIQVE FRIEND , EDWARD GOLDSMITH of GRAIES-INNE , Esq. SIR , WHen I first ( according to my open and free manner of communication to my Intellectual Friends ) showed you a Copy of my Idea , which acquainted you with my scope and general projection upon Gesture ; you were pleased ( as in a Platonic ecstasy of apprehension ) to admire the vastness of the Design , to applaud the rise thereof , and the promising aspect it had to the advancement of Learning ; insomuch as filled with the benevolent influence and illustration of a Prophetic rapture , you turned Chiromancer , divining by the lines of life and prosperity , which appeared fair unto you in the first draught ; that the Hand would be embraced and kissed by the more intelligent part of the world , and in time travel and learn to speak ( as it does naturally ) so literally all Languages . This strong reflection of your conceits on my early undertakings , you have by the vivacity of a mastering fancy , oftentimes endeavoured to propagate in the opinions of your most generous Acquaintances , which as they were the friendly efforts of a subtle perspicacity of your Judgement ( which I have herd a Great Critique to acknowledge to be the genuine felicity of your intellect , whereby you are able to dissect the least atom of a Philosophical projection : ) I have ( though the raising of expectation proves many times and injurious courtesy ) took as a good omen to advance upon . What was then a cloud that had neither the shape , nor bigness of a men Hand , is now grown fit to be held up , and by its own suffrage to choose and confirm you its Patron : For , I affecting no Dedication that rises above the level of Friendship , having intentionally consecrated all the issues of my recess and leisure to certain select Friends ; This both by prescription and signiority of acquaintance as by a Prerogative , and by a reciprocation of love for your affection to it , falls to your Tuition . I confess some other of my digested thoughts struggled for precedency , claiming by the analogy of Nature's usual course , and the Head would have had the privilege of primogeniture : But it fell out in the contention somewhat like as in the case of Tamars twins , where Zarah put forth his Hand , and the midwife said , This is come out first . However this Chirosophie or first Fruits of my Hand be accepted abroad , having put forth my Right Hand in sign of amity to you , and for performance of promise : there remains nothing ( most noble Chirophilus ) but that you take it between Yours in token of warranty and protection , as the tender offspring of one who is Your affectionate Friend , JOHN BULVVER .
