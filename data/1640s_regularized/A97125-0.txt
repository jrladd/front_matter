TO THE HONOURABLE Houſe of COMMONS Aſſembled in Parliament . AT your Command this Sermon was Preached , by your Order it hath been Printed , and now its humbly offered to your hands , and under your Honourable Patronage made Public to the view of the world . I know well that the ſame Sermon , as to the life of it , is ſcarcely the ſame in the hearing , and in the reading : But that acceptation which it found when it came from the Pulpit , gives me hope that it will not be caſt aſide , as diſreliſhing or unprofitable ; now its come from the Press . The Lord command a bleſsing along with it unto you , and make you and your unwearied labours , a bleſsing to the Church and Kingdom . So prays Your moſt unworthy ſervant in the work of the Ministry . IOHN WARD .
