TO THE FAVOURABLE ACCEPTANCE Of the Right Honourable PHILIP Earl of Pembrooke and Mountgomery , etc. Sir , HAving collected these papers out of their dust , I was bold to hope , there might be something in them of a better fate ( if mine obscure pen darken not that too . ) Please your Lordship to let your name , make them another witness of your nobleness , it may redeem and improve them , to a clearer opinion and acknowlegedment of these times , in which I am to meet every Critic , at his own weapon , who will challenge the Book at the very Title : The Malicious and Malevolent , with their blotted Comments ; the Captious & Incredulous , with their jealous praecisian • sines , whose inclinations shows them of envious perplexed nature's , to look at other men's actions and memory by the wrong end of the perspective , and ( me thinks ) I fancy them to our shadows , which at noon creep behind like Dwarves , atevening , stalk by like Giants ; they will haunt the noblest merits and endeavors to their Sunset , then they monster it ▪ but to the Common-rout , they are another kind of Genius , or ignis fatuus ; leads them into dark , strange , wanderings , there they stick : for to persuade the opinionated vulgar out of their ignorant selves , is of as high a belief to me , as to transpeciate a Beast into a man ; I ( therefore ) shall crave favour , to protest these papers beyond their Censure , and humour : But to those they are wished ( I hope ) their weak accesses may be the more pardonable since they are the kindlings and scintillations of a modest Ambition , to truth and gratitude , which gives me the encouragement to assure your Lordship , that if mine Authors be sincere and faithful , my penis free and innocent , having learned , that a story ( as it ought ) must be a just , perspicuous Narration of things memorable , spoken , and dONE . The Historiographer , veritable ; free from all Prosopolepsyes , or partial respects , and surely his pen should taste with a great deal of Conscience , for there is nothing leaves so and infected a sting , or scandal , as History , it rankles to all posterity , wounds our good names , to all memory & places , by and Authentic kind of prejudice : I am with his opinion , in his excellent Religio Medici , who holds it and offence to Charity , and as bloody a thought one way , as Nero's in another ; My Lord , under these humble addresses , this sues to your honoured hand , Presented by the unfeigned wishes of your Honours avowed and humble Servant , GEO : BUCK .
