TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE MASTER , WARDENS , And Aſſiſtants , of the Trinity Houſe in Deptford Strand . ALbeit ( Right Worshipful ) there be more eſſential nature's contained in each part both of this Macrocoſme , and Microcosm , exiſting in their abſolute being , than the underſtanding of man can fully apprehend ; yet I doubt not , but thoſe which may with labour and diligence be known , & thoſe alſo which of ingenious ſpirits and notable wits have been invented , and by them artificially & methodically taught , ( tending not only to manifeſt profit in the Commonwealth , but alſo to the great increaſe and ſetting forth of Gods divine power , wisdom , goodness , providence , and increaſe of Virtue ought of all men to be embraced , ( and eſpecially of thoſe which have any government , public charge , or authority in the Common wealth . ) In regard that the nearer men approach to ſuch excellent Virtues , the nearer ( without doubt ) do they come unto goodness , to felicyty , and to God himself . Hence says the Prophet ( unto men ſeated in eminent places ) Dixi vos dii eſtis , ſo that thoſe which either through arrogance , or ignorance deride , and contemn thoſe Arts ( which with great dexterity , care , and induſtry have been found out , and left unto us by the love of our Predeceſſors ) do both offer contempt unto the goodness of God , and do much endamage and annoy all humane ſociety . So on the contrary part , they that do by all means further thoſe ſo profitable Diſciplines do both render true honour unto GOD , and do greatly advance the good of the Commonwealth wherein they live . Now in regard there is no ſtudy ( Divinity excepted ) wherein the wit of man may be better employed then in the motion of the ſtars , and in the knowledge of their ſituation , place , and being , together with their wonderful effects : In regard whereof I was incited to employ ſome of my time in the ſtudy thereof , and at laſt conſidering that of the Orator , that Non ſolum nobis nati ſumus , etc. We are not born for our ſelves only , but our friends challenge a part in us , and our Countries come in for a ſhare , eſpecially thoſe honours and graces of our Country , thoſe that traffic in the deep , and have their business in the great waters , thoſe that are unto this Iſland as a wooden wall , the Sea-chariots , and the horſes of England : theſe , I ſay , may claim juſtly to the fruits of our labours , whatſoever they be which have not altogether been abhorrent from the Mathematical ſtudies : conſidering this , I could do no less than bring in this my mite into their treaſury , and Si quid Ars mea efficere poſsit , ( if my skill can ſtand them in any ſtead ) to further that ſo much deſerving Science of Navigation . Accept therefore , I beſeech you , this young son of my ſtudies , this little handful of paper , wherein is contained not Anacreons wanton Odes , or Ovids laſcivious Elegies , the incendiaries of luſt , but a pure ſpark of chaste Veſtalfire , a ſmall part of the Mathematics dedicated from a ſerviceable affection to your VVorſhips , that under the ſhield of your protections it may live ſecure , from the deſperate ſtab of of critical perſons , and envious ſpirits , who not only like ſnarling Satires deride and contemn thoſe ſo liberal Sciences , but ſwallow up with deſpite ( if it were poſſible ) the professors thereof . For reſcue from ſuch malignant ſpirits my Book flies to the ſhadow of your favour , which if you ſhall afford unto it , my labours ſhall be all ſacrificed unto you , and I reſt . Your Worſhips bound ſervant , IOHN ASPLEY .
