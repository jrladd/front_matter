To the Right Honourable My very good LORD , HENRY LORD Marquess of Dorcheſter , Earl of KINGSTON , etc. AND One of the Lords of His MAIESTIES Moſt Honourable Privy Counsel . My LORD ; THe ſecret love of Hero and Leander firſt brought to light in the pure Greek of divine Muſaeus , was afterwards new moulded in Latin by the fluent Ovid ; in imitation of whoſe Epiſtles , the moſt eminent Poets of all Climates have ( in their native languages ) written upon this ſubject ſo many Paraphraſes and Essays , that like the numerous streams of Nile , they almoſt overflow the remembrance of their Fountain . I confess the report of Poems borrowed from Muſaeus made ſo great a noise , that to me the Author had been loſt in the crowd of Imitators , if I had not herd his ſoft lines sweetened by your Lordſhip's accent ; but then I could not be ſatisfied till I made trial how the Greek would go in Engliſh : my intent being to tranſlate and dedicate it privately to your Lordſhip . The Tranſlation was forthwith diſpatched , the Dedication is now preſented , but the intended Privacy lay not in my power ; for my acquaintance ( who would know what I was doing ) had engaged me for ſo many Copies , that I held it my ſafeſt courſe , rather to venture upon the Printers pardonable errors , then to run the hazard of gross miſtakes in ignorant Tranſcribers . Yet , as I could not make it altogether private , ſo I meant it ſhould not be altogether public , and therefore at firſt I ſuffered no more to be printed , then the juſt number promiſed . But now , finding ſo many friends as challenge not a few copies but a whole Impreſsion . I am forced to anſwer them , as Piſiſtratus did his ſons , that I have done my best to convert them to my Opinion , but ſince I cannot prevail , I am reſolved to be of theirs ; and for their ſakes , what I writ for my private excerciſe , shall be expoſed to common cenſure , yet among the crowd of Readers if ſome pretending Critic ſhall aſsault me , I ſhall ſmile to ſee him retire with double ſpeed , beholding the name of the illuſtrious and learned perſon that privileges Your Lordſhip's moſt humble ſervant , ROBERT STAPYLTON .
