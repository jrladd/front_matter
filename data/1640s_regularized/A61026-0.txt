TO My Honourable Friends Sir John Wray Knight and Baronet , Sir William Strickland Knight and Baronet ; Both Members of the Honourable Houſe of Commons . HONOURABLE ; I Know you both well to have loved the acquaintance of Truth long , and in thoſe times when truth was and error , and light darkness in the account of most ; therefore I hope the ſame Lord will not ceaſe to reveal to you more of himſelf , till you come to know as you ſhall be known . The truths ( if I miſtake them not ) I here preſent you , are of Freegrace , ſuch things as if cleared to the World , would enlighten us more in the myſtery of iniquity then any other . There is one thing appears to us in the diſcovery of this , which is love , God loving us freely , and ſending out his Spirit of love into our hearts ; this ſhould be that only principle of power in believers now under the Goſpel : love began all the work of ſalvation in God , and love ſhould carry on this work of ſalvation in men· This is a way of ſervice which none know , but thoſe whom the Son hath made free indeed . The Lord fill you with this love , that you may obey as gloriouſly as you are commanded in the Goſpel , and that the experiences of Freegrace may dwell richly in you ; that you may ſpiritually judge of the ſiner and more subtle parts of Antichriſt . All is not in that gross Idolatry , which is ſeen and felt ; there is more of myſtery then ſo in it . I could not but thus publicly acknowledge you , who are ſuch public Aſſertors of that Liberty we of this Kingdom enjoy at this day , and becauſe you have acknowledged me in many favours to my ſelf formerly ; for which I am Your Servant in the Lord , JOH . SALTMARSH .
