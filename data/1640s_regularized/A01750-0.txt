TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDWARD LORD VISCOVNT CONAWAY , AND • ILVLTA , BARON OF RADGLEY MARSHALL OF IRELAND , AND ONE OF HIS Majeſties Moſt Honourable Privy Council of 〈 ◊ 〉 . May it pleaſe your Honour , TO admit this Act of Recordation , that it's full Fourteene years ſince the happy Aſpect of your gracious Favour did reflect upon me , for my good both by Sea , and Land : which left in me ſuch and Impreſsion of the Character of your Noble and Religious Diſpoſition , that to this very Day edgeth a freſh deſire to take this advantageous ( though in another reſpect , a ſad ) Opportunity to testify my dutiful reſpect to your Honour . It may be , this Art of Building Comfort is not ſo artificially , and laboriouſly compoſed , as you have herd , and was pleaſed to countenance ſome Vniverſitie-Pieces of mine : there might be more oil beſtowed on them , to varniſh the Face of their ſtyle ; but this Treatiſe is allowed more Wine to comfort the Heart of the Reader . This induced me to preſent to your gracious Acceptation , this Earneſt of that Debt of Thankfulness , wherein both your Favours , and Deſerts ( tàm Arte , quàm Marte ) have bound me to you : a ſmall Earneſt is ſufficient to bind the greateſt Contract ' twi • tO a bountiful hand , and a thankful Heart . Let this be ſuch of my Gratitude , and not only a Pledge of Mine , but a Remembrance of Hers , ( I mean my dead Wife ) whoſe Living Thankfulness to God for your Favours to me , you had , though not made known unto you . And if your more then ordinary Employments will permit you to read over , either Her deſerved Commendation : or Her Epitaph which is much too narrow for her worth , ( both are in the adjoining Pages ) then I hope your Lordſhip will have no cauſe to repent the Dedication of this Treatiſe . In the mean time my Experimental knowledge , that in you the Nobility of Deſcent and Mind concur : the Eminency of Parts in your self , and Affability of Diſpoſition to others do mutually reflect each on the other : which Harmony may well challenge this my voluntary Oblation , as a neceſſary Obligation , that for ever ties me to fix my Devotions on Heaven , and heartily to pray for your temporal , spiritual , and eternal Happiness . Your Honours to diſpoſe of William Gilbert .
