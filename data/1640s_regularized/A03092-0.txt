TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Sir EDWARD POWEL , Knight and Baronet , one of the Master's of his Mties Court of Requeſts . Noble Sir , THere is a double Tie upon my duty towards you , that binds me to the largeſt acknowledgement that can be expressed by my beſt abilities : Your general eminence both in Honour , and , the worthieſt means to it , Deſert ( which duly challenge the general obſervance of all men ) and your particular noble favours to me , that require from me a never ſufficient gratitude . But as Preſents derive their valve as well from the esteem of the Receiver , as from their own inherent qualities ; ſo will you make this rich by your acceptance , that is without all worth as it is my poor Donative , though it contain in it self many ſecret and mystical virtues , being and Enchiridion of many rare subject's , both Moral and Divine , fit for the moſt ſerious obſervation and meditation : The induſtry of many excellently-learned Authors , whoſe several Papers were moſt accidentally committed to me , to be their fortunate , though unworthy , preſerver and Publiſher . The only end for which I beg your Noble diſpoſition to entertain it , is that it may be underſtood a teſtimony of his due thankfulness , whoſe only ambition is to be known and styled , The humbleſt of your ſervants . R. H.
