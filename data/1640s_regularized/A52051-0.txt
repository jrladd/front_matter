TO The Reverend and Learned the Prolocutor , Assessors , the Commissioners of the Church of Scotland , and the rest of the Assembly of Divines , now sitting in Westminster . SOme few of us who are of your number , freely bestowing our Labours in the Abbey-Church , every Morning ; we agreed among our selves to instruct our Auditors in all the necessary Truths of that Doctrine , which is according to godliness ; One taking for his Subject , the Articles of Faith ; Another the Ten Commandments ; Another the Lords Prayer , etc. My lot of late hath been to handle the Doctrine of the Sacraments , and coming in order to this Point , I endeavoured to clear it as fully as I could in one Sermon , and was thereby compelled to borrow a little more time then is usually allotted to that Exercise . Importunity of many Friends , who conceived it might give some light to that which is now made a great controversy , and might through the blessing of God , be a means to reclaim some deceived Souls , or prevent the deceiving of others , hath brought it thus into Public view . And although I know my self the unworthiest , and unablest of many , yet because I am assured that it is Gods Truth which I have Preached , and which he will bless , I was the more easily overcome by that importunity ; if it may contribute any thing to the helping forward of the great Work now under your hands , and may ease you of any part of that Labour which so exceedingly presseth you , therein I shall rejoice ; And in the opportunity I have by Dedicating this to your Names , to testify that I am Your unworthy Brother and Servant in the Lords Work , STEPHEN MARSHALL .
