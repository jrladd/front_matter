TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL THE MASTER , WARDENS , ALDERMEN , ASSISTANTS , And the reſt of the Society of the HABERDASHERS . THis Sermon ( Worthy Sirs ) is Dedicated to you , becauſe Preached by your appointment , and now publiſhed , through the importunity of many of you , who herd it ; It was neither ability in the Author , nor choyſeneſſe in the Work , that cauſed this Sermon to take ſo well among ſo many of you , but the suitableness of the Subject , to the preſent times , and it may be , the familiar plainness of the Sermon did work much with ſome ; ( Ferrum poteſt quod Aurum non poteſt ) Iron may do that which Gold cannot do ; A blunt Sermon may , by Gods bleſſing , work more upon the hearts of the hearers , than that which is more acute , and in it self more excellent , as for other reaſons , ſo from the nature of the thing , becauſe moſt suitable to the moſt of hearers ; that which the underſtanding does not reach , cannot take the affections . The Author studied not to pleaſe , but to profit ; he prepared and delivered this plain Sermon , with a heart bleeding for the preſent troubles of our Iſrael , and breathing after the public peace , and common good , as the ſpirit of the whole Sermon shows ; and he does confess that no importunity ſhould have prevailed with him , to have given it this ( unthought of ) ſecond birth , had he not been withal pressed unto it , by his own persuasion , that that which was accepted being herd , may , being publiſhed , do good to many who herd it not . Some little is added in a place or two , which was prepared , but , through want of time , was omitted in the delivery ; What ever it is ( Worthy Sirs ) it is yours , if you pleaſe to own it , and ſo is the Author of it yours , who deſires to be reckoned among thoſe who reſpect and honour you , and pray for you , and acknowledgeth himself your debtor , for many favours , and reſts Your Worſhips ever in the Lord , SAMVEL FAVVCET .
