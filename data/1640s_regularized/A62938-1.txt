TO The Right Honourable , and my very good LORD , FERDIN ANDO LORD FAIREFAX Baron of CAMERONE . Right Honourable ; THe Press being now to rectefie ſome pieces of mine , formerly miſ-recorded , I have likewiſe added this old Elegy , and long racked up in darkness ; dedicating it thus with all propriety , ſince as relating to that imcomparable HELD , GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS , what name among all our modern Worthies , has ſo nearly followed , into the ſpur of his triumphant Chariot , as that my good Lord , which both your self , and yours , have ſo brightened with many glorious ſucceſſes . If either the style be quarreled , for high , and difficult ; or perhaps the method , as over-fancied , and unusual ; yet when to handle ſuch a conquering , ſuch a covering Cherub , what if invention strain ſomewhat beyond it self ; nay though expreſſions alſo be ſtrange , and even sometime prepoſterous , yet was that labour improbus of the Latins , a very pathetical piece of rhetoric ; and thus alſo was Godfrey of Bulleines mettle upon mettle , ſuch and elegant ſoeliciſme , as ſaid him able to refine the moſt ſtain and , to the moſt honourable bearing . Let it not therefore intercept your favourable allowance , if I have taken and untrodden path , where the common road was diſproportionable ; and yet again , you may pleaſe to receive the tender graciouſly , as being free from all unworthy reſpects ; and with much candor , intending only a discharge of that duty , which all good men owe your real nobleness ; amongſt whom , and ſuch as ſhall ever aim at your commands , not one more affectionately deſires to be listed , then Your Lordship's moſt humble Servant , GEORGE TOOK .
