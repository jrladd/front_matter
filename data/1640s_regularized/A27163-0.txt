To His Highness IAMES Duke of YORK . SIR , IN the lowliest posture of Humility these Historical Examples , extracted out of the choicest Authors both Ancient and Modern by two learned Doctors , are presented to Your Highness ; Neither would they presume to put themselves under so high a Patronage , did I not humbly conceive , that being Historical Pieces , they might be fit for Your Highness perusal , History being the properest and most advantageous Study that Princes can apply themselves unto , because it contains examples of all sorts ; In History Brave men stand as Marble Statues erected in the Temple of Immortality , and Bad men as Malefactors upon Gibbets , exposed to the public view of the world to all Posterity . Although Your Highness hath a Royal Father for and incomparable living Pattern of all the Cardinal Virtues with their Attendants , ( which breaking through these late Clouds of Civil Confusions ) shined with and advantage of lustre to the wonderment of the world ) as also against any thing that may have the least vicinity with Vice , to imitate , yet , humbly under favour , variety of Examples , as of Witnesses in Law , cannot do amiss , the one for confirmation of Truth , the other for direction of Life ; In which opinion I rest , Your Highness most Humble , and most obedient Servant , M. HERON .
