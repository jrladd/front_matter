TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTY . THE TRUE CHVRCH AND CHILDREN , THE TRUE FAITH AND RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST do humbly present their Petition of Right . THAT whereas a Book entitled , A Relation of a Conference between WILLIAM LAUDE , and Mr. FISHER the Iesuite , hath been by the said WILLIAM , now of Canterbury , lately republished , and that , under your Majesties Patronage , and in the publishing whereof ( as he says ) he hath obeyed your Majesty : And whereas A Reply to the said Relation is now , under the Patronage of JESUS CHRIST , and in obedience to his Word , and by assistance of his Grace , here published and presented to your Majesty and before all the World ; in which Reply are detected and clearly evinced , by manifold and infallible Testimonies sundry particular passages and Doctrines of the Relator , which directly overthrow all true Christian Faith and Religion : And whereas in this Reply is clearly proved , that Prelatical Government of the Church , or the Hierarchy ( as they call it ) is mere Antichristianisme , and the very Mystery of Iniquity , branded by the Apostle , and expressly forbidden by Christ himself to his Apostles , whose Successors the Prelates falsely pretend to be ; and that all Prelates , even as they are Prelates , are both by their Profession and practice , so many Anti • hrists , adversaries to CHRIST , who ( as the Great Antichrist ) fit as Gods in the Temple of GOD , Lording over the Faith , Soul , and Conscience of GODS People , thrusting CHRIST out of his Throne : And whereas notwithstanding the manifest truth hereof confirmed by most clear Testimony , and undeniable Proofs of Scripture , the Relator , or Prelate , hath in his said Relation uttered sundry blasphemous Speeches , belying the Wisdom , Counsel , and Providence of GOD , and of CHRIST , as making Him the Author and Ordainer of such a Hierarchical Government of his Church , which is to Father upon GOD and CHRIST , a most notorious Lie and Falsehood ; where he adds withal a blasphemous New Article of Belief of the Church of England , that this is a truth : And whereas the Holy Scriptures is and hath been in all Ages , and by all Found and Orthodox Divines , both Ancient and Modern , both Foreign and Domestic , universally received , held , and constantly believed and maintained against all Adversaries of the Truth , to be the Only Rule of Faith and Judge of Controversies in Divinity , and alone Self-sufficient to give Testimony to it self , that it is the undoubted Word of GOD ; as in this Reply also is fully proved : And whereas the Relator notwithstanding hath loaded the Scripture with many intolerable repr • ohes , and blasphemous words of disgrace , censuring it as and insufficient witness to it self , and and incompetent Judge of Controversies in Faith , as being both a blind , dumb , and dead Judge , and that it hath no light in it self , but is as a Candle in a box without light , till , Tradition of the present Church do light it ; and the like , the very ground of all Infidelity and Apostasy . And whereas notwithstanding all such his blasphemies against the Scripture , wherewith he hath stuffed some 30 leaves in Follio , beside many other the like , scattered all along his Book , he , the same Relator out of his gross hypocrisy adds this proud Blasphemy to all the rest , That he hath given the Scripture all honour , and ascribed unto it Sufficiency more then enough : And whereas also ( as appears in this Reply ) the Relator belies and blasphemes the Holy Ghost himself , making him the Author of most notorious lies and vanity : And whereas the Relator does define a mere false and counterfeit Catholic Church , contrary to that Holy Catholic Church , believed in the Creed , whereby he overthrows both that Article of Faith , and with all the Communion of Saints , teaching , that his Catholic Church , though it cease to be holy , yet is a true Church of CHRIST still : And whereas of and in this his new Catholic Church which the Relator believeth , he makes the Church of England and of Room to be one and the same Church , and both to hold one and the same Faith of that his Catholic Prelatical Church ( which Faith is declared in the Reply not to be the true saving Faith ) and that they both do set up and profess one and the same Religion , not different , in which Faith and Religion of the Church of England and of Rome ( he says ) as he hath lived , so he resolves to die ; as much to say , as he will live and die and English-Romish-Catholicke : And whereas the Replier proves ( and which not Papist denyeth ) that the main substance of the Romish Religion is the Mass : And whereas the Relator confesses , that ( though a simple Papist may , as he says ) yet not Romanist , as a Romanist , living and dying in the Roman Faith can be saved , and yet this Faith of Rome is the same with that of England , wherein he will end his days ; So as the Church of England may hereby see in what a case she is , and how highly she is preferred by her Primate , as to be brought to be of the same Church , the same Faith , the same Religion with Room ; enough to startle all your Majesties Subject's , that till now thought themselves to bo Protestants , and no Papists ; and to cause all zealous Christians to abandon all communion with such a Church , as is the same Church , of the same Faith and Religion with Room : And whereas this Relator professes and teaches a blind Charity ( suitable to his Faith ) which he boldly affirmeth to be not a mistaken Charity , in granting , that a silly ignorant Papist , so living and dying , may be Saved by his Ignorance in that Religion , conforming himself to his Religious life : and on the contrary condemning such Protestants of stiffness and churlishness , that are not of the same Charity with him , though the Replier proves , that there is no true Charity without true Faith and Verity : And whereas the same Relator is showed in this Reply to give much more liberty to your Majesties Protestant People to go • to the Romish Mass ( as being with him one and the same undiffering Religion with that of England ) then the Jesuite does to his blind Romanist , to come to the English Church : And whereas the same Relator hath many passages , wherein he makes a General Council of Prelates , Judge in all Controversies of Faith , ascribing unto them and Infallibility ; and in case they shall err , and that even in gross things , and points of Faith , yet that all men are bound to yield obedience , at least external , till another General Counsel equal to the former reverse those Errors ; whereupon by Consequence of this Prelatical doctrine ( as the Replier does instance ) the Church of England it self is bound to observe the worship of Images , and the forbearance of the Cup in the Sacrament , etc. decreed in General Counsels , and not yet reversed by other General Counsels equal to those : And whereas the Relator calls Transubstantiation , Purgatory , and the forbearance of the Cup but disputable and Improbable Questions ( the nature of which is , to be taken indifferently Pro and Con : And whereas he never once in all his Relation calls the Romish-worship of Images , and of the Sacrament , or any other Idolatry in all the Romish Church , but only by the name of Superstition , abstaining altogether from the name of Idolatry , as if with him the Roman Church were no Idolatress : And whereas he much lamenteth the Separation and rend between the Protestants and Room , with the continuance of it ; although with the Iesuite , he confess , that error in Faith is just cause of separation : And whereas he the same Relator does cunningly , yet palpably enough , in sundry passages of his Book ( as also he hath openly done viva voce at the High-Commission-Board ) exclude all the Reformed Protestant Churches beyond the Seas , as no Churches of Christ , as not admitting the Hierarchy ; Finally also in his Book quipping Luther , and in him all the Reformed Churches , as having made a rend not only from Room with her corruptions , but even from the Catholic Church it self ; which indeed ( in the Relators sense and definition of the Catholic Church ) is most true , to wit , from the universal Hierarchy : And whereas he , the Relator , does every where highly extol his Ceremonies in Gods worship , as without which ( he says ) there is no light left to shine before men that they may see his Devotion , and so glorify GOD , ( therein most foully and odiously perverting and abusing the holy Text of Scripture uttered by CHRIST to a clean other purpose as the Replier hath noted ) all which Ceremonies , being a will-worship after the Tradition and Commandment of men , the Apostle does utterly condemn , as whereby the very merits of Christs death are made of none effect , who in his death destroyed All Ceremonies in Religion obliging the Conscience , and not only the Levitic • ll , but all other whatsoever of humane Ordinance , as the Replier clearly proves ; So as it is not left to any Power on Earth to impose the least Ceremony , ( yea though it be of nature indifferent ) to bind the Conscience in the service of GOD , seeing all such imposition is Antichristian Tyranny : And whereas all Prelatical , Heretical , and Antichristian Faction erected by the Prince of darkness against Iesus Christ , and his Kingdom , as is apparent both by their profession and practice , wherein they have nothing at all , yea not any one thing to show , wherein they resemble either Christ , or any one of his Apostles ( except Iudas ) Christs Kingdom being altogether spiritual , and not of this world , but the Hierarchy a mere carnal and worldly Kingdom , only guilded over with the bore name of spiritual : And whereas the Relator throughout his whole Book bewrayeth his most palpable and profound ignorance , and notorious blindness in the whole mystery of Faith and all true divinity , in so much as when ever he Cites Scripture , he still perverts it to a wrong sense , and is not able to bring any proof either from Scripture , or Common Reason ( except from some of his Jesuitical Authors ) for any of his Paradoxes and strange doctrines , delivering all without Book , tanquam è Cathedra , as but of some Papal unerring Chair , upon the Authority of his bore word , and upon mere trust : And whereas the Relator says , That worth once misled , is of all other the greatest misleader , and who of greater worth in the Church of England , and in the Esteem of Great ones too , then the Great Primate himself , whose very word with many is taken as a divine Oracle ; So as if the Church and State of England will but pin their souls upon this Leaders sleeve , he will not fail to led them in that way , the issue whereof ( seem it never so right in the eyes of credulity ) will certainly prove to be ( as Solomon says ) the ways of death : And whereas by the Relator , sundry occasions are ministered to the Replier of instancing diverse practises charged upon the Prelate , as the principal Agent or Instrument of setting up sundry Innovations in Religion in the Church of England , all which have been done under his Primacy ; as , The republishing under your Majesties Name , the Book for liberty of profane Sports on the Lords day , with pressing Ministers to read the Said Book in their several Congregations , and upon refusal , extremely persecuting them , and thrusting them from their Ministry and means , with their poor wives and children ; The authorizing and licensing of some Doctors Books , which cry down the Morality of the 4th Commandment for the Sanctifying of the Lords Sabbath day ▪ The setting forth of a New Order to restrain Preachers from Preaching in the Afternoons on the Lords days , much pressed by the Prelates and their Officers in all their visitations : The setting forth of a Declaration in your Majesties Name , prefixed to the Articles of Religion , which the Prelates practises plainly interpret to be for the restraining , and prohibiting altogether the Doctrines of Saving Grace to be preached , and wherein the genuine sense of those Articles touching Grace ( which formerly were universally interpreted to have but one sense agreeable to the Scripture ) is confounded with the heterodox heretical doctrines of the Pelagians and Arminians , so as none can tell what to make of those Articles , saving that by this means the Orthodox Ministers must not preach the truth , and the Adverse party and Faction may find footing and countenance for their groundless and graceless heresies , and all this to the manifest dishonour of the Word of Grace , the distraction of good Ministers , and the destruction of many thousand souls ; The pressing and setting up of Altars , attended with sundry adorations , images , crucifixes , to the open Scandal of many , and for non-admittance whereof , with other Innovations , or rather Renovations of old Popish Relics , many good Ministers and people of GOD have deeply suffered ; by all which practises and sundry more , the Replier hath plainly and particularly proved , how the very Foundations of Faith and Christian Religion are not only terribly shaken , but razed , and ruined , so as the very Foundations of the earth do tremble withal , and more especially , how not only by unmoralizing of the 4th Commandment ( whereby the Floodgates of all profaneness are broken up ) and the uncanonizing ( as it were ) or making void of the doctrines of grace , but by the setting up of Altars , with all their Service and Ceremonies , is and absolute denying and renouncing of Iesus Christ our only Altar , as the Replier hath showed at large : And whereas notwithstanding terrible persecutions ( if it be lawful to call a Spade a Spade ) have followed upon these Innovations , which have fallen most heavy upon the faithful Ministers and their Families , yet the said Relator ( whither out of notorious hypocrisy ▪ or egregious malice , or both ) is not afraid to abuse the Sacred Name of GOD , nor ashamed to cast a mist before the open eyes of all the world , saying , * GOD forbid , I should ever offer to persuade a Persecution in any kind , or practise it in the least ; whereas , if Persecution be Persecution , whither he hath persuaded to it , or dissuaded , perhaps your Majesty can tell ; and how little he hath practised it , thousands have sufficiently felt : And whereas the Replier upon occasion by the Relator , hath declared fully the Tragical Story of the Cause , Censuring , and suffering of a late Minister of the Gospel ( depriving him of his Ministry and all worldly comforts ) and all for the mere discharge of his Ministerial duty , in admonishing his people of such dangerous Innovations , as were then creeping , yea and crowding into many Churches ; for the which he hath been so terribly censured , and still suffers both close Imprisonment and Punishment , with Divorcement and Separation from wife , and children , and all friends whatsoever , as a man buried quick in a Marble Tomb of perpetual Calamity , the very Image of hell ; such and Example as no age , no history , sacred or profane is able to parallel , that a man should be so terribly Censured , and that upon this very ground , that he would not do that , whereby he should assent to the condemning of his Cause before the hearing his Answer in Court for Defence of his Cause being wholly precondemned by the two Judges , as impertinent and Scandalous : And whereas notwithstanding the Relator does still insult , trample upon , and embitter his ink with gall , blacking the innocent with foul reproaches , whom all the Court could not charge with the least offence or crime , but that they said , he was too bitter , which he gave good reason for : And whereas the cry of innocent blood both of that Servant of Christ , and of his Companions , is gone up to heaven against the whole Land , pleading and claiming Justice at that High and righteous Throne , so as heaven and earth are troubled with the cry , which will not be appeased , till Justice be done : And whereas GOD hath put into your Majesties hand , both the word of his Truth , as the only Rule whereby to reform all errors and corruptions wherewith his worship is profaned ; and the Sword of Justice to vindicate the Cause of the oppressed Innocents : And whereas so great a work , as the Reformation of Religion is above the Sphere of any ordinary Court of your Kingdom , so as even the Honourable Board of Starre-Chamber disclaimed that Office , where the said Innocent standing before them desired Justice in that behalf ; yea and is too heavy a burden to lie upon the Kings shoulders alone , and much more as the case now stands in such a perplexity of things , and universality of corruptions , which as a leprosy hath overspread the whole body of the Land : And seeing Christian , Prudent , Grave and Pious Princes use not upon the first found or sighed , to slight , or reject as fables or flashes of some brainsick man , such deep charges as the Replier here presents , and presseth hard upon the Relator by such found and demonstrative arguments , and which do so nearly concern the State of the whole Land , which ( by reason of Prelatical outrages , seconded with the publication of the said Relation , the very Portent of Confusion ) lies now a bleeding : And whereas the contempt of just complaints , and neglect of Justice in such Cases of so high a nature , would necessarily argue , that men have sold themselves , as having made a covenant with death ( as the Prophet speaks ) and and agreement with hell , being justly given up of GOD to worser • struction , as in the case of Amasiah King of Iuda , who threatening the Lords Prophet for reproving him,1 Chron. 25. the Prophet replied , Now I know that God hath determined to destroy thee , because thou hast not harkened to my Counsel ; even as it came to pass a little after in the same Chapter , Amasiah would not hear ; for it came of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought after the Gods of Edom : as the Prelate professes for the Church of England one Faith and Religion with Room : And whereas the Hierarchy being and Antichristian Kingdom , shall perish with Antichrist , and all they together , that support and confederate with it against Christs Kingdom , his Gospel , and Truth , as the Relator does in his Book ; So as to suffer such a Rebel against Christ ( as the Replier hath proved him to be ) and much more to Patronise him and his work , were to maintain open war against heaven , and to make your Majesty guilty of all those blasphemies and heresies in it ; which GOD forbid : And whereas to whom much is committed , of him much shall required , and the Office of Kings is of all other highest on earth , and therefore God will require the strictest account of them , and the more , where the light of the Gospel hath also clearly shined forth , leaving no place for pleading ignorance , it being lo the honour of Kings to search out a matter ( as Solomon says ) thoroughly to inquire into the Cause brought before him , and therein to do exact and impartial justice , much less committing the Cause to be judged by the Adversary or Party , but to judge righteous judgement : And whereas GOD hath sent of late sundry fearful signs from heaven , as warning-pieces to England , to awaken the State thereof to a more deep consideration of the condition , wherein it stands obnoxious unto , and naked before that dreadful Judge for her most notorious and hideous crying sins , iniquities , transgressions and impieties in all kinds , and in the highest degree , and to lay down her high pride , and self-confidence , and giantlike daring in lifting her self up against Iesus Christ and his High-Throne , in oppressing and trampling upon his sacred Word , and Ministers , and People ; lest by standing out in open defiance against God , and in the defence and maintenance of her Rebellion with a high hand , God be provoked altogether to confound her ; So as ( if a more mature Reformation of such hideous enormities , whereof the Relator is here , by the Replier , convinced , be not seriously thought of , and speedily and effectually put in execution ) to be secure in looking for Peace , or any Good , ( not having thus made peace with God ) were but to bewray a mind desperate , and passed all hope of remedy : And lastly , whereas the Replier to all these his high Charges upon the Relator hath ( for some special reasons to himself ) not set his Name ( it being neither out of any distrust of the goodness of his Cause , nor yet fear of men by others Example ) when as your Majesty shall pleased to send forth your Royal Edict , commanding that the Repyer ( whoever he be ) come forth and appear to make proof of all his Allegations against the Relator , assuring him of and equal , just , and fair unpartial hearing in such a Court of Justice , as the Replier himself shall nominate , and appeal unto , which is not , cannot be less , then the most High and Honourable Court of Parliament , which the necessity of things , so nearly concerning the whole Land , does with all importunity call for ; he ( the Replier ) will then be ready ( God giving him life and health ) in all humble duty and allegiance to present himself , and personally face to face , before the Honourable Court ( by the assistance of that Grace , which first set him awork , and enabled him to finish it ) make good his whole Reply against the Relator . It would therefore please your most Excellent Majesty ( the weighty Premises seriously consi • ered , and upon your mature Revisall of this Reply , or at least of the brief contents thereof prefixed to the Reply , with the eye of your soundest and sollidest judgement , directed by the wisdom of Gods own Spirit , which hath the hearts of Kings in his all-swaying hand , and for vindicating of Gods glory , and your own honour , so deeply suffering in the forenamed respects , and for staying of Gods hand stretched out , and the preventing of further calamities ) not only to take to heart , and into your Royal hand the speedy reformation of such things , as have been done ( and all in your Majesties Name still ; for that must bear all the burden ) since the Relators Primacy : as namely in the first place , to send forth your Royal Edict for the taking down of all Altars ( which where ever they stand , do stand in open defiance against Christ ) another , for the calling in of your Book for Sports on the Lords days : a third , for the calling in of your Declaration before the Articles of Religion : a fourth , for the calling in of all Order for the restraint of Preaching : a fift , for the restoring in Integrum , that is , not only to their Ministry and Charge , but to their liberty in Christ from the bondage both of Prelates and Ceremonies , all those godly Ministers , who out of Co • scien • e and duty towards God , and not out of any disrespect , or muc • less disloyalty towards your Majesty , for refusing to read the said Book , have been by the Prelates thrust out of all : a Sixt ( if not the First ) for the quite releasing and setting at full liberty your three poor banished Prisoners , that the loud cry of their oppressions break not through the walls and bars , and roofs of their straight enclosure to the piercing of the heavens , and the provoking of their wrath to dart down the thunderbolt of Divine revenge to the blasting of the beauty of your State , while ( as a tall Cedar , or sturdy Oak ) it stoutly lifts it self up on high , as if it would threaten heavens throne : and lastly , all this done ( without which what can prosper ? ) and that you may make your Peace with GOD , as you have done with Scotland , to Proclaim a Public Fast with Prayer and Humiliation , for the deprecating of Gods high displeasure for what is past , and the procuring of his favour and blessing upon you and your Kingdom : and thereupon send forth your Royal writs for the calling of a Parliament for the redressing and removing of the main Causes of all the disorders and enormities in the Church and State : So shall your Kingdom be established , and your Crown flourish in abundance of Peace and Prosperity to your Majesty , and your Royal Posterity , which the Petitioners , the true Church and Children , the true Faith and Religion of Iesus Christ will never be wanting to solicit the throne of Grace for .
