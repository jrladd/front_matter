TO THE RIGHT Honourable , my very good LORD , WILLIAM Earl of SALISBURY , One of the LORDS of his Majeſties moſt honourable privy Council , and Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the GARTER . WHereas the manage of a real war , is now familiarly every men Tract , the premiſes unconſulted , and our proviſional Muſters and Militia still left at large , without any Paraphraſe : my near and usual privity with them both thus impoſing ; I have here propounded for ſome ſuch temper , as might render each to be fair and flouriſhing : Neither can it be preſented with more propriety , then to the maſterwheele , from whoſe courſe and influence , my ſubordinate motion hath ſucceeded . And may your Lordſhip deign it a favourable regard ; I dare be bold ( how defective perhaps in several particulars ) it ſhall yet induce ſo much diſcourſe , and contemplation , as by hammering out infallible rules , may requiſitely mature both . Finally , your gracious acceptation , of ſo mean a piece ; will , beyond the many favours formerly collated , still lay a further obligation , upon Your Lordship's ever bounden Servant , GEORGE TOOK .
