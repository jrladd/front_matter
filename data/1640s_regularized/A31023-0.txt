TO HIS MAIESTIE . SIR , TO wait on YOU , the Persian MIRZA'S come From the fair shades of his El • z • um : If all the wrongs that's Innocence oppressed Obtain one s • gh from YOUR heroic Breast , H • ' l think them 〈 ◊ 〉 , having preferred Him to • OUR Royal Know • edge ; and perhaps done so More then his Birthright bad ; for he hope's now Not only to deal • ght , but profit YOU , • n warning to eschew what spoiled his Right , The Flatterer , and too powerful Favourite . In old Time , sacred was the Po • ts Pen , And useful to eternise worthy men : To Rescue Virtue from the Furies spite , •• worser lift her Palm the h • gher for the weight . And I could wish it the next Ages Song , Had MIRZA not died , He'd not lived so long : His ( written ) Ghost looks brighter in his Ba • Then He had in the Crown of Persia . So shall it be : Gain from His Loss shall flow , And Life from Death , if YOU , Great SIR , say so . BARON .
