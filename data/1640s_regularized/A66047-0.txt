TO HIS HIGHNESSE The Prince Elector Palatine . May it please your Highness , I Should not thus have presented my diversions , where I owe my study and business , but that where all is due , a man may not justly withhold any part . This following Discourse was composed some years since at my spare hours in the University . The subject of it is mixed Mathematics which I did the rather at such times make choice of , as being for the pleasure of it , more proper for recreation , and for the facility more suitable to my abilities and leisure . I should not Sir , have been ambitious of any so Great ( I could not of any Better â–ª ) Patronage , had not my relation both engaged and emboldened me to this Dedication . They that know your Highness how great and encourager you are , and how able a Judge in all kind of ingenuous arts and literature , must needs acknowledge your pressures and low condition , to be none of the least mischiefs ( among those many other ) under which the Commonwealth of learning does now suffer . It would in many respects much conduce to the general advancement of religion and learning , if the reformed Churches in whose cause and defence your family hath so deeply suffered , were but effectually mindful of their engagements to it . And particularly , if these present unhappy differences of this Nation did not occasion too much forgetfulness of their former zeal and professions for the vindicating of your family , and the restoring of your Highness ; the hastening and accomplishment of which , together with the increase of all heavenly blessings upon your Highness , shall be the hearty daily prayer of Your Highness most humble and most devoted servant and Chaplain , JOHN WILKINS .
