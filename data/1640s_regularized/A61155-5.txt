To the Reverend Divines of the Presbyterial way . Brothers , THeſe are the ſig hings of ſome of your own ſpirits under Epiſcopacy , under the Tyranny of that government . O how acute and ſenſible were your Judgements and Conſciences then of the uſurpation , dominion , impoſed Forms , when you were the ſufferers ! but now that your Brothers are become the Nonconformists to you , as you were Non conformists to the Prelates ; and you the impoſers , and your Brothers the ſufferers ; I find times and conditions are forgotten , and yokes are called for which neither we nor our father's were able to bear . I ſee by your printings and preachings the working of new diſpoſitions in you , and Symptoms of ſomething like Dominion and Perſecution ; ſurely Brothers your crying out thus for the civil power to help you or all is undone , is a ſign you trust not to the Goſpel ſtrength , nor truth of you • way , but to the arm of fleſh . Methinks of late your Sun is turning into darkness and blackness over us , and your Moon into blood : is it poſsible that yokes , burdens , whips , priſons , baniſhments , can be ſoon forgotten ? Can Saints like natural men ſee their faces in a glass , and ſo ſoon forget what manner of men they were ? I have reaſoned with you in your own arguments ; I hope your own arguments may find access to your ſpirits when ours cannot ; men are ſooner persuaded by their own reaſon then another's . O that the ſame ſounding of bowels may be herd in you to your Brothers , that you wiſhed to hear in others who were once your taskmasters ! What Joſeph ſaid in his affliction , we ſhall ſay to you , Think on us I pray you when it ſh • ll be well with you , and show kindness ; for it may be as Mordecai ſaid , you are come to the Kingdom for ſuch a time as this ; if not , enlargement and deliverance ſhall ariſe from another place . IOHN SALTMARSH .
