To all Judges , Justices , Church-Warden , Constables , etc. YOu whom Astrea greets , were you all right , I had not been so sharp , nor had this night Been twisted into whip-cold : Was it made , To help the Jailer , or the Beadles trade ? I am your Usher , come , for here's a raze Able to bring the Hangman to disgrace . You are to find out sinners , and to give Them punishment ; that honesty might live In Courts of justice ; that the world may see ; How some of widow Truths posterity Do walk in gowns ; should favour , friends , or lies , Or fear , or bribes , blind any of your eyes ? But ah ! they do too much ! some of you nurse These Flyblown vermin , styled Englands curse . Convert not sins , nor plagues into a jest , Nor yet with mischiefs make your selves a feast . I do but move in Court , I dare not treat With upstart Plush . which since hath made so great . To Justices , and Judges , I present ( And all inferior Officers intent Upon the public good ) these humble strains , As the untutored issue of my brains , Rough with revenge ; although conceived at night , You may bring forth my black birds to the light , And heare'em chirp . Let since have no release , Which nourishes our woes , and wounds our peace .
