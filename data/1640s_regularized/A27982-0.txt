To the King . SIR , I Preſume to invite you to theſe ſacred Nuptials : the Epithalamium ſung by a crowned Muſe . Never was there Pair of ſo divine a Beauty , nor united in ſuch harmonious Affections : and infinitely he deſerved her love ; redeemed at ſo dear a Price , and enriched with ſo invaluable a Dowry . SIR , Let me find your Pardon for thus long continuing to make my Allay currant by the impreſsion of your Name . Directed by your propitious Aſpect , have I ſafely ſteered between ſo many Rocks ; and now , arrived at my laſt Harbour , have broken up my ruinous Vessel . The humbleſt of your Majeſties Servants George Sandys .
