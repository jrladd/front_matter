TO The Honourable the Knights , Citizens , and Burgesses , of the Commons House of PARLIAMENT . The humble Remonstrance and Petition of many of the Citizens of London . Showing . THat ever since the beginning of these present distractions which threaten ruins to these flourishing Kingdoms , and indeed ever since the sitting of this present Parliament , they have been ready out of their zeal to the cause of God , and sense of their duty to to this Honourable Assembly , upon all occasions to contribute subserve , and lay out themselves in all those ways , which they did either discern , or were directed , did tend to the maintenance of that Cause , or were necessary for the defence of the common safety , wherein they have at all times with all cheerfulness and readiness , advanced such moneys as have been desired , ( in the whole to very great and vast sums ) and have levied and raised among them the greatest number of those men , who both first formed and now also recruited the Army . By all which they hoped to have seen the end of their dangers and removal of their fears , by the just , severe , and exemplary punishment of Delinquents , who are the causes of all these ruining perturbations , and to have been by this time settled in the enjoyment of that happy Peace they have always desired : but deceived of this hope , they cannot omit humbly to remonstrate , that after all this vast expense , they find themselves but little nearer their end , if not more dangerously involved , and like enough to keep those intestine Wars on foot , 〈 ◊ 〉 they shortly become a prey to foreign force , as late discoveries give them cause to fear . And however they are very sensible of the great burden of renewed contributions , both beyond the example of former times , and their own expectation of such supplies ; yet they shall with the samelife and cheerfulness go on to adventure more ; so as it may be employed in a more speedy and effectual prosecution of the Wars , which they humbly conceive would not have been drawn out to this length , had it not been for giving ear to those counsels of accommodation , a proposition induced by our enemies to gain time , which if concluded , they will keep only so long as to serve their ends , but the very conclusion of it wholly incomptable , as your Remonstrants humbly conceive , with the Protestation of bringing to condign punishment these grand Delinquents , and incendiaries , who have embroiled our State , and sought to iutroduce a tyranny , without whose counsel and influence nothing on that side can be concluded , and as also the ready way to expend and wast their remaining Treasure , and render them thereby wholly unable to defend themselves . The contemplation of their eminent danger thereby , enforceth them humbly to remonstrate , that if these destructive counsels of accommodation be reassumed , they shall think it necessary to look to their own safeties , and forbear to contribute to their own ruin ; to which only accommodation , and not the greatest force of these enemies of the public peace can ever bring ; the motion whereof your Remonstrants believe , will be exploded with the greatest indignity by all the good patriors of your honourable assembly , yet humbly desire you will be pleased to publish such a Declaration herein , as shall seem good to your Wisdoms , whereby not only the people may be assured , that men misaffected to the public may not serve their own ends , or drive on their particular designs in this destructive accommodation ; but also the Ingenires of these contrivances may lie under the expectation of a just and heavy censure ; if they shall yet by such dangerous and unreasonable interpellations , to bereave us of the right and wholesome use of our advantages and opportunities ; by which for the present , beside all other dangerous effects , the Delinquents and Incendiaries are encouraged with the hope of a good retreat , when they have done their utmost . The sad effects of this accommodation appearing at distance , more terrible unto your Remonstrants then the present view of the worst of this unnatural war , gives the boldness to them , to make this humble address to this most honourable assembly : withal professing that they are resolved with the utmost expense of Lives , and estates to stand by , assist , maintain , and execute all your counsels and command • , that shall tend to the vigorous and effectual prosecution of this War . They therefore humbly pray you will be pleased to declare your Sense against this dangerous accommodation , that being assured of your fixed resolution not to treat with his Majesty , but in parliament , and divided from his wicked and desperate Councillors , they may with the greater resolution be prepared to go on cheerfully in such supplies , as are necessary to bring these distractions to a happy issue . For which they shall ever pray , etc.
