To the Right Honourable THOMAS Lord WINDSOR , etc. My LORD : THE assurance the Author of these Poems received of his Worth from your Honour , in his life time , was not rather a mark of his desert , than a perfect demonstration of your Noble love to him : Which consideration , has raised my bold desire to assume presumption , to present these to your Honour , in the person of one deceased ; the form whereof somewhat dispersed , yet carry with them the Prerogative of truth to be Mr. Ben : Ionsons ; and will so appear to all , whose Eyes , and Spirits are rightly placed . You are ( my Lord ) a Person who is able to give valve and true esteem to things of themselves no less deserving : such were his , strong , and as far transcendent ordinary imagination , as they are conformable to the sense of such who are of found judgement : his Strenuous Lines , and sinewey Labours have raised such Piramydes to his lasting name , as shall outlast Time . And that these may , without any diminution to the glory of his greater Works , enjoy the possession of public favour , ( by your Honours permission ) I shall be glad by this small Testimony account it a fit opportunity to assure your Honour , my Lord , that I am Your most humble and affectionate Servant , JOHN BENSON .
