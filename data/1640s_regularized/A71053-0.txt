To the Reverend Divines now convened by Authority of Parliament , for Conſultation in matters of RELIGION . I Have but the thoughts of and afternoon to ſpread before you , for I examined the ſame pace that I read ; that if it were poſſible , a truth might overtake and error ere it god too far . It is not a little encouragement that I may fit like the Prophetess under the Palmtree , under ſuch a ſhade as your ſelves ; and what weakness ſoever may appear in theſe my aſſertions , This airing them under your Patronage will heal them , for ſo they brought forth the ſick into the ſtreets , that at leaſt the ſhadow of Peter might touch ſome of them . Thus have I ſuddenly ſet up my Candle for others to light their Torch at ; and I hope you will pardon me , if my zeal to the truth , made me ſee another's faults ſooner than my own . Your Servant in Chriſt Jeſus JOHN SALTMARSH .
