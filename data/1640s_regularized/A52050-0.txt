TO THE HONOURABLE The House of COMMONS Now Assembled in PARLIAMENT . IT hath been much lamented by learned men , that the times wherein things have been done in the world , are no more truly computed , and that thereby all Histories of times are very imperfect , Apud quos ratio temporis non cohaeret , apud illos neque veritatis neque fidei historicae ratio ulla constare potest ; How much more is it to be lamented , that so few have any understanding of the times in reference to the things which concern their everlasting peace ? because no less mischief then ruin of souls , of Nations and Churches avoidable break in upon them , who know not the time of their visitation ; If this plain Sermon may help this way to mend the times , and promote the right and best study of them , especially if God vouchsafe to bless it to be in any degree useful to you in your great work , for whose Meridian it was calculated , for whose use it was composed , to whom it was preached , and by whose order it is now made public , it will be a great comfort to the spirit , and a blessed answer from heaven to the Prayers of Your unworthy and most devoted Servant , STEPHEN MARSHALL .
