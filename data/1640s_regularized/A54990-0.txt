This Epiſtle and Preface shows Catoes beſt rules for a Plantation . To the Right Honourable and mighty Lord Edmund by Divine Providence Lord Proprieter , Earl Palatine , Governor and Captain General of the Province of New Albion , and to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Monſon of Caſtlemain , the Lord Sherard Baron of Letrim : and to all other the Viscounts , Barons , Baronets , Knights , Gentlemen , Merchant's , Adventurers , and Planters of the hopeful Company of New Albion , in all 44 undertakers and ſubſcribers , bound by Indenture to bring and ſettle 3000 able trained men in our ſaid several Plantations in the ſaid Province . Beauchamp Plantagenet of Belvil in New Albion Eſquire , one of the Company , wishes all health , happiness , and heavenly bleſſings . May it pleaſe your good Lordship's and fellow Adventurers , HAving been blaſted with the whirlwind of this late , unnatural and civil Engliſh war , ſeeing the Storm more likely to increase then to calm , I recollected my former Journal and Manual notes of my Travails by Land and Sea forty years ſince in Italy , France , Germany , Poland , and Belgia , and finding Omne ſolum forti patria , ut piſcibus aequor ; I peruſed all the books of any Engliſh Colonies , and by often conferences of the traders and reſident planters , of the preſent ſtate , condition , numbers , enemies , bad neighbours , air , health government , fortification and safety , religion , quietness , profit , and returns , ſhipping for supply and vent of the growing commodities ; I conferred with my fellow patients , 7 Knights and Gentlemen , my kindred and neighbours , and reporting the true ſtate of all our Colonies ; and while thus muſing I ſtood at a maze unreſolved , the ſtorm grew far more tempeſtuous with thunder and lightning , black and terrible guſts , and ſpouts , that made the rivers riſe , and my friends to hide : for the roaring Cannon beatrice down their walls and houſes , the Muſqueteers , Dragoons ▪ and Piſtold horſemen ſwept all Cattle and their goods afore them ; the Pikemen in their enclosures and retreats , left them no beds , pots or pans ; their ſilver plate was turned into earthen diſhes : New names , and terms , like and unknown language , and like to ſtrange people unheard of in all the Globe as far as our Antipodes , called Cavaliers , Presbyters , Independents , Roundheads , and Malignants , like the Gothes , Huns , and Vandalls , and Alans , that invaded and conquered Italy , Spaine , and France ; and like the Saxons , Jutes , and Angles , that conquered Britanny . Theſe having plundered , and put upon us new Laws and Ordinances , called Contribution , Exciſe , Quartering , and Sequeſtrations , my friends were now and rightly by Gods Providence made light , and not troubled or encumbered with much stuff to travel with , nor Farms , Tenements , or Copyholds , and for our ſins our pride abated , our hearts humbled : our afflictions made us pray heartily , and call to God to direct us to infuſe contrition and true ſorrow , and purpoſe of amendment to follow his calling . we found this ſtorm and heavy judgement had likewiſe afflicted Scotland , Ireland , Man , Jarſey , and Garaſey Iſles . Then peruſing my old evidences , I found my Ancestor Sir Richard Plantagenes had Chawton , Blendworth , Clanfield , and Catrington in Hampſhire . But in thoſe Civil-wars in Henry the ſixth time , much like theſe or that of the Guelfs and Gibellines in Italy , all was loſt . I reſolved to be a Neuter in this quarrel , not to kill Engliſh men and Chriſtians , but with Chriſt to fly into Egypt , and like the Apoſtle Paul to fly out of one City into another , and get out of the fire : At laſt my ſeven Knights and Gentlemen employed me the oldeſt and boldeſt Traveller to ſee all Engliſh Plantations , by warrant to buy land in the healthieſt and beſt for us eight , and for a hundred ſervants , and twenty of our old tenants and families . But in my private inſtructions , I was on a full and deliberate counsel directed to follow old Catoes rules in ſeating of the Roman Colonies , begun to be ſeated to ſave charge of Garriſons in new Conqueſts . Firſt , to ſeat in a healthy pure air : elſe after all the hazard , charge and building passed , their people die , and their poſterity extinguiſh , and their children inherit ficknes & weakness . Secondly , to fit down in a freſh navigable river for trade and ſupply , where there was ſtone near to built , and not to built on wood ſubject to firing of enemies , negligence of ſervants , or treachery of ſlaves and apprentices ; for this reaſon I on my view of Virginia , diſliked Virginia , moſt of it being ſeated ſcatteringly in wooden clove board houſes , where many by fire were undone , and by two maſſacres in and inſtant fired , without any forts there , or retreats of ſafety in time of danger , and ſeated amongſt Saltmarches and Creeks , where thrice worſe then Eſſex , and Tenet , and Kenned for agues and diſeaſes , brackiſh water to drink and uſe ; and a flat Country , and ſtanding waters in woods bred a double corrupt air , ſo the elements corrupted , no wonder as the old Virginians affirm , the sickness there the firſt thirty years to have killed 100000 men . And then generally five of ſix imported died , and now in Iune , Iuly and Auguſt chiefly , one in nine die imported , abſent a year and returning : though much land more now is cleared and victual and cattle mendeth the diet . Thirdly , Catoes and the third Roman rule was to ſeat in rich land ſo that the richness of the place and nearness of husbandry may continue the Colony with plenty and ſafety : this alſo Virginia for the moſt part wants , they living in ſalts , and moſt of their lands after two crops is a light hight earth , which kills barley with the hight ground and Sun in May . Thus inſtructed I viewed Barbadoes and Saint Chriſtophers , Bermudoes , New England , and Virginia , and Maryland ; Saint Chriſtophers I find worn out , two parts full of French aliens ſubject to blaſt it , and winds blowing away Cotton , wanting victuals , and no ſtore of land ; Barbadoes hath ſome rich men , having Sugar mills , Indico , Ginger , Suckets of Oranges and Lemons , and bad Tobacco ; but their usual bred is of Caſſada roots , whoſe juice is poison , ſo the negligence of a ſervant or ſlave in the right making of it may coſt the whole family a poisoning ; the ſervants usual food is ſome Peas , Potatoes , Roots , and thoſe boiled make their drink called Mobby and Plantana roots ; ſome rich have Poultry , and Hogs , and Cows tied up to trees , for there are few Ranges and Enclosures . Theſe two laſt years the plague as I am informed killed 10000 brave people , and there are many hundred Rebel Negro flaves in the woods ; here was no ſtore of land for our 120 men and their families , here wants the Engliſh men grass , and ſo the Engliſh men Beef , Mutton , Milk , Butter and Cheeſe , and they want rivers to turn their Sugar mills , ſo that New England sends Horſes , and Virginia Oxen , to turn them at exceſſive rates , and their keeping is there chargeable , and at Barbadoes they buy much Beef and Meal , and Peas , and Fiſh from New England , and other places , yet this Iſle is full of gallant people , very civil and well governed , and now no fear of the Spaniard being ſo populous . Then I touched at Bermudoes , and Iſle twenty miles long , and two miles over ; and in ſome places more guarded with Rocks and Iſles , difficult in access , full of Figs , Oranges , Lemons , Pomcitrons , Potatoes , and Plantans , Mays wheat for bred , excellent Fiſh , Tobacco and Peas ; healthy it is and quiet in government ; But this Iſle being but a pretty priſon , was not for my Companies uſe . Thence I ſailed to New England , where I found three months ſnow , hard winter , but lean land , in general all along the Sea coaſt well peopled Towns , the people very thirsty , induſtrious , and temperate ; their fiſh carried to Bilbao , and Saint Sebaſtans , their Pipestaves to the Iſles and Spain , and the corn of the floated river of Connectacute is tranſported , and the Beaver trade is their beſt ſubſiſtence . Still hoping for a richer and more temperate soil , I went to Virginia , paſſing 310 miles along the shores and Iſles of New Albion , by Manhatas Iſle , by Long Iſle , Cape May , and the two Capes of Deleware Bay , by the leſſer and ſouthermoſt , being by our Seamen's obſervations juſt in 38 degrees , and 40 minutes , and ſo by Chingotto , and Fe • z Iſles in Maryland to Virginia , to Newports News , where receiving kind entertainment at Captain Matthews , at Maſter Fantleroys , and free quarter in all places , finding the Indian war ended , firſt by the valour , courage , and hight charge of Captain Marshal , and valiant Stilwel , and finiſhed by the personal and reſolute March and Victory of Sir William Berkley Governor , there taking the old King open Chankino priſoner , I wandered all over , finding no place for the reaſons aforeſaid fit for our Company : I went to Chicacoen , the North part of Virginia on Pawtomeck river , dividing it and Maryland , which I found healthier and better then Virginia , but then it was in war both with the Saſquehannocks , & all the Eaſtern Bay Indians , and a Civil war between ſome revolters proteſtants , aſſiſted by 50 plundered Virginians , by whom M. Leonard Calvert Governor under his brother the Lord Baltamore , was taken priſoner and expelled : and the Iſle of Kent taken from him alſo by Captain Clayborn of Virginia ; yet I viewed Kent Iſle , too wet , and plaſhy , having bad water , but there and at Chicacoen , and at Accomack in Virginia , and chiefly in New England , they related of the excellent temper , and pure air , fertility of soil , of hills that ſheltered off the Northwest winds , and blaſts , valleys of grapes , rich mines , and millions of Elkes , Stags , Deer , Turkeys , Fowl , Fiſh , Cotten , rare fruits , Timber , and fair plains , & clear fields , which other Plantations want , this excelling all others : & finding it lay juſt midway between Virginia , too hight and aguiſh in the blaſted plains on one ſide , and the cold New England on the other , and in the ſame elevation of Naples , the Garden of Europe , after one hunting voyage and view 60 miles on one ſide of Albion , and 310 miles on the other ſide , and Long Iſle , finding the countries better and pleaſanter then related , I made my addreſſes to the Lord Governor of Albion , and having obtained under the Province Seal my grant of my Manor of Belvill containing 10000 acres , on a navigable river , having in it and near , Alabaster , Terras for plaster of Paris , Building and Slatſtone , ſtore of Timber , clear Fields , Meads and Woods , and no Indians near , and Vines , I reſolved to return to Holland , and to tranſport my friends , where moſt happily the ſecond time meeting his Lordſhip , and peruſing by his noble favour , all his Lordship's Cards , and Seamens draughts , 17 journal books of diſcoveries , voyages , huntings , tradings , and several depoſitions under ſeal of the great Beaver , and fur trade , rich mines , and many ſecrets and rarities . In fourteen days having with the two former books printed of Albion 1637 , and 1642. made a full abſtract and collection , agreeing with my own view & in the Depoſitions , and M. Evelins , and other the traders of Virginia & New England , I thought it moſt neceſſary for the good of all the Company , and many Vounteers in Holland , diſtreſſed in England , and noble Knights , Gentlemen , that with a little ſtock may gain fair and rich poſſeſſions , and live in peace and quiet , to print and publiſh this my labour under all your Lordship's Protections , moſt humbly craving your Lordship's gentle acceptance . And becauſe it conduceth much for a General & a Leader , to be known of his Commanders and Soldiers , his abilities , and virtues , and excellent parts drawing more men of honour and valour to follow him ; it contenting much men of honour and dignity to be led and commanded by a better and more honourable , and more ſufficient then themſelves , and not their inferior : the meaner and poorer ſort expecting all encouragement , juſtice and protection , and all the Company , the Adventures , and ſtrangers to us all , may more freely and cheerfully go on , and ſet out their men , and expect the more and better returns & contentment , under his government , in whom Pietic , Religion , Honour , Juſtice , Learning , Valour , Judgement , Temperance , and Policy ſhines ; hope without offence or imputation of flattery , to affirm his virtues more then the gems of the Coronet of this our Earl Palatine , do adorn his noble parts . Since to me conſcientiamea mille rests , I have had the honour to be admitted as his familiar , have marched , lodged , and cabbined together , amongſt the Indians & in Holland , have ſeen ſo many of his Manuſcript Books , and moſt excellent Rules and Obſervations of Law , Juſtice , Policy , I found his converſation as ſweet and winning , as grave and ſober , adorned with much Learning , enriched with ſixe Languages , moſt grounded and experienced in foreign matters of State policy , and government , trade and ſea voyages , by 4 years travel in Germany , France , Italy and Belgium , by 5 years living and Officer in Ireland , and this laſt 7 years in America , his study and ſuits at home and abroad enabling his impartial and infallible judgement of Judicature , and certainly his perfect knowledge of his 23 Indian Kings , under the command of this our Lord Royal , as of his good and bad neighbours , their power , wealth and weakness , Engliſh Aliens and Indians appears by his notes and books , where none of their treacheries , plots , conſpiracies , haltings and villainies , their Antagoniſts , their numbers and abilities , the advantage of our arms and fights , and ſtratagerns are as Greek phalanges and they as Roman Manuples and enemies to ſide with ; and how to quiet and regain , kill , or ſurpriſe them , is not expreſſed . What Port , Bay and ſoundings , Creek , river , rock , quarries of ſtone , ſlat , Iron mines , Gum-Dragoon , Led , Gold , and Silver , Alabaster , Terras Bolarmack , read ſoap earth , Terra-lemnia , Dyers ware , Herbs and Plants , and their uſe , Ocar , Rudle , Cinnaber for quickſilver , and Vermilion , is not in particular , Cards by compass , and ſcale in books , with the trials and witneſſes recorded . What land and ſea profit , fiſhing , place for ſalt , Potas Die , Fruits Herbs and Plants , clear Fields , great Plains , fine and thick Grass , Marſhes , necks of land , rich , black , moulded countries for Tobacco , Flax , Rice , choice Trees , and Timber for Shipping , and Pipeſtaves , Maſts , Yards , Pitch , Tar , sheltered places for Grapes and Fruits ; Cotten in Cotten river , invincible places by nature , others by a little charge and fort to be made impregnable , is not in this huge and waſte Province , being 1000 mile compass delineated ; and what Law or Policy , and ſummary Juſtice , Courts of Law , Equity , Appeals , Awards , or references , fit to compoſe differences , reconcile debates , to unite hearts , to ſettle the factious and ſeditious in any other Engliſh Colonies or Countries , and fit for our Juſtice , is not explained . Therefore my good Lords and Adventurers , ſince I ſpeak of knowledge by view , and certain reports of wiſe and knowing men , I ſhall joy and congratulate with you all , in ſo able , ſufficient , and honourable a Governor , happily to rule , to defend , and do us juſtice ; a tried and ſeaſoned man , and excellent Pilot in all this Land and Seas , not afeard in perſon as a true Captain General by Land and Sea , to lead and ſettle us by Boat , Horſe or Foot , as able and willing as any of the meaneſt ; and therefore I think at firſt it moſt material to express the Law , Statutes , and Judgements , and Acts of Parliament of Counts , and Count Palatines , and County Palatines , and of our Province and County Palatine , Liberties , and the ancient family 1200 year from the Saxons in England , of our Earl Palatine , his pedigree and alliance . And ſince according as other Palatines , as he of Cheſter and Dureſme , made their Barons and Knights , as therein many are yet living , you my Lord have begun to honour firſt your own children , I tender my beſt reſpects unto your Lps son and heir apparent Francis Lord Ployden , Baron of Mount Royal , D. Governor , and to Thomas Lord Ployden , Baron of Roymont , High Admiral : and to the Lady Winefrid Baroness of Vvedale , the pattern of mildness and modeſty ; and to the Lady Barbara , Baroneſſe of Ritchneck , the mirror of wit and beauty , and to the Lady Katherine Baroness of Princeport , that pretty babe of grace , whoſe fair hands I kiss , hoping on your Lordship's invitation C. C. T. and your two Baronets L. and M. to get them as they promiſed to go with us . I hope to get your Knights and 200 Planters on this ſide ready . And thus with tender of my ſervice to your Lordship's , and all the Company , I reſt Your humbleſt ſervant , BEAUCHAMP PLANTAGENET . Middleboro this 5 of Decemb. 1648.
