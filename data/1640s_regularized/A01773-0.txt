To the great hope of growing nobleness , my Honourable friend , Sir Thomas Fisher , Knight , etc. Sir , THe knowledge of your still increasing virtue has begotten in all men love , in me admiration , and desires to serve it : as cunning Painters express more significant Art in model , then extended figures , I have made election of this little of spring of my brain , to show you the largest skill of my many endearments to you ; and as and Ambassador from the rest of my faculties , to inform you how much devotion the whole province of my Soul pays to your worth and goodness . Had I been endowed with such blessings , ( noble young man ) I should have presented you a welmand Hawke , or and excellent Cour â€¢ er , gifts ( because more agreeable to your Disposition ) more fit to have been tendered you : But I am confident you know that a Book ( as it is my best inheritance ) is the most magnificent sacrifice my zeal can offer : this Play therefore accept , best Sir , from him who is nothing more ambitious then of the title of your true servant and honourer , Hen . Glapthorne ,
