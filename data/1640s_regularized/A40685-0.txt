TO THE HONOURABLE and truly noble Sr. JOHN D'ANVERS Knight . Sir , THis small Sermon may well be termed Zoar , for is it not a little one ? Yet it bears good proportion to the short text ; on which it discourseth ; little auditory for which it was composed , and your private Chapel wherein it was delivered . As it is small , so it desired to be secret , and intended no appearance in public . Good was the counsel which Jaash gave Amaziah . 2 Cro. 25. 19. Abide now at home , especially in our dangerous days , when all going , is censurable for gadding abroad without a necessary vocation . But seeing such was your importunity , to have it Printed , that all my excuses to the contrary , which I could allege with truth , and the delays , which I could make with manners , might not prevail : I have chosen rather to be accounted undiscreet then uncivil , and have yielded to your desire . Surely Sir , Heaven can never return a denial to your requests whom I presume , ( by proportion of your earnest desiring so small a matter ) to be zealous in your desires of hire concernment , that nothing but a grant can give you satisfaction . But the mainest motive , next your importunity , which put me on this public adventure , was the consideration of my engagements to your noble bounty , above my possibility of deserving it . The Apostle with it is part of the duty of a good servant , Tit. 2. v. 9. 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 , not answering again . I must confess my self your Servant , and therefore it ill beseemed me to dislike or mutter against any thing you was pleased I should do . Thus desiring the continuance and increase of all spiritual and temporal happiness on your honour . I commend you to the Almighty . T. F.
