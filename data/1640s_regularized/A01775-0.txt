To the true Example of Heroic Virtue , and Favourer of Arts , Sir FREDERICK CORNWALLIS . SIR : YOu are so well acquainted with the Justice of Nobility , that your own Fame is your own History : you are writ in that Sir . Nor need I study to express it in a larger Character , since it is texted already in a Volume , time ( which is Edaxrerum ) cannot exterminate . Think not , worthiest Sir , this can in me be flattery ; your worth admits none : nor dare I fell my self to such a slavery , as to begin my service to You with that unmanly prostitution : You have always afforded me such transcendent favours , that I should descend to ingratitude , should not I study a retribution : which though I cannot reach at , accept Sir , I beseech you , this Essay of gratitude from Your most obliged honourer , Hen : Glapthorne .
