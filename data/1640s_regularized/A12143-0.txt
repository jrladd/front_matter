To the hopeful pair of noble brother's , Cornet George Porter , and Mr. Charles Porter . THe knowledge of your growing virtues , have begotten in all men love , in me admiration , and a desire to serve the manifold obligations I have to the true Example of worth Captain Endemion Porter , instructed me to this presentation of my devoted respects to your noble selves , the true Ideas of his virtues . You are so equal in all the attributes of goodness , that it were a difficult endeavour for me to distinguish between your perfections : Only noble Captain that prioraty which your birth has allowed you , engages me in the first place to tender my service to your self , which I imagined could not have been really accomplished , had I not joined your brother in this act of my gratitude to you . Accept therefore heroic pair of brother's , this tender of his best devotions â–ª to you who has no greater ambition then to be esteemed , the true servant of both your virtues W. A.
