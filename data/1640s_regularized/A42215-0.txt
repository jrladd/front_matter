TO THE RIGHT Worshipful SIR PAUL PINDAR Knight . YOur well known goodness which makes you admired & praiſed by every one , excited long ſince a deſire in me to testify unto the world , and your ſelf , that though a ſtranger unto you , yet I was not ſuch a ſtranger in the city , but that I had herd and taken notice of your daily pious and charitable works . So that this my tranſlation being to go forth into the view of the world , I have made bold to dedicate it unto you for two cauſes . The firſt , my deſire to make known unto you that you had and unknown ſervant , who had long wiſhed for ſome opportunity whereby he might manifeſt the deſire he had to tender his ſervice unto you . The ſecond , to make this poor work more acceptable to the world , by prefixing your beloved name in the front of it , which is greater in the world's esteem , Quam cui poſſit invidia nocere . Your courteous and noble mind will ( I hope ) not disdain the gift , though ſo small that it merits not ſo great a Patron : I promiſing ere long to preſent you with ſomething which ſhall be mine own invention . So wiſhing you many happy days , forerunners of eternal happiness , I reſt , Your Worſhips moſt devoted ſervant , Robert Gentilis .
