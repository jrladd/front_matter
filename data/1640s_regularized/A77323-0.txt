To the Worshipful William Barkeley , Alderman of London , and one of the Commiſſioners for the receipt of Customs . Worthy Sir : I Have in my troubles ( among other things ) obſerved that when the LordJob 12. 5. deprives a man of the ſuperfluous things of this life , Lam. 3. 2. and brings him into distress , Pro. 19. 7. his friends and acquaintance are then wanting unto him , Pſal . 38. 11. they ſtand aloof , Job 10. 1. and leave him to himself , being ( in their opinions ) in ſo miſerable a ſtate and condition ; Deut. 8. 5. this is the usual manner of Gods dealing with thoſe whom he loves , for by this means,2 Cor. 4. 16. though the outward man periſh , yet the inward man is renewed day by day . But when the Lord is graciouſly pleaſed to Jonah . 4. 6. deliver the party afflicted from his grief , Pſal . 90. 15. he is exceeding glad , and then hisJob 42. 11. friends and acquaintance rejoice with him , and express their love and affections towards him in a bountiful manner : Pſal . 116. 5 , 6. this have I ( through Gods goodness ) known by experience , eſpecially theſe latter times : Pſal . 5. 12. for many are the courteſies which I have received from diverse friends,1 Cor. 16. 18 the which I ſhall ever acknowledge . But the truth is , the continuance ofPſal . 112. 5. your great favours , is ſuch a happiness to me , as I muſt needs confess you are to me more like a Job 29. 16. father then a friend or maſter . And therefore and ſo much the more obliged unto you . Pro. 18. 24. In teſtimony thereof , and of the true love and ſervice I owe you , I humbly dedicate to you theſe firſt fruits of my poor endeavours , gathered in my aforeſaid troubles , ( when I wasJer . 32. 2. ſhut up in a miſerable place from the delights of the world ) out ofCant . 5. 1. the spiritual garden of Gods Word ; wherefore my hope is you willPſal . 119. 103. reliſh them ſo much the better , and vouchſafe them your kind acceptance , though publiſhed by ſo weak and Inſtrument as my self , whoſe further endeavours ( notwithſtanding ) ſhall be to do ſomewhat more ſome other way , that may conduce to the public welfare , as God ( theJam . 1. 5. 17. liberal giver of all good gifts ) ſhall enable me : To whom I commit both you and all yours , and remain , Your Worſhips moſt humble ſervant , William Bagwell .
