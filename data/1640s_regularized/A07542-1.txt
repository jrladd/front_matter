To his Friend , H. M. HOnour is due to him that does advance , Undoubted truth , with lively circumstance . Much of this skill this Author hath found out ; PVts Sinto silence : questions out of doubt . HAving pursued the cause of desolation , RAising the hearts sweetly with meditation . YOur souls may see , their enemies descried , MAns wit is pliable , truly sanctified , IN laying siege , against sin , thy Poetry , LEaves it accursed , in hellish destiny . LEt not thy conquest die , let's know the thing , SAlly forth little book , fear no deadly sting .
