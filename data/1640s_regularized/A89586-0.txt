TO THE HONOURABLE Houſe of COMMONS , now aſſembled in PARLIAMENT . Honourable , and Beloved , THe holy King and Prophet David , required that the praises of God ſhould be ſung upon well tuned Inſtruments ; and ſome Psalms which himſelf compoſed to that purpoſe , he ſtyled Michtam , golden Pſalms ; as being full of precious and choice treaſure . Such could I have wiſhed might the Inſtrument have been , and ſuch the Song of Praiſe and Thankſgiving , to have celebrated the goodness of God , for this late wonderful preſervation of your Honourable Aſſembly , and the famous , and worthy City ; both whoſe ruin was plotted and deſigned by wicked and unreaſonable men . But you were pleaſed , not only to design to this ſervice , a weak and untuned Inſtrument , ( though not Cracked , as Malice , and Slander hath bruited it abroad ) but alſo to enjoin the publiſhing of this ſong of Thankſgiving , which is full of weak and imperfect Notes . And to this latter task , I was ( I confess ) far more unwilling then to the former ; as being conſcious unto my ſelf , how few conceptions could be brought by me to any ſuch maturity , as might render them meet to become the ſtanding Monument of ſo great a Mercy , and ſo happy a Day , which is worthy to be engraven on Marble , rather then to be written on Paper , and with letters of gold , rather then with ink : But in the purſuance of your Commands I have done it , and added ſome few things , which time nor ſtrength would permit Some few inſtances , clearing the main Doctrine , and ſome in largement of the firſt Uſe . me to deliver in public ; Being reſolved to deny my ſelf , and to do nothing that may hinder me from being what I am , and ſhall always deſire to remain , Yours wholly in the ſervice of Chriſt and his Church , STEPHEN MARSHALL .
