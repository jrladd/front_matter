To the Worshipful , and his honorred Kinsman , Robert Ducie , of Aston , in the County of Stafford Esquire : Son to Sir Robert Ducie , Knight and Baronet Deceased . Sir , NOt to boast of any perfections , I have never yet been Owner of Ingratitude , and would be loath Envy should tax me now ; having at this time opportunity to pay part of that debt I owe your love . This Tragedy had at the presentment a general Applause ; yet I have not that want of modesty , as to conclude it wholly worthy your Patronage ; although I have been bold to fix your name unto it . Yet however , your Charity will be famous in protecting this Plant , from the breath of Zoilus ; and forgiving this my confidence : and your acceptance cherish a study of a more deserving Piece , to quit the remainder of the engagement : In Your Kinsman ready to serve you â–ª Thomas Rawlins .
