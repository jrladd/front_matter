TO THE TRULY NOBLE MAGNANIMOUS AND ILLUSTRIOUS LORD , IAMES , EARLE OF MONTROSE , Lord GRAHAME , Baron of MURDOCK , etc. Illustrious LORD , IF grateful duty , may be reputed the child of reason , then ( doubtless ) my choicest wishes , and best Affection , must here fallen prostrate before your auspicious and friendly face , fast chained , in the fetters of obedience . Flattery and Ingratitude I disdain as hell : And to court your Lo : with elegant phrases , were indeed as much as who would light a Candle , to light the Sun : Your Noble and Heroic Virtues light this Kingdom , and who can give them light : For , as the Aurore , of your honoured reputation , is become that Constantinopolitan Hyppodrome , to this our Northern and virgin Albion ; so likewise , the same singularity of worth , hath raised your auspicious self , to be the monumental glory of your famous , and valiant Predecessors , justly termed , THE SWORD OF SCOTLAND : Your morning of their Summer's day hath fully enlarged , the sacred Trophies of their matchless memory ; best befitting the generosity of your magnanimous mind . That as the GRAHAME , from long antiquity , being the most ancient surname , of this unconquered Nation ; so they , your old aged Ancestors , have left a lineal construction of their Valour and Worthiness , to be inherent in your most hopeful personage , which God may long continue to you , your Raze , and your Posterity . My humble request , pleads the continuance of your favour , that as your late renowned Grandfather and Father , were unto me both friendly and favourable ( proceeding from their great goodness , not my deserts ; ) so expect I the same from your tender bounty , which hitherto beyond my merit , hath been exceeding kyndlie manifested . For the which , my praise and prayers , the two sisters of mine Oblation , rest solidly ingenochiated at the feet of your conspicuous Clemency . This present work in its secret Infancy , was both seen and perused by your Lo : but now enlarged , polished , and published : I have done my best , though not my uttermost : The discourse it self , runneth most on the causes , conditions , and remedies of since , and they sharply linked in generals and particulars : The whole substance of my labours , sealing up the happiness of a sinners conversion to God , under the mourning Canopy , of Tears , and Repentance . The lines are plain , yet pithy ; and although the subject may carry no lofty nor PoÃ«ticke style ; yet themanner , the matter , the Man , and his Muse , are all , and only yours , and I left theirs , only to serve you , and your noble disposition . Accept therefore my good Lord , both the gift , and givers mind , with the same alacrity , as I offer them in Love and humility ; which being shelterd under your pious and prudent Patronage , shall enforce me to remain , as I vow ever to be , while I have being , Your Honours most obsequious and most obser vant Orator , WILLIAM LITHGOVV .
