TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM LORD Viscount SAY , and Seal Master of his Highness Court of Wards and Liveries , and one of his Majesties most Honourable privy Counsel . MY LORD , THe several concurrent attempts which were made of late upon the settled doctrine and discipline of our Church begotten jealous conceits in me , that either our Religion had been hitherto erroneous , or was likely to prove unsure for the future . Some blame , me thought , was due either to former times , that they had not been wise in receding from Room so far as they had done , or to the present for not being sincere in returning so fast back again . To excuse both 〈 … 〉 secure in points of so great concernment , 〈 ◊ 〉 , and tenderness of conscience would not permit , and to be rash in my censure without search , and diligent study seemed unjust , and unchristian : wherefore that I might purchase to my self being thus perplexed just and fair satisfaction , and ex • ricate my self out of the mischieves of stupidity and temerity both , I did seriously addict my self notwithstanding the dissuasions of my own particular profession , interest and want of 〈 … 〉 debate , ventilate , and examine the novelties of the time . And verily , as to my self , my endeavours were not long successesse , for I did at last perceive that there was more danger in our innovators then depth in our Innovations : and as to some others not injudicious , I found them concurring with me in opinion , and encouraging me withal to make my observations more public . My Lord , I know none more desirous to diffuse good then your Honour , nor scarce any better mean whereby to diffuse it to others then your 〈 … 〉 wherefore I beseech this as and addition to 〈 ◊ 〉 former favours , that I may 〈 … 〉 Honoured Name , whereby to make more acceptable to all good men thesepoore endeavours of Your most gratefully devoted servant and Allies-man H.
