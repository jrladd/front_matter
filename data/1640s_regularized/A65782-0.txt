To the WORSHIPFUL , Robert Tracy , Esq Coronet of Horsemen to the Right Honourable , Edward , Viscount Conoway , Lord General of the Horse . SIR , AS your worth is known in many parts here at home , so from many parts abroad , MERCVRY is come to be known of you . It was the prime praise of Vlisses , that he had seen many Cities , and known the manners or minds of many men : If there be any true content and pleasure of the mind here on earth , it is gained in travel and the view of variety of places ; beside those brave spirits that love to see the world abroad , are of another mould than our dull drones that keep their homes and their hives , and , except smoked out , will scarce fly over to the next field ; when the other imitating the celestial bodies , as Lipsius says , Gaudent motu , delight in motion , and bring home the sweet honey of Experience , whereby they become most useful above any other to their King and Country . I shall not need to touch the manifold use of Travel , or relate that unto you , which you know above many others ; being as one said of Hermogenes , Senex in ipsa juventute , endued with virtuous and many excellent parts above your years . I dare not be over tedious or troublesome , only I desire you would be pleased to entertain our MERCVRY , with no other respect and good will , than he in all love and duty , tenders himself and his service unto you . Your most devoted and obliged , James Wadsworth .
