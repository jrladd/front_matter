To the Students Of the Inns of Court . GEentlemen , Matter is better than words . If you be noble , worthy , and ingenuous , theſe many precipitations I here diſcover , need no other effect than honeſt pity : but if theſe endowments of the mind be excluded , either by the rashness of Youth ( and ill Tutor ) ; or by violent prodigality and licentiousness , ( a worſe Diſciple ) ; My deſire is , that my ſerious lightness , may arrow-like pierce your Conſciences , to and unfeigned repentance . The more you are contriſtate , the less will be your ſorrow ; for to lament , is here to rejoice : and ſuch joy I wiſh may be accumulated on you , and on all thoſe , that either love goodness , or are estranged from it . The reaſon why I preſent this Book in chief to you ( after the interested Dedication ) is , becauſe being my self , of one of your Societies , my obſervation and experiment hath made me conjecture , that theſe two ſhould never be unwelcome , Advice and Delight . The first whereof , if my Book do not instruct , yet mine own deviation ( ſtill known to many ) may , ſeeing there is no ſtability in bubbling pleaſure , nor no true content without a religious return ; ſo you have both precept and example . And as for the latter , it is better wished than deſcribed . Reade and judge . The Honourer of your virtues , Richard Croſhaw .
