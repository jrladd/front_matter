THE STATIONER TO THE READER . IT is not any private reſpect of gain , Gentle Reader , for the ſlighteſt Pamphlet is now adays more vendible then the Works of learnedeſt men ; but it is the love I have to our own Language that hath made me diligent to collect , and ſet forth ſuch Pieces both in Proſe and Vers , as may renew the wonted honour and eſteem of our Engliſh tongue : and it's the worth of theſe both Engliſh and Latin Poems , not the flouriſh of any prefixed encomions that can invite thee to buy them , though theſe are not without the higheſt Commendations and Applauſe of the learnedest Academics , both domestic and foreign : And among thoſe of our own Country , the unparalleled atteſtation of that renowned Provost of Eaton , Sir Henry Wootton : I know not thy palate how it reliſhes ſuch dainties , nor how harmonious thy ſoul is ; perhaps more trivial Airs may pleaſe thee better . But howſoever thy opinion is ſpent upon theſe , that encouragement I have already received from the moſt ingenious men in their clear and courteous entertainment of Mr. Wallers late choice Pieces , hath once more made me adventure into the World , preſenting it with theſe evergreen , and not to be blaſted Laurels . The Authors more peculiar excellency in theſe ſtudies , was too well known to conceal his Papers , or to keep me from attempting to solicit them from him . Let the event guide it ſelf which way it will , I ſhall deſerve of the age , by bringing into the Light as true a Birth , as the Muſes have brought forth ſince our famous Spencer wrote ; whoſe Poems in theſe Engliſh ones are as rarely imitated , as ſweetly excelled . Reader if thou art Eagle-eyed to cenſure their worth , I am not fearful to expoſe them to thy exacteſt peruſal . Thine to command HUMPH . MOSELEY .
