TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL , the Lady IANE COVERT , of Peper Harrow in Surry . MADAM , CVstome hath made it not only pardonable , but necessary to flatter in Dedicatory Epistles , Epitaphs , and Dedications , are credited alike . But I will not follow the stream herein : First , because I account it beneath my calling , to speak any thing above the truth . Secondly , because of you it is needless : Let deformed Faces be beholding to the Painter , Art hath nothing to do , where Nature hath prevented it . Wherefore I will turn my praising of you , into prayer for you , desiring God to strengthen and increase all goodness in you , and give you perseverance ( that golden Clasp ) which joins Grace and Glory together . Thus desiring to shroud my weak labours , under your favourable Patronage . I rest Your Ladyships in all service , Thomas Fuller .
