Sir , IN a Perſon of ſo great Worth as Your ſelf , Virtue and Goodness muſt needs be not only diffuſive , but attractive alſo , and that far more then in inferior men . The boldness therefore aſſumed by me at this time , in tendering to Your View and Judgement this poor Eſſay ( a weak endeavour of Service to our Country ( of which You are ſo true a Lover ) will appear ( I hope ) the more excuſable : For as thoſe Parts which deſerve Admiration in You , cannot but command Offices of Homage and Gratitude from all good men ; ſo thoſe Parts which render You humble , and gentle , and willing to pardon other men's Miſtakes , will induce you to interpret well that Homage and Gratitude . Sir , I have a very low conceit of this Conſtitution , as it is now by me faſhioned ; but I have a ſtrong Imagination , That it might prove Publicly advantageous , if it were by wiſe and conſidering men better formed and completed . I have therefore purpoſely left a large Margin to my ſhort Diſcourſe , that a better pen , and direction might change and ſupply my failing Invention , and take the ſame liberty to expunge the vanities of my tedious expreſſions . If there be any thing here tha may but adminiſter the leaſt Occaſion or hint to your Worth to be a more beneficial Patriot , I ſhall think it a happy Service ; if not , yet let not my fruitless wiſhes want your excuſe ; and you ſhall oblige me to be Sir , Yours moſt humbly devoted in all Service and Obſervance to my utmoſt power , H. PARKER .
