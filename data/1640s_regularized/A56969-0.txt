TO My much honoured , and no less truly beloved Friend , EDW . BENLOWES , Esquire . My dear Friend , YOu have put the Theorboe into my hand , and I have played : You gave the Musician the first encouragement ; the Music returns to you for Patronage . Had it been a light Air , no doubt but it had taken the most ; and among them the worst : But being a grave Strain , my hope's are , that it will please the best ; and among them , You. Toyish Airs please trivial ears : They kiss the fancy , and betray it : They cry , Hail , first ; and after , Crucify : Let Dorrs delight to immerd themselves in dungwhilest Eagles scorn so poor a Game as Flies . Sir , you have Art and Candour : Let the one judge , let the other excuse Your most affectionate Friend , FRA . QUARLES
