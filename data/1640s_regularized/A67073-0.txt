TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND NOBLE Lords FRANCIS Earl of BEDFORD , Robert Earl of Warwick , William Viscount Say and Seal , Edward Viscount Mandevilc , Robert Lord Brook , John Lord Roberts , and the rest of the Honourable Lords Committees in the upper now • e of the high Court of Parliament , Grace and Peace with multiplicity of all Blessings temporal and eternal . Most Noble LORDS , THat which the learned Doctors of the Jews do 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 say of their Masorah , to wit , That it is and hedge or defence to the Law . We Christians may more truly say of our weekly Sabbath , the Lords day , that it is the hedge of defence to true Christian Religion . Masoreth sepes legi . For as their Masorah ( which was their Annotations upon all the Scriptures of the old Testament , showing the genuine reading and signification of every word in the Hebrew text , with what pricks , vowels and accents it ought to be , and was anciently written and read by Moses and the Prophets , and by tradition from Ezra , and other succeeding Father's in all ages delivered over unto them ) did serve as and hedge and fence to keep the Scriptures of the old Testament pure from all corruption and alteration , so that if any Scribe did in writing any copy of them , omit or add one word or letter ; or altar and change any vowel , point or accent , his error might easily by the notes and rules of their Masorah be discerned and amended : So the Lords holy weekly Sabbath being rightly observed according to the Law of God , and the first institution and sanctification of it , that is , First , by cessation and rest from all worldly cares , and all secular affairs ( in respect whereof it is called in Scripture , 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 Sabbath , that is , rest and cessation . ) Secondly , by devoting it only to the worship and service of God , and by sanctifying it with preaching , reading and hearing of the word , prayer , meditation , and other works of piety and exercises of true Religion ( in which respect it is called the Lords day , that is , the day of the Lord Christ , consecrated to his honour , and to the service and wor • hip of God in his name ) It is most certainly ( as we find by experience ) a strong hedge and fence to true Christian Religion , by which true piety , and the true knowledge and worship of God , and true Faith in Christ , are upheld , maintained , increased and continued among all Christian nations from generation to generation . Without observation of this weekly Sabbath , and keeping this day of the Lord Christ holy , by holy assemblies , the public and private worship of God , the knowledge of Christ , the memory of our Redemption by him , and of his finishing and perfecting that great work , and resting from it in his resurrection , the public preaching , reading and hearing of the word , and all other exercises of Christian religion , which are the most effectual ordinary means of grace and furtherances to eternal life and blessedness would undoubtedly grow out of use , and at length utterly decay and vanish . This consideration did move me to insist more largely upon this subject , and to make many Sermons upon that Text , Gen. 2. 2 , 3. which briefly relates the first institution of the Sabbath on the seventh day in the first week of the world ; and Gods blessing and sanctifying of every seventh day in every week to be and holy Sabbath to his people . Out of which Sermons first publicly preached to mine own peculiar flock , I did afterwards compose this Treatise at the importunity of some of my best affected hearers , and imparted several written copies of it unto diverse of them , having at that time no hope to get it licensed for the Press . For by Gods special providence I having handled the doctrine of the Creation , out of the 1. Chap. of Genesis , was by my order of preaching and expounding of that Scripture , led along and brought to this Text , concerning Gods sanctifying of the seventh day , at that very time when a book of liberty for sports on the Lords day , was by the Bishops in every Diocese sent to every Parish Church , and commanded to be publicly read by every Minister in time of divine Service in the audience of all the people : And because I proceeded to handle this subject , as the order of my text did led me ; and durst not balk that part of Gods word ; I was three several times convented before my Ordinary , and admonished under pain of suspension , to proceed no further in this doctrine , not for any error which could be objected against any part or passage in it ; but only because the times would not bear it ; And because I did not hold it fit nor safe for me to obey man rather then God by concealing from my flock any part of Gods truth , and shunning to declare unto them the whole counsel of God ; I have undergone the high displeasure of that Primate to whose jurisdiction my Church does belong , who upon diverse false informations of catchers , which have been employed to entrap me in my words that they might have something whereof to accuse me , hath caused me to be convented before the Kings Majesty , and the Lords of his Honourable Privy Counsel , and hath charged and accused me to be a Preacher of factious and seditious Doctrine , and for many years the great troubler of the City of London : Whereupon I was committed close prisoner for two and twenty weeks , and through close custody was by sickness brought near unto death , and could not obtain so much liberty as to be confined to the limits of my brother's house for the safety of my life , upon bail of a 1000 pound given , until by the testimony of fifty five Neighbour Ministers of best report in and about the City , I was declared to be innocent and free from all the crimes of which I was accused . Now blessed be God for your happy Assembly in this most hopeful Parliament , by which I have been eased of my strait bonds , and the times are so changed , that this Treatise , and diverse others of my labours are licensed to pass by the Press into the public view of the world . I should not have dared to commend it to the sighed , and grave Judgement of your Honours ; If your godly Zeal for the sanctifying of the Lords day , and for the honouring of the name of the Sabbath ( which appeared most evidently to us all , who of late were present at the time when that scandalous libel , entitled , Sunday no Sabbath , was most accurately and judiciously sifted and examined by your Honours , and justly censured and condemned to the fire ) had not encouraged me to this bold attempt . Although I have in this Treatise propounded and assayed to prove out of the Text and other places of holy Scripture such a ground of the weekly Sabbath , as the learned in their writings have not heretofore observed : Yet because the end , use and scope of this discovery is most pious and godly , and it tends altogether to heap more honour on Christ , to advance Redemption above Creation ; grace above nature , the state of Regeneration above the state of Innocency ; and to show a necessity of the change of the Sabbath from the seventh and last , to the first day of the week , after Christs performing and finishing of that great work of our Redemption in his resurrection ; for which he was promised on the seventh day next after the ending of the Creation : I hope it will give no offence , nor receive censure of novelty ; but rather find grace and acceptation in the eyes of your noble persons . That great God ( who hath ( as I believe and here profess ) magnified his holy weekly Sabbath by grounding it in the first institution on Christ promised ; and hath made it more honourable by removing and carrying it along together with Christ the Redeemer from the day of the promise to the day of the full performance of the great work of Redemption ) magnify your Honours , and make your persons still more and more honourable , by noble Acts undertaken and performed for the honour of his holy name , the advancement of true Religion ; and the peace and prosperity of this Church and Kingdom under our most gracious Sovereign Lord and King . To whom next under God and the Lord Jesus Christ , I most humbly devote my self , and vow to remain ever a most loyal subject ; and next under him to your Honours A most dutiful servant and daily suppliant to God for your everlasting blessedness , GEO . WALKER .
