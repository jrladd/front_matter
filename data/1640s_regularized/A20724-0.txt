TO THE RIGHT Honourable , my very good Lord and Patron , Edward Lord Newburgh , Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster , one of his Majesties most Honourable Privy Counsel . And to his Religious and Virtuous Lady , all Peace and Happiness . Right Honourable : PArdon ( I beseech You ) my boldness , in presuming to present your Lordship with such a mite , as not being a brag of my ability , but a Testimony of my loyalty and gratefulness to your Honour , to whom I owe my self . And if your Lordship shall pleased to accept these first Fruits of my labours in this kind , as a testimony , how much I deservedly honour You ; let the World Paraphrase upon me what it will : for where I owe a just Service , I had rather undergo the Censure of vainglory , by being too forward in hasting to the Press ; than unthankfulness to Your Honour , to whom I am so deeply obliged by Your noble Favours . My Lord , this is a Sermon Preached at my departure from the Parish of St. Stephens Wall-brook , where I lived and laboured in another men field , for the Inning of his Harvest , till it pleased your Lordship out of your most undeserved Grace and Favour , to Present me to a Living of greater valve , and more certainty , in respect of my own Propriety and independent Interest ; whither now ( by Gods assistance ) I am hasting : Only I make bold , before I go , humbly to entreat your Lordship's Patronage of this weak Work ; hoping that the Time will come , when I may present unto your Lordship's view , some Thing of greater weight and worth . In the mean while , humbly desiring pardon for this my bold intrusion on your Honour , I commend your Lordship with your virtuous Consort to the Lord of Lords , wishing you the Glory of both Ages : which shall the daily Prayer , of Your most Humble Servant and most Thankful Beneficiary George Downame .
