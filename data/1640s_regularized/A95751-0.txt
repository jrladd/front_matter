TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , And moſt noble LADY , My deer and loving Mother , the Lady DOWAGER of Cromartie . MADAM , FILIAL duty being the more binding in me , that I do owe it to the beſt of Mother's ; if in the diſcharge thereof I obſerve not the usual manner of other sons , I am the less to blame , that their obligation is not ſo great as mine : Therefore in that do preſume to imprint your Ladyships name in the Frontiſpiece of this Book , and proffer unto you a Dedication of that , which is beyond the capacity of other Ladies ; my boldness therein is the more excuſable , that in your perſon the moſt virtuous Woman in the world is entreated to Patronise that , which by the learnedeſt men may happily be peruſed . I am confident ( Madam ) that your gracious acceptance of this Preſent is the more eaſily obtainable , in that it is a grandchild of your own , whom I thus make tender of , to be ſheltered under the favour of your protection ; and that unto your Ladyship it will not be the more unwelcome , for proceeding from the brains of him , whoſe body is not more yours by generation , then by a moſt equitable purchaſe are the faculties of his mind ; the dominion which over my better half you , by your goodness , have acquired , being , in regard of my obedience , no less voluntary , then that of the other is for procreation natural . Thus ( Madam ) unto you do I totally belong , but ſo , as that thoſe exterior parts of mine , which by birth are from your Ladyship derived , cannot be more fortunate in this their ſubjection ( notwithſtanding the egregious advantages of blood , and conſanguinity thereby to them accrueing ) then my self am happy ( as from my heart I do acknowledge it ) in the juſt right , your Ladyship hath to the eternal poſſeſsion of the never-dying powers of my soul . For , though ( Sovereignty excepted ) there be none in this Iſland more honourably deſcended then is your Ladyship , nor whoſe progenitors , theſe many ages passed , have been ( on either ſide ) of a more Noble extraction : Yet , laying apart Nobility , beauty , wealth , parentage , and friends , which ( together with many other gifts of fortune ) have hitherto ſerved to adorn your Ladyship beyond others of your ſex , who for all theſe have been deſervedly renowned ; and ( in ſome meaſure ) not eſteeming that properly to be yours , the receiving whereof did not altogether depend upon your own election : it is the treaſure of thoſe excellent graces , wherewith inwardly you are enriched , that , in praiſing of your Ladyship is moſt to be pitched upon , and for the which you are moſt highly to be commended ; ſeeing by the means of them , you , from your tendereſt years upward , until this time , in the ſtate of both Ʋirginity and Matrimony , have ſo conſtantly , and indefatigably proceeded in the courſe of virtue , with ſuch alacrity fixed your gallant thoughts on the sweetness thereof , and thereunto ſo firmly and cheerfully devoted all your words and actions , as if righteousness in your Ladyship had been and inbred quality , and that in your Will there had been no aptitude of declining from the way of reaſon . This much is ſufficiently well known to thoſe , that have at any time enjoyed the honour of your Ladyships converſation , by whoſe moſt unpartial reports , the Splendour of your reputation is both in this , and foreign Nations accounted precious , in the minds even of thoſe , that have never ſeen you . But in ſo much more eſpecially , do the moſt judicious of either ſex admire the rare and ſublime endowments , wherewith your Ladyship is qualified , that ( as a pattern of perfection , worthy to be univerſally followed ) other Ladies ( of what dignity ſoever ) are truly by them eſteemed of the choiſer merit , the nearer they draw to the Paragon propoſed , and reſemble your Ladyship ; for that , by virtue of your beloved ſociety , your neighbouring Counteſſes , and other greater Dams of your kindred and acquaintance , become the more illuſtrious in your imitation ; amid whom , as Cynthia amongſt the obſcurer Planets , your Ladyship ſhines , and darteth the Angelick rays of your matchless example on the ſpirits of thoſe , who by their good Genius have been brought into your favourable preſence to be enlightened by them . Now ( Madam ) leſt , by inſiſting any longer upon this strain , I ſhould seem to offend that modeſty , and humility , which ( without derogating from your heroic virtues ) are ſeated in a conſiderable place of your soul , I will here , in all ſubmiſsion , moſt humbly take my leave of your Ladyship , and beſeech Almighty God , that it may pleaſe his Divine Majeſty ſo to bless your Ladyship with continuance of days , that the sons of thoſe whom I have not as yet begotten , may attain to the happiness of preſenting unto your Ladyship a brain-babe of more sufficiency and conſequence ; and that your Ladyship may live with as much health , and proſperity , to accept thereof , and cheriſh it then , as ( I hope ) you do now , at your vouchſafing to receive this , which ( though diſproportionable , both to your Ladyships high deſerts , and to that fervency of willingness in me , ſometime to make offer of what is of better worth , and more suitable to the grandeur of your acceptance ) in all ſincerity of heart ( confiding in that candour and ingenuity , whereby your Ladyship is accuſtomed to valve gifts , according to the intention of the giver ) and in all duty , and lowliness of mind , together with my self in whole , and all my beſt endeavours , I tender unto your Ladyship , as becometh , ( Madam ) Your Ladyships moſt affectionate Son and humble ſervant , THOMAS URQUHART .
