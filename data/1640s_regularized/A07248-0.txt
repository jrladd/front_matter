To my much Honoured Friend , ANTHONY SENTLIGER , Of Oukham in Kent , Esquire . Sir , THat the Pa • ronage of trifles , in this kind , hath long since rendered Dedications , and Inscriptions obsolete , and out of fashion , I perfectly understand , and cannot but ingenuously confess , that I walking in the same path , may be truly argued by you of weakness , or wilful error : but the reasons and defences , for the tender of my service this way to you , are so just , that I cannot ( in my thankfulness for so many favours received ) but be ambitious to publish them . Your noble Father , Sir Warham Sentliger ( whose remarkable virtues must be ever remembered ) being , while he lived , a master , for his pleasure , in Poetry , feared not to hold converse with diverse , whose necessitous fortune's made it their profession , among which , by the clemency of his judgement , I was not in the la • tO place admitted . You ( the Heir of his honour and • esta • e inherited his good inclinations to men of my poor quality , of which I cannot give any ampler testimony than •• y ••• •• ee and glad profession of it to the world . Beside , ( and 〈 ◊ 〉 not the least encouragement to me ) many of eminence and the best of such , who disdained not to take notice of me , have not thought themselves disparaged , I dare not say honoured , to be celebrated the Patrons of my humble studies . In the first file of which , I am confident , you shall have no cause to blush , to find your Name written . I present you with this old Tragedy , without Prolog •• , or Epilogue , it being composed in a time ( and that too , peradventure , as knowing as this ) when such by ornaments , were not advanced above the fabricque of the whole work . Accept it I beseech you , as it is , and counterfeit • tinue you favour to the Author . Your 〈 ◊ 〉 PHILIP MASSINGER .
