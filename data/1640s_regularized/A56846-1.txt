To the Readers . NOw the business is ended . If you look upon this skirmish with a general eye , you will see nothing but ( as in a Battle ) smoke and confusion : But if you mark every ones particular behaviour , you will easily distinguish betwixt a rash fiery spirit , and a truly valiant . In the Doctor , you shall find a David , fighting Gods defensive Battles , without sinister respects , or private passion : In Cal. you shall see the son of Nimshi , matching furiously , and hewing down the Priests of Baal , yet nevertheless a great worshipper of Calves : In the Replier , you may behold Ionathan coming a Reserve to David , though perchance shooting his arrows sometime wide , and sometime open : It lies in you , Readers , now , to judge , and give the Palm : For the Doctors part and mine ( would Cal. durst make the third ) we both resign our shares : Let Truth be crowned with the Victory , and the God of Truth , with Glory . FINIS .
