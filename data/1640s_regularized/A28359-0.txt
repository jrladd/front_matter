To his ever Honoured Uncle , HENRY SHELLY Eſquire , one of the Members of the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS in PARLIAMENT Aſſembled . SIr , 'twas not the hope of adding either to your honour , or my own profit , ( but my certain knowledge of the encouragement which any pious endeavours ſhall receive from your religious self ) that made me not hazard , but preſume on your acceptance : were my Poſition contrary to what it is , I might then be sensible of a fear , and ſuſpect its welcome ; becauſe I am confident that nearness of relation cannot bribe your judgement , no not to purchaſe but a ſlight view from your obſerving eye . But being as it is , no way contradictory to what I affirmed before : I hope it will not breed in you the leaſt suspicion of a change in my affections : Sir my hope of your acceptance , is not grounded upon the agitation of ſo poor a principle , as that of Kindred , for I am ſure that your judicious and always juſt cenſure , will not be pleaſed with that from me , which from another would prove distasteful ; therefore ( for my part ) I ſhall not be refractory , but ſubmit to your profound judgement , and whither you approve or diſprove , I ſhall ſtill remain what I ever was , Your faithful Servant and Nephew , PETER BLAND .
