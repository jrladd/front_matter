TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Sr. JOHN WOLLASTON , Knight and Alderman of the Honourable City of London . Right worshipful , Such are my known engagements to your self , and your worthy and virtuous Lady , that all men may justly expect ( if God put any thing into my hands ) I should not defraud you of the honour and acknowledgements which I owe to you both , but rejoice to express my gratitude to God almighty , in raising up to me such special and precious friends , to so great advantage and increase of my long-despaired health , as hath made me of late to omit complaints , and many to wonder at the change . Beside , Sir , your own cost and kindness hath been , by Gods blessing , the only Sunshine to ripen these my labours , & produce them to the public , and that ( breaking thorough so may difficulties ) I should be able to bring them to this perfection , that at least they are useful while the old ones are in use , for 35. whole ones of these and many parts and pieces of the rest ( which call Collects ) are ( verse for verse ) of the same • quantity with the old , and may be sung in public , while some ( wedded to custom ) sing the old without any incongruity at all : so that n • ne can possibly point out any considerable psalm , or par • of a psalm , that is well done of the old , but her • it is to be found , and the absurdities removed neither is any thing left out , which is not so poor and imperfect , or far off the words and sense , a • that it is requisite to be made wholly new , or i • not already taken into the new . Wherefore I humbly present it as a token of my thankfulness , praising the Lord for you , and praying the Lord to enrich you , and my much Honoured Lady with abundance of heavenly forwardness , faithfulness , and fruitfulness , which may be summed up to the glory of God , and furtherance of our account in the day of Iesus Christ our Lord , Your worships fervent and faithful Minister , to his utmost , WILLIAM BARTON .
