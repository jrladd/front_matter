To the most Honoured Virtuous Lady , Mrs. DOROTHY STANLEY . MADAM , NOne can wonder that I bring these EMBLEMS under your Protection . For I and this Book have acquired so near a Relation , that I must ( for my own sake , ) do it what good I can : And the best way I know to advance it's condition , is to prefix your Name . Had they been high Discourses of the best Philosophy ( whither Ancient or Modern , ) or choice pieces of Philology , I should have offered them to your noble Husband Mr. THOMAS STANLEY , whom our Island stands admiring to see him now ( as once the great Alexander ) conquer the world , when it's scarce thirty years since first he came into it ; There being no glory that Greece or Rome , or their Successors can boast , which his matchless Genius hath not made his own , and ours too , by a noble communication . Therefore to him also I inscribe these EMBLEMS . I am bold thus to present them , that as Chapels ( which before were but Lime and Stone ) they may grow venerable by their Dedication : and Likewise be and Emblem of the humble respect and services of MADAM Your most obedient Servant R. D.
