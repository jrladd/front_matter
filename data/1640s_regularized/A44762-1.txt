To my Imperial Chamber , The City of London . Renowned City , IF any showers of adversity fallen on me , some of the drops thereof must needs dash on thy Streets . It is not a shower but a furious Storm that powers upon me now , accompanied with fearful cracks of thunder and unusual fulgurations . The fatal Cloud wherein this storm lay long engendering , though , when it began to condense first , it appeared but as big as a hand , yet by degrees it hath spread to such a vast expansion , that it hath diffused it self through all my Regions , and obscured that fair face of Heaven , which was used to shine upon me ; If it last long , it's impossible but we both should perish . Peace may , but War must destroy . I see poverty posting apace , and ready to knock at thy gates ; That ghastly herbenger of Death the Pestilence appears already within and without thy Walls ; And me thinks I spy meager-faced Famine a far off making towards thee ; nor can all thy elaborate circumvallations , and trenches , or any art of Enginry , keep him out of thy Line of Communication if this hold . Therefore my dear Daughter , think , O think upon some timely prevention , it's the Counsel , and request of Thy most afflicted Mother ENGLAND .
