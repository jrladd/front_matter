TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , the Lords and COMMONS assembled in the High Court of Parliament . RIGHT Honourable Lords , and worthy Gentlemen , We are all imbarqu • worser in the ship , the Commonwealth ; and as in a ship there are diverse Agents , whereof some of the chiefest , at the stern to gove • ne ; others of • n inferior rank climb the Mast hoist sails , and doe inferior works in it , all of them according to their several rank , as they do the duties of their several places ; so have interest in the Common good , and either do , or ought to mind the public welfare of it : And as in building of the Tabernacle , some of the chief sort brought gold , silver and precious stones , others of inferior sort , goats hair and Badgers skins , every man according to his ability , did contribute unto the same . I , though but of the inferior rank in this ship , even the meanest of all others , yet embarked therein , see not but I ought to endeavour , though but in inferior works the good of it , who though I have not gold , silver , or precious stones , nor any thing beside my poor prayers to advance the glorious Tabernacle , yet would with Ahimaaz , run also , as one willing and desirous to do good , if I had any ability in my self , or opportunity : But having nothing of my own , finding this little Manuscript among the papers of my deer deceased brother , and considering the troublesomeness of the times the fears of the better sort , and hope's of the worse : I have adventured to make it public , which though written some time since , and upon another occasion , yet there may something be gathered out of it ( if I mistake not my self ) which may be of good use for these present times of our fears , and sad apprehensions , wherein if there be any thing which in your grave wisdoms , you may think fit to put in execution , it shall much rejoice me , that I brought it to the light , or at least , if it may but occasion your wisdoms to take into your serious consideration , the subject matter of it , which is the securing of the Kingdom against all dangers , that may come to it , and in your wisdoms to think upon better directions , that may remove the fears and apprehensions of most men in these tumultuous times , by reason of the Insurrection of our neighbouring Kingdom , and the just fears we have of these pestilent enemies of our Church and Common wealth , The Papists in this Kingdom , and their Aoherents , the Prelates : Now as concerning my brother's manuscript , as it was penned in time of a grea • S. a preparation made by the French King some ten years past , so as I had it from his own mouth ) it gained the approbation and good liking of his Majesty , who commanded him to write his judgement and opinion of those preparations , and by what means ( if they were intended against us we might secure our selves , both for the present , and in fu • ure ; which though for some reasons was not thought fit to be put in execution , yet I have been encouraged by some of good judgement , now to publish it in these times , wherein we have some more apprehension of danger then formerly partly by the actual rising of these many ill affected to Religion in Ireland , and also those proud threatening speeches lately given forth by the Papists here at home , which if not by some such course , as is here pr • pounded , be prevented , may breed more danger then most are sensible of . Eliah's cloud rose but like a hand , which after overspread the whole heaven , what this may do , if suffered to enlarge it self ; how far reach , we cannot directly say ; but even to our own Horison we may w • ll presume , if not repelled , or dispersed by a strong and swift gale ▪ The mischief they carry with them cannot be contained in the neighbour Kingdom , if they thus grow in their progress . What combination there may be with foreign states I leave to deeper judgements , but for my own part , I shall ever subscribe unto the opinion of that noble Lord , concerning and old Enemy the Spaniard ▪ that if he ever find and opportunity , and advantage against us , he will not balk it : I cannot easily be drawn to a belief , that that great Fleet they sent two years since upon our Coast , when we and our true hearted brothers , the Scots , were ready to enter into a bloody battle , was to guard only his Soldiers , or treasure ; but that there was a design in it upon this Kingdom , though by Gods mercy prevented . Never came such a Fleet upon our Coast , save in 88. when they intended a real invasion . But if it be objected ; was he not in league with us ? But alas , what security can we have thereby , in being in league with him , or any of that Religion : when first they hold that it is no fault to break faith with Heretics . Secondly , If it be ? The Popes dispensation will take it away . Thirdly , if the Pope find it for his advantage he will so charge them to break with us , that so conscience and obedience shall cure their malice and perfideousnesse : I am bold to add to what my brother wrote , what once , long since I read in a little Treatise , which may something conduce to this , of that brave Lord , the late Earl of Essex ; expressed in and Apology in the late Queen's time of happy memory ▪ which may something strengthen my brother's opinion for making Sea preparations ; which with my Brother's , I humbly offer to your considerations , there being none under Heaven to whom we can address our selves , for power and fitness to correct the malignant aspect of these influences , beside your honours : And now most noble , and grave Senators , the true and ever renowned Patriots of your Country , if my Zeal for my countries freedom and prosperity , have born me beyond my bounds , impute it to my error of judgement , and let your candor close with the good intentions of him , who is more in wishes , and hearty desires , then in parts and abil • ties , for the felicity of his Country . And he shall ever remain , Your Honours most humble , and obsequious servant . GEO . HARVVOOD .
