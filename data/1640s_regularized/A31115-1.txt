TO THE HONOURABLE THE KNIGHTS , CITIZENS , AND Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT . Moſt Renowned Worthies , THis Antiteichiſma ſtands under high Protection fortified . Oppoſition it had , and ſhall have ſtill . But your honour advanceth Truth , and nothing more . Nothing hath been more obſcured is seen , and how . Age does not , cannot wrinkle her . Where the clouds of Sophiſtry be diſpelled , her Face ſhines with beauty . To begin this belief , J publiſhed this . The common charms of ſuperſtition take not me . Whereat J aim , the mark is hit . J beſeech you embolden me , and I can speak plain . Whilst the cloſe followers of Truth and Peace are purſued , the two ſacred Siſters be forced by Humoriſts . And ſo impetuouſly , as if their being preſent were the preſent being of incendiaries . A ſtrange Paradiastole : obſerve it , I have done . Be You ever under the divine influence , and J the humbleſt of your Servants , THOUGH . BARTON .
