To the Right Honourable the Lord Scudamore , Ʋiſcount Sligo . My Lord , WHen the orb of learning is illustrate by the irradiation , and benign aſpect of Princes favours , then all things in a Kingdom are conſpicuous and beautiful ; but when the great Luminaries and Patrons of knowledge are eclipſed , the orb muſt needs be obſcured , and every thing within its circumference darkened ; hence ( as in the darkness of the air ) men are troubled with ſtrange and miſhapen apparitions , which they verily believe are real viſions , whereas indeed they are but phantoms and imaginations of our brains , which upon the introduction of a candle are eaſily disſipated ; even ſo in the intellectual darkness , men are troubled with uncouth and hideous opinions , believing and embracing them as real truths , whereas indeed they are but illuſions . Morte obita quales fama eſt volitare figuras , Aut quae ſopitas deludunt ſomnia ſenſus . Which upon the approach of the light of Scripture and Truth , do vaniſh into nothing . In this time when darkness hath overwhelmed the minds of many men , who are moleſted with ſtrange fancies , which they call new lights , whereas indeed they are but the glating of rotten wood , or of glowworms , or thoſe skipping lights ( which we call jack in the candle ) I have adventured to bring in this little tract , as a piece of wax candle , after ſo many bright torches , that men may be undeceived , and that the true abjects both of faith and practice may be manifeſted ; to which ſmall piece J have prefixed your Lordship's name , as being bound in the obligation of duty and affection to Your goodness and eminent parts in general ; whoſe knowledge , judgement , conſcience , and ſincerity are ſuch , and ſo well known , both at home and abroad , as they need not the help of any pen ; ſo likewiſe , J am tied by this ſmall mite to express my gratitude , in particular for your Lordship's favourable aſpect on , & reſpect to me ; which I cannot better testify , then by acknowledging my self . Your Lordship's humble Servant to command ALEXANDER ROSS .
