TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT DEVOREUX Earl of Essex , Lord Chamberlain of his Majesties Household . My Lord , BE pleased to accept this grain of Incense , offered up to your name , on the Altar of a real heart , and if I have erred in my devotion , style it the since of and hallowed ignorance , rather than the crime of any wild presumption ; deign to confer upon me the Epithet of Superstitious rather than the attribute of profane , since the latter issues from a defect of Worship , and the former results from and excess of adoration . My Lord , your name is followed with such a train of acclamations , that I should have appeared dull even to stupidity , if I had not been wakened with their alarm , to the expression of my zeal , which I have endeavoured to improve by powering it forth into this Congratulation , and if it be too inconsiderable to entitle it self to so great a Patron , set upon it the noble character of your mercy , and let it derive that from your charity , which it could not hope to find from my self , the remission of many errors : The lowest hearts are the fittest sacrifice for the highest . Altars . Therefore , though this Poem cannot lay claim to your Lordship's praise , suffer it to pretend to your Lordship's pity : though I have no sublimity of Fancy to marshal me among the chiefest of Poets , yet I have humility , which shall rank me among The humblest of your Lordship's adorers , THOMAS PHILIPOT .
