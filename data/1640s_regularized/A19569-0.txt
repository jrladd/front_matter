TO MY DEER MOTHER THE MUCH HONOURED , HOLY , AND BLESSED CHVRCH of ENGLAND . DEare and bleſſed Mother ) thou haſt been long peſtered with undutiful , yea unnatural ſons . Sometime they have been ſuperſtitious , sometime profane , and for ſome years , ſome that have profeſſed themſelves beſt to God , have been undutiful to thee . It is and ill sign , if children acknowledge a father , and deny a mother , that all hath not been well Dost thou live in perpetual adulteries and rebellions that thy children renounce thee ? Surely thy love is to thy husband alone . Though when thy husband knows of it , and he does not miſlike it , nay , gives thee general allowance , thou takeſt ſome ornaments and Jewels from bleſſed and good men ▪ yet is thy heart to Chriſt continually , yea and all thy carriages are according to his will . Many of thy worthy sons have vindicated this truth both againſt Rhemes , and Amſterdame . They could not endure that their mother ſhould be called whore , much less proved ſo . Amongſt the reſt , I thy unworthy son have appeared in thy cauſe , renouncing all the blood in my heart that riſeth againſt Chriſt , and thee his ſpouſe . If I appear of too mild a temper , thou haſt not begotten me of murdering mettle , but of that word which makes us turn spears , and ſwords into mattocks and scythes . How ſoever I look , I am ſure I am thy child . And if I have done thee any honour in this poor ſervice , I am glad : if not , yet I have done the beſt that I thought fit for theſe oppoſers ; and ſo with my humble prayers for the flouriſhing , and increaſe of thy peace and truth , I kiss thy hand , and reſt Thy obedient son to his utmoſt power , ROBERT ABBOT .
