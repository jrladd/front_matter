To my beloved friends , whoſe ſouls hunger after ſincere Milk . Dear friends : IT hath been the universal condition of the Earth ( Mankind ) to be overſpread with a black Cloud of darkness ; and the knowledge of the King of righteousness hath been manifeſted but in ſome few ſcattered ones , which as they have had the ſpring in themſelves , ſo they have been as lights in the dark world , and others have walked in their light , and reſted content to drink of their ſtreams , as if their declaration of truth had been the very Fountain it ſelf . I my ſelf have known nothing but what I received by tradition from the mouths and pen of others : I worſhipped a God , but I neither knew who he was , nor where he was , ſo that I lived in the dark , being blinded by the imagination of my fleſh , and by the imagination of ſuch as ſtand up to teach the people to know the Lord , and yet have no knowledge of the Lord themſelves , but as they have received by hearſay , from their books , and other men's words . I ſpoke of the name of God , and Lord , and Chriſt , but I knew not this Lord , God , and Chriſt ; I prayed to a God , but I knew not where he was , nor what he was , and ſo walking by imagination , I worſhipped that devil , and called him God ; by reaſon whereof my comforts were often ſhaken to pieces , and at laſt it was showed to me , That while I built upon any words or writings of other men , or while I looked after a God without me , I did but built upon the ſand , and as yet I knew not the Rock . And now know friends , That this ignorant , unſettled condition is yours at this time , though I know , that the proud King fleſh that is in you , will be ready to ſpeak within you , and tell you , that you do know God , and Chriſt , and be offended with me , becauſe I ſay you know him not . I do not write any thing , as to be a teacher of you , for I know you have a teacher within your ſelves ( which is the Spirit ) and when your •• eſh is made ſubject to him , he will teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , ſo that you ſhall not need to run after men for inſtruction , for your eyes being opened ; you ſhall ſee the King of righteousness fit upon the throne within your ſelves , judging and condemning the unrighteousness of the fleſh , filling your face with ſhame , and your ſoul with horror , though no man ſee , or be acquainted with your actions , or thoughts but your ſelves , and juſtifying your righteous thoughts and actions , and led you into all ways of truth . And this is the Spirit , or Father , which as he made the Globe , and every creature , ſo he dwells in every creature , but supremely in Man ; and he it is by whom every one lives , and moves , and hath his being ; perfect man is the eye and face , that ſees and declares the Father , and he is perfect when he is taken up into this ſpirit , and lives in the light of reaſon ; and there is no man or woman can ſay that the Father does not dwell in him , for he is every where ; there is no a creature in the compass of the creation , but he is in that creature , but diſobedient man knows him not , and why ? Becauſe fleſh is not ſubject to the ſpirit within it ; his covetous fleſh hath deceived him , for he either looks abroad for a God , and ſo does imagine and fancy a God to be in ſome particular place of glory , beyond the skies , or ſome where he knows not , or in ſome place of glory that cannot be known till the body be laid in the duſt . Or elſe if men do look for a God within them , according as the Record ſpeaks , God is within you ; yet they are led by the motions and commands of King fleſh within them , and not by King ſpirit ; and here they are at a loss , not being able to diſtinguiſh between fleſh and ſpirit , by reaſon that covetousness and ſelf-will blinds their eyes . Truly friends , King fleſh is very covetous , ſelf-loving , and ſelf-honouring ; it likes them that ſay as it says , but it would impriſon , kill , and hang every one that differs from him ; he is full of heartburning , either of open envy , and bitter diſtemper , or elſe carries himſelf in a ſmooth , quiet way of hypocrisy , walking in a show of truth , like and Angel of light , but when he gets and opportune power , he turns to be a tyrant , againſt the way of the ſpirit . And ſo all his love was but for by-ends , to satisfy ſelf in ſome particular or other : But now the King of righteousness within you , is a meek , patient , and quiet ſpirit , and full of love and ſincerity , he burns up the proud and haſty fleſh , he loves truth , and hates a lie ; if the creature acts unrighteouſly , he checks and ſhames him , if he act righteouſly ( according to the creation of a man ) he ſpeaks peace within , and ſo makes the man to walk ſincerely , and warily . And when you come to know , feel , and ſee that the ſpirit of righteouſneſs governs your fleſh , then you begin to know your God , to fear your God , to love your God , and to walk humbly before your God , and ſo to rejoice in him ; and therefore if you would have the peace of God ( as you call it ) you muſt know what God it is you ſerve , which is not a God without you , viſible among bodies , but the ſpirit within you , inviſible in every body to the eye of fleſh , yet discernible to the eye of the ſpirit ; and when ſouls are made to have community with that ſpirit , then they have peace , and not till then . For this let me tell you , that if you ſubject your fleſh to this mighty governor , the ſpirit of righteouſneſs within your ſelves , he will bring you into community with the whole Globe , ſo that in time you ſhall come to know as you are known , and you ſhall not need to run after others , to learn of them what God is , for as you are a perfect creation , every one of himſelf ; ſo you ſhall ſee , and feel that this ſpirit is the great governor in you , in righteouſneſs ; and when you come thus to know the truth , the truth ſhall make you free from the bondage of covetous , and proud fleſh , the Serpent that held you under ſlavery all your life time . Well , as darkneſs hath overſpread the Earth ( Mankind ) ſo now is the time come , that knowledge ſhall abound , and cover the earth ( Mankind ) light begins to ariſe , the spirit begins to appear in fleſh , he spreads himſelf in his ſons and daughters , ſo that as the Sun ſhines from Eaſt to Weſt , ſo ſhall the appearing of this Son of righteouſneſs he ; he comes not now in corners , but openly ; the poor receive the Gospel , ( which is this everlaſting spirit ) wiſe men in the fleſh are made fools , fools are made wiſe , ſcholars are declared to be ignorant , the ignorant ones in men's learning , become abundantly learned in the experimental knowledge of Chriſt . I do not write to teach , I only declare what I know , you may teach me , for you have the fountain of life in you as well as I , and therefore he is called the Lord , becauſe he rules not in one , but in everyone through the globe , and ſo we being many , are knit together into one body , & are to be made all of one heart , and one mind , by that one spirit that enlightens every man . I have yielded to let theſe few experiences come abroad , and partly unwilling , becauſe I ſee more clearly into theſe ſecrets then before I writ them , which teaches me to rejoice in ſilence , to ſee the Father ſo abundantly at work ; and it ſhall ceaſe speedily for men to ſtand up as they do to teach one another , for every one ſhall be taught of him , and I ſhall be as ready to hear as to ſpeak , and to give as to receive , and every one delighting to do as they would be done unto . This is the King of righteouſneſs that ſhall reign in the earth , this is the ſpirit that is now pouring out upon ſons and daughters ; though it yet ſeem ſmall , it ſhall ſpeedily increaſe , and the Father will not deſpiſe that day of ſmall things ; proud fleſh ſhall die , and reign King and governor in man no longer : they that have underſtanding know what I ſay , others may reproach , and be offended , but after they have been tried in the fire , which is the spirit , they will acknowledge a truth herein , and he made to speak as a friend to truth . Your friend , whoſe peace , liberty , and life lies in the ſpirit that governs within the Globe . Jerrard Winſtanley .
