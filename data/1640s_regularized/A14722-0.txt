TO HIS ROYAL MAIESTIE KING CHARLES . Most dread Sovereign , I Having had many thoughts of the vicissitude of times , and of the mutation and change of this precious Jewel Peace ; And likewise observing how Sampsons Foxes have swinged about their firy tails of dis • ention and discord , whereby this grim Monster ( War ) hath violently broken down the Pale of prosperity in our Neighbouring Kingdoms ; and would subtly be picking of the golden Lock of Tranquillity , the which Omnipotency ( by your Royal Majesties goodness and well-governing ) hath been so tender in preserving . And in regard neither Peace nor War can bud nor flourish , but under the well-managed Sword : according to my slender ability I have spent some few Months in discoursing upon the principal parts of the Body of War , and that in two respects : First , that some one judicious , learned , and well-experienced Soldier , taking a survey of my defects might be thereby instigated to begin and finish a more excellent work tending to this Subject . And secondly , that my fellow Subjects who have not been versed in these affairs , might gain some profit , whereby they might be enabled to do your Majesty the better service upon all sudden occasions , when your Highness shall call them thereto . And although it may be demanded whither Reading or Practice have the first place in this Art , to be laid as a foundation to this Building ; I must with Marius answer this question , who envying at the Nobility of Rome ( says ) Qui postquam Consuls facti sunt , acta Majorum & Graecorum Militaria praecepta legere coeperunt . Homines praeposteri , nam legere quam fieri ; tempore posterius , re & usu priùs est . For since that all motion and actium proceedeth from the Soul , and cannot well be produced , until the Idea thereof be first imprinted in the mind ; according to which pattern the outward Being and sensible resemblance is duly fashioned , how is it possible that any actium belonging to War , can be well expressed , when the mind is not directed by knowledge to dispose it in that sort as shall best agree with the occurrents of such nature's as are necessarily interested both in the means , and in the end thereof ? Therefore Speculative knowledge , as the Gnomon or Tramontane to direct the course of all practice , is first to be respected ; But withal no man can so well rest upon such certainty through the Theoric of Knowledge , as he that hath also proved his learning verified by practice ; And in regard the habitude of Arts and Sciences cannot be said to be perfectly attained , unless their particular parts are in such sort apprehended , that from the variety of that individuality ; the Intellectual power frameth general Notions and Maxims of Rule uniting terms of the same nature in one head , and distinguishing diversities by differences of properties , aptly dividing the whole body into his greatest and smallest branches , and fitting each part with his descriptions , duties , cautions , and exceptions ; For unless the understanding of a Soldier be in some kind qualified , and able by Logical discourse , to ascend by way of composition , from singularity to Catholic conceptions , and return again the same way , to the lowest order of his partitions , the mind cannot be said to have the perfection of that Art , or instructed in true knowledge , but guided by some broken Precepts ; whereby it will follow that this Science of War being divided into many branches , and consisting in the multiplicity of diverse members being all so material , and interes • ed in the Bulk , that a maim of the smallest part , causeth either debility , or deformity in the body , so that every small and unrespected Circumstance , quite altereth the nature of the actium , and breeds such worser • sparity , and difference , that the resemblance of their equal participating properties is blemished with their disagreeing parts . It cannot be denied , but he that is acquainted with most occurrences , and best knows the variety of chances in the course of War , must needs be thought a more perfect Soldier , and deserveth a Title of greater dignity in the noble profession of Arms , then those that content themselves with a few common Precepts and bro • en Rules ; Therefore experience and practice does not only make a Soldier worthy of his name ; But the knowledge of the manifold acc • dents which rise from the variety of humane actions , wherein Reason and Error hath interchanged contrary events of Fortune : And this knowledge is only to be gained in the Registers of Antiquity and History recording the passages of former a • es , that their harms may be our warnings , and their happy proceedings our fortunate directions ; Wherefore accordingly ( Most gracious Sovereign ) I have endeavoured to set for a Preface to this Warlike-Discourse , such accidents and occurrences as happened in the raising and declining of the foure most Ancient and renowned Monarch • es ; a subject full of the variety of the events of Fortune . And then I have briefly run over the principal parts of the Body of War ; A Subject ( if not spoiled by my illiteratnesse and inability ) fit to kiss your Royal hands ; And like Pyrrbus in Plutarch in silence craves your Highness tuition ; I do not question your high esteem , and gracious acceptance of works of this nature ; and although these my collective Anima'd versions are but shadows to the real substance your Princely mind is beautified withal , yet may they seem worthy to excite your Warlike cogitations to visit the excellent treasure of your own mind , that thence you may extract particulars for this warlike age , agreeable to your Magnanimity and wise • ome , the Ambassage of this my pains is delivered and discharged . And seeing the Lord of Hosts hath fitted and enriched your Royal person with the best abilities of nature , and your Heroic spirit with true wisdom and undaunted valour ; So that in your youth , your height of courage did venture to plough thorough the rude Seas , and pace over the Territories of Foreign Kingdoms to the world's amazement , ( a fortunate pres • ge that your mighty hand should afterwards Conqu • r , and subjugate both by Sea and Land ; ) Accordingly Implore the Heavens to be propitious to your Majesty , and • own you with Victory over all your Enemies ; Thus most humbly craving pardon for my great presumption , desiring God to be your Rule and Guide , I shall be • old to conclude with your Royal Motto , Exurgat Deu • & dissipentur Aenimici ; Your most faithful and loyal Subject and Servant R.
