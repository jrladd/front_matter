TO THE Right Honourable THE LORD PHILLIP HARBERT . My Lord , ALthough I have not exactly obeyed your commands , yet , I hope , I have exceeded them , by presenting to your Honour , this Treatise , which is , so much the better , by being none of mine own , and may therefore peradventure , deserve to live , for facilitating the Issues of Death . It was writ • … long since , by my Father , and by him , forbid both the Press , and the Fire ; neither had I subjected it now , to the public view , but that , I could find no certain way to defend it from the one , but by committing it to the other ; For , since the beginning of this War , my Study having been often searched , all my Books ( and almost my brains , by their continual alarms ) sequestered , for the use of the Committee ; two dangers appeared more eminently to hover over this , being then a Manuscript ; a danger of being utterly lost , and a danger of being utterly found ; and fathered , by some of those wild Atheists , who , as if they came into the World by conquest , own all other men's Wits , and are resolved to be learned , in despite of their Stars , that would fairly have inclined them , to a more modest , and honest course of life . Your Lordship's Protection will defend this Innocent from these-two Monsters , Men that cannot write , and Men that cannot read , and , I am very confi dent , all those that can , will think it may deserve this favour from your Lordship ; For , although this Book appear under the notion of a Paradox , yet , I desire your Lordship , to look upon this Doctrine , as a firm and established truth , Dam vida osar morir . Your Lordship's most humble Servant Io : DONNE . From my house in Cov • … nt-Garden . 2 • … .
