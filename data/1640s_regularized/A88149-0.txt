TO THE HONOURABLE Houſe of COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT . VEſtrum eſt imperare , noſtrum obſequi : Your Commands wrapped up in your Deſires I have deſired to obey , both to the Pulpit and the Press . Not that I can tender any thing either to your ears or eyes , which may be worth your acceptance , but that I cannot but moſt readily tender obedience when you command , and labour to ſerve you , when you call for my ſervice . The ſubject of that hours Diſcourſe that I had then before you , and of this Book , which is the ſame , was very well worthy your eyes and ears , if the managing of it had but fallen into a skilful hand ; [ For what more needful duty to be urged or to be practiſed , then Heart-communication . ] But according to my poverty I was then ready to offer , and you were pleaſed to accept ; and I hope for the like acceptance now . I humbly recommended the words then ſpoken to your hearts , and ſo I do now the ſame written : and as I deſire to preſent them now written to your hands , ſo do I my self , and all I am or can at your feet ; as Your poor humble devoted Servant , J.
