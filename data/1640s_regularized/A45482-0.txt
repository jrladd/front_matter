To the Honourable JOHN BOND , Governor , and Captain General of MADAGASCAR . GReat Actions are not enterprised by vulgar Spirits : without eminent Virtue , man seldom riseth above private Interests : in this design , you have given the World a Testimony of what Latitude your thoughts are , how not to be circumscribed within the common narrow Limits . The Roman , in that glorious Age ( which remains and Envy to all succeeding ) employed their most famed Generals ; in discovery of remotest Islands , and our own had the Honour to be invaded by the greatest Caesar : and when he made his attempt here , the Indies can afford no people more divided in it self then we were ; more weak in fortresses on land or ships at Sea : but time hath reformed us to the Excellency we now so much glory in . The Nobleness of his Example serves you for encouragement ; and I am certain , the largeness and fertility of the Island of Madagascar , promises you a far more rich return : And it may be possible something of his Honour . Before you could set sail , you met with a rough storm at Land , and your Fleet was in danger of Wrack , before it launched forth : but the opposition became your advantage , and who laboured the ruin of your expedition , raised it up , and confirmed it on that height , that no Envy now can undermine it , nor can it lie open to any future question . The Parliament after full debate found how Just and Honourable to the Kingdom was his Majesties Favour to you , and by their approbation added a second kind of Seal to your Patent . I here present you with the Island you aim at , drawn in a little Tablet , the Cloth course , and the colours poor , and ill laid , but it may challenge the better reception , in regard it was taken to the life by me and eye witness , in whom the memory of that fruitful and pleasant Country so far prevails , that it makes me ambitious to forsake my Native , and wait upon you thither : if you will please to admit me Sir , most devoted to your self and the Service WALTER HAMOND .
