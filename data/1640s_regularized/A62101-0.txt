TO The Honourable Sir MICHAEL VVOOD-HOUSE Governor of Ludlow , and Colonel to the Lifeguard of the Prince of WALES . Noble Sir , MY dependence on you , and your respects to me , did formerly move to some public manifestation of my service to you , and had not the Press , like the pool of Bethesda , been oppressed with multitudes , the world ere now had taken notice of it ; but this following Sermon had the advantage to step in before that , which had lyen there longer ; and this I dedicate to your Name : as it was with attention and favour herd , by many gallant Gentlemen and Soldiers , so I hope by your self ( who are both ) it will be accepted , as agreeable to godliness , and entertained as a demonstration of the inward affection which is due from Your Servant , E. S.
