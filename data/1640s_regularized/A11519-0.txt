The Hiſtory of the Inquiſition , and particularly oh • the Venetian . With the Motives which cauſed that moſt Renowned Common-Wealth of Venice to make diverse Ordinances touching this matter . To the Moſt Renowned Duke of Venice : F. P. V. S. wishes all happiness . PERFORMING with all due reverence the command laid on me by your Highness to draw unto a head , and ſet down in order all matters which concern the Office of the Inquiſition againſt Heresy : I have found all things ſo well ordered in times passed , by the Counsels of this moſt Renowned Commonwealth , that there needs no other thing to be done , but only to put together that which on diverse occaſions hath been determined , bringing to pass that which was deliberated by the moſt excellent Council of Ten , and in the year 1550. the 22 of November , the 8 Chap. vid . that throughout all the Venetian Dominion ſhould be and uniform proceeding , and conformable to what is obſerved within this renowned City : As alſo it was agreed upon between Pope Julius the third , and this moſt illuſtrious Common-Wealth , in the year 1551. Chap. 18. 19. Which in my respectful opinion may eaſily be done , if the order made upon several occaſions be reduced unto Chapters , and thence as it were a recapitulation framed , wherein ſhall briefly and ſummarily be ſet down ſo much as is neceſſary to be obſerved , and Copies may be given either of the Heads alone , or joined with the aforeſaid determination it ſhall seem beſt . I will firſt gather the Heads , then will I add the conſiderations and cauſes for which theſe Order were firſt eſtabliſhed to the Honour of God ; for the which it is alſo neceſſary to continue the keeping of them , for the maintenance of holy Religion , and public quietness .
