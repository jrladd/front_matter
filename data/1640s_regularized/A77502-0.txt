To all the Lovers of Truth , and Peace , ſpecially thoſe in the Town of Great Yarmouth . TO ſome of you were theſe Meditations lately preached ; For all of you they are now Publiſhed . My Design in both is , ( that which ſhould be the Deſire of every true Iſraelite ) The Healing of the Breaches in this our Iſrael . And my Hope's are that there is not a line within the Circumference of this Tract , which is not drawn directly to this Centre . If any ſhall think otherwiſe , let them miſtruſt their own eyes , which , being dazzled , will make the Sunbeam ( though moſt direct in themſelves ) seem distorted , and crooked . Sure I am , what ever my lines may seem to be , my Intentions have been right . Theſe I can approve to God who knows them , and the other ( I truſt ) ſhall approve themſelves to thoſe who ( being not prejudiced ) are able to judge of them . If herein I fallen ſhort of my Mark , let it be enough I have aimed , and ſhot at it . In magnis voluiſſe — Yours , devoted to the ſervice of Gods Truth , and the Churches Peace , IOH. BRINSLY .
