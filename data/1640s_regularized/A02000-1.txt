To The right illuſtrious Lord , Micer Franciſco Bonnet , Viceroy of Catalunna , and Counselor of Barcelona . RIght reverend Sir , being of opinion , that the ſubject of this book , entitled the Galateo Eſpanol , is of great importance , and of much furtherance , to know how , and in what manner , men ought ( ordinarily ) to carry themſelves , ſo that they be not only not ill thought of , and hated of others , But very acceptable , and pleaſing to all : and conſidering on the other ſide , that for want of Copies thereof , the common wealth loses this ſo great a good . I determined to print it at my own charge . Becauſe that it is not now in my power , or ability , to do things of greater importance , I have ( at leaſt ) done what I could in this little : and as much as my skill would reach unto . Afterwards taking it into my conſideration unto whom I were beſt to dedicate it , as the custom is to do , in the like impreſſions of books ; my fancy then gave me , that I could not better dedicate it , to any body then your honour , who with greater zeal and thought , desires , & procureth , the good of this ſame common wealth then any other , ( as all do well ſee , & confess ) as well in the charge of a Counselor , as in that of a deputy , which your honour holds , at the preſent , and does order , and govern there in with ſo great diligence . Therefore I truſt , that your honour will be pleaſed , to receive it under your protection : and although the ſervice be not ſuch , as is fit for the perſon of your Honour , yet receive the heart and good will , with which it is offered , together with the deſire I have , to ſerve your Honour , and the common wealth , ( daily ) more and more , in matters of greater conſequence : for by this favour , and reward , I recover more heart , and vigour , to undertake , and finiſh a greater work . God keep your Lordſhip . Right illuſtrious Sir , Bernat Cuſana kiſſes your Honours hands .
