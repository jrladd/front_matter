TO HIS MUCH HONOURED FATHER IN LAW Mr. WILLIAM PUREFEY OF CALDEcoate in Warwickshire , Esquire . SIR . THe times favouring truth it becomes every one , now that God hath given opportunity , to bring out of his store both new and old as he is provided . This which I here present to you and the World is both , for it deals with our primitive English Antisabbatarians , Breerewood and Broad , but chiefly with the latter , because none else ( that I know of ) have undertaken him being not in print , and therefore known , but to a few as also with the whole cluster of our modern Writers upon that subject , which are too many to name except with and etc. For the plot of the times would • s been against the power of Godliness , which could never been pulled down whilst the Sabbath stood upright , and therefore our Patrons of impiety have rightly projected to take that out of the way which stood so much in theirs , and to remove that same holy interruption which God in his care and wisdom had put to our days and ways of Worldly nature's , that so they might bring all to a level , by paring away Sabbath • and Sermons , which was the only way to mount them to the height of their design of bringing Godliness to a form , and all things ( but Episcopacy ) from ius Divinum to i • s Humanum , that they may be all in all ; but all this while they have kicked against the pricks for which they now smart , nor could they expect other then that they which opposed the rest of God should have their own rest molested , for God will find a time to bring truth to light , though she wade through a long Eclipse , and to shut up error in darkness , and her abetters in disgrace as now they are , for with the froward he hath threatened to show himself froward , and he hath made it good , to the praise of the glory of his power . Your ever obliged Son in Law GEORGE ABBOT .
