To the Reader . BOokes are the pictures of men's lives delineated , first by fancy , and by judgement drawn to the life . Such is this piece , the living Idea of him that writ it , who though now dead , has a living Monument to his worth . His Book , which despite of fire , can never con â€¢ ert to ashes , It's Lentum Ilium , slow Troy ; that will not be easily consinned ; he shall live in Paper , which shall make him live in's Marble . And in this good Reader , his worth shall be Emergent , he has dONE many things well , and nothing ill . Therefore receive him as and absolute testimony of wit and fancy , or else deceive thy self , since his works are as excellent , as singular . HEN . GLAPTHORNE :
