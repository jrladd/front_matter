TO THE HIGH , AND MIGHTY , AND OUR ROYAL KING CHARLES ; By the Grace of God King of England , Scotland , France , and Ireland , etc. The Lord grant , to his Honours increase , to his days length , and to his Royal Person and posterity ( both hear and hereafter ) Eternal Glory . Amen . Most Royal Sovereign , I Do not presume to soar so high ; in Respect of the worth of my labours above others ; for had they been penned by a far more exquisite Author , yet might a much inferior patronage ( notwithstanding ) have been a worthy favour : I am I do confess altogether unworthy under such a patronage to purchase favour to a popular eye : how then shall I crave favour of your Sacred Majesty to deem a gracious eye upon me . To prostrate these before your Highness , as a present , they proceed from too inferior and Author ; Or as counsels , it were too great presumption . Yet your gracious , meek , and pious Sovereignty emboldeneth me to devote the fruit of my mean labours to your Princely eyes , because ( though weak , yet ) faithful , which though it cannot be good enough to deserve that gracious countenance of my Royal Sovereign , yet this I can protest , that my heart , my tongue , my hand and pen , shall be always , upon all opportunities ( next under God ) devoted to my Royal King , and Gracious Sovereign . And be glad as I am able ( though unworthy ) to extol Your Highness worthy praise . H. Walker .
