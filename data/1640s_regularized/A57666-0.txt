To the Right honourable GEORGE Lord BERKLEY , Baron of Berkley , etc. My Lord , THey who have been long at sea , when they come on shore , think that the Earth moves as the Sea did , till their brains be settled ; even so these men who have been lately traveling in the new found world of the Moon , which swiftly moves about the Earth , think when they come down hither , that it is the Earth which moves : This false imagination I have endeavoured to remove in this Book , which now comes abroad under your Lordship's Name ; the reason of my dedication is , because I understand by your Lordship , that the Gentleman , who came down a while ago from the Moon , with news of a late discovery there , is of this opinion ; and one who hath relation to your Lordship , which indeed I knew not till now , that the Book is almost printed : my other reason is , for that I am bound in a dutiful recognition of your Lordship's respects to scholars in general , and to me in particular ; which shows that not only are you noble by extraction , but by your affection also and disposition to learning , which is now so much slighted , yea vilified , by such as are either ignorant , or wicked ; the one slight learning , because they know it not , — ignoti nulla cupido ; and like the Fox in the Fable , disparage the grapes , because he could not reach them ; the other rail against learning , as the mad African's do against the Sun ; and how can Owls and Bats love the light , which manifest their deformity ? Can thieves and cutthroats , while they are penetrating the works of darkness , abide the light of a torch ? The infernal ghosts tremble to see any light , — trepdiant immisso lumine manes : But your Lordship , being de meliore luto , — knows the worth of learning , and therefore loves it ; which that you may long know , love , and live , shall be the wish of Your Honours most humble servant to command , ALEXANDER ROSS .
