TO THE SERENISSIMO FERDINAND the second , great Duke of Thuscany , my most gracious Lord . SEeing to nothing I am more bound , then to serve your Highness , I cannot consequently have any greater desire then to be accounted your servant : that as the benefits which our House continually receives , are publicly known ; so the marks of my devotion may publicly appear ; which after dedicating my self to your Highness , I cannot better manifest , then by offering these Discourses ; which are so far unequal to your greatness , and to what I owe you , that it may well appear to be rather done for confession of my debt , then for satisfaction of that obligation , which as it can only receive abatement from your commands , so commands coming from so great a Prince , will have force again to make it the greater . Vouchsafe then to honour me with commanding me , thereby to make me the more obliged : and be pleased to accept these weak labours , with looking upon the valve which your Heroical Name gives them . And upon the weight which my devotion puts upon them , with which I wish to your Highness all those felicities ; which as you give manifest proofs to merit , so by the divine goodness you shall happily obtain : And so I present you the most humble Reverence , Of Your Highness most devoted servant , VIRGILIO MALVEZZI .
