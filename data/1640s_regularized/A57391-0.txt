TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS IN THE High Court of PARLAMENT now assembled . PArdon me Right Honourable , if among your other more serious present affairs , I presume to dedicate to your acceptance and perusal this short discourse of foreign Traffic : It hath ever been accounted a branch of Englands Royal Stem , and a commodity , that for many years , hath brought a wonderful Revenue to Englands Diadem ; It now presseth to your presence as and aggrieved weight , laden with many setters , imposed thereon by the covetousness of some , and by the Enviers of our prosperous Traffic , yet seeing that like religious Pilots you guide the helm of our Kingdom with your hand , while your eyes are fixed on heaven , taking from thence the conduct of your earthly directions , it hope's by that your good and gracious aspect to be now freed from them all , and flourish again in its fi • st lustre . It is now about forty years since it began to be ingrafted in our English Climate , and ever since found our soil proper for i • s further grouth , but if it find not your Honours favourable protection and future cherishing , a few years more may see it withr • worser and reduced to its first nothing , I dare not undertake in this discourse to demonstrate the burdens that cloggeth it in this Kingdom , the several Societies of incorporated Merchant's of the City of London being called before you , will best particularise • he same , only I have laboured to show , what may best gain it in those parts of this Kingdom where it is wanting , and augment that portion thereof in those places where it is settled already . Let not then , Right Honourable , so excellent a Jem , and so hitherto profitable and eminent a revenue , for want of a little of your help , die in your days , nor yet perish in our age , but release it from those subtle Gives , that cunningly have been intruded upon its liberties , and goes about to kill the root thereof , decking it once again as primarily , with some of those lasting & beautiful immunities that can and may make it live longer , and spread it self much fairer , that the times to come may deservedly attribute to your names and memory that splendour & glory it shall obtain by your benignity , so shall the King , our gracious Soveraig • e , have just cause to commend your care for your preserving to Himself and Kingdom , this so noble a Royalty , your Honours be justly applauded for employing your industrious hands and heads in pruning , and lopping the disordered branches of so excellent a grafted , and the Merchant's of this Kingdom that have hitherto sown in Expectation , live in hope to reap a fruitful crop of their foreign adventures , and heartily pray for the good success of all your other weighty affairs , and among the rest , so shall ever ascend the devout Orisons of Your Humble Servant L. R. Merchant of London .
