TO The Reverend Mr. John Arrowſmith Maſter of St. Iohns College in Cambridge . BUt that ( Worthy Sir ) you know as well how to pardon as judge , I might juſtly ſuſpect your entertainment of theſe pieces . Faint breathings of a mind burdened with other Literary employments , neither brought forth with Care , nor ripened with Age , yet ſuch as if they be not now blaſted may be the firſt Fruits of a larger Harveſt ; Let them Sir , Receive the honour and ſhelter of your Name , ſince born under your Government , and cherished by your Candor ; That if they chance to ſurvive their Father , they may teſtify he was Sir Your moſt humble Servant , J. HALL .
