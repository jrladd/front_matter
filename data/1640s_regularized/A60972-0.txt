To the Honourable , The Knights and Burgesses for the County of Yorkshire , in the Commons House of Parliament , viz. The Lord General Fairfax , Sir William Strickland , Sir Philip Stapleton , Sir Henry Cholmley , Sir William Alison , Mr. Henry Darly , M. Hoyle , M. Alured , M. Pelham , etc. I Should exceed and Epistle , to speak of you in your several spheres of activity , for the advancement of the cause of God ; Some of ye have jeoparded your lives in the high places of the Field ; Some of ye offered your selves , willingly among the people . When the great work of God is finished , the names of those shall be sought for that have acted for him , and it shall be said , What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordeca • for this ? You that work both for God & your Country , shall be recorded both in the Chronicle of Heaven & Earth : And you are the more eminent in this , that you have sat out the Aposta • ies , and unfortunate failings of so many ( preserved through the power of Christ ) They went out from you , because they were not of ye : And such is the quality of your employment , that you may learn to be at once both Saints , and Statesmen , in this work : for the daily opening of the secrets of affairs before you , both religious and civil , may make your house a Senate and a Temple ; and the more spiritually you work in State-affairs , you act in a higher capacity then common Statesmen , or former Parliaments . My prayer is for you , That you may be steadfast and unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , knowing that your labour shall not be in vain in the Lord . So prays your Servant , John Saltmarsh ,
