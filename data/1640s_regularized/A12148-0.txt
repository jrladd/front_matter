TO MY TRULY NOBLE , And my ever honoured Friend , Captain Richard Owen . SIR , THis Poem , at my return with you , from another Kingdom ( wherein I enjoyed , as your employments would permit , the happiness of your knowledge , and conversation ) emergent from the Press , and prepared to seek entertainment abroad , I took boldness thus far to direct to your name and acceptance ; promised by my confidence in your love to Poesy , wherein your clear judgement and excellent abilities would at first have made me less adventurous . Be pleased till time mature a worthy satisfaction to your favours , to smile upon this tender of my gratitude , and while your services call you hence to enlarge your honour , by making your faith and valour more exemplary against a rebellious enemy , let me preserve a peace at home , in the contemplation of your friendship , and be happy to profess my self Your humble Servant and Honoror , IA . SHIRLEY .
