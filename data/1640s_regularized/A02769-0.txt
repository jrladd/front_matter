The Dedication . LOrd , my first fruits should have been sent to thee , For thou the tree That bore them , only lentest unto me . But while I had the use , the fruit was mine , Not so divine As that I dare presume to call it thine . Before 'twas ripe , it fell unto the ground : And since I found It bruised in the dirt , nor clean nor found ; Some I have wiped and picked , and bring thee now , Lord , thou knowest how : Gladly I would , but dare it not avow . Such as it is , it's here . Pardon the best , Accept the rest : Thy pardon and acceptance makes blessed .
