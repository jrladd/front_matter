To his honoured friend Master SAMUEL HARTLIB . SIR , I Have had many flying thoughts , concerning the Advancement of Real Learning in general , but particularly of the Education of Youth , Mathematics , Mechanics , Physic , and concerning the History of Art and Nature , with some more serious ones concerning your own most excellent advices for and Office of Public address . And indeed they were but flying thoughts , for seeing what vast sums were requisite to carry on those designs , and how unwilling or unable men generally were to contribute towards them , I thought it but labour lost to fix my mind much upon them . But it having pleased God unexpectedly , to make me the Inventor of the Art of Double Writing , daily and hourly useful to all sorts of Persons in all places of the world , and that to perpetuity , I conceived that if there were understanding enough in Men to be sensible of their own good , and Thankfulness or honesty enough to reward the Contrivers of it , such Means might be raised out of this Art as might at least set the aforementioned Designs on float , and make them ready to set sail towards the haven of perfection upon every opportunity of stronger gales . And thereupon I reassumed my Meditations , which I here give you , desiring you and your Ingenious Friends to remeditate upon them and correct them , but withal to think of the best Course , how to improve my Invention to such advantage , as may if possible , make us capable of enjoying more then bore Ideas of that Happiness , which the achievements of our designs promises . I shall desire you to show them unto no more then needs you must , since they can please only those few , that are Real Friends to the Design of Realities , not those who are tickled only with Rhetorical Prefaces , Transitions , & Epilogues , & charmed with fine Allusions and Metaphors , ( all which I do not condemn ) wherewith , as I had no abilities to adorn my discourse , so I wanted all other requisites thereunto , Having written it ( as Your self must bear me witness ) at your own Importunity in the midst of my cares and endeavours , to perfect mine Invention , and which is work in the midst of my hard and perhaps unprofitable labour , to prevent the ingratitude and backwardness of men to reward him , who shall earnestly labour to express himself , London the 8. Ianuary . 1647 / 8 Yours and your designs most affectionate servant , W. P.
