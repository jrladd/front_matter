TO The Honourable and truly Pious , WILLIAM LENTHALL Esquire â–ª Speaker of the Honourable House of Commons , in Parliament assembled . Renowned Patriot ; WHen I consider those admired gifts wherewith your honour is so excellently qualified : I censure it too much abruptness to present such worth with so mean a talent ; yet having had the happiness to be and eyewitness of your love and countenance to Religion and piety : And knowing how ignorant many are , not only of God , but themselves too ; who may be bettered ( if God please to give a blessing to this my labour ) by the use hereof ; I humbly crave leave to beg this favour to patronise my poor endeavours , published for the meditation of those who know better , and instruction of those that know less : That all who use it , may savingly know God , and themselves ; which for you and all Gods people , is the prayers of Your humble Servant , Henry VValker .
