TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE IOHN , LORD ROBERTS , Baron of Truro : AND TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY LVCE his pious Consort , Grace and Peace from Jesus Christ . Right Honourable and truly Noble : IT was not so much the Nobility of your blood , as that of Grace given unto you from the divine hand , which did so much interest you in the love and esteem of that worthy Servant of Christ , and Author of this work ; in whom â–ª Urim and Thummim met , whose whole course being a real , and vital sermon , sweetly consonant to the tenor of his teaching , made him amiable living , and honourable dead in the opinion of as many as well knew him : This was the thing ( I suppose ) which wrought unto him from you ( as well as from many others of your Noble Stock and Rank ) more then and ordinary esteem : and this is that which makes me in nothing to doubt , but that his labours made public under your names , shall be very welcome unto you : the work is answering unto the man ; and therefore worthy you , and your acceptance : only this is the disadvantage ; that though these Sermons had his own tongue to preach them ; yet they want his own pen to commend them unto your Honours : I well know that the expressions of holy truths from a gracious heart by lively voice do breed deeper impressions in thirsting and reverend hearers , then any publishing of them in dead letters can do ; yet this we find in experience , that holy and necessary truths , this way coming abroad into the Churches of God , do get the advantage to continue longer , and to become a more general good ; they may stir up the affections , and set onwards in the course of holiness where the comforts are sure , and the honours honouring everlasting . In these ensuing Sermons you have variety the mother of delight ; and such notable descriptions of the person , offices , love , and life of Christ , that by them you may not only be settled in divine assurances to your further comforts , but also directed and encouraged ( both in your inward and outward conversation ) to follow the example of Christ , the most blessed and unerring example unto all Christians . This Champion I beseech you both to follow unto your lives end ; make it your work to set up Christ , and his Religion both in your hearts , and in your houses . Acknowledge none but Christ in matter of salvation ; and none to Christ in point of affection : let Christ be Christ with you , and then if Christ ( and if not Christ nothing can ) be worth any thing he will make you worthy indeed , he will prove unto you in life and death a Sun , a shield , even a full and and answerable good : with this Christ I leave you , and with you these ensuing Sermons , to be read and observed for your spiritual furtherance in the enjoyment of eternal life by Iesus Christ , desiring the great God of Heaven and Earth to look upon both you and yours in much grace and mercy ; giving unto you all the comfort and crown of Religion here on earth ; and hereafter in Heaven . I rest , Your honours to be commanded JOHN SEDOVVICK .
