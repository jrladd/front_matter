To the Worshipful Alexander Read , Doctor of Physic and Chirurgery , one of the Society of the College of Physicians for the City of London . SIr , having finished this treatise , I considered what entertainment it might find in the world ; and fearing that it would be envied , for the good that it offereth unto this Kingdom , as I the Author have been for my practice , I bethought my self that it might safely hover under your wings , whereupon I am bold to thrust it into your protection , that it may the better be defended from the calumnies of these times . The Subject of it is , that which I have practised and proved by Experience , so that if there be occasion , I believe I shall be able to render sufficient reasons to prove it , from the most Authentic rules in Physic . And if there be any errors escaped in it , I shall rather desire that they may be corrected by the discretion of you or any of the College of Physicians , then disputed upon by new beginners in the practice of Physic , who have but small experience . As for those Medicines published at the latter end of this book , I shall not desire your protection for them , because I never made you , nor any man acquainted with them , For I intended that they should be Protectors for themselves : but however I hope that my endeavours in this small treatise will not be unpleasant , but acceptable to you , for the good which I believe it will do in the World ; and so for this time I rest in some measure of assurance of your worships favour . Your Servant , THOUGH : SHERVVOOD .
