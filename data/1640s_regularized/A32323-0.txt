TO THE RIGHT NOBLE , AND TRULY VERTVOVS LADY TEMPERANCE MOſt virtuous Lady , yea , Virtue it self , under whoſe protection to endeavour is moſt ſafe : and therefore that is here my moſt humble suit . I have , as ensues , taken in hand to inſiſt upon , or rather to deal with moſt peremptory , ſtout , and turbulent Passion . My encounter with ſuch , being countenanced by your self , ſhall mind the more happy success . Which favour , deer Lady , ſhall for ever prove my encouragement , and approve your courtesy , under the ſhadow of whoſe wing I ſhall be sheltered as I walk , from all the ſearching heat , of accuſing hatred ; iſſuing forth the infernal furnace of detraction . Thus far preſuming , it is , doubtless , my duty , to vow you my ſervice : in the performance of which , where I ſhall fail in act , I truſt to fulfil it in deſire , and for ever reſt . Your Honours to Command , So long as mine own to obey : Edward Calver .
