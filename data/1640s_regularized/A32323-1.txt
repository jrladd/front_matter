To his Moſt Noble and much Reverenced Friend , and Kinſman , Maſter JOHN STRVT . Sir , I Do ſo far preſume of your favour as to ſhelter theſe ensuing Lines under the ſhadow of your Protection . J , indeed , acknowledge my boldness in thus intruding upon your worth , to defend my weakness . Notwithſtanding , J am herein encouraged in part to preſume of your Pardon . The ſlender ſubject here preſented to your view , conſists of two parts , Paſſion , and Diſcretion : The firſt part , which is Paſſion , that is abſolutely mine own : and inheritance descending from moſt ancient Parentage . The other , which is Diſcretion , is yours by Poſſeſsion ; and due by Deſert : in which J do but bring the ſhadow to your Sighed , of that which you have the ſubſtance in your self . In which respect it is but my duty to entitle you to that which is yours by endue . Jn which kind alſo , not only that which ensues , but that which is precedent may beg your Patronage , as part of your Inheritage . J do confess J have imprinted the name of that noble Lady Temperance in the front of my Endeavours ; but J know you will account it no diſgrace to part with ſo worthy a partner ; whoſe beauty's , J am confident , doe ( if poſsibly they may do ) As much delight your heart , as the alone Lady of your affections , does your bosom : which can no way be imputed to wantonness , but to wisdom . For what can be of more validity to preſerve the nuptial knot inviolate , then the ſacred tie of virtuous Temperance ? But , not any way to direct , but only to delight you , J have thus far encroached upon your leave . And in Fine , humbly petitioning for your favour , J reſt Yours at Command , as bound . Edward Calver .
