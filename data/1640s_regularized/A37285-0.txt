To the worthy Gentleman Mr. George Butler profeſſor of the Arts Liberal , And true Patron to Neglected Poesy , All Health and Happiness . Worthy Sir , I May be thought bold , if not impudent , ( upon ſo little acquaintance ) to make this saucy trespass upon your patience ; But fame , whoſe office , ( like the Nomenclators at Room ) is to to take notice and proclaim the Name and virtues of every Noble Perſonage , has given you out for ſo Ingenuous a profeſſor of the Arts , & ſo bountiful a patron of poor scholars it has emboldened me , to preſent my Hive of Bees to your favourable protection ; and when I remember how Lewis the eleventh ( of that Name ) King of France took notice , & bountifully rewarded a decayed Gardener , who presented him with a bunch of Carrets , I doubt not of their kind and generous entertainment ; upon which aſſurance I reſt ever . Yours in all ſervice devote . JOHN DAY .
