TO His most Royal ( and I trust in God ( yet ) Most Gracious Sovereign Lord King CHARLES of England , etc. and to the Right Honourable the Peers , Lords and Commons Assembled in the High and Honourable Court of Parliament . MOst Gracious , Sacred and dread Sovereign , and most Honourable pious Pears and Commons in Parliament Assembled : The despicable condition of my poor Estate ( ruined through envy , malice , and revenge abroad in India , and cruelly oppressed by deep ingratitude , partiality and injustice at home in England ; ) the weakness and infermity of my decrepit person ( debillitated by along continued sickness now almost six years complete ) with my simple Ignorant and weak understanding ( yet true loyal hearty affection to my King and Countries glory and renown ) right Humbly , and in all Lowly and Reverend Submission to Your Highness , and Honours Virtues and Authority , craves pardon and remission for my boldness , in interrupting your most serious and most weighty affairs of State , with the dull apprehension of my zeal and affection to Gods glory , the Honour of my gracious Sovereign and his most Royal Posterity , and the welfaire and accommodation of my endeared native Country , which hath induced or rather impulsed , and coacted me to come to counsel before I am called , and to lend the opinion of and unintelligent and unfortunate Merchant , concerning the aptness , accommodation , and assured great benefit of this Kingdom of England by settling a considerable Plantation in the most famous Island of the world ( Madagascar or Saint Lawrence ) and that thereby the glory of Almighty , your Majesties Honour , and the Commonwealths happiness may redound to all the world , as well out of Asia as Affryca ( or rather more and better ) in hopeful or assured expectation ) as out of America and other parts of the world . May it therefore please your Highness and Honours , to pardon my servient zeal and affection to this worthy design ; which if the Laws of England did forbid or give causion to the projectors of new business to the Commonwealth , under pain of loss of life if their projects proved hurtful to the same ( as that ( as I take it ) of the Laced√¶monians or some otherwell governed Commonwealth ( and such law perhaps not hurtful to this Kingdom ) yet would I adventure without any hope or expectation , to my self of reward or accommodation to ) exhibit this project ( so apparently beneficial to the commonwealth in my own strong confident opinion ) if so be it should please , his Royal Majesty and the Honourable High Court of Parliament , to undertake it as abusinesse of State and of great consequence to this Kingdoms its welfare and Indemnity . To insist upon a large Epistle were obnoxious to Your Majesty , and Honours weighty and importent affairs , and my dull apprehension , with the tymorousnesse of my deep offence in such bold presumption , forbids me to take that unpleasing task upon me , I verily acknowledge it a transcendent , haughty presumption in me to exhibit so rude and unpollisht a Pamphlet to Your Highness and Honours perusal ( yea to the meanest of the Honourable House of Commons ) which though it cannot expect gracious acceptance from any , yet if it incur not unto me thereby Your Majesties and Honours just indignation , for my impulsed zeal to my King and Countries good out of the small experience and weak iniuditious apprehension of my unfortunate travels , until such time as more judicious and better intelligent persons by their more skilful prevalent persuasive pens give better encouragement , for speedy and effectual means to proceed in so weighty ( yea most hopeful successful ) a business , I shall have some cause ( yet ) to rejoice in the depth of my misery and affliction ; in the mean time my daily earnest Prayers to God , shall be for his abundant blessings , spiritual and temporal to his Sacred Majesty , and his most Royal Posterity , the Right Honourable High Court of Parliament , and all His Majesties true Loyal Subject's ; and that the Lord Jesus would please to break in pieces the most hurtful Cords of Contention with the spirit of truth and concord , and put away from all them that prosesse his name the offence of quarrels and dissension among them , that we may be joined together in one mind , in truth love and Christian Charity , to the praise honour and glory of God Almighty ; and such shall be ever the prayers , Of Your Sacred Majesties , and Your Honours most Loyal Subject and Servant .
