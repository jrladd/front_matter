TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , THE Lady Rebeccah Wollaſton , Lady Majoreſſe of the moſt famous and renowned City of London , and to the Right Worshipful the Lady Anne Sprignall , Two moſt eminent Patroneſſes and Patterns of Virtue and Piety : J : Ʋ . ever prayeth all increase of Grace here , and fullness of Glory hereafter . Right Honourable and Right Worshipful : THe many deep ties and faſt-binding Ligaments of obliged Gratitude , which have long time tied me in all ſincere obſervances to both your good Ladyſhips ; doe extraordinarily induce , nay enforce me to moſt ſerious study and reſolution to lay happy hold on all opportunities ( though but in any ſmall meaſure , rather than to incur the leaſt ſuſpect of black Ingratitude , hateful to God and men ) to manifeſt the integrity of my moſt grateful Heart , in any , in all my ſincere Services and beſt abilities . And having now compoſed and compiled this little Treatiſe , entitled , Babylons Beauty , or The Romish-catholics Sweetheart ; Even a brief Deſcription of that impudent and audacious Whore of Room , the Great Diana of theſe back ſliding days . Me thought I could not poſſibly pitch upon more fit Patrons thereof , than your good Ladyships , my ever worthily moſt honoured good Friends , whom I know by moſt happy experience to be two moſt eminently gracious and grave Matrons in this our Iſrael ; two moſt fruitful and faithful Professors and practiſers of true Piety and Holiness ; yea , I ſay , two moſt hearty and heroic haters and contemners of this Romiſh-Strumpet , and all her moſt deteſtable Idolatries and abominable ſuperſtitious fooleries and mimical fopperies in Religion , mere baubles of Babel to mock and cheat the children of error & diſobedience . Accept then ( Right Honourable and Right Worshipful ) I humbly pray you , this ſmall Symbol and true Testimony of my moſt grateful heart , and ever , every way , bounden best ſervices ( for many moſt immerited ſweet favours ) truly and duly devoted to both your good Ladyſhips . Which ſingular favour and accuſtomed Chriſtian Candour will ( and that moſt meritoriouſly ) extraordinarily add unto , and mightily augment thee , already , deep endearments of Your good Honours and Worſhips in his Prayers , his Beſt , ever to be commanded , John Vicars .
