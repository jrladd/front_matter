If the public view of the world entertain it with no less welcome , then that private one of the Stage already has given it , I shall be glad the World owes you the Thanks : If it meet with too severe Construction , I hope your Protection . What hazards soever it shall justle with , my desires are it may pleasure your Lordship in the perusal , which is the only ambition he is conscious of , who is My Lord , Your Honour's humbly devoted : Richard Brome .
