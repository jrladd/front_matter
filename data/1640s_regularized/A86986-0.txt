To the Right Honourable Sr. IOHN BANKS Knight , Lord chief Justice of the Court of Common pleasant , and one of his Majeſties moſt honourable Privy Counsel . My Lord , THis Sermon being delivered by a ſon of mine , whom it hath pleaſed God to call to his special ſervice in the Ministry of his Goſpel , upon the anniverſary day of the Inauguration of our gracious Sovereign , the 27 of March last . In the paſsing of it , not only through my ears ( for I may well be deemed partial ) but of diverſe others of the then Auditors ( who ſurely could not be partial ) it found ſuch approbation , as we did not think fit it ſhould be confined within thoſe narrow limits of a ſmall Pariſh but that it ſhould be communicated to others , by this diffuſive way of ſilent ſpeaking by theſe dumb Characters , to the eyes , ears and hearts of all who pleaſe . My Lord , I have long ſtudied to find out ſome way or other , wherely I might return ſome acknowledgement of thoſe many undeſerved favours , which I have received from your Lordſhip , and having the free tender of this Sermon , from the Deliverer of it as a pledge of his duty to me : I could not but think fit ( I having nothing elſe ſo worthy ) to preſent it to your Lordſhip , the rather ; Firſt becauſe the ſubject of it is touching Rulers and Magiſtrates , amongſt which your Lordſhip ſits in none of the loweſt ranks . Secondly , becauſe it teaches the duty of the people to their Rulers and Magiſtrates , and how they ought to deport themſelves towards them in words and actions . A thing very neceſſary in this licentious age of ours where every man conceives he may not only think what he list , but utter what he thinks , be it of the greatest or higheſt : I ſhall humbly deſire your Lordſhip , to ſet apart one vacant hour for the perusal of it , and conſider it comes from a higher Spirit than from the ſpirit of the Speaker ; Wherefore it cannot be altogether unworthy Your Lordship's ſparing ſo much time for contemplation of it : We ſhall wiſh it may prove acceptable to Your Lordſhip ; And for us , both the Author and the Preſenter , we ſhall ever ( as exceedingly obliged ) reſt deſirous to take hold of all occaſions to offer to Your Lordſhip all fit teſtimonies of our duties and reſpects and ſhall ever remain Your Lordship's moſt humble and affectionate ſervants in all we can perform , NATHANIEL HALL , WILLIAM HALL .
