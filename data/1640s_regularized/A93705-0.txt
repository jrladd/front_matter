To the Worthy COVENANTER . I Could have given more , and more easy and common Obſervations ; but theſe times call for Di courſes that work higher , and more quaintly ; I ſay not this to force any reputation upon the notions . This Covenant is the moſt glorious riſe of a Reformation in any age ; mighty and powerful are the Principles of it ; and though this ſeaſon of our Solemnity be cloudy , and our evening bloody , yet it is our Saviours Interpretation ; When it is evening , you ſay it will be fair weather , for the sky is read .
