TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT . My Lords and Gentlemen , I Am not ignorant of the truth and weight of that ſpeech of Pliny , Aliud eſt ſcribere uni , aliud omnibus : the ſame holds of Preaching , it's one thing to Preach a Sermon to a Congregation , another thing to Preach it to all the world in Print ; eſpecially upon ſuch and occaſion as this , and ſuch a ſeaſon as this , when the ſpirit of jealousy and misunderstanding is let lose , and men's hearts as tinder ready to catch and kindle at every spark ; yet ſince you are pleaſed to conceive that this plain Sermon may be useful to others , and thereupon to order my publication of it , I humbly obey your Order , deſiring the Lords bleſsing to accompany it ſo far as to make men wiſely conſider the wonderful works of God , and return to him the glory due unto his name ; The ſame Lord watch over you , sanctify you and guide all your conſultations , that you may be his bleſſed instruments to make this Land a quiet habitation for his people , and a place which himself may delight in : This is the daily prayer Of your humble ſervant in the Lords work S. M.
