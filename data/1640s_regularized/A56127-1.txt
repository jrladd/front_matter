TO THE HIGH AND HONOURABLE COVRT OF PARLIAMENT NOW ASSEMBLED . RIght Honourable Worthies , what the Prince of Latin Poets long since observed in general — Virg. Georg. l. 2. Ali • ur vitium crescitque tegendo ; That maladies are nourished and augmented by concealing them ; is in a more especial manner verified in our Lordly Prelates , ( one of the greatest maladies in our Church and State ) who have been fostered and suffered to grow great among us , only through the conc • alement , palliating , or ignorance of their disloyalties , and other Episcopall vices . The consideration whereof hath induced me to compile and publish , The second Part of this Antipathy ; wherein I have ( according to my weak abilities ) anatomized some of their Traitorous , Seditious , Rebellious Contumacious , Oppressive , extravagant Practises , in ancient and modern times , laying them open unto public view : and withal discovered the frivolousnes of those grounds , the insufficiency of those Reasons alleged for the pretended Divinity , Antiquity , and perpetuating of their Lordly Prelacy among us ; Mat. 15.3 . A Plant ( I dare say ) which our Heavenly Father never planted in our Church ; and therefore certain to be rooted out in his due time ; which in all probability is now near at hand . If these my endeavours ( which I humbly prostrate at your Honours Feet , recommending them to your Noble Patronage , as I did the former part ) may contribute any thing to this much desired , long expected good work , I shall think my labour happily bestowed . In the mean time , I shall be a daily Orator to the Throne of Grace , for a superabundant blessing upon your Honourable Persons and public Consultations , till you have cleansed both our Church and State from all Corruptions which infest them , and Psal • 100.8 . Cut off all wicked doers from the City of our God . Your Honours devoted , and eternally obliged Redeemed one , WILL . PRYNNE .
