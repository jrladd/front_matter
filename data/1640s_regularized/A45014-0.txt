To the Right HONOURABLE The LORDS and COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT , The humble Petition of the Captains , Officers and Soldiers of the Trained Bans and Vounteers , of the County of Buckingham , Aſſembled at Alisbury , Iune 17. 1642. Humbly shows , THat they give you thanks from the depth of their hearts , for the great and many benefits they have already reaped from your no less chargeable , then Indefatigable pains , and in particular for your neceſſary Ordinance of the Militia , on which , as we conceive ( under God ) our ſafety does depend , unto which we moſt cheerfully , ſudmit , as is manifeſt by this days appearance , not only of the Trained Bans , but of well near a thouſand Vounteers , that make all demonſtration of Obedience , as well to this , as all other Commands that ſhall come from your Honourable Houſes , in oppoſition to the Popiſh malignant Party at home , or any other power from abroad , notwithſtanding the many viſible diſcouragements from ill affected perſons that make it their business to blemiſh the validity of your Authority , as alſo by the Lord Lieutenant's abſence contrary to the truſt repoſed in him . Therefore we humbly implore the continuance of your care for our Safeties , and to appoint ſuch a Lord Lieutenant , in whom we may confide , as ſurely you may in us , who are reſolved to lay our lives and fortune's at your feet , in defence of the King and Parliament . And we ſhall pray etc.
