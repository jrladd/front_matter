TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Mr ANTHONY STAPLEY Eſquire , one of the Knights in PARLIAMENT elected for the County of SUSSEX . RIGHT WORSHIPFUL , WHen through ſundry and continued abuſes offered me by thoſe whoſe ſuperſtition I have impugned , I was neceſſitated to commit this Treatiſe to the Press : After ſome deliberation I took boldness to Dedicate the ſame to you , being encouraged hereunto , partly by reaſon of your favourable Affection to my poor Self , which I thankfully acknowledge ; partly alſo and eſpecially becauſe of your known ſincere affection to the Truth , and hatred of all ſuperſtitious Vanities ; and alſo becauſe you are a right Worthy Member of that Honourable Body of the Houſe of Commons , whoſe endeavour is to cleanse the waters of the Sanctuary , from that filth and bitterness , whereby they have been defiled by too many , that they may run pure and clear , to refreſh the Souls of Gods People , I mean to root out thoſe ſuperſtitions and innovations , which have ſo long pestered the Church , and grieved the well-affected : amongſt which this Ceremony is one , which you have not long ſince forbidden by your religious Order , though contrary to the ſame , Pride and ſhame makes the Preachers of to keep it up , and ſuch malignant Principles , by which theſe men have polluted the Peoples judgements , makes them ſtill to practice it . This opinion indeed is very ſpecious , making a show to the ignorant , of great humility , religion , and holiness , when indeed it is a Monſter of many heads ; there being not many Points of Popery , that produce more dangerous Concluſions than it does , ( eſpecially in the ſenſe that ſome hold it . ) The Text which they pretend for this Ceremony being as contrary to it , as light is to darkness . The Lord bless you , and the truly virtuous Lady , the Lady Clerke , your religious Yokefellow , and all yours and hers , with his choiceſt mercies , and pour out his especial bleſſings upon that Honourable Houſe of Parliament , whereof you are a Member , that you may be ſtill tendered of him as the Apple of his eye , and continually preſerved from the Plots and fury of the malignant party , to the glory of God , the safety of Sion , and the perfect Reformation of this Church and Kingdom , which all true Iſraelites deſire , and pray for , that future Generations may praiſe GOD for you , and call you bleſſed . Thus prayeth Your Worſhips in all Chriſtian duties to be commanded , MASCALL GILES .
