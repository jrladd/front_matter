Reverend and Dear Sir , THe right form of Church Government being more ſearched into of late time then formerly , and your ſelf amongſt others having written for the governing power , or juriſdiction of Synods , over particular Churches : We therefore knowing our ſelves bound as well as others , to try all things , and hold faſt that which is good , have conſidered as the Lord hath helped us ; thoſe Arguments of yours which are contained in your Book , againſt the Indepency of Churches ; and not being ſatisfied therewith , your Book being publiſhed in Print ; we have therefore thought meet , in like fort to publiſh our Anſwer , and in that way to show unto your ſelf and others , what yet hinders us , that we do not think your Arguments to be convincing . In which attempt we have been the more encouraged by your profeſſion ( which we dare not but believe ) that in what you have written , you have aimed at verity , and not at victory ; whereof we are the rather persuaded , becauſe we do perceive your whole diſcourſe to be carried along without paſsion and bitterness , in a ſpirit of meekness and love , which alſo we are willing to acknowledge before all men , to your juſt commendation , and the glory of that grace of God that gives you ſuch and heart . And it is our hope , that ſith you profess to aim at the truth , and do diſpute with ſuch a ſpirit , as if you meant ſo indeed ; that therefore it will not be unacceptable to you , if any weakness be diſcovered in thoſe grounds whereon you built this persuasion , that in the preſent Question , the truth does ſtand on your ſide . And as your Book does breathe forth a ſpirit of meekness , ingenuity and love ; ſo we hope you will find , that we have aimed at the like in our Anſwer ; which as we have written and now publiſhed it for the truths ſake ; and for the help of thoſe that cannot attain unto larger , and more learned Treatiſes about this Subject ; So in special manner in love to your ſelf , and our deer Country men & friends , as in other places of Lancaſhire , ſo in your Pariſh of Winwick , wherein one of us was born , and the other was for ſundry Years together and unworthy Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt . Accept therefore we do beſeech you , this brotherly labour of ours , which here we ſend you , divided into theſe few Chapters . We are alſo willing upon this occaſion , to testify our thankfulness for that loving reſpect which we found from you , when we lived together in that Country ; when you were pleaſed to own us in our ſad times . The Father of mercies be with you , and with all thoſe that love the truth in ſincerity ; and bless that Reverend and Grave Aſſembly , whereof we hear your ſelf are a Member , that by their wiſe and holy endeavours , the truth may be cleared , and all corruptions removed in the Doctrine , Worſhip , and Church Government in ENGLAND , to his praiſe and glory ; and the comfort of all thoſe who unfeignedly deſire that the Crown of Chriſt Ieſus , and the Sceptre of the Son of God , may be gloriouſly advanced over all ; which is the prayer of Your Loving Brothers , RICHARD MATHER , and WILLIAM TOMPSON .
