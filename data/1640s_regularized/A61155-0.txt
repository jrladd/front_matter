TO HIS EXCELLENCY , Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX , General of all the Forccs raiſed for the PARLIAMENT . Right Honourable , THe several pieces thus rallied , were never writ in my own power , or appointment , but I had commonly ſome juncture of Providence , and ſomething of a Spirit not my own upon me ; for I obſerved I could not write when I would , my Springs , were not in me , nor could I end when I would , till I had finiſhed this Teſtimony , and for ſomething of God here , I am ſure , there is enough of man , of my self ; Thus is Gods appearing while we are in the Body , he was in Christs which had no ſin , but he is not ſo in ours which are full of ſin . I have ſome few things to ſay , and they ars things of duty from me , and of truth to you ; that God hath filled the ſtory of your life with himself , with his Power , Wisdom , and Love , and all that he may be your fullness , and that you would glory in the Lord : Let me remind you how you have ſeen him from Leedes to Bradfoorth , to Wetherby , to York , to Hull , even from Yorkeſhire to Lincolneſhire , from thence to Naſeby , and ſo through the Conqueſt of Cities , Towns , Caſtles , through ſo much almoſt as a Kingdom comes to . And now after all this enter into your reſt , even the love of God , the Son of God , and there refreſh your self in his light , in his glory , in the bosom of his love , there are pleaſures for evermore ; this is a piece of your courſeſt work , to bear the Sword for him who is the Power of God upon Earth , for the puniſhment of evil doers in the world , the more glorious work is your Spiritual , where Principalities and Rulers , and Spiritual wickedness in high places , fleſh and blood are all againſt you , and yet you above them all , in him , through whom you are more than Conqueror , even him that loved you . Sir , Let it be not your business only to Conquer as a man , but as a Saint , not as a Soldier , but as a Chriſtian , not in the ſpirit of man but of God . Let not a ſin , a luſt , a temptation ſtand more before you in the body , then and enemy in the field : gird on your spiritual Armour , your Shield of faith , your breastplate of righteousness , your Sword of the Spirit , your Helmet of Salvation , and put on your white lining , which is the righteousness of the Saints , and follow him who rides on the white Horſe , in a veſture dipped in the blood of his ſufferings , whoſe name is the Word of God , and tell me if ever there was Glory like unto this Glory . I cannot reckon the mighty men of valour in the world , any thing but a worldly glory , which if it died not with them , or ſome ages after them , yet can live no longer than the life of the world , all theſe things are periſhing ; but to be a man of the holy Spirit , a man born of God , a man that wars not after the fleſh , a man of the Kingdom of God , as well as of England : Thus you ſhall live beyond time , and age , and men , and the world ; gathered up into the life which is Eternal , and was with the Father . Sir , Your dwelling now is much in the ſhadow of death , and amongſt the Graves , and therefore ſo live in Chriſt your life , that you may have one life more then men can kill ; men can only kill the man , not the Christian . Sir , I will not praiſe you , but bless God for you , and his Image in you , this will make great men love God , and not themſelves ; to speak of them as his , not as their own . Now Sir , ſo war , that you may be ſtill a man of peace in the amid of battle , and of compaſſions in the amid of ſufferings , never wearing your Laurel without ſome Olive , that all may know when you act as a Magiſtrate , and as your self , when you act from power , or when from love , from Juſtice , or when from mercy . So love , as you may love God and Christ in men , more then men , and the Spirit in any more then the Form either of Presbytery or Independency . Thus Brothers who can now ſcarcely love one another becauſe of that , ſhall love you , and ſhall learn to love one another from you , Noble Sir , Your humble ſervant , IOHN SALTMARSH .
