To the honourable the Committee for Contribution of moneys to the diſtreſſed Paoteſtants of Ireland . RIght Honourable , Neceſſity hath as many tongues and pens as Briarius hands , Argus eyes , or ſin advocates , and thoſe dictators of our misery's , never had a juſter cauſe than now to ſupplicate for their own ſilence , and by a divine proportion , Charity hath not only large bowels but many and open ears , ſo that the ſpeakers and auditors have and equality in number . No Nation hath had larger taſtes of the firſt , than the Engliſh in Ireland , nor any Nation ever produced a larger crop of the laſt ( to furniſh the firſt ) than England ) : The train oil of our calamities hath made the lamps of their Charities to ſhine the world over , while the oil from their cruſes and meal from their barrels hath not failed to furniſh , us & as they are to be honoured for this crop , we are alſo to honour you for the careful ſtoring and diſtributing thereof . Me thinks I find no year of Jehoaſh ſo famous as that in the 2 of Kings , 4 , 5. and 15. v. in which was the care to repair that holy fabric dedicated to God , and in that work nothing more glorious than the performance of that truſt by them that were to effect this repair ; for it ſeems the general contribution was not ſo rich or great , as the honeſty of thoſe entruſted . The calamitous Proteſtants are the temples of the holy Ghoſt , which like that ruined ſtructure , want repair , that a ſupply of the former cares and zeal were requiſite , & as thouſands cannot but praiſe God for the indefatigable pains and labours in your pious diſtributions , yet diverse that have stayed longeſt and ventured , ſuffered , and effected moſt , have not had ſo much as a taste of this honey , with Jonathan on the tip of their rod to cheer their feeble and fainting souls ſpent in the purſuit , and ſlaughter of thoſe Iriſh Philistines , who thirſt after ſome of the honey comb of Charity , pine for It , and moſt famiſh without it . I repine at no men success , but it appears to me that thoſe wyich brought their clothes and means away before the rebellion , had warmed a houſe , ſhould find Clothes , means and warmth here , when as ſuch as stayed to ſpend and venture their lives , and blou ſhould find neither , ſo that I muſt conclude our deſires to do ſervice there , detained us ſo , that now our deſires cannot be served . I am not ignorant what juſt cauſe of suspense may be given your honours from thoſe that uſurped the name of ruined Proteſtants , and of ſome which I could produce that have gone by their own virgin Surnames , their firſt husbands , and their husbands by two names , which cheating of the public charity , might juſtly incenſe your honours to explode the truly deplorable Petitioners which are as worthy of relief , as the others of puniſhment , were it the only labour of ſome known man , to examine the petitions , and ſubſcriptions , certificates , and perſons , this abuſe might be reformed , if not cured ; but I hope ſome particulars will nor eclipse , thoug it a darken a while a public good , and with Charity , which warmed theſe impoſtures will heat , ſuch as truly want her beams : the Sun alters not his courſe , becauſe the earth is full of lay-ſtals . No Act of the Apoſtles wins more upon me , than their public charity transferred into Judea to the diſtreſſed brothers , by the hands of Saul , and Barnabas in thoſe days of emptiness , Acts 11.29.30 . The ſame your honours are to us the ſons of conſolation , in which act of theirs , thete was not only a good purpoſe , but a proſecution . The care of Joſeph in proviping is not to be preferred before that of his diſtributing , by which he not only ſuſtained the ſubject , but enrich the King , you have the ſame power for what relief you offered to the members , Crowns the head ( Chriſt Jeſus ) who signs acquaintances to charitable works with his own hand ( inſomuch as you have done it unto one of theſe little ones , you have done it unto me . ) I more like the peace and charity of Conſtantine the firſt Chriſtian Emperor procured to the poor Chriſtians , then his erecting or repairing their Churches , and I more applaud that Centurion , for loving the Jewiſh nation , then for building them a Synagogue , becauſe the templls made with hands ( which I honur as public places appointed for Gods worſhip , may become dens of thieves , cages of uncleanness , or as amongſt the Iriſh ( Jewes in ſome traditions ) public market places , or what is more terrible as I have known the two moſt famous Cathedralls in Dublin made a meeting place for uncleanness , though all this while that holy pile is innocent , though abuſed , or which is yet worſe , may become Popiſh Sanctuaries , refuges for the moſt impious or laſtly be made the ſtorehouſes , or ſupporters to ſuch profane , and Idolatrous images , as the purer Temples of the Holy Ghoſt ( which Temples we are ) ſhall not only abhor , but demoliſh , as Moſes the Calf . The Apoſtles were not styled oratores , and vinatores , for their heavenly tilling , or pruning the Church , but for ſowing their bred upon the waters , and relieving the living vines , the diſtreſſed Saints , Oh heavenly Charity the laſt companion of the ſoul , thou immortal virtue , how many naked haſt thou to cloth , hurt to heal , hungry to feed , impriſoned to viſit , captived to ransom , fatherless to protect , harbourless to lodge , widows to defend , many of which thy lengthened arm hath reached , even as far as Argier , Germany , and that diſconſolate neighbour of thine , the moſt diſconſolate of all Lands groaning grieving , pernning Ireland , who according to her ancient custom , hath ſent thee , knowing yet Oh Englands charity , thy breaſts full of milk , and bones of marrow , ) thouſands of her children to ſofter , for there ſhe fears like Tekoahs widow , The bestial family is riſen upto deſtroy the heir , and quench his sparkle which is left , and ſhall not leave to her husband either name , or poſterity upon the earth , your honours being the pious agents to the Engliſh charity , may comfort this juſt necessary , and conſiderable complaint , ſaying with that heavenly hymniſt , go to thine houſe , and I will give a charge for thee , amongſt the reſt of the unrelieved , I come like Eſau from the Iriſh woods to your honours , to whom I ſpeak , as hero Iſaac , in the ſame words and bitterness , haſt thou but one bleſſing my Father , bless me , even me alſo my Father , and the God of compaſſion bless your Honours , that you as a cloud by day , and a pillar of fire by night , may help to led us that lately came from that land , now the houſe of bondage , in our poor and weary pilgrimage , to the land of promiſe , where God ſhall return your ſheaves with a harveſt theſe are the prayers of your devoted serve • .
