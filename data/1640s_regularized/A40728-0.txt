To the worthy Gentlemen , and Inhabitants of the Pariſh of St. Andrews HOLBORNE . I Hate Ingratitude as Witchcraft . To witness therefore to the world , both your courtesy to me , and my thankfulness to you , I give you this Piece , intended for your Pulpit ; but being occaſionally called to Grayes-Inne , delivered there what you ſhould have herd , and but once ; you may pleaſe now to ſee , and often , and in it the reality of my deſire to retribute ſomething : You know what S. Peter ſaid to the Creeple , What he had he gave him : you have been the chief preſervers of me and mine , ſince our eſcape out of Ireland , where we had only our lives for a prey , and thoſe lives your bounty hath hitherto cheriſhed . Which yet , does not more oblige me , then the loving acceptance of my weak endeavours ; with which encouragement I ſhall cheerfully proceed ſtill in my poor labours , and ſhall think my ſelf amid all my misfortunes very happy , if you ſhall ſo eſteem of me as I am , and deſire to express my self , Yours in all fair reſpect , THOUGH : ARTEFERTENSIS .
