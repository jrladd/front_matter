To the every way deserving and worthy Gentleman , M. Richard Gipps , eldest son unto M. Richard Gipps , one of the Judges of the Court of Guild-Hall in the City of London . SIR , WHen I had finished this discourse of The Worth of a Penny , or , A Caution to keep Money , and bethinking my self unto whom I should offer the Dedication , none came more opportunely into my thought then your self : for I imagined , if I should dedicate the same unto any penurious or miserable minded man , it would make him worse , and be more uncharitable and illiberal ; if unto a bountiful and free-minded Patron , I should teach him to hold his hand , and against his nature make him a miser . I to avoid either , made choice of your self , who being yet unmarried , walk alone by your self , having neither occasion of the one nor the other : Beside , you have traveled France and Italie , and I hope have learned thrift in those places , and understand what a virtue Parsimony is ; for want whereof , how many young heirs in England have galloped through their estates before they have been thirty ? Lastly , my obligation is so much to your learned and good father , and for goodness your incomparable mother , that I should ever have thought the worse of my self , if I had not Cum tota mea supellex sit chartacea , as Erasmus says : I had not expressed my duty and hearty love unto you one way or other , Whose in all service I am truly , Hen . Peacham .
