TO THE SUPEREMINENT PARAGON OF ART , AND Literature , the truly noble James Howell Esquire , Nestors Longevity and both world's Felicity . Honoured Sir , AS I did frequently take fresh air in your Dodonaean grove attending the Articulate , and intelligible susurrations of your ever verdant vegitals , ( to which former ages have nothing ( in that kind ) to assimulate , neither shall future times be able to parallel , ) from these Apollinean Plants of yours , I have slifted here a twig , and there a sprig , and I have bestowed some time in binding them in a bundle , which with my self I humbly offer to your approved censure , it being the Apex of my ambition to have your honoured self my justice in Eyre , I cannot say with Persius Nec scombros metuent mea carmina , nec thus for this confused truss of twigs ( as I may say ) though made of green wood , yet is it far from meriting any longevity , it deserves rather to kin - 〈1 … pages missing〉 Helena , Ariadne , and Phyllis , with other innumerable eminent endouments which bounteous nature hath liberally in all ages reposited in your lovely sex , as in the Apothecke or magasine of perfection , makes this my Gynophilian or amorous infant long rather to be dandled upon your tender knees , then lie reclused in a dusty study . If you please to bestow part of that time which you spend in other divertisements to converse with this poor brat of my brain , it will paint out unto you though with a quavering pencell , and in course and caligenous colours the passion of your royal Amorists , with inducements to commiserate them , the event whereof ( which may make them operative in this kind ) will perhaps make you repent no more of reading them , then I of composing them . When you talk with your children you expect from them no congruence or quaint language , yet you are often pleased to hear them prattle , & are delighted with their lisping Ideoms . This makes me hope that you will dispense with the Lallation & Low dialect of this babe , whose tone is rude , yet his meaning is plain dealing , which according to the proverb is a jewel , and consequently most fit for Ladies . Thus wishing you all delights , & happiness , endless like the rings you wear , & that the perjod of my pains may be the beginning of your pleasure , I remain Your Ladyshyps in all observance ROBERT BARON .
