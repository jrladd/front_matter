TO The moſt High Court OF PARLIAMENT . Moſt Honourable LORDS , And you moſt Noble KNIGHTS , CITIZENS , and BURGESSES of the Houſe of COMMONS : NOthing could fallen out more happily to me , then that my bold Adverſaries have appealed to your inviolable Juſtice ; for ſure I am , while you are ( as you ever will ) your ſelves , wiſe , and juſt , my cauſe cannot miſcarry in your hands . With no less , therefore , but better grounded confidence , I caſt my ſelf upon your unpartial judgement ; rejoicing to think , how clearly you will diſtinguiſh betwixt a facing boldness , and a modeſt Evidence of truth : How can I but receive courage from your pious , and juſt proceedings ? It is I that vindicate , theſe men oppoſe that holy Liturgy , which your moſt religious Order in this Active ſeſsion commanded to be entirely obſerved . How busy Faction is to cross that your moſt ſeaſonable Decree , every day yields new and lamentable proofs . If theſe endeavours of mine ſerve only for the purſuance of your ſo neceſſary , and gracious Act ; they cannot fear to be unwelcome . But , if I have hurt a good cauſe , by a weak and inſufficient handling , let me ſuffer in your cenſure , and let my Adverſaries triumph in my ſufferings . Contrarily , if after all their ſmooth inſinuations , it ſhall be found , that this champertous combination hath gone about , by mere shows of proof , to feed the unquiet humours of men , in the unjuſt diſlike of moſt juſtifiable , ancient , and ſacred Inſtitutions , and to caſt falſe blames upon my peaceable and ſincere managings of a certain Truth , let them pass for what they are , and feel that juſtice which they have appealed .
