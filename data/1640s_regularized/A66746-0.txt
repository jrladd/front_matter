To his EXCELLENCE the Earl of ESSEX , Lord General of the Army raiſed for defence of the KING , Parliament , and Kingdom . SIR , Until my Troop was diſabled , I ſerved faithfully with my SWORD , under your Command ( and eyewitness of your noble Patience , Conſtancy and Valour ) and ſhall again when my Troop is recruited : In the mean time , being engaged thereto ( by that emblematical device which I bear in my Cornet ) I have endeavoured to be ſerviceable with my PEN , that I might employ every faculty which God hath given me for the King and Parliament , to whom I am obliged by a double duty : and ( I hope ) not impertinently to the glory of the Almighty ; who , when moſt honourable teachers are not regarded , ſends men to learn of Piſmires and deſpicable creatures ; and , who for that cauſe , is now pleaſed to make uſe of ſuch a Vanity as I am : and ( it may be ) ſhall by this Engine , more ſtrengthen your Army , then a full Regiment of horſe . I have not here prefixed your Name , or tendered this to your perusal , merely for a private advantage : for , what can I hope to obtain , who am but Terrae filius , a child of contempt ? and , whoſe beſt endeavours have been hitherto , in outward reſpects , ( for upon other conſiderations , I have no reaſon to complain ) rather miſchievous , then profitable unto him . Neither preſume I to add any thing hereby to your Honour ( that being far above the dificiency needing ſuch mean Additions ) but , I being yet within the liſt of your Army , it ſeems reaſonable , that ſome Account ſhould be given of the time ſpent during my abſence from it : and I , having no better fruit ripe , thus , to preſent this , held it the duty , SIR , of Your EXCELLENCIES moſt humble Servant , Geo. Wither .
