To the truly Noble , and much honoured , Sr. ROBERT ANSTRUTHER Knight , and one of the Gentleman of his Majeſties Privy Chamber . SIR , IT is a poſition , and main Tenent agreed upon by the moſt judicious , that to attain unto Honour , Wisdom is the truly Polestar , and to retain it , Virtue the ſole Patroness : It being non ad tempus Invitamentum , said perpetuae virtutis premium . To which , though ſome have arrived by favour , others by fortune , yet it may be ingeniouſly confessed of You , that by Your own merit You have wone to this meridian : Into which the ſacred Majeſty of Great Brittaine having a true inſpection , out of many others , he made ſelect choice of you , ( for your known abilities ) to create his Lord Ambassador to the Majeſty of the Empire . And during your abided at Vienna in Auſtria , where the Emperor's Court was then kept , the Gentleman , Author hereof , Mr. Richard Hurſt ( now deceaſed ) your ( then ) ſervant and Secretary , at his more ſpare and retired hours , made this his Work his play , and in his moſt ſolitude his beſt ſolace . And unto whoſe Patronage may it more properly appertain , than to your Noble self , being writ in your foreign ſervice . This was the main inducement , which not only encouraged , but emboldened me to this preſentment , knowing that Honos alit Arts ; and the rather preſuming on your acceptance hereof , ſince they who in their life time the Muſes moſt favour , thoſe , after life , the nine Siſters moſt honour . Thus , with pardon for my boldness craved , I humbly take my leave of You. Yours in all Obſervance , S. B.
