TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT Earl of Warwick , Governor in Chief , and Lord High Admiral of all thoſe Iſlands and other Plantations of the Engliſh in AMERICA ; Together with the reſt of thoſe truly Honourable Members of both Houſes of Parliament joined in Commiſſion with him for ordering the affairs of the ſaid Plantations . Right Honourable , WEre not your Wisdom and experience in the great and weighty affairs of State ſo well known , and were ye not ſo much accuſtomed to the unjuſt complaints of clamorous perſons ▪ I might be diſcouraged to appear in the righteous cauſe of the United Colonies of New-England , and more eſpecially in the behalf of the Governor and Company of the Maſſachuſets , to render a reaſon of their juſt and righteous proceedings againſt Samuel Gorton and his Companions , who however ( where they are unknown ) they go here under the garb of a peaceable people ; yet if your Honours , and the reſt • f the Honourable Committee ſhall be pleaſed ( when more weighty employments ſhall give way ) to peruſe our juſt defence againſt his clamorous complaints , and ſcandalous Treatiſe , called , Simplicities defence againſt Seven-headed Policy , etc. I make no queſtion but ye will receive full ſatisfaction in what we have done , and be ready to justify our proceedings againſt them as godly and righteous . The reaſon wherefore I am forced to appear in Print before I give a particular anſwer to your Honou • s , and the reſt of the Honourable Committee , is , becauſe I find a more gross deformatory aſperſion caſt upon the Country to the public view of our Nation : which as it is deer in our eyes ( witness our frequent public ſolemn days of prayer to the Throne of grace for it , together with our private ſupplications , which the Searcher of the heart beſt knows , ſympathizing with it in every condition , to the loss of Ships , Goods , etc. to the great weakening of our eſtates ) ſo we deſire to remove whatſoever may ſadden the thoughts of our Nation againſt us ; eſpecially your Honours , and all that are godly in Chriſt Jeſus . What greater wrong can be done a poor perſecuted people that went into the wilderness to avoid the tyrannical Government of the late Hierarchy , and to enjoy the Liberties Chriſt Jeſus hath left unto his Churches ( which theſe blaſphemous Adverſaries of ours , ſo much ſleight and caſt off ) then to be accounted perſecutors of Chriſt in his Saints , yea , to go thither to that end , to become outrageously cruel , barbarouſly inhumane , uniting together to ſuck the blood of our Countrymen , etc. And yet Right Honourable , it will and does appear in the following Treatiſe , that Samuel Gorton was proſecuted againſt , Firſt , at Plymouth as a gross diſturber of the Civil peace and quiet of that Government , in and open factious and ſeditious manner . Secondly , he was no less troubleſome , but much more at Road Iſland , having got a ſtrong party to adhere unto him , affronting that Government ( as Plymouth ) in their public adminiſtration of Juſtice ſo foully and grossly , as mine ears never herd the like of any ; to which Relation in the following Diſcourſe I refer your Honours , being compiled as briefly as may be ▪ Gorton being there whipped in his perſon , and thence baniſhed with ſome of his principal adherents , they went next to Providence , where Mr. Williams , and ſome others have built a ſmall Town . This people receiving them with all humanity in a cold ſeaſon , when the former places could no longer bear his insolences ; he soon undermined their Government , gained a ſtrong party amongſt them to his own , to the great diſtraction of Mr. Williams , and the better party there , contending againſt their Laws , and the execution of Juſtice , to the effuſion of blood , which made Mr. Williams and the reſt ſadly complain to the Government of the Maſſachuſets , and diverse of them take the protection of that Government , to defend their perſons and eſtates . But when they ſaw Mr. Williams reſolve rather to loose the benefit of his labours , then to live with ſuch ill-affected people , and the neighbour Governments become affected with Gortons misrule there alſo , he ( and his Companions in evil ) began then to think of buying a place of a great aſp • ring Sachim , or Indian Prince , to the wrong of the proper Owners , ( two infer •• ur Sachims ) who alſo , as well as diverse Engliſh of Providence , ſubmitted their perſons and lands to the Government of the Maſſachuſets , and deſired their protection not only againſt the oppreſsing tyranny of Myantonimo the foreſaid Great Sachim , but againſt Gorton and his Companions , who intr • dead into their proper right , by unwarrantable means , etc. Now the Government of the Maſsachuſets having uſed all due means and none prevailing , but their gentleness anſwered with the greateſt contempt that might be : At the next Meeting of the Commiſsioners for the United Colonies they complained of Gorton and his irregular Companions , which the ſaid Commiſſioners took into ſerious conſideration , and the more becauſe of Gortons , etc. extraordinary familiarity with Myantonimo , and the reſt of the Nanohigganſet Sachims , who were known to be in a deep Conſpiracy againſt all the Engliſh in the Land at the ſame time . And therefore by a solemn Act gave liberty to the Government of the Maſſachuſets to call them to account , and proceed with them ſo far as might ſtand with righteousness and juſtice , which they accordingly did . Now theſe Right Honourable , etc. are the true cauſes of all the Cenſures and puniſhments that befell Gorton in the Country ; only needlessly in his and their contemptuous anſwers to the modest and well-ordered Writings of the ſaid Government of the Maſſachuſets , they b • lched forth ſuch horrid blaſphemies , not only againſt them in particular , and Civil Government in the general , but againſt the received Chriſtian Religion of all the Reformed Churches in Europe , as well as our ſelves ; Inſomuch as many tender Conſciences , both Miniſters and others , thought the Government did not well in giving him ſuch liberty , whereby he may and does ( as is reported ) poison other perſons and places with his corrupt opinions , to the great diſhonour of God , and ruin of the souls of his followers , who reject the means of grace Go • hath ſanctified to strength • hen and built up his people in faith and holiness . But that I may not be tedious , I ſhall preſume to prefer theſe following requeſts to your Honours and the reſt of the honoured Committee this Renowned Parliament hath betruſted with the affairs of the Foreign Plantatio • s of our Nation : The firſt is to ſtrengthen the Ceaſure of the Maſſachuſets by your favourable approbation , ſo far as it ſhall appear to be juſt and righteous ▪ and then ſhall the Cou • trey be the more preſerved from their fears of the Go • tonians deſperate cloſe with ſo dangerous enemies as their malignant neighbours the Nanohigganſets ; which I persuade my self , if you leiſures will ſuffer you to read the following Diſcourſe , you will eaſily condeſcend unto ▪ there being nothing ( I thank God in it ) affirmed by me , but as it is affirmed hereunto I may ſafely depoſe . A ſecond thing is , that ye will never ſuffer Samuel Gorton this peſtilent diſturber of our Societies , any more to go to New-England to diſquiet the peace thereof . My third requeſt is , that ye will be pleaſed to ſuffer New-Plymouth , to enjoy their former liberty in the line of their Government , which includeth their very ſeat , even Shawamet it self , where Gorton and his Company dwelled . My fourth requeſt is , to take into your ſerious conſideration , how deſtructive it will prove to the well-being of our Plantations and proceedings there , ( who by Gods bleſſing are growing up into a Nation ) here to anſwer to the complaints of ſuch malignant ſpirits as ſhall there be cenſured by Authority , It being three thouſand miles diſtant , ſo far as will undo any to come for Juſtice , utterly diſabling them to prove the equity of their cauſe , unless their eſtate be very great . My fifth and laſt requeſt is , that your Honours , and the reſt of the Honoured Committee will be pleaſed to patronise the weak labours of your humble ſervant , in the juſt defence he hath made for New-England , and the several Governments of it ( eſpecially the Maſſachuſets ) againſt the gross calumnies of the forementioned ſcandalous Treatiſe publiſhed by the ſaid Gorton : And herein ye ſhall not only oblige our Plantations of New-England to continue their daily requeſt to the God of all mercies for a bleſsing upon this Renowned Parliament , and your Honours , and the reſt of this Honoured Committee in especial , but to engage with , and for them and you , againſt all oppoſers of the State , to the laſt drop of blood in our veins ; yea , hereby ſhall you ſweeten the tedious travels , great charges and labours of me their unworthy Agent , who do and ſhall daily pray to God to recompenſe your vaſt hazards , expenſes , ſtudies , and cares , ( to advance the Weal Public of this diſtreſſed Kingdom , and the several limbs thereof ) with all the bleſsings of Heaven and earth to you and yours to ſucceeding Generations . Yours Honours humble devoted ſervant , EDVV . WINSLOVV .
