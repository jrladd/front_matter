TO THE HONOURABLE COMMITTEE OF THE HOVSE OF Commons Aſſembled in Parliament , Concerning plundered Miniſters . Worthy Sirs , FInding that the Honourable Houſe of Commons aſſembled in Parliament hath referred to your conſideration , and examination , ſome matters touching the Reformation of the Cathedral in Canterbury : out of my zeal to that work , I have preſumed to hold the Candle to you ( Physicians of valve ) a little to further your diſcovery of that Cathedralls corrupt conſtitution , that you may more perfectly cure the malignant diſeaſe , called the Cathedral evil . The work is begun , the numerous Idols , ( dunghill-gods , as the Scripture calls them ) which defile the worſhip of God there , are ſweeping out apace . And O that you would further cleanſe that Augean ſtable , by removing the Idol Shepherds ; Let not the oil of the fat revenues of that Cathedral Covent any longer feed ſuch dark Lamps , and Lanthorns , but let it ſupply burning , and ſhining lights , to enlighten thoſe many miſerable adjacent Pariſhes , which have a long time sat in darkness , under that huge , dry , flinty Rock , called a Cathedral . I have the enſuing Hiſtory ( for the moſt part ) from mine own obſervation , and have been punctual in examining the truth of what I have by information . My aim is to further the downfall of Babylon , and that Sion , which dwells with this daughter of Babylon , may deliver her self . So moſt humbly entreating your acceptance of this my obliged ſervice , I remain Yours to be commanded , RICHARD CVLMER .
