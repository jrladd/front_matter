To the Right Honoroble , Noble , and Worshipful , the Nobility and Gentry of England , addicted to History or Travel . R. Honourable , I Entreat you to accept of this Dedication , it being for the good of all those that have traveled , or desire to travel : for the one , it will instruct , and to the other , it will be necessary for the help of his memory . Look not on the smallness of the gift , but on the good will and affection wherewith I have translated it out of Italian into English , hereunto having also added many notes and observations of my last travels which I made these last two years through Spaine , Italy , and France . The work , I dare not say , deserves your protection , it being a greater token of Nobility , in you to patronise with your greatness that which is mean in it self , than only to be favourable where merit may challenge liberality ; yet the work is necessary for all this Kingdom , rich or poor , traveller or not traveller , wherein they may all benefit themselves , it serving for a guide to those that go abroad , and a Map for those at home . So I humbly take my leave , desiring the Almighty to bless and prosper you , and conclude with this Spanish Adage or Proverb , Lo que mata auno sana a otro , and say to the Critique that shall condemn that which he cannot mend himself , That which is one men meat , is another men poison . Let the more judicious judge . vale . Your Honours , in all service , J. W.
