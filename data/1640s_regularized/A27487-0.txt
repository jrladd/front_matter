TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS , AND The Knights , Citizens , and Burgeſſes , of the Honourable Houſe , of COMMONS . GReat Senators though in thoſe ſtormy times and Illiads of great affairs , we preſent to your Honours , as one did to Antipater a Treatiſe , the ſubject whereof is Happiness ; 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 yet we are Confident we ſhall have a better Anſwerthen I am not at leiſure . Our humble ſuit is , for the Pure Worſhip of the true God , and the quite aboliſhing of the Service-Book , with the Hierarchical Maintainers of it , both Enmity to Chriſt , Kingdom ; this ( as we conceive ) is the prime Work of the day , ſaving health is the greateſt good , Salus ſum mum b • num . and Purity in Worſhip is the only means to attain the End , and you are the Inſtruments of Inſtruments to advance this 〈 ◊ 〉 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 Work . We deſire no more of your Honours , but that the Reaſons of our requeſts may be weighed in the Balance of the Sanctuary , & ut res cum re , Hicrom & ratio cum ratione comparetur , that Matter with Matter , and Reaſon with Reaſon ( as a Father says ) may be compared , and that which is found light may be caſt out of the Sanctuary . It ſuits neither with the Honour of your Place , nor greatness of the work : that you ſhould either ſee with Dr. Halls eyes , or with ours ; but that Eye-clearing word , ſhould be the light of your Eyes , as we hope it is : the Doctor his Charging upon Gods people with Paſſionate reproaches , recoils enough upon himself ; though Tully telleth us , that bad Orators , inſtead of Reaſons , Use , Declamations , we could not have expected it from ſo great and Orator as the Doctor ; we seek not Corban nor Mammon , as our adverſaries do , but the Kingdom of Chriſt in the Purity of his Worſhip , which is firſt of all to be ſought ; for Reformations begins at the Sanctuary . You are thoſe Eliakims that muſt ſet the Lord upon his glorious Throne , and he will make you as Nails in a ſure place : to whoſe Honours we ſhall ever he devoted , In all humble Service .
