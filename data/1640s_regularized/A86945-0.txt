To the Honourable and excellently well accompliſh Sir Iohn Clotworthy Knight , and Colonel . I Shall not here Sir , poliſh or repeat The ſtory of your worth , nor tell how great You are in goodness as in fame ; how immenſe In your minds fair Republic ; how propenſe Indulgent nature hath been of her ſtore , By enriching you , thus to make others poor : Theſe as essential Truths , I might infer , From each Comma raiſe your Character ; But theſe ſoft lays I leave to ſuch ſoft wits Who teach their Muſe the trade of Parasites , To bombaſt easy greatness with , and pleaſe Their pampared Patrons with Hyperboles . My Muſe wears no ſuch maſque , nor can her Rhyme Lackey or hold opinion with the time . Invited hither to perform that due Tribute of thanks ſhe owes , and owes to you ; To you beſt Sir , who have a witness been Of what ſhe writes , to you Sir , who have seen Thoſe Tragedies ſhe treats of , and have known The loſſes of great Ulſter in your own . Then ſince ſhe's thus aſpired , ſhe humbly prays To let her Ivy wait upon your Baize .
