TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ▪ IAMES LORD MARQVIS OF Hamilton , Earl of Arren , and Cambridge , Lord Baron of Even , and Innerdale , Lord Master of his Majesties Horses , Knight of the most noble order of the Garter , and one of his Majesties most Honourable privy Counsel in both Kingdoms , etc. MY LORD , BEing confident , that your gracious disposition will hold in greater account the ingenuous meaning of who gives , then the sufficiency of the present : I here tender to the favour of your Honours acceptance a bundle of Epigrams ; Which though they be but flashes of wit , and such , as may with advantage receive point from your ordinary conceptions : yet for that nothing does better recommend them , then vivacity of conce • tO , I cannot figure to my fancy a fitter Patron to protect the sublimest Poems of this Nature , then your own Noble self ; of whose valour , and prudence , even from your infancy , both this , and foreign Nations will afford and approbation so Authentic , that by the universal consent of all , that ever knew your Lordship , the depth of experience since the memory of man was never seen wedded to fewer years : nor the splendour of heroic virtue to the astonishment of whole Armies , and Princes Palaces , more evidently apparent , then in the magnanimity of your generous carriage . What formerly , by the most virtuous , and pregnant wits , could not be acquired without a long continuance of time : and was esteemed to be incompatible with youth ( and much more extraordinary in young gallants , then grey hairs , or the Gout ) hath been still in your Lordship , a quality concomitant to the source of all your actions : coaevall with the gentile powers of your mind : and no less natural , then to speak , or think . And what others , not being able to reach into ( have therefore admired in the Legend of the Worthies ) hath , since the years of discretion , been the constant Object of your daily exercise , and complied with your very most neglected cogitations : Which glorious , and rare endowments , outreaching the extent of vulgar goodness , and seeming the more wonderful , that it is not long since by your birth , you did grace the World with the honour of your presence , do possess the faculties of my soul with a steadfast resolution , so unfeignedly to acknowledge the absolute right , your Lordship hath over me , and the inclinations of my mind : that , as I cannot impart that portion of the fruits thereof to any , which by a prior disposition is not already yours : so may not I ( though the matter be but small ) without breach of duty , devote this Dedication to another . Therefore ( my Lord ) you may be pleased , according to your accustomed manner , to vouchsafe a courteous entertainment to this testimony of my regard : till Fortune be so favourable , as to bless me with the opportunity , one day to make known my designments more effectually yours ; for the best of my affections , being touched with the Magnetic virtue of your good parts , are fixed on you , as on their Polestar which serves to direct the course of my life in a continual progress of embracing all the occasions , whereby I may testify , how earnest I am , and always shall be , deservingly to obtain the title Of Yours My Lord in all humility of sincere respect , to serve your Lordship .
