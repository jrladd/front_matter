To my Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . HOw much you may oblige , how much delight The wise and noble , would you die to night ; Would you like some grave sullen Nictor die , Just when the Triumphs for the Victory Are setting out ; would you die now to eschew Our Wreaths , for what your wisdom did subdue : And though they be bravely fitted for your head , Bravely disdain to wear them till you are dead ? Such Cynic glory would outshine the light Of Grecian greatness , or of Roman height . Not that the wise and noble can desire To loose the object they so much admire : But Heroes and Saints must shift away Their flesh , ere they can get a Holiday : Then like to Time , or Books feigned Registers , Victor's , or Saints , renowned in Calendars , You must depart , to make your valve known ; You may be liked , but not adored till gone . So cursed a Fate hath humane excellence , That absence still must raise it to our sense : Great virtue may be dangerous ; while it's here , It wins to love , but it subdues to fear : The mighty Iulius , who so long did strive At more then man , was hated while alive : Even for that virtue which was raised so high , When dead , it made him straight a Deity . Ambassadors , that carry in their breast Secrets of Kings and Kingdoms Interest , Have not their calling full pre-eminence , Till they grow greater by removing hence : Like Subject's , here they but attend the Crown , Yet swell like Kings Companions when they're gone : My Lord , in a dull calm the Pilot grows To no esteem for what he acts or knows , But sits neglected , as he useless were , Or coned his Carded , like a young Passenger : But when the silent winds recover breath , When storms grow loud , enough to waken death , Then were he absent , every Traffiquer Would with rich wishes buy his being there . So in a Kingdom calm you leave no rate , But rise to valve in a storm of State . Yet I recant ; I beg you would forgive , That in such times I must persuade you live : For with a storm we all are overcast , And Northern storms are dangerous when they last . Should you now die , that only know to steer , The winds would less afflict us then our fear : For each small Statesman then would lay his hand Upon the Helm , and struggle for Command , Till the disorders that above do grow , Provoke our curses , while we sink below .
