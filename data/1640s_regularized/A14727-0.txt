To the most Excellent Majesty of the Royal CHARLES , etc. Oh KING live for ever , and be graciously pleased to take in good part this little Stone , and this little Book , which is and Interpreter of the Virtues thereof . A Stone if your Majesty regards the price , to be less esteemed then the meanest Gem. But if you respect its use and profit in the Art of Navigation and Dyalling , yea and in Divinity it self ; it is not to be counted deer , though in comparison of the most precious Diamond . If the quantity of it be considered , it scarce exceeds a little clod of Earth : But if we consider the respects it hath to the Arctic and Antarctic poles to the Tropick circles and the Aequinoctial , then it equals the Terrestrial ▪ Globe , hereupon it was deservedly called by the name Terrell • as Gilbert the founder of this Magnetic discipline hath termed it ; If we look upon its outward show and beauty , there is no smoothness , no brightness in it , as in Pearls , it hath no splendour , no transparency , as other precious stones : therefore by Claudian it is called Decolor ill coloured . And by Berchori •• ferrugineus of the colour of rusty Iron , but if the inward force and virtue of it be considered , it does exceedingly surpass the most precious stones , for which cause by ancient Grecians was called 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 strong or as famous among stones , as 〈 ◊ 〉 was among men , by the latter Gretians it was termed 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 , mirificus a stone that does wonders for it is enrich ' • by nature with • h wonderful and secret endowments ▪ it produceth admirable effects , it cares the Gout , Cramp , and Head - • changed , if we give credit to 〈 ◊ 〉 bodeus and Pictorius , • ho hath made a Comment upon him , unto which the same Author adds , that it makes such as possess it . Eloquent and acceptab • e to Princes , Oh me s • lice • , s • vera diceret . O happy me if that he speak the truth . By your Majesties good leave , I dare promise this with good assurance that if your Majesty alone were the possessor of it , it would easily make you the Monarch of the whole world , for to them that pass the Seas , this stone is another Neptune , and most faithful conductor to the havens , and to them that travel by land another Mercurie , a most certain guide in all journeys , especially because it is the most powerful ruler of the Iron generation , which easily subject's all other metals , and in that respect also , it is the most excellent pattern and lively Emblem of your most admirable Monarchical and mild Government , for this was always my constant and undoub •• worser opinion , this I always thought with the greatest Politicians and Divines , and openly professed it before all men , that and hereditary Monarchy , ( such as this is , under which it was my happy lot to draw my vital breath , to enjoy all sorts of blessings , and to live in all godly conversation and tranquillity , is by many degrees the most profitable , and most praiseworthy of all forms of Government , which are any where used , or that can be imagined ; unto this Monarchical Estate I have always wished well , as he knoweth who searches my heart and reins . Furthermore it is approved by the consent of all Writers , and by the Mottoes of many Emperors , that a Magnetic manner of Governing is most safe , most acceptable , and most commodious , both for Princes and Subject's , for as sugar , ( according to the testimony of Fernelius ) does the very same things , and all in a better and sweeter manner then honey does , so a Magnetic affection does effect more then flavish terror , and a filial love of subject's , is better then servile fear . Behold how the Loadstone subdues to it self all kind of Iron , which otherwise is scarce wrought upon , by files , hammers , and fierce , it is done , not by force of Arms , but by help of love . So the Iron is held in a du • ifu • l subjection , being united together by the mutual bonds of friendship ; in like sort l • tO the people see and consider with me how the Iron dust , that confused multitude , grows tO • gether in • oh one body , under the Loadstone , as it were their King , how it stands still with a kind of quaking affrightment , and does cover it in the form of a shield , it does compass about the Loadstone , after the manner of a Guard , it does yield sustenance and service unto it , as the Bees do to their King or Master be , which is without a sting ; a clear and illustrious Hieroglyphic , of Christs Dominion over those that are his , a • ype whereof he long since exhibited in David unto whom he gave a name derived from love , of whom that which is singular and rarely befalls Princes , is recorded , that all which the King did , seemed good in the eyes of all the people ; the King of Kings gran • that our people may universally obey their King , the Magistrate ▪ and Prelates , with such r • adinesse of wi • l , that that • y strive among themselves by mutual emulat • on , how one may go befo • e , and excel the other in performing the due Offices of subject's : the same gracious God grant that your Majesties Empire may be to your enemies and adversaries adamantine , but Magnetic to your • ubjects and friends , and that your Majesty may be gr • ciously pleased to favour him , who if by Art or hap , he had found that Stone , which they commonly call the Philosophers Stone , would have presented it with the like inclination and alac • city , as he does most humbly and willingly present , and dedicate this Loadstone , together with this short Commentary upon it , which indeed of right and de • ert is due unto your Highness ; for to whose service should he consecrate this dear Loadstone , but • oh his dearest Sovereign . This Load • tone , a Stone of great virtue , but to a great and virtuous King , this Sea N • ptune or Guide ; but to the Lord of the Seas which compass so many Lands , this powerful and mild Ruler of Iron but to the most Mighty • and Clement King ; so does he profess , who wished unto your Majesty the cel • bration of a • hundred birthdays in this world , and one joyful never ending day in the world to come , which shall ever be the prayer of him who is , of Christs Ministers the least , but Your Majesties most loving faithful and ob • dient subject ▪ S.
