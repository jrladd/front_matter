TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , MOST WORTHY and Noble Lords , the Noblemen , and others of the Covenant of Scotland . May it pleaſe your Lordship's , ACcording to your honours directions , the Scouts ( which were ſent into England , to diſcover the eſtate of things there ) came unto me their Intelligencer at London , who have collected together all ſuch obſervations , as they in their several travels have found , or my self obſerved , either in my own abode now two years at London , or in my returning home : But by reaſon of all paſſages now ſhut up at ſea , and all Land ways belayed , I was forced to put my self in Arminian Attire , and ſo came home through England , and ſo remained ſome certain time in the Camp Royal , where my Collections may manifeſt my love to my Country , and care of the truſt by your Lordship's impoſed upon me . But if my obſervations be not anſwerable to your Lordship's expectations , I am heartily ſorry : Yet , ye may ſee , I have not been altogether idle , nor will be more careless hereafter ( as occaſion is offered ) then formerly I have been , and ſhall in my Northern news ( which is alſo now in collecting ) make good what is omitted , and in confidence of your favourable acceptance hereof , I reſt , Your Honours moſt humble ſervant , D.
