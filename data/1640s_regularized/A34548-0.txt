TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Lady Teynbam : Her humble Servant N. N. wishes eternal Beauty , both in this world , and the world to come . Madam , I Have read that a poor and mean Lamp of a great Philosopher , hath been sold at a great price ; And I have seen a Medail , which in the intrinsic valve was worth little , sold at a great rate , because it had the Name and Image of some great Person stamped upon it . I therefore that I may gain and extrinseque valve to this Book , have presumed to dedicate it unto you , Madam , in hope that your Nobleness and gentleness is as great as your Beauty , which delights and causeth admiration in the eyes of all , but those of the envious : And that you will in the permission of your Name to be set before this Book , imitate the custom of Kings , who set their Names on coins of Copper , as well as on those of Gold ; and as the King that coins , sets what valve he pleases on his Money ; so when your name is set to his Work , I will give it what price 〈 … 〉 please , and every wise person will • … uy it .
