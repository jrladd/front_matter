Right Honourable , THe unworthy oppreſſed Author hath not long ſince groaned under the ſevere cenſure of the late high Commiſsion for the ensuing ſpeculations , which now he adventures to preſent unto your Honour , hoping for a candid acceptance , and interpretation of his poor endeavours for the good of Zion . Had not the riſing Sun of and auſpicious Parliament diſpelled thoſe clouds of oppression and tyranny , that menaced a drowning both to me and them , they had been choked in their embrio , and never enjoyed the happiness they have now attained in your Honourable aſpect . Pardon ( moſt noble Lord ) the enforced preſumption of the diſtreſſed Author , which implores and hope's for your honourable Patronage , and humbly praying for the daily increaſe of your Honours health and eternal happiness , remains Your Honours moſt humble , moſt devoted Servant , William Fenwick .
