To the much honoured , Sir IOHN WENTWORTH , and Sir IOHN ROWSE Knights : With the rest of the Right Worshipful the Commissioners for the County of Suffolke , Council and Strength . RIGHT WORSHIPFUL , BY the appointment , and in the presence of some of you was this Sermon preached . And at the like request it is now published together with and addition of a Supplement to the Applicatory part , which was then through straitness of time left imperfect . My aim in both was , and is to promote the public service of the Kingdom , and in particular the service of that day . If herein I have not done what haply some would have had me , by speaking their conceptions , I would have them and the world know , I have done what I conceived most expedient for the promoting of the service which then I was put upon , and ( as far as I apprehend ) the great design of the Kingdom . That I have herein concealed my own private judgement in the point of Church Government , It is not because I am afraid or ashamed to give account of it , but only that I might not by and unseasonable anticipation of the judgement of that venerable Assembly now convened for the deciding and stating of that controversy , both render my self seemingly presumptuous , and lay blocks in my own way , by sowing of scruples , which my work was to remove and pull up . What success God was pleased to give unto my poor labours at that time , some of you are witnesses . My hope's are , that being not altogether unsuccessful in the hearing , they may prove not wholly unuseful in the reading . Such as they are , I presume to put them into your hands ; laying both them and my self at the Churches feet . Whose I am , and ever shall be JOH : BRINSLEY .
