To the Reader . COurteous Reader , The diſeaſe to which this Cure is applied , is epidemical . The hearts of men being anatomized , it will be found , that the grand cauſe of their alienation from , and oppoſition unto the ways of God : is a ſecret obſtruction , ariſing from that which as the ſeed of it , the Author calls Miſpriſion . This Book deſcribes the diſeaſe very lively , in the Symptoms of it , and preſcribes the Cure in a very artificial method ; laid down in great variety of matter , and elegancy of conveyance . The receipt is made up of well choſen ingredients : ſtrong , and therefore likely to be operative ; ſweet , & thereby inviting the patient to take it . If the Jaundice be removed out of thy eye whereby the things of God have been repreſented to thee in a falſe colour : Let the chief Physician have all the glory of thy recovery , which is all the reward the confectioner expects for his pains . THO : GOODVVIN . JO . ARROVVSMITH . RICHARD VINES .
