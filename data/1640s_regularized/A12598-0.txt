TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD , WILLIAM , BY THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE , LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBVRY , PRIMATE OF ALL England and Metropolitan , one of the L L. of his Majesties most Honourable Privy Council , and Chancel or of the University of OXFORD . May it please Your Grace . AS without the concurrence of diverse good reasons to induce me , I had not presumed to present unto Your Grace the following Discourse : So I conceive it very fitting , and my bounden duty , to give Your Grace , and the world , and Account in brief , of the inducements whereby I have been animated to appear in this kind before Your Grace . The chief whereof hath been , and is , Your Graces interest both in the Author , and in the Work . In the Author , as subsisting in his place and profession , under God , chiefly by your Graces favour and Goodness . In the Work , in a double respect : the one , as it is a Discourse of Antiquities ; Your Graces extraordinary care and cost for the Collection whereof , of all sorts , from all parts , Crowned by Your singular Piety and Nobleness in disposing them to the good and service of the public ; as they are thankfully acknowledged and worthily celebrated by all the Lovers of Antiquities ; so do they give Your Grace and especial interest to all their Labours who are that way inclined . The other ; as it handleth more especially the Antiquities of two such Particulars as are of very near relation to Your Grace , the Church , and City of Canterbury . These reasons ( may it please Your Grace ) not to trouble You with more , in all Humility I hope , may prevail with Your Grace for Your patience and pardon of this presumption : and though not procure Your Graces acceptance and protection of the Work , yet Your excuse of the Authors boldness , who most humbly craves it at Your Gracious Hands : and with his hearty Prayers , both for the long continuance of Your Graces Health and Happiness here , to Gods Glory and the good of His Church , and for Your endless bliss hereafter , prostrates both Himself and His Labours at Your Graces Feet with that reverence which becomes The meanest of Your Graces Servants , William Somner .
