To the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount SAY and SEAL , and Lieutenant General CROMWEL . Noble Patriots , IF I miſtake not , you may here ſingle out ſomething of the Lords from what is mine , and diſcern ſome beams of God amongſt many things of man . I know the candle of the Lord cannot ſhine anywhere with more ſnuff then in me ; however ſince the Lord hath lighted it , I dare not but let it ſhine ( or rather glimmer ) before men . I have writ your Names to my Book that I may be one of your Remembrancers amongſt the reſt to the advancement of Truth ; not but that they who know you , know you to be acted by a Spirit of Truth in your ſelves . The Lord remember you according to all the good you have done ( in your ſeveral Miniſtrations ) to this people ; and do that for you which gives you moſt , and yet takes moſt from you , even filling you with himſelf , till he hath emptied you of all but his own glory , and gathered you up into the fullness and righteousness of himſelf in Chriſt , where we are only nothing in our ſelves , and every thing in him ; and ſurely the moſt , and beſt , and greateſt thing he can do for the ſons of men , is , thus to make them nothing in their own account , that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord . I may ſeem ſtrange to wiſh you thus ; but I know it is not ſtrange to you , who know the Myſtery of the Spirit , and of Chriſt . My Lord , and Sir , Go on ſtill , yet ſtill laying your designs in a glory above that of States and Kingdoms , and involving all your counſels there , where there is moſt of Heaven , and leſt of the World . So prays Your Servant in the Lord JOHN SALTMARSH .
