TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , And Virtuous Lady , Frances Manors , Countess of Rutland . Madam , BY the Judicial Law of the Jewes , if a servant hadExod . 21. 4. children by a wife which was given him by his Master , though he himself went forth free in the seventh year , yet his children did remain with his Master , as the proper goods of his possession . I ever have been , and shall be a servant to that noble Family , whence your Honour is extracted . And of late in that house I have been wedded to the pleasant embraces of a private life , the fittest wife , and meetest Helper that can be provided for a Student in troublesome times : And the same hath been bestowed upon me by the bounty of your Noble Brother , EDW : Lord MONTAGUE : Wherefore what issue soever shall result from my mind , by his means most happily married to a retired life , must of due redound to his Honour , as the sole Proprietary of my pains during my present condition . Now this Book is my eldest Offspring , which had it 〈1 page duplicate〉 〈1 page duplicate〉 been a Son , ( I mean , had it been a Work of Masculine beauty and bigness ) it should have waited as a Page in Dedication to his Honour . But finding it to be of the weaker sex , little in strength , and low in stature , may it be admitted ( Madam ) to attend on your Ladyship , his Honours Sister . I need not mind your Ladyship how God hath measured outward happiness unto you by the Cubit of the Sanctuary , of the largest size , so that one would be posed to wish more then what your Ladyship does enjoy . My prayer to God shall be , that shining as a Pearl of Grace here , you may shine as a Star in Glory hereafter . So rests Your Honours in all Christian offices , Though : Fuller .
