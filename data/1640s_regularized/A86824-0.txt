To his truly noble , and worthily honoured friend THOMAS STANLEY Eſquire . My dearest friend , SInce it is the hard fortune of theſe glowworms to ſee day , I wiſh they might have paſſed your examination ; for I know you to be a ſevere Critic in Poetry , aſwell as in Philology , and the Sciences : But ſince others importunities , and mine own preſſing occaſions , have denied it , I must preſent them loaded with their own blemiſhes , that being fitter Objects of Pardon , they may draw in pardoning , more demonſtrations of your Candor , and add to my Engagements , could they receive Augmentation . I will not commit a Rape upon your modeſty by any praiſes , though Truth her ſelf might be your Panegyriſt , and yet continue naked ; give me only leave to tell you from mine own experience , that Love is more then a mere Sympathy : for admiration did firſt attract my thoughts to you , and after fix them ; though it were only your innate sweetness that received them with and undeſerved entertainment . Sir What I was firſt indebted to you at Durham I endeavour to acquit in part here at Cambridge : for the Total , though it be rather above my ability , then deſires , yet ſhould I hate the thought of a General diſcharge , let me only beg of you that theſe Cherryſtones may draw from you your own Pearls , which cannot but break themſelves a day through that darkness to which you now confine them . Let us once ſee Fancy triumph in the spoils of the richeſt Learning , there will many ( not doubt ) press to follow the Chariot , yet ſhall none be more forward then Sir , Your moſt affectionately devoted ſervant J. HALL St. JOHNS Jan. 6. 1646.
