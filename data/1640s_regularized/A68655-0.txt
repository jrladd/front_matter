TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND TRULY NOBLE MINDED , IOHN CARY , VISCOVNT ROCHFORD , My Lord , YOur right Noble willing mind ( though serious occasions could not permit you ) to see this Tragedy Acted , emboldens me ( through the confidence I have in your sweet disposition ) to present it unto you , the Heir and Honour of your Great and Noble Family : Emperatricis libido , periculosissima est , witness Valeria Messallina , her Lust and Rule over doting Majesty . This testified by Romes Historians , ( Tacitus , Suetonus , Pliny , Plutarch and Iuvenall ) the world ( unless among the crooked conditions of the Envious ) may ( being honestly opinionated ) perceive , that the sole Aim of my discovery herein , no otherwise tends then to separate Souls from the discovered Evil , the suppression of Vice , and exaltation of Virtue , flight from sin for fear of Judgement ; which seriously considered in a Noble nature . The glorious Strumpet , sparkling in beauty and destruction can never have power to tempt : This Play upon the Stage , passed the general applause as well of Honourable Personages as others : And my hope is , the perusal will prove no less pleasing to your Honour . Two passages are past , the Stage and the Press ; nothing is absent now but the gentle approbation of your Lordship's clemency to confirm the endeavour of him that truly is â–ª Your Lordship's true Honourer , Nathanael Richards .
