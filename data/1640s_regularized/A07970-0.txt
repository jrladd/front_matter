TO THE GENERALTY OF His Noble friends , Gentlemen of the several Honourable Houses the Inns of Court â–ª GENTLEMEN , I Have presumed thus upon you , to countenance my shame fact Bride ; who now she is pressed blusheth to appear in public , through fear she hath of a new danger from public censure . She is here dressed according to mine own desire and intention ; without ought taken from her that my self thought ornament ; nor supplied with any thing which I valued but as rags . Your favourable opinion , and your acceptance of her into your protection , will take off her fears , and make her present her self front laeto : and the honour that you do me thereby will add : to those many engagements that bind me always to declare my self Your most thankful servant . THOMAS NABBES .
