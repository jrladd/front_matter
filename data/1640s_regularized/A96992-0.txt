The Epiſtle Dedicatory ▪ Oh Pierce my heart with fervent love of thee ! God . The beauty of thy face , Lord , let me ſee ! Riſe from thy cloudy Eaſtern cloisters black , Spread forth thy glorious beams and be not ſlack , To thawe my Icy heart , which sin hath frozen , Aſſure my conſcience , Lord , I am thy choſen . And thou my Sovereign , The King . Charles , all Europs splendour , Thine enemies terror and true Faith's Defend • r , Thy love preserved my life , not heatheniſh fate , In thy Majestic face , true Princely ſtate : When malice plotted miſchief every hour , Thy clemency prevented all their power : That God which graced thee with a Royal Crown , Crown thee with grace , thy Honours with renown . * All you poor souls whoſe ears have been abuſed , People . With ſcandalous reports and eyes traduced With charms of turbulent ſpirits ; new take and view , This Declaration honeſt , plain , and true . Per Henry Walker Cantab.
