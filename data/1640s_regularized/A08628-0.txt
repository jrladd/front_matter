To the Right Worshipful Sir Iohn Suckling Knight . Sir , OVids youngest daughter dressed in black , and like a mourner drowned all in tears , does come to desire your favour , that since you have honoured the Muses with a famous Poem , you would express your noble mind in defending her from the censure of the world . She does not mourn like some dissembling heir in formal black , but does show unfeigned grief for Ovids sorrow : And though virtue does not always run in a blood , yet I hope she will not worser sgrace him from whom she did derive her birth , but rather merit than â€¢ my service in waiting on her to so noble a Patron may be accepted , that while she is entertained , I for her sake may be acknowledged , The servant of your worthy virtues , Wye Saltonstall .
