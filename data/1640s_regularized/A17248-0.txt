TO HIS MUCH HONOURED Father in Law , William Purefey of Calldecoate in Warwkickshire , ESQUIRE .

And might your wishes have effect , doubtless , it would prove a useful work , and serviceable to God , and to his Church ; yea , ( if my judgement fail me not ) in the next place to the translation of the Scripture into our mother tongue ; whereunto the Lord stir up the hearts of those whom he hath designed for so happy and employment as is the holding forth of so great light , and facilitating of Scripture studies , to the filling of theHab . 2. 14. earth with knowledge , as waters cover the Sea. Your ever obliged Son in Law , GEORGE ABBOTT .
