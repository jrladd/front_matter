To the Chriſtian Reader . READER , THou canſt not be ſuch a ſtranger in our Izrael , as that it ſhould be neceſſary for me , to acquaint thee , with the firſt ſowing and ſpreading of theſe Tares in the Field of the Church , much less to declare , what diviſions and thoughts of heart , what open bitter contentions , to the loss of Ecclesiastical peace , have been ſtirred up amongſt us about them : only ſome few things relating to this my particular endeavour , I would willingly premoniſh thee of . Firſt , Never were ſo many prodigious errors introduced into a Church , with ſo high a hand , and ſo little oppoſition , as theſe into ours , ſince the nation of Chriſtians was known in the world , the chief cauſe I take to be , that which Aeneas Sylvius gave , why more maintained the Pope to be above the Council , then the Council above the Pope , becauſe Popes gave Archbishoprics , Bishoprics , etc. but the Counsels ſued in forma pauperis , and therefore could scarce get and Advocate to plead their cauſe : the fates of our Church having of late devolved the government thereof into the hands of men tainted with this poison , Arminianism became backed , with the powerful Arguments , of praiſe and preferment , and quickly prevailed , to beatrice poor naked truth into a corner : It is high time then for all the lovers of the old way , to oppoſe this innovation , prevailing by ſuch unworthy means , before our breach grow great like the Sea , and there be none to heal it . My intention in this weak endeavour , ( which is but the undigeſted iſſue of a few broken hours , too many cauſes in theſe furious malignant days , continually interrupting the courſe of my ſtudies ) is but to stir up ſuch , who having more leisure , and greater abilities , will not as yet move a finger , to help vindicate oppreſſed Truth . In the mean time I hope this diſcovery may not be unuseful , eſpecially to ſuch who wanting either , will or abilities , to peruſe larger diſcourſes , may yet be allured by their words which are ſmoother then oil , to taste the poison of Asps that is under their lips : Satan hath 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 , depths where to hide , and methods how to broach his lies : and never did any of his Emiſſaries employ his received talents with more skill and diligence , then our Arminians : labouring earneſtly in the firſt place to in ſtill ſome errors that are moſt plauſible , intending chiefly and introduction of them that are more palpable , knowing that if thoſe be for a time ſuppreſſed , until theſe be well digeſted , they will follow of their own accord : wherefore I have endeavoured , to lay open to the view of all , ſome of their foundation errors , not uſually diſcuſſed , on which the whole inconſiſtent ſuperſtructure is erected , whereby it will appear , how under a moſt •• ine pretence of furthering Piety , they have prevaricated againſt the very grounds of Chriſtianitie : wherein Firſt , I have not obſerved the ſame method in handling each particular Controversy , but followed ſuch several ways as ſeemed moſt convenient to clear the truth and diſcover their hereſies : Secondly ſome of their errors I have not touched at all , as thoſe concerning universal grace , juſtification , the final Apostasy of true believers : becauſe they came not within the compass of my propoſed method , as you may ſee Chap. 1. where you have the sum of the whole diſcourſe . Thirdly , I have given ſome inſtances , of their oppoſing the received Doctrine of the Church of England , contained in diverse of the 39. Articles : which would it did not yield us iuſt cauſe of further complaint , againſt the iniquity of thoſe times whereinto we were lately fallen : Had a poor Puritan offended againſt half ſo many Canons , as they oppoſed Articles , he had forfeited his livelihood , if not endangered his life : I would I could hear any other probable reaſon , why diverse Prelates were ſo zealous for the diſcipline , and ſo negligent of the Doctrine of the Church : but becauſe the one was reformed by the word of God : the other remaining as we found it in the times of Popery . Fourthly , I have not purpoſely undertaken to anſwer any of their Arguments , referring that labour to a further design : even a clearing of our Doctrine of reprobation , and of the adminiſtration of Gods providence , towards the Reprobates and over all their actions , from thoſe calumnious aſperſions they caſt upon it , but concerning this , I fear the diſcouragements of theſe woeful days , will leave me nothing but a deſire : that ſo neceſſary a work , may find a more able Pen : IOHN OVVEN .
