TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery , etc. My Noble Lord , THe natural affection , which by the ſucceſſive virtue of your Family you have always born to Poetry , engages me in the abſence of the worthy Author , to preſent your Lordſhip this piece , that you , the beſt Maecenas of the age , might Patronise this beſt of Plays . Had Mr. Davenaut himself been preſent , he would have elected no other Patron but your Lordſhip , and in his abſence I beſeech you accept this Work of his ; whoſe excellence , I hope , will excuſe his boldness , who had no other ambition in the dedication , but that he might by public profeſſion be known to be that which has long time been in his private affection , The humble honourer of your Name and Family .
