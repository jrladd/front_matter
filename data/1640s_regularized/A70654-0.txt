To the Right honourable THE Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament : Right Honourable , THis plain piece , which ( were it worthy ) should be sacred to this excellent Man , memory , comes now also devoted to your service : It should have been his picture , but becomes your possession ; and let it be inter 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 , and that by your fourfold interest . 1. In himself , whilst he lived , every one of you deservedly esteeming him as a Friend , a Brother , if not a Father . 2. In his loss , • or rather yours of him ) which because I cannot describe , 〈 … 〉 veil over with silence . 3. In the work wherein he lived , and by which he died ; which was not so much his as yours ; or , yours , as your Countries , your Gods : in which he laboured so much , that he died the sooner , that you might have his better help towards the finishing of it , who ( through the mercy of God ) live longer . 4. In this mean Sermon , which by your command comes to public view , and therefore craves patronage in your favourable acceptance : The Lord make it yours by a greater right ; even by making the commands delivered in it to be so ingrafted in your hearts , that you may all not only with him be cast into the same mould , but that his Spirit may be so doubled upon you all , that you cheerfully and without fainting may bear whatever remaining heat and burden of the day ; and at last come to the same blessed evenings-reckoning , rest , and reward in everlasting life . So prayeth daily Your most unworthy Servant , in , and for Christ Iesus , Stephen Marshall .
