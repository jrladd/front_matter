TO THE RELIGIOUS , VERTVOVS AND Every way Accomplished Lady , • and his much honoured good Mother , the Lady RU • HE • CUDAM •• E. N •• le Lady , and my worthy Mother ; THERE are two chief reasons why I dedicated this Trea • i'm of the Promises unto your Ladyship First the excellency of the subject , with which I know you are much affected , 〈 ◊ 〉 My near relation and engagement unto your Self . I deemed none fit to patronise such a work , but some noble Theophilus , or Elect Lady ; and to have sought a remoter Friend having one so near and proper , might have been construed folly . I wish the Book may give content unto your Self , and others of Gods people , and then I doubt not , but the dedication of it unto a Christian , and such As Paula & Marcella were to Ierome , so is your Ladyship to those judicious persons , which resort unto you , a great Questionist , & they to whom you propound your doubts do tam proficere quam prodesse , as well benefit by you , as benefit you . a Christian , will be approved . The knowledge of the Promises is necessary for Christians , who do , or ought to live by faith , and therefore this Treatise ( I conceive ) may be generally useful unto them both for the right performance of holy duties , the exercise of divine graces , and likewise to uphold the soul in all manner of distresses . 1 It will be very useful for the right performance of any good duty . What better motive to and help for prayer , hearing , Quis virtutē amp • ectitur iosam , praemisi tollas , In • ë Sat. 10. He that believes not the jud • ements will never stick to do any evil , he that believes not the Promise • s will never be forward to do any good reading , meditation , conference , etc. then to call to mind Gods gracious promises which he hath made to assist us in those services , and to accept them rightly performed ? but because I handle this point in the Treatise it self , mentioning the special promises made to particular duties , I will here proceed after another manner , and show , how there are Promises in Scripture for every Commandment . For the first Commandment How many Promises are made to the true knowledge of God , Psalm 91.14 . to the true acknowledgement of God , Pro 6.3 . to the love of God , Pro. 8.17 . Iohn 14.23 .

Pro • 8. • 0. to the public Magistrate • hat deals justly in judgement , Pro. 16.12 . & 25.5 . & 15.27 . & 28.16 . to the private person that deals justly , Deut. 25.15 . to him that being just uses diligence in his calling , Pro. 10.4 . & 12.24 . For the 9 Commandment , See 1 Pet. 3.10 . Lu. 6.37 . Gen 1 • .3 . Pro. • 3.2 . & 18.20 . & 20.15.22 . most ample goods are promised to those that speak the truth from the heart , Ps. 15.9 . Pro. 12.19 23. For the 10 Commandment , See 2 Pet. 1.4 . Mat. 5.8 . Iam 4.5.6 . 2 Cor. 1 • .9 . Pro. 22.5 , 11. Ps. 24.4 , 5. & 3. • . Pro ! 14.2 • . Thus graciously does God deal with his people , he might out of his absolute sovereignty over us , command only , and we were bound then to obey ; but he is pleased ( the better to quicken us to obedience ) to annex these gracious promises , to his righteous Commandments , and those that truly perform the duty which he commands , shall undoubtedly receive the mercy , which he promises . Secondly , this Treatise of the Promises , may be useful ( I suppose ) for the quickening and exercising all holy graces . How does the found knowledge and frequent meditation of Gods sweet and precious Promises , strengthen Faith , quicken hope , in flame zeal , confirm patience , and foster all the graces of Gods Spirit ? When we stagger through unbelief , and are tempted to doubt of any thing , if we would have recourse to the promises , they would uphold us ▪ as for example , if this cogitation should arise in me , certainly if I do not as the world does , I shall lose my credit , and never come to any wealth , or estate like others , by & by I should remembering • mber what is written touching this matter , Sam. 3. • 0. Mat. 6.33 . and then consider the gen • rality • and certainty of these & other promises , and that would settle the soul . Lastly , against all troubles • nward , outward , painful , sinful , of soul , body , good name , state , Faith in Gods promises is a sovereign Antidote ; this is my comfort in my affliction ( sai • h David ) thy word ( that is , thy promise made unto me in thy Word ) hath quickened me , Ps. 119.50 . He telleth not what kind of trouble he was in ; in any trouble whatsoever , he received singular comfort by meditation in the Promises : by Gods promises , adversity , sickness , poverty & death of Friends are sweetened , we are upholden by them in time of temptation , and in the pangs of death , receive consolation : Against all Evil that may assail us , 3 thing • there are that we may with joy behold in the promise ; 1 Protection , 2 Restitution , 3 Deliverance . Does the Lord permit us to temptation ? his grace is sufficient to support us , 2 Cor. 12 9. does he suffer us to be overcome in temptation ? yet promises he restitution , by a new act of grace , raising us , and at length to set us out of the reach of all temptations . In the defects of good things , and the small measures thereof , we may draw comfort likewise from the promises . God promises , • Preservation , 2 Growth , 3 Perfection , of •• ace and glory . If we enjoy a • y good grace of God , though •• never so weak measure ; first • e assures us , that little is a • ledge of more , 2 Cor. 1.22 , • econdly , even that little , he • ill enable to get final victo • y , Rev. 3.8 . and will perfect • tO to the day of the Lord Ie • us , Phil. 1.6 . and after this • ife make us pure as he is • ure , perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect . Thus we see what Balm • her is in Gilead , what sweet • es in Gods promises ; they are • he Christians aqua vitae , to • evive him , when he is ready • oh swoon ; in all or in any estate be may extract abundance of 〈1 page duplicate〉 〈1 page duplicate〉 comfort from that thrice precious promise , Ps. 84.11 . and those three heavenly conduits of sweetest consolation , Rom 8.18 , 28 , 32. and if one or a few verses afford so much comfort , what cordial sweetness and refreshing may a Christian suck , out of all those wells and breasts of consolation and Salvation ? Indeed the Faithful can never want grounds of comfort . First GOD the Father is the GOD of all consolation , Esa. 12.3 . comforting them in all their troubles , Esay 66.11 . 2 Cor. 3.4 . Secondly , CHRIST is the Fountain of comfort , for 5 , Thirdly , the HOLY GHOST 〈 ◊ 〉 the Comforter of all the • aithfull , • o . 14.16 , 20. & 15 • 6.7 , 1 Fourthly , all the Scrip • ure makes for their comfort , • oh . 1 • .4 . The whole Gospel is a plentiful Storehouse of Comfort , called 1 Good or gladsome tidings Esay 9.3 . • 2. • and a good word , Heb. 6.5 . because it cheereth the heart , as good news does him that is in heaviness ▪ 2 The Gospel of Peace , Rō . 10.15 . Eph 6.15 . because it pacifieth a troubled conscience : but the very pith , marrow and quintessence of all true consolation is contained in the Evangelicall promises , Psal 119.92 . Thus assuring my Self , that your Lady ship will often peruse this book , wishing tha • your Soul may daily prospe • by it , and that the LORD woul • now fill you with all joy and • peace in believing these promises , 3 Ep of Iohn 2. Rom. • 5.1 ▪ and hereafte • crown you with all happiness in the full fruition of the things promised , I rest , Your obliged Son and Servant , EDWARD LEGH
