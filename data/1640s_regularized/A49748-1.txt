TO HIS Moſt Sacred Majesty , CHARLES , BY THE GRACE OF GOD , King of great Brittaine , France and Ireland , Defender of the Faith , etc. I Could not anſwer mine own Conſcience ( moſt Gracious Sovereign ) ſhould I dedicate theſe Compoſitions to any but Your Majesty ; they were born and nourished in Your Majeſties ſervice , and long ſince designed ( ſuch as they are ) and Offering to Your Royal hand . Many of them were composed by my Brother ( William Laws , ) whoſe life and endeavours were devoted to Your ſervice ; whereof , I ( who knew his heart ) am a ſurviving witness , and therein he perſiſted to that laſt minute , when he fell a willing Sacrifice for Your Majesty : I were unworthy ſuch a Brother , ſhould I tender ought that is his , or mine , to any but our Gracious Maſter ( from whoſe Royal Bounty both of us received all we enjoyed ; ) and ſuch and Inſcription would not only ſeem a Theft and Alienation of what is Your Majeſties , but ( which I moſt abhor ) would make me taſte of theſe ungrateful days . Your Majesty knows when the Regal Prophet firſt penned theſe Psalms , he gave them to the Musicians to be ſet to tunes ; and they humbly brought them to David the King . Beside , Mr. Sandys inſcribes his Tranſlation to Your Sacred Majesty ; ſo that this I offer is Your Majeſties in all capacities , and does not ſo properly come , as rebound back to Your Majesty . I was eaſily drawn to this preſumption , by Your Majeſties known particular affection to David's Psalms , both becauſe the Pſalter is held by all Divines one of the moſt excellent parts of holy Scripture ; as alſo in regard much of Your Majeſties preſent condition , is lively deſcribed by King David's pen . The King of Heaven and Earth reſtore Your Majesty according to Your own righteous heart , which is the daily earneſt prayer of Your Majeſties moſt humble , moſt loyally devoted Subject and Servant , HENRY LAWES .
