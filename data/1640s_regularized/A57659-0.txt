To the Right Worshipful Sir EDVVARD BANISTER . Sir , FOr two reasons this Book addr • sseth it self to you for patronage ; The one is , because you are aff • cted with this kind of learning , which hath the privilege above other Studies , that it is delightful and useful too : neither is there any Study that suits better with the disposition of a Gentleman , then ancient Poetry ; which , though it be accounted but and airy kind of learning by such as speak against it , either out of prejudice or ignorance ; yet in the balance of wise men's esteem these ancient Poets are not too light : But if these Censurers please to cast and impartial eye upon this Book , they will find , that there are no Books wherein so much learning is couched up in so little bounds , as in these old Poets , who were indeed the only learned men of their times : I could instance one , in whose rich cabinet are treasured up the jewels of all Learning fit for a Gentleman to know ; and that is Virgil by name , the king of Poets . The other reason of this Dedication to you is , to express my gratitude to your worth and goodness , and for your particular affection to use : I know the native beauty of your virtues needs not the adulterating art of rhetorical painting , therefore I will not use it , as being inconsistent with your modesty and my ingenuity : Only I desire that you will accept of this small present as a token of his love , who will always be found Sir , Your Worships servant to command , ALEXANDER ROSS .
