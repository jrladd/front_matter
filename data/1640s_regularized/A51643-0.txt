TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MY VERY GOOD LORD , HENRY Lord Marquess of DORCHESTER , Earl of KINGSTON , etc. And one of the Lords of His MAJESTIES most Honourable Privy Counsel . MY LORD , THe secret love of Hero and Leander first brought to light in the pure Greek of divine Musaeus , was afterwards new moulded in Latin by the fluent Ovid ; in imitation of whose Epistles , the most eminent Poets of all Climates have ( in their native languages ) written upon this subject so many Paraphrases and Essays , that like the numerous streams of Nile , they almost overflow the remembrance of their fountain . I confess the report of Poems borrowed from Musaeus made so great a noise , that to me the Author had been lost in the crowd of his Imitators , if I had not herd his soft lines sweetened by your Lordship's accent ; but then , I could not be satisfied till I made trial how the Greek would go in English : my intent being to translate and dedicate it privately to your Lordship . The Translation was forthwith dispatched , the Dedication is now presented , but the intended Privacy lay not in my power ; for my acquaintance ( who would know what I was doing ) had engaged me for so many Copies , that I held it my safest course , rather to venture upon the Printers pardonable errors , then to run the hazard of gross mistakes in ignorant Transcribers . Yet , as I could not make it altogether private , so I resolved it should not be altogether public , and have therefore suffered no more to be printed , then the just number promised ; which coming into friends hands , I cannot fear any rigid censure . But if some pretending Critic shall assault me , I shall smile to see him retire with double speed , beholding the name of the illustrious and learned person that privileges Your Lordship's most humble servant , ROBERT STAPYLTON .
