TO THE KINGS MOST SACRED MAIESTIE . Sir , AND Humbler Dedication , would seem to lessen the memory of that great Prince , whose History I here lay down at your feet . Your Majesty is heir to those Crowns , his happy courage regained from the long and violent possession , of a most Potent Family : What can then by any Title appertain to him , but must be injustice to offer to another ? His life presents your eye with rugged times , yet smoothed by a prevailing Fortune , and a just cause . Faction begotten many tempests : but Sovereignty found a happy calm , in the destruction ( since no gentler way had authority ) of mighty opposers . When we , your subject's , look back upon that age , how ought we to congratulate the present ? Wherein , free even from the noise of war , we have hitherto by the excellent Wisdom of your Majesties government , lived safe and envied . The Almighty grant all your people knowledge of their own felicity , and their minds so disposed , that their blessings may feel no interruption . May your Majesty long continue in peace , the comfort and honour of these times , and the best example for the future . But if you shall be forced to draw your sword ; may your enemies submit and tastpart of your mercy : if not ; perish in your Victories . This is the prayer of your Majesties Most Humble , most Loyal , and most Obedient Subject . WM . HABINGTON .
