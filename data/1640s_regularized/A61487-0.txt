SIR , YOur candid Interpretations of these conceits severally , hath animated me to a gleaning them up together ; and betrayed you to a Dedication , they say , Quae prosunt singula , multa juvant . Nor is it unusual , for men of my condition , in this nature , to repend the good nature of their munificent friends However , did my stars promise me any other requite , This trifling bark ( balanced with scarce any thing but sand and stones ) should to the fortune of the doubtful waves without a Palinure : in hope , either the shores would protect the shallow , or the deep drown it , out of sighed , and time , out of mind . I confess I can look upon it , no otherwise then a degree of impudence , to obtrude that upon your patronage which I my self have scarce confidence to own : Nevertheless , deign it your accept , since , though you find in it ( probably ) nothing good , you may yet assure your self of the good will , and good intents of him , that resolves to leave nothing unattempted , might any ways render him Sir , Your most grateful servant , M. STEVENSON .
