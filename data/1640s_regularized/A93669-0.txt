TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY MONARCH CHARLES by Divine providence King of Great Brittaine , France and Ireland , etc. YOur Highness may justly condemn this as a high preſumption , to preſent the moſt eminent King in the Chriſtian World with a diſcourſe of Petitions and Copies of Letters : but I have found favour in your sighed when I preſented them unto your highness upon more dangerous terms , and therefore I truſt that bleſſed Lord will move your heart ſtill to accept of the hearty deſires of your poor ſubject , though they be not clothed with the glorious ornaments of Wisdom and Eloquence , as was fit to dedicate to the view of ſo learned and judicious a Prince , but my comfort is , I speak to a merciful King , that knows how to pass by infirmities , and to pardon great offences : and ſo beſeeching the Lord God of heaven and earth to bless your Highness with many happy days , long to reign over us to hear the Petitions of your faithful Subject's , and to redress their wrongs , craving pardon for my boldness , I humbly take my leave . Devoted to your Highness Service , IOHN SPENCER .
