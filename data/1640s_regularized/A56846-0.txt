TO THE SACRED MAJESTY OF KING CHARLES , My most deer and dread Sovereign . SIR , BEpleased to cast a gracious eye upon this Book , and at Your leisure ( if Your Royal employments lend you any ) to peruse it . In Your Three Kingdoms , You have three sorts of people : The first , confident and faithful ; The second , diffident and fearful ; The third , indifferent and doubtful . The first are with You in their Persons , Purses , ( or desires ) and good wishes . The second are with You neither in their Purses , nor good wishes , nor ( with their desires ) in their Persons . The third are with You in their good wishes , but neither in their Persons , nor Purses , nor Desires . In this Book , these three sorts are represented in three Persons , and presented to the view of Your Sacred Majesty . You shall find them as busy with their Pens as the Armies are with their Pistols : How they behave themselves , let the People judge : I appeal to Cesar . Your Majesties honour , safety and prosperity , The Churches Truth , Unity , and Uniformity , Your Kingdoms Peace , Plenty and Felicity , is the continued object of his Devotion , who is SIR , Your Majesties Most Loyal Subject , The Replier .
