To my noble Friend and Gossip , Captain Richard Lovelace . Sir , I Have so long been in your debt , that I was almost desperate in my self of making you payment , till this fancy by ravishing from you a new Courtesy in its patrondge , promisedme it would satisfy part of my former engagements to you . Wonder not to see it invade you thus on the sudden : Gratitude is aerial , and like that Element â–ª nimble in its motion and performance ; though I would not have this of mine of a French disposition , to charge hotly and retreat unfortunately : there may appear something in this , that may maintain the field courageously against Envy , nay come off with honour ; if you , Sir , please to rest satisfied , that it marches under your Ensigns , which are the desires of Your true honourer Hen . Glapthorne .
