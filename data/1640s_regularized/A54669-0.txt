To the Right worthy as well by Virtue as Birth , the Lady Anne Glover . Madam , THough it be unlawful to offer up sacrifices to the dead , yet license me to sacrifice these Elegies to the memory of your Son , and permit me to make his name and Altar , though not his Tomb . Those reciprocal endearments which at first fed and fomented our friendship , have made such and impression on all those faculties that officiate to my Soul , on all those functions that hold Correspondence with Invention and Fancy , that I should not only seem ungrateful , appear unfruitful , but also supinely forgetful , if I should not endeavour by consecrating some Trophy ( though never so rude and inconsiderable ) to his remembrance , to redeem and rescue it from the Vault , and so preserve it , that it might never be raked up among his ashes . And though peradventure those benefits that he shed on others , fell but upon barren and unthankful ground , yet those he poured upon me , have not languished into oblivion , but teemed with a grateful acknowledgement : Death only by usurping his life too soon excluded me from enlarging my Gratitude to himself , that I might profess it to you , who shall be the Delegate to receive the payment of a Debt I owed to your Son , which shall be done with a Devotion as emphatical as that which excites me to send up my Orisons to Heaven for your happiness in this world , and before inspired me to pour forth my prayers for your Sons glory in the other . Madam , if you think that these low expressions of my zeal and Monuments of my Affection can improve your Sons memory to any perpetuity , suffer them I beseech you to give themselves up to your view , since you may ascertain your self that they issue from one whose entire study is , whose whole practice shall be , how he may declare himself , The humblest of your Servants Tho. Philipot .
