To the worthy ( and by me much Honoured ) Master IAMES METTAM Esquire , etc. SIR , BY that generous and noble Character , which long since I have herd conferred upon you , my sole ambition was to attend so happy and opportuninity as to be any way known unto you : But when time so far seconded my wishes , that upon and unexpected meeting I was made so fortunate , not only to be admitted into your company , but accepted into your knowledge , ( for which I stand much engaged to your kinsman and friend Mr. T. B. ) I instantly apprehended that report came much short of your worth and merit , which ( I ingenuously confess transcended my expectation ; ) for beside your generous affability and courtesy , ( the most graceful garnish , and best decorements that become and adorn a truebred Gentleman ) finding you not only generally addicted to the encouragement of all good Arts , and Sciences , but especially to the professors of Literature and Learning , and when upon further discourse I understood , that you more particularly had not only took view of some of my weak Labors , but crowned them with your Verdict : These inducements so far emboldened me , as to offer these my unpolished papers to your perusal and patronage , which if you shall be pleased to countenance ; I shall remain confident against all malicious prejudice : desiring rather to stand to the judicious censure of one truly rational , then to the ignorant Nonsense of a numerous rabble . Worthy Sir : compliment is a thing I have ever studied to avoid , and ( I presume ) you were never pleased to affect : then in a word , wishing you the accomplishment of all your noble desires , alternately corresponding to your worthy deserts , I commend you ( my generous Patron ) to the Almighty's gracious protection , ever remaining , Yours obsequiously devoted , T.
