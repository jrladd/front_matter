TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL The Lady Trevor , Wife to my moſt worthy and approved Friend , Sir Iohn Trevor . Madam , YOu have been long taught of God , and therefore are not ignorant that spiritual ſickneſſes differ many ways from bodily , this one is notable , The more any spiritual diſeaſe increases , the less it's felt , and the more any soul is ſenſible of it , the less power it hath over him ; This is found moſt true of the greateſt of spiritual plagues , the sin of hardness of heart , none more confident of the goodness of their heart , then the moſt obſtinate and rebellious ſinner , where as the moſt tender-hearted Chriſtian complains moſt of hardness , the ſpirit that is moſt flexible to God , moſt laments its obſtinacy ; Madam , I may apply this to your self , all ſuch ſervants of God who know and converſe with you can discern that God hath in great meaſure taken out of you the heart of ſtone and given you a heart of fleſh , upon the ta • les whereof he hath written his holy Law , and that it is your delight to walk with him , to live to him and pleaſe him in all things ; yet did I never hear you beſtow one good word upon your heart , but rather upon every occaſion you are declaiming againſt it , and complaining of its hardness and obſtinacy . But Madam to feel hardneſs of heart is ſoftneſs of heart , and did you but clearly underſtand how much the Lord delights in ſuch a frame of ſpirit as he hath given you , you would ceaſe to be ſo suspicious as you are of your own spiritual condition , and would ſpend the reſt of your days rejoicing in your portion and ſerving him without fear : I hope this plain Sermon may through Gods bleſſing be ſome help to make you judge more rightly of that grace which God hath ſo plentifully beſtowed on you , and to bless his Name who hath in great meaſure delivered you from this deſtroyer , even this plague of a hard heart ; I humbly preſent it unto you , as a pledge of my thankfulness , for all the many and great refreſhings I have found in your family , where I have conſtantly found your reſpect and tenderness towards me more like that of a mother then a ſtranger : The good Lord pardon my unfruitfulness among you , and requite you and your good husbands love towards me a thouſand fold into your bosoms , and multiply his favours upon your whole family , and continue to guide you by his counsel till you come to his glory . Your La. moſt obliged , STEPHEN MARSHALL .
