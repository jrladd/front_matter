To my worthily honoured Friend , Sir W. S. Knight . SIR , I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me , called the Popish Royal Favourite ; and according to your advice ( which I valve in a high degree ) I put pen to paper , and something you may see I have done ( though in a poor pamphleting way ) to clear my self of those aspersions that are cast upon me therein . But truly Sir , I was never so unfit for such a task ; all my Papers , Manuscripts , and Notes , having been long since seized upon and kept from me . Add hereunto , that beside this long pressure and languishment of twenty three Months close restraint ( the sense whereof , I find hath much stupified my spirits ) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sickness , a high burning fever , with the new disease , whereof my Body as well as my Mind is yet somewhat crazy : so that ( take all afflictions together ) I may truly say , I have passed the Ordeal , the fiery Trial . But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see better days I hope ; for out of this fatal black Cloud , which now oresets this poor Island , I hope there will break a glorious Sunshine of peace and firm happiness : To effect which , had I a Jury , a grand-Jury of lives , I would sacrifice them all , and triumph in the oblation . So I most affectionately kiss your hands , and rest Your faithful ( though afflicted ) Servant , Iames Howell . From the Prison of the Fleet.
