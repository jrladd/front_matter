TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM Marquess of Hartford , Lord Governor to the PRINCE His Highness . MY LORD : THe duty of affection which I bear to the memory of your Honourable Grandfather , the true Maecenas of my young Muses while he lived ; the knowledge which I have of your eminent worth , both for learning , religion , and courtesy , your good opinion and kind usage of me , still , when I had the happiness to see you , have emboldened me to grace the frontispice of this begun work , with your Honourable name , it is the fruit of some sequestered hours from my Divinity exercises , it hath lyen long neglected among my other papers , but by the importunity of some worthy friends , drawn out at last unto the light ; here may be seen what use can be made of poetical fictions : The spoils of Egyptians , and a Babylonish garment , may be serviceable for the Tabernacle . Accept this small present as a pledge and testimony of that duty and service which I owe to your self , and honourable Family , to whom I wish all increase of true happiness , which still shall be the prayer of Your Honours in all duty and service devoted , ALEXANDER ROSSE .
