To My Worthily much Honoured Cousin Sr. IOHN BAKER of Sissingherst in the County of Kent Baronet . SIR , I Cannot but very much honour you , as being a flourishing branch of that tree , of which I am but a withered bough ; and yet more , for the many excellent parts of piety and morality that are in you ; which as they are and ornament to your own person , so they make your person and ornament to all your Family ; whereof as a member I have resentment in a very great degree ; and therefore have dedicated this small tract to the Memory of your Name ; not so much to be a monument of your Virtues , which will always be a monument to themselves , as of the great Respect and Love I bear you , no less then owe you . I may justly call it a tract , seeing I have been drawn to write it , as it were by violence ; lest I should yield my self guilty of profane presumption , for writing in arguments of Divinity , being but a Lay man ; For there are some have censured it no less , and me no better ; but the best is , I need not their voices ; It is sufficient for me , that there is warrant enough in the Scriptures , for it ; allowance enough in the best writers , for it ; and testimony enough in the practice of all ages for it ; but most honoured Cousin , if notwithstanding all this , the cause shall happen to be a looser by my defending it ; I shall then entreat you , to accept it , withreflecting upon your own worth ; and if you find in it , nothing that is worth your reading ; at lest you shall find by it , his love and affection , who will ever be Your truly loving Cousin to ser â€¢ e and Honour you Richard Baker .
