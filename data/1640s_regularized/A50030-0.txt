THE EPISTLE DIRECTORY , TO M. G. M. IN GRACIOUS Street in London . DEare and loving friend , I received about tenne days agon your letter of the 9. of this present : wherein you demand and solicit again the thing , that I so flatly denied you , at my late being in your chamber : I mean to put in writing the relation which then I made unto you , of the speech had this last Christmas in my presence , between my right worshipful good friend and patron , and his guest the old Lawyer , of some matters in our state and country . And for that you â€¢ press me very seriously at this instant , both by request and many reasons , to yield to your desire herein , and not only this , but also to give my consent for the publishing of the same , by such secret means as you assure me you can there find out : I have thought good to confer the whole matter with the parties themselves , whom principally it concerns ( who at the receipt of your letter were not far from me : ) And albeit at the first I found them averse and nothing inclined to grant your demand : yet after upon consideration of your reasons , and assurance of secrecy ( especially for that there is nothing in the same contained , repugnant to charity or to our bounden duty towards our most gracious Princes or Country , but rather for the special good of them both , and for the forewarning of some dangers imminent to the same ) they have referred over the matter to me , yet with this Proviso , that they will know nothing , nor yet yield consent to the publishing hereof , for fear of some future flourish of the ragged Staff to come hereafter about their ears , if their names should break forth : which ( I trust ) you will provide , shall never happen , both for their security , and for your own . And with this I will end , assuring you that within these five or six days , you shall receive the whole in writing by another way and secret means , neither shall the bearer suspect what he carrieth : whereof also I thought good to premonish you . And this shall suffice for this time .
