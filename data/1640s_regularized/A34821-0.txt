To the truly worthy , and Worshipful , Mr. I S. of P. Esquire . Honoured Sir , IT is not the worthiness of the Work , nor Workman , can whisper any confidence of your acceptance of this trifle ; but only the seasonableness and truth of the subject ( of which you are more then and eyewitness ) gives it boldness to kiss your hand . This Poem was calculated only for the Meridian of some private friends , not daring to gaze in the face of the World , because it's near kin to truth , and therefore to danger . Nor did the Author desire so to strumpet his Muse , as to prostitute her to the embraces of every one , being not ambitious of the airy title of a Poet . Neither let it present it self to your eye the less worthy , because now martyred by the Press , though it be become now so adulterated with false and scandalous Pamphlets , that it is a dishonour for a legitimate fantasy to derive a title from thence . My humble request to your Worship is , that you will vouchsafe to enrich these lines with your view , and pardon the forward ambition of him , whose glory is to be known of you , at the becoming distance of Your Worships most humble Honourer , 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
