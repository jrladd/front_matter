To the right honourable Philip Herbert , Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery , Baron Herbert of Cardife , and Shirland , Lord Parre and Roos , of Kendal , Marmion , & Saint Quintine , Lord Warden of the Stanaties in the County of Devon , and Cornwall , Lord Lieutenant of Kent , Cornwall , Somerset , and Wiltes , Lord Chamberlain to his Majesty , Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter , Chancellor of the University of Oxford , and one of his Majesties most honourable privy Counsel . Great SIR , THe fancy of my Muse is forced to pause . If that your Honour do require the cause , It's this , I was not able to express In you , what is Great Britains happiness . I long was wooed to write your deserved praise , And by so doing , promised was the Baize , Which Caesars Virgil wore , but tender years To write that subject , filled my Muse with fears ; But yet again a Herberts name did move Me for to write , and in't express my love , Or rather duty , to your Honours fame , Who as yet did never deserve the least blame , Which envy would enforce ; Pardon I crave , That is the boon which I alone would have , From you ( great Sir . ) Alas I was too bold , For to write that , I do know you hold As nothing ; it is your sole desire To inflame England with a zealous fire . THOMAS HERBERT .
