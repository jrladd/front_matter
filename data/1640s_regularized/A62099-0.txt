TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE , AND TRULY LOYAL ARTHVR LORD CAPEL , Baron of HADDAM , my singular good Lord and Patron . My Lord , I Confess it might cause wonder that so weak , and worthless a creature as I am , should expose any thing to public view , did not the custom of the present time •• , plead a certain liberty of the Press , even for weakness it self . Three special reasons are usually given of div •• lging Sermons in this kind : First , to help and benefit Gods Church and people : Secondly , to manifest that inward respect , which the publishers owe to those Honourable or Worshipful persons to whom they are dedicated and presented . Thirdly , to vindicate the truth against the mistakes and traducements of ignorant or ill-affected hearers : and truly ( my Lord ) these are the reasons that have emboldened my weakness thus to discover it self , in thrusting these following Sermons from my private Cell . 1. I know that the wise God does sometime surther the greatest affairs of his Church , by the poor endeavours of his meanest servants ; and at this time , one of the great matters in hand , is to reform the Clergy , and to constitute such a Ministry , as should only seek the things of Jesus Christ ; and he that knows all hearts can witness , that mine aim when I preached the first of these , did tend to that thing , and I now conceived that ( with Gods providence and blessing ) the samemight ( haply ) at this present , afford some under service towards that so pious and necessary a work . And mine endeavours in the second of these were , by persuasions out of Gods book , to tie peoples tongues to their good behaviours , ( as I apprehended did become a Minister of Christ to do ) in those evil and barking days , and the conditions of many are still the same , they take and keep to themselves , I know not what strange liberty of bold speaking , whereby these unsettled times are likely to prove exceeding miserable ; for evil tongues as they discover evil men , so they do make evil times , and therefore I conceived that that Sermon also , if it come into some hands ( and God please to say Amen to my prayers with it ) may not altogether at this present prove unprofitable , or unseasonable And in third , mine aims were , when I first uttered it , to move my fellow-members and sufferers in the cause of Christ , to make use of that sovereign preservative of patience , which experience hath always found to be so truly effectual against the heavy blows of potent hands , and the smarting wounds of poisonous tongues : And I dare boldly say , that while sin and sorrow hath a being upon earth , it will never be improper to hear or read a discourse of that subject ; for we have all , at all times , yea , at this time , need of patience ; nay , I dare add further , that even your Lordship in the midst of your Honours , ( since you have resolved to follow only the dictate of Gods word , and conscience , in your walk , and way ) while men's tongues run at liberty , will have occasions sometime to think upon it . And in the last of these , I have ( though briefly ) handled a matter , most needful also ( I am sure ) for this present age to be acquainted with : it is the right temper and nature of the spirit of the Gospel : I preached of it only to mine own Parish , but I pray for the enlargement of it in all places , and I know your Honour and all others , that have religious and loyal hearts , truly aiming at the Gospels glory , and the Kingdoms peace , do in like sort desire the same : to the end therefore that I might be a mean to awaken others more able , of my profession , to make more ample discoveries of it , as their duty to God , and their Prince commands , and these times require , I have been here bold to publish my notes upon that subject also : And this ( my Lord ) is my first reason . 2. My second is , to manifest by this occasion to the world's eye , that true inward respect , which I acknowledge of long time , to have duly owed unto your Lordship ; your Noble Grandfather of pious memory , being quickened by your most friendly solicitation , did freely bestow upon m • , that place of maintenance , wherein ( as yet ) I have my dwelling , upon this sole condition and charge , that I should truly labour to win souls to Christ : which godly care of his , as it spoke him a true friend of Christ , so it may expose him for a pattern to all Patrons , and your Lordship herein is his true successor : so that if these my first fruits of this nature , were of any worth , I am bound by a double tie to Dedicate them only to your self , as to mine ancient Noble friend , as to my present Honourable Patron . But ( my Lord ) there is yet another reason that does challenge this duty from me of manifesting my self unto the world to be your servant , and that is this , When I was questioned , and much menaced for the first of these Sermons , and did upon that occasion ( to the end you might not be mistaken in the cause of my troubles ) present a copy of it to your view : you were pleased upon the reading thereof , to proffer your self like a true Patron , to be my defender in that business ; and you would also make use of all the friends you had in England , ( that was your own expression ) in my behalf , rather then I for that matter should suffer damage . Truly ( my Lord ) the consideration of that your Nobleness , in being so freely ready to engage your self in the cause of Christ , for me so m • ane a person , the times being then so conflicting , hath more deeply captivated my heart to your Lordship's service , then my hand or tongue is able to express : yea , should some crafty Zibaes ( unhappily ) so far prevail ( as I hope they never shall ) against your poor Mephibosheth , as to move my Lord , in aftertimes , to think amiss of his servant , and as David did , to judge him unworthy of former favour , yet I would have all men know , that of necessity I am bound , and therefore must , and shall , from the remembrance of that your goodness , for ever honour you . And ( my Lord ) whither now should that poor wounded Sermon retire her self , at this her second and more public appearance ? whither should she fly for shelter ? but only to that wing which did not disdain of its own accord , at her first flight , to open it self unto her in the midst of dangers : And behold ( my Lord ) she comes unto you , and your free bounty hath made her bold , to bring three of her sisters with her , who have all in their measure tasted of her sorrows , and desire now to partake of that rest , which she begs to enjoy under your shade , your protection is large enough to defend them all foure , wherefore be pleased my Honourable Lord to give them all leave together with their Author to boast themselves still and for ever , in your Noble Pat • onage . 3. And my last reason of publishing these Sermons , was and is , to rectify ( if it may be ) those misapprehensions , which some hearers had of certain passages in them , and still have of me for the same : I do not intend to Apologise for my self , I am a man , and may transgress , and do so daily against my will , ( the Lord be merciful unto his servant ; ) And I know beside , that it is tedious even to good men sometime , to hear wronged innocence begin to speak in her own behalf , when themselves have had a hand in afflicting of her , as appears by Davids words to Mephibosheth , 2 Sam , 19. 29. Why speakest thou any more of thine own matters ? but the Lord commands us to endeavour the reformation of those that err , and therefore for the sake of such as did not at first rightly hear what J spoke , J have now so spoken as they may see : Seneca says , that people do give better credit to their eyes then to their ears , and therefore here is Audibile turned to Visibile , what was transient , is become more constant , that ( if they please ) they may consider by seeing , whither they did not before mistake in hearing . I hope in your Lordship's judgement , and equal eye may herein discern such and impartial spirit , as becomes a Minister of Christ to exercise in the discharge of his office : I bless the Lord for it , I can say ( with Elihu Iob 32. 21 , 22. in Iob ) J know not how to give slattering titles , J know not how to accept any men person in speaking for God , or from him : He that will seek to please Christ , must not seek to please men , and he that will shoot at both extreanes , must look to be shot at by both them : but peace at the last , will make amends for all , that crown of righteousness which God the 2 Tim. 4. 7 , 8. righteous Judge shall give to him , that from the testimony of a good conscience can say at his death , I have fought a good fight , I have kept the faith , will more then recompense all sorrows . And ( my Lord ) although I will not attribute to your Hono • r Gods due , who alone does frame and govern spirits , yet this I must truly confess , that your Lordship's judgement , and the temper of your spirit , • ath afforded much support and encouragement to mine , in that even , upright , and hated way : your constant dislike of the too much formality , and superstitious incroachments of late times , did secretly animate my heart against that extreme , and strengthen me under the pressures of it ; And your fearful tenderness of walking in men's crypticke ways , of setting your foot among painted Sepulchers , hath on the other side given me much boldness in the discovering & opening them , and hath been as a special Antidote to preserve me from being over-daunted with the damp and paysonous infection which from thence hath summed out upon me . Thus ( my Lord ) it pleases God to make the goodness of great persons ( sometime perhaps unwitting to themselves ) to be as life and cordials to his Ministers . I know your Lordship had rather be , then seem religious ; to do good in secret , and then forget it , was your custom long ago ; I remember oh • tO the times past , ( being a servant in your Grandfathers family , and and under Minister in that Parish ) when I knew of any in want or misery , that were sick , or lacked bred , for them and theirs , and did but go in secret and tell you , the least intimation stirred your bowels , you appeared to my thoughts , a • glad of and occasion to show your pity and bounty , as those afflicted were , in tasting of it ; which was to me the language , not only of a generous , but also of a gracious spirit , for such kind of crypticke ways does God allow , herein his hidden ones delight to walk : And let the blessing of that God ever attend your Honour in them , and let the blessing of him that was ready to perish come upon you daily , Job 29. 13. let your goodness always outshine your greatness , for the comfort and encouragement of Gods servants , let sincerity and loyalty still remain your constant supporters , let them make you exemplary to all men here , and fit you fully at length , to wear the Robe and Diadem of perfect honour ; so prayeth Your Honours most humble and faithful servant EDVVARD SYMONDS .
