To the right Honourable Algernon Percie , Earl of Northumberland , etc. MY LORD , SO many glorious titles crown Your Noble Stem , as easily they put down Great Romes Aemilians , Scipio's , Fabio's , whose One single Tribe adventured to oppose Themselves their Cities Wall : and with their blood , Preserve Room from the innumerous Multitude Of Veia â€¢ s , How oft have our Ancestors Seen , and extolled like Piety of Yours ? How many Victories have the PERCIES god ? What Trophies reared of the subdued SCOT ? How many of your Martial Lineage are In FAMES BOOK , written Thunderbolts of VVAR . Who with HEROIC Actions add new Grace , To Charlemain's MARTELLVS , PEPINS raze , From whom you are discendants ; and we know How much GRADIVUS and the MVSES owe To your Progenitors : and dare rehearse Our better VOVVES and SERVICES in verse . Be Greatest FABIVS , be great ALGERNON , And emulate your PERCIES CRESCENT MOON Shewre down your influence : make our clouded night By your wise Counsels , then the day more bright . Your Honours humble Servant , A , RIVERS ,
