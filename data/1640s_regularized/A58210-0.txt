To the Reverend & Right Worshipful Sir Thomas Mallet Knight , one of the Justices of the Kings Bench , and Judge of Assize in the County of Kent . And also to the Honourable Sir Edward Deering , of Surenden Dering in Kent , Knight and Baronet , one of the Knights of the shire for Kent : health and happiness eternal in Christ Iesus . Right Honourable , THe reason why I adventure this Sermon to the public view , is because I understand , it was , in the delivery , mistaken by some hearers , whose second thoughts , I am confident , upon their better scanning it , will be more charitable : my whole scope being to persuade to and holy unity in Christ , which every son of peace wishes with me â–ª Our present necessity may satisfy a considering man , why I put it under the Sanctuary of both your names , one being our Judge and interpreter of the Laws , and the other one of the lawmakers in the most honourable high court of Parliament : seeing we now want both good laws , & right interpretation of the same , for the suppressing the disturbers of the Churches peace , and for the settling of and happy unity : to which I only add the hearty prayers for the good success of your prudent endeavours and the humble tender of the love and service of The least of Christs Ministers Io.
