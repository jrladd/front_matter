To the Right honourable , ROBERT Earl of Effex , Viscount Hereford , and Bouchier , Lord Ferrers of Chartley , Bouchier , and Lovaine . RIGHT HONOURABLE , I Could hardly compose my thoughts , touching the presentation of these my unworthy endeavours , to one so worthy , and truly noble as your Lordship , having no excuse but your goodness , and the encouragement of those who are truly honorers of your virtues : Among which number I desire to be known . I have nothing to plead for my Muse , but that the Subject with the Title , do agree : And that the fruit she bears , is wholesome , though sour . That which falls with shaking , is not worth taking up . I know I shall undergo the censure of some , that can Judge of nothing but what they see ; having narrow spirits , only room for sense at the worst . In respect of such , my Muse was safer walking by Night ; than now by Day . But if it shall please your Lordship to support her with your hand , and look upon that little good which may appear through a multiplying glass , and extenuate the weakness , Envy her self will keep at a distance ; and she shall pass with freedom , gaining commendations from your Honours Approbation . She's so far adorned with modesty among her Opposites , that she will not bespeak a glance from your eye , but when you be retired from more weighty occasions . If I should write but what highborn Fame speaks of your worth , and call your noble Virtues by their names , I should make the entrance so pleasing-large , that the Reader would there take up his rest . But it shall be satisfaction to me , that she's graced with your name : which will preserve her from living graves . And with my prayers to the God of Truth , for your Lordship's eternal hapinesse , I shall rest your most engaged and humble servant , HUMPHRY MILL .
