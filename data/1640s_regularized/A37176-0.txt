K. JAMES OUR LATE MOST learned Sovereign , in the Epistle of Is. CASAUBON to Cardinal PERRON , upon the 3d Observation . THe King thinketh that the number of things absolutely necessary to salvation is not great . Wherefore his Majesty is of opinion that there is no readier way to a general accord , than diligently to sever necessary points from unnecessary ; and so that there be a consent in the necessary articles , in the other unnecessary place may be given to Christian Liberty . The King judgeth those Points simply necessary , which are either expressly in the word of God commanded to be believed or done , or collected out of the word by the ancient Church , by immediate consequence . If this distinction were well applied to the deciding of Controversies at this day , and divine Laws fairly severed from positive or Ecclesiastical Constitutions , it is very likely that godly and moderate men would not long be at any variance in things absolutely necessary . For they are but few , as we said before ; and they are already almost agreed upon among all that call themselves Christians . And further , his Majesty does so approve of the former distinction , and esteems it to be of such moment for the lessening and settling of Controversies ( which at this day so much vex the Church of Christ , ) that in his judgement it is the duty of all godly men that love truth and peace most diligently to teach , press , and urge it .
