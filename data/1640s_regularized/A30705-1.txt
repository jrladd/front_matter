TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the LORDS and others of His MAIESTIES moſt Honourable Privy Council . ACcording to Your Honours command we have inquired and conſidered how the Mines-Royall were left to Maſter Bushel by the Lady Middleton , and do in all humility declare , that the ſilver mines were not worth the working , until Maſter Bushel at his great charge diſcovered Rich Over in the adjacent mountains , which in all likelihood will both increaſe the Bullion & by his way of working , in ſhort time give his Majeſty a true trial what the invaluable riches of theſe His Welſh mountains are : for whereas the Mines in theſe parts were formerly wrought by Pumps , and ſo growing deep were left drowned with water , M. Bushel cuts through the main Rocks , at the loweſt level , to and hundred fathom perpendicular , according to the Germane manner of working , which though chargeable , yet certain , having foure several Addits which he continueth driving day and night into foure several mountains , his induſtry alſo hath outstripped former times , for by melting the poor fuſible Over , with the Rich , he produceth a third part more of ſilver with the ſame charge : and for accommodating the works with all materials fit for Mines Royal , he hath ſpared no coſt about repairing the mills , hath alſo built in his Majeſties Caſtle of Aberyſtwith a fair mint , hath contracted with merchant's of our own and other Nations to ſupply the peoples neceſſity with Corn and other proviſions , and payeth the miners and carriers at the Scales , and doubteth not to make them able Pioneers , and fit soldiers to do His Majeſty and their Country ſervice upon any aſſault of and enemy . All which we commend to Your Honourable conſideration , praying , etc. Your Lordship's humbly to be commanded , Joſeph Hexſteter , chief Steward of the Mines . Samuel Reyniſh , Aſſay Master's of the Mint . Water Barkesby , Aſſay Master's of the Mint . Humphrey Owen , Clarke of the Mines .
