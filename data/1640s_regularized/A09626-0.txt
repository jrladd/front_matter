TO THE WORSHIPFUL His much esteemed good Friend , Mr. RICHARD PELHAM , Esquire , S. P. Wishes all happiness and prosperity here and hereafter . WORTHY SIR , IT may seem something strange , that so mean a Muse as mine , upon so unworthy a Subject as this , should so rudely dare to shelter it self under the protection of your Name , or intrude upon the consure of so solid a judgement as resides in your breast ; considering how conversant you daily are with raptures both of a higher strain and better nature , daily proffered to your view and censure : But the persuasion of your courteous acceptation of such wild Olives as these are ( as of Plants which inoculated and pruned , in time may produce more mature and delicious fruits unto her fosterers ) hath emboldened me to it ; and shall therefore ( I hope ) be the better excused ( though it want much of what I wish it had ) because it flies to you as a Refuge , under whose Hands it hath both security and warrant . Expect no quaint language nor fragrant Flowers of flowing Rhetoric , but such as use to proceed from springing youth , they are the wanton fruits of idle hours , and so happily cannot yield that relish that may be expected from them But yet your ingenuity and generous disposition assures the acceptation being the first fruits of my Muses springing . ) And that you cherish them , that they die not in their Bud , but ( by your promptitude ) may be preferred from the blast of envy , and the rot of time and oblivion . The persuasion of your liberal acceptation vouchsafed me , not only imps my Muses wings for a higher flight in the future , but vows me to acknowledge my self now and ever Your Worships most obsequiously to be commanded , SAMUEL PICK .
