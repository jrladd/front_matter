To the thrice Excellent and Illustrious Charles , Prince of Wales , his Highness . Most Noble Prince , THough the present patterns of your Royal Parents and lasting Monuments of your famous Ancestors , remaining in Memory to all Posterity may fully and lively de ••• in • e , and daily instructions of your grave and learned Teachers and Governors , may most amply express the Portraiture of a true perfect and complete Christian ; whereof the one may be said to inform , the other to enforce you to the imitation of their Heroical virtues and graces in the Profession of Christianity , the one guiding you by rule , the other by example , that it may seem nothing wanting to make you abound in such heavenly knowledge and Divine Philosophy ; yet since Nunquam nimu discitur quod nunquam satis discitur , and no word is to be accounted out of time that may be spoken profitably , whereby and so accounted of the wiseman as apples of gold in silver or transparent dishes , and more especially since the subject of this discourse and Bafis whereon this Complete Christian stands and is founded , so properly pertaineth as by the Laws appropriated to those of the younger sort , and your Highness the head of the Infantry . On whom the eyes of all those Minims of Nobility , and other the younger plants , of this flourishing Kingdom are fixed , and ready to admire your Princely expression : and express the imitation of you in their actium . Let it not seem strange that I thus present this to you , so properly to the younger sort , and Primarily to your self belonging as Prince of the Youth , and Prime Mirror of all those younger Plants . The next Ages hope the story and glory of succeeding times , or stay and prop of the flourishing of this famous Kingdom ; many things and of mean worth are usually and frequently I know offered unto your Highness , and you have been pleased to accept of so mean dedication , as of Grammar and other the inferior sciences : how much more to cast a favourable aspect hitherward : and to dayne your Graces acceptance of this Treatise of so high and heavenly a Nature as holy Divinity , the Queen and Mistress of all other Arts and Sciences , bringing with her , and bestowing on her followers , such ornaments as best suit , from the meanest to the Mightiest , to all the Professors of true Christianity : As this Treatise also may serve , if need were , to make not only a Complemental , but a Complete Christian , and afford to all ( as we ought to desire the good of all ) profit or contentment , profit to the meanest who may learn by it , contentment to those of riper Maturity who can best judge of it , if many of ablest judgement , and Master's in their Profession be not deceived — Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci . What the Author faileth of this and of the general good , he faileth of his best vote , who heartily desires the spiritual and best good of all . Such as it is , it lies prostrate with the Author himself at your Highness feet , only begging such your gracious favour , as good deservings or best desires do usually find and obraine at your Princely hands . So tendering his Orisons , at the Throne of Grace , for the abundant store of all heavenly and earthly blessings , for the continual increase of your happiness , as your increase in days , to Crown and attend you . The due and daily prayers of a faithful and sworn Servant in that your Royal family , sometime Chaplain to your worthy and Illustrious Grand Mother of blessed Memory , and no less for many other respects , in all dutiful observance to your Highness , Most Humbly Devoted Ever , William Slatyer .
