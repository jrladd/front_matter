To the most Illustrious and most hopeful PRINCE CHARLES , Prince of WALES . SIR , While I had the honour to serve your Highness , I did it ( how weakly soever ) with that fidelity and dutiful affection to your Person , which found your gracious acceptance , together with some encouragement from your own mouth to hope a new and more sixt relation to you in the future ; the only suit I was bold to make : as having ever esteemed that to serve your Highness , would of it self be and abundant reward for having served you . In the mean time I hold my self bound to pay your Highness some tribute of my hours of vacancy , presenting to your Princely view for the present this Italian Pastoral , into which the no less wise then witty Guarini ( having grown unprofitably gray in Travel , Universities , and Courts , as out of the fifth Act , where he personates himself under the name of old Carino , may be collected ) infused whatsoever of excellent so eminent Schools could teach so apt a Scholar . His scope therein being , to make a Dernier effort ( as the French call it ) or general muster of the whole forces of his Wit before his Princely Master ( the then Duke of Savoy ) and withal to insinuate and bring into that awful presence , in their masking clothes ( as I may say ) such principles of Virtue , and knowledge Moral , Political , and Theologicall , as ( peradventure ) in their own grave habits , out of the mouths of severer Instructors , would not have found so easy admittance to a Prince in the heat of his youth , heightened with the pomp and flatteries that attend on Greatness , and with the glorious triumphs and felicities of his royal Nuptials then celebrating : though this was the same Charles Emanuel who proved afterwards in his riper years , by his Counsels and by his Prowess , the Bulwark indeed of Italie , against the puissance of the great Henry of France himself , your Highness most renowned Grandfather . Your Highness may have seen at Paris a Picture ( it is in the Cabinet of the great Chancellor there ) so admirably designed , that , presenting to the common beholders a multitude of little faces ( the famous Ancestors of that Noble man ) ; at the same time , to him that looks through a Perspective ( kept there for that purpose ) there appears only a single portrait in great of the Chancellor himself ; the Painter thereby intimating , that in him alone are contracted the Virtues of all his Progenitors ; or perchance by a more subtle Philosophy demonstrating , how the Body Politic is composed of many natural ones ; and how each of these , entire in it self , and consisting of head , eyes , hands , and the like , is a head , and eye , or a hand in the other : as also , that men's Privates cannot be preserved , if the Public be destroyed , no more then those little Pictures could remain in being , if the great one were defaced : which great one likewise was first and chiefest in the Painters design , and that for which all the rest were made . Just so our Author ( exposing to ordinary view and Interlude of Shepherd's , their loves , and other little concernments , with the stroke of a lighter pencil ) presents through the perspective of the Chorus , another and more suitable object to his Royal Spectators . He shows to them the image of a gasping State ( once the most flourishing in the world ) : A wild Boar ( the sword ) depopulating the Country : the Pestilence unpeopling the Towns : their gods themselves in the merciless humane Sacrifices exacting bloody contribution from both : and the Priests ( a third Estate of misery ) bearing the burden of all in the Chorus , where they deplore their own and the common Calamity . Yet in the Catastrophe , the Boar slave ; the Pestilence ( but this was before upon that miserable composition with their Gods ) ceased ; the Priests above all others exulting with pious joy : and all this miraculous change occasioned by the presaged Nuptials of two of Divine ( that is , Royal ) extraction ; meaning those at that time of the Duke of Savoy with the Infanta of Spain , from which fortunate Conjunction he prophecies a final perjod to the troubles that had formerly distracted that State : So much depends upon the Marriages of Princes . I am not ignorant ( Sir ) that this famous Dramatic Poem must have lost much of the life and quickness by being poured out of one vessel ( that is , one Language ) into another , beside what difference may be in the capacity and mettle of the Vessels themselves ( the Italian being transcendently both copious and harmonious ) , and beside the unsteadiness of the hand that powers it ; And that a Translation at the best is but the mock-Rainbow in the clouds , faintly imitating the true one : into which Apoll • himself had a full and immediate influence . Yet because it seems to me ( beholding it at the best light ) a Lantskip of these Kingdoms , ( your Royal Patrimony ) a • well in the former flourishing , as the present distraction • thereof , I thought it not improper for your Princely notion at this time , thereby to occasion your Highness , even in you • recreations , to reflect upon the sad Original , not without hope to see it yet speedily made a perfect parallel throughout ; and also your self a great Instrument of it . Whither by some happy Royal Marriage ( as in this Pastoral , and the case of Savoy , to which it alludes ) thereby uniting a miserably divided people in a public joy ; oh • by such other ways and means as it may have pleased that • Divine Providence to ordain for and end of our woe ; I leave to that Providence to determine .
