TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL , AND WORTHY HONOURED KNIGHT , Sr. PAVL PINDER . Noble Sir , the Renown of your Illustrious Virtues in Foreign Nations , by exemplary Piety at home , hath been so apparent to me , though a stranger to my Native Country , that I have presumed to present your Worship with his Treatise , •• jessing my ardent affection for the enlargement of the Multitude of my poor Countrymen , groaning under the merciless yoke of Turkish thraldom ; and the rather my self having there suffered , loss of my estate , and the misery of 7. years slavery in chains , and in the Galleys of Argeire , its not unknown to your Worship , having been Resident in those parts , what their sufferings are , as scoffs , threats , blows , chains , hunger , nakedness , with innumerable others , and which is most deplorable , their danger of falling from the Christian and most holy faith , of which sort . I have known many who through the extremity of their sufferings hath renounced their Saviour , and embraced the Mahomitan and diabolical Imposture , these misery's and innumerable others , having been presented to my eyes , though now by the mercy of God , happily escaped , do still increase my zeal for their liberties , which your worship being and eminent personage in this flourishing Kingdom , may be a worthy instrument to accomplish ; I fear to be too presumptuous in craving your worships Patronage to this impolite discourse , and therefore humbly beseech your Worships pardon , and implore the Divine Majesty to conserve your person and honour , in making them long and happy in earth , and in fine to reward you with Eternal happiness , Thus prays he that is your Worships most humble Suppliant FRANCIS KNIGHT .
