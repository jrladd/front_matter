TO His most Sacred MAJESTY . SIR , While I contemplate Your Sufferings , see You ( as it were ) personating to the life that sadK . James his Pattern of a Kings Inauguration . Pattern , which from the Archetype of Royal Patience ( the King of Heaven himself , ) the Pen of Your Great Father drew , behold You though under all the Pressures of these times , yet still above them , and see even those Crosses intended for Your Afflictions , stoop , and bow to You , paying You , ( as it were ) that Homage which Your people should , and in acknowledgement of Your new Acquest of passive Glory ( a Glory , which till Your Majesties sufferings manifested the contrary , was held inconsistent with that of a Crown ) saluting You with the sad , yet sacred Title of the King of Sorrows ; I from thence assume the humble boldness to think that this Piece of Seneca of The Sufferings of Good Men , might at this time be made a pardonable , ( I durst not think it a suitable ) Present for Your Majesties view ; wherein as by a weak Reflex , Your Majesty may perceive a glimpse of Your own invincible Patience , and inimitable Magnamity ; in in bearing and ever-mastering Misfortunes . How far beyond what now it hath , had the Divine Pencil of Seneca set off this dark-shadowed Tablet , had he lived in these Times to have heightened it with the lustre of Your Majesties Example ! Sir , while the times are such , that they deny me according to my particular Duty to serve the just Commands of Your Majesties Will , I presume ( though by so mean a Demonstration ) to show Your Majesty that yet I have a Will to serve You. And if Your Majesty shall be pleased to pardon this humble Address , it shall abundantly satisfy his Modesty who cherishes not in himself so proud a Hope as to look for and Acceptation . God who regards Your Majesties Sufferings , for these Minutes of Afflictions , send You Eternity of Joys , and Crown You with Glory on a Heavenly Throne ; which that he would be pleased ( as in a Type ) to shadow forth unto You in the Happiness of a speedy and a glorious Restauration to This of Your Majesties Kingdoms ; Is the truly zealous , and the justly-bounden Prayer of Your Majesties most Loyal Subject and Servant , EDW . SHERBURNE .
