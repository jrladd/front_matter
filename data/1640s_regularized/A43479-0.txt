TO THE JLLUSTRIOUS WILLIAM . By the grace of God , born Prince of Orange , Earl of Nassau etc. Marquis of Veer and Vlissing etc. Baron of Breda . AND Lord General of the Cavallrie , in the service of the high , and mighty Lords , the STATES GENERAEL of the United Provinces . JLLVSTRIOVS AND NOBLE PRINCE , AMong the many Arts professed in the World , the Art Military practised in our modern Wars of these United Provinces , ( the Nursery of the Milita ) ought not to be accounted the least : for what magnanimous , brave vailliant Generals , Chieftains , Commandours & Soldiers of all nations have been bred , and brought up in this Academia , and Seed belli is sufficiently known to the World , and what honourable Actions , and memorable services they have done and performed , returning victorious out of the Field , I leave to the testimony of History . Especially , the Almighty God , the Lord of Hosts hath so blessed your generous House , as namely , your grandfather Prince William , your uncle Prince Maurice , both of immortal memory , and now your victorious Father , Prince Fredrick Henry our Captain General , as instruments for the defence of his afflicted Church , the true protestant Religion , & for the maintenance of the Privileges , & freedoms of the Land & hath crowned them with and never-dying name , against the violence plots and subtle machinations of one of the mightiest Potentates of all Christendome . What glorious actions the Almighty God hath wrought by them , for the deliverance of his Church and people in this Land the Historiographers of our times strive as with Trumpets to found forth their fame . For if we cast our eyes backward to times past , & the beginnings of our Wars , when this State consisted but in a handful of people , and a few Towns and were in great distress , and compare it with the State of the Land as it is now , we must acknowledge how wonderfully God hath blessed , and protected these Countries against all the Tyranny , and treachery of the Duke of Alva , the Bishop Granvelle , and diverse other Spanish Governors , & that he by his out stretched Arm , hath extenpsed the Limits , & bounds of these United Provinces , even ( as it were ) from the Sunrising , to the Sun setting , and what hath all the Peruvian Gold , and the Topazan Silver availed them , we may therefore truly say with the Apostle , If God be with us , who can be against us Again , if we consider what God hath done for this Land of later years , it is a wonder in our eyes how remarkably & with what good success he hath blessed the able Conduct , and designs of his highness your Father : for in the beginning of his Generallship did he not take in Groll , & Oldenzeel , and that heaven-blessed Surprisal of Wesel , even when the Enemy was entered almost into the bowels of this Country & just at that time , when his highness was engaged so deeply at the Siege of the Bosch , and carried that invincible town , against the expectation of all men ? The year after Rhyenbergh , and then became master of the strong town of Mastricht , & took it before the noses of two great armies , which lay between us and home , then his and your own city of Breda , within seauen weeks & a day , after we put spade into the Earth , and brake ground towards it , whereas Marquis Spinola lay almost a whole year before it . And last of all the strong Castle & House of Gennep , which did so much annoy these Countries ; These victories and Lawrils I have briefly related , to refresh your highness memory withal , & to the end , that we may give the glory and praise unto God for them . As for my self , J have seen these things , & have served this Land two and fortie years , and learned some experience in these Wars , which made me take penn in hand , to writ the Principles of the Art Military , practised in these Wars , first under the Conduct of your Uncle Prince Maurice of blessed memory , as now also under your victorious Father for the instruction of such English Gentlemen , & Soldiers , who are willing to come into the States service , & for the informing of their Judgments the better , & with a great deal of labour , charge , and pains have represented this noble art by the way of Figure , the word of Command and demonstration , & having once shown one of my three parts to his highness your Father , it pleased him in your presence to give me encouragement , to turn my English books into Netherdutch . In obedience whereof , I translated my first part for the exercising of a foot Company , and a troop of Horse ( and God willing intend to do the other two parts in time ) & dedicated it to your highness , And now the wars of my native Country and Jreland which the Almighty compose , calling for them again , as I dedicated my first part unto your highness in Dutch : so now I most humbly beseech your highness , that under your gracious acceptance and patronage this second Edition may come again to the view of the World in my maternal tongue , both in these Countries and in England , and I shall bound not only to pray unto God for you & her highness Royal your dearest consort to bless you being our future Hope's next under God hereafter , and a sprig sprung from that noble house of Nassaw , to give you the like success and victory over our Enemies as he hath done to your predecessors : but also to crown you , and her highness Royal with everlasting felicity hereafter resting . Your highnesses humble and submissive servant , HENRY HEXHAM .
