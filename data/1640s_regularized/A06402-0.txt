TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL , MY Most honoured Cousin , Thomas Lower Esquire , humbly ; Health and Happiness . Sir , IT was once disputed within me , whither to give this poor Phoenix birth or burial , whither to commit her to the fire , and suppress her in her ashes , or let her ascend again in her own nature and live ; there was only one reason to persuade the former , and that was your favourable and courteous approbation , diverse considerations to urge the later , but the chiefest of all her imperfections . I have adventured notwithstanding by virtue of your patronage , to expose her to the public view and censure of the world , no longer now behaving my self as I have scene a timorous young soldier at his first entrance i'th' war , duck down the head at every shot of the enemy , but rather as a bold and experienced Martialist under your Colours , run resolutely on up to the Canons mouth of the most carping and most malicious Critic whatsoever , needing no other fortification then your protection , which is a sufficient guard and defence against their strongest invasion . Cherish this innocent bird that flies into your bosom for sanctuary , respect her for her rarity , though she can plead no other merit , and in lieu of such noble favour , she hath vowed ( when she expires ) to make her self in her flames your sacrifice , as I Your servant , WILLIAM LOWER .
