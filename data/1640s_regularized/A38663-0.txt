To my much respected Friend , ANTHONY NICOLL , Esquire . SIR , THe cause of our lying still to day was , that the Clothes and Arms might be disposed , but principally , that Col : Harvey might not be too far engaged , who is marching after with the Associated Forces , and I hope , will be near us to morrow night ; and then I doubt not , but we shall march without stop or stay . By the enclosed , you'll see what I hear from Warwick . Your assured Friend , ESSEX .
