TO THE TRULY Noble the Lady , Theophila Cook . MADAM , IF I had no obligation to your Ladyship , which might challenge my endeavours of honouring you , a fitter or a happier name could not protect this piece , ( whoſe ſubject is the preferring of Duty , and reſpects before Love , as the former did Honour and courage : ) which I therefore offer to your Ladyship ; becauſe in them there is none better ſtudied than your self , in whom I have observed from the ſtrength of Virtue , ſuch a ſerenity as conducts your mind to the performance of whatſoever is fit and decent in humane life . And I remember I had the Honour to hear your Ladyship diſcourſe of this ſubject , when you concluded that a perfect Lover ſhould ſubmit his deſires to his Mistress's advancement : which made me wiſh that our French Author had ſpoken with thoſe Graces here in this , with which your Ladyship then did . But ſince it pleaſed his Majeſty to think it worth the tranſlating , and commanded it to be put into my hands , I will not cenſure it , though I believe , if that may carry the place which is free from deformities , without excellence before that which is here and there exceeding fair , and as much blemiſhed , I think this may deſerve it , which is rather not to be excepted to then much extolled . Whatſoever it be , I beſeech your Ladyship to let it pass under your name , leſt I be thought indiſcreet in placing it elsewhere , or unmindful of what I owe you , though this be the leaſt part of that return which is meant to you from Your moſt humble and obedient Servant , ERUTTER .
