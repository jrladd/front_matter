TO ALL THE SONNES OF PEACE In the Church of ENGLAND , Eſpecially thoſe in the Town of Great Yarmouth , Grace and Peace . WHen I entered upon the ſeventh Verſe of this Chapter , ( for there I first brake ground ) I cannot ſay , that it was my purpoſe to have followed the Baptiſt to the end of his Sermon . But Providence leading me along , it hath now brought me to the Borders , the middle clauſe of the l •• Verſe of it ▪ Which when I fell in hand with , I can ſay , that it was far from my thoughts to make my Meditations thereon any further public , then as the Pulpit rendered them . But finding the Subject ſeaſonable for the times , I have been induced to comply with the deſires of ſome ▪ and approbations of others , in ſending them abroad , as Noah once did his Dove out of the Ark , when the Earth was covered with waters . What entertainment they ſhall meet with , or what return they will make , as I know not , ſo neither am I overthoughtfull . It is enough for me , that I have endeavoured herein to pleaſe God and not men , otherwiſe then in him , and for him . My deſires ( I confess ) have been , and are , that this my ſervice , ( if poſsible ) might be acceptable to all . However , being a Service for Ieruſalem ▪ I doubt not but it ſhall be ſo to you , and all thoſe who pray for the peace thereof ; whoſe I am and ever ſhall be Only in the Lord John Brinſley .
