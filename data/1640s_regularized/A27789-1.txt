TO THE RIGHT-HONORABLE EDVVARD Earl of Manchester , Speaker ( pro tempore ) of the How •• of Peers in Parliament . A double Epigram . NOw I see that malice fli • s As a Meteor from the skies , Never caring where it light , So it show sufficient spite , Here , a pattern of the meek • ears aspersion on his check , Native pure • esse clears again , As a spring his muddy stain . Lo , his countenance confutes All these vile and vulgar bruits , Scattering mists where he does bow That bright splendour of his brow , Fret Errinnys , break thy gall , Till it drown thee , spleen and all : I must tell his trust abroad , In this well deserved Ode , For his country h • th not seen One more true then he hath been . My Lord and loadstone of my heart and more , I felt none mortal pull so strong before , O let me still find favour in those eyes That scatter clouds ; and where bright Sunbeams rise . To the tribunal of so mild a look I will adventure this Oracular book , The which elsewhere I have presented twice , And at the third time shall not bore the price . I care not , I , although I hear men say , Your Psalms are censured for Apocrypha : I ask no more , but when you next consult , You please to let them sing Quicunque vult . My last ambition is but to present Great gratulation to the Parliament ; And till this promised panegyric come , I leave this beggaring poetry strook dumb . Reader vouchsafe to see , and look , and taste a sup of Hymns , and creamy afterings , made up in the last sheet of all the book , with directions given to make all even , if the Reader also please to see the titles and the prefaces .
