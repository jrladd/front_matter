TO My Dear , Loving , and deservedly esteemed Friends , the Inhabitants of Bartholmew Exchange , LONDON , Truth and Peace , Grace and Glory . I Must ever mention both in private to God , and in public to the world , the love and favour which J have received from your Congregation , how when J was unknown , you owned me , when a stranger , you took me in , when exiled from mine own , you made me yours ; and that not only with extraordinary readiness , when we first did meet , but with constant and continued tenderness since our meeting : I shall ever strive to the utmost of my desires , and endeavours , to make acknowledgement of such receipts , and what J shall fail of in those , to make them up in prayers , and thanks . This present mite that is tendered to you , accept as pledge and earns â€¢ of all these , the valve of it is . as small as the volume ; but what it wants of worth and Learning , conceive to be supplied with observance and gratitude . The multitude of Expositions upon this Book of Exodus , hath made this of mine so very little ; for to set down what they had done before , were and idle labour , and to find out something that they had not set down , was a labour as difficult ; what I have done here in this kind , J refer to the Reader ; although J my self be settled and satisfied in the most of them , yet shall J not put them upon the belief of any , further than their due examination , and strength of reason shall make their way . From my House in the upper end of Moore-Lane . Novemb. 28. 1643. Yours , ever ready to observe and serve you in the Lord , J. L.
