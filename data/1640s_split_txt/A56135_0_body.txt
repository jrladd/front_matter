HAving formerly preſented Your Honorable Aſſembly with a large Hiſtoricall Collection of the ſeverall Execrable Treaſons, Conſpiracies, Rebellions, Seditions, Oppreſsions, Antimonarchicall practiſes of our Lordly Prelates, in all former and late ages, in my Antipathy of the Engliſh Lordly Prelacy, both to Regall Monarchy, and Civill Vnitie (which gave a fatall blow to the Prelaticall partie;) I thereupon conjectured my Domesticall Collections of that nature, had arrived at a Non ultra: But the Death of ſome eminent Members of the Commons Houſe (principally intereſſed in the Archbiſhops proſecution) inevitably engaging me at a dead lift (through the Committees requeſt) to make good the grand Charge againſt this Arch-Prelate, and bring him to his long expected Tryall, (a trouble which I gladly would have declined:) thereupon the Importunity of diverſe Honourable Friends in both Houſes, whom I could not deny, hath (beyond expectation) in the midſt of many other diſtracting occaſions, impoſed on me this further Trouble, of collecting the enſuing Breviate of his Life, abstracted (for the moſt part word for word) out of his owne Diary and Papers: which being a neceſſary Prologue to the much deſired Hiſtory of his Tryall (wherein his Crimes here pretermitted, will appeare in their proper Colours) was conceived to bee a fitter Fore-runner, then Concomitant of it.

There was one ſpeciall conſideration which for a time did ſomewhat diſſwade me from this ſervice, to wit a miſconſtruction which ſome no doubt will make of my publications in this kinde, as if they proceeded meerly, or principally from malice, or revenge of former Injuries and Cruelties inflicted on me by this Archbiſhops means. But my own Conſcience and forbearance to meddle with his Proſecution, till publikely called and neceſsitated thereunto, acquitting me from any ſuch imputation; and the never ſufficiently admired Providence of my ever-Gracious God in preſerving me ſafe in the midſt of all former troubles, impriſonments, ſufferings, reducing me in ſafetie by an Omnipotent hand (beyond all expectation of Friends, and Enemies) even with honour and triumph, from my long cloſe impriſonment and exile in forraigne parts (to which this Arch-Prelate had eternally deſigned me, without hopes of Redemption,) and ſince, that in ſelecting me above all others, by publike authoritie, (contrary to my inclination and deſire) to bee both the ſeizer and peruſer of his papers, & proſecuter of his long delayed Tryall; (the protraction whereof by many adorable providences, was one principall meanes of making good his charge, though at firſt it ſeemed to diſable its proofe;) I could not (in purſuance of this moſt remarkable worke of Providence) but moſt cheerfully proceed in this impoſed Imployment, notwithſtanding all other Diſcouragements, Impediments: which being brought to this perfection, I humbly commend to the publike view of the world under your Honours moſt Noble Patronage, to whom I moſt humbly preſent it, only with this one moſt Iust and Equitable Requeſt, which I beſeech You ſeriouſly to lay to heart.
It was once a Proverb, but now a ſad Complaint, that great bodies, have very ſlow motions, & (alas) many experimentally feele its verity. There are to my knowledg ſome hundreds of pious Chriſtians quite ruined, or much impaired in their fortunes, by the Tyrannie and Injuſtice of this oppreſsing Arch-Prelate and his Confederates; who at the beginning of this Parliament became humble Suitors to it, for Reliefe and Reparation of their Dammages. Their cauſes therupon were then, to their great expence, fully heard, and voted at ſeverall Committees; many of them reported in the Houſes, their unjuſt ſentences there ordered to be vacated; yea ſpeedy Recompences of their loſſes, Dammages, then promiſed, expected. But yet now at laſt (after two or three years tedious expectation, and ſollicitation) their ſufferings,
Pſal. 31.12, Pſal. 88.5, 6. cauſes, loſſes, are almoſt quite forgotten, themſelves (like dead

men out of mind whom we remember no more) farther from any hopes of reliefe then ever, being ſo remote from receiving ſatisfaction for their wrongs, that they ſtill lye under the power of their former illegall Sentences, Breſſures: And if times ſhould alter, their Witneſſes or Oppreſſours dye or miſcarry (as many of them have done) or themſelves depart this life before their Cauſes fully determined, they and theirs ſhould be left altogether remedileſſe, and utterly ruined, without redreſſe. Now I humbly beſeech Your Honours, ſadly to conſider on the one ſide, what an heart-breaking, and grand Diſcouragement it wil be, not only to theſe preſent Sufferers, but to all others in future times to become publike Martyrs for their Country or Religion: and on the other ſide, what a great Encouragement it will prove to Tyrants, Oppreſſors in preſent and future times to exerciſe all manner of Cruelties, and Iniustice, if the remedy ſhall prove almoſt as bad as the diſeaſe, and poore oppreſſed Suppliants in the higheſt degree, find either no reliefe at all, or ſuch ſlow redreſſe of their grievances, as ſhall quite weare out their patience, and remainder of their decaied eſtates, and that even in Parliaments (where remedies in former times were moſt ſpeedy, certaine) and their Oppreſſors, ſuch Dilatory proceedings againſt them, as ſhal be equivalent to Impunity, and exempt both them, their heirs, and Executors from rendring Competent dammages, to thoſe they have oppreſſed.
I confeſſe the great publicke preſsing Occaſions, Warres and Diſtractions in all our Realms have bin the chieſe Remora to Your deſired ſpeedy reliefe of oppreſſed Suitors, Your puniſhment of Delinquents, and may pleade your juſt excuſe; But yet I humbly ſupplicate You (moſt Noble Senators) ſo farre to commiſerate the long unredreſſed Grievances of theſe afflicted ones, as now at laſt to allot ſome vacant dayes each weeke, for the finall determination of their diſcontinued & almoſt forgotten Complaints; that they and theirs, may not have cauſe hereafter to lament, A failer of Iuſtice even in the ſupremeſt Court of Iuſtice: the undelaied execution whereof both in point of Reliefe and Puniſhment, hath beene the chiefe ſupport of Our Parliaments Honour, and of the peoples love and aſsiſtance to Parliaments.

It is one of the principall clauſes in 
Chap. 29.
Magna Charta, wch Our Anceſtors, and your Honours have ſo much contended for,

and we all have lately Covenanted to maintaine,Eccl. 4.1.2.
viz. We ſhall deny, NOR DEFERRE TO NO MAN IVSTICE OR RIGHT. Let it therfore be put in preſent reall execution, that ſo none may have cauſe to take up this mournfull complaint of Solomon; I returned and conſidered all the Oppreſſions that are done under the Sun: and beheld the teares of ſuch as were Oppreſſed, and they had no Comforter: Wherefore I praiſed he dead, that are already dead, more than the living that are yet alive, &c. And this through Gods bleſsing will bee the ſpeedieſt way to put a period to our Wars, Diſtractions, Grievances, and gaine Your Honours higheſt Reputation, Grace Favour with God, and all good men.

Now the good God ſtrengthen both Your hearts and hands to execute ſpeedy Pſa. 103.6. Pſal. 10.18.
Iuſtice, and Iudgement for all that are oppreſſed, that the man of the earth may no more oppreſſe; and Crowne all your publike Councells, Enterpriſes with ſuch happie ſucceſſe, as may occaſion all ſucceeding Generations, to bleſſe God for You, as the beſt-deſerving Parliament ever yet Aſſembled: which is the Cordiall Prayer of
