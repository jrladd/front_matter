HOw tenacious the heart of man is of ſuperſtition,
as former ages, ſo the preſent
generation doe abundantly declare. No
age can yeeld a more horrid instance of a
people taught ſo much as this Nation
hath beene concerning the true Worſhip
of God, admoniſhed ſo often▪ that God is not pleaſed by humane
rites, and yet ſtill place their Religion in them, oppugne

and withall aiming at your edification, J have preſumed in
publiſhing this Sermon, to prefixe your Names, to whom J
