ETernally Renowned Senators, and most cordiall Philopaters
to Your bleeding, dying dearest Country, (from
which no menacing Terrors, of armed Adversaries, nor
flattering Promises of hypocriticall Court-friends, could
hitherto divorce your sincerest Affections, and withdraw
your undefatigablest Industries in the least degree,
to its betraying, or enslaving;) I here humbly prostrate
to your most mature Iudgements, and recommend to
your Highest, Noblest Patronage, this Quadruple Discourse,
OF THE SOVERAIGNE POWER OF PARLIAMENTS
AND KINGDOMES, (now at last compacted
into one intire Body, though formerly scattered abroad in dismembred Parts,
rather out of necessity to gratifie others, then conveniency to content my
selfe,) in which as Your Honours have the greatest Interest, so it is just and equall
You should enjoy the absolutest Propriety: being compiled by Your Encouragement,
Printed by Your Authority; published for Your Iustification, to vindicate
your indubitable ancient Soveraign Priviledges from the unjust Detractions; Your
legall necessary late Proceedings, from the malicious, false, unjust Aspersions of
those Royallists, Malignants, intemperate Pens & Tongues,
2 Pet 2. 12, 14, 15.
Who like naturall
bruite beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speake evill of the things they understand
not, and shall perish in their owne corruption: Cursed children, who have forsaken
the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the sonne of
Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousnesse; but was rebuked for his iniquity.

I must ingenuously confesse, that the Subject matter, and grand publicke
Differences betweene King & Parliament (yea betweene most Kings and Kingdomes
in the world) herein debated, are of such an extraordinary, rare, transcendent
nature; of such infinite, universall consequence, weight, concernment,

yea so full of dangerous Precipes, Rockes, if not inextricable difficulties on either
hand, as might justly require, not onely one person of the exquisitest judgement,
Heroicallest Spirit, greatest experience, deepest Policy, absolutest abilities,
vastest knowledge in all kindes of Learnings, States, Governments;
and most exempt from all other imployments, that might interrupt him in
these kindes of Studies; but even an whole Parliament, or Oecumenicall Councell
of the most experienced, ablest, learnedest, wisest Statists in the Universe,
and many yeares most advised consideration, exactly to ventilate and determine
them: Which consideration might have justly daunted, yea quite deterred
me, (the meanest of ten thousand, furnished with no competent abilities,
and having scarce one vacant houre, but what I have borrowed from
my naturall rest, to accomplish so vast an undertaking) from this most difficult,
weighty, publicke, service, sufficient to sinke the strongest Hercules, if not
Atlas himselfe, the worlds supporter: But yet the Goodnesse, the Commonnesse
of the Cause, (which concernes our whole three Kingdomes, Parliaments,
Religion, and every one of our well-beings, in this present world)
the deare affection, I beare to my native Country, Religion, Posterity, Parliaments,
and your Honours; the defect of other Advocates to plead this publicke Cause;
seconded with the private earnest intreaties (which were as so many Commands
to me) of some Members of Your Honourable Assembly, to undertake this
weighty taske, & their authorizing my rude Collections for the Presse, were such
strong exciting ingagements to me to undertake this difficult imployment,
that I chose of two extreames, rather to discover mine owne insufficiency in
an impotent speedy discharge of this great service, so farre transcending my
weake indowments; than to shew any want of sincerity or industry in deserting
this grand Cause in a time of need. It beeing one chiefe Article of my beliefe,
ever since I first read the Scriptures, and Tullies Offices; That I was principally
born for my Countries good (next to Gods glory involved in it;) Upon which
ground I have ever bent all my Studies to promote it what I might, though to my particular losse and disadvantage.
The sole end I aime at in these Treatises, is the re-establishment of my bleeding,
expiring Countries endangered Liberties, Priviledges, Rights, Lawes, Religion,
the curing of her mortall wounds, the restauration of her much desired
Peace, in truth and righteousnesse, the supportation of Parliaments (the
onely Pillars, Bulwarkes of our Church, State, Lawes, Liberties, Religion) in their
perfect lustre, and full Soveraigne Authority; the removall of those present
grievances, differences, Warres, (arising principally from ignorant or wilfull
mistakes of the Parliaments just Priviledges and the Kings due Prerogatives)
which threaten present ruine to them all; for whose future prosperity, security
I could (withExod. 32. 32.
Moses, andRom, 9. 4.
Paul) heartily wish my selfe to be blotted

out of the Booke of life, and to be accursed from Christ; neither count I may life, limbes,
liberties, or any earthly comforts deare unto me, so I may any wayes promote Gods
glory and the publike welfare. And certainely had the most of men in publike
places, but Heroicke publike Spirits, (as I make no doubt all Your Honours have)
byassed with no private Interests, or base selfe-respects, studying nothing but
the common-good, our present unnaturall warres would soone be determined,
our greatest differences easily reconciled, our foraine Irish, French, Walloon Popish
Forces, brought in to cut our English Protestants and their Religions
throats, before our faces, (at which horrid spectacle I wonder all English
spirits rise not up with unanimous indignation in stead of joyning with them)
easily expulsed, our remaining Grievances speedily redressed, our disordered
Church Reformed, our Pristine Peace and Prosperity restored, yea entayled to us
and our Posterities for ever; whereas the private selfe-ends, selfe-interests, of
some ambitious, covetous, malicious, treacherous, timerous publicke persons,
(who serve no other Deity, Majesty, or Republicke, but themselves alone) have
most shamefully imbroyled, betrayed, and endangered both our Kingdoms, Parliaments,
Liberties, Religion, Properties, yea, all the blessings we formerly
enjoyed; whose names and memories shall be ever execrable to all Posteritie
upon Earth, & their Soules, Bodies, eternally tortured in hel, (without repentance)
for this their inhumane, unchristian Treachery, and Realme-destroying, Church-subverting
selfe-seeking, detestable both to God and Men.
To conjure downe such base degenerous private spirits to the infernall pit,
or else to elevate and inflame them with great heroicke publike thoughts, there
is nothing more effectuall (in my weake apprehension) than the well-grounded
knowledge, serious study, and full vindication of such publike Truthes, concerning
Publike Governement, and the Soveraigne Iurisdiction of Parliaments, Kingdomes,
Magistrates, People as are here debated, ratified, freed from those blacke
aspersions of sedition, faction, rebellion, treason, conspiracy, mutiny, singularity,
disloyalty, and the like, which sordid Sycophants, selfe-seeking Monopolists,
Courtiers, Royallists, or malignant Delinquents, have most injuriously cast upon
them to delude the world; which long obscured Truthes, though they may
seeme dangerous Paradoxes, and upstart Enthusiasmes, at the first proposall, to
many ignorant, seduced Soules, kept over long in Cymmerian darkenesse, by those Aegyptian taske-masters, who have studyed to increase and perpetuate
their bondage; Yet upon serious examination will prove to be most ancient,
indubitable Verities, universally received, beleeved, practised, by most Realmes
and Nations in the Universe, from the beginning of Monarchy till this present;
and the contrary received opinions, to be but the vaine, empty Brainesicke
lying fancies of a few illiterate, impolitick Court-Chaplaines, Lawyers,
Sycophants, who never dived into the Principles Constitutions, Lawes,

Histories of States and Realmes, or into the true originall grounds of Regall,
Regnall, Popular, or Parliamentary Iurisdictions; and writ onely to flatter Princes,
to purchase honour, gaine, or favour to themselves; without any respect at
all to Verity, or the Common good, which never entred into their narrow private
thoughts.
What entertainement these New-published common Truthes, are like to find
in Court, and elsewhere among many men, I may easily conjecture by that
ingrate requitall Your Honours have received from them, for all your faithfulnesse,
paines, cost, diligence, service for the Publike safety. Never did any Parliament
in England deserve halfe so well as this, for their indefatigable labours
night and day, almost three whole yeares space together, for the Common
good: Yet never was any halfe so ill requited. Never did any demerit greater
publike applause; never any underwent halfe so many vile Libellous reproaches,
slanders, of all sorts, even for well-doing; and that not onely in vulgar Discourses,
but in Presse and Pulpit too. Never did Parliament in any age sit
halfe so long, or doe halfe that worke, or get any such publike establishment, as this;
and yet all our Parliaments put together, were never so much opposed, traduced,
secretly conspired against, or openly assaulted with armed violence to
dissolve and ruine them, as this one alone; against whom not onely the Pope
with all his Antichristian Members, at home and abroad, but (which is almost
a Miracle, not formerly heard of in any age) both King, Queene, Prince, Privy
Counsellors, Courtiers; yea divers Nobles, and Members of both Houses, contrary
to their owne Protestations, have utterly deserted it, yea bent all their
policies, wits, Forces together, to dissolve and null it, (and in it all future
Parliaments,) as no Parliament at all, but as an Assembly of obstinate refractory
Traytors, and Rebels; when as all your Actions, Proceedings, Declarations,
Protestations, proclaime you nothing lesse, yea the best-deserving Parliamentary
Assembly that ever this Nation was blessed with, and those Heroicke
Champions, who have lately regained, resetled (as farre as humane Lawes and Ordinances
can secure them) our lost, at least decayed Liberties, Lawes, Priviledges,
Religion, in despite of all oppositions, and utterly suppressed that confederated
Triumvirate (of the Counsel-chamber, Starchamber, and High-Commission)
which had almost enthralled us in more than Aegyptian bondage, and resolved
to detaine both us and our Posterity under it, without the least hopes of any
enfranchisement. Never were there halfe so many publike regall Protestations,
Declarations, Proclamations, Oathes, Remonstrances, solemnely made and
published to the world, for the inviolable preservation of all just Rights and Priviledges
of Parliament, as there have beene in this; and yet never were there
so many apparent violations of the undoubted Rights and Priviledges of Parliament
in all former ages whatsoever, as in this one Parliament onely, now at

last so far affronted, by open Proclamation, (even against an Act of Parliament,
passed by the King and both Houses when fullest,) to be Proclaimed to the
world, No Parliament at all, but a meere factious, seditious Conventicle. Which
how inconsistent it is with other former Oathes & Protestations, let all wise men
judge. However; this may be some good incouragement to your Honours, and
My selfe too, that if all his Majesties solemne Printed Protestations, Oathes,
Proclamations, Remonstrances to his people and all the world, with deepest
imprecations on himselfe and his Posterity, to maintaine the Lawes and Liberties
of the Subject, the just Priviledges and power of Parliaments, and Protestant
Religion to the utterrmost, be as cordially, as really intended, as they
are pretended, your Honourable proceedings, and these my polemicall Discourses
(really defending, vindicating, the indubitable Priviledges of
Parliaments,
the Subjects Liberties, Lawes, and our Religion against all Opposites whatsoever,)
cannot but finde most gracious acceptation with his Majesties owne person,
yea, with all his Counsellors, Courtiers, Cavalliers, who beare any sincere
affection either to the Parliaments Priviledges, their Countries Liberties, or
Religion: which all doubt an Army of English; Irish, Outlanding Papists,
will hardly fight for, or maintaine, but really subvert, if possible.
However, Your Honours kinde, favourable entertainment, and Noble
Patronage, of these my unworthy publicke Labours (of which I cannot doubt)
accompanyed with the consciousnesse of my owne sincerity and loyalty, in the
whole contexture of them (though some out of malice, envy, or flattery may
and will misconster them, as they have done other of my Writings, to my
great dammage and danger) shall be a sufficient Sanctuary to secure both
Me and them, against all adverse Powers and Detractions whatsoever: and
if I chance to suffer any future hard measure, of what kinde soever, for doing
my Country or Your Honours the best and faithfullest service I am able, I shall
repute it my greatest honour, my chiefest felicity, and chearefully undergoe it
(through Gods assistance) not as a Crosse of infamy, but a Crowne of Glory:
And so much the rather, because your Honours have formerly taken up
this Magnanimous resolution, yea sealed it with solemne publike Cove
•
ants and
Protestations, to live and dye in the just defence of your Priviledges, Country, and
Religion, (never so much indangered, banded against by foraigne and domesticke
Papists, Atheists, as now) and never to desert them whiles you have one
drop of blood in your veines, or any breath in your Nostrils: and God forbid, but
that I, and all other true Members of our State and Church, should cordially
concurre with you in this Heroicall Covenant, which the desperate

See Romes Masterpeece
Confederacies
of our Romish Adversaries, long prosecuted among us, and now almost
promoted to perfection, have necessarily engaged Your Honors and the whole
Kingdom to enter into, for their Preservation.



Now the God of Peace, and Lord of Hoasts, be ever mightily present with,
and in Your Honourable Assembly, to counsell, direct, protect, prosper all your
sincere endevours to promote his Gospell, Truth, Honour, the publike welfare,
liberty, tranquillity, security of our endangered lacerated Church and Realmes,
