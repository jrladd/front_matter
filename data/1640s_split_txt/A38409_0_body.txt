GOe litle Booke, (my unlick't Poetry)
And be a Patron to thy ſelfe and mee,
Shift it among the crowd, and never ſtay
To dreſſe thy ſelfe, like other trim and gay,


•
ith borrow'd Titles, pluckt from great Ones, who
Are honoured by the Honour that they doe,


•
eare thy owne cloathes, and thinke it more to be
Knowne by thy face, then by a livery.


•
e're truſt unto fond fickleneſſe, that may
Afford a ſmile at firſt, and then betray,
That hiſſe and kill, that by embraces ſmother,
With one hand take, and throw away with th' other,
That ow'n a Booke, becauſe the 
〈◊〉
 ownes them,
Or elſe they'd never ow'n the Booke agen,
Let thoſe that can warpe Conſcience in a ſtraine
And count it but a Poets Spencer veine
To fawne and flatter, and have learnt to call;
One Good, becauſe he's Great, though worſt of all;


Let thoſe who can weigh vertue by the pound,
Where it is ſcarce by Drammes and Ounces foun
•


Who make it then chiefe Maſterpiece of wit,
To Banckrupt Honour by out-rayling it
Who can ſay I, or No, ſweat, freeze, as hee
Is hot or could, who is their Deity.
Let ſuch Idolatours of Greatneſſe ſhew,
They dare not walke abroad unleſſe they goe
Vnder ſome Hee or Shee-Protection:
My Muſe ſhall venture in another faſhion
Make thine owne licence (little one) and bee
Protection to thy ſelfe, a Paſſe to mee.
And let ſuch ſcratching Patron-mongers know
Thou'lt not on ſtilts, nor yet on Crutches goe,
On thy own feet thou'lt either runne or crawle
And if thou 
•
 anſt not ſtand on them, thou'lt fall,
Weigh neither ſmile nor froune, but when you ſee
Beſt uſage ſay, this ſhall my Patronbee:
And as for others that disdaine, ſay thou
My Maſter ownes me not, and why ſhould you?
