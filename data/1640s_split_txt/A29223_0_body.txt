SIr, here receive these Obit-teares of Ours,
While Native Love and Duty nourish Yours:
Let us then joyne our Funerall Odes in One,
"His dearest God-sonne with his Eldest Sonne.

Though Heires in such like Teares doe seldom share,
I'm sure true Tears streame from your Fathers Heire.



Excuse me, Sir, that these come forth so late,
"They come too soone by'Voice and Vote oth'State.
