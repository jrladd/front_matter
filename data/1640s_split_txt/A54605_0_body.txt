SIR,

I Have had many flying thoughts, concerning the
Advancement of Reall Learning in generall, but
particularly of the Education of Youth, Mathematicks,
Mechanicks, Physick, and concerning the History
of Art and Nature, with some more serious ones
concerning your owne most excellent advices for an
Office of Publick addresse. And indeed they were
but flying thoughts, for seeing what vast summes
were requisite to carry on those designes, and how unwilling
or unable men generally were to contribute
towards them, I thought it but labour lost to fix my
mind much upon them.
But it having pleased God unexpectedly, to make me
the Inventor of the Art of Double Writing, daily and
hourly usefull to all sorts of Persons in all places of
the world, and that to perpetuity, I conceived that if
there were understanding enough in Men to be sensible
of their own good, and Thankfulnesse or honesty
enough to reward the Contrivers of it, such Meanes
might be raised out of this Art as might at least set the
aforementioned Designs on float, and make them ready
to set saile toward the haven of perfection upon every
opportunity of stronger gales. And thereupon I

reassumed my Meditations, which I here give you, desiring
you and your Ingenious Freinds to remeditate
upon them and correct them, but withall to think of
the best Course, how to improve my Invention to such
advantage, as may if possible, make us capable of enjoying
more then bare Ideas of that Happinesse, which
the atchievements of our designs promiseth. I shall
desire you to shew them unto no more then needs
you must, since they can please only those few, that are
Reall Friends to the Designe of Realities, not those
who are tickled only with Rhetoricall Prefaces, Transitions,
& Epilogues, & charmed with fine Allusions and
Metaphors, (all which I do not condemn) wherewith,
as I had no abilities to adorne my discourse, so I wanted
all other requisites thereunto, Having written it
(as Your self must beare me witnesse) at your own Importunity
in the midst of my cares and indeavours, to
perfect mine Invention, and which is work in the
midst of my hard and perhaps unprofitable labour, to
prevent the ingratitude and backwardnesse of men to
reward him, who shall earnestly labour to expresse
himselfe,

London the 8.
