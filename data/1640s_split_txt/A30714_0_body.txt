(TO All the worthy Citizens of LONDON, Borne in the Towne of STAMFORD in the County of Lincolne, that have been or intend to be Benefactors to the same: And more especially to those two worthy Brothers and members of that City, Mr. Robert Bullack, and Mr. Iohn Bullack, who have not onely beene Pious and charitable Benefactors to their said Native towne; but also liberall and indulgent Incouragers to this present Survey thereof).


GEntlemen, I here present unto you for a New-yeares guift, the Survey of your Cradle-places; a Worke upon which I fixed my first thoughts by the motion which some of you by letter made unto others, who eyther not at leisure, or not willing; or hindered by some other impediment, I know not what, forbare the enterprise: Which I perceiving (though the unfittest of many

others) have presumed to set my Pen on worke, rather then your desires should be altogether frustrate, or that I should conceale what I know; have heard, or read of my Native towne. As it is homely, so I hope it is harmlesse; if it appeare not worthy of your applause, yet I hope it will no way appeare worthy of your displeasures; take it therefore as it is meant, not as it might have been made better by me, for it is the best that my poore Invention, observation, or reading can afford, or the treasury of my Note-booke can render.
It had come to your viewes some Moneths before this, had not the troubles of these Times hindered my intended speed: Yet glad I am I have finished it at the end of the Old yeare, hoping it would have bin published at the beginning of the new. If it be thought usefull for the Publique, I desire for the publique good it may be published, and that what Errors have escaped my Pen, may by the Corrector be amended, by the Reader pardoned, and the whole substance of this Survey be by you kindly accepted; From him who is and ever will be a lover of you and your Native place whilest he is



Stamford
the 1. of Ianuary, 1646.
