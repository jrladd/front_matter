THis little following
book
had beene in
the Printers



hands diverse daies ere
ever I purposed any
nuncupation, or dedication
of it at all. At
last, it came into my
minde to addresse it
this way, and that for
these causes. first, out of
honour to your chiefe,
Arch-Bishop Hutton, of
whom for his learning,
and gravitie, this great
Encomium was publiquely
given, that hee
was worthy to sit President
in a generall Councell.
Secondly, because
I was well ascertained,
my book could receive



no smut from you, being
people of whole
fame for native gentlenesse,
innocency of
manners, faire deportment,
and for the constant
and uniforme profession
of Religion.
Thirdly, for that the
most of you are spread
into a goodly posterity
and have faire sonnes
and daughters, unto
whom these things may
bee truely usefull to
ground them soundly
in Religion, so as neither
Abundance can
choake, nor Indigence

ever starve in them those
due respects they owe to
divine powers. Would
God parents would at
last be wise, and thinke
it were conduceable to
the hopefull setling of
a child, to aime at more
of instruction and institution,
though lesse
of provision. Fourthly,
in acknowledgement of
that great love, sweet familiarity,
and continuall
intercourses of Christian
acquaintance which
you were ever pleased
to hold with mee, both
affecting my person,



and leaning to my ministery
farre beyond
the proportion of desert.
Lastly, and especially
for the pious memory
of that worthy
Knight Sir Timothy Hutton,
your deare Father,
and my most incorrupt
Patron. Into the mention
of whom being fallen,
I cannot containe
my pen, but to his great
praise I must relate one
or two things of him in
this very regard: first
that comming to settle
his family at Marske,
and finding the Rector

there to be no more but
a bare reader, he rested
not till hee had compounded
forth the present
incumbent, and filled
the Church with a
preaching Ministery.
And when it was empty
againe by the death of
that incumbent, he most
freely presented my selfe
with out the least request
made in my behalfe to
him, either by my selfe,
or any other; yea hee
besought mee earnestly
to take it, and when he
signed the presentation
he drew with his pen the



forme of his heart betweene
his name and
sir-name. and I can well
take an accompt of my
memory, that the Bpp
of the diocesse, when he
gave institution, asserted
vehemently that I
had the best and most
upright Patron living.
This I say not onely for
his honour, but also for
the just defamation both
of such Patrons (sonnes
of the earth whosoever
they be) as thinke heaven
and earth would
faile them for maintenance
and support, if



they should present a
Father and Priest without
some sprinckling
either of direct or indirect
symonie: and also
of such Clerkes as professe
they believe the resurrection
of their bodies
after they are calcined
to dust, and yet
dare not trust God for
food and raiment, without
these indirect and
symoniacall contracts.
But I containe.
These things therefore
(my much honoured,
and most deerely
respected friends) I present



unto you, and together
with them whatsoever
is worth acceptance
either in the person
or function of
