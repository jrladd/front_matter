R. Honorable,


I Intreate you to accept of
this Dedication, it being
for the good of all those that have
travelled, or desire to travell:
for the one, it will instruct, and
to the other, it will be necessary
for the helpe of his memory. Look
not on the smalnesse of the gift,
but on the good will and affection
wherewith I have translated it

out of Italian into English, hereunto
having also added many
notes and observations of my last
travels which I made these last
two yeeres through Spaine, Italy,
and France. The work, I dare
not say, deserves your protection,
it being a greater token of Nobility,
in you to patronize with your
greatnes that which is mean in it
selfe, than only to be favourable
where merit may challenge liberality;
yet the work is necessary for
all this Kingdome, rich or poore,
traveller or not traveller, wherein
they may al benefit themselves,
it serving for a guide to those
that go abroad, and a Map for
those at home. So I humbly take
my leave, desiring the Almighty
to blesse and prosper you, and conclude
with this Spanish Adage or

Proverbe, Lo que mata auno
sana a otro, and say to the Critique
that shall condemne that
which he cannot mend himselfe,
That which is one mans meat, is
another mans poyson. Let the
more judicious judge. vale.
