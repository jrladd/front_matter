YOu whom Astrea greets, were you all right,
I had not been so sharp, nor had this night
Been twisted into whip-cold: Was it made,
To help the Jaylours, or the Beadles trade?
I am your Vsher, come, for here's a race
Able to bring the Hang-man to disgrace.


You are to find out sinners, and to give
Them punishment; that honestie might live
In Courts of justice; that the world may see;
How some of widow Truths posteritie
Do walk in gownes; should favour, friends, or lyes,
Or feare, or bribes, blind any of your eyes?
But ah! they do too much! some of you nurse
These Fly-blowne vermin, stiled Englands curse.
Convert not sins, nor plagues into a jest,
Nor yet with mischiefes make your selves a feast.
I do but move in Court, I dare not treat
With upstart Plush. which sin hath made so great.


To Justices, and Judges, I present
(And all inferiour Officers intent
Vpon the publike good) these humble straines,
As the untutour'd issue of my braines,
Rough with revenge; although conceiv'd at night,
You may bring forth my black birds to the light,
And heare'em chirp. Let sin have no release,
Which nourisheth our woes, and wounds our peace.
