RIGHT WORSHIPFULL,


WHen through ſundry and continued
abuſes offered mee by thoſe
whoſe ſuperſtition I have impugned,
I was neceſſitated to commit
this Treatiſe to the Preſſe: After
ſome deliberation I tooke boldneſſe
to Dedicate the ſame to you, being
encouraged hereunto, partly by reaſon of your favourable
Affection to my poore Selfe, which I thankfully acknowledge;
partly alſo and eſpecially becauſe of your knowne
ſincere affection to the Truth, and hatred of all ſuperſtitious
Vanities; and alſo becauſe you are a right Worthy
Member of that Honourable Body of the Houſe of Commons,
whoſe endeavour is to clenſe the waters of the Sanctuary,
from that filth and bitternes, whereby they have

been defiled by too many, that they may run pure and
cleere, to refreſh the Soules of Gods People, I meane to
root out thoſe ſuperſtitions and innovations, which have
ſo long peſtred the Church, and grieved the well-affected:
amongſt which this Ceremony is one, which you have
not long ſince forbidden by your religious Order, though
contrary to the ſame, Pride and ſhame makes the Preachers
of to keepe it up, and ſuch malignant Principles, by
which theſe men have polluted the Peoples judgements,
makes them ſtill to practiſe it. This opinion indeed is
very ſpecious, making a ſhew to the ignorant, of great humilitie,
religion, and holines, when indeed it is a Monſter
of many heads; there being not many Points of Popery,
that produce more dangerous Concluſions than it doth,
(eſpecially in the ſenſe that ſome hold it.) The Text which
they pretend for this Ceremony being as contrary to it,
as light is to darkneſſe.
The Lord bleſſe you, and the truly vertuous Lady, the
Lady Clerke, your religious Yoke-fellow, and all yours
and hers, with his choiceſt mercies, and powre out his
eſpeciall bleſſings upon that Honourable Houſe of Parliament,
whereof you are a Member, that you may be
ſtill tendred of him as the Apple of his eye, and continually
preſerved from the Plots and fury of the malignant
partie, to the glory of God, the ſafetie of Sion, and the
perfect Reformation of this Church and Kingdome,
which all true Iſraelites deſire, and pray for, that future
Generations may praiſe GOD for you, and call you
bleſſed.
