May it please your Highnesse;

WHat the Great PhilosopherAristot. polit. lib. 7, cap. 16. hath observed of Mens Bodies, is, upon so much stronger Reasons, true of their Mindes, by how much our Intellectuall Maturity is more lingring, and sluggish than our Naturall, That the too Early Conceptions and Issues of them doe usually

proove but weake and unusefull. And we shall seldome find, but that those venturous Blossoms, whose over-hastie obedience to the Early Spring doth anticipate their proper season, and put forth too soone, doe afterwards for their former boldnesse suffer from the injury of severer weather, except at least some happy shelter, or more benigne influence redeeme them from danger. The like Infelicity I finde my selfe obnoxious unto at this time. For I know not out of what disposition of minde, whether out of love of Learning (for Amo

Love is venturous, and conceives difficult things easier then they are) or whether out of a Resolution to take some account from my selfe of those few yeares wherein I had then been planted in the happiest of all Soyles, the Schooles of Learning; whether upon these, or any other Inducements, so it hath happened, that I long since have taken boldnesse in the Minority of my Studies to write this ensuing Treatise: That before I adventured on the endevour of

This hasty resolution having produced so untimely an issue, It hapned by some accident to be like Moses in his Infancy exposed to the Seas. Where I made no other account, but that its own weaknesse would there have revenged my former boldnesse, and betrai'd it unto perishing. But as he then, so this now, hath had the marvellous felicity to light on the view, and fall under the compassion of a very Gracious Princesse. For so farre hath your Highnesse vouchsafed (having hapned on the sight of this Tractate) to expresse fauour thereunto, as not onely to spend houres in it, and require a Transcript of it, but further to recommend it by your Gracious judgement vnto publike view. In which particular I was not to advice with mine owne Opinion,

being to expresse my humblest acknowledgement to your Highnesse.
This onely Petition I shall accompany it withall unto your Highnesse feete, That since it is a Blossome which put forth so much too soone, It may therefore obtain the Gracious Influence of your Highnesse favour, to protect it from that severity abroad which it otherwise justly feareth.
God Almighty make your Highnesse as great a Mirrour of his continuall Mercies, as he hath both of his Graces and of Learning.
