SIR,

THe cause of our lying still to day was, that the Clothes and Arms might be disposed, but principally, that Col: Harvey might not be too far engaged, who is marching after with the Associated Forces, and I hope, will be neer us to morrow night; and then I doubt not, but we shall march without stop or stay. By the inclosed, you'l see what I hear from Warwick.
