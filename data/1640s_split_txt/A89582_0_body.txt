My Lords and Gentlemen,


I Am not ignorant of the truth and weight of that ſpeech of Pliny, Aliud eſt ſcribere uni, aliud omnibus: the ſame holds of Preaching, it's one thing to Preach a Sermon to a Congregation, another thing to Preach it to all the world in Print; eſpecially upon ſuch an occaſion as this, and ſuch a ſeaſon as this, when the ſpirit of jealouſie and miſ-underſtanding is let looſe, and mens

hearts as tinder ready to catch and kindle at every ſparke; yet ſince you are pleaſed to conceive that this plaine Sermon may bee uſefull to others, and thereupon to order my publication of it, I humbly obey your Order, deſiring the Lords bleſsing to accompany it ſo farre as to make men wiſely conſider the wonderfull works of God, and returne to him the glory due unto his name; The ſame Lord watch over you, ſanctifie you and guide all your conſultations, that you may bee his bleſſed inſtruſtruments to make this Land a quiet habitation for his people, and a place which himſelfe may delight in: This is the daily prayer
