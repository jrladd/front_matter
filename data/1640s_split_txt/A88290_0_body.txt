SIR,


AS in thoſe more painfull imployments
you formerly underwent in Tranſmarine
parts you did with great fidelitie,
courage, and induſtry for ſundry
yeers, mannage the affaires of our Engliſh
Merchants intruſted to your care
and diſcretion: So now in this your preſent retirement,
your continuall Study makes it manifeſt, you
act not the part of a young man (though your yeeres
ſpeake you not aged) but like a wiſe man (that ever
husbands Time with advantage) You enrich your
minde with Knowledge, Converſe amongſt Studies,
and with Authors of wiſedome, that hereafter you
may be more ſerviceable to your Country as opportunitie
ſhall preſent you with a fit occaſion: I ſhall
not neede acquaint the World, that you have (as we
ſay changed heaven) and lived not further then five

degrees from the Aequinoctiall; yet have you ſtill remained
your ſelfe, and twice returned Statu quo, bettered
by your travells.
This little Treatiſe (of leſſe worth then I wiſh it) I
preſent unto you, and deſire your peruſall by way of
Recreation, (I am not ſingular in Dedicating a ſmall
thing to a worthy Friend: Iohn Dee a moſt Learned
man Dedicated his Aphoriſmes to Gerard Mercator a
man famous, and they conſiſted of leſſe then ſixe
ſheets.)
Wearied I ſay with more weighty Studies, run over
this, and the rather, becauſe its the firſt in this kinde
ever wrote by any: and you can judge whether 'tis
well or ill done, and few elſe: Your ſelfe have ſeene it
in looſe papers, from the beginning, middle, and to
the end of it, are able to teſtifie its my owne, I borrowed
it from no man, (that impertinent Traveller
ſpoake by Authority, who hoodwinked in judgement,
bleated openly that others performed my
Worke, yet he never ſaw me.)
Sir, Favour me with as much love in Receiving it
humanely, as I in Affection tender it unto You,
and You engage me to reſt,
