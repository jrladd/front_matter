Right Honourable,


IT is necessary
that Christians
should bee
warned of sin
against God,
lest they incurre his wrath.
And withall it is as necessary
that the sins of which
men are warned should be

plainely, and distinctly declared.
Without the one
mens consciences will sinne
without feare: without the
other they will feare where
no feare is: the defect of
the former will make conscien
•
es
secure: the want of
the la
•
ter perpetually unquiet,
o
•
 setled in errour.
And errours in conscience
produce many great evills
not onely ad intra in mens
owne soules, but also ad
extra in humane affaires.
The endeavouring then t
•

direct mens consciences in
practique cases cannot but
be a needfull and charitable
worke.
And surely as it is usefull
in other arguments, so very
needfull in this of scandals.

Few there bee that
heed the terrible commination
of our Saviour against
scandalizers, and therefore
are affected as if by
transmigration they had
Cains spirit, when he said
nunquid ego fratris mei
custos? Whence it is that
offences are multiplyed
dayly, many soules perish,
alienations of minde,
schismes, jarres and warres
too arise. Wee wish, wee
pray, I would wee might
say we hope for a true union
and consolidation of
mens minds. Certainly it
is not to be hoped without
removeall of scandals. On
the other side the greivous
threatning of our Lord
Christ doth so affright many

consciences, that they
are almost irresolute in every
thing they doe before
men, as fearing least there
be anguis in herba, some
scandall in it. In my small
reading and experience I
find few doubts of conscience,
concerning mens patent
actions, in the resolving
of which the difficulty
hath not most of all rested
on this point of scandals.
Which considerations
moved me to apply some
part of my studies to cleare
this argument, and to remove
this evill. And having
in this forme fashioned
a treatise, I cannot say
polished, it is now produced
into the light for publique
good by discovery of

truth. Such as it is I humbly
present to your Lordship,
as to a person made
honourable not only by your
high dignities, but also by
your noble vertues, manifested
abroade in your employments
of State, and in
this your native countrey
(wherein as in your proper
Orbe you shined many
yeares tanquam stella primae
magnitudinis) by
your eminent prudence and
integrity in government,
and by your rare, pious, and
large munificence in restoring
tithes, and bestowing
lands and building on the
Church, and indeared to
my selfe by reason of that
noble favour by which
your Honour hath beene

pleased to cheare me in
this very great, and very
poore Cure, in and under
which I now labour. Which
I beseech your Honour to
accept of as from him that
rejoyceth in the prosperity
of your Honour and your
noble House, and studies to
acquite himselfe
