Right worshipfull and worthy Commanders:


THIS Tract of warre cannot (I hope) be unwelcome to your Hands, whose Bodies are daily imployed in Martiall affaires. Nor let it seeme strange that one of my Profession should produce a subject of this Nature; seeing there are seldome any Leaguers without men of our Quality: The Ministring Levites were not onely in the Campes of Israell, but

also had their speciall Offices and Charges allotted to them. Such grace the Helmet, animate the Soldier, and fit him at all goings Out for his happier dissolution.
When I was abroad with our Armies (I speake it to their honor) I found large maintenance, and faire respect, though with a great deale of hazard both of fortune and life, in regard of the Enemies too great forces, and our long and hasty Marchings, together with tedious Beleaguerings: yet (by the

all-ruling Providence of God) I came off enriched with some knowledge, and Military experience; which I account a rich prize, though purchas'd at an high price.
I will not relate unto you the fearefull and horrid issues and effects of warre; such as are poverty and decay of Trading, famine, violence, depredation, destruction of Justice and Civility, slighting of Magistracy, firing and plundering of Countries, death of famous Commanders,

the vast slaughtering of men, women, and children, prophanation of Churches with the violation of Virgines and Matrones; For

been of excellency and usefulnesse) yet in these latter of small or no consequence. As also a short and compendious Discourse of the excellency of the Musquet and Halfe-Pike above other weapons, practis'd now with Ease and Activity by many ingenuous and Martiall spirits; and in times of needfull triall would be as full of Advantage.
VVhat I have here with paines and experience thus composed and digested, I present to your Loyall hands,

whose Iudgments (I know) can well determine of Military affaires, being so constantly imployed in that Noble and Heroick profession of Armes.
Not doubting, but that you who so love the practice, will also favour and incourage such who shall to their utmost advance and maintaine that noble and valorous Calling.
So praying for the increase of your Fames, as well as of your Numbers, I commend you all, and all

your weighty occasions to the protection of the Lord of all Victory: being
