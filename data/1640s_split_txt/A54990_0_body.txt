May it pleaſe your good Lordſhips and fellow Adventurers,

HAving been blaſted with the whirlwind of this late, unnaturall and civill Engliſh war, ſeeing the Storm more likely to encreaſe then to calm, I recollected my former Journall and Manuall notes of my Travails by Land and Sea forty years ſince in Italy, France, Germany, Poland, and Belgia, and finding Omne ſolum forti patria, ut piſcibus aequor; I peruſed all the books of any Engliſh Colonies, and by often conferences of the traders and reſident planters, of the preſent ſtate, condition, numbers, enemies, bad neighbours, aire, health government, fortification and ſaftety, religion, quietneſſe, profit, and returns, ſhipping for ſupplie and vent of the growing commodities; I conferred with my fellow patients, 7 Knights and Gentlemen, my kindred and neighbours, and reporting the true ſtate of all our Colonies; and whiles thus muſing I ſtood at a maze unreſolved, the ſtorm grew far more tempeſtuous with thunder and lightning, black and terrible guſts, and ſpouts, that made the rivers riſe, and my friends to hide: for the roaring Cannon beat down their wals and houſes, the Muſqueteers, Dragoons▪ and Piſtold horſemen ſwept all Cattell and their goods afore them; the Pikemen in their incloſures and retreats, left them no beds, pots or pans; their ſilver plate was turned into earthen diſhes: New names, and terms, like an unknown language, and like to ſtrange people unheard of in all the Globe as far as our Antipodes, called Cavalleers, Presbyters, Independents, Roundheads, and Malignants, like the Gothes, Huns,

and Vandalls, and Alans, that invaded and conquered Italy, Spaine, and France; and like the Saxons, Jutes, and Angles, that conquered Britanny. Theſe having plundered, and put upon us new Laws and Ordinances, called Contribution, Exciſe, Quartering, and Sequeſtrations, my friends were now and rightly by Gods Providence made light, and not troubled or incumbred with much ſtuffe to travel with, nor Farms, Tenements, or Copyholds, and for our ſins our pride abated, our hearts humbled: our afflictions made us pray heartily, and call to God to direct us to infuſe contrition and true ſorrow, and purpoſe of amendment to follow his calling. Wee found this ſtorm and heavy judgement had likewiſe afflicted Scotland, Ireland, Man, Jarſey, and Garaſey Iſles. Then peruſing my old evidences, I found my Aunceſtor Sir Richard Plantagenes had Chawton, Blendworth, Clanfield, and Catrington in Hampſhire. But in thoſe Civil-wars in Henry the ſixth time, much like theſe or that of the Guelfs and Gibellines in Italy, all was loſt. I reſolved to be a Newter in this quarrell, not to kill Engliſh men and Chriſtians, but with Chriſt to fly into Egypt, and like the Apoſtle Paul
