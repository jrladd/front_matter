RIght Honorable, &c. Two things have coacted and impulsed me to trouble your Honours, &c. with this rude Epistle: The one is an ardent desire I have not only to expresse my endeered affection to the honourable Society, but also my willingnesse (though uninvited, in coming to counsell before I am called, presuming

of your gracious pardon if not good acceptance) to manifest or make known unto you what my weak capacity conceiveth behoovefull for the welfare and indemnity of the honourable Company of India Merchants in their right worthy famous action of Commerce. The other is for vindication of my good name, never yet justly tainted) by declaration of the intollerable wrongs which I Richard Boothby, an honest poor member of the India Company, and your trusty servant, hath undergone both in India, by lewd, malicious, tyrannicall, fraudulent, jugling fellow-servants; and also at home, by partiall, injust, ingratefull, unconscionable, corrupt Governours, and timeserving Committees in the India Courts.
For your incouragements in that worthy action of Commerce, be pleased to conceive charitably and friendly of the opinion, or rather assured knowledge of a weak unintelligent Merchant, that the trade to and from India, & from port to port in the severall places of India, and other Kingdoms neer adjacent, is the most hopefull, beneficiall of any part of the world; wherein by Gods blessing, a competency (if not a superfluity) in estate is to be attained unto with small stock, in 4, 5, 6, or 7 yeares time; which 3 or 4 times so many yeares spent in other Countries, will not so suddenly supply with far greater stock. The danger of the trade by sea, especially in those oriental parts, is small, taking the opportunity and season of the yeare in the time of the favourable monsons, or trading winds, the seas so calm and pleasant, that from India to Persia, Bantum, Mocco, Madagascar, Mauritius, and other parts, the ships commonly tow their long Boats, Skiffes, and Barges at their Stern to and again; and by a voyage in three, foure, or five moneths time too and again, there may be gained, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80. and 100. per cent. profit, and more in severall sorts of commodities, according to the judgement and discretion of the intelligent Merchant, in making choyce of his commodity, and attaining it at the best hand.
Hereof I will not much insist, having more at large discoursed thereof in a rude pamphlet tending to incouragements to plant in Madagascar (which perhaps may hereafter come out in print) where I could wish my selfe and family securely (with others my Countreymen) seated in that most famous, pleasant, wholsome, fruitfull Island, as I suppose, transcending all others in the world, if my weak purse and decrepit unable body for travell, would permit.
The other cause moving me to this occasion for vindication of my good name, in manifestation of my wrongs, will be superfluous to insist upon in

this Epistle, for that the present declaration thereof hereunto annexed, will more at large demonstrate the same.
Be pleased, right honourable, &c. courteously to accept the admonishments & advertisements of an unintelligent Merchant (especially in matters that are not within his line, or beyond the reach of his apprehension) yet in some things I may peradventure say more by industrious observation and affectionate duty to your Honours Corporation, its welfare and indemnity, then others (it may be) either can or will.
In the first pla
•
e it were good at your generall Courts (especially at the election of your Governour, Deputy, Committees and Officers,) not to be absent to lend your votes in 
•
busing fitting persons thereunto, men fearing God, and hating covetousnesse (for by your absence and small appearance of late at such times, the time-serving Governour and Committees, are better fitted to band together, to continue in their places, or to elect new, such men as they either know or presume will be for their accommodation the one to the other, in their own privat ends.) And if at such election some pious Divine spend an hour, or lesse, in godly exhortations in a Sermon, to perswade to upright dealing between all parties, as well in the differences between the Court and their servants, or their servants one against another, as for their fidelity and industry in managing the main affairs, or joynt stock of the Company. It may not perhaps be accounted or found an irksome, needless, or impertinent matter to spend an houres time in such businesses, nor yet a superfluous charge, to gratifie a worthy Minister for his pains therein: For surely, the partiality, injustice, uncharitablenesse, and ingratitude of those Courts, have wrought much wrong and oppression to their best deserving servants, and caused connivance at their most wicked, lewd, fraudulent, and worst deserving servants, being blinded with their heaps of ill-gotten goods, by bribery, and bopes to match such ill-deserving men in marriage to their daughters.
In the next place I think it not amisse to put you in mind, that charge be given to those Courts, to make choyce of their India servants, men of good repute and credit in life and conversation, as well as of men of ability and understanding to manage their affairs, and that no lewd, debauched, illlivers, prodigall unthrifty persons, prophane swearers, drunkards, and lascivious persons, of which sort too many have been entertained, by favour and friendship in Court, even of their own sonnes, kindred or friends, and by letters from great men to pleasure them, (sent out as the phrase hath been, for

sacrifice, or by such voyages to reclaim them, which is rather the next way to thrust such persons into the Devils mouth, and to make them ten times worse then ere they were before) which turneth to the dishonour of God, the prejudice of the honourable Company, and their own souls hazard, countenanced by example of superionrs there, given to all excesse of ryot, and delighting to make others children of Belial as themselves.
Thirdly, it were better in my weak judgement, to make plain downright accord and covenant with their servants concerning private trade, rather then by indirect conniving thereat, to covenant with them for lesse salary, which they regard not in any comparison to their benefit by privat trading, (though they enter into large bonds to the contrary, which they know the Court never hath put in suit, nor ever will, as not effectuall by the lawes of the Land) which is as difficult a thing to reclaim in their servants, as for a hungred starved Cook to dresse curious dainty viands for a great Feast, and be bound under great penalty, not so much as to lick his fingers. But other plain covenants and agreements may be devised to the better contentment and accommodation of their servants and themselves, (as my self hath heretofore demonstrated my opinion more at large in the particulars to the India Court, which were too large to relate in an Epistle.
Fourthly, why should it not be as easie and facile a matter to them at home to make choyce of their President and Councell in India, as to make choyce of succeeding Captains, Masters of Ships, and Commanders at Sea by occasion of mortality: And in my opinion the same course they take in the one, may as well be observed in the other; and not to leave the choyce of succeeding places of eminency in India, to their servants own choyce, where greatnesse of power, hopes of favour and privat respects, will cause servants to vote one for another, though to the great prejudice of their Honorable Imployers, and the ruine of honest men in India, who are conscionable in their duties to God and to their Masters, whereby much disaster hath befallen in the Companies affaires, by the juglings and defraudments of deceitfull persons in chiefest places of eminency, and intollerable wrongs done even to their equals, for not running the same course, or not conniving thereat, as this plain Declaration will in part manifest. And its worthy the consideration of the Honorable Company, to endevour its reformation. For a wicked President, and his packed main part of Councell, can easily in India make malicious shew of great crimes fained to be committed, against an honest man, and to arraigne him, condemne him to prison, suspend the salary, and ship him home a delinquent,

before ever he make his purgation to the Court at home, and so he and all his are in possibility to be ruined unjustly. For it is no small matter of moment, considering the multitude of dangerous disasters that depend thereon, whereof for feare of discouragement to any undertaker in those adventurous imployments, I forbeare the relation, which I could manifest of dangerous consequence both at Sea and Land, for a man to make a long dangerous voyage to India, and without just cause to be dismissed from his fair fortunes to seeke redresse in partiall unjust India Courts at home, where corrupt Governors and Courts when they have voted the innocency of the party abused, and promised restitution of wrongs, shall yet unconscionahly for by respects, recall their former votes, and plead in the defence of the malignant parties. It's not for the accommodation of the honorable action of commerce to question the Presidents power and authority, but rather to defend it, (though never so wicked a tyrant;) nor for the honour of India Courts to be curious Inquisitors into the Presidents actions, (be they never so impious, fraudulent, or oppressfull.) And so long as such corrupt Courts at home are not reformed, it were better for an honest man so abused, to hang himselfe (were it not for the danger of his soule) then to undergo such wicked censures at home. In those India elections it is good to make choyce of pious Ministers, both for residency in India, and aboord your Shipping. The choyce of lewd men of that worthy function, hath done much hurt among your servants by their evill example, surpassing others in those lewd consuming sinnes of soule, body, and estate, Alea, Vina, Venus: Some of which have dishonored God, their nation and profession in a high degree, and made no conscience to leave their spurious bastards in India, to be bred up in Paganisme, and at ripe yeares to be had in esteem in regard of their whitenesse, by a lewd Christian bawd, to make a common harlot of.
Fifthly, it seems strange to me, that a government in India by a President and Councell, should be established by a privat Commission never seen to any in my time (or before or since) but to the President himselfe, who under colour of that power and authority, rules as a Tyrant, according to his own wicked disposition, Hoc volo, hoc jubeo; which whosoever shall question, is in danger ipso facto to be arraigned for his life as a trayter or mutiner: who having by usurpation crept into the place of Presidency, makes choyce of three more of Councell, whom he pleaseth, which he proudly calleth (His Councell,) like ambitious Cardinall Wolsey (Ego & Rex meus) And if but one of them stick close to him, whom he will be sure shall be a son

of Belial fit for his purpose: then in regard of his double voycc, he carries all consultations or acts of Court which way he pleaseth, against the other two, and they also must in the end of necessity comply, or else their own ruine shall shortly be effected. Therefore in my simple opinion, it were more just, that lesser power were in the President, and more in the Councell (as I heare it is since lately somewhat amended in that point, upon my complaint and abuse done unto me by such Wylde government. And me thinks it were not amisse that the Presidents and Councels Commission, were at least once a yeare read at a publick Assembly, both to Merchants and Sea-men, that all men may know how to render due obedience to superiors, nor the superiors to Lord it too much over their inferiors. And also why should not hereto be added good Lawes and Ordinances for directions on both sides, how to behave themselves in their duties to God, their loyalty to their Soveraigne, the welfare of their honorable imployers, and the peace, tranquillity, and love one towards another; which I leave to your Honours and Worships considerations.
I may not let passe one thing, which I conceive hath been a curse to your worthy designe, and caused no small disaster to betide to the Honorable action of Commerce, and that is a crying sinne of parents, wives, children and friends of your deceased and dead servants in India, by abusive wrong done to the estates of the defunct three sever all wayes: The first is in regard of their bonds and covenants formally yeelded unto, which never any have kept, nor ever any will observe: and because they will keep close their privat trade with all the secresie they can, they never keep Merchant-like accounts for fear of being seized upon by some malicious, tyrannous, or malevolent President, or others in authority, if they chance to do or say any thing that displeaseth them, so that in stead of formall fair accounts, they kept their reckonings in loose papers in their pockets, or bid in some private place, which at the end of every voyage out and home to any Port in India, they lacerate and dismember in peeces, trusting in their Banjan Brokers to be masters of their Ware-houses, or keepers of their goods and moneys. And if any of these servants die, (being loath to commit trust to their own countrey-men,) the Banjan defrauds their Executors of all or greatest part of their estates, and so perhaps if they trust some supposed friend their Countrey-men, they do the like; or else wanting time in thair extremity of sicknesse, cannot give their friend true information: And if they do, peradventure the Banjan and the supposed friend agree together and divide the estate into shares between

them. The second is, that if the President, or some authorized by him, find out any estate of the deceased, the goods are sold at an out-cry, and the moneys brought into the Companies Cash, for the benefit of the Executors. But the abuse therein is insupportable, as formerly in India Courts at home. For two or three, or more, will covenant together to buy them at under-rates, either by selling them by the lump in great parcels, that the meaner Merchant hath not means to pay for them; or if divided, the greater and more able persons, will threaten the underlings to sit on their skirts, or to doe them some mischief, if by bidding a higher price then they, they seek to buy them out of their hands: And this I have seen with my own eyes (with griefe,) but being a prisoner, could not prevent the mischiefe to the defunct, which otherwise I would have endeavoured to have remedied. The third abuse to the deceased servants estate, is acted by the Court Committees at home, and that is by defrauding the Executors of the deceased of the benefit of the exchange for their moneys brought into the Cash in India, which in my time was double money at home: for if any man bought of the deceaseds estate in India, and did not there make speedy payment, his covenant was to pay double money out of the salary at home, or otherwise as agreed upon: and my selfe have paid such exchange of double moneys abated out of my salary at home by the India Court, even for things bought, charitably to give away to poore men, having lost all their goods and necessaries in a ship fiered by Portugals, which for want of money, being a prisoner, and all my estate seized upon, I was contented to yeeld unto (as other men did,) rather then not to expresse a charitable affection to the indigent, according to my poore ability, or credit. Now the India Court think that they supererrogate in their charity, to pay the Executors of the defunct the principall, brought to their accounts in India, (though they make three, foure or five for one or more of their servants moneys;) and yet by that time the accounts are cleared, which happily may be six or twelve months, or longer time after the deceased have repaired from the remoter or furthest parts of the Kingdome, to seek after their deceased estate, sometimes (nay I doubt often) they have been forced to depart home, after great expence and charge, by waiting the Courts time to clear the accounts, with little or nothing, perhaps not enough to bear their charges down again. In some particulars of other mens, I could give bewailing intelligence of these passages; but I will instance onely in my own being living: then if the abuse be so great to the living, much more may the Executors of the deceased feel the burthen of these intollerable

defraudments. My selfe being eminent in India, and one of Councell, being maliciously arraigned for a delinquent, (as the ensuing story will relate) had my goods seized upon, and sold, volens nolens, before my face, at 40. per cent. l
•
sse of the principall, revengefully acted on purpose to make me a Bankrupt; (which maugre the Presidents Devillish malice, could not be effected) though he and his lewd favourite, notwithstanding their massie estates of twenty or thirty thousand pounds a man fraudulently gotten in India within six yeares time, or lesse, after their return from England, with all the super abundant favour the India Court could bestow upon them; yet were forced to take sanctuary in the Kings Bench and Fleet; and there, but for the tenor of a Statute of Bankrupts against them, would have defrauded their creditors also at home, (which brought them perforce to an under composition.) Again, my estate being seized upon, as before mentioned, among other goods I had two great and large faire Persia Carpets, fit for the Foot-stoole, or Chair of State of a Christian Prince, which would have covered the pavement or floore of about twenty foot square, or more, and cost me in Persia the first peny, about fourtie pounds. These it seems the ambitious President took for his own use, to the honour of his magnificencie, and never brought them, or their proceed, to the Companies account. For which demanding restitution, he put me off to the India Court, affirming that at his comming from India, be left them (for their use) in the Custome house at Surrat, and the Court denieth to give me any satisfaction for them, alledging that they were never brought to their account, and therefore not able to make them good, though the unjust Governour had voted before in Court, in favour of the jugling President, their meer hireling jugling servant, against their loyall brother servant, that it was not for the accommodation of their action of commerce, to wave or question their Presidents power and authority, but to support and maintain it; neithor for the honour of the India Court to be curious inquisitors into their Presidents actions; which is so horrible and detestable an ignominy to the honour of the India Society to defend, that that Honorable action of Commerce, could not be supported, but by fraud, oppression, tyranny, imprisonment, bonds, and the like, and murder too, if occasion so fell out: And so farre these Governours are from accusing consciences in such practices, that they take it to be an honour for them so to doe. But I have not yet done, I must further instance in more particulars in my own behalfe. At my departure from India, (a prisoner) I left in the hands of a succeeding President, a Trunk of rich

apparrell, good books, Divine and History, and other necessaries, which at an easie rate I valued at fourscore pound; and had I staid in India, would not have taken halfe as much more money for them. And these goods it seems were sold at an out-cry (according to my former relation of such practises) for 32 l. and no account to be given to whom they were sold, nor any particular of any thing how sold, but all in lump at 32 l. which money being brought into the Companies Cash, and three or foure yeares after comming to account with the Court, they were so farre dishonest, as not onely to deny me the exchange for my money, but also to keep back the principall, being part of 1200. l. they are yet indebted unto me. Yet once more: My wife sent me out of England, a Token (to me of great esteeme) viz. her own and all her three childrens pictures in one fair Map, or Table, to the full proportion of every one. That honest well reputed Gentleman of the India Court, and my especiall kind friend, Captain James Slade, took upon him to bring it (by Gods blessing) in safety to my possession: But before his arrivall, I was shipt home unjustly (a malefactor.) At the arrivall of the Fleet in India, whereof Captain Slade was Admirall in the ship Discovery. Great enquiry was made by the present President, for things of rarity, to be bought and bestowed upon the Sultan, or Govervour of Surrat: but in all the Fleet, none was found of greater esteem, then my wife and childrens pictures; which the President having intelligence of, sent to Captain Slade, to bring the same aboord the ship Charles, chiefe Admirall in the Port, to be viewed there by President and Councell. At which consultation it was decreed, that my pictures should be bought at good valuable rate, and to have credit for the same in the Companies books of accounts. And so the pictures were detained aboord the Charles, till order could be taken for their safe transport to Surrat. But the next day the ship Charles being fired by shooting of Guns at drunken healths (a detestable abuse and dammage to the honorable Company) the ship and all things within her, were burnt, and my pictures consumed. At the India Court (upon intelligence and certificate under Captain Slades hand, and his brothers, Mr. William Slade, Purser of the ship, and also of Mr. Nathanael Mountney, second of Councell to the President) I demanded restitution for my wife and childrens pictures, and tokens; but most dishonestly denied, saying, that in regard they were burnt, they were not liable to make them good unto me. These abuses are, as I am able to prove, to my dammage 500. l. And if such persons expect honour for acting and supporting fraud, robbery, envie, malice, and cruel oppression,

to the ruine of a whole Family, one of their own Corporation, and living, what can be expected but far worse from them to the dead (meere hirelings, no way alied by Corporation, Adventure, or otherwise among them.) But surely, if I be not partiall in my own cause, I conceive they merit such honour as Haman had for intending the ruine of a whole Nation, yet strangers in blood and religion unto him.
There be many other things besides these mentioned at present, that require your Honours, &c. reformation (if you expect a blessing from God upon your adventures, which may well be conceived that such abuses and crying sinnes have hitherto brought a curse upon that so worthy honorable action of Commerce) and upon examination will be brought to light; as this for one more; The India President usurps the power to fine men at his pleasure for delinquency, as he pleaseth maliciously to conceive against any: and those whom he envies and malignes, shall have heavy fines set upon them, which he knowes the Court at home will not remit, having their estates in possession: for all is fish that comes to their net, unlesse in favour to a Minion, or some chief in Court. And this cost an eminent Merchant in India, and at present in London, 500. l. though he brought certificates out of India to clear him from all aspersion cast upon him, (and to try a suit in Law with them, is to no purpose, for they boast they will be too mighty for any to withstand them, having a common rich purse against a privat poore one, to manage their unjust designes.) Likewise, if the offender be his favourite, or hath a good purse to bribe, his Fine shall be made easie to prevent a heavier punishment at home, (as unconscionable to be questioned or arriagned twice for one thing, censure being formerly past upon him.) I could instance somwhat in this point in the case of life and death, but I am more charitably minded then to cast aspersion upon any, having undergone (at least) a formall triall for his life.
One thing more, right honourable, &c. be pleased to give me leave to admonish you of, Your honourable action of Commerce is like in time to suffer much, if you follow not the example of the Portugals, Dutch, and Danes, by strenthening your selves by some accommodable plantation neer India, both for a refuge for your shipping, and strengthening thereof; and also to fetch off your servants in India, upon wrong offered them by tyrannicall heathenish Moores: A tast whereof you have had heretofore by imprisoning your chiefe and all other servants, and threatned with drubbing and chawbucking, and your Christian adversaries in that action will (for want thereof)

dominier too much over you: And the best place for you to settle a plantation, is (in my conceit) at Madagascar, where if you set not foot in speedily, others of our nation, who (by report) have made entrance thereinto, may peradventure defeat you, and wring your charter from you for your neglect to the good of this Republick. This business I leave to your wiser considerations, and to such incouragements in that business, as lately I have in my weak capacity, conceived behoovefull, which may peradventure hereafter (if not with this) come out in print to the publick view.
Yet I may not omit to put you in mind, that you make better choyce of your Governours and Court Committees at home, and that (good part or greater at least) out of men well qualified, and of good report, bred up in India, rather then Shop-keepers, or ignorant Merchants, some of which were never further at Sea, then aboord your brave ships in the Downs a feasting. For though some such men may be vertuous and well qualified for their breeding, and by long continuance in their places of Committee, have gotten good experience, yet they have only the theorick, and are too short in the pracktick, and both are necessary, as by inlargement I could give better testimony. I conceive some men may object, I say thus much to insinuate my selfe, to get into place of Committee; which I am so far from the thought or desire, that I should more willingly accept of a poore pension from the Company, or to be an Alms-man in their Hospitall at Blackwall, which I am able to prove I have well deserved, even for my good endeavours to that charitable work.
Thus, right Honorable, right Worshipfull, and others, a faithfull loving member of your worthy Corporation, being ruined in estate, by partiall, uncharitable, unjust, corrupt Governours, and time-serving Committees in your India Courts, and being at present, lame, inmpotent, diseased, and in a manner bed-ridden, and already halfe in his grave, yet hath indevoured, not without great pain, to manifest his zealous affection to your Honours, &c. welfare and indemnity, which he hath been the rather induced unto, being deprived of all means to doe you service in India, as a servant or friendly accommodation upon his own adventure (wherein his duty as a member of the Company, should not have been wanting.
To which imployment my affection hath been so addicted, as I think never any mans that was banisht his native country, hath been m
•
re desirous to return thither again, then mine hath to revisit India: But now having lost all my fortunes, hopes and limbs, and ready for the grave, (when God shall be pleased to fit me for my dissolution) I humbly intreat your Honours, &c.

to accept of my honest, loyall affectionate intents, (in this tedious Epistle, though I want not matter to inlarge to a farre greater volume,) in as good part as it is presented unto you. And if it please your Honours, &c. out of your grace and goodnesse, to take into consideration the distressed estate of your true, loyall servant, so much abused, wronged, aad oppressed, abroad and at home, to cause restitution for the same, from your Honours, &c. substitutes and servants, the chiefe delinquents, wrongers and oppressors, or out of the generall stock, as to your Honours, &c. shall seem most agreeable to justice, charity, and repute of the honorable India Corporation (which is the most humble petition of your late industrious loyall Servant, I doubt not but thereby you shall doe a businesse pleasing to God, acceptable to the Honourable high Court of Parliament, (to ease them in righting privat mens wrongs, to the better furtherance of the weighty affairs of the Republick, more considerable:) For which your Honours, &c. most humble impotent Petitioner, and all his distressed Family, shall ever pray for your Honours, &c. temporall and eternall felicity.
