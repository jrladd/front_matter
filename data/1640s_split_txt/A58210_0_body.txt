Right Honourable,


THe reason why I adventure this Sermon to the publique view, is because I understand, it was, in the

delivery, mistaken by some hearers, whose second thoughts, I am confident, upon their better scanning it, will bee more charitable: my whole scope being to perswade to an holy unity in Christ, which every sonne of peace wisheth with meâ–ª Our present necessity may satisfie a considering man, why I put it under the Sanctuary of both your names, one being our Judge and interpreter of the Lawes, and the other one of the law-makers in the most honorable high court of Parliament: seeing wee now want both good lawes, & right interpretation of the same, for the suppressing the disturbers of the Churches peace, and for the setling of an happy

unity: to which I onely adde the hearty prayers for the good successe of your prudent endeavours and the humble tender of the love and service of
