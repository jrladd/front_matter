Madam,


I
 Have read that a poor and mean Lamp of a great Philosopher, hath been sold at a great price; And I have seen a Medail,

which in the intrinseck value was worth little, sold at a great rate, because it had the Name and Image of some great Person stampt upon it. I therefore that I may gain an extrinseque value to this Book, have presumed to dedicate it unto you, Madam, in hope that your Noblenesse and gentlenesse is as great as your Beauty, which delighteth and causeth admiration in the eyes of all, but those of the envious: And that you will in the permission of your Name to be set before this Book, imitate the custome of Kings, who set their Names on coines of Copper, as well as on those of Gold; and as the King that coines, sets what value hee pleaseth on his

Money; so when your name is set to his Work, I will give it what price 
〈…〉
 please, and every wise person will 
•…
uy it.
