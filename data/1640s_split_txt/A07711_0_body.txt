SIR,




•

 Have found you ſo Noble in the firſt Dedication, that I ſhould much derogate from your true Worth, and wrong my ſelfe to make choiſe of a new Patron

for the ſecond (exactly done with applauſe) wherein though I preſume, yet perſume, t'will bee no ſinne to multiply my obligation. Your name, and nature, claimes, and deſerves it, 'tis your due and my duty, and were I able to expreſſe more MOORE ſhould have it, for I muſt alwayes acknowledge your goodneſſe in whatſoever quality for tune ſhall beſtow me. SIR, I know you are wiſe. In a word I am, really what I am.
