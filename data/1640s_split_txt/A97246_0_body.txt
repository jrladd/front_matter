COurteous Reader,

The diſeaſe to which this Cure is applyed, is epidemicall. The hearts of men beeing anatomized, it will bee found, that the grand cauſe of their alienation from, and oppoſition unto the waies of God: is a ſecret obſtruction, ariſing from that which as the ſeed of it, the Author calls Miſpriſion. This Book deſcribes the diſeaſe very lively, in the

Symptomes of it, and preſcribes the Cure in a very artificiall method; laid downe in great variety of matter, and elegancy of conveyance. The receipt is made up of well choſen ingredients: ſtrong, and therefore likely to be operative; ſweet, & thereby inviting the patient to take it. If the Jaundies be removed out of thy eye wherby the things of God have been repreſented to thee in a falſe colour: Let the chief Phyſitian have all the glory of thy recovery, which is all the reward the confectioner expects for his paines.
