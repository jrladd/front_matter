THe knowledge of your growing virtues, have begot in all men love, in me admiration, and a desire to serve the manifold obligations I have to the true Example of worth Captaine Endemion Porter, instructed me to this presentation of my devoted respects to your noble selves, the true Ideas of his virtues. You are so equall in all the attributes of goodnesse, that it were a difficult indeavor for mee to distinguish betweene your perfections: Onely noble Captaine that prioraty which your birth has allowed you, ingages me in the first place to tender my service to your selfe, which I imagin'd could not have beene really accomplish'd, had I not joynd your brother in this act of my gratitude to you. Accept therefore heroicke paire of brothers, this tender of his best devotionsâ–ª to you who has no greater ambition then to be esteemed,
