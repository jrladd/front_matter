I Shall not here Sir, poliſh or repeat
The ſtory of your worth, nor tell how great
You are in goodneſſe as in fame; how immenſe
In your mindes faire Republique; how propenſe
Indulgent nature hath been of her ſtore,
By enriching you, thus to make others poore:
Theſe as eſſentiall Truths, I might infer,
From each Comma raiſe your Character;
But theſe ſoft layes I leave to ſuch ſoft wits
Who teach their Muſe the trade of Paraſits,
To bombaſt eaſie greatneſſe with, and pleaſe
Their pampared Patrons with Hyperboles.

My Muſe weares no ſuch maſque, nor can her Rime
Lackey or hold opinion with the time.
Invited hither to performe that due
Tribute of thankes ſhe owes, and owes to you;
To you beſt Sir, who have a witneſſe been
Of what ſhe writes, to you Sir, who have ſeene
Thoſe Tragedies ſhe treates of, and have knowne
The loſſes of great Ulſter in your owne.
Then ſince ſhe's thus aſpired, ſhe humbly prayes
To let her Ivie waite upon your Bayes.
