SIR,


THe Interpretation of Dreames is of the ſame Originall and Extent, as is the inſpiration or Divine Vertue by which they are infuſed. That God appeared in Dreams and in the Viſions of the night, the ſacred Text doth plentifully teſtifie▪ And that GOD unto ſome ſelected

men, by a peculiar ſpirit, did give the perfect knowledge of the Interpretation of Dreams; the ſame Divine Truth doth give remarkable demonſtrations. I need not to declare unto you the admirable guifts of Joſeph, almoſt in the firſt Age of the world; and of the Prophet Daniel in the ſecond. Their Interpretations in thoſe dayes of the Dreames of the Egyptian and Aſſyrian Monnrchy, do ſufficiently declare the praeſcience of their ſpirits, and how near of kinne they were to God, Our Author being a Philoſopher, and working onely by ſecond cauſes, by the light of Nature; had not that happy intereſt to be ſo immediately, ſo divinely inſpired.

I have the rather been induced to devote this Book unto you, becauſe your Candor to the Arts, and excellent Experience in the great and choiſe affairs of Peace and Warre, is of a wide Latitude, and not to be confined within the Engliſh bounds. Your Experience beyond the Seas, doth ſufficiently declare your worth, both when you travelled firſt by your ſelf, and when being Major Domo, you afterwards took with

you (the lively image of your ſelf) your moſt noble and hopefull Son; whoſe underſtanding in the knowledges both Polemicall and Politicall you increaſed by foraign obſervations, and admirably inlightned it by your own example. According to your nobleneſſe, in this tempeſt of Warre receive this Preſent of the Arts, and be pleaſed to protect revived Artimedorus: And alſo, (though the Subiect be of Dreams) to excuſe his zeale, who will ever be awake to expreſſe himſelfe to be
