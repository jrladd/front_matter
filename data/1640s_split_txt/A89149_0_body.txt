IT is not any private reſpect of gain, Gentle Reader, for the ſlighteſt Pamphlet is now adayes more vendible then the Works of learnedeſt men; but it is the love I have to our own Language that hath made me diligent to collect, and ſet forth

ſuch Peeces both in Proſe and Vers, as may renew the wonted honour and eſteem of our Engliſh tongue: and it's the worth of theſe both Engliſh and Latin Poems, not the flouriſh of any prefixed encomions that can invite thee to buy them, though theſe are not without the higheſt Commendations and Applauſe of the learnedſt Academicks, both domeſtick and forrein: And amongst thoſe of our own Countrey, the unparallel'd atteſtation of that renowned Provost of Eaton, Sir Henry Wootton: I know not thy palat how it reliſhes ſuch dainties, nor how harmonious thy

ſoul is; perhaps more trivial Airs may pleaſe thee better. But howſoever thy opinion is ſpent upon theſe, that incouragement I have already received from the moſt ingenious men in their clear and courteous entertainment of Mr. Wallers late choice Peeces, hath once more made me adventure into the World, preſenting it with theſe ever-green, and not to be blaſted Laurels. The Authors more peculiar excellency in theſe ſtudies, was too well known to conceal his Papers, or to keep me from attempting to ſollicit them from him. Let the event guide it ſelf which way it will, I ſhall deſerve

of the age, by bringing into the Light as true a Birth, as the Muſes have brought forth ſince our famous Spencer wrote; whoſe Poems in theſe Engliſh ones are as rarely imitated, as ſweetly excell'd. Reader if thou art Eagle-eied to cenſure their worth, I am not fearful to expoſe them to thy exacteſt peruſal.
