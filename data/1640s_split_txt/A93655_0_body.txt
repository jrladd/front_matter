Noble SIR,



S
Ʋppoſing you may take the
Book called the Vindication
by Master Prynne into your
hand, I deſire that this Diſcourſe
may be in your other
hand, as occaſion ſerves. If
the Lord hath revealed any thing in this Diſcourſe,
to enlighten the darkneſſe of this preſent
Controverſie, it is onely from him who
is the Father of Lights, who carries on his
to a more excellent way, till we may with
open face, behold the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt,
and be changed from glory to glory.


Sir, The thing I onely contend for, is, that
which the Goſpel and Spirit calls for;
Whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever
things are honeſt, whatſoever things are of
good report.
Sir, The ingagement of private reſpects
which are upon me towards you; and being
likewiſe a partaker of ſome labours of yours in
the Lord, which are abroad, as that of Promiſes,
&c. The beſt treaſure we have in
this life, hath drawn this from me.
The Lord who hath wounded you, binde
you up, and lead you on to the glorious Truths;
for, if I mistake not, our Controverſie is but
this in theſe times; ſome would walk more
cloſe with Chriſt, ſome can be content like
Peter to walk at more distance, and follow him
afar off, and to ſtand warming themſelves with
the multitude in the Common-Hall: And
let the Word judge betwixt us, which is of
beſt report.


Sir,
Yours in the things of
Jeſus Chriſt,
