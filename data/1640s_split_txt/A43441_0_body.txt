WEll may my Book come forth like Publique Day,
When such a Light as You are leads the way:
Who are my Works Creator, and alone
The Flame of it, and the Expansion.

And look how all those heavenly Lamps acquire

Light from the Sun, that inexhausted Fire:

So all my Morne, and Evening Stars from You
Have their Existence, and their Influence too.
Full is my Book of Glories; but all These
By You become Immortall Substances.
