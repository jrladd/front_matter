SIRS,

MAy it please you, The
Scottish King being
imprisoned in Mortimers
hole, comforted himself
and deceived the sorrowes
of his bondage, by scraping



the Story of Christ crucified
upon the wals, with his
nailes: Even so God writeth
the lawes, and dictates of
Conscience upon a wall, the
wall of Conscience, Murus
aheneus; so as all the rules
of Divinity, of nature, of
nations, and of positive
lawes, as they relate to Conscience,
are like the handwriting,
Dan. 5. herbae Parietariae,
wall-flowers. And
they are written and sculptured
with a naile too; but a
more stiffe and potent naile
then that of the Scottish
King. Judge not ex ungue,
&c. but by a retrograde
crisis, judge the naile by the
finger, which is expresly called



digitus Dei, Exod. 31. 18.
and what can the naile of
such a finger be, but unguis
adamantinus, as it is adjuncted,
Jer. 17. 1? and need it
hath to be no lesse, unlesse
the pen be more soft then the
paper: for if our hearts be
hearts of adamant, Zech.
7. 12. then the stile that
writes characters upon them
had need be a pen of iron,
and the naile of an Adamant.
I present here your Worthinesses
with a booke; a
booke, as St Bernard ingeniously,
for the rectifying
whereof, all other bookes are
written; I except not the



very Booke of bookes it self.
For there are foure Bookes
written by God, for the sons
of men, which are thus to be
classed and ordered. They
are either the Bookes of
Grace, or of Nature. The
Bookes of Grace are either
outwar
â€¢
 or inward. The outward
Booke of Grace is the
holy Bible. The inward Book
of Grace is the holy Spirit,
the great Doctor of the
Church. The outward booke
of nature is the world, or book
of the Creatures, which is
God unfolded. The inward
Booke of nature is this
very booke, whose seales I
have, in the ensuing Tra
