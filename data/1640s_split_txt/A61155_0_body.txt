Right Honourable,


THe ſeverall pieces thus rallied, were never writ in my own power, or appointment, but I had commonly ſome juncture of Providence, and ſomething of a Spirit not my own upon me; for I obſerved I could not write when I would, my Springes, were not in me, nor could I end when I would, till I had finiſhed this Teſtimony, and for ſomething of God here, I am ſure, there is enough of man, of my ſelfe; Thus is Gods appearing while we are in the Body, he was in Christs which had no ſin, but he is not ſo in ours which are full of ſin.

I have ſome few things to ſay, and they ars

things of duty from me, and of truth to you; that God hath filled the ſtory of your life with himſelfe, with his Power, Wiſdome, and Love, and all that he may be your fulneſſe, and that you would glory in the Lord: Let me remind you how you have ſeen him from Leedes to Bradfoorth, to Wetherby, to York, to Hull, even from Yorkeſhire to Lincolneſhire, from thence to Naſeby, and ſo through the Conqueſt of Cities, Towns, Caſtles, through ſo much almoſt as a Kingdom comes to. And now after all this enter into your reſt, even the love of God, the Son of God, and there refreſh your ſelfe in his light, in his glory, in the boſome of his love, there are pleaſures for evermore; this is a piece of your courſeſt worke, to beare the Sword for him who is the Power of God upon Earth, for the puniſhment of evill doers in the world, the more glorious worke is your Spirituall, where Principalities and Rulers, and Spirituall wickedneſſe in high places, fleſh and bloud are all againſt you, and yet you above them all, in him, through whom you are more than Conquerour, even him that loved you.



Sir, Let it be not your buſines only to Conquer as a man, but as a Saint, not as a Souldier, but as a Chriſtian, not in the ſpirit of man but of God. Let not a ſin, a luſt, a temptation ſtand more before you in the body, then an enemy in the field: gird on your ſpirituall Armour, your Shield of faith, your breſtplate of righteouſneſſe, your Sword of the Spirit, your Helmet of Salvation, and put on your white lining, which is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints, and follow him who rides on the white Horſe, in a veſture dipt in the bloud of his ſufferings, whoſe name is the Word of God, and tell me if ever there was Glory like unto this Glory.

I cannot reckon the mighty men of valour in the world, any thing but a worldly glory, which if it dyed not with them, or ſome ages after them, yet can live no longer than the life of the world, all theſe things are periſhing; but to be a man of the holy Spirit, a man borne of God, a man that wars not after the fleſh, a man of the Kingdom of God, as well as of England: Thus you ſhall live beyond time, and age, and men, and the world; gathered up into the life which is Eternall, and was with the Father.



Sir, Your dwelling now is much in the ſhadow of death, and amongſt the Graves, and therefore ſo live in Chriſt your life, that you may have one life more then men can kill; men can only kill the man, not the Christian.


Sir, I will not praiſe you, but bleſſe God for you, and his Image in you, this will make great men love God, and not themſelves; to ſpeake of them as his, not as their own.

Now Sir, ſo warre, that you may be ſtill a man of peace in the midſt of battell, and of compaſſions in the midſt of ſufferings, never wearing your Laurell without ſome Olive, that all may know when you act as a Magiſtrate, and as your ſelfe, when you act from power, or when from love, from Juſtice, or when from mercy.

So love, as you may love God and Christ in men, more then men, and the Spirit in any more then the Forme either of Presbytery or Independency.

Thus Brethren who can now ſcarcely love one another becauſe of that, ſhall love you, and ſhall learne to love one another from you,


Noble Sir,
