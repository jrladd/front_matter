SIR,


IT is above thirty yeeres ſince the Lord hath brought mee to be an inhabitant of Woolchurch; And for the greattr part of this time, the providence of God hath ſo ordered it, that I have enjoyed your acquaintance, which hath been profitable, both to the outward and inward man, although of late, by reaſon of your great and high imployments for God and man, there hath not been that perſonall ſociety as heretofore; yet I often ſee you to participate in the beſt and excellent places of ſound Doctrine, in the way of truth and ſalvation, which with the knowledge I have of you, hath often moved my heart and ſpirit, to ſupplicate the God of heaven for you, as for my ſelf, to whom it hath pleaſed God to make his Truth ſo known, as to make mee a childe of it above twenty

yeeres ſince, which heavenly Principles had I ſo heeded and improved as I ought, I might have been by this time a ſtrong man in Chriſt Jeſus. How ever, Sir, I muſt confeſſe to you, Gods mercies have been more and abundantly greater then my own miſeries; and notwithſtanding mine own naturall indiſpoſition and unaptneſſe to the good and ſtreight way of the Lord; yet hee hath ſo magnified his good will and compaſsion, as thereby to make mee one, though the leaſt of his Diſciples, who therefore cannot, nay dare not, but ſpeak the things I have ſeen and learned of him, notwithſtanding the Croſſe and perſecution that attend on the obeying and declaring the truth, a part whereof you may ſee, if you pleaſe to take view of theſe few enſuing lines, where you may obſerve, that the teſtifying to the abundant mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt manifeſted in the Sacrament, as in the Word, even for this, many are offended and riſe up againſt mee, and do as much as in them lies, to make the world believe, that though they know me, yet they know me not; ſo as that I am ſeen, and not diſcerned: and yet I fear not for to ſpeak, though I care not to be known, except to you and the whole houſhold of faith, to whom the Lord continue his love and goodneſſe, which ſhall be ever the prayer of him, who is truly yours and theirs,
