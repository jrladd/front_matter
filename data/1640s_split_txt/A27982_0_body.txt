SIR,

I Preſume to invite you to theſe ſacred Nuptials: the Epithalamium ſung by a crowned Muſe. Never was there Paire of ſo divine a Beautie, nor united in ſuch harmonious Affections: and infinitely he deſerved her love; redeemed at ſo dear a Price, and inricht with ſo invaluable a Dowry.
SIR, Let me finde your Pardon for thus long continuing to make my Allay currant by the impreſsion of your Name. Directed by your propitious Aſpect, have I ſafely ſteered between ſo many Rocks; and now, arrived at my laſt Harbor, have broken up my ruinous Veſſell.
