Right Honourable and Right Worſhipfull:


THe many deepe tyes and faſt-binding
Ligaments of obliged Gratitude,
which have long time tied me in all
ſincere obſervances to both your
good Ladyſhips; doe extraordinarily

then (Right Honourable and Right Worſhipfull) I humbly
pray you, this ſmall Symboll and true Testimonie of my
moſt gratefull heart, and ever, every way, bounden best
ſervices (for many moſt immerited ſweet favours) truly
and duly devoted to both your good Ladyſhips. Which
ſingular favour and accuſtomed Chriſtian Candour will
(and that moſt meritoriouſly) extraordinarily add unto,
and mightily augment the, already, deep endeerments
