an humble ſute for your prudent conſideration
of the ſequele. For if I have
rightly collected; the opinion contended
with, repreſents you all guilty of
Schiſme againſt the Catholicke Church;
yea and of a higher crime, ſo many of

materiall points of Reformation; not onely without
the Authority or endeavouring to have the minde
of the Catholicke Church; but have alſo concluded
and eſtablished contrary to what it hath determined in all
thoſe Aſſemblies which our Brethren ſtile the Repreſentatives
of it.General Councells. From which tranſgreſſion the truth here

and propound it as a ground thereof; but that it should alſo

be conſtituted and eſtablished an ARTICLE of FAITH and
Confeſſion thereof; I crave leave to adde a ſupplication,
and with all ſubmiſſion, doe beſeech you, that the expedient
of a great man about theſe affaires, in his advice for
the reſtoring of peace in the Church may be diligently
weighed:Era

The ſumme (ſaith he) of our Religion is peace
and unanimitie;
Summa Religionis noſtri, pax eſt & unanimitas, ea vix conſtare poterit, niſi de quam poteſt pauciſſimis definiamus, & in multis literum relinquamus ſuum cuique judicium, propterea quod nigens ſit rerum plurimarum obſcuritas, &c.
