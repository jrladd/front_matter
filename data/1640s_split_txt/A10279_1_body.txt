GEentlemen,
Matter is better
than words.
If you bee noble,
worthy, and ingenuous,
theſe many precipitations
I here diſcover, need no
other effect than honeſt pity:
but if theſe endowments

of the minde bee excluded,
either by the raſhneſſe
of Youth (an ill Tutour);
or by violent prodigality
and licentiouſneſſe,
(a worſe Diſciple); My
deſire is, that my ſerious
lightneſſe, may arrow-like
pierce your Conſciences, to
an unfained repentance.
The more you are contriſtate,
the leſſe will be your
ſorrow; for to lament, is
here to rejoyce: and ſuch
joy I wiſh may be accumulated
on you, and on all

thoſe, that either love
goodneſſe, or are estranged
from it. The reaſon why I
preſent this Booke in chiefe
to you (after the intereſſed
Dedication) is, becauſe
being my ſelfe, of one of
your Societies, my obſervation
and experiment hath
made mee conjecture, that
theſe two ſhould never bee
unwelcome, Advice and
Delight. The first whereof,
if my Booke doe not
instruct, yet mine owne
deviation (ſtill knowne to

many) may, ſeeing there is
no ſtability in bubbling
pleaſure, nor no true content
without a religious returne;
ſo you have both
precept and example. And
as for the latter, it is better
wiſht than deſcribed.
Reade and judge.
