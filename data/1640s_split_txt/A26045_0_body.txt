ALbeit (Right Worſhipfull) there be more eſſential natures contained in each part both of this Macrocoſme, and Microcoſme, exiſting in their abſolute being, than the underſtanding of man can fully apprehend; yet I doubt not, but thoſe which may with labour and diligence be known, & thoſe alſo which of ingenious ſpirits and notable wits have been invented, and by them artificially & methodically taught, (tending not onely to manifeſt profit in

the Common-wealth, but alſo to the great increaſe and ſetting forth of Gods divine power, wiſdome, goodneſſe, providence, and increaſe of Virtue ought of all men to be imbraced, (and eſpecially of thoſe which have any government, publike charge, or authority in the Common wealth.) In regard that the neerer men approach to ſuch excellent Vertues, the neerer (without doubt) do they come unto goodneſſe, to felicyty, and to God himſelfe. Hence ſaith the Prophet (unto men ſeated in eminent places) Dixi vos dii eſtis, ſo that thoſe which either through arrogance, or ignorance deride, and contemne thoſe Arts (which with great dexterity, care, and induſtry have bin found out, and left unto us by the love of our Predeceſſors) doe both offer contempt unto the goodneſſe of God, and do much endamage and anoy all humane ſociety. So on the contrary part, they that do by all means further

thoſe ſo profitable Diſciplines doe both render true honour unto GOD, and do greatly advance the good of the Common-wealth wherin they live. Now in regard there is no ſtudy (Divinitie excepted) wherein the wit of man may be better employed then in the motion of the ſtars, and in the knowledge of their ſituation, place, and being, together with their wonderfull effects: In regard wherof I was incited to imploy ſome of my time in the ſtudy therof, and at laſt conſidering that of the Orator, that Non ſolum nobis nati ſumus, &c. We are not born for our ſelves onely, but our friends challenge a part in us, and our Countries come in for a ſhare, eſpecially thoſe honours and graces of our Countrey, thoſe that traffique in the deepe, and have their buſineſſe in the great waters, thoſe that are unto this Iſland as a woodden wall, the Sea-chariots, and the horſes of England: theſe, I ſay, may claime

juſtly to the fruits of our labours, whatſoever they be which have not altogether been abhorrent from the Mathematicall ſtudies: conſidering this, I could do no leſſe than bring in this my mite into their treaſury, and Si quid Ars mea efficere poſsit, (if my skill can ſtand them in any ſtead) to further that ſo much deſerving Science of Navigation. Accept therefore, I beſeech you, this yong ſonne of my ſtudies, this little handfull of paper, wherin is contained not Anacreons wanton Odes, or Ovids laſcivious Elegies, the incendiaries of luſt, but a pure ſpark of chaſt Veſtalfire, a ſmall part of the Mathematicks dedicated from a ſerviceable affection to your VVorſhips, that under the ſhield of your protections it may live ſecure, from the deſperate ſtab of of criticall perſons, and envious ſpirits, who not onely like ſnarling Satyres deride and contemne thoſe ſo liberall Sciences, but

ſwallow up with deſpite (if it were poſſible) the profeſſours thereof. For reſcue from ſuch malignant ſpirits my Book flies to the ſhadow of your favour, which if you ſhall afford unto it, my labours ſhall be all ſacrificed unto you, and I reſt.
