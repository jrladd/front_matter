Honoured Madam,



I
 Have obſerved your Ladiſhip carefull in two things: to improve the duty commanded in the Law, and to imbrace the promiſe tendered in the Goſpel; the former hath been a ſpurre to holineſſe, the latter a curb to unbeliefe. The conſideration of this (together with the remembrance of thoſe manifold favours which your Ladiſhip hath plentifully vouchſafed to me and mine) hath provoked me to dedicate this Treatiſe unto you, which although it hath much controverſall matter in it, yet it is not without many practicall Directions and Conſolations. It hath been Gods goodneſſe unto you, that although in theſe times of calamities your portion hath been one of the afflictions in Paul's

Catalogue, without ſettled aboad; yet God hath leſt your minde fixed and immoveable in the truth, being enabled to 

〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

 magnifie Grace in the highest manner, out of the reall ſenſe of your neceſsity and unworthineſſe, yet to avoid Antinomianiſme: and on the other ſide, to be punctuall and exact in the duties of mortification and holineſſe; yet to take heed of Phariſaicall Popery. And indeed, this is the right ſenſe, when we are ſo diligent in working out our ſalvation with feare and trembling, as if there were no grace to justifie; and yet ſo resting and beleeving in the grace of Christ, as if no good thing had been done by us.
Madam, goe on with the aſsistance of God, and account the things of grace more excellent then the things of parts; and while others rejoyce in opinions, and new notions about faith and holineſſe, doe you delight in the things themſelves. The Lord keep his best wine for you in the later end of your age, and give you to ſee the fruit of your Prayers, a ſettled reformation in the Church, that ſo (when your time ſhall come) you may depart in peace, feeling much of the power and love of God living, and much more of them, dying.

Madam, 
this is the prayer of
