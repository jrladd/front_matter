WORTHY, and vertuous young Gentlewomen: My Penne for your ſpirituall good, is willing in theſe enſuing leaues, to ſpread it ſelfe. You are all Catholikes in Fayth and profeſſion, and therefore the more apt to receaue (if ſo Gods Grace be not wanting) the impreſſion of the Aduice & Coū
ſel, which in this Treatiſe is giuen.
My mayne proiect at this preſent

is, ſince you all (to whom I wryte) as yet remayne in your Chaſt and Virginall ſtate, & free from Mariage, to perſwade you (what in me lyeth) to abandone this Wicked World, and to imbrace a Votary and Religious life. A hard labour (no doubt) in your iudgments, but facile and eaſy to ſuch of you, who haue a feeling, & true apprehenſion of the ioyes of Heauen, and torments of Hell.
I do not ſpeake this, as if one in a maried ſtate could not arryue to Heauen, and auoyde Hell. Noe, God forbid; For I acknowledg with the Apoſtle, 
Hebr. 13.
Mariage to be honourable, but withall I hould Virginity to be more honourable. I here only propound the moſt ſecure way to come to Heauen, and eſcape Hell. And here I demand, if any of You were married, and after the death of your husbands,

were to enioy a great, and rich Ioynture, of a thouſand, or two thouſand pounds yearely; would you not be deſirous, that beſydes the common Courſe of making Ioyntures (which perhaps might be ſubiect to ſome danger) to take (by your learned Counſell) the beſt meanes for the ratifying and better ſecuring of your Right to your ſaid Ioynture? I know, you would be moſt ſolicitous herein.
