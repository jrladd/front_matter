RIGHT WORSHIPFVL,


MY ordinary employment being of late for some time interrupted, and the usuall course of my studies, not so much diverted, as quite stopt by the late generall and miserable distractions of the Kingdome, and especially of the place I live in, I bethought my selfe of some meanes whereby I might mitigate my apprehension of the miseries issuing from these present distempers; When (I thinke God so directing it) this Treatise, with some others of the same nature, came to my hands. The Author is of as generall repute among us for learning, as any late Writer we have received from beyond the Seas these many yeares: and the Worke is an Explanation of the xx. Chapter of the Revelation. The Subject thereof is The assertion of the Glorious Kingdome of Christ here on earth; a matter no doubt of great comfort, and consolation to the Church of God. And as I am not ignorant that Apocalypticall Discourses in generall are liable to many censures, and that this Divine Prophecy it selfe is as yet a sealed book, in so much that the great Calvin was forced to acknowledge, (if the 
Io. Bodimus method Hist. cap. 7 reportes wrong him not) that

he knew not what so difficult and obscure a Writer, as the Author thereof, meant: so I am sure this part thereof hath beene subject to most divers and contrary interpretations; that what Epist. ad Paulinum Quot babet verb

My naturall propension to thankfulnesse makes me confesse I owe all that I am in good letters (I best know how little that is) to the foundation I laid thereof in Your excellent Seminary of learning, and to your extraordinary favour, and encouragement to good studies and endeavours. I pray God lead You alwaies along by the hand in all Your affaires and occasions.
