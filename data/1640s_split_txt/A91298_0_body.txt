Deſervedly Renowned Worthies,



YOUR Incomparable Valour, Zeale, Activity,
Induſtry for the preſervation of Your Deareſt
Country, Religion, Lawes, Liberties,
and the very being of Parliaments, all now
endangered by an unnaturall generation of
Popiſh and Malignant Vipers, lately riſen up
in Armes againſt them in diverſe parts of this
Realme; and thoſe many miraculous Victories
with which God hath beene lately pleaſed to Crowne your cordiall
endeavours, to promote his glory and the Publicke ſafety, as
they have justly demerited ſome gratefull generall Acknowledgements
from the whole Repreſentative Body of the State; ſo they
may in ſome ſort challenge a private gratulatory Retribution from
Me, who have formerly had the happineſſe to participate in your Chriſtian

Affections, and now reape much Conſolation by your Heroick
Actions.
Having therefore ſeaſonably finiſhed this Third part, Of the Soveraigne
Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms; copiouſly Vindicating,
the Lawfulneſſe, Iuſtneſſe of the Parliaments preſent
Neceſſary Defenſive Warre (in which you have had the Honour to
be imployed, not onely as Chiefe, but which is more, as moſt ſucceſſefull
Commanders, in your ſeverall Countries,) in point both of Law
and Conſcience; and fully wiping off thoſe blacke Aſperſions, of
TREASON and REBELLION, which the oppoſite party
(really guilty of theſe crimes againſt both King and Kingdome,
as I havePart 1. Edit. 2 p. 108, to 1. 12.
elſewhere manifeſted, and here lightly touched) have out
of Malice, Ignorance, or both conjoyned, moſt injuriouſly caſt upon your
Loyall, honourable proceedings, which rejoyce the ſoules of all true
Philopaters, who cordially affect their Country or Religion; I could
not, without much ingratitude, yea injuſtice, have publiſhed it to the
world, but under the Patronage of your ever-honored reſplendent names,
who have ſo valorouſly, ſo ſucceſſefully pleaded this Cauſe already in
the Field, that it needs the leſſe aſsiſtance from the Preſſe.

My many inevitable interruptions and ſtraites of time in its contexture,
which may happily detract ſomething from its perfection;
ſhall I hope, derogate nothing from your Honourable, Friendly acceptation;
whom I have thus conjoyned in the Dedication; becauſe the
Parliament hath united you in their preſent Warlike employments,
and God himſelfe joyntly honoured you with ſucceſſe, even to admiration
among the Good, indignation amidſt Malignants, envy with
the Malicious, and, I truſt, to an active ſedulous emulation in all your
Fellow Commanders, imployed in other Quarters in the ſelfeſame
Cauſe.
Your preſent buſie publike, and mine owne private Imployments,
prohibite me to expatiate; Wherefore earneſtly beſeeching the Glorious

Lord of Hoſts to be ever mightily preſent with your ſeverall Noble
Perſons, Forces, and to make you alwayes eminently, active, Valorous,
Victorious, as hitherto he hath done, till Peace and Truth,
Tranquillity and Piety, by your ſeverall triumphant Proceedings, ſhall
once more lovingly embrace and kiſſe each other in our divided
unreformed, ſinfull Kingdomes; And till the effect of theſe juſt warres
You manage, ſhall be quietneſſe and aſſurance to us and our Poſterities
after us for ever; I humbly recommend your Perſons, Proceedings
to his protection who can ſecure you in and from all dangers of
warre, and reſt,
