My Lord,


BE pleased to accept this grain of Incense, offered up to your name, on the Altar of a reall heart, and if I have erred in my devotion, stile it the sin of an hallowed ignorance, rather than the crime of any wilde presumption; daigne to confer upon me the Epithete of Superstitious rather than the attribute of prophane, since the latter issues from a defect of Worship, and the former results from an excesse of adoration. My Lord, your name is followed with such a train of acclamations, that I should have appeared dull even to stupidity, if I had not been wakened with their alarme, to the expression of my zeal, which I have endeavoured to improve by powring it forth into this Congratulation, and if it be too inconsiderable to intitle it selfe to so great a Patron, set upon it the noble character of your

mercy, and let it derive that from your charity, which it could not hope to finde from my selfe, the remission of many errours: The lowest hearts are the fittest sacrifice for the highest. Altars. Therefore, though this Poem cannot lay claim to your Lordships praise, suffer it to pretend to your Lordships pity: though I have no sublimity of Phansie to marshall me amongst the chiefest of Poets, yet I have humility, which shall ranke me amongst


The humblest of your Lordships adorers,

THOMAS PHILIPOT.
