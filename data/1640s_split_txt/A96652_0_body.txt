Rt. Wor.


HAd not the importunity
of friends prevailed with
me, I had never publiſhed
this Sermon preached
at the ſolemnization
of the funerall obſequies,
of your Noble brother, Sir
Charles) for I was never ſo well conceited
of the product of my weak brain,
as to deem it worthy publique view.
If Moſes the authour of my Text,Exod. 4. 10.

profeſſed that he was not eloquent,
that he was ſlow of ſpeech, and unapt
for ſo great employment as he was called
to: I am ſure I have ten thouſand
thouſand times more cauſe to diſclaime
eloquence and to acknowledge my
owne weakeneſſe, and unworthineſſe;
yet this is my comfort Innocentia melior
eloquentiâ
Quintilian. innocence is better then
eloquence; a good cauſe better then a
good oratour.
This little Manuall or Enchiridion I
am ſure will be cenſured, and I feare
more then practiced:Scrinia damagnis, me manus una capit. Mar. lib. 1. epig. 2. one perhaps
will quarrell with the ſtile, another with
the method, and others with the matter,
but let ſuch know that I ſeeke not the
ſuffrages of their praiſe or approbation,

lyes breath corruption
on the beſt proviſion: the malignity
of whoſe wit, can find fault with
the beſt actions, not onely of men, but
of God alſo, as Lucians Momus, who

being called to judge of the excellency
of thoſe maſter peeces the gods had
made, (ſcil.) a man, a houſe and a horſe,
found fault withal three, with the horſe,
that it had not hornes for defence, with
the houſe, that it had not motion, and
with the man, that he had not a window
to look into his breaſt: even ſo theſe
malevolent cenſurers criticiſe with a
froward curioſity upon the beſt and pureſt
volumnes, and often times fill and
blot them with their own Aſtericks and
errata's. And where a candid cenſure
might of every thing make a good conſtruction,
and take all in a faire ſenſe,
there will they through miſconſtruction
or ſome idle conjecture, though to
the fulleſt period, adde, a nonnulla
deſiderantur, that ſomething is wanting,
or that it might have beene better
done otherwiſe. Inſomuch that it is even
a taske for divinity to pleaſe man,
