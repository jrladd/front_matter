MY LORD,


IT may ſeem a daring and ſuperfluous act to preſent any draughts of Policy to ſo great a Stateſman as your ſelfe, eſpecially for me, ſo out of diſtance to yeares, experience, practice, employment, profeſſion, but my privilege is the ſubject I make choice on, a ſubject enriched with all

theſe, I know, as the Samaritane ſaid, The Well is deepe, and I have nothing to draw with, nothing if compared with the talents of deeper judgements, but my engagement to your Lordſhip is the Univerſiy, our Studies wearing your Honours title and ſuperſcription, and our Savoiur hath there entitled a Tribute, where there is Image and Superſcription, what I doe heere is but in the right recognition, what I doe in the next leafe is in right of Dedication and patronage, God make your Grace a Jewell to the Crowne below, and prepare you a Crowne above, My Lord,
