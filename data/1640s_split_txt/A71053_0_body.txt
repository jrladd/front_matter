I Have but the thoughts of an afternoon to ſpread before you, for I examined the ſame pace that I read; that if it were poſſible, a truth might overtake an errour ere it got too farre. It is not a little encouragement that I may ſit like the Propheteſſe under the Palmetree, under ſuch a ſhade as your ſelves; and what weakneſſe ſoever may appeare in theſe my aſſertions, This ayring them under your Patronage will heale them, for ſo they brought forth the ſick into the ſtreets, that at leaſt the ſhadow of Peter might touch ſome of them. Thus

have I ſuddenly ſet up my Candle for others to light their Torch at; and I hope you will pardon me, if my zeale to the truth, made mee ſee anothers faults ſooner than my own.
