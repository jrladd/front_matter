that there are no Accessories in Treason; whence to conceale a Notorious Traytor, is really to be one. The consideration of the Capitalnesse of such a Concealement in these proditorious times, and the discharge of my bounden Duty to my Soveraigne Lord the King, this Church and Kingdome, (of which I am a true, though unworthy member;) and to this Honourable Court (to whose impartiall Iustice, next under God I owe the fruition of my present Liberty, my Native Soyle, and Quondam Profession of the Law) hath induced me by way of Gratitude, to present your

I could not but conjecture, that this Antipathy, would be very distastfull to our Lordly Prelates; (the Malefactors) whose long-concealed Treasons, Conspiracies & seditious practises it lays open to your publick view and justice; so that I can expect nothing but such extreame Malignity, opposition and Calumnies from them and their confederates, as might in some sort have deterred me from divulging it. Yet, whē I considered that the detectiō of grosse Traytors & Conspirators, hath bin ever reputed, not only an inoffensive, but acceptable and meritorious service both to Kings and States in al other persons, and that I have no cause to doubt, but that it will receive the selfesame benigne interpretation in me, especially from your Honours, (by some of whose earn

For being a Prisoner in the Tower of London, stript of my Profession and all other imployments by some Prelates undemerited malice, considering with my selfe, how I might there passe my solitary houres in the usefullest manner, for the publicke benefit of this Church and Kingdome; it pleased God among other subjects, to pitch my thoughts upon a Collection of the severall Treasons, Rebellions, Warres, Seditions, and Anti-monarchicall Practises of Lordly Prelats of all Countries and ages (especially of our owne English Bishops) which I found scattered in Histories: wherupon (taking my hint from the Title of a now-non-extant Booke, written by one Thomas Gybson a Physitian in King Edward the 6. his dayes, stiled Proditiones Praelatorum a Conquestu, seene by our laborious Iohn Bale and mentioned in his

Arch Prelate of Canterbury not long after, persecuting me afresh in the Starcham

er without any just occasion, procured me there, not onely to bee most inhumanely censured, but likewise to be sent thence close prisoner, first to Carnarvan, then to

Mount-Orguile Castle in the Isle of Iersie, and there cloystred up so narrowly that I could neither have the use of pen, inke, paper, writings nor Bookes to benefit my selfe or others; and withall searching both my Chamber and friends houses sundry times by his Pursevants, seized on all my bookes and Papers he could meete with. But these Collections escaping his clutches, fell into the hands of another persecuted Gentleman, who without my privity carried them beyond the Seas, where they were preserved till after my late returne from Exile (by the justice of this Honourable House,) and not many moneths since, (when I gave them over as lost) were unexpectedly returned to my hands in safety, whiles the businesse of Episcopacy was in agitation before your Eminencies; which speciall Providence, put me in minde of that speech of Morde

Who knoweth whether thou art come to the Kingdome for such a time as this? and made me strongly apprehend, that God had restored me to Liberty, and these Collections to my hands, for such a time as this, (which blessed be our good God we now live to see,) wherein our domineering Prelates lewde practises and Conspiracies against our Religion, Lawes, Liberties, Lives, Soules, and Estates, are not onely detected, but questioned; and some of the Potentest and pestilentest of them, charged with no lesse than High Treason, and other most grosse Misdemeanors, in, and by your Honorable Assembly; which have rendred them so generally detestable to the whole Kingdome, that divers Petitions have beene presented to your Honours, both by Ministers and

People out of many entire Countries, for their utter extirpation; which long efflagitated difficult worke, (which your Honours have now set upon) I conceive the publishing of this Antipathy, will much facilitate and advance, being thus specially preserved, and reserved by Gods Providence, for such a time as this.
The principall motives which originally induced me to undertake this worke, were the very same which have now perswaded me to publish it.
First, an unfeined desire to dispossesse the seduced  and mis-informed judgements of Princes, Nobles, and others, of that over-weaning opinion they have hitherto generally embraced of Lordly Prelats extraordinary fidelity, sincerity, Piety to Kings & Kingdomes in Chur

h and State affaires; and of the necessity of their Supportation & continuan
•
e, both for the Security, Tranquillity and felicity of all Christian Kings States, Churches; to all which, in verity, they have beene the greatest Plagues and Opposites. This notable mistake, proceeding, either out of a meere nescience or inadvertency of the Prelates trecherous plots and turbulent Actions in all Climes and times; or, from the deception of this false Paradox, No Bishop, no King; or, from the immoderate panegyricall applauses of their Parasites, (who almost deifie them in Presse, in Pulpit, especially in Court Sermons) and their owne selfe-commendations, which are now most frequent in their writings and discourses; or, from their owne outward Pompe, Splendor, and Superficiall shewes of Sanctity and Piety; backed with their sordid flattery of, and temporizing with the greatest men, the better to effect

their owne designes; will soonest and best bee rectified by this bare Historicall discovery of their Trecheries and villanies in all ages; the very knowledge whereof (as the Prophet Malachy and Christ informe us) Mal

To anticipate and redresse which sad events then, and secure us against the like effects of Prelacie both now and hereafter, I could not (in my poore Judgement) finde out any readier course within the narrow spheare of my Activity, than the publication of this History, of our Prelates practises and disloyal

Fourthly, to further the propagation of religion, the frequent and sincere preaching of the Gospell, the powerfull practise of true piety, the salvation of mens soules, and tranquillity of our Church and State: to all which, I dare confidently averre, our Lordly Bishops have beene greater enemies and obstacles in all ages,

These were the speciall reasons both of my compiling and publishing this Antipathy; wherin your Excellencies may clearely discerne; that these Exorbitances of our Prelates, are not so much the vices of their Persons, as of their Function; which though their many late published Pamphlets, would prove to be of Divine Right, yet the pernicious evill fruits thereof infallibly proclaime, to be of meere humane wrong. And in my weake judgement, there can be no such safe, short, and infallible way to

decide this controversie, Whether Episcopacy be of Divine institution or not? then to consider the fruits thereof in all ages: that of our Saviour being of eternall verity, Mat. 7.16.20.
Ye shall know them by their fruites. Since then the fruites of our Lordly Prelates, in this (and in other kindes too as I could abundantly manifest) have beene so desperately evill, and they generally the greatest

two chiefe arguments of moment, for the continuance of Episcopacy, which sticke with any judicious men. The first in point of State Polity; No Lord Bishop, no King. The second in point of Church Polity; No Bishops, no peace, no government, and nothing but Schismes in the Church: The first, I trust, I have abundantly cleared by this Antipathy; The second (God willing) I intend to dissipate in an Historicall Treatise of the Schismes of our English Lordly Prelates among themselves, enough to make a volume; and then by a larger Remonstrance, experimentally evidencing out of Ecclesiasticall Histories That Bishops have beene, if not the sole, yet at least the chiefe Authors of all the Schismes that ever infested and rent the Church of God. And if this be made good (as

it easily may be against all the world) the proud Hierarchy of our Lordly Prelates will fall to ground of it self without helpe of hands to pull it downe.

First, we shall still bee under the government of  our Christian Kings, 1 Eliz. c. 1.

Secondly, under the Government of our Parliaments, Lawes, and inferiour Magistrates; who doe, and will take speciall care for our Churches good reglement.

Fourthly, under the government of an Ordinary  or Extraordinarie Provinciall or Nationall Synode, as there is occasion.
Fifthly, under such a religious orderly Government, as your Wisedomes, upon the abolishing of Episcopacy, shall please to erect among us, as most consonant to the Law of God, and Civill Government of our State. And can any then justly complaine of a want of Government in the Church, when it is but altered for the better?

Trent it selfe: that the first and principle part of a Bishops office, is diligently to preach Gods Word to the people: and therefore this very Councell enjoynes all Bishops to preach the Scripture and Gods Law every Lordsday, and Holiday, and moreover in the Lent,

Advent, and other Fasts; quotidie, vel saltem tribus in hebdomade diebus Sacras Scripturas Divinamque legem annuncient, to preach every day, or at least three times a weeke. Now our Lordly Prelates have beene so farre from executing this principle part of their office and worke, that some of them (as Canterbury, York
•
, London, and Oxford) did not so much as preach one Sermon in sundry yeares: others of them have preached very rarely; yea, most of them have by themselves and their instruments See Sh

written and preached against frequent preaching; suppressed all week-day Lectures, and Sermons, on Lordsday afternoones throughout their Diocesses; and Dr
Pierce Bishop of Bath and Wells, by name, in a Letter to Canterbury, thanked God that he had not left one Lecture, nor afternoone Sermon in his Diocesse: and suspended the Minister of Bridgwater onely for preaching a Lecture in his owne parish Church, which had continued 50. years; & when this Bishop, after much solicitation upon this Ministers promise, never to preach
•
 the Lecture more, absolved him from his suspension, hee then most blasphemously applyed 
Iob. 5.14.
Christs words used to the sicke man, to this good Minister. Behold thou art made whole: Goe away, sinne no more: (that is, preach no more) lest a worse thing come unto thee: hee convented another Minister, only for expounding the Catechisme on the Lordsday afternoone, saying, it was AS BAD as Preaching. So that preaching now in this and other our Prelates judgement, is both a Sinne, and a bad thing, carefully to be suppressed. And this wee may generally observe, that those who were diligent Preachers before

they became Bishops, being once made such, became usually either See M. Latim

I tell thee wee Bishops were not ordained to preach: it being too meane an office for them, unlesse it be sometimes at the Court, or at some such solemne meeting, to gaine either more honour or preferment thereby, or for some such private ends; not out of any great zeale of converting soules to God: Since then our Bishops thus neglect, nay hate, condemne, suppresse and persecute, the good worke of Preaching, wherein their

office principally consists; it is most apparent, that the onely thing they now so zealously write & stickle for, is, only the temporall meanes, & honour, not the Divine spiritual worke, or office of Episcopacie; & since these thus avocate and hinder them from preaching, I presume your excellent wisedomes will deem it necessary, to strip them naked of these two obstacles, which cause them thus to neglect their proper worke and duty.
Neither would I have your Honours, or any else here misconceive mee: as if I advised you, to deprive Ministers of all Honour and Maintenance: God forbid. No, my hearts desire and prayer to God and your Honours shall be, that every painfull preaching Minister may have all due Honourable respect,

and such a competent allowance, as the greatnesse of his paines and charge demerit. But that Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes, and others who have no particular flocks to feed: & either preach not at all, or very seldome, should have such temporall dignities, offices, and See Prov. 30.8, 9.

African Bishops more in the great schisme of the Donatists, were content to lay downe all their Bishoprickes for the peace and unity of the Church: thinking thereby not to lose them, but to commit them more safely to Gods custody: and used this most golden speech, An vero Redemptor, &c. What verily did our Redeemer descend from Heaven into humane members, that wee should be his members, and shall we, lest his very members should be rent in pieces with a cruell division, feare to descend out of our chairs? We are ordained Bishops for Christian people: What therefore may profit Christian people for Christian peace, that let us doe with our Bishoprickes. What I am, I am for thee, if it profit thee; I am not so, if it hurt thee. If wee be profitable servants, why do wee envie the eternall gaines of our Lord for our temporall sublimities? Our Episcopall dignity will be more fruitfull to us; if being laid downe, it shall more unite the flocke of Christ, then disperse it if retained. My brethren; if wee mind the Lord, thi

Simundum praedicas contemnendum, contemne tu prius, & ad ipsum efficacius alios invitabis: If thou preachest the World is to be contemned, do thou contemne it first, and then thou shalt more effectually invite others thereto. I cannot but presume our Lordly Prelates, if they have any sparkes of piety, or humility in them, will now at last for our Churches our Kingdomes future peace, security and felicity, lay downe their Bishoprickes at your Honours feete; or else that your Eminences will enforce them thereunto, it being more equall and expedient, that a few Lord Bishops should meritoriously lose their pernitious honours, than our King, Church, State, Religion, Lawes, Liberties, Peace, be perpetually indangered, and imbroyled by their continuance.
