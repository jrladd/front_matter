And Reſt (ſaith hee) ſhall be the naturall daughter of the woman, clothed with the Sun, (meaning a ſpirituall reſt) which are the moſt entire and chaſte Congregation of all the reſt, (yet no Sect) which above others ſhine with this glorious aray; And it ſeemeth, (ſaith he) that all the chief ſtreſſe and violence of the laſt battell in the Weſt, ſhall be turned againſt that holy Congregation, which we ſaid right now, to ſtand glittering in the Sun, which are the hill of precious fruits, and the mountain full of holy pleaſures, of which God maketh more account thenSee 2 Eſdr. 7. 26. 34, 35. See 2 Eſdr. 6. 28. of all delight ſome things in the world. Now you white rayment Chriſtians, are this woman, clothed with the Sun; for you all believe that you are clothed with the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, and ſtand in him before God: Here is an Ax for you; for the bleſſing of Joſhua belongs to you, which he ſpake to the children of Joſeph. Thou art a great people, and haſt great power, therefore the mountain ſtall be thine, for it is a wood, and thou ſhalt cut it down, and the ends of it ſhall be thine, and thou ſhalt caſt out the Canaanites, though they have iron Chariots, and though they be ſtrong, J

So here are mountains of ſins, errors and falſe religions, in England and Ireland, it is a wood of Sects, Schiſmes and Hereſies, but thou haſt cut them down, for thou art a great people, and haſt great power (with the Lord in prayer) and England ſhall be thine, and thou ſhalt caſt out the Canaanites of ſin, Idolatry, and falſe Religions, though they have Ordnance of iron, and though they be ſtrong, lay this Ax of the Law to the root of them; and ſhew them, that now alſo every tree, i. Religion, Church, Sect, or man, that bringeth forth ſin before God, (Iſai. 1. 16.) is hewn down and caſt into the fire of God wrath, for the wrath of God is now revealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe of men, which withhold truth in unrighteouſneſſe (Rom. 1. 18) for the hour of temptation is come, to try them that are upon the face of the earth, Rev. 2. 10. in which friends ſhall fight with friends, as with enemies, and the earth ſhalll fear with
