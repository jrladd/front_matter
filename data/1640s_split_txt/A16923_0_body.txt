THe long experience, I have had of your Honours favourable intentions towards me, hath compell'd me to this Presumption. But I hope your Goodnesse will be pleased to pardon what your Benignity was the cause of, viz. the errour of my Dedication. Had your Candor not encourag'd me, in this I had beene innocent: Yet (I beseech you) thinke not, I intend it any other, then your Recreation at your retirement from your

weighty Employments; and to be the Declaration of your gracious encouragements towards me, and the testimony of my Gratitude. If the publicke view of the world entertayn it with no lesse welcome, then that private one of the Stage already has given it, I shall be glad the World owes you the Thankes: If it meet with too severe Construction, I hope your Protection. What hazards soever it shall justle with, my desires are it may pleasure your Lordship in the perusall, which is the only ambition he is conscious of, who is

My  Lord,
