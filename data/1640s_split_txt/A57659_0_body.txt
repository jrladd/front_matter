Sir,


FOr two reasons this Book addr
•
sseth it self to you for patronage; The one is, because you are aff
•
cted with this kind of learning, which hath the priviledge above other Studies, that it is delightfull and usefull too: neither is there any Studie that sutes better with the disposition of a Gentleman, then ancient Poetry; which, though it be accounted but an aiery kinde of learning by such as speak against it, either out of prejudice or ignorance; yet in the balance of wise mens esteem these ancient Poets are not too light: But if these Censurers please to cast an impartiall eye upon this Book, they will finde, that there are no Books wherein so much learning is couched up in so little bounds, as in these old Poets, who were indeed the onely

learned men of their times: I could instance one, in whose rich cabinet are treasured up the jewels of all Learning fit for a Gentleman to know; and that is Virgil by name, the king of Poets. The other reason of this Dedication to you is, to expresse my gratitude to your worth and goodnesse, and for your particular affection to use: I know the native beauty of your vertues needs not the adulterating art of rhetoricall painting, therefore I will not use it, as being inconsistent with your modestie and my ingenuitie: Onely I desire that you will accept of this small present as a token of his love, who will alwayes be found

Sir,
