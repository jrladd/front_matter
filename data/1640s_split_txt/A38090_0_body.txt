DEare and beloved Christians, for your sal
•…
es in speciall who are apt to be troubled with many doubts and feares about the Constitution and Government of the visible Church, and the way of Worship and Communion in it, have I drawn up this present Answer, as to undeceive you in the Apologists, the Apologie, and their Church-way, so to satisfie you in your scruples and doubts about Presbyterie. It was my love, care and respect to tender consciences, that more especially moved me at first (now some seven yeares agoe) to fall upon the more thorough studying and searching into the controversies of the Church, &c. And the grounds which now of late have afresh revived my thoughts and studies that way, are, 1. The recovering and reducing conscientious Christians who are not too far engaged. 2. The setling some who are wavering and doubtfull. 3. The keeping of others from falling▪ Now the first borne of my latter thoughts and studies in this kind, is this Antapologi
•…
, which I here recommend to you for a true glasse to behold the faces of Presbyterie and Independencie in, with the beauty, order, strength of the one, and the deformity, disorder and weaknesse of the other: And good Reader, I have some reason to beleeve and hope, that if you will indeed reade and consider, looke impartially and throughly into this glasse, you may be either changed into the image of it, or at least so stumbled at Independencie, as to be kept from falling into it, and willing in the meane time to waite upon God in that way of his, an Assembly of so many learned and godly Divines, to see what he will be pleased to speake by them: I at first intended, and accordingly provided materials for a large Epistle to this Book, the more to make way for it in the hearts and consciences of the people, as well knowing there are laid in before hand by many of the Independent party, many prejudices both against my person and the Book, to hinder if possible the fruit and benefit of it, yea to keep people from so much as reading any part of it, that so receiving and beleeving the Independent Grounds without hearing or examining the other side, they may be still kept in ignorance and error: I had many thoughts and purposes in my Epistle, to have given the Reader an accompt of my especiall call to the making this Answer, as also to have laid downe the Principles and Rules I more especially went by in the studying of these controversies, and then to have Apologized for my selfe and Book, by answering some objections and clearing aspersions cast abroad in this mistaking age, and by representing to the Reader my many sufferings, constant labours, &c. and so to have compared my grounds moving me to make this Antapologia, with the Apologists grounds occasioning their Apologeticall Narration, and my Principles with their three Principles expressed in their Apologie, and my sufferings, troubles, patience and labours, with their exile and patience, &c. and then left them to the Reader to judge in those matters between us; but conceiving the danger of this way in comparing with the Apologists, least I might become a foole in glorying, and runne into the same fault I charge upon the Apologists, and least it might be thought I sought to commend my Answer by such wayes rather then by the strength of the discourse it selfe, I resolved to forbeare all those comparisons and vindications of my selfe, and to refer all to God; and that I may not hold the Reader too long in the portch, I will only insist somewhat upon justifying and clearing the lawfulnesse of the way and manner of this Answer, and the grounds I goe upon for matters of fact reported in it, and this I must doe of necessitie, for besides other grounds calling for it, within these few dayes, just before the Antapologie was comming forth, a Pamphlet, entituled The Anatomist Anatomized was printed, rather to

prepossesse the Reader against the Antapologie, then to answer the Anatomie of Independencie (as all may see) and to be a shelter rather against this shower (as the Anatomizer calls it) ready to fall, then to dry up the drops already fallen: But 
〈◊〉
 shall by the helpe of God, not only satisfie the Reader, that this covering is too narrow, and the stuffe too slight to keep out the shower from wetting, but make an advantage of it, even to gaine the greater credit and beliefe to the things asserted in my Booke, and to remove this opinion from lurking in many other bosomes, and in particular to make the charge sit heavier upon the Anatomizer, by speaking particularly to the matters of fact concerning him, in accepting of his motion and request, of proving the reports concerning him by witnesses, and before a judicatorie, I must therefore answer to the three Propositions of the Anatomizer as they have reference to the Antapologie. 1. That many things reported in this Antapologie are misreported. 1. Let the Reader observe, that the Anatomizer though he play the fore-game, and will be before hand in speaking to a Book before it come forth (and because truth will hardly overtake a
•…
ye that is set out foure or five dayes before it (as himselfe speakes) therefore he will be sure to send forth in time even some dayes before reports come out) yet the Anatomizer doth not say all things reported are misreported, so that though many things may be misreported, many things also may be truly reported; and in page 4. in the definition he is pleased to give of the Antapologie, 'tis a Collection of such faults, as either ment mistakes and malice, or perhaps mens own infirmities have made, either beyond the seas or here, he denies not the truth of all the reports and fa
•…
les, but grants them with a perhaps. 2. I desire the Reader to consider, that for the matters of fact related in the Apologie, which in this Answer I speake unto, asserting the contrary upon Reasons and grounds laid downe by me, I never intended by such an Answer, to make a Judiciarie infallible proofe (which as 'tis not necessary in the way of answering matter of fact, so neither can it be by rationall men expected, as if without that no sufficient Answer were given to disprove facts) but only a rationall probable proofe from Letters and other Manuscripts going under the names of the Apologists, and superscribed to their known friends, from reports of men of credit, and such who have lived amongst them, hearing and seeing things, and from many circumstances of place, time, &c. by which in reason men may well judge accordingly, and for this kind of proofe I beleeve I can make as rationall and conscientious a one to satisfie my selfe and all indifferent persons, to judge according to what I write, as hath been made these many yeares (for since the Apologie came forth, I have used a great deale of care, diligence and circumspection, both by 
〈◊〉
 to know the truth of things I formerly had been informed of, and by inquiting particularly of many persons concerning circumstances and their proofes, and questioning with them how they knew such a thing, &c. as also by forbearing to insert matters related to me upon a single tes
•…

monie and witnesse, where there were not other strong circumstances con
•…
ing to make them out;) And yet for all the care I have used, 'tis possible that among so many things related by 
〈◊〉
, there may be some mistakes in the reports of some circumstances in matter of order and time, place or number (though I know none such) and yet the report and fact true, (A report may be true and yet mistaken in one circumstance, which when it comes to scanning may prove more foule in another▪) so that the 
•…
se stands thus, whether the Apologists relating such and such matters o
•…
 fact, an Answe
•…
er having evidences and testimonies by him of Letters written in their names, reports from credible men, as godly Ministers and Christians their own friends, with other circumstances concurring, hath not reason to question the truth of such facts, and to answer to them, by laying downe his grounds why he judges otherwise; and for my Answer

to the Apologists, if in their Reply they deny any of the matters of fact I speake unto, I will in my Rejoynder at the end of it, print all their Letters, with other Letters of their friends that I have by me, and name the parties from whose hands I had them, and how I came by them, and relate other circumstances which for present I have concealed, and then let the Reader judge whether I had not reason to beleeve, and Answer as I doe. But as for a Judiciarie proofe of all matters of fact in my Antapologie, I not seeing those Letters writ, and most of my Letters being but copies, and many of the facts being done beyond the seas, considering also 'tis possible the relators may mistake in some things, I cannot positively and judicially sware, and make out such a kind of proofe, 3. For some matters of fact spoken to in this Antapologia▪
 I know and am certaine of in my own knowledge, and had them from some of the Apologists own mouthes, and though they 
〈◊〉
 have forgotten them, I can for a need rubbe up their memories, by minding them 
〈◊〉
 the places, times and occasions which they cannot deny; I have also some originall Letters by me to prove some things asserted by me in this Answer, and for the most materiall things of their preaching and acting for their way, besides that the things themselves speake and are notorious, I have many eare and eye witnesses both of Ministers and people which I can produce, so that if I have reason to beeleeve a report of any thing I see no

 Now finding severall passages in the Apologie in point of fact, related with height of considence, contrary to my knowledge and to the testimonie of many, with a cōcurrence of other circumstances which I could not doubt of, & observing other matters of fact brought by the Apologists to take the people with, against which though there were not such strong proofs, yet in the drawing up my Answer to such p

ticulars, whether might not I now upon probable grounds as one sufficient witnesse with the circumstance of place and time, &c. question these, and judge them to be much like the others. 4. Particularly for M. Simpson, because he hath publikely printed that the Antapologie is a

es all that's brought by himselfe against the Anatomie or the Antapologie, himselfe taking up reports suddenly, and beleeving here sayes, before he ever saw any one sheete yea or one page of the Antapologie, branding a Minister and his, Booke for a collection of such faults as either mens mistakes and malice have made, by tellin

•…
uded to beleeve what's said by him there, and by that be prepossest against the truth of the Antapologie, I accept of his motion and request, and if he will be pleased to procure any lawfull though the strictest Judicatorie, yea the highest, I am ready for so much as concerns him, to appeare and bring my witnesses to a faire hearing, and if the Judicature will give time, and grant Warrants to bring in the witnesses that they may be deposed, I doubt not but besides a rationall Answer by way of writing (which I intended) to make also a full Judiciar
•…
 proofe, yea to prove more then yet I have charged Mr Simpson with, only I desire if I must be put to this trouble, that Mr. Simpsons small and just request may be granted by

the Judicature, that he may suffer if he have done what in the Antapologie is reported of him, and if I cannot make it good, then I am contented to suffer, and I am willing also to be judged by his own Law, Pag. 7. Lege Remmia, to be branded with a K in the forehead, if I doe not by witnesses prove his preaching and acting for his way, upon condition he may be served so if I doe, and to the letter K to have the addition of L and P. But it may be objected, Why doth Mr. Simpson of all the Apologists put forth such a Book before hand, and dare it thus? I answer in his own words, some may perhaps conceive 'tis a signe of guilt to speake so much, and I conceive Mr Simpsons guilt and consciousnesse caused feare, and feare that hastned him to thrust forth something in the way of the Antapologie, to blast the credit of it before it was come forth, and the truth of it is, he of all the Apologists hath been most faulty both in Holland and in England, and for the close of this concerning whats reported in the Antapologie of M. Sympson, I shall speake in the words made use of by himselfe, God taketh the wise in their owne crastinesse, and will destroy such wisdome, and so I beleeve he hath done this of M Sympsons forestalling the Antapologie,

iall, or had he staid till the Antapologie had come forth to have read what I charge him with, he would never have written thus.
2. Propos. That tis no way of God to divulge mens personall faults, supposing the matter of facts to be true yet the divulging of them in this manner is not according to the Word of God.

I answer, all that is brought by the Anatomizer for proofe page 5. out of Matt. 18. and his other grounds are nothing to the case and point in hand, namely of making this Answer, and I would aske Mr Sympson, whether it be lawfull to make any Answer at all to the Apologie, if it be, then certainly if the Apologists have personall things and matters of fact, no man can answer them fully, and as they ought to be answered, but he must speake to personall things and matters of fact, and the fault of divulging personall things is not in the Antapologist but in the Apologists: As for the 18. of Matth. that speakes of private offences, and of offences that may be in that way healed, and the other grounds brought by M. Sympson speaks to offences already repented of, and not of such which in stead of being judged faults are made use of publikely to draw men into a way of errour by, I give therefore these two distinct Answers: 1. The Apologists have publiquely and openly sinned in avowing some things in the Apologie, and they never yet repented of them, (as I heard) but M. Sympson justifies himselfe, and them in his Anatomist anatomized, pag. 4. Now the Apostles rule is 1 Tim. 5. 19, 20. though Timothy may not receive an accusation against an Elder under two or three witnesses, yet them that sinne openly may be rebuked before all, that others may feare, now as the▪
Apologists by Printing told all the Churches, so by Printing it may be told to all the Churches, the remedie ought to be proportioned according to the disease, the plaister to be as large as the sore, the Apologie hath spread it selfe to the Parliament, Citie, Kingdome, and so ought the Remedie; may Independents publiquely & confidently write untruths, and may not others in way of answering plainly point at them, but tis against the way of God, and not according to the Word, 2. This may not only lawfully be done, but this ought to be done, when men shall tell sine stories, and bring matters of fact, interweave them all along to prove such a way by, and to gaine people to errours by such Rhetoricall arguments, he who answers such a booke, and would preserve people from errours is bound to disprove all he can those matters of fact, and to speake to those popular arguments, by weakning the truth of those Relations all he knowes, and secondly by showing how they are not

argumentative nor evincing, supposing they were true: Tis well knowne by them who are verst in the writings of the Protestants against the Papists, how in many of the Controversies, especially upon the notes of the Church, the Protestant writers doe, wherein they stand on matters of fact, disprove them by matters of fact and personall things, as upon Unitie, Holinesse of life, &c. and I conceive in giving an Answer to the Apologie, I could not have declined matters of fact without gratifying the cause of Independencie, and wronging the truth; I suppose the excellencie of an Answer, as distinct from writing Tractates upon such a subject, or such a point consists in three things: 1. In not speaking whatever a man pleases, or bringing in whatever he hath a mind to, but in following the text before him, and in keeping his discourse close to that. 2. In not omitting any materiall passages, skipping over the knots, passing by the hard arguments and falling on the weake, snatching here and there, but going thorough all. 3. In labouring to take the Authours mind laid down in the words and scope, and in not wresting and fastning another sense upon the Authour: All which I propounded to my selfe in falling upon this Answer, and have aimed at in it, and therefore could not omit matters of fact nor personall things brought by the Apologists, especially when all along they are with much art framed and set to gaine credit to the Church way, to prove some maine principles of their way, and to effect their desires; For instance, how is a story with the Apologists practise upon it, pag. 16, 17, 20, 21. brought to prove the effectuall successe of submission and Non-communion, how is their good carriage since their returne into England, and their exile made use of to move for a Toleration, how is all that Narration of 3, 4, 
〈◊〉

▪ pages, of their enquirie into the Word of Christ, &c. laid downe as so many grounds to possesse the Reader of the truth of the Church way, let the Apologeticall Narration be analiz'd, and it will be found there is no point of fact, or personall thing in it, but is brought in some way or other as a motive or argument for their way, so that of necessitie I could not avoid matter of fact, unlesse I would betray the truth. Paul in the second of the Galathians 11, 12, 13. openly rebukes Peter, because he was to be blamed for his with-drawing and separating himself, and because others thereupon were carried away with it, and so because the Apologists doe not only withdraw and separate themselv
•…
, but by their Apologeticall Narration doe even compell others also, I cannot but speak.
3. Propos. That 'tis not argumentative against the cause that, falsly called Independencie, nor rationall or conducing to decide any, or this controversie.

1. That the Apologists and the Anatomizers way is not falsly but truly cald Independencie, I referre the Reader to these pages in this present answer, 201, 202, 203. Secondly, were all the matters of fact, and the Narration of them argumentative for the Apologists cause to move the Parliament, and to draw the Reader to their way, and is not the disproving of them argumentative against it, if this be not argumentative against Independencie, then I am sure the greatest part of the Apologet. Narration is nothing materiall for it, and wher
•…
fore then was that storie of a Minister deposed, and matter of fact upon it inserted in the Narration with many other, and supposing that to be true, that ther's no reasoning from the qualitie of the person to his cause, why then doe you so much doe it in your Apologie, taking all occasions to magnifie your partie, and reasoning from your persons to your cause, from your sufferings,

patience, &c. but whether there be any strength or no in that, it matters not, tis strongly argumentative in any point to overthrow mens own mediums, and that the Antapologie doth; in a word, there's more consequence then the Anato
•…
zer is willing to see in that maine Assertion of the Apologie, That one Church may non-Communion, but not excommunicate another (as he termes it,) to the miscarriages of M. Sympson and his Church, for might Presbyteriall Government take place, we should not have men so easily principled into Anabaptisme, nor make a covenant with separation, &c. as in this answer in many places is proved. And so much for answer to Mr. Sympsons Book as far as it concernes the Antapologie, and may be a block in the way of it, Now besides this, there is one objection more that hath been in the mouths of some Independents, and may be instilled into many more to hinder the fruit 
〈◊〉
 benefit of this Answer, namely (against the maner of the Answer) that tis 
〈◊〉
 Answer full of bitternesse, malice, reproaches, railings, and that tis a booke written against Gods people and good men. For consutation of this objection, I present to the Readers apprehension these following particulars. 1. I have endeavoured for the manner of doing it, that it might be without all just exceptions in regard of hard words and better speeches, and I can truly say I have declined many words and phrases more proper, and taken other words which in some places have readred the stile more rugged to avoide offensive phrases, and all along though I often disprove matters of fact, yet I never use so harsh a word (to my remembrance) as false, much lesse a lye, but untrue, and this is not so, whereas M. Sympson in his Pamphlet useth falsly and hath the word lye. 2. I desire the conscientious indisterent Reader to consider my book is not a Treatise or Tractate upon what subject I please to speak of, but an Answer, and so must follow where that leads me, & speak to that. 2. Tis an Answer to a book full of matter of fact, and stories of the Authours themselves, so that I cannot answer without particularising, the truth cannot be evidenced to the Reader without cōming somewhat to particulars. 
〈◊〉
. The Book contains matter of high praise of themselves and their partie (a few inconsiderable persons comparatively) with many close, indirect, and dangerous insinuations against all the Reformed Churches, which cannot be answered particularly without some recrimination and charge. 4. There are many particulars in matters of fact, I prove and charge the Apologists with, and some too bad for untruth. 5. I forbeare men
•…
oning the names of many particular persons which this Apologie leads me unto, some wholly, others I speak of only under the 
〈◊〉
 letter of their names, and for the Apologists though I often particularly name them, yet in some places of my Book, and in some grosser things, I forbeare particularizing them too. 6. I medle not with personall things and matters of fact that are heterogeneall, to relate other kind of facts and practises which I have heard on knowne of any the Apologists; but speake only of such as are proper to the matter occasioned from their Apologie, or the effects and fruits of their Church way, the Apologists themselves giue the occasion to the laying open so many particulars, which no other occasion but such an one as this could have drawn forth from me to have made their names and practices thus publike. 7. In many passages of this Answer I doe upon severall occasions give the Apologists a just testimonie of that worth for parts and piety which is in them, and speak to them, and of them as Brethren, so that let but all these things be laid:

together, considering also the Rules of Scripture in such Cases, and that I intended a plaine particular down-right Answer, and this Answer will then be accounted candid, moderate, my pe
•…
dipped in oile, and not in vinegar.
3. I can truly speak it that this present Antapologia is so farre from being written out of any malice or ill will to the Apologists, that I love their persons, and value them as brethren, yea some of them above brethren, and besides that love I beare to them as Saints, I have a personall love, and a particular love of friendship to some of them, and I can truly speake it, that I writ not this book nor any part of it out of any personall quarrell, old grudge, or former difference (for to this day there never was any such difference or unkindnesse passed between us) but I have writ it with much sorrow, unwillingnesse and some kind of conflict, in respect of that old personall love and friendship still strong in me, and had not the truth constrained me, my call to this worke beene strong, and the cause of God and Reformation much in my eye, I had out of my personall love and respect to some of the Apologists given over the worke: I can, and am ready to doe them any service of love, even the meanest, to wash their feet, and should much rejoyce in their happy union and growing into one body with us in this Reformation. And let not this Answer for the truth and plainnesse of it, be branded for a bitter, rayling, malitious Answer, but let this also be added to the former premises, that the Apologists needed such an Answer as should not flatter nor extoll them, but be free and plaine; for the truth is the Apologists have been too much flattered both in their persons and Church-way, and they are undone for want of being dealt with plainely and freely; a candle hath been too much held to them, and I hope this Answer may doe much good, even to abate their swellings and confidence, and if many of the Ministers would deale more plainely with them, it would be better both for them and us: I remember a passage of Calv. epist. 65. Melanct. Verum si in nobis omnibus esset is animus qul esse debet aliquod forsan remedium posset inveniti. Et certè foedum exemplum transmi
•…
imus ad posterot, &c.
Calvin in an Epistle of his to Melancthon concerning Luther, which may be applied to the Ministers in reference to the Apologists, how that if there were that mind in all of us which ought to be, some remedy might be found: And certainly we transmit an unworthy example to posterity, whilst we cast away all liberty rather then we will offend one man, and will not his vehemencie the more rise and grow whilst all beare with him and suffer all things, &c.
4. Answ. The writing of Books against the errors and opinions (though of good men) is not speaking against good men, or opposing godlinesse; when the Apologists in their Apologie writ against Authoritative Presbyteriall Government, and in page 
〈◊〉
 and 24 of thei

Accept and take in good part what is now brought to thy hand, as intended for thy spirituall good, for the recovering or preserving thee from errors on the right hand, and let love cover any mistakes or faults thou maist meet with in it. I am but one against five, as also in so many sheets there may well be Errata, and all things not so strong, in much writing a mans pen may slip and mistake, and with long waking a watchfull man may winke now and then; consider also this Answer hath been made in the midst of much preaching and many other businesses, having been destitute also of some advantages and helps which at another time I might have had. Thy good acceptance of it; thy profiting by it, and thy earnest prayers to God for me, will encourage me to goe on in further writing, to which I have so deeply engaged my selfe in this Book; and God sparing me life and health, I have taken up a fixed resolution, never to give over writing till this Church be setled, and these great schismes amongst us healed: But if it should so happen that this Antapologia should profit nothing at all many Christians whom I intend it most unto, yet I question not but it will profit some, even as

Augustine in his Epistle to Vincentius writes, even them who have a care to reade it with the feare of God, and without respect of persons. Now the God of truth and peace reveale abundance of truth and peace, and give us truth and peace always by all meanes; He fulfill that promise in Ieremie, to his people in this Kingdome, to give them one heart and one way to feare him, for the good of them and their children after them: And so commending thee deare Christian to God, and the word of his grace, and this work of mine to his blessing, I conclude this Epistle as Beza doth his to Duditius, Farewell, The Lord keep thee and all thine from all evill, and especially from nooneday Devils, which walke about in this place and in these times, that is, from the errors of Anabaptisme, Brownisme, Antinomianisme, Toleration of Sects and schismes under pretence of libertie of conscience. Amen.
