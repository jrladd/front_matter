AS the Saints
were not after
the fleſh,
ſo the weapons
of their warfare
are not carnall, but
mighty through God,
to bring downe all the

ſtrong holds and mighty
imaginations of divels
and men, plotted
cunningly againſt the
Iſraelites of God; yea,
all the forces of the
fleſh and the world
muſt faint, and fly upon
the uſe of theſe
Armes. Of this compleate
glorious Armature,
Prayer is a ſpeciall
part; yea, it is the
very evergetical manifeſtatiō
of the powof
all the reſt. Jt putteth
on all the other
parts, it keepeth the

whole armature cloſe
to a man, it ſanctifieth
all the reſt to their ſeveral
uſes it guardeth
all the reſt of the golden
furniture from
theeves and robbers,
it daunteth the Divell
and the Divels limbs,
it carrieth the armed
Souldier through out
all forces and furies,
as a victorious Conquerour.
And hence
is that ſaying of the
Ancients, Supplications
and Teares are the
Armes of the Saints. As

the power and excellency
of this ſpirituall
peece is unexpreſſible,
by tongues of men
or Angels; ſo am I the
leaſt of all to be called,
of ſo high & heavenly
a faculty; but
ſince it hath pleaſed
him that hath mercy
on mee to teach mee
the uſe of it, (though
in much weakneſſe,)
and to guide mee as a
weake penſill in his
draught of the truth
of it, to whom ſhould
J then commend it

both for the Touch &
Tuition, but to the
Military Forces of the
new Hieruſalem, who
are experimētally acquainted
with this
peece of proofe? To
you then my deare &
thrice noble Fellow-Souldiers,
the Trained
Band of heaven, the
Artillery men of the
moſt High, I dedicate
my ſelfe and this litle
Treatiſe; accompting
it my only happineſſe
if I be but a doorkeeper
of the Company;

bear with the feebleneſſe
of my hands
in the unſheathing of
this Sword: man you
it with a holy and undaunted
courage, and
it will maintain you.
Times call you all to
the breach, ſtand
cloſe one to another;
hold faſt what yee
have, and let no man
take your Crowne:
Lay about you with
this fiery ſhaking
blade upon all within
you & without you,
that oppoſe Chriſt &

his Kingdome: Walk
worthy of ſo high a
gift; make not this
good commodity to
be ill ſpoken of; part
not with your Armes
and you ſhall overcome.
If theſe my
poor pains may adde
any thing to your skil,
the greateſt recōpence
I crave is to have a
ſhare in your cūning
