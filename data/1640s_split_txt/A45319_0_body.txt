NOthing could fall out more happily to me, then that my bold Adverſaries have appealed to your inviolable Juſtice; for ſure I am, whiles you are (as you ever wilbe) your ſelves, wiſe, and juſt, my cauſe cannot miſcarry in your hands. With no leſſe, therfore, but better grounded confidence, I caſt my ſelf upon your unpartiall judgement; rejoycing to think, how clearly you will diſtinguiſh betwixt a facing boldneſſe, and a modeſt Evidence of truth: How can I but receive

courage from your pious, and juſt proceedings? It is I that vindicate, theſe men oppoſe that holy Leiturgy, which your moſt religious Order in this Active ſeſsion commanded to be intirely obſerved. How buſie Faction is to croſſe that your moſt ſeaſonable Decree, every day yeelds new and lamentable proofs. If theſe indeavours of mine ſerve onely for the purſuance of your ſo neceſſary, and gracious Act; they cannot fear to be unwelcome. But, if I have hurt a good cauſe, by a weak and inſufficient handling, let me ſuffer in your cenſure, and let my Adverſaries triumph in my ſufferings. Contrarily, if after all their ſmooth inſinuations, it ſhall be found, that this champertous combination hath gone about, by meer ſhews of proof, to feed the unquiet humors of men, in the unjuſt diſlike of moſt juſtifiable, ancient, and ſacred Inſtitutions, and to caſt falſe blames upon my peaceable and ſincere managings of a certain Truth, let them paſſe for what they are, and feel that juſtice which they have appealed.
