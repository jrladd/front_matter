BRETHREN, Meeting ye out
of the Aſſembly, or that
bounder appointed ye by Parl.
I cannot juſtly be denied
this reaſoning with ye; for the
Ordinance by which ye ſit, doth
enable ye onely to advice of things propounded,
but not to propound or demand any as ye
have done of late;See Ordin. Jun. 12. 1043. p. 4. ſo as in this ye have brought
your ſelves down to the ſame magnitude with

us that are private men. Here is the difference
now; Ye are many of better parts and abilities;
I am as one born out of due time; yet the
ſame Covenant is upon me with your ſelves,
nor ought I becauſe I am but one, preſume to
ſee Truth more then ye becauſe ye are many;
nor, I hope, ye who are many, will preſume to
ſee Truth more then one, becauſe ye are many;
Nay,2 Pet. 1. 17. it is that voice from the excellent glory
which both you and I muſt hear, and which
can onely teach us Truth; It is not the voice of
any other. And ſurely ſince Truth hath had its
lot in the world to live upon voices in Aſſemblies
and Synods, where that is onely Truth
which is voted ſo; and not in its own glory and
evidence, where that is onely Truth which is
ſo: The Myſtery of iniquity hath been more
advanced then the Myſtery of godlineſſe.
