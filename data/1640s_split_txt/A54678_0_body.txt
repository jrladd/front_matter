MY LORD,


BEE pleased to shed one beame on
these tender sprigs of Lawrell,
which will raise them up to that
growth, that their shadow will
be able to skreen me from the heat
of sensure, I have (through a
throng of other businesse) pressed
so farre as to present them to your view; my zeale to
be knowne to your Lordship (who is knowne to be the
publike Assertor of Letters) oblig'd me to offer them
up to your name, and if you think the sacrifice not worthy
of the Altar, let it be burnt, and the flame of it
will be so happie as to give me light to see my errour

â€¢
hat durst presume to consecrate things of so low an

estimate, without either sap or verdure, to the shelter
of so high a Patron; so shall I (by my humility)
entitle my selfe to your pity, that could not (by my
Poesie) endeare my selfe to your praise; for I know
(my Lord) that your mercy and justice are so equally
wound up together, that you can at once both judge and
forgive, him who shall aspire to no further happinesse
then to be acknowledged
