YOur well known
goodneſſe which
makes you admired &
praiſed by every one,
excited long ſince a deſire
in me to teſtifie unto

the world, and your
ſelf, that though a ſtranger
unto you, yet I was
not ſuch a ſtranger in
the city, but that I had
heard and taken notice
of your daily pious and
charitable workes. So
that this my tranſlation
being to goe forth into
the view of the world,
I have made bold to dedicate
it unto you for
two cauſes. The firſt,

my deſire to make
knowne unto you that
you had an unknowne
ſervant, who had long
wiſhed for ſome opportunity
whereby he
might manifeſt the deſire
he had to tender his
ſervice unto you. The
ſecond, to make this
poore worke more acceptable
to the world,
by prefixing your beloved
name in the front

of it, which is greater
in the worlds eſteeme,
Quam cui poſſit invidia
nocere. Your curteous
and noble mind will (I
hope) not diſdaine the
gift, though ſo ſmal that
it meriteth not ſo great
a Patron: I promiſing
ere long to preſent you
with ſomething which
ſhall bee mine owne
invention. So wiſhing
you many happy daies,

fore-runners of eternal
happineſſe, I reſt,
