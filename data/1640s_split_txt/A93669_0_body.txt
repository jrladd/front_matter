YOur Highneſſe may iuſtly condemne this as a high preſumption, to preſent the moſt eminent King in the Chriſtian World with a diſcourſe of Petitions and Coppies of Letters: but I have found favour in your ſight when I preſented them unto your highneſſe upon more dangerous tearmes, and therefore I truſt that bleſſed Lord will move your heart ſtill to accept of the hearty deſires of your poore ſubject, though they be not clothed with the glorious ornaments of Wiſdome and Eloquence, as was fit to dedicate to the view of ſo learned and judicious a Prince, but my comfort 

is, I ſpeake to a mercifull King, that knowes how to paſſe by infirmities, and to pardon great offences: and ſo beſeeching the Lord God of heaven and earth to bleſſe your Highneſſe with many happy dayes, long to raigne over us to heare the Petitions of your faithfull Subjects, and to redreſſe their wronges, craving pardon for my boldneſſe, I humbly take my leave.
