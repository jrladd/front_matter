I humbly submit) to make me mute, forbidding mee till further order the exercise of my publicke Preaching, wherefore I am faine to imploy my fingers in writing, to make the best signes I can, thereby to expresse, as my desire to the generall good, so my particular gratitude to your Honour.
May this Treatise but finde  the same favour from your Eie, as once it did from your Eare, and be aswell accepted when read, as formerly when heard. And let this humble Dedication be interpreted a weake acknowledgement of those strong obligations your bounty hath laid upon me. Well may you taste the fruits of that tree, whose root your liberality hath preserved from whitheringâ–ª

And to end, as I began, with the example of Zachariah, as his dumbnesse was but temporary; so I hope by Gods goodnesse, and the savour of my friends, amongst whom your Honour stands in the highest ranke, the miracle may be wrought, that the dumbe may speake again, and as well by words publikely professe, as now by his hand, he subscribes himselfe,
