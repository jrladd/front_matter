Right Honourable,


TO whom for your long Travell, variety of Language, and knowne Wisedome, I cannot but give a precedence due to your Person, as a priority belonging to your place; since laboured lines onely comply with judicious eares. I must ingeniously confesse your worth so farre to transcend my weakenesse, that I am almost silent in the Proem ere I enter on the Epitasis: yet presuming on your generous disposition, which ever waiteth on sollid Judgement, I thus proceede.
Your breeding (Right Honourable) next to a Scholler hath beene chiefly in Mercature, and of your sufficiency therein, you have not onely given to this City ample satisfaction; but to the severall parts of this Christian World: your personall Travell in your youth acquainting you with the passages and proceedings in other forraigne regions, have bettered your conceptions (now growing towards Age) in the management of State Magistracy in your native Realme: of which since the time that you were first chosen Alderman, you have given rare President; none having decided more differences, ended

more doubtfull Causes; or beene a greater Peace-maker than your honoured selfe.
And for the multiplicity of your Commerce, it is most manifest, that you have long Traded (to begin with the nearest first) in the Low Countries, France, Spaine, Italy, Venice, East India; and moreover in Greene-land, Muscovy, and Turkey, of which three noble societies last named you are at this present Governour. History tells us that divers Praetors and Tribunes during the time of their Authority, have bin so indulgent over the people committed to their charge; that they have not onely ratified the good Edicts of others, but devised wholsome Ordinances of themselves: when Solon swayed the Senate no Creditor had power over the Debters bodies, but their goods onely. In Platoes Common-weale all excesse was prohibited, which amongst the Romans was cald Lex sumptuaria. Acilius glabrio made an Edict De pecuniis repitundis, Commanding all mony taken by bribery, extortion, or other indirect meanes to bee restored, cald Lex Acilia: Another compelled the Plebe to a liberall contribution towards all publicke Showes, and Triumphs; which was Titled Lex fannia.

But not to indanger the just reproofe of a presumptions arrogance, in prompting your Lordships in the studied Duties of your succeeding charge, I conclude with that Spanish Refran: Embia al sabio a la embaxada, Y no le degat nada; still remembring that of Cato, Imperium gero non miht sed Civitatiet socus.
