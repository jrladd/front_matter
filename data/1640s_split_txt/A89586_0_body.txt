Honorable, and Beloved,


THe holy King and Prophet David, required that the prayſes of God ſhould be ſung upon well tuned Inſtruments; and ſome Pſalmes which himſelf compoſed to that purpoſe, he ſtyled Michtam, golden Pſalms; as being full of precious and choiſe treaſure. Such could I have wiſhed might the Inſtrument have been, and ſuch the Song of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, to have celebrated the goodneſſe of God, for this late wonderfull preſervation of your Honorable Aſſembly, and the famous, and worthy City; both whoſe ruine was plotted and deſigned by wicked and unreaſonable men. But you were pleaſed, not onely to deſigne to this ſervice, a weak and untuned Inſtrument, (though not Crackt, as Malice, and Slander hath bruted it abroad) but alſo

to injoyn the publiſhing of this ſong of Thankſgiving, which is full of weak and imperfect Notes. And to this latter task, I was (I confeſſe) farre more unwilling then to the former; as being conſcious unto my ſelf, how few conceptions could be brought by me to any ſuch maturity, as might render them meet to become the ſtanding Monument of ſo great a Mercy, and ſo happy a Day, which is worthy to be ingraven on Marble, rather then to be written on Paper, and with letters of gold, rather then with ink: But in the purſuance of your Commands I have done it, and added ſome few things, which time nor ſtrength would permit Some few inſtances, clearing the main Doctrin, and ſome in largement of the firſt Uſe. me to deliver in publike; Being reſolved to deny my ſelf, and to do nothing that may hinder me from being what I am, and ſhall always deſire to remain,
