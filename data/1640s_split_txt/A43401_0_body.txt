Great SIR,

THe fancy of my Muse is forc'd to pause.
If that your Honour do require the cause,
'Tis this, I was not able to expresse
In you, what is Great Britains happinesse.
I long was woo'd to write your deserv'd praise,
And by so doing, promis'd was the Bayes,
Which Caesars Virgil wore, but tender yeers
To write that subject, fill'd my Muse with fears;
But yet again a Herberts name did move
Me for to write, and in't expresse my love,
Or rather duty, to your Honours fame,
Who as yet did ne're deserve the least blame,
Which envy would enforce; Pardon I crave,
That is the boon which I alone would have,
From you (great Sir.) Alas I was too bold,
For to write that, I do know you hold
As nothing; it is your sole desire
To inflame England with a zealous fire.
