THough the present paterns of your Royall Parents and lasting Monuments of your famous Ancestors, remaining in Memory to all Posterity may fully and lively de

e, and daily instructions of your grave and learned Teachers and Governours, may most amply expresse the Portraiture of a true perfect and compleat Christian; whereof the one may be said to enforme, the other to enforce you to the imitation of their Heroicall vertues and graces in the Profession of Christianity, the one guiding you by rule, the other by example, that it may seem nothing wanting to make you abound in such heavenly knowledge and Divine Philosophie; yet since Nunquam nimu discitur quod nunquam

satis discitur, and no word is to be accounted out of time that may be spoken profitably, whereby and so accounted of the wiseman as apples of gold in silver or transparant dishes, and more especially since the subject of this discourse and Bafis whereon this Compleat Christian standeth and is founded, so properly pertaineth as by the Lawes appropriated to those of the younger sort, and your Highnesse the head of the Infantery. On whom the eyes of all those Minims of Nobility, and other the younger plants, of this flourishing Kingdom are fixed, and ready to admire your Princely expression: and expresse the imitation of you in their action. Let it not seem strange that I thus present this to you, so properly to the younger sort, and Primarily to your self belonging as Prince of the Youth, and Prime Mirror of all those younger Plants. The next Ages hope the story and glory of succeeding times, or stay and prop of the flourishing of this famous Kingdom; many things and of meane worth are usually and frequently I know offered unto your Highnesse, and you have been pleased to accept of so meane dedication, as of Grammar and other the inferiour sciences: how much more to cast a favourable aspect hitherwards: and to dayne your Graces acceptance

of this Treatise of so high and heavenly a Nature as holy Divinity, the Queene and Mistresse of all other Arts and Sciences, bringing with her, and bestowing on her followers, such ornaments as best suite, from the meanest to the Mightiest, to all the Professors of true Christianity: As this Treatise also may serve, if need were, to make not onely a Complementall, but a Compleat Christian, and afford to all (as we ought to desire the good of all) profit or contentment, profit to the meanest who may learne by it, contentment to those of riper Maturity who can best judge of it, if many of ablest judgement, and Masters in their Profession be not deceived—
Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci.
What the Authour faileth of this and of the generall good, he faileth of his best vote, who heartily desireth the spirituall and best good of all. Such as it is, it lieth prostrate with the Authour himself at your Highnesse feet, onely begging such your gracious favour, as good deservings or best desires do usually finde and obraine at your Princely hands. So tendering his Orisons, at the Throne of Grace, for the aboundant store of all heavenly and earthly blessings, for the continuall increase of your happinesse, as your increase in dayes, to

Crowne and attend you. The due and daily prayers of a faithfull and sworne Servant in that your Royall family, sometime Chaplaine to your worthy and Illustrious Grand Mother of blessed Memory, and no lesse for many other respects, in all dutifull observance to your Highnesse,
