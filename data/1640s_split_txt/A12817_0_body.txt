My very good Lord,


THe Fame of your Lordſhips Heroick Vertues invites me to preſent to your gracious acceptance this Treatiſe, of which Honour is the Theam. Indeed

to whom more fitly can ſhee make her addreſſe, then to your Lordſhip, through whoſe Veins ſhe runs, from whoſe Boſom ſhee flows, in whoſe Actions ſhee ſhines, and by whoſe Protection ſhee is ſecured from the inſolent Affronts of the Vulgar? Being diſtreſſed, ſhee makes You her faire Sanctuarie, being wounded, ſhe makes you her ſoveraigne Balme. Nay, (which draweth neere to a wonder) many put their Honour into Your hands, eſteeming it more ſafe there, then in their owne. This is the firſt cauſe of my Dedication; The next is, that the true Child of Honour (the deplored Subject of this Book) was a Debtor to Your Lordſhip for his Education, whoſe Advancement in Vertue, Honour, and Eſtate; You made the greateſt part of Your Studie. And,

to ſay the Truth, where could ſuch a Guardian be found for him as Your Lordſhip, ſince between the renowned Anceſtours of You both, Vertue, and Bloud hath long ſince engendred a ſtrict Friendſhip, and between whom there was a neare ſimilitude of good and evill Deſtiny, both having amply ſhared of Infortunity, and Glory?

whoſe Perfections are ſo many, and ſo tranſcendent, that they are able not onely to adorn theſe more Poliſht Parts of the World, but to civilize alſo the more Barbarous, and to make an Athens of Madagaſcar. The Oblation of my Teares, and Supplications to God, not availing to keep him here, J have ſent my Vowes after him, and have given him a Funerall Equipage conſiſting of the Teſtimonies of brave, good, and knowing Men, which will eternize him on Earth, as his Goodneſſe will in Heaven. I, confeſſe freely, I was unwilling to leave him to the Mercy of ſome groſly ignorant Chronologer of the Times, in whoſe Rubbiſh, Poſteritie might unhappily have found him lying more ruin'd then his glorious Predeceſſours were by the

Tyranny of Time, or the Cruelty of Princes. Now in the last place, I muſt moſt humbly beſeech Your Lordſhip to take notice, that his whole Name have made an affectionate, but an imprudent Choice of me to be their weak Oratour, to render Your Lordſhip ſubmiſſive, and due thanks for the Good You did, or intended him, and withall to make You a Religious Promiſe of their Prayers to God, and their Prayſes; to Men, as in particular, I doe of the vowed faithfull ſervice of
