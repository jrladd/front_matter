May it pleaſe your Honour,


TO admit this Act of Recordation, that 'tis full Fourteene yeares ſince the happy Aſpect of your gracious Favour did reflect upon me, for my good both by Sea, and Land:

which left in me ſuch an Impreſsion of the Character of your Noble and Religious Diſpoſition, that to this very Day edgeth a freſh deſire to take this advantagious (though in another reſpect, a ſad) Opportunity to teſtifie my dutifull reſpect to your Honour. It may be, this Art of Building Comfort is not ſo artificially, and laboriouſly compoſed, as you have heard, and was pleaſed to countenance ſome Vniverſitie-Pieces of mine: there might be more oyle beſtowed on them, to varniſh the Face of their ſtyle; but this Treatiſe is allowed more Wine to comfort the Heart of the Reader. This induced me to preſent to your gracious Acceptation, this Earneſt of that Debt of Thankfulneſſe, wherein both your Favours, and Deſerts (tàm Arte, quàm Marte) have bound me to you: a ſmall Earneſt is ſufficient to binde the greateſt Contract 'twi
•
t a bountifull hand, and a thankfull Heart. Let this be ſuch of my Gratitude, and not onely a Pledge of Mine, but a Remembrance of Hers, (I meane my dead

Wife) whoſe Living Thankfulneſſe to God for your Favours to me, you had, though not made knowne unto you. And if your more then ordinary Employments will permit you to read over, either Her deſerved Commendation: or Her Epitaph which is much too narrow for her worth, (both are in the adjoyning Pages) then I hope your Lordſhip will have no cauſe to repent the Dedication of this Treatiſe. In the meane time my Experimentall knowledge, that in you the Nobilitie of Deſcent and Minde concurre: the Eminencie of Parts in your ſelfe, and Affabilitie of Diſpoſition to others do mutually reflect each on the other: which Harmonie may well challenge this my voluntary Oblation, as a neceſſary Obligation, that for ever tyes me to fixe my Devotions on Heaven, and heartily to pray for your temporall, ſpirituall, and eternall Happineſſe.
