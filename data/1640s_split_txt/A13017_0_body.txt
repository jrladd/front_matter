Right Honorable,



A
 Debtor I acknowledge my ſelfe unto the Church of God by calling, & a ſpeciall

ingagement lieth upon me, both of truſt and promiſe to ſerve the Church in this way, in bringing towards the furtherance of the building of it, that which hath beene ſquared and framed to my hand by a wiſe Master builder, who hath ſhowed himſelfe approved unto God, a workeman that needeth not to be aſhamed. This I doe here humbly preſent unto your Honours protection; I may perhaps from ſome, incurre the cenſure of too much boldneſſe in uſing

your Honours name, but your courteſie and ſweet affabilitie ſpringing from your native gentelneſſe of diſpoſition doth ſecure me: and the rather ſince I preſent this unto your Honour, not in my owne name, but in the name and behalfe of the Widdow, who though ſhe may claime the priviledge of her Sex from appearing in Print herſelfe, yet ſhee is deſirous that the living and laſting Monuments of her deare huſband ſhould be brought

forth for the good of Gods Church, under the patronage and protection of your Honour, to whom the Author was every way ſo much oblieged; now I have no reaſon to doubt but that as your Honour was pleaſed to take the Reverend and learned Author into the protection of your noble family, for you will bee pleaſed to countenance theſe his owne legitimate children, which are now ſent abroad as Orphans deprived of their father.

Their owne worth cannot but gaine them eſteeme, but I know your Honour will prize them the more for their fathers ſake: who whileſt hee was alive did ſecure your Honour by his Prayers which he did daily offer up to God, not pro forma as a legall and dead ceremony, but pro Anima, as a ſpirituall and lively ſacrifice, in the behalfe of your honour and happineſſe, and now that he is dead yet ſpeaketh in theſe and thoſe other

Sermons of his which beare your honours name. If you be pleaſed to patronize, countenance and peruſe them, they will reflect much brightneſſe upon your nobleneſſe, as they receive ſplendour from it. Thus under your Honours protection I doe preſent them unto the world, humbly craving the priviledge of your pardon for my boldneſſe, and heartily beſeeching the Lord to mak you ſtill and ſtill to doe worthily in Iſrael and

to inrich your Honour more and more with grace here and glory hereafter.
