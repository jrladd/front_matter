 Doubt not but there are many amongſt you, Right Honourable and Worthy Citizens; yea, very many who ſeriouſly ſet their faces towards Sion; The whole Kingdome hath abundantly taſted the excellent fruites of your reall forwardneſſe in this good way. Travellers are uſually as glad of Guides, as of Companions, eſpecially in doubtfull wayes: And wee are fallen among ſo many Queſtioniſts, and ſuch thick miſts of ſtrange Doctrines, obſcuring the good way ſo much, that we had need ſeeke cleere direction, otherwiſeMany miſts of new opinions which much puzzle Travellers. wee may ſoone be at a loſſe. We heare of Antinomians who deny the Law, to bee a rule of life to Saints: Wee heare of Socinians, who in a manner overthrow the Goſpel, denying the ſatisfaction of Chriſt: We heare of Arminians, who undermine the Covenant of Free-grace, that they may gratifie Free-will: We heare of Anabaptiſts, who with-hold Baptiſme the Seale of that Covenant from the Infants, even of ſuch as are in Covenant: We heare of others, who queſtion the Truth of our Church, and of our Miniſtry, in and by which ſo many thouſand ſoules have been new borne to God: Yea, we heare of ſome grown to

that deſperate height, that they ſay, there is no need of Miniſtry or Ordinances, flattering us with hope of new Apoſtles, & glorious diſcoveries by them. Hereby Religion is much mangled, and well meaning minds not a little diſtracted, which way to take. It is the Miniſters worke to warne againſt enemies, to direct

What ſparkes of light this plaine Sermon holds forth, were at firſt blowne up by your deſire, and now by your importunity being made Publike are kept burning. The good Lord (who deſpiſeth not the day of ſmall things) quicken your Spirits hereby in Heaven-way; I ſhall heartily rejoice if your attention in hearing, ſhall be ſeconded with intention in acting over that Counſell wh

In theſe times of Reformation we ſhould bee often put in mind, to ſtand, ſee, inquire: As in building we beware of miſtakes in the foundation; In Phyſicke, of errors in the firſt concoction; in both theſe they are dangerous, becauſe hardly corrigible; So in journeys we ſhould wiſely watch againſt erring, both at our firſt ſetting out, and eſpecially when we come to a great turning, if then we miſtake the right way, we ſhall not eaſily recover. How carefull was Ezra to ſeeke of God a right way, when he was going from Babylon to Jeruſalem? Hee proclaimed a Faſt for that purpoſe at the River Ahava, and that a moſt religiousEz

in Faſting and Praying; that being come to ſo great a turning, upon ſo grand a change in the Church of England, wee may cleerly find the good old way: Wee muſt expect SatanZach 3. 1. who ſtood at Joſhuahs right hand to reſiſt him, when hee was about Temple-worke, will now uſe all his methods to p

New-England affords us a ſad inſtance of this policy. A worthy Divine of their owne tells us, by what ſleights the Antinomians, Familiſts, and Libertines, infected the Churches there, As they would lift up themſelves, (ſaith hee) ſo alſo theirSee Mr. Well
