My very honourable Lord,


THe many noble favours which I have received from your Lordſhip chiefly, and from others of your noble Family, compell mee (ſince theſe Sermons will needs be publike, beyond my intentions) to adde to them the honour of your Lordſhips name; and to ſet upon them this Seal of Gratitude, from a heart that unfainedly prayes for all thoſe encreaſes to your Lordſhip and yours, which may make both your Lordſhip and them truly honourable in this,

and ever happy in the other world: For ſo I muſt profeſſe to all the world, your Nobleneſſe hath abundantly deſerved of your Lordſhips moſt humble, and obliged Servant,
