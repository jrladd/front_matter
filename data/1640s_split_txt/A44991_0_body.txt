MADAM,


NOne can wonder that I
bring these EMBLEMS
under your Protection.
For I and this Book have
acquir'd so near a Relation, that
I must (for my own sake,) do it
what good I can: And the best way
I know to advance it's condition,

is to prefix your Name. Had they
been high Discourses of the best
Philosophy (whether Ancient or
Moderne,) or choice pieces of
Philologie, I should have offered
them to your noble Husband
Mr. THOMAS STANLEY, whom
our Island stands admiring to see
him now (as once the great Alexander)
conquer the world, when
'tis scarce thirty years since first he
came into it; There being no glory
that Greece or Rome, or their
Successors can boast, which his
matchlesse Genius hath not made
his own, and ours too, by a noble
communication. Therefore to
him also I inscribe these EMBLEMS.
I am bold thus to present them, that
as Chappells (which before were
but Lime and Stone) they may

grow venerable by their Dedication:
and Likewise be an Emblem
of the humble respect and services
of

MADAM
