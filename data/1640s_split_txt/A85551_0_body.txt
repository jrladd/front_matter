SIR;


AS formerly I have acquainted you with two ſmall Treatiſes, which were dedicated to his MAJESTIE and the Right Honorable the High Court of Parliament, ſo now I have preſumed on Chriſtian affection, to dedicate this victory of Truth to your religious view and meditation. The odds in the conflict was much ten to one, and every one of them being roots of a thouſand branches, even ſo many in number, and ſo groſſe in nature, that if I ſhould ſpeak all I know of them, it might ſeeme incredulous to your exerciſed and experienced judgement, and prejudicious unto many that want the like knowledge and diſcernment, ſo that for this time I thought thus briefly to diſarme the Leaders, that ſo the following multitude of the Army may have premonition before the time come that all the enemies of

Chriſt ſhall be ſlaine before him, and the ſecrets of all manner of hearts diſcovered. And for my own particular, Sir, finding the boldneſſe and impudency of error, as well as the multiplicitie, whereby the whole Citie is in every part and place infected, and from thence, as from a fountain, the Countryes alſo, I could reſt no longer ſilent, for as much as God of his own goodneſſe and infinite mercy, hath been pleaſed to communicate and impart the knowledge of the myſtery of his Word unto me in ſome meaſure, notwithſtanding my own unworthineſſe and weakneſſe: this truth received in my heart, hath been as a fire which I could no wayes hinder from burning into a flame, through the light whereof, by the means of your grave and prudent countenance, he that reads it may have information of the evill and error without prefigured, and within this Treatiſe manifeſtly revealed; as alſo the good and happineſſe of truth, the old path and ſtraight way of the Lord, in ſome meaſure opened and declared; to which all that are not of the houſhold of faith are ſtrangers, and moſt of them perverters. And Sir, I pray of one thing take notice in the figure, that he that is moſt obſcure in his perſon, is moſt dangerouſly ſubtill and myſterious in his doctrine; and at this very time, in which you ſit in Parliament, with the whole Counſell of the Kingdome, he doth more hurt in one houre then in ten heretofore; his badge is F. Wherefore Right Wor: be pleaſed to take notice of the Churches enemies, and let the deſpiſed and perſecuted wife of Chriſt, and her little children, have your love, helpe, and aſsiſtance. Theſe are all that are intreated for to be granted by you, moſt vertuous and noble Senator, to him that is your faithfull and humble ſervant,
