IF ever it was true, it is now, That
Scribimus indocti, docti



que

 So that it
may grow almoſt a queſtion,
whether now the Sword, or Pen is
moſt buſie? or more effuſion of Ink, or Blood?
What here offers it ſelf to your view, comes

from a modeſt and peaceable hand and
heart, and meerly relative to the good of
thoſe Countries, whoſe happineſs I am confident
you prefer before any particular intereſt.
Conceptions of this kinde I have not
yet ſeen any; and though (praiſed be God)
our hands are pretty well reſtrained, yet that
our hearts be wholly purged of the old poyſon,
there is ſome ſlender endeavour to inform
our Country-men with the right underſtanding
of the Parliament, and its principles,
and clear demonſtrations of Gods
ſpeciall providence and goodneſſe in its preſervation;
ſo that to harbour a thought againſt
it, we muſt take heed we be not found
To fight againſt God:
Act. 5. I confeſſe them but a
rude heap of thoughts; I have laboured to be
Seneca his Scholar, and in writing to obſerve
his rule, not ſo much the Quemadmodum, as
the Quid, being aſſured None can be more
eloquent, then he that hath well conceived a
Truth; It is with things of this kinde, as
with burthens of the womb that are teemed
with perturbations and dangers, they prove
leſſe thriving; and what is here might have
appeared more comely, had they not been

conceived at ſuch times and places, when
and where indeed I durſt not ſcarce owne
them as Thoughts. Worthy Sirs, whatever
they are, they implore your favourable acceptance,
they court neither for praiſe nor
preferment; If the poore Author may not
ſtill be under the inſultation of our old enemies,
Mutato nomine, and enjoy but Common
Iuſtice, it is the Apex of his deſires: I would
not be behinde for my poore Mite to further
the great work, which (bleſſed be God)
I hope I may ſay is a finiſhing, wherein I,
not unlike that Bird, (that is fabled) when
the Kings of Aſia contributed great treaſures
to the building of a Temple, it having no
other wealth, went thither to preſent her
Feathers.

Truth was never without adverſaries, but
never more mortall ones then now. You
may ſee I have drawn in its quarrel: You are
Gods champions, and its; I humbly beg
I may not ſuffer, but let your countenance
and protection be at hand, and I ſhall humbly
pray, that as He hath ſingled you to be
Inſtruments of His glory here, you may ſo

act, and honour Him, that hath ſo honoured
you, that you be partakers of His glory and
bliſſe for evermore.
The Prayer of him who ever hath been, and will
be ever really devoted to You in this great ſervice
of GOD and his Country,
