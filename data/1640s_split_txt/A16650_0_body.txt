TO all modest Dames
From TWEDE unto THAMES,

Who prize their good names above Nectar;
With a Paphian kisse
Doe I tender them this
To silence a Canopy Lecture.



TO you, this Booke may well addressed bee
Since none from Bolster Lectures is more free:
Be you then patronesse without offence,
And with a smile returne me recompence.
