Moſt Sacred and Reverend Divines,


I Have but the thoughts of an Afternoone to
ſpread before you; for I Examined the ſame
Pace that I read, that if it were poſſible
a Truth might overtake an Errour, ere it goe too farre.
It is not a little Encouragement that I may ſit like the
Propheteſſe under the Palme tree, under ſuch a
Shade as your ſelves, and what weakeneſſe ſoever
may appeare in theſe my Aſſertions: This ayring them
under your Patronage, will heale them. For ſo they

brought forth the ſick into the ſtreets, that at
leaſt the ſhadow of Peter might touch ſome of
them. Thus have I ſuddenly ſet up my Candle for
others to Light their Torch at; and, I hope, you will
pardon me, if my Zeale to the Truth made me ſee Anothers
faults ſooner then mine Owne,
