Madam,


THough it bee unlawfull to offer up sacrifices to the dead, yet license me to sacrifice these Elegies to the memory of your Sonne, and permit me to make his name an Altar, though not his Tombe. Those reciprocall endearments which at first fed and fomented our friendship, have made such an impression on all those faculties that officiate to my Soule, on all those functions that hold Correspondence with Invention and Phansie, that I should not onely seeme ungratefull, appeare unfruitfull, but also supinely forgetfull, if I should not endeavour by consecrating some Trophie (though nere so rude and inconsiderable) to his remembrance, to redeeme and rescue it from the Vault, and so preserve it, that it might never be rak'd up amongst his ashes. And though peradventure those benefits that hee shed on others, fell but upon barren and unthankfull ground, yet those he powr'd upon

me, have not languish'd into oblivion, but teem'd with a gratefull acknowledgement: Death onely by usurping his life too soone excluded me from inlarging my Gratitude to himselfe, that I might professe it to you, who shall bee the Delegate to receive the payment of a Debt I ow'd to your Sonne, which shall be done with a Devotion as emphaticall as that which excites mee to send up my Orizons to Heaven for your happinesse in this world, and before inspir'd mee to powre forth my prayers for your Sons glory in the other. Madam, if you thinke that these low expressions of my zeale and Monuments of my Affection can improve your Sonnes memory to any perpetuity, suffer them I beseech you to give themselves up to your view, since you may ascertaine your selfe that they issue from one whose entire study is, whose whole practise shall be, how hee may declare himselfe,
