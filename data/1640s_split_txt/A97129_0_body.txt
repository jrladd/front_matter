RIght Worſhipfull, and the reſt of my friends and acquaintance,
I here preſent you with a ſhort Relation of the taking of Wincheſter;
which is (though eaſily accompliſht, yet) worth the hearing.
I confeſſe theſe are not times for men to ſpend in writing
or reading Hiſtories: But this being matter of diſcouragement
to the foe, and of great encouragement to us, I thought good to
divulge: and ſo much the rather, becauſe I know it hath beene publiſhed already
by a falſe Copie, which mentions the enemies iſſuing out of the City to meet us;
which is no ſuch matter, and deſerveth a checke rather then approbation. Worthy
Gentlemen, the reſpect and duty that I owe to you all, doth enforce me to make this
Dedication to you, knowing you all to be Patrons to all vertuous actions, in the
Towne where I was borne, and well-wiſhers to me: and therefore I preſume, that
though it be but ſlenderly compos'd, (the Subject being a known truth, and I your
native Countriman as well in affection as by birth) you will with the more tenderneſſe
paſſe by any blurre committed in the penning thereof, and cenſure more favourably
of my blunt and weake expreſſions. And no queſtion but that you (ſetting
Wincheſter before you for an example) will with the more courage and unwearied
reſolution defend your (yet unplunder'd) Corporation from the barbarous
cruelty, and from the ambitious pride and inſolency of ſo deſtructive an enemy;
who if he once enters will leave you nothing to take pleaſure in, but the ruines of
an once flouriſhing Corporation. Thus barring complements, I remaine your muſt
affectionate and faithfull friend,
