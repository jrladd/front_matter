MY LORD,

BEing confident, that your gracious
disposition will hold in greater account
the ingenuous meaning of who gives,



then the sufficiency of the present: I here
tender to the favour of your Honours acceptance
a bundle of Epigrams; Which
though they be but flashes of wit, and such,
as may with advantage receive point from
your ordinary conceptions: yet for that nothing
doth better recommend them, then vivacitie
of conce
â€¢
t, I cannot figure to my fancie a fitter
Patron to protect the sublimest Poems of this
Nature, then your owne Noble selfe; of whose
valour, and prudence, even from your infancie,
both this, and forraine Nations will afford
an approbation so Authentick, that by the universall
consent of all, that ever knew your
Lordship, the depth of experience since the memory
of man was never seene wedded to fewer
yeares: nor the splendor of heroicke vertue to
the astonishment of whole Armies, and Princes
Palaces, more evidently apparent, then in
the magnanimity of your generous carriage.
What formerly, by the most vertuous, and
pregnant wits, could not bee acquired without
a long continuance of time: and was esteemed
to be incompatible with youth (and much
more extraordinary in young gallants, then
gray haires, or the Gout) hath beene still in
your Lordship, a quality concomitant to the
source of all your actions: coaevall with the
gentile powers of your mind: and no lesse naturall,



then to speake, or thinke.
And what others, not being able to reach
into (have therefore admired in the Legend
of the Worthies) hath, since the yeares of discretion,
bin the constant Object of your dailie
exercise, and complyed with your very most
neglected cogitations: Which glorious, and
rare endowments, out-reaching the extent of
vulgar goodnesse, and seeming the more wonderfull,
that it is not long since by your
birth, you did grace the World with the honour
of your presence, doe possesse the faculties of my
soule with a stedfast resolution, so unfainedly
to acknowledge the absolute right, your Lordship
hath over me, and the inclinations of my
mind: that, as I cannot impart that portion
of the fruits thereof to any, which by a prior
disposition is not already yours: so may not I
(though the matter be but small) without
breach of duty, devote this Dedication to another.
Therefore (my Lord) you may be pleased, according
to your accustomed manner, to vouchsafe
a courteous entertainment to this testimony
of my regard: till Fortune be so favourable,
as to blesse me with the opportunity, one
day to make knowne my designments more effectually
yours; for the best of my affections, being
touched with the Magnetick vertue of your
good parts, are fixed on you, as on their Pol-estar



which serveth to direct the course of my life
in a continuall progresse of embracing all
the occasions, whereby I may testifie,
how earnest I am, and alwayes
shall be, deservingly to obtaine
the title
Of
Yours
My Lord
in all humilitie of sincere
respect, to serve your
Lordship.
