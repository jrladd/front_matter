SIR,


IT hath pleas'd your Highneſſe to command this Sermon to the Preſſe, and me to be your ſervant: what you have obſerv'd from either, that might incline you to ſo much grace & favour, I know not; unleſſe it were my plaine dealing with the Times. This (indeed)

your Highneſſe mentioned with a deep ſence and reliſh. VVould God the mad world knew it. Certainly it were enough to ſtop the foul mouthes of ſome: enough to warme the honeſt hearts of others. God Almighty ſo compoſe the preſent troubles of this State, that the Government thereof may ſtand the ſurer for this ſhaking; and continue and increaſe his graces in you for the glorious ſupport thereof, when it ſhal pleaſe him to lay it upon your ſhoulders.
