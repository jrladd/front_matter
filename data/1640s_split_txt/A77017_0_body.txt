IF that (much honoured Sir) I ſhould here prefix any long narration in commendation of your Worth, I ſhould of ſome be ſuſpected of flattery; of all it would ſeeme a thing ſuperfluous, ſeeing it ſufficiently commends it ſelfe? ſuch is your Worth, that who ſo readeth you throughout, cannot but entertain honourable and pious thoughts of you: your deſerts of Gods Church, your ſingular zeale, your unfained faith, your ſincere profeſsion, your eſpeciall care to advance Gods glory, and to root out Papiſtry, your conſtant faithfulneſſe to your King and Parliament, hath beene ſuch, that this Kingdome generally, but the County of Berks eſpecially (your native ſoyle) have and ſhall have great cauſe to bleſſe God for you; hoping yet better and greater things; and that their hopes may meet with fruition, they have joyntly with one heart and tongue choſen you, (being worthy double honour) Knight of the ſhiere; and which juſtly ſpeaks obſervation, no negative voice heard; which clearly proclaimes to the world, your ſenſible goodneſſe

and deſerts for the time paſt; Their great and glorious hope, that the Lord will make You an inſtrumentall Bleſſing, not onely to the whole Realme, but eſpecially to them ana their County, for the future. Now, that this expectation may come into their hands, you have the tongues and hearts of all; of all, except ſome few of Nadabs and Abihu's ſect, ſuch as offer often times ſtrange fire upon Gods Altar; they indeed breath out flames endeavouring to ſinge and ſearch you, your viſible goodneſſe, and apparent vertues: oh, what will not Ignorance and Malice, (eſpecially if infected with our Kingdoms new diſeaſe) dare attempt? what ſpeech of wiſedome can be ſo diſcreetly uttered, but it may by Ignorance be depraved? what action of vertue can be ſo exactly performed, but it may through Malice be miſ-conſtrued? It is not more proper to God to bring light one of darkeneſſe, than it is naturall for the Devill and his turbulent Imps out of the light of truth to endeavour to draw darkeneſſe of errour, and out of the beſt ſpeeches and actions to ſtraine and force out ſomewhat, to maintaine and nouriſh their corrupt humours and boſome ſinnes. And what marvell? ſith even in Paradiſe amidſt the ſweeteſt flowers and herbs a Serpent could live▪ and find there ſomething to feed upon, turning the

 of thoſe ſoveraigne and medle ſhall ſimples into poyſon; but expelling theſe, I haſten unto that whereof I am chiefly to ſpeake.
I am, honoured Sir, as full of hope as deſire, that your countenance will helpe into the light, this baſhfull piece of my compoſure? your Affection, and more then common kindneſſe unto me hath emboldened mee to beſeech that you will Patroni

e this firſt fruit of my endeavours; as I ſhall not here remember all the favours wherewith I have been honoured, ſo can I not forget to mention ſome, eſpecially thoſe reflections and gliſſonings (which in due reſpect to you) ſhone on me, from that great ſtarre lately

fallen (the able and reverend Doctor, the faithfull and worthy Prolocutor Maſter William Twiſſe) as, his laſt judicious and elaborate Book, which he ſo willingly gave me with his own hand; his thinking me Worthy (though unworthy) to ſucceed him as Paſtor of Newbury, ſigned with his own hand; his giving me the free uſe of his rich and learned Library; under the Sunſhine of theſe beams (darted on me (right Worſhipfull) for your ſake) have I lately lived; ſo that, it may be expected ſomewhat of mine ſhould be coloured with them. indeed the Argument being an Aſſembly act, might therefore claim a peculiar intereſt in a Prolocutours religious Protection; but the former cauſes have invited, nay inforced me, humbly to deſire yours: Whoſe protection ſhould I rather beg then his that hath made me happy both in affection and action? ſuch is your known goodneſſe, as that it is not onely extended to me, but faſtened on all thoſe that ſincerely feare God (which makes the publick Good) with affections (like the beames of the Sun) immutable, unchangeable; marke the rayes of the viſible Sunne, how conſtant they are, being not moved at all by the motion of the object, but immoveably flowing from the Body of the Sunne, though bluſtering winds tyrannize in the ayre, and remove it a thouſand times out of his place in an houre, yet the Sunne beames keepe their object which they enlighten, and ſtirre not at all; in like manner, your affections (honoured Sir) like thc beames of the Sunne remaine unmoveable where they are once fixed, though bluſtering winds have tyrannized, and toſſed You, your Perſon, your good-name, your moſt godly, moſt humble, and devout Lady, your well-governed Family, your great eſtate, &c. yet your pious heart and religious affections have remained unmoveable; witneſſe your cheerfull conſtancy to your Chriſt and his cauſe from the firſt to the laſt; this is that which (more eſpecially) adds unto my

hopes; nay, its that that makes me confident, that theſe few labours will find a gracious acceptance being humbly preſented to your Indulgency and Gentleneſſe. I conclude, fearing prolixity; the Lord of Heaven bleſſe you, and grant as you have beene heretofore faithfull, juſt, and wiſe; ſo you may continue to the glory of God, the increaſing of his Church, and the profit of his People.
