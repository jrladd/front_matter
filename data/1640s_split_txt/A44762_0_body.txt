SIR,


I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me, called the Popish Royall Favorite; and according to your advice (which I value in a high degree) I put pen to paper, and something you may see I have done (though in a poore pamphleting way) to cleare my selfe of those aspersions that are cast upon me therein. But truly Sir, I was never so unfit for such a task; all my Papers, Manuscripts, and Notes, having been long since seized upon and kept from me. Adde hereunto, that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three Moneths close restraint (the sense wherof, I find hath much stupified my spirits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sicknes, a high burning feaver, with the new disease, whereof my Body as well as my Mind is yet somewhat crazie: so that (take all afflictions together) I may truly say, I have passed the Ordeal, the fiery Tryall. But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see better dayes I hope; for out of this fatall black Cloud, which now oresets this poore Island, I hope there will breake a glorious Sun-shine of peace and firme happinesse: To effect which, had I a Jury, a grand-Jury of lives, I would sacrifice them all, and triumph in the oblation.
So I most affectionately kisse your hands, and rest


From the Prison of the Fleet.
