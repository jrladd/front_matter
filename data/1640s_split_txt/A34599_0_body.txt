Sir,


1 Cor. 14 27
THe Churches of the Saints
and the World, may not
bee unfitly compared to
the Pearle and the Pebble:
though both of one naturall
ſubſtance, earth; yet the one of
rare price, whoſe beauty is the ſunbeames
incloſed; the other wanting

it, is caſt away as refuſe. What
maketh the Saint more excellent
then his neighbour, ſeeing both are
borne of fleſh, both ſubject to the
ſame corruptions, ſickneſſe, death,
but this?Epheſ. 4. 24 The Saints excellency is
nothing elſe but the Image of Jeſus
Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe
ſhining in him: For as the moone
and ſtarres derive their light from
the ſunne;1 Cor. 1. 30 ſo all the wiſdome, righteouſneſſe,
holineſſe a Saint hath,
hee deriveth from Chriſt. Hence
David the King doth ſo prize their
fellowſhip, All my delight is in thy
Saints,
Pſal. 16. 3.
thine excellent ones that are in
the earth, and them that excell in vertue.
Yea, it is a ſure note of a Citizen
of Sion, that hee honours them
that feare the Lord:
Pſal 15. Whereas worldly
men without grace, are rendred
in his eyes as vile. Hence the Spouſe
acknowledgeth that all her excellency
cometh from plantation; Let
my Beloved come into his garden,
Cant 4 16.
and
eat his pleaſant fruit. Yea, Chriſt

declareth to Nicodemus that a beleevers
holineſſe cometh from regeneration;
Joh. 3. 5.
that in Chriſt hee may
onely glory. How doth the Lord
diſcover this his excellency to a
beleever, by his calling, till that
time hee lieth amongſt the refuſe
of the world,Tit. 3. 3. as fooliſh, diſobedient,
deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,
living in malice and envie, hatefull,
and hating one another. But then
the kindneſſe and love of God to
man appeared,Col. 1. 13. by delivering him out
of the kingdome of darkneſſe, and tranſlating
him into the kingdome of his
deare Sonne. By which it is manifeſt,
that hee is one of the Choſen generation,
the royal prieſthood,
1 Pet. 2. 9. the holy nation,
the peculiar people, whom hee
hath called out of darkneſſe into his marvellous
light. But when doth the
Lord diſcover the truth of his calling
to his conſcience? Then when
hee giveth him precious faith; for
that onely diſtinguiſheth him form
the world that lieth in ſinne. Gal. 3.

22. The Scripture concludeth (father,
mother, ſonne, daughter, nay the
infant that is borne of the moſt
holieſt parents) all under ſinne, that
the promiſe by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt
might bee given to them that beleeve.
So that in that ſame houre the Lord
giveth him faith, hee giveth him
an evidence in himſelfe,Heb 15. 1. that hee
loved him in Chriſt before he was
borne,Rom 9 11. before hee had done good
or evill,Act. 13. 39.
