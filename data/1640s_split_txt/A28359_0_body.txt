SIr, 'twas not the hope of
adding either to your houour,
or my owne profit,
(but my certaine knowledge
of the encouragement
which any pious endeavours
ſhall receive
from your religious ſelfe)
that made me not hazzard, but preſume on your
acceptance: were my Poſition contrary to what it
is, I might then be ſencible of a fear, and ſuſpect
its welcome; becauſe I am confident that nearneſſe
of relation cannot bribe your judgment, no not to

purchaſe but a ſlight view from your obſerving eye.
But being as it is, no way contradictory to what I
affirmed before: I hope it will not breed in you the
leaſt ſuſpition of a change in my affections: Sir my
hope of your acceptance, is not grounded upon the
agitation of ſo poore a principle, as that of Kindred,
for I am ſure that your judicious and alwayes juſt
cenſure, will not be pleaſed with that from me,
which from another would prove diſtaſtefull; therefore
(for my part) I ſhall not be refractory, but ſubmit
to your profound judgement, and whether you
approve or diſprove, I ſhall ſtill remaine what I
ever was,
