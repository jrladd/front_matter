Right Honorable,


MY respects unto you (being your Honours ingaged many wayes) have put me upon a designe or project for you; the God of Heaven graciously prosper it in my hand. The tenour of it is briefly this: to encrease your honour, and to ease the burden of that laborious government, which now lyeth upon your shoulder.
To mention your name before the glorious labour of so great and worthy

an agent in the factorage of Heaven (as the Author of this piece was) and to make you a Protector of them: cannot (I conceive) in sober interpretation, but be conceived, to adde honour unto him that hath, and cause him to have more abundantly. Blessed is the wing that is spread over any of the things of Iesus Christ to shelter them.
Againe, to put into your hand, and from your hand into your heart, the remembrance of that God, that will gloriously recompence your faithfulnesse in that great trust committed to you, cannot but (by the blessing of him to whom blessing belongeth) be a cordiall meanes to strengthen your heart in the pange of government, and cause you to travaile and bring forth with more ease. There is no labour, nor travaile, nor sorrow, nor difficultie, nor danger, nor death that hath any evill or bitternesse in it, when Heaven is before us, and the truth and faithfulnesse

of the living God embracing us.
If I have miscaried in point of good manners, or otherwise in this Dedication, your Honour shall doe but justice to charge your owne courtesie and respects alwayes shewed unto mee, (at least in part) with the blame of it. Had not there beene the tempter, doubtlesse in this case I had not beene the transgressour. The God of peace prosper the government of this great Cittie in your hand; and make it a glorious rise and advantage unto you of your greater glory in the Heavens. And your Honour may assure your selfe that so it shall come to passe, unlesse that God that heareth prayer shall reject the prayer of,
