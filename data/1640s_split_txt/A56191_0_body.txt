And Faiths Defender againſt Romes proud

Vouchſafe to caſt Your Gracious Princely eye

On theſe unpoliſh't Poems; which deſcry,

Refute ſome foule, groſſe Errors, Practiſes
Of Romes falſe Church. By one ſhort view of theſe,
Your Highneſſe may conjecture of the reſt,
And be ſtirr'd up for ever to deteſt

With greateſt Zeale, Romes Errors, Blaſphemies;
Which make good hearts with indignation riſe
Againſt them. Great Jehovah Crowne and bleſſe

Your Highneſſe with all kindes of Happineſſe;
And, through Your Favour, make this PVRGE of uſe,

So prayeth,
