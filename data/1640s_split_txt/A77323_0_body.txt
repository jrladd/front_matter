Worthy Sir:


I Have in my troubles (among other
things) obſerved that when the
LordJob 12. 5. deprives a man of the
ſuperfluous things of this life,
Lam. 3. 2. and brings him into diſtreſſe,Pro. 19. 7. his friends
and acquaintance are then wanting unto him,
Pſal. 38. 11. they ſtand aloofe,Job 10. 1. and leave him to himſelfe,
being (in their opinions) in ſo miſerable
a ſtate and condition;Deut. 8. 5. this is the uſuall manner
of Gods dealing with thoſe whom he loves,
for by this means,2 Cor. 4. 16. though the outward man
periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by
day. But when the Lord is graciouſly pleaſed to
Jonah. 4. 6. deliver the party afflicted from his griefe,Pſal. 90. 15.
he is exceeding glad, and then hisJob 42. 11. friends
and acquaintance rejoyce with him, and expreſſe
their love and affections towards him in
a bountifull manner:Pſal. 116. 5, 6. this have I (through
Gods goodneſſe) knowne by experience, eſpecially
theſe latter times:Pſal. 5. 12. for many are the
courteſies which I have received from divers

friends,1 Cor. 16. 18 the which I ſhall ever acknowledge.
But the truth is, the continuance ofPſal. 112. 5. your
great favours, is ſuch a happineſſe to me, as I
muſt needs confeſſe you are to me more like a
Job 29. 16. father then a friend or maſter. And therefore
an ſo much the more obliged unto you.
Pro. 18. 24. In teſtimony thereof, and of the true love
and ſervice I owe you, I humbly dedicate to
you theſe firſt fruits of my poore endeavours,
gathered in my aforeſaid troubles, (when I
wasJer. 32. 2. ſhut up in a miſerable place from the
delights of the world) out ofCant. 5. 1. the ſpirituall
garden of Gods Word; wherefore my hope
is you willPſal. 119. 103. reliſh them ſo much the better,
and vouchſafe them your kinde acceptance,
though publiſhed by ſo weake an Inſtrument
as my ſelfe, whoſe further endeavours (notwithſtanding)
ſhall be to doe ſomewhat more
ſome other way, that may conduce to the publique
welfare, as God (theJam. 1. 5. 17. liberal giver of al
good gifts) ſhall enable me: To whom I commit
both you and all yours, and remaine,



May 18. 1644.
