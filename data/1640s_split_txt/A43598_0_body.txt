To the worthy (and by me much Honoured) Master IAMES METTAM Esquire, &c.
SIR,

BY that generous and noble Character, which long since I have heard confer'd upon you, my sole ambition was to attend so happy an opportuninity as to be any way knowne unto you: But when time so farre seconded my wishes, that upon an unexpected meeting I was made so fortunate, not onely to be admitted into your company, but accepted into your knowledge, (for which I stand much ingaged to your kinseman and friend Mr. T. B.) I instantly apprehended that report came much short of your worth and merit, which (I ingenuously confesse transcended my expectation;) for besides your generous affability and courtesie, (the most gracefull garnish, and best decorements that become and adorn a true-bred Gentleman) finding you not onely generally

addicted to the incouragement of all good Arts, and Sciences, but especially to the professours of Literature and Learning, and when upon further discourse I understood, that you more particularly had not only took view of some of my weake Labors, but crowned them with your Verdict: These inducements so farre emboldned mee, as to offer these my unpolisht papers to your perusall and patronage, which if you shall be pleased to countenance; I shall remayne confident against all malicious prejudice: desiring rather to stand to the judicious censure of one truly rationall, then to the ignorant Nonsence of a numerous rabble. Worthy Sir: complement is a thing I have ever studied to avoid, and (I presume) you were never pleased to affect: then in a word, wishing you the accomplishment of all your noble desires, alternatly corresponding to your worthy deserts, I commend you (my generous Patron) to the Almighties gracious protection, ever remayning,
