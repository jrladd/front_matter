Right Honourable,



I
 Know it will appear strange & preposterous, to many, to see a Poem of this nature, in these distracted and confused times (when scarce the iron hand of Warre is ceast: but like a fearefull and prodigious Commet stil hangs over us, threatning ruine and destruction to this royall Kingdome) set forth to the view and Censure of the World. For, noble Gentlemen, I must ingenuously confesse, it had beene much more sutable to the Times, had it had its birth in our Halcyon dayes, when blest peace and prosperity reigned in our happy Albion: but since 'tis so unhappy to breathe life in this unnaturall age, let it begge your favourable and candid censures: not of Abortive,

but a Posthumus. And now to vindicate my self from foule detraction, which the envious and carying Zoylusses & Momusses of all ages (by their virulent tongues & pens, to prejudice and traduce the workes of others) have too frequently, but most falsely cast upon Writers: I shall endeavour to give you some satisfactory reasons of publishing this my Pamphlet.
As first, because I never heard or read of any booke of this subject, set forth in the English tongue, although in all other languages they are most frequent.
The next is for the benefit, pleasure, or delight of the Reader, especially now in these sad and disconsolate times, it being a great refreshment, and recreation to the minde of man, (by way of divertion) to take him off from the consideration of these danger-threatning times, and entertaine his thoughts, sometimes with sweete variety of matter, according to that saying: Interpone tuis, interdum gaudea curis, ut posses animo, quemvis sufferre laborem.

And lastly, although this Poem is but a collection of divers sentences, phrasers, &c. as appeareth in the Title, (not methodically composed or digested) it being unpossible in a subject of this nature, so to doe) but promiscously intermixt with variety and delight) which many yeares since in times of my better prosperity. I gathered out of some hundreds of Authors, never having the least thought of putting it to Presse. Yet now, by the importunity, or rather the commands of some noble friends, to whose endearements for their noble favours, I owe my gratitude: I have adventured, or rather presumed, (under your noble patronage and protection) to put it into print: And noble Gentlemen, let mee indulge your favours, not to reade it with

prejudicate opinions, for then I know you will doome it to scorne and your contempt: but that you will behold it, with a gracious and favourable aspect, rather pittying then censuring the Author; and where you finde it worthlesse and unusefull, you would bury it in the Ocean of your goodness, thereby you will oblige me for to be,
