Dread Soveraigne,


I Have beheld with regard the crucifying of our Saviour in his name, and the ſhamefull handling of his Church for not aſſenting to the act. A Paper-ſtatue is extant of both, and Dedicated to a Member in Your Houſe of Commons. Againſt it my pen adventures. Whereto Conſcience bindes, thither I

tend. No clouds of horrour ſhall frighten my obedience from God and the King. Acknowledging therefore your Majeſties Supremacy, the next under Chriſt, I appeale unto Caeſar. At the footeſtoole of your Sacred Throne, Mercy may be had in Iudgement. Who hold this againſt any right, I ſue not to them for pardon. That is one way, I am ſure, and enacted too, to ſtrangle the independent Monſter. An evill daily felt: and let me not live to pray, if I pray not God heartily for the Reformation. My Petition to your moſt Excellent Majeſty humbly begges a gracious acceptance of this Primetiall, and the forgiveneſſe of ſuch preſumption. The Almighty ſettle peace, continue the Goſpell, and proſper both: Both under your Majeſties Highneſſe, and your Highneſſe Progeny, till Chriſt come in power and glory.
