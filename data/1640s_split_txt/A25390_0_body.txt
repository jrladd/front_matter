Right Honorable,

MAY it please you in these

troublesome daies of ours, to behold the man, who though (with open mouth) he telleth not all things that every one hath done, Yet (by lively example) teacheth what every one ought to be ready to doe; Even for Kings, and for all that are

in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlinesse, and honesty.
His Person, whilest hee lived, wanted not the love and favour of a King, to advance him to dignity; & let not this Posthume worke of his

lacke your Honors protection and patronage, to keepe it from indignity.
A Midwives care reacheth no further than the safe bringing the Infant into the world, the maintenance and protection thereof, she commendeth to

the Father and other Friends.
This Orphan by my meanes hath happily seene the Light, but wanting a Father, as being deceased before his birth, I presume to commend its defence and tuition to your Honour as a friend, & your Lordshippes

selfe to the gracious protection of the Lord, who grant you ever the continuance of your honour, to you and your posterity for ever:
So prayeth
