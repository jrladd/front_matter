I
 Must ever mention both in private to God, and in publike to the world, the love and favour which J have received from your Congregation, how when J was unknowne, ye owned me, when a stranger, ye tooke me in, when exiled from mine owne, ye made me yours; and that not onely with extraordinary readinesse, when we first did meet, but with constant and continued tendernesse since our meeting: I shall ever strive to the utmost of my desires, and indevours, to make acknowledgement of such receipts, and what J shall faile of in those, to make them up in prayers, and thankes. This present mite that is tendered to you, accept as pledge and earnes
â€¢
 of all these, the value of it is.

as small as the volume; but what it wants of worth and Learning, conceive to be supplyed with observance and gratitude. The multitude of Expositions upon this Booke of Exodus, hath made this of mine so very little; for to set downe what they had done before, were an idle labour, and to finde out something that they had not set downe, was a labour as difficult; what I have done here in this kinde, J referre to the Reader; although J my selfe be setled and satisfyed in the most of them, yet shall J not put them upon the beleefe of any, further than their due examination, and strength of reason shall make their way.


From my House in the upper end of Moore-Lane. Novemb. 28. 1643.
