Right Honourable,


THis plain Sermon, when preached, was entertained by Your Lordſhips with ſingular attention; and now comes to publike view by Your command. I ſhall not preſume now to make another tryall of Your patience, by a long Epiſtle, as I did then in a long Sermon: I onely preſent it unto You, and (ſince You

pleaſe to have it ſo) to the eye of the World, humbly beſeeching the Lord to accompany it with his bleſſing, that all who read it, (eſpecially Your Lordſhips) may in it behold, as in a Glaſſe, the Glorie of the Lord, and be changed into the ſame Image by the Spirit of the Lord; thatſo they may account it their greateſt Honour to promote this Worke; to beautifie the place of Gods Sanctuary,
Eſa. 60. 13. and to make the place of his feet glorious. So prayeth
