SIR,


I Beleeve you
to bee ſuch
Patron of Vertue,
that if this Treatiſe
had the leaſt probability

of cheriſhing Vice,
my Conſcience durſt
not admit a thought of
this Dedication to
your Majeſty.
But my own Reaſon
(ſeconded by better
approbations) aſſures
mee theſe Diſquiſitions
and Prayers are like to
beget grace in thoſe
where it was not, and
confirm it where it was.
And being ſo uſefull,
I dare not doubt your
Patronage of this child,

which ſurvives a Father
whoſe utmoſt abilities
were (till death darkened
that great light in
his ſoule) ſacrificed to
your ſervice.
But, if I could queſtion
your willing protection
of it, I might
ſtrengthen my Petition
for it, by an unqueſtionable
commendation
of the Authors publiſht
Meditations, in
moſt of which (even
thoſe of Poetry begun

in his youth) there are
ſuch tinctures of Piety,
and Pictures of devout
Paſſions, as gain'd him
much love, and many
Noble Friends.
One of that number
(which is not to bee
numbred) was the
Religious, Learned,
Peaceable, Humble Biſhop
of Armagh; whom I
beſeech God to bleſſe,
and make your Majeſty
and him, in theſe
bad, ſad times, inſtruments

of Good to this
diſtracted, diſtemper'd
Church and State.
This is my unfained
Prayer; and I doubt
not but all that wiſh
well to Sion, will ſeale
it with their Amen.
