My LORD;


THe ſecret love of Hero and Leander firſt brought to light in the pure Greek of divine Muſaeus, was afterward

new moulded in Latin by the fluent Ovid; in imitation of whoſe Epiſtles, the moſt eminent Poëts of all Climates have (in their native languages) written upon this ſubject ſo many Paraphraſes and Eſſayes, that like the numerous ſtreames of Nile, they almoſt overflow the remembrance of their Fountaine.
