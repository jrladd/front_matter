SVch is the powerfull, and univerſall
influence, which the great and
noble Conſtellation of your Houſe
bath, under God and the King,
over all that are members of this
State, that none with modeſty may deny your
deſires, or with ſafety (at leaſt of their diſcretion)

diſobey your Commands; So irreſiſtible
a force muſt the intimation of that Will
carry, which proceeds from ſomany wiſe and
excellent judgements united together. This
may ſufficiently juſtifie my obedience, in preſenting
this Sermon to your, and the publique
view: which not any ſelf-forwardneſſe, or
over-valuing hath obtruded. It was enough,
in the Authors opinion (if not too much) that ſo
ſudden and abortive conceptions had once
adventured the Hearing of ſo Learned, Pious,
and Judicious an Aſſembly. Where obtaining
(through Gods bleſsing) ſome approbation, (by
doing ſome good, I hope) they were further, by the
vote of your Honorable Houſe, required to
be Printed: Which they now are; and with all
Humilitie preſented to your Acceptance. That
at once I may, both caſt in a mite to Gods
glory in the publique good (which ſhould be
the end of all our actions) and alſo teſtifie a
minde vehemently ſenſible of, and thankfull
for thoſe free and Noble expreſſions of favour
generally from the whole Houſe, and particularly

from ſome members of it, my ſpeciall
friends, conferred upon me. What good others
may now get from theſe notions, I know not: I
pray, and hope, they may not be wholly uſeleſſe
to candid, pious, and unprejudiced mindes, ſince
your cenſure hath allowed them as fit and neceſſary
for our times.


This I am ſure, your wiſedome and pietie
are (above all others) by the publication of
this Sermon, more ſtraightly obliged in conſcience,
to juſtifie before God and man, your
deſires and opinion of it, by your proceedings
anſwerable to the ſubject and intent of it; which
is the love of Truth and Peace. The ſplendor
of ſo many cleer mindes, concentred in Truth,
cannot but kindle to a publique love of it. And
from the ſacred light, and heate of ſo many wiſe
and warm hearts, the life ſweetneſſe and abundance
of our Peace cannot but grow and
flouriſh.


That this may be the happy ſucceſſe, wherewith

with God will be pleaſed to crown your publique
endevours; as alſo theſe, which from my
private Pen are now adopted unto your ſo great
and Honorable protection, is the earneſt
prayer of
