I Could have given more, and more eaſie and common Obſervations; but theſe
times call for Di courſes that work higher, and more quaintly; I ſay not this to
force any reputation upon the notions.
This Covenant is the moſt glorious riſe of a Reformation in any age;
mighty and powerfull are the Principles of it; and though this ſeaſon of our
Solemnity be cloudie, and our evening bloodie, yet it is our Saviours Interpretation;
When it is evening, you ſay it will be fair weather, for the skie is red.
