LOW shrubs are sheltered by lofty Cedars; I hope the same from your Honour.

The Subject which I present is warlike, though my Profession be peaceable: 'tis compendious, and not traced by many, scarce by any before: I have made the discovery; and referre the whole, being discovered, to your Honors judgment. 'Tis not the meere fancy of a Schollers braine, but many yeares Experience abroad in forraigne Leaguers, with great danger, which produc't it.
Accept it (Great Lord) though presented at no

lesse a distance than the foote is from the Head: and when your weighty Military Ingagements will afford your Honour some small recesse, vouchsafe it a perusall.
I have been so bold to present my selfe, and this small Tract of warre unto your Honours protection, in regard your Honours Regiment ranne the same hazards of warre in Germany with three more of our English Nation, under the Command of our General

the Lord Morgan; wherein I was imbarqued, and with whom I suffered resolutely and willingly the utmost of dangers that a professed Enemy with all his power & policy could proportion for our troops. Secondly, I know your Honours ability to determine of a Subject of this Nature, and to protect both the Parent and the Childe from publicke Injury.

That the Great God of Hosts may safeguard your

Honour, and that your goings Out, and commings In, may be for ever prosperous and successefull, prayes the meanest of
