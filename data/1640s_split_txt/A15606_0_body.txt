IF new or old wit please the reader best,
I've hope each man of wit will be our guest,
The new was fram'd to humor some mens taste;
Which if they like not, they may carve the last:
Each dish hath sauce belongs to't, and you will
By your dislike, censure the Authors skill;
Yet if you cannot speake well of it, spare
To utter your dislike, that the like snare
May entrap others; so the booke may bee
Sold, though not lik'd, by a neate fallacy:
That's all I aske yet'twill your goodnes raise,
If as I gaine your coyn, he may your praise.
