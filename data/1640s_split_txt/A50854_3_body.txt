TO you, whose lives are eaten up with lust,
Your spirits and your names consum'd with rust,
Whose soules are bought and sold, whose bodies will
Vnsheath your wicked practices, to fill
The world with wonder; you, by whom Hell best
Is here, and in her place below exprest:
To you, who poyson earth with your foule deeds,
And from your brest your torment ever feeds,
I do present my lines, if taken well,
They may hedge up your passages to Hell,
And break your league: If not, your damned cause
(Which is condemn'd by my Satyrick Lawes)
Will gender vipers, who will gnaw the sweet,
And bite your bowels, 'till their teeth do meet:
Whence life it selfe, against your health shall strive;
You vassals, are not dead, nor yet alive.


You trim your vice, and will your humours have,
Although your corps are dressing for the grave,
Maintaine your sinfull freedome, prove 'tis more
Disgrace in living chast, than be a whore.
Death hath his charge, your plots being all reveal'd,
Judged by a Statute not to be repeal'd)
Expect the execution; then your pet
Vill no way save you, till you pay the debt;
o which you were engag'd for, with delight,


〈◊〉
 can time bale you; though y'are found by night,
You cannot 'scape away. Ah! well! I must
With such vile Rebels leave my Search in trust.
