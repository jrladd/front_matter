Good Reader,


THE dissentions in our
Church about matters of
Religion, being so great,
as that there is scarce any
thing in practice so well established,
but is by some or other called in
question, and the distempers of the
State being such, as not any man
scarcely knows where to make addresse
for resolution: I do here (as I
hold it my duty) make a publique
presentment and submission of the
judgement, that upon calling my understanding
to an account, I have
been able to make in these matters, to
the pious censure of our Mother the

Church of England, to the end that
from her sincere admonishment,
both thou and I may receive as the
case shall require, either approbation
or rectification in our judgements;
which I heartily wishing, rest,
