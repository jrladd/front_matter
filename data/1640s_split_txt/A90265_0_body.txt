SIR:


HAving of late been deprived of the happineſſe to ſee you,
I make bold to ſend to viſite you; and becauſe that the
times are troubleſome, I have made choiſe of this meſſenger:
who having obtained a licenſe to paſſe, feares no
ſearching: he brings no newes (at leaſt) to you, but that which was
from the beginning, and muſt continue unto the end, which you
have heard, and which (for ſome part thereof) you have practiſed
out of the word of God. He hath no ſecret meſſages prejudiciall to
the ſtate of Church or Common-wealth; neither I hope, will he
entertain any ſuch comments by the way▪ conſidering from whom he
comes, and to whom he goes; of whom, the one would diſclaime him,
and the other puniſh him. Ambitious I am not of any entertainment
for theſe few ſheetes, neither care much what ſucceſſe they find in
their travel; ſetting them out meerly in my own defence, to be freed
from the continued ſolicitations of ſome honeſt judicious men, who
were acquainted with their contents: being nothing, but an houres
Country-diſcourſe, reſolved, from the ordinary pulpit method, into its
own principles: when I firſt thought of ſending it to you, I made ful
account to uſe the benefit of the advantage, in recounting of, and returning
thanks for ſome of thoſe many undeſerved favours which I
have received from you. But addreſſing my ſelf to the performance,
I fainted in the very entrance; finding their ſcore ſo large, that I
know not where to begin, neither ſhould I know how to end: only one
I cannot ſuffer to lye hid in the croud, though other engagements
hindred me from embracing it, viz. your free proffer of an Eccleſiaſtical
preferment, then vacant, and in your donation. Yet truly all received
courteſies, have no power to oblige me unto you, in compariſon

of that abundant worth, which by experience I have found to be
dwelling in you. Twiſe by Gods providence, have I been with you,
when your County hath been in great danger to be ruined, once by
the horrid inſurrection of a rude godleſſe multitude; and againe, by
the invaſion of a potent enemy, prevailing in the neighbor County;
at both which times, beſides the generall calamity juſtly feared, particular
threatnings were daily brought unto you: under which ſad
diſpenſations, I muſt crave leave to ſay (only to put you in mind of
your ſelfe, if it ſhould pleaſe God againe to reduce you to the like
ſtraights) that I never ſaw more reſolved conſtancy, more cheerfull
unmoved Chriſtian courage in any man. Such a valiant heart in a
weak body, ſuch a directing head, where the hand was but feeble,
ſuch unwearied endevours, under the preſſures of a painful infirmity,
ſo well adviſed reſolves in the midſt of imminent danger, did I
then behold, as I know not where to parallel. Neither can I ſay leſſe
in her kind of your vertuous Lady, whoſe known goodneſſe to al, and
particular indulgences to me, make her (as ſhe is in her ſelf) very precious
in my thoughts and remembrance: whom having named, I deſire
to take the advantage thankfully to mention her worthy ſon, my
noble and very deare friend C. Weſtrow, whoſe judgement to diſcerne
the differences of theſe times, and his valour in proſecuting what he
is reſolved to be juſt and lawfull, places him among the number of
thoſe very few, to whom it is given to know aright the cauſes of
things, and vigorouſly to execute holy and laudible deſignes. But further
of him I chooſe to ſay nothing, becauſe if I would, I cannot but
ſay too little. Neither will longer detain you from the enſuing Diſcourſe,
which I deſire to commend to your favourable acceptance,
and with my hearty prayers, that the Lord would meet you and
yours in all thoſe wayes of mercy and grace, which are neceſſary to
carry you along through all your engagements, untill you arrive at
the haven of everlaſting glory, where you would be: I reſt
