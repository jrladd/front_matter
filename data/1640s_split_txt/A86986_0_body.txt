My Lord,


THis Sermon being delivered by a ſon of mine, whom it hath pleaſed God to call to his ſpeciall ſervice in the Miniſtery of his Goſpel, upon the anniverſary day of the Inauguration of our gracious Soveraigne, the 27 of March last. In the paſsing of it, not only thorough my eares (for I may well be deemed partiall) but of diverſe others of the then Auditors (who ſurely could not be partiall) it found ſuch approbation, as wee did not thinke fit it ſhould be confined within thoſe narrow limits of a ſmall Pariſh but that it ſhould bee communicated to others, by this diffuſive way of ſilent ſpeaking by theſe dumb Characters, to the

eyes, eares and hearts of all who pleaſe. My Lord, I have long ſtudied to find out ſome way or other, wherely I might returne ſome acknowledgement of thoſe many undeſerved favours, which I have received from your Lordſhip, and having the free tender of this Sermon, from the Deliverer of it as a pledge of his duty to mee: I could not but think fit (I having nothing elſe ſo worthy) to preſent it to your Lordſhip, the rather; Firſt becauſe the ſubject of it is touching Rulers and Magiſtrates, amongſt which your Lordſhip ſits in none of the loweſt rankes. Secondly, becauſe it teacheth the duty of the people to their Rulers and Magiſtrates, and how they ought to deport themſelves towards them in words and actions. A thing very neceſſary in this licencious age of ours where every man conceives hee may not only thinke what hee list, but utter what he thinkes, be it of the greatest or higheſt: I ſhall humbly deſire your Lordſhip, to ſet apart one vacant houre for the peruſall of it, and conſider it comes from a higher Spirit than from the ſpirit of the Speaker; Wherefore it cannot bee altogether unworthy Your Lordſhips ſparing ſo much time for contemplation of it: We ſhall wiſh it may prove acceptable to Your Lordſhip; And for us, both the Author and the Preſenter,

Wee ſhall ever (as exceedingly obliged) reſt deſirous to take hold of all occaſions to offer to Your Lordſhip all fit teſtimonies of our duties and reſpects and ſhall ever remaine
