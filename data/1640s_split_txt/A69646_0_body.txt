THE Book which among other great and high points of reformation, contains as a principall part thereof, this treatise here presented, Supreme Court of Parlament, was by the famous Author Martin Bucer, dedicated to Edward the sixt: whose incomparable youth doubtless bad brought forth to the Church of England such a glorious manbood, bad his life reacht it, as would have left in the affairs of religion, nothing without an excellent pattern for us now to follow. But since the secret purpose of divine appointment hath reserv'd no lesse perhaps then the just half of such a sacred work to be accomplisht in this age, and principally, as we trust, by your succesful wisdom and authority, religious Lords and Commons, what wonder if I seek no other, to whose exactest judgement, and revieu I may commend these last and worthiest labours of this renowned teacher: whom living, all the pious nobility of those reforming times, your truest and best imitated ancestors, reverenc't and admir'd. Nor was be wanting to a recompence as great as was himself; when both at many times before, and especially among his last sighs and prayers testifying his dear and fatherly affection to the Church and Realm of England, he sincerely wisht in the hearing of many devout men, that what he had in this his last book * Nicol. de obit Bri.written to King Edward concerning discipline, might have place in  this Kingdom. His hope was then that no calamity, no confusion, or deformity would happen to the Common-wealth; but otherwise he fear'd, lest in the midst of all this ardency to know God, yet by the neglect of discipline, our good endeavours would not succeed. These remarkable words of so godly and so eminent a man at his death, as they are related by a sufficient and well known witnes, who heard them and inserted by Thuanus into his grave and serious history, so ought they to be chiesly consider'd by that nation for whose sake they were utter'd, and more especially by that general Counsel which represents the body of that nation. If therfore the book, or this part therof, for necessary causes, be now reviv'd and recommended to the use of this undisciplin'd age, it hence appears that these reasons

have not err'd in the choyee of a fit patronage, for a discourse of such importance. But why the whole tractat is not beer brought entire, but this matter of divorcement selected in particular, to prevent the full speed of some mis-interpreter, I hasten to disclose. First, it will be soon manifest to them who know what wise men should know, that the constitution and reformation of a common-wealth, if Ezra and Nehemiah did not mis-reform, is, like a building, to begin ord

Next, there being yet among many, such a strange iniquity and perversnes against all necessary divorce, while they will needs expound the words of our Saviour not duly by comparing other places, as they must doe in the resolving of a hunder'd other Scriptures, but by persisting deafely in the abrupt and Papistical way
•
 of a literal apprehension against the direct analogy of sense, reason, law and Gospel, it therfore may well seem more then time to apply the sound and holy persuasions of this Apostolic man, to that part in us, which is not yet fully dispossest of an error as absurd, as most that we deplove in our blindest adversaries; and to let his autority and unanswerable reasons be vulgarly known, that either his name, or the force of his doctrine may work a wholsom effect. Lastly, I find it cleer to be the authors intention that this point of divorcement should be 
•
eld and receav'd as a most necessary and prime part of discipline in every Christian government. And therfore having reduc't his model of reformation to 14. heads, he bestows almost as much time about this one point of divorce, as about all the rest; which also was the judgement of his heirs and learned friends in Germany, best acquainted with his meaning; who first publishing this his book by Oporinus at Basil (a Citie for learning and constancie in the the true faith, honorable among the first) added a special note in the title, that there the reader should finde the doctrine of Divorce handl'd so solidly, and so fully, as scars the like in any Writer of that age: and with this particular commendation they doubted not to dedicate the book, as a most profitable & exquisit discours, to Christian the 3d, a worthy & pious King of Denmark, as the author himself had done before to our Edward the sixt. Yet did not Bucer in that volume only declare what his constant opinion was herein, but also in his comment upon

Matthew, written at Strasburgh divers years before, he treats distinctly and copiously the same argument in three severall places; touches it also upon the 7. to the Romans, & promises the same solution more largely upon the 1. to the Corintbians, omitting no occasion to weed out this last and deepest mischief of the Canon law sown into the opinions of modern men against the lawes and practice both of Gods chosen people, and the best primitive times. Wheri
•
 his faithfulnes and powerful evidence prevail'd so farre with all the Church of Strasburgh, that they publisht this doctrine of divorce, as an article of their confession, after they had taught so eight and twenty years, through all those times, when that Citie flourisht, and excell'd most, both in religion, lerning, and good government, under those first restorers of the Gospel there, Zellius, Hedio, Capito, Fagius, and those who incomparably then govern'd the Common-wealth, Farrerus and Sturmius. If therefore God in the former age found out a servant, and by whom he had converted and reform'd many a citie, by him thought good to restore the most needfull doctrine of divorce from rigorous and harmfull mistakes on the right hand, it can be no strange thing if in this age be stirre up by whatsoever means whom it pleases him, to take in hand & maintain the same assertion. Certainly if it be in mans discerning to sever providence from chance, I could allege many instances, wherin there would appear cause to esteem of me no other then a passive instrument under some power and counsel higher and better then can be human, working to a general good in the whole cours of this matter. For that I ow no light, or leading receav'd from anyman in the discovery of this truth, what time I first undertook it in the doctrine and discipline of divorce, and had only the infallible grounds of Scripture to be my guide, he who tries the inmost heart, and saw with what severe industry and examination of my self, I set down ever

For God, it seems, intended to prove me, whether I durst alone take up a rightful cause against a world of disesteem, & found I durst. My name I did not publish, as not willing it should sway the reader either for me or against me. But when I was told, that the stile, which what it ailes to be so soon distinguishable, I cannot tell, was known by most men, and that some of the Clergie began to inveigh and exclaim on what I was credibly inform'd they had not read, I took it then for my proper season both to shew them a name that could easily contemn such as indiscreet kind of censure, and to reinforce the question with a more

Nevertheless being farre otherwise dealt with by some, of whose profession and supposed knowledge I had better hope, and esteem'd the deviser of a new and pernicious paradox, I felt no difference within me from that peace & firmnes of minde, which is of neerest kin to patience and contentment: both for that I knew I had divulg'd a truth linkt inseparably with the most fundamental rules of Christianity, to stand or fall together, and was not un-inform'd that divers lerned and judicious men testify'd their d

ntious, new and dangerous, which Martin Bucer so often, and so urgently avoucht to be most lawfull, most necessary, and most Christian, without the lest blemish to his good name, among all the worthy men of that age, and since, who testifie so highly of him? If they dare, they must then set up an arrogance of their own against all those Churches and Saints who honour'd him without this exception: If they dare not, how can they now make that licentious doctrin in another, which was never blam'd, or confuted in Bucer, or in Fagius? The truth is, there will be due to them for this their unadvised rashnes, the best donative that can be giv'n them, I mean, a round reproof; now that where they thought to be most Magisterial, they have display'd their own want, both of reading, and of judgement. First, to be so unacquainted in the writings of Bucer, which are so obvious and so usefull in their own faculty; next, to be so caught in a prejudicating weaknes, as to condemn that for lewd, which (whether they knew or not) these elect servants of Christ commended for lawfull; and for new, that which was taught by these almost the first and greatest authors of reformation, who were never taxt for so teaching; and dedicated without scruple to a royall pair of the first reforming Kings in Christendom, and confest in the public confession of a most orthodoxall Church & state in Germany. This is also another fault which I must tell them; that they have stood now almost this whole year clamouring a farre off, while the book hath bin twice printed, twice bought up, & never once vouchs

Or if he be obstinat, their confutation would have render'd him without excuse, and reclam'd others of no mean parts who incline to his opinion. But now their work is more then doubl'd; and how they will hold up their heads against the sudden aspect of these two great and reverend S

However, if we know at all, when to ascribe the occurrences of this life to the work of a special providence, as nothing is more usual in the talk of good men, what can be more like to a special providence of God, then in the first reformation of England, that this question of divorce, as a main thing to be restor'd to just freedom, was writt'n, and seriously c

Think not that God rais'd up in vain a man of greatest a

ority in the Church to tell a trivial and licentious tale in the eares of that good Prince, and to bequeath it as his last will and testament, nay rather as the testamont and royall law of Christ to this Nation, or that it should of it self after so many yeares, as it were in a new feild where it was never sow'n, grow up again as a vitious plant in the minde of another, who had spoke honestest things to the Nation; though he knew not that what his youth then reason'd without a pattern, had bin heard already, and well allow'd from the gravity and worth of Martin Bucer: till meeting with the envy of men ignorant in thir own undertak'n calling, God directed him to the forgott'n Writings of this faithfull Evangelist, to be his defence and warrant against the gross imputation of broaching licence. Ye are now in the glorious way to high vertu, and matchless deeds, trusted with a most inestimable trust, the asserting of our just liberties. Ye have a nation that expects now, and from mighty suffrings aspires to be the example of all Christendom to a perfetest reforming.

and privileges worth, and how shall it be judg'd that we sight for them with minds worthy to enjoy them, if wee suffer our selvs in the mean while not to understand the most important freedom that God and Nature hath givn us in the family; which no wise Nation ever wanted, till the Popery and superstition of some former ages attempted to remove and alter divine and most prudent Laws for human and most imprudent Canons; whereby good men in the best portion of t

st barbarism of Antichristian times. But why doe I anticipate the more acceptable, and prevailing voice of lerned Bucer himself, the pastor of Nations? And O that I could set him living before ye in that doctoral chair, where once the lernedest of England thought it no disparagement to sit at his feet▪ He would be such a pilot, and such a father to ye, as ye would soon find the difference of his hand and skill upon the helm of reformation. Nor doe I forget that faithfull associate of his labours, Paulus Fagius; for these thir great names and merits, how pretious so ever, God hath now joyn'd with me necessarily, in the good or evil report of this doctrin which I leav with you. It was writt'n to a religious King of this land; writt'n earnestly, as a main matter wher in this kingdom needed a reform, if it purpos'd to be the kingdom of Christ: Writt'n by him who if any since the d

aried pains and watching for our sakes, as they spent him quickly heer among us, so did they, during the shortnes of his life, incredibly promote the Gospel throughout this Realm. The autority, the lerning, the godlines of this man consulted with, is able to out-ballance all that the lightnes of a vulgar opposition can being to counterpoise. I leav him also as my complete suretie and testimonial, if Truth be not the best witnes to it self, that what I formerly presented to your reading on this subject, was good, and just, and honest, not licentious. Not that I have now more confidence by the addition of these great Authors to my party; for what I wrote was not my opinion, but my knowledge; evn then when I could trace no footstep in the way I went: nor that I think to win upon your apprehensions with numbers and with names, rather then wi

tracters will not except against so good a baile of my integritie and judgement, as now appeares for me. They must els put in the fame of Bucer and of Fagins, as my accomplices

and confederats into the same endightment; they must dig up the good name of these prime worthies (if thir names could be ever buried) they must dig them up and brand them as the Papists did thir bodies; and those thir pure unblamable spirits, which live not only in heaven, but in thir writings, they must attaint with new attaintures which no Protestant ever before aspers't them with. Or if perhaps wee may obtain to get our appeachment new drawn a Writ of Error, not of Libertinism, that those two principal leaders of reformation may not come now to be su'd in a bill of licence, to the scandal of, our Church, the brief result will be, that for the error, if thir own works be not thought sufficient to defend them, there livs yet who will be ready, in a fair and christianly discussive way, to debate and sift this matter to the utmost ounce of lerning and religion, in him that shall lay it as an error, either upon Martin Bueer, or any other of his opinion. If this be not anough to qualifie my traducers, and that they think it more for the wisdom of thir virulence, not to recant the injuries they have bespoke me, I shall not for much more disturbance then they can bring me, intermitt the prosecution of those thoughts which may render me best serviceable, either to this age, or if it so happ'n, to posteritie; following the fair path which your illustrious exploits, Honourd Lords and Commons, against the brest of tyrany have open'd; and depending so on your happy successes in the hopes that I have conceiv'd either of my self, or of the Nation, as must needs conclude me one who most affectionately wishes and awaits the prosperous issue of your noble and valorous counsels.
